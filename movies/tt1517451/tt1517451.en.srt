1
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,222
- (Crowd cheering)
- (Tuning instruments)

2
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,699
Get to it.

3
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,997
(Crowd cheering loudly)

4
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,341
(Playing rock music)

5
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:26,204
(Singing) Black eyes open wide
it's time to testify

6
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:31,498
there is no room for lies
and everyone's waiting for you

7
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,792
then I'm gone
sitting by the phone

8
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,963
and I'm all alone by the wayside

9
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,851
And I'm gone
sitting by the phone

10
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,859
and I'm all alone by the wayside

11
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,304
- Woman: Jackson!
- (Fans clamoring)

12
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,975
(Coughing)

13
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,195
(Sighs deeply)

14
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,956
- (Clears throat)
- (High-pitched ringing)

15
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,037
(Exhales sharply)

16
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,927
Ally: Roger.

17
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,512
(Ally sighs)

18
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,687
You're a wonderful man, yes,
and you're a great lawyer.

19
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,181
We're just not meant to be together.

20
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,404
No, I don't wanna marry you!
Are you crazy?

21
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,110
The hell's the matter with you?

22
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,822
Roger, we're done.

23
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,573
Oh, my god.

24
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,334
Fuck! God!

25
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,127
(Shouts in frustration)

26
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,167
Fucking men!

27
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:45,968
Did he cry?

28
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,805
Yeah, he cried. He laughed.
He yelled at me.

29
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,915
- You know, whatever.
- You broke his heart, mama.

30
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,999
You know, I did the right thing.
It just wasn't right...

31
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,183
Bryan: Ally, garbage!

32
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,420
Oh, hey, Bryan. Can you get
somebody else to do it for me?

33
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,484
You have to let her shine!

34
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,106
Bryan: It's your fucking turn!

35
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,925
- Ally: Oh, my god!
- Who the fuck is he talking to?

36
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,314
Okay, I'll see you upstairs.

37
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,279
Ramon: Come on, Bryan!
She's performing tonight!

38
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,953
Here we go. Taking out the trash.
Wipe your mouth.

39
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,143
I'll let you go early,
but you gotta finish your job.

40
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,624
Ally: Well, you gotta keep
your mouth clean. Okay?

41
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,327
(Humming)

42
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:32,766
(Singing) When all the world
is a hopeless jumble

43
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:38,354
and the raindrops tumble all around

44
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:45,992
heaven opens a magic Lane

45
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:53,366
when all the clouds darken up the skyway

46
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:59,960
there's a rainbow highway to be found

47
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,051
Jack: (Sighs) Where the fuck are we?

48
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:09,132
Phil: We are, uh, east of the city.

49
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,469
Jack: Is there any more?

50
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,226
- No. No, sorry, Jack.
- (Coughing)

51
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,980
And it's about an hour-forty
with traffic till we get there.

52
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,186
Walit, really? Yeah.

53
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,102
Jack: I think we can find something
around here.

54
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,759
Phil: No, I'll find something.
I'll find something.

55
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,068
Jack: How's your kid?

56
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,451
How old is he now?

57
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,281
- He is 17.
- Fuck me.

58
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,995
And, uh, he got a scholarship to
play baseball in college already, man.

59
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,079
Jack: Wow, that's great.

60
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,660
Phil: I'm proud of him.

61
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,705
My little guy is not so little anymore.

62
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,169
Jack: I don't wanna go home.

63
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,011
Wish I could find you a spot.

64
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,621
Sorry, Jack, I don't know this area.

65
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,344
Jack: Why don't you make a right here?

66
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,974
Phil: You sure? Jack: Yeah.

67
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,103
Phil: All right.

68
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,939
Here we go.
That looks like a fucking bar.

69
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,940
- Here?
- What's that say, "bleu bleu"?

70
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,022
Here, let me just try this.

71
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,942
Ramon: Oh, shit!
(Slow music playing)

72
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,698
Wait, wait.

73
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,454
My man, my man, I...

74
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,394
- Aren't you that... aren't you, like...
- This is a bar, right?

75
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,229
Yeah, but I don't know
if this is your kind of place.

76
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,493
Jack: They got alcohol?

77
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,952
Ramon: Well, yeah, but...
Jack: Oh, it's my kind of place.

78
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,997
Oh, shit! This is crazy!

79
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,778
- (Music continues playing)
- (Crowd cheering)

80
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,042
How are you doin', papo?

81
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,781
How am I doin'? I'm doin' all right
if I can get a fucking drink.

82
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,805
- You good?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,890
Ramon: Oh, my gosh!

84
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,159
Jack: Oh, yeah. There's the bar.

85
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,764
This is my homegirl,
Giselle de la isma.

86
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,872
- Hey, how you doin'? Hey.
- Oh, yeah. That's Jack. That's Jack.

87
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,206
(Lip-synching) Oh, yeah, yeah, at last

88
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,265
Ramon: Excuse me, papo!

89
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,477
Can we get this man
anything he wants, please?

90
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,643
Can I get a gin on the rocks
with a twist, please?

91
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,029
The skies above are blue

92
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,032
papo, wow.

93
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,405
Oh, my gosh. I'm freaking out right now.

94
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,990
Hey, is this a drag bar?

95
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,081
Yeah, papo. Yeah, yeah.

96
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,906
But look, we do this every Friday night.

97
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,790
Yo, it's crazy. It's so lit, though.

98
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,953
I thought maybe I was in
some sort of hallucinogenic state.

99
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,151
- My honor, or something...
- No, no, no. All are welcome.

100
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,736
A dress or something.
“All are welcome.

101
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,738
You gonna have something?
Here, let me get you a drink.

102
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,627
Okay. Yeah. Wow.

103
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,700
Emcee: You better get out there
and kill 'em tonight.

104
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,680
All you ladies kill it tonight, okay?

105
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,203
Performer 1: I'm ready.
Performer 2: I always do!

106
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,468
Ladies, make sure
you turned in your music already.

107
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,854
Don't make me have
to come get you tonight.

108
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,685
This is a professional show.

109
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,730
Jack: Right. (Crowd cheering)

110
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,311
Oh yes! (Laughs) You stayed!

111
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,800
That's good. That's good, I like it.

112
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,345
- Everything good? You good?
- Yeah, I was just talking to Nicki.

113
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,347
- You know Nicki?
- Hello, Nicki. How you doin', baby?

114
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,363
She's telling me her life story.
Fascinating.

115
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,310
- My homegirl's about to perform.
- And y'all know her very well

116
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,370
because she used to work here
as a server.

117
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,456
But tonight,
the only thing she's serving

118
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,334
are some fabulous, French live vocals.

119
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,416
(Crowd cheering)

120
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,214
Is she really singing, though,

121
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,452
- or is it one of those karaoke things?
- No, no, no. She's really singing, papo.

122
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,578
- I promise you, she's really singing.
- Okay.

123
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,602
Watch this. Watch.

124
00:07:59,229 --> 00:07:59,263
(Music playing) (Crowd cheering)

125
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,636
(Music playing) (Crowd cheering)

126
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,648

(Crowd cheering)

128
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,376
(Crowd whooping)

129
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,454
(Continues singing in French)

130
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,768
(Crowd cheering)

131
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,081
Would anybody like
some French tips tonight?

132
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,141
(Ally singing in French)

133
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,361
(Crowd cheering)

134
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,327
(Continues singing in French)

135
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,889
(Music ends) (Crowd cheering)

136
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,727
Yes, baby! Yes, baby!

137
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,232
(Both laughing)

138
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,358
Oh, fuck.

139
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,531
Oh, papo, you crying?
“A little bit.

140
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,529
(Laughing continues)

141
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,576
You have to meet her.

142
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,058
What's that?
You have to meet her!

143
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,323
Oh, no, I can't meet her.
Yes! Come on.

144
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,913
Ally: Donte, you got a rag, honey?
Thank you.

145
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,191
Emcee: Miss ally, mama,

146
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,734
you gonna pick something else next week?

147
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:16,758
I don't know.

148
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:17,987
Emcee: Look at her,
she's doing languages now.

149
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,717
- Do Morocco.
- Ally: No! (Chuckles)

150
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,049
- This is my friend, Jackson Maine.
- Jack: Hey.

151
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,284
- This is Jackson Maine.
- Hey.

152
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,844
- How are you? Hey.
- Hey! Oh, my god!

153
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,538
Ramon: Right? This is my friend, ally.

154
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,635
Oh, my god! Hi. Jack: Hi. Hey.

155
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,428
I thought that might be you.

156
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,376
- What'd you say?
- I thought that might be you.

157
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
That's me.

158
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,004
Emerald: Thank you!
You wanna sit down?

159
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,589
Jack: Um... no! You've been
on your feet all night.

160
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,274
No! You're our guest, you're our guest.

161
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,530
You sure you don't mind?
“A little drink?

162
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,219
I'm here watching the show,
watching you guys.

163
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,345
- Emerald: Word!
- Yeah, yeah.

164
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,969
- Emerald: Will you sign my boob?
- Sure.

165
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,307
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Ramon: Oh, my god!

166
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,491
Emerald: Give me a sharpie!

167
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,072
It's byob around here.

168
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,603
- Yeah, is that right?
- "Bring your own boobs."

169
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,915
Oh, god! Those aren't really her boobs?

170
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,586
(Chuckling)

171
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,038
Wow!

172
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,627
So why are you in here, hon?

173
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,212
- Sorry?
- What brings you here?

174
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,844
Oh, I was playing right around
here tonight. I'm a musician.

175
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,346
How'd your show go?

176
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,255
Uh... I think it went all right.

177
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,259
- Okay, here we go. All right.
- Thank you!

178
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,266
- That's all right?
- Ally: Oh, my.

179
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,313
(Squeals)
“Which one should I do?

180
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,224
- Do 'em both! I don't care!
- Select!

181
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,631
Jack: Why don't I just do it across...
Emerald: Bitch, it's Jackson Maine!

182
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,095
Jack: I'll just...
Ramon: Oh, my god!

183
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,592
(Emerald exclaiming in delight)

184
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,152
Emcee: She will stop at nothing.

185
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,992
- You gotta blow on it!
- Jack: I did it pretty big.

186
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:27,572
Oh, you got it. Okay.

187
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,783
Thank you so much!
You all gotta go home,

188
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,398
but you know the phrase.
You gotta get the hell up outta here!

189
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,039
'Cause tonight, I'm not losing
my virginity or my liquor license

190
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,953
over you bitches, so pack up!

191
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,771
- That's right!
- That's enough cocktails!

192
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,253
Emcee: Clear it out!
Hello, goodbye, Roger.

193
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,427
Have fun!

194
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,281
- (Both chuckle)
- Emcee: Bring the drinks on out!

195
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,590
Do you do that often?

196
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,927
- Do what?
- The show.

197
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,638
Yeah, yeah.
The girls are so nice to me here.

198
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:54,430
I mean, they would never normally
let a girl sing at one of these shows,

199
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,393
but they've always loved my voice.

200
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,807
They used to beg me to sing.

201
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,603
It's an honor, really.
I get to be one of the gay girls.

202
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,442
Is that your real eyebrow?

203
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,234
Um... no. No.

204
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,403
I make it out of tape.

205
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,740
- Oh, so it's like, stuck on?
- Mmm-hmm.

206
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,665
Can I try to take it off?

207
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,921
Uh... yeah, sure.

208
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,712
Jack: It's incredible what they do.

209
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,184
Look at that.

210
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,600
Oh! (Laughs) Yep. There it is.

211
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,393
- I should put her down somewhere.
- Okay.

212
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,810
There we go.

213
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,309
Why are you covering your eye?

214
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,632
Oh, just 'cause I don't have
my eyebrow on anymore.

215
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,238
Oh, no, no.
The whole point is I can see your face.

216
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,653
Yeah, there we go.

217
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,908
Why did you come back here?

218
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,210
Your friend brought me back here.
But I'm glad he did.

219
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,875
Can I buy you a drink?

220
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,336
Oh. (Stammerys)

221
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,760
I gotta change,
and I've got paint in my hair.

222
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,366
- That's not your real hair?
- My eyebrows are...

223
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,472
No, my hair is like your color.

224
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,179
- Oh, okay.
- But, um, I paint it with this

225
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,400
- makeup.
- I'd love to see what that looks like.

226
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,230
I'll wait for you.

227
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,277
Um... yeah, okay. Sure.

228
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,234
Yeah, if you wanna wait,
I'll come have a drink with you.

229
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,408
Sure.

230
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,948
Bitch, can you get down off that stage
and come help me close this bar, please?

231
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,476
Emerald: Don't talk to me like that
in that bus-driver wig, girl.

232
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,700
Emcee: Oh, I know you did not.

233
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,909
What, you have
a street appointment tonight, sister?

234
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,189
- (Laughing)
- Emerald: Excuse me!

235
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,669
Mr. Maine, would you mind?

236
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,209
Jack: Uh... what do you want me to do?

237
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,249
Just come play a little song for me.

238
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,427
I don't know.

239
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,697
Emcee: Can you leave
the man alone, please?

240
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,882
I showed you mine, you show me yours.
Come on.

241
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,092
He already signed your tits, honey.
Say no, sir.

242
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,372
Emerald: Show off for me a little bit.

243
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,512
I'll only do it
because you already performed.

244
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,089
Emerald: You're so nice. Thank you.

245
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,396
Emcee: Lord, the man is here for ally.
Not for you, sister.

246
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,604
- Oh, she's nice. Yeah.
- Isn't it cute? Little arts and crafts.

247
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,397
- Yeah, and light.
- Mmm-hmm_

248
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,028
- Did you do this yourself?
- Yeah, all me.

249
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,366
Well, it's great.

250
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,247
Does this mic work?

251
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,034
Oh, yeah. Fuck, all right.

252
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,662
What do you want me to play?

253
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,813
I don't care,
just look at me while you do it.

254
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,623
Emcee: Oh, lord! Somebody kill me now.

255
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,038
Let me see what I can... all right.

256
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,669
(Playing country music)

257
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,680
(Singing) Maybe it's time
to let the old ways die

258
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,725
maybe it's time to let the old ways die

259
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:49,066
it takes a lot to change a man
hell, it takes a lot to try

260
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,153
maybe it's time to let the old ways die

261
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,988
nobody knows what waits for the dead

262
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,003
nobody knows what waits for the dead

263
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,792
some folks just believe
in the things they've heard

264
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,131
and the things they've read

265
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,764
nobody knows what waits for the dead

266
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:23,555
I'm glad I can't go back
to where I came from

267
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:29,728
I'm glad those days are gone
gone for good

268
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:36,234
if I could take spirits
from my past and bring 'em here

269
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:41,991
you know I would
you know I would

270
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:45,835
(music ends)

271
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,207
(People applauding)

272
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,413
You're ready?

273
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,089
Emerald: You know I would!
Jack: Okay.

274
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,292
Jack: It's a cop bar.
Ally: Cops?

275
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,391
Jack: Yeah, that's why
they serve all night long.

276
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,464
(Rock music playing)

277
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,718
(Jack sighs deeply)

278
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,011
Can I ask you a personal question?

279
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,105
Uh, sure.

280
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,355
Do you write songs or anything?

281
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,941
I don't sing my own songs.

282
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,393
- (Glass thudys)
- Jack: Thank you.

283
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:12,906
Why?

284
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,989
I just don't feel comfortable.

285
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,119
Why wouldn't you feel comfortable?

286
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,958
Um...

287
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:27,244
Well, 'cause almost every single person
that I've come in contact with

288
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,037
in the music industry has told me
that my nose is too big

289
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,501
and that I won't make it.

290
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,667
- Your nose is too big?
- Yeah.

291
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,294
Your nose is beautiful.

292
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,408
Are you showing me your nose right now?

293
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,493
Yeah.
You don't have to show it to me.

294
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,577
I've been looking at it all night.

295
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,662
Oh, come on. No, you're not.

296
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,163
I'm gonna be thinking about your nose
for a very long time.

297
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,373
- You're full of shit.
- I'm not full of shit.

298
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,541
- Yeah, you are.
- I'm telling you the truth.

299
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,251
- Yeah, you're full of shit.
- Can I touch your nose?

300
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,275
Oh, my gosh!

301
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,362
- (Chuckles)
- Let me just touch it for a second.

302
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,576
You're very lucky.

303
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,238
- Oh, really? Yeah, not really.
- Mmm-hmm.

304
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,282
My nose has not made me lucky.

305
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,123
I could've had maybe a hit song
if it wasn't for my nose.

306
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,583
That's fucking bullshit.

307
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,544
Yeah. No, it's not bullshit
because you go into these rooms

308
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,425
and there's all these fucking men
in there

309
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,588
and they're just staring at you,
listening to your record, going,

310
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,507
"oh, you sound great,
but you don't look so great."

311
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,808
You know, I had a thing
when I was little.

312
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,433
I was born with this thing in my ear,
couldn't hear.

313
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,770
What do I wind up being?
A singer, so you never know.

314
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,944
Look, talent comes everywhere.
Everybody's talented.

315
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,322
Bet you fucking everybody
in this bar is talented

316
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,780
in one thing or another,
but having something to say

317
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,036
and the way to say it
so people listen to it,

318
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,286
that's a whole other bag.

319
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,707
And unless you get out there
and you try to do it, you'll never know.

320
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,163
That's just the truth.

321
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,857
If there's one reason
we're supposed to be here,

322
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,681
it's to say something
so people wanna hear it.

323
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,445
Don't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

324
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,754
Yeah, I do.

325
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,920
I don't like it, but I understand it.

326
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,134
Oh, I think you like it a little bit.

327
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,434
I think I'm getting through
a little bit. I can see it.

328
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,352
No, you can't.

329
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,730
It's a good thing we met.

330
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,187
- Yeanh.
- For both of us.

331
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,273
- Trust me.
- I don't know what is going on.

332
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,153
Honestly, what... “Who does?

333
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,566
I'm in a cop bar, with Jackson Maine.
It's, like...

334
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:22,888
- (Country music playing)
- Jackson Maine!

335
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,056
I'm gonna wake up in a minute.

336
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,432
That's the thing
about when you get famous,

337
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,617
people start saying your full name.

338
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,166
Well, what do you want...
“Just "Jack."

339
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,951
Oh, speaking of...

340
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,126
Come on.

341
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,170
- What?
- Did you put that on?

342
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,884
You put that on.
When did you even go to the jukebox?

343
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,339
Oh, god!

344
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,051
I hear that song,
and I just wanna turn it the fuck off.

345
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,952
- Tommy: Jack Maine!
- I fucked that fucking song up so bad.

346
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,217
- No! What? Come on.
- Oh, my god!

347
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,845
Hey, I know that
we're not supposed to do this.

348
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,519
I know that we're not supposed
to come and bother you.

349
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,128
- You come here every night.
- That's all right.

350
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,005
You got your camera on you?
'Cause I don't have my camera.

351
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,029
Excuse me, one sec.

352
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,357
- My ex-girlfriend was fucking this guy.
- Right. Okay.

353
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,510
Who looks like you,
that's what she said.

354
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,534
Ally: Shut the hell up.

355
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,638
But I gotta take a picture of you
because I gotta send it to her,

356
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,349
because I'm gonna show her that you look
nothing fucking like that fucking guy.

357
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,351
Officer: Jack, I'm sorry.
Jack: Maybe that'll help her out.

358
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,366
Will that help you out?
Will that make you happy?

359
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,814
- Why don't we take the fucking picture?
- You want someone to take the picture?

360
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,023
- Hey, no, no. It's okay.
- Tommy: Excuse me.

361
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,942
- You want someone to take the picture?
- Get the fuck off, you little whore.

362
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,206
What? What?

363
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,420
- Hey, come on. Stand up, yeah.
Ally: What?

364
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,713
(Ally laughing)

365
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,510
- I'm sorry! No, Jack!
- I got you.

366
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,361
- It's all right. No, no, it's all right.
- Oh, my god! Why did I...

367
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,725
I'm fine, honestly. I'm okay.
This is so stupid.

368
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,139
No, you gotta get ahead of the swelling.

369
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,191
Just trying to find some...

370
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,272
This is so embarrassing.

371
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,031
Here we go. Yeah, put that on there.

372
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,863
Gotta wrap something up with it.
Find it.

373
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,829
- You like cheetos?
- No, like gauze.

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,410
- Some gauze or something.
- Gauze?

375
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,871
Jack: Try to do that. With that hand.

376
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,286
And do that hand.

377
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,625
You play piano?

378
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,612
Yeah, we gotta take care of this, then.

379
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,048
Oh, okay. Thanks.

380
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,915
And that's it, yeah.
No, but keep that on there, hold on.

381
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,679
Can you do that? Yeah. Did you get it?

382
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,478
It's already gotten warm, hasn't it?

383
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,852
- Should we have gotten two?
- It's okay. No, it's okay.

384
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:22,821
- Thanks.
- (Camera clicks)

385
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,153
I'm sorry. I had to.

386
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,692
That's all right.

387
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,616
- It's not really all right, though.
- Have a good one.

388
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,352
- Be careful, she'll hit you.
- (Object clattering)

389
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,582
(Both laughing)

390
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,545
Jack: These rings are gonna get stuck
if you don't take them off.

391
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,920
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

392
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,675
- That's okay, though.
- May 1?

393
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,052
Yeanh.

394
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,338
(Laughing)

395
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,977
Safekeeping.

396
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,064
Put this on there.
You're a sweetheart.

397
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,975
And we'll just wrap it up.

398
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,768
You'll be good to go.

399
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,359
How the hell do you deal
with that all the time?

400
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,149
- What's that?
- People just

401
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,047
talking to you
like you're not a real person

402
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,004
- or taking your picture.
- Is that too tight?

403
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,449
Uh, it's okay, thanks.

404
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,457
- Oh. I hurt you.
- That's fine, it's okay. Ow...

405
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,207
There we go. Now, you're mobile.

406
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,297
Swing it around.

407
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,543
(Ally laughing)

408
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:24,874
I look like a pirate.

409
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,168
Right?
I told you it was worth coming here.

410
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,428
How do you do that?

411
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,759
- Do what?
- Don't change the subject.

412
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,222
- Is that what I'm doing?
- Nobody ever asks you about you, huh?

413
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,680
- Not sure.
- Where are you from?

414
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,143
Arizona.

415
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,150
- Arizona boy.
- Mmm-hmm.

416
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,570
Dad had a midlife crisis, I think.

417
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,488
So I've been told.

418
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:54,491
Made his way to Arizona, started working
for this family on a pecan ranch.

419
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,705
- A pecan ranch?
- Yeah.

420
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:03,205
Knocked up the family's daughter.
She was just shy of 18.

421
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,130
Uh-oh. (Laughing)

422
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,166
That's when I came into the picture.

423
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,947
- Okay. The son of an 18-year-old.
- Yeah.

424
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,006
(Both laughing)

425
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,338
Well, she died at childbirth.

426
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,299
- Then, my dad...
- I'm sorry.

427
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,138
He, uh...

428
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,391
He died when I was 13,

429
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,649
so I guess my brother would tell you
that he raised me,

430
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,110
but I don't know.
I don't know who was raising who.

431
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:32,401
Just 127 acres of nuts, navajo,
and nowhere to go.

432
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,585
(Singing) Tell me something, boy

433
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,794
aren't you tired,
trying to fill that void

434
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:59,018
or do you need more

435
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,895
ain't it hard,
keeping it so hardcore

436
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:09,771
is that me?

437
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,650
That's you.

438
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,200
- Did you just write that now?
- Yeah.

439
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,698
It's pretty good.

440
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:23,747
(Singing) I'm falling

441
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,129
(sighs heavily)

442
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:36,097
In all the good times
I find myself

443
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:45,982
longing for change

444
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,444
I started writing this song
the other day...

445
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,205
And maybe that could work,
like as a chorus or something.

446
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,962
I have to think
if I can remember it. Uh...

447
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:14,423
(Singing) I'm off the deep end

448
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,304
watch as I dive in

449
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:27,558
I'll never meet the ground

450
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,688
crash through the surface

451
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:37,483
where they can't hurt us

452
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:44,082
we're far from the shallow now

453
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,867
- holy shit.
- (Laughing)

454
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,125
What is this?

455
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,587
Was this supposed to help me?

456
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,226
Can I tell you a secret?

457
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,105
(Whispers) I think
you might be a songwriter.

458
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,113
But don't worry, I won't tell anybody.

459
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,031
But I'm not very good
at keeping secrets.

460
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,536
(Both laughing)

461
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,964
You're a real gentleman.

462
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,878
I think. (Laughs)

463
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,128
Ally: Thank you, sir.
It's right here, on the right.

464
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,421
- Right there?
- Jack: Which one?

465
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,060
Ally: This one. Jack: Oh, yeah.

466
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,570
What's all this?

467
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,237
Oh, it's my dad. It's a long story.

468
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,484
Jack: What's he, a sheikh?

469
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,785
(Laughs)

470
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,870
No, he's a driver.

471
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,288
Hey, I got a gig. You wanna come?

472
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,051
- When?
- Phil: We're headed to the airport now.

473
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,839
- Tonight.
- Tonight? No, I can't.

474
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,876
I gotta go to work later.
I gotta go to bed.

475
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,841
Who's gonna take care of your hand?
I messed it up, and...

476
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,425
- Me.
- No, no!

477
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,203
- I'll take care of my hand.
- It's my fault I took you to that place.

478
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,843
- That's okay.
- No, listen. Hey!

479
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,848
- You have my number.
- Okay. All right.

480
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:33,943
(Door closes)

481
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,646
Hey.

482
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,824
What?

483
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,491
I just wanted to take
another look at you.

484
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,739
(Chuckles)

485
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:05,885
(Sighs)

486
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,058
I don't know, maybe I fucked that up.

487
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,018
Phil: No.

488
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,267
- Ally: Hi, dad.
- Pretty late, pretty late.

489
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,894
- Oh, is it late?
- Yeah.

490
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,188
Look at you, you don't even know
where you're walking.

491
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,899
- Come on.
- Well, I wanna go to bed.

492
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:24,237
No, come in for two minutes.
It's Wolfie's birthday, come on!

493
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,743
- Two minutes!
- Okay.

494
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,870
- Wolfie!
- Yeah, sweetheart?

495
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,186
- Lorenzo: Who was the guy in the car?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

496
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,825
- Hey, ally.
- How's it goin'?

497
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,244
- Happy birthday.
- Hey, "happy birthday"?

498
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,787
- Yeah.
- It's not my birthday.

499
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,000
What do you mean?

500
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,402
- Come on.
- No, I was just saying, like...

501
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,042
What the hell happened in here? My god!

502
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,429
- This place is a mess!
- Wolfie: Starting gate is shipazo gito

503
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,243
- and bad beat is wario peito.
- What's going on?

504
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,302
You leave the butter out.

505
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,638
Who the hell's betting on horses

506
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,765
- at breakfast time in Japan?
“Wolfie: It's not

507
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,000
- breakfast time in Japan.
- Matty: They're loading!

508
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,335
- Joe, we're going. Come on!
- Ally: You guys are crazy!

509
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,420
Wolfie: Have a sizable investment
on this thing here.

510
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,309
What did I say about smoking
in this house?

511
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,978
Lorenzo: Outside!
Wolfie: Who are you?

512
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,176
- Lorenzo: Who am 1? It's my house.
- I know it's your house.

513
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
But you smoke too.

514
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,803
- All right, forget it.
- Ally: Okay, good.

515
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,692
Sweetheart, you're happy here,
aren't you?

516
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,657
I'm happy, dad.

517
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,197
I'm just saying, she's got no space.

518
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:13,770
- Matty: What are you saying?
- Wait a minute, sweetheart.

519
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:14,854
Little feet: I'm saying
she's got no space.

520
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,836
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want my friends to look at you.

521
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,667
Take a good look.

522
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,504
With a voice like from heaven,
but you know what?

523
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,672
It's not always the best singers
that make it.

524
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,346
You know?
I knew a couple of guys,

525
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,183
could sing Sinatra under the table.

526
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,814
But frank, he'd come on stage
with the blue eyes,

527
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,692
the sharkskin suit,
the patent leather shoes...

528
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,061
He becomes frank Sinatra.

529
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,942
And everybody else, all these other guys

530
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,533
that really got it,
that really have it inside...

531
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,747
Just a bunch of nobodies.

532
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,501
Okay. Everybody, let's go.

533
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,588
Time for work.

534
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,664
- (Tones playing on headphones)
- (High-pitched ringing)

535
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,679
(Inaudible)

536
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,163
Doctor: Unfortunately,
if you keep blasting the hearing,

537
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,472
it's not gonna come back.

538
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,183
I think it's time we reconsider

539
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,514
- the inner monitors.
- Mmm-hmm.

540
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,752
We talked about that with Bobby

541
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,496
- a couple of weeks ago.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

542
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,688
If we put the inner moles in,
we can actually use those

543
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,445
to amplify the high frequencies.

544
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,093
- Yeah, okay, that sounds great.
- Cut down the sound.

545
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,678
- Yeah, you're right. Yeah.
- I'm gonna talk to Bobby

546
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,805
- and we're gonna get something set up.
- Sold. I'm sold.

547
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,740
- All right, Jack.
- Yeah, call Bobby.

548
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,742
Stubborn son of a gun.

549
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,414
Jack: All right, let's get ready.
1,234.

550
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,492
(Country music playing)

551
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:50,971
(Singing) Killing me, baby,
with the things you do

552
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,267
you put me in the ground

553
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:56,472
we'll try it again.

554
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,971
You gotta put 'em in, man.

555
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,088
I told you, I can't wear those things.

556
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,506
When I wear 'em, it's just in my head,

557
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,170
and I need to be here
with everybody else.

558
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,612
The doctor said it's the only way
to manage this thing, Jack.

559
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,410
You're not gonna get back what you lost.

560
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,946
It's the only way we can manage
what you still got.

561
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,534
Oh, wow.

562
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,041
(Scoffs) I think
we're managing pretty good.

563
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,123
Bobby: What do you want me to do?

564
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,217
The door's wide open if you wanna go.
You know what? Don't start that shit.

565
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,136
Show a little fucking pride
in what you're doing, buddy.

566
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,514
I just wanna know
if she's on her way or not, that's all.

567
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,644
Who's coming?

568
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,393
What the fuck?

569
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,983
- Who's here?
- I have no idea.

570
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,519
- He won't tell me.
- (Ally grunts)

571
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,649
(Operatic music playing)

572
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,026
- Phil: Hi, ally.
- Hi.

573
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,887
- I'm Phil. We met last night.
- Yeah, I remember.

574
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,993
Jack sent me to pick you up
and take you to the gig.

575
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,866
Oh, my god. Um...

576
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,656
But I gotta work. I can't go.

577
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,145
He's really looking forward to this.

578
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,705
I appreciate that, but, uh...

579
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,462
I can't leave, so I'll be in my car
right down the street.

580
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,652
Please tell him,
"thank you, but no thank you."

581
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:08,796
Okay? Say it just like that.

582
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,447
- Wait a minute, ally. What're you doing?
- The fuck is that shit?

583
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,907
- This is crazy.
- What are you doing?

584
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,117
- This is great.
- What the hell's going on?

585
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:17,053
Look, a guy like that invites you
to a show...

586
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,205
- It could be a great opportunity.
- Dad, don't start with me.

587
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,469
- Don't start!
- Listen, listen!

588
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,306
Does he know you sing at all?
Did he hear anything from you?

589
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,483
Dad, I gotta go to work.

590
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,711
This could be the opportunity
of a lifetime.

591
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,895
I don't have the same disease

592
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,714
that you have, dad.
You get around celebrities

593
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,799
and it's like
they're gonna rub off on you.

594
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:30,903
What are you talking about?

595
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,009
What are you talking about?

596
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,633
"Oh, you know
who I drove the other day?"

597
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,139
- Why are you talking about that?
- Like magic, now you're famous.

598
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,654
- And you're not. It's not magic, dad.
- Sweetheart.

599
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,073
He's a drunk! You know all about drunks.

600
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,285
(Door slams)

601
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,672
Sweetheart, he's still there.

602
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,135
Yo, so you fucking hit a cop?

603
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,012
Yeah, he was being an asshole to Jack,

604
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,424
so I fucking popped him in the face.

605
00:32:58,602 --> 00:32:59,637
Yo, that is so gangster.

606
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,331
So, then we ended up in a parking lot,

607
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,291
and he was putting peas
around my hand to fix my hand.

608
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,055
And then he was singing,
and I was singing.

609
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,419
I don't know what the hell's going on.

610
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,399
But now he's got
his driver following me around.

611
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,631
Wait, he's been following you
from your house all the way to work?

612
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,425
- Yes. It's crazy!
- You're fucking late again.

613
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,859
I'm what?

614
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,774
I said you're late!

615
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,542
Are we doing this?

616
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,458
(Both laughing)

617
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,840
Ally: Hey, Bryan, I'm out.

618
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,156
- Find somebody else.
- Bryan, I'll be back. I promise.

619
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,920
- Papo, I promise.
- See ya. I won't.

620
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,641
(Ally whoops)

621
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,057
- Did you see Bryan's face?
- Oh, shit!

622
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,934
Hey, great! Let's do this.

623
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,887
Let's go.

624
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,646
Ramon: What are we doing?

625
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,104
Ally: You know, if I didn't know Jack,

626
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,064
I would call you a stalker.

627
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,315
(Ramon laughs)

628
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,442
Phil: Yeah, sorry about that.

629
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,485
Ramon: Yes, man!

630
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,120
(Ramon whooping)

631
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,495
Lay on that couch right now!
I'm gonna take my shoes off.

632
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,876
- Oh, my god!
- This is nice.

633
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,377
How this shit works...

634
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,508
- They just told you no.
- Oh, okay. I'm so sorry.

635
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,881
- Ramon: Oh, shit!
- (Ally laughing)

636
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,961
I could get used to this shit.

637
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,535
You need to date more rock stars,
baby girl, you know what I'm saying?

638
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,674
We're not dating.

639

640
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,647
Hi, ally. I'm Gail.

641
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,479
Ally: Hi. Gail: Hi.

642
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,552
Oh, you guys can leave your bags.
We'll grab 'em in a sec.

643
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:38,736
- Ready?
- Oh. Okay, sure.

644
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,491
- Okay. Yeah.
- Thanks.

645
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,623
Gail: Did you have a good trip?

646
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,745
Yeanh.

647
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,667
(Continues playing country music)

648
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,537
Passes.

649
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:53,715
- Ally: Oh, thank you.
- Put 'em around your necks.

650
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,916
Earplugs. You'll need these,
it's loud up there.

651
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,093
Yeah, I got 'em. We're coming in.

652
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,095
I'm gonna bring you guys
to the side stage.

653
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,601
Ally: Whoa!

654
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,722
Gail: Guys, guys, guys. This way.

655
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,332
- Sorry, wrong way. It's all good.
- I'm so sorry.

656
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,938
- This place is so big. I'm just...
- Gail: Come on this way.

657
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,066
Oh, watch yourself.

658
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,196
You guys good?

659
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,646
(Crowd cheering)

660
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:18,741
Hey, boys.

661
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,279
He's so excited that you're here.

662

(Crowd clapping rhythmically)

664
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:23,588
(Singing) / told my dyin' daddy
that I had to run away

665
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:29,219
looked him in the eye and said,
"there ain't no other way"

666
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:34,311
so, woman, if I tell you
that I love you, be okay

667
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,600
'cause I ain't lyin'

668
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,106
I don't lie

669
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,396
without an alibi

670
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,676
'Cause I ain't lyin'

671
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,380
I don't lie

672
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:13,437
without an alibi

673
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,308
(crowd cheering)

674
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,439
(Clears throat)

675
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,821
Thank you very much.

676
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,070
That was great.

677
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,162
There's a friend of mine,
who came a long way to be here,

678
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,481
and she wrote a great song,
and I'd just like her to sing it.

679
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,370
I think it's pretty fucking good.

680
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,159
- How are you? You made it!
- I'm good. Hil

681
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,577
- it's so good to see you.
- How are you?

682
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,601
You were really good.

683
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,746
Everything all right? The trip was fine?

684
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,913
- Yeah, yeah.
- Phil was all right?

685
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,777
- Didn't bother you at all?
- Gail was so nice.

686
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,472
So, listen, we're gonna sing that song,
all right?

687
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,610
I did an arrangement,
it was kind of not so great,

688
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,255
- but maybe you could just stick with it.
- No, I can't do that.

689
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,007
- I'm sorry. No, Jack, please.
- Yeah, you're coming. Here we go.

690
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,237
It's not funny.

691
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,738
Jack, don't fuck around.

692
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,984
All you gotta do is trust me.

693
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,202
That's all you gotta do.

694
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,741
I'm gonna sing it either way, so...

695
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,843
(Crowd cheering)

696
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,429
- You lost your mind. Okay.
- (Tuning instruments)

697
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,514
- You have to go sing.
- I'm not going out there, no.

698
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,684
(Band playing slow music)

699
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,361
Jack: (Singing)
Tell me something, girl

700
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:58,413
are you happy in this modern world

701
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:02,166
or do you need more

702
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,213
is there something else
you're searching for

703
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:12,514
I'm falling

704
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:19,392
in all the good times
I find myself longing

705
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,474
for change

706
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:28,272
and in the bad times,
I fear myself

707
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,832
Tell me something, boy

708
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,287
(crowd cheering)

709
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,466
Aren't you tired,
trying to fill that void

710
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,171
or do you need more

711
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:58,635
ain't it hard,
keeping it so hardcore

712
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,304
I'm falling

713
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:08,862
in all the good times
I find myself longing

714
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,281
for change

715
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:18,534
and in the bad times,
I fear myself

716
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:23,623
I'm off the deep end
watch as I dive in

717
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:28,085
I'll never meet the ground

718
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:33,220
crash through the surface
where they can't hurt us

719
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:37,803
we're far from the shallow now

720
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,646
in the shallow shallow

721
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,609
in the shallow shallow

722
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:53,273

(Vocalizing)

726
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:23,520
I'm off the deep end
watch as I dive in

727
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,899
I never meet the ground

728
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:33,405
crash through the surface

(music ends) (Crowd cheering)

735
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,388
- Oh, my god! There's so many people.
- Pretty fucking good, man.

736
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:07,601
Pretty fucking good.

737
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,670
Ally: You see, the way
the guitar just started and...

738
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,338
Jack: I thought maybe I'd set it
in the wrong key,

739
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,506
and then the tempo was too fast.

740
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,112
Ally: No, it was so beautiful, and...
Jack: I wasn't sure...

741
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,819
Ramon: Ally, you okay?
Ally: Jack?

742
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,615
(Fans clamoring)

743
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,284
Jack?

744
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,161
You, you, move!

745
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,415
Woman: Isn't that the girl who sang?

746
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,564
- Man: Good concert, man! Good concert.
- Thank you, yeah. Thank you.

747
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,024
- Jackson, I love you, man.
- Thank you.

748
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,460
Hey, Jack. Killed it.

749
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,214
Really? Yeah.

750
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,005
(Rap music playing)
(All cheering)

751
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,185
Hil

752
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:44,728
oh, my god!

753
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,682
Where's my key? I don't fucking...

754
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,102
Ah, ha, ha, hal

755
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,896
oh, fuck!

756
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,485
(Jack laughing)

757
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,671
I'll be right back, okay?
Just give me one second.

758
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,877
Is this the bathroom?
Where's the fucking...

759
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,597
Okay.

760
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,609
(Chuckles)

761
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,460
Hey.

762
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,787
Jack?

763
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,580
I don't know, wake him up.

764
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,749
- I can't wake him up. He's drunk.
- Yes, you can!

765
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:01,044
Shake your titties in his face
or some shit, and just fucking...

766
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,950
You know what I'm saying?
Take two shots and...

767
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,306
Thank you so much for your help.
You are so helpful.

768
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,216
Let me know how it goes, baby.

769
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,517
(Door closes)

770
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,684
Come on, pal.

771
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,239
He's out.

772
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,578
You think maybe he drinks a bit much?

773
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,539
Sweetie, you have no idea.

774
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,507
Tell you one thing, though.

775
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,385
He's never brought a girl
onstage before.

776
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:49,225
And it's been a long, long time
since he played like that.

777
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,723
Well, that's good to know.

778
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,451
One time, my brother came home,

779
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,497
I was playing on this upright
we used to always have in our den.

780
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,506
And I was in my own world.

781
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,238
No one was ever home,
and then he comes home

782
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,093
to take care of my dad, who was sick.

783
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,009
And he's sittin' there,
and he's looking at me.

784
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,474
I swear to god, he looked at me
like I was special or something,

785
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,310
and it just kind of filled me up.

786
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,563
I should've never told you...
I don't know.

787
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,733
Why?

788
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,349
- 'Cause it's embarrassing. I don't know.
- It's so sweet.

789
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,924
'Cause you're nothing like my brother,
let me just say.

790
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:27,566
- Yeah, I don't look like your brother?
- (Laughs) He's a fucking old man, okay.

791
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,451
My dad had me when he was 63 years old.

792
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,861
Sixty-three years old?

793
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,870
And we have different mothers, so...

794
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,494
(Singing)

795
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,325
Wolfie: What's that number down here?

796
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,833
Matty: That is how many people
looked at it.

797
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:45,000
Get the fuck out of here. How do
they know how many people looked at it?

798
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,543
I think it's...
They call it an "algorithm," or...

799
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,053
What's an algorithm?

800
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,588
- It's like a...
- A beat.

801
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,132
"A beat"? Yeah. Yeah.

802
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,801
- Like in music, a beat?
- Yeah.

803
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,721
Yeah, yeah. I think, I don't know.

804
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,519
- Do you believe this?
- No. (Laughs)

805
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,894
- Matty: Wow.
- And you see this?

806
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,883
- Wolfie: Yeah.
- That's how many people have watched.

807
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,218
Wolfie: Yeah, yeah
we're just telling...

808
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,678
- They was telling him.
- How the fuck do they do that?

809
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:11,488
Lorenzo: I've watched it
200 times myself.

810
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:15,071
- I'm 200 of those people.
- Go, pops.

811
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,997
(Music playing)

812
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:21,623
(Laughing) Oh, jeez!
My god, you're so fast! Jack!

813
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,503
Jack: French toast is gonna come out.

814
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,001
(Ally laughing)

815
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,469
First one to hit the bed.

816
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,061
Lorenzo: Beautiful!
You wrote this with him?

817
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,560
Ally: He's so talented.

818
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:46,965
Can I watch it again?
Just one more time.

819
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,467
Lorenzo: Yeah, it's good. One more time.

820
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,851
- I'll be up all night watching this.
Ally: Or 500. Come on!

821
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,571
Christ!

822
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,865
(Music continues playing)

823
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,468
Oh, my god.

824
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,596
How did you get in here?

825
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,393
Your dad let me in.

826
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,692
What?

827
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,329
Ally: I don't feel this way
about everybody.

828
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,293
Well, good.

829
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,830
Then we're on the same page.
You come and sing with me.

830
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,135
Where?

831
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,465
Well, first stop's Arizona.

832
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,468
(Shower running)

833
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,331
Ally: I'm never getting
on that thing with you

834
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,395
when you've been drinking.

835
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,014
I haven't even thought about drinking
or anything else.

836
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,651
We'll see how long that lasts.
Go wait downstairs.

837
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,983
Actually, when I was in my 20s
and 30s, I was like a crooner.

838
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,994
As a matter of fact,
a lot of people thought I was

839
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,574
better than Sinatra.

840
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,160
- (Friends laughing)
- Frank? Frank Sinatra?

841
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,621
What are you writing down in here?

842
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:37,054
That's my songbook.
I usually use a typewriter, but...

843
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,636
I had this idea on the bike,

844
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,634
and I didn't wanna forget it.

845
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,748
- How do you hear it?
- (Singing melody)

846
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,194
(Singing) I'm alone in my house

847
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:00,994
aren't you excited to be home,
and play for all your arizonian fans?

848
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,746
I don't really come back here.

849
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,873
You avoid your home?

850
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,960
I don't know.

851
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,994
It's like the hot air and the...

852
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,088
History, I don't know.

853
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,430
Bought the ranch, though, I grew up on,
gave it to my brother.

854
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,537
We buried dad there,
and so I just wanted to make sure

855
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,803
that nobody paved over his grave

856
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,306
- or any of that kind of shit.
- Is it around here?

857
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:29,769
It's not far.

858
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,185
Why don't we just go there? It's nearby.

859
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,240
(Wind howling)

860
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,244
Ally: Jack?

861
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,462
Yeah, if he shows up.

862
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:59,237
These guys have been vamping out there
for a fucking half an hour.

863
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,381
It's time to fucking get on.

864
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,799
Don't you get tired of being...

865
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,220
You sold dad's ranch!

866
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,898
They turned it into a fucking wind farm!

867
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,607
I bought that for you.

868
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,530
Where's his grave?

869
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,282
He washed away in a fucking storm.

870
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,742
His grave isn't there anymore.

871
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,701
Fuck, I told you,
but you were fucking drunk.

872
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,744
You were fucking loaded

873
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,710
and already pissing yourself
a swan song.

874
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,260
Fuck, you shed a tear
for that piece of shit

875
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,423
you idolize for
no goddamn fucking reason.

876
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,436
All dad ever did for you

877
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,432
was make you his fucking drinking buddy.

878
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,298
And you'd be right there with him
if he was still alive,

879
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:58,404
and you fucking know it.

880
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,696
What did you think?

881
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,327
That I was gonna fucking
take care of it

882
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:10,074
while I'm fucking cradling your ass
all over the goddamn world?

883
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,342
Jack: Yeah.

884
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,002
That's a good excuse.

885
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,215
Raising a little brother

886
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:25,301
so you don't have to deal with the fact
that you were no fucking good.

887
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,594
If I was no good,
why'd you steal my fucking voice?

888
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,273
Huh?

889
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:34,394
'Cause you had nothing to fucking say.

890
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,489
You were too proud to sing
any of the songs I ever wrote.

891
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,528
Well, I got something to say now, pal.

892
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,288
I'm done being your fucking errand boy.

893
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,042
I quit.

894
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,920
Jack: Yeah, my voice just got up on me
a few months ago

895
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:07,507
and another shot of steroids
is better safe than sorry.

896
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,261
Thank you for that,
and yeah, we should be good.

897
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,645
(Spits)

898
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:27,995
Hey.

899
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,367
You okay?

900
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:32,959
Yeanh.

901
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,744
Well, let's play.

902
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,249
(Crowd cheering)

903
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:42,962
Oh!

904
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,044
(Band playing country music)

905
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,833
Jack: (Singing)
Don't ask me 'bout tomorrow

906
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,205
or tell me 'bout my past

907
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:23,465
my heart is yours to borrow
ain't nothing meant to last

908
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,125
[ain't lyin'

909
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,894
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die

910
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,390
(crowd cheering)

911
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:41,100
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die

912
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,320
it takes a lot to change a man
hell, it takes a lot to try

913
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:53,450
maybe it's time to let the old ways die

914
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:59,831
nobody knows what waits for the dead

915
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,965
nobody knows what waits for the dead

916
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,595
some folks just believe
in the things they've heard

917
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:12,677
and the things they've read

918
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:17,102
nobody knows what waits for the dead

919
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:23,689
I'm glad I can't go back
to where I came from

920
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:29,652
I'm glad those days are gone
gone for good

921
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,239
but if I could take spirits
from my past and bring 'em here

922
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,078
you know I would

923
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,168
you know I would

924
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,087
(crowd cheering)

925
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,801
All right, I got an idea for the end.

926
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,115
- Man: Sorry...
- That's okay.

927
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,325
It's gonna be a little different,
we're gonna...

928
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,149
Ally: Cheers.
Man: Cheers. Where's that joint?

929
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:56,466
We're just gonna be a little different
for the end, okay?

930
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,311
We're gonna do the encore
and the thing that I said.

931
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,416
Man: Okay. All right.
Jack: All right?

932
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,960
- Come on, let's go back out and do it.
Ally: What?

933
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,190
What are you doing?

934
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,896
Jack: Go, go, go.

935
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,773
(Crowd cheering)
(Rhythmic clapping)

936
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,196
All right, listen to me.
Here's what we're gonna do.

937
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,594
You're gonna do the song that I said
that I wanted you to do, remember?

938
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,653
The one that I love.

939
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,805
No. No, I'm not. Please! Come on.

940
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:14,931
No, you're gonna do the one that I love.

941
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,182
- It's gonna be great, come on.
- Come on, Jack.

942
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,350
This is what I said I always...

943
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,018
- You promised me you were gonna do it.
- I always say...

944
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,452
I love you.

945
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,577
Always remember us this way.

946
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,719
Everybody, we're gonna bring out ally
to bring us home,

947
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,132
and she's gonna sing an original song.

948
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,716
Thank you.

949
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:45,816
(Singing) That Arizona sky

950
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,153
burning in your eyes

951
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:57,115
you look at me, and, babe,
I wanna catch on fire

952
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,073
it's buried in my soul

953
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,622
like California gold

954
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:11,592
you found the light in me
that I couldn't find

955
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:19,175
so when I'm all choked up
and I can't find the words

956
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:26,269
every time we say goodbye
baby, it hurts

957
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:35,533
when the sun goes down
and the band won't play

958
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:41,205
I'll always remember us this way

959
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,159
lovers in the night

960
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,916
poets tryin' to write

961
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:55,882
we don't know how fo rhyme
but damn we try

962
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:00,516
but all I really know

963
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,389
you're where I wanna go

964
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:10,647
the part of me that's you will never die

965
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:18,068
so when I'm all choked up
and I can't find the words

966
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:25,412
every time we say goodbye
baby, it hurts

967
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:31,417
when the sun goes down

968
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,841
and the band won't play

969
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:39,927
I'll always remember us this way

970
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,174
oh, yeah

971
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:46,770
I don't wanna be just a memory
baby, yeah

972
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,889
(vocalizing)

973
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:06,373
So when I'm all choked up
and I can't find the words

974
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:13,331
every time we say goodbye
baby, it hurts

975
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:21,923
when the sun goes down
and the band won't play

976
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:28,429
I'll always remember us this way

977
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,017
way, yeah

978
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:33,650
when you look at me

979
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,438
and the whole world fades

980
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:42,739
I'll always remember us

981
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:49,116
this way

982
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:52,289
(vocalizing)

983
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,012
(Music ends) (Crowd cheering)

984
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:08,185
Crowd: (Chanting)
Ally! Ally! Ally! Ally!

985
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,069
- That was fucking beautiful.
- (Laughys)

986
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,240
Jack: No, you were fucking doing it.
I was there, I fucking...

987
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,947
- I think our car's over there.
- Ally, that was unbelievable.

988
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,724
- Thank you.
- That was unbelievable

989
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,454
- what you did up there.
- Thank you.

990
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,617
I don't know if you know anything
about me, about where I've come from.

991
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:33,410
I'm rez gavron.

992
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:35,625
I know who you are.

993
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:41,176
What you have right now
goes way beyond just this.

994
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,591
There's people who need to hear
what you have to say musically.

995
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,634
This is not normal stuff.

996
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,178
It's really amazing what you're doing.

997
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,642
I think you have it all. I do.

998
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,577
And the question to you is,
what do you want?

999
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:00,487
I'm in that position,
to put you wherever you want to be.

1000
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,774
I don't... I don't have...

1001
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,953
I gotta talk to Jack. (Chuckles)

1002
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:12,742
He said he thought interscope records
might really wanna sign me,

1003
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,626
and he said that he has
this wonderful studio

1004
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,583
with a beautiful live room,

1005
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,748
and these amazing producers
he wants to bring in

1006
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,292
to record my songs.

1007
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,210
And he loves "look what I've found.”

1008
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,471
Remember the song we did in the diner?

1009
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:29,098
- Remember, when we were driving?
- Yeah.

1010
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,305
Yeah?

1011
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:35,848
I mean, it was so nice talking to him,
and he really believes in me.

1012
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,607
(Ally gasps)

1013
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,694
- Man: You all right, Jack?
- He's okay. He's fine.

1014
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:41,319
He does this all the time.

1015
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,322
Hey, Jack.

1016
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:50,456
Thanks.

1017
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,699
What's going on?

1018
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,126
Hmm?

1019
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,662
What're you doing?

1020
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:04,925
(Ally gasps)

1021
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,553
You jealous fuck.

1022
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,603
I'm so happy for you.

1023
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,810
(Chuckles) Oh, you are?

1024
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,813
Oh! Jackson! (Gasps)

1025
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,360
(Laughing) Oh, my god!

1026
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,699
Jack. Stop!

1027
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,954
Why're you so jealous, boy? Hmm?

1028
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,325
What're you doing?

1029
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,078
What's wrong? You upset?

1030
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,210
You want me to make you less...

1031
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,875
I know, do you wanna play?
Okay, let's play.

1032
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,011
(Crashing)

1033
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,881
What the hell is this?

1034
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,871
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, you're fine. You're all fine.

1035
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,806
- You sound great, okay?
- You were great.

1036
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,270
We'll do it again. I'm gonna cue you in.

1037
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,602
(Music playing)

1038
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:03,310
- One, two...
- (Singing) I'm alone in my house

1039
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,132
Ben: One second, one second.
Listen to my cue.

1040
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,271
We'll come right in, okay?

1041
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,698
Ally: So, should... well, uh...

1042
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:11,735
I'm sorry,
but will I sing in the beginning?

1043
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,349
Ben: So you're gonna hear
the second line,

1044
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,988
and then I'm gonna start recording.

1045
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,245
I think I got an idea
that might help out, all right?

1046
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,044
Yeah, please. Be my guest.

1047
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:21,232
Ben: That was really good
up to that point.

1048
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,942
Jack: I'm just gonna go in there
for a second, all right?

1049
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:23,966
Ben: All right, Jack.

1050
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,654
I've never sang with a track before.

1051
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,339
I think it's because
you need your piano.

1052
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,157
I think if you're playing it
and singing it...

1053
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,326
Yeah, I always play it on the piano.
And that's, I'll be fine.

1054
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,662
I'm just gonna have them fly one in,
and we'll try it there

1055
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,768
- and see where it goes.
- You think that's okay?

1056
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,892
- Okay. Thank you.
- I got you. You're doing great.

1057
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,556
- You okay?
- No, I'm so nervous.

1058
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,976
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

1059
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:45,988
Thank you.

1060
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,399
(Playing upbeat music)

1061
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,286
(Singing) I'm alone in my house

1062
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,128
I'm out on the town

1063
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:14,140
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I've been knocking 'em down

1064
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,394
I can't get back up on my feet

1065
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:26,106
see the lights on the street
like stars

1066
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:28,524
but look what I found

1067
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,315
oh, so you guys have already
met the new girl, have you?

1068
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:34,443
- Rez! What's the plan?
- What's up?

1069
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:36,657
Yo, thanks for doing this, man.
I appreciate it.

1070
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:39,573
This is pop music, kids.
We have a battle to do, okay?

1071
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:41,787
You are the troops,
so if I call you troops,

1072
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,043
just know that we're going into battle.

1073
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,329
What is my lyrics, ally?

1074
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:47,122
(Singing) Just don't keep me waiting

1075
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,923
yes! Again, give me that.

1076
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:51,506
When I can't inspire myself

1077
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:53,135
breathe! Yes!

1078
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,088
I need you to provide for me

1079
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:58,224
this is just fine-tuning
and creating an image.

1080
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:03,014
I know, I just don't wanna lose
the part of me that's talented.

1081
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,794
- You know?
- I'm not gonna let you lose that piece.

1082
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,337
I'm not gonna let you lose that piece.

1083
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,567
(Sighs) Okay.

1084
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,615
What are we gonna do with you?

1085
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,742
What are we gonna do with...
Oh, he's beautiful!

1086
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,140
"You can't send me back. I'm too cute."

1087
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,405
- Hey, he's got your eyelashes.
- Mmm-hmm.

1088
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,162
He does. He's got your eyelashes.
Hey, bud!

1089
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,287
This has never been done before,
just so you know.

1090
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,672
It actually has been done before.

1091
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,333
Would you please... (Laughing)

1092
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,419
Please. Do it for me.

1093
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,812
(Playing melancholy music)

1094
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,415
(Sighs)

1095
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,910
You comin' with me to Memphis?

1096
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:13,049
- What are you talkin' about?
- I gotta go do this, um...

1097
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,211
You know, it's one of those paid things.

1098
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:19,221
Soul-crushing work, really,

1099
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,929
but it's just kind of never
what I thought I'd wind up doing.

1100
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,968
Maybe. I don't know, but...

1101
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,017
I've made peace with it, though.

1102
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,067
Anyway, if you wanna come, I thought

1103
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,773
we'd have a laugh, at the very least.

1104
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:37,441
Rez wants to keep me here because,
you know, they rushed out the single,

1105
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:40,656
and they were so excited
that they want me to finish the album.

1106
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:44,038
- So I'm working on that.
- Listen to what you're saying.

1107
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,370
Listen to what you just said.

1108
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,148
- People wanna hear what you have to say.
- I know.

1109
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,958
- That's the stuff right there.
- I can't...

1110
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,919
Hey, hey. Take it in.

1111
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,301
Thank you, by the way.

1112
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:58,507
Thank you for what?

1113
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,046
Giving me a home.

1114
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,640
This place never felt like one before.

1115
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,059
(Indistinct chatter)

1116
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,153
(Snorting)

1117
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,789
(High-pitched ringing)

1118
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,926
(Crowd cheering)
(Ringing continues)

1119
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:41,838
Oh, fuck.

1120
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:44,382
Band member: (Muffled) Jack, you okay?

1121
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,885
Jack?

1122
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,145
(Crowd cheering)

1123
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:51,939
(Music playing)

1124
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:05,199
(Singing) Treat me like your patient

1125
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:08,035
just don't keep me waiting

1126
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:12,919
or I'll just be wasted
in a crowd of the lonely

1127
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:16,130
I need you to inspire me

1128
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:19,008
when I can't inspire myself

1129
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:21,635
I need you to provide for me

1130
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,967
is there a reason
why you're not up there?

1131
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:27,263
Lay me down lay me down now

1132
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,144
lay me down touch my spirit, oh

1133
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:32,931
lay me down lay me down now

1134
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,815
lay me down

1135
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:37,352
heal me

1136
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:42,900
god knows nothing else is gonna
gonna heal me

1137
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:48,117
oh, before it's too late
won't you steal me

1138
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:53,168
steal me all the way from myself
won't you heal me

1139
01:08:53,338 --> 01:08:56,080
oh, my god! Oh, my god!

1140
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,213
Oh, my... oh, my... hey!

1141
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,124
- Pretty incredible.
- Did Jack show up?

1142
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,338
I haven't heard from him.

1143
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,656
What do you mean,
you haven't heard from him?

1144
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,658
- I haven't heard from him all night.
- I haven't been able to find him.

1145
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,047
I called him three times.

1146
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,985
Listen, what happened
with the dancers there?

1147
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,975
Well, I just thought
that I should do it alone

1148
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,807
'cause it's so overwhelming.

1149
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,517
Okay, but you can't go rogue on me.

1150
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,228
You have to understand
that this is what I do

1151
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:17,938
and you have to trust me, okay?

1152
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,852
So, if I give you a couple of dancers,

1153
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:23,774
don't not use them
and then miss a couple of steps, okay?

1154
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,985
We also have to change your hair.

1155
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,474
We have to change
the color of your hair.

1156
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:29,954
What's wrong with my hair?

1157
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:33,116
- I'm thinking platinum, or...
- I don't wanna be fucking blond.

1158
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:36,828
I am who I am,
and I'm worried about Jack.

1159
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,755
I will find Jack, okay?

1160
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:41,211
I will find him.

1161
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,340
Jack.

1162
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:51,593
I feel like we've done this before.

1163
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:56,605
Didn't think we'd do it so soon, man.
Come on, bro. Get up.

1164
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,819
- (Jack coughs)
- All right. There we go.

1165
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,654
(Jack exhales)

1166
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,278
Jack: In my mind, (laughing)
I'd made it to the door.

1167
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,818
George: [ Almost didn't wake you.
You looked so comfortable.

1168
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:11,822
How you doin'?

1169
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,661
You know, I've seen better days,
I guess.

1170
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,039
I apologize for

1171
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,442
- disrespecting your property...
- No apologies necessary.

1172
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,797
Or whatever I did.

1173
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,288
It's fine. You want some coffee?

1174
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:25,989
Be great, why don't you put some on,
and we'll come in in a minute?

1175
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,253
Paulette: Okay.

1176
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,966
Jack: That's him, right?
That's your boy.

1177
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:34,223
Jack, he's as old now

1178
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,230
- as you were when I met you.
- (Jack laughs)

1179
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,521
Saw you on YouTube.

1180
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:43,687
- That video with the girl.
- (Sniffles) Yeah.

1181
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:49,484
It made me happy, man.
You looked like you.

1182
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,869
You were just doing it, bro.

1183
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,285
Jack: She writes too.

1184
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,538
- She wrote that tune?
- Yeah.

1185
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,544
Bunch of others too.

1186
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:06,009
Got hooked up with some manager guy,
he wants to...

1187
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,255
(Coughing)

1188
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:11,513
Yeanh.

1189
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,051
- She's good, bro.
- I know.

1190
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:19,097
Maybe she's a way out.

1191
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,647
Ain't nothing to be afraid of, bro.

1192
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,529
You know, it's like...

1193
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:35,576
I don't know... you float out,

1194
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:41,252
float out at sea, and then one day,
you find a port.

1195
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:44,168
Say, "I'm gonna stay here
for a few days."

1196
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:46,549
A few days becomes a few years.

1197
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,553
And then you forgot where you were goin'
in the first place.

1198
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,508
And then you realize, you don't really
give a shit about where you was going

1199
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:57,426
'cause you like where you're at.

1200
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,396
That's how it is for me.

1201
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:02,731
I like where I'm at.

1202
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,561
I didn't even realize
I liked it so much

1203
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,526
till I saw your ass
sleeping in the grass this morning.

1204
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:11,733
(Both laughing)

1205
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,993
Yeah, come on, man.
You can rest in my daughter's room, bro.

1206
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:27,165
I thought of a million things
to say to you on the plane

1207
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,379
that I can't remember.

1208
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,007
Jack...

1209
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,630
Glad you're here.

1210
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,597
You did make it to Memphis after all.

1211
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:39,848
(Jack coughs)

1212
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,396
(Jack groans)

1213
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:44,561
Fuck.

1214
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:47,398
Ally: I won't do this again.

1215
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,776
I won't come and find you.

1216
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,743
Next time, you can clean up
your own mess.

1217
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,488
You understand me?

1218
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,458
How was the show?

1219
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,879
- It was fucking awesome.
- (Laughs)

1220
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,711
I cut the dancers.

1221
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,136
Dancers?

1222
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,220
Yeanh.

1223
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,340
Oh.

1224
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,592
Good.

1225
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,800
Fucking dancers.

1226
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,886
All you do is you just sing.

1227
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,349
You made me so upset.

1228
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,139
I'm sorry.

1229
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:28,525
- I saw that video on YouTube.
- Oh!

1230
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:29,613
It was great.

1231
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,817
Thank you so much.

1232
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,078
Excuse me one second.

1233
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,955
- What's going on?
- Do you have a plier?

1234
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,084
Paulette: Jack's okay?

1235
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,956
I wanna cut the guitar strings,
not too crazy.

1236
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,872
I know there used to be pliers
or something like that.

1237
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:51,207
Uh... yeah, yeah.

1238
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:52,921
Ally: I don't know where my mom is.

1239
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:55,799
- Yeah. I understand that.
- Leo: I think you're pretty.

1240
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,015
Me?

1241
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:59,382
You think I'm pretty?

1242
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:02,017
Thank you. I think you're pretty.

1243
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:06,013
George: It was real great, and then
Jack tells me you wrote the song.

1244
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:09,025
Ally: Yeah, he got me to start singing
my own songs again.

1245
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,103
George: He has a way of doing that.

1246
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,396
Ally: Yeah, he does.

1247
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:15,530
Does anyone want
some more Mac and cheese?

1248
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,238
Yeah? Here, sweetheart,
you want some?

1249
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:22,747
Oh, there he goes.
What's up, man?

1250
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,953
(Whispers) I understand what you said.

1251
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,407
What the hell are you... (Gasps)

1252
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,762
(Ally laughs in disbelief)

1253
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:43,853
Are you kidding?

1254
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:46,433
- Is that stupid?
- No. It's not stupid.

1255
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:48,355
Jack: It wasn't a stupid thing
I just did?

1256
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:50,462
Is that what you were doing
when you left the table?

1257
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,273
I don't know. He told me
he was looking for some pliers.

1258
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:54,841
I didn't know what he was going to do.

1259
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,505
I didn't think
he was gonna "do it" do it.

1260
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:59,359
Oh, she has another ring!

1261
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:00,993
Well, that's just temporary.

1262
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,905
No, no, no. Jack, wait a minute.

1263
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,287
Let's anoint this. Let's do it today.

1264
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:09,118
(Laughing)

1265
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:10,649
- Yo, for real.
- Paulette: It's a good ideal

1266
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:11,873
George: No, you get the dress.

1267
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,547
I'll call my cousin right now.

1268
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,674
It's Saturday.
Nobody's gonna be in there.

1269
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:17,801
- Let's go.
- You really wanna do that?

1270
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:20,338
That place has a magical quality to it.

1271
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,677
It what? It has a magical quality?

1272
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,433
- It does.
- What do you mean?

1273
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:26,498
- I mean that church is special.
- Paulette: We can go.

1274
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,934
- I'll take you to get a dress.
- There you go, right there.

1275
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:30,393
Paulette: It'd be great!

1276
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:33,100
Okay, you're coming with us
for sure because you're...

1277
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:37,318
I can't believe this.
What am I doing? Okay, sure.

1278
01:15:37,742 --> 01:15:39,573
(Romantic music playing)

1279
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:50,701
- My brother. Good to see you.
- Hey, hey!

1280
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,880
- Good to see you. Jack!
- Good to see you, my man.

1281
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,421
(Laughing)

1282
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,588
Thank you so much.

1283
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,880
Welcome to the lord's house.

1284
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,448
With the power... I think that's
how it goes, something like that.

1285
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,838
Do you take him...
Do you take him?

1286
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,006
I do.

1287
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:06,884
I do.

1288
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,941
Congrats, man.

1289
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:17,896
- I listened to what you said.
- I'm glad you did.

1290
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:19,735
Pastor: I can't believe he did it.

1291
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,149
I can't believe it.

1292
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,859
Now, one thing at a time, okay?

1293
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,569
- What?
- (Laughing)

1294
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,951
Oh! (Stammering) I didn't understand.

1295
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,034
(Romantic music continues playing)

1296
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,195
(Sighs deeply)

1297
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,237
- Jack: Lot of people downstairs?
- Yeah.

1298
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,726
She better come out soon,
before they leave.

1299
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,865
Want me to check on her?

1300
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,830
Well, I think we're gonna have
to go pretty soon, so...

1301
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:15,581
All right.

1302
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,209
Ally.

1303
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,546
I'm coming in.

1304
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,844
What're you doin' in the tub?

1305
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:32,599
This is so weird.

1306
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:35,810
I don't know who the hell I think I am.

1307
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:38,442
One song is fine,

1308
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:39,798
but to put out a whole record,

1309
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:41,983
I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

1310
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:46,025
I don't know about all of that,
but you definitely look like a star.

1311
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,073
Really? Yeah.

1312
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:52,869
What do you think of
her hair and the look and the...

1313
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,479
Rez: Well, I discussed it with her.
Yeah.

1314
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,398
- No, I think it looks great.
- Was that your choice, or...

1315
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:57,787
No, it was actually hers.

1316
01:17:58,716 --> 01:17:59,751
(Sighs)

1317
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:02,166
No drink? What's that?

1318
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,379
No drink?

1319
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,923
- No socks?
- (Laughs)

1320
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,721
Touché. Touché, mate.

1321
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:15,388
Yeah, I could never get used to that,
the idea of not wearing socks.

1322
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,978
- Your feet get all...
- No, actually I'm wearing socks.

1323
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:23,675
- That work with these shoes.
- Oh, you are. You're just hiding them.

1324
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,190
Yeah, I'm just hiding them.
(Laughs) That's right.

1325
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,279
Okay, now is this thing...
Yeah, there it is.

1326
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,615
Ooh, that's a good light.
Here, hold this for me, baby.

1327
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:32,529
Hey, ally, girl!

1328
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,074
Wait, hold on.
Come here, sooki, Donte. Come here.

1329
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,788
I put my Jackson titties on!

1330
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,077
All: Hi!

1331
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,292
Baby, listen, we just wanted
to say congratulations.

1332
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:42,747
- Congratulations!
- We love you!

1333
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:43,843
I love you too.

1334
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:45,280
Emcee: All right, girl,
please come back soon.

1335
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:48,216
- We done put etta in your station, girl.
- (Laughter)

1336
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,340
Rez: The queen is here!
Ally: Stop!

1337
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:53,467
- Wow!
- What do you think?

1338
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:54,893
Well, it's beautiful.

1339
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:58,852
You. Snl. Alec Baldwin hosting.

1340
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:00,879
- Did you get it? Did you get it?
- Season finale.

1341
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,214
- No fucking way.
- Rez: No, you got it.

1342
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:03,774
- No way! Oh, my god!
- No, you got it.

1343
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,779
Oh, my gosh!

1344
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,941
- That's incredible! Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1345
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:10,859
- Congratulations.
- Bitch!

1346
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,308
- Oh, my gosh!
- We have to get downstairs.

1347
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:14,768
- Everyone's waiting for you. Come.
- Okay.

1348
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,770
Jack: You know what, can I just talk
to her for one second outside?

1349
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,955
Just one sec, sorry.
Just be a second, yeah.

1350
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:21,879
(Ally sighs)

1351
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:23,623
(Jack exhales)

1352
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,053
It doesn't do you any justice,
I'll tell you that.

1353
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,844
You always said you liked my nose.

1354
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:35,509
- I love your nose.
- It's real big up there.

1355
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,415
- I wish it was bigger up there.
- (Laughing)

1356
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,725
The whole thing should just be
your fucking nose.

1357
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,559
Fuck all those people
who ever said anything.

1358
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,023
Just put a billboard
of your fucking nose up there.

1359
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:48,655
Just the nose? That's so ridiculous.

1360
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:52,284
Listen, if I just don't say this,
I'll never forgive myself.

1361
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:55,992
What?

1362
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,419
If you don't dig deep
into your fucking soul,

1363
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:05,043
you won't have legs.

1364
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,717
I'm just telling you that.

1365
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:13,506
You don't tell the truth out there,
you're fucked.

1366
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,638
All you got is you,
and what you wanna say to people,

1367
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,082
and they are listening right now,

1368
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:20,458
and they're not gonna be
listening forever.

1369
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,097
Trust me.

1370
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:25,692
So, you gotta grab it.

1371
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:29,071
And you don't apologize, you don't worry
about why they're listening

1372
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:30,844
or how long they're gonna
be listening for,

1373
01:20:30,868 --> 01:20:32,824
you just tell 'em what you wanna say.

1374
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:47,381
'Cause how you say it
is the stuff of angels.

1375
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,631
Richy: Pop! Six to the right, and hot!

1376
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:52,965
Ball, change. Down.

1377
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,381
Hot! Ball, change.

1378
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:59,093
- Attitude.
- (Dancers whooping)

1379
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:00,519
- The last part.
- I know.

1380
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:01,721
(Ally grunts)

1381
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:06,104
- Woman: Thirty seconds.
- (Audience applauding)

1382
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:10,737
Red Mark.

1383
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:12,950
(Clears throat)

1384
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:14,991
Alec in 20.

1385
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:16,660
Man: Fifteen.

1386
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:19,100
Director: All right, stand by, guys.
Here we go, ready? Song one.

1387
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,310
Man: Stand by, Alec.
Director: Stand by, Alec.

1388
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:22,495
Man: In ten, nine...
Woman: Alec in 10.

1389
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,481
- Eight, seven, six...
- Director: Ready 4...

1390
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,545
- (Alec clears throat)
“Woman: Alec in five seconds.

1391
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:30,503
Man: Four, three, two, one...
Director: And go 4. Dissolve 4...

1392
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:32,258
- And cue Alec!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1393
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:34,928
- ally.
- Director: Dissolve 1.

1394
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,006
(Crowd cheering) (Music playing)

1395
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:46,519
(Singing) Why do you
look so good in those jeans

1396
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:51,649
why'd you come around me
with an ass like that

1397
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:54,782
you're making all my thoughts obscene

1398
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:59,412
this is not, not like me

1399
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:03,540

1400
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:07,795
got other things I need my mind on, yeah

1401
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,919
other responsibilities

1402
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:15,761
this is not, not like me

1403
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,468
why did you do that

1404
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:20,007

1405
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,426
why did you do that
do that do that do that

1406
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,094

1407
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,639
why did you do that
do that do that do that

1408
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,148
do that to me

1409
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:30,274
why did you do that

1410
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,232
why did you do that

1411
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:42,245
(Bottles clinking)

1412
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,962
The caterpillar becomes the butterfly.

1413
01:22:56,054 --> 01:22:57,760
What the hell are you doing here?

1414
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,796
I'm in town for a gig.

1415
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,303
Been working for Willie.

1416
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,972
- I've been working for Willie.
- No shit.

1417
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:07,604
Yeah. Thought I'd stop by
and check her out.

1418
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:08,774
Yeah, well...

1419
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:10,019
I've been praying on my knees

1420
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:13,856
that you would always stay around
that you would never leave

1421
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,771
is it gettin' worse?

1422
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:20,489
Nah, I've just been with my wife,
and it's goin' real good.

1423
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:27,957
Funny to run into you, 'cause, uh...

1424
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:34,339
I was thinking about asking you
to come back out with us.

1425
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,091
I gotta say, it's easier without you.

1426
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:49,187
Listen.

1427
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:52,725
You run into any trouble,

1428
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:54,188
call me.

1429
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:57,775
Why did you do that,
do that do that do that

1430
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,906
do that to me

1431
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,906
oh, why did you do that to me

1432
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,415
why did you do that

1433
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:10,913
(crowd cheering)

1434
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:13,631
Thank you!

1435
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,340
(Country music playing)

1436
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,855
Both: (Singing)
I don't wanna feel another thing

1437
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:42,824
I don't wanna feel another thing

1438
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:50,374
I don't wanna feel another thing

1439
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:51,700
(camera clicking)

1440
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:53,275
Photographer: That light's beautiful.

1441
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,082
Oh, god, here we...

1442
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:58,582
Yeah, that's it, ally. Yeah, that's it.

1443
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:02,761
That's it, ally. That's it, I love that.

1444
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,302
Oh, my gosh. It's so early.
I've been here all night.

1445
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:08,913
- It's early for me. It's late for you.
- Hi, it's nice to see you.

1446
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,302
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

1447
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,874
- He's amazing. Isn't he?
- What do you think?

1448
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,934
These fucking photos.

1449
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,566
- Oh, they're so beautiful.
- Look at that! Look at that!

1450
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:17,772
That's incredible.

1451
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,153
It doesn't even look like me.

1452
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:25,655
You've just been nominated
for three grammys.

1453
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,741
Including best new artist.

1454
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,706
They just announced it now.

1455
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:42,918
Everybody, grammy-nominated artist.

1456
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:45,219
(All applauding)

1457
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,958
(Jack sighs)

1458
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,667
Have you been drinking?
Are you fucked up right now?

1459
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,297
I'm out a couple.

1460
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:23,083
It's the morning.

1461
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,046
Yup.

1462
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,425
(Charlie whines softly)

1463
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,220
Hey, buddy.

1464
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,496
(Ally humming softly)

1465
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,129
(Sighs)

1466
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:06,255
You're nominated for three grammys,
and it's fucking great.

1467
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,842
Thank you. How did you find that out?

1468
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,381
Bobby told me.

1469
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:15,390
He called. He said that, uh,

1470
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:19,648
they wanna do some Roy orbison tribute.
They want me to sing and shit.

1471
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,433
- Great.
- Some like supergroup thing.

1472
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:24,102
But the point is, you got nominated,
and it's great.

1473
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,151
I'm just trying to figure it out,
that's all.

1474
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,482
(Jack clears throat)

1475
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:32,306
- What are you trying to figure out?
- "Why do you come around me

1476
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,945
"with an ass like that?"

1477
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,604
What, you're saying my lyrics?
"Why do you walk around in jeans?

1478
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:40,022
"Why do you wanna come around
with an ass like that?"

1479
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,332
Yeah, that's my song.
What about my song?

1480
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:45,465
I fucking listened to it
over and over in the fucking...

1481
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:46,921
(Sighs deeply)

1482
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,505
You're not making any sense.

1483
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,506
Yeah, just keep drinking.

1484
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:55,619
- That'll give you the answer.
- Maybe I just fucking failed you.

1485
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:57,373
- That just kills me. I'm sorry.
- You what?

1486
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:58,432
You failed me?

1487
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:00,479
Yeah, you're embarrassing,
and it's just...

1488
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,311
- I'm embarrassing?
- I feel bad for you.

1489
01:28:02,486 --> 01:28:04,547
- Yeah, I just... you know...
- I'm not fucking embarrassing!

1490
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:05,965
- I just have to tell you.
- You're embarrassing!

1491
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,300
And you know what you're doing is

1492
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:08,926
you're so embarrassed
of your fucking self

1493
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,531
that you gotta put me down.

1494
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:11,763
You're worried that you're ugly,
and you're not.

1495
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:12,889
I'm trying to tell you that.

1496
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:14,098
So you need to get
all this fucking approval

1497
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:15,362
by all these other people.

1498
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:17,727
- Why can't I just be enough for you?
- I don't need approval.

1499
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,479
You know what I'd like
is for my boyfriend to love me.

1500
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,981
- Actually, for my husband to love me.
- Yeah, who's your fucking boyfriend?

1501
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:24,291
- You have a boyfriend?
- Yeah, I've got a boyfriend.

1502
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,081
- That hurts.
- Yeah, I have a boyfriend.

1503
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,488
- Calling me your fucking boyfriend?
- You're my boyfriend.

1504
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:31,595
You're my boyfriend
if you don't treat me like your wife.

1505
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:33,676
I don't even know
what that fucking means.

1506
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:37,183
It means clean your shit up.
You're fucking messy.

1507
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:39,640
- That's what it means.
- Well, that's not true.

1508
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:40,850
- Oh, itisn't?
- Mmm-mmm.

1509
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:42,685
Let's go.
You wanna be my drinking buddy?

1510
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:44,436
Wanna practice?

1511
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:47,440
I don't think you could handle it.
You don't? Let me see.

1512
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,843
And you know why?
'Cause you're too worried about

1513
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:52,261
- what everybody else is thinking.
- Here we go.

1514
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,617
Here we go, Jack.
You want me to be your dad?

1515
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:56,403
- Be your drinking buddy?
- Yeah.

1516
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:58,663
Yeah, you couldn't be my dad
if you fucking tried.

1517
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,434
He had more talent in his fucking finger

1518
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,060
than you have
in your whole fucking body.

1519
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:04,540
So don't even fucking go there
about that, all right?

1520
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,879
That's over the fucking line.

1521
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:08,330
Why don't you have another drink

1522
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:11,877
and we can just get fucking drunk
until we fucking disappear, okay?

1523
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:13,886
Hey! Do you got those pills
in your pocket?

1524
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:15,326
You're just fucking ugly, that's all.

1525
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,762
- I'm what?
- You're just fucking ugly.

1526
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:19,843
Get the fuck out.

1527
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:21,261
Get out!

1528
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:24,306
I said, get out!

1529
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:25,484
Fine.

1530
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,947
(Crowd cheering)

1531
01:29:35,996 --> 01:29:38,487
(Sniffs) (High-pitched ringing)

1532
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:47,624
Good evening.

1533
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,961
(Playing country music)

1534
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,046
(Crowd cheering loudly)

1535
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,161
- Richy: Down!
- (Pop music playing)

1536
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:00,675
Seven and eight, and pump.

1537
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:04,346
Two, three, four, five, six, seven...

1538
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:05,730
Pull it!

1539
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:09,985
Six... come on, feel it... (Grunting)

1540
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:14,732
Hit! Down, up! High! Swing it!

1541
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:16,862
Six... come on! Yes!

1542
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:18,614
Ally: (Singing) Tryin' to leave you

1543
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:21,905
but you won't let me leave
sayin' that about me

1544
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,914
got me thinkin' I'll never succeed

1545
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:25,117
richy: Hold the music!

1546
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,411
- That was great.
- What are you doin' here?

1547
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:31,958
Something fell through, so I was able
to come back a few days early.

1548
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:37,671
I think I might have said some things...

1549
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:45,270
Just how I acted.

1550
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:48,723
You hurt me.

1551
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,401
You really hurt me.

1552
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,195
Sorry.

1553
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:12,630
You haven't been drinking.

1554
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,840
What'd you say?

1555
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:17,844
I said you haven't been drinking.
I can tell.

1556
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:19,504
No, I haven't. No.

1557
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,730
- I have to get back to rehearsal...
- Oh, yeah.

1558
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:24,680
Can I watch?

1559
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:26,803
Yeah, okay.

1560
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,850
Meet me at home.

1561
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,440
Or I can wait and drive you home.

1562
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:34,686
- Just meet me at home.
- Okay.

1563
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,084
What do you mean,
they don't want me to sing?

1564
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:40,275
They hired this fucking kid
at the last minute.

1565
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,694
They didn't tell me a fucking thing.

1566
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:49,956
Look, we've been
on that other side before.

1567
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:52,128
More than once.

1568
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:53,757
Yeanh.

1569
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:56,499
Truth is, I didn't deliver.

1570
01:31:57,303 --> 01:31:59,544
Well, it's a good thing
I know the, uh...

1571
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:03,719
(Chuckles) How to play the guitar.
It's fine, I'll do it.

1572
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:07,052
- You're gonna do it?
- Sure.

1573
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:12,140
Marlon: (Singing)
I couldn't help but see

1574
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:13,395
pretty woman

1575
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:17,274
hey, where's the wedges?
Can't fucking hear with the...

1576
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,155
Is the monitor here?

1577
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:22,279
Are you lonely just like me

1578
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:25,699
(tuning guitar)

1579
01:32:29,502 --> 01:32:33,211
Pretty woman, walk a while

1580
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:37,124
pretty woman, talk a while

1581
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:42,467
pretty woman, give your smile to me

1582
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:48,852
pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah

1583
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:51,638
but, yeah, like I said,
it's a real honor.

1584
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,807
Yeah. Oh, honor's mine.

1585
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,521
Yeah, you're great. It'll be fun.

1586
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,356
Yeah, hope so. Yeah.

1587
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,284
- Who coulda been a crooner?
- (All laughing)

1588
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:09,374
Right?

1589
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,704
(Operatic music playing)
You remember what Paul said.

1590
01:33:11,795 --> 01:33:15,754
Both: "Paul anka told me
I had more natural talent...

1591
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,255
"Than Sinatra."
- Than frank.

1592
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:19,131
- That's it! Do not...
- Direct quote!

1593
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:21,030
Wolfie: Do you know what Paul anka
actually said to him?

1594
01:33:21,054 --> 01:33:23,045
Lorenzo: No, what did he say?
Wolfie: He said,

1595
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:27,136
"would you please pull the car over
and let me out over here on the curb?"

1596
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:30,890
All right, but... oh, my god!

1597
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:32,812
Sweetheart.

1598
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:34,893
This is unreal.

1599
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:36,774
The grammys.

1600
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:38,585
Jack: Hey, look at everybody.
How are you?

1601
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:39,778
Lorenzo: Hey, there he is!

1602
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:42,113
- Oh, thanks.
- ( Whispers) How are you?

1603
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:44,156
(Softly) Are you okay?

1604
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:46,283
- What's that?
- Are you okay?

1605
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:48,161
Are you okay?

1606
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:49,558
- Oh, yeah, I'm great.
- Are you sure?

1607
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:50,947
Yeah, I'm great.

1608
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:54,163
They have me going in early,
so I gotta go now and then, um...

1609
01:33:54,337 --> 01:33:56,482
But I made sure that they tell me
where you're sitting,

1610
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:57,666
so that I can go right after.

1611
01:33:57,799 --> 01:33:59,276
Okay.
'Cause I don't wanna miss the awards

1612
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:00,820
- because it's right before it.
- Okay.

1613
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,905
- Looks great.
- You just got that look on your face.

1614
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:04,920
I do? Watch, it's gone.

1615
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,180
Amazing. Gonna get to see
you perform tonight,

1616
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,635
get to see you sing.

1617
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:12,553
Hey, Jack, that's
an incredible collection of vinyl

1618
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:13,936
you have in there.

1619
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:16,098
Take whatever you want. It's yours.

1620
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:17,814
Take whatever I want?

1621
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:19,851
He just said, "take whatever you want."

1622
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:22,528
(Chuckles) He's talking
to the wrong guys.

1623
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:24,025
(Indistinct chatter)

1624
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:31,947
(High-pitched ringing)

1625
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:34,620
(Breathing heavily)

1626
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:40,121
(Crowd cheering)

1627
01:34:45,138 --> 01:34:49,381
(Singing) Pretty woman

1628
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:55,270
walkin' down the street
pretty woman

1629
01:34:56,065 --> 01:35:02,436
the kind I'd like to meet
pretty woman

1630
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:04,983
I thought he was supposed to be singing.

1631
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:10,073
I don't believe you
you're not the truth

1632
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:13,454
no one could look as good as you

1633
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,747
oh, god!

1634
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,674
(Playing guitar lick)

1635
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:51,777
- Pretty woman
- Won't you pardon me

1636
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:55,368
pretty woman
I couldn't help but see

1637
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:57,827
pretty woman

1638
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:02,541
that you look lovely as can be

1639
01:36:03,883 --> 01:36:08,126
are you lonely just like me

1640
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:16,221
Oh, it's over? It's over?

1641
01:36:17,981 --> 01:36:19,892
- You good?
- I'm fine.

1642
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,479
And the nominees are...

1643
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:31,115
Jack: Right here?
Announcer: Roxy carlile.

1644
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:34,527
Come on, baby.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

1645
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:37,948
- Hi. You okay?
- I was trying to go to the men's room,

1646
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:40,526
- and they rushed me over here.
- Okay, put your legs inside.

1647
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:43,043
- I had to go to the bathroom.
- Put your legs inside.

1648
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:46,001
They're announcing
your fucking category. Keep quiet.

1649
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:48,917
- And the winner is...
Jack: Yeah...

1650
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:50,710
Oh, this is exciting.

1651
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:52,264
How great.

1652
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,926
Ally! (All cheering)

1653
01:36:57,603 --> 01:37:00,686
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

1654
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,768
Oh, my god!

1655
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:04,853
This is amazing!

1656
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:07,314
Jack: All right. What happened?
Ally: Baby... we won!

1657
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:10,275
- Is that why everybody's...
- Yep, that's right!

1658
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:12,532
Man: Yeah, ally!

1659
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:14,238
Where are we going?

1660
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:16,198
Just stay right here.
Go sit back there.

1661
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:17,908
Go sit back there.

1662
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,864
(High-pitched ringing)

1663
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:22,075
I'll stay here.

1664
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:31,084
Oh, my gosh, thank you!
You look beautiful. Thank you!

1665
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,674
Oh, wow!

1666
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,679
Oh, my gosh!

1667
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:38,557
I can't believe
I'm holding one of these.

1668
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:41,849
Thank you to rez gavron, my manager.

1669
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:45,015
- Thank you for believing in me...
- Jack: Wait, did you win?

1670
01:37:45,193 --> 01:37:48,651
And telling me to get back from
behind the piano and onto the stage.

1671
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:51,194
Did you just win?

1672
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:56,408
Thank you to my...
To Jack Maine, my husband.

1673
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:58,786
- Should I come up there?
- I love you so much.

1674
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:02,164
I always wanted to be a singer
on a big stage

1675
01:38:02,335 --> 01:38:04,917
and because of him, I am.

1676
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:06,835
(Crowd cheering)
(Ally chuckles nervously)

1677
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:10,839
- We're having a lot of fun tonight.
- Yeah.

1678
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:13,296
- I...
- Shit.

1679
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:15,595
Look.

1680
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:25,146
- If I haven't thanked you yet, just...
- Did you see you're up there?

1681
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:26,806
Yeah, I do.

1682
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:28,266
(Crowd laughing)

1683
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:31,444
I started out singing
with this beautiful man,

1684
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:34,822
and I'll sing with him for life.
Right, baby?

1685
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:36,823
- Yeah.
- (Crowd cheering)

1686
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:41,328
I'm so blessed to be in the company

1687
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:43,907
- of such wonderful musicians.
- (Jack sighs)

1688
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:45,495
This is a dream come true,

1689
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:46,855
- and all I can say is...
- (Crowd gasps)

1690
01:38:46,879 --> 01:38:48,790
Believe in yourself,
and don't give up

1691
01:38:48,965 --> 01:38:51,001
because there is a spot
on that stage for you.

1692
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:53,416
- Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.
- Good night.

1693
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,593
(Ally gasps)
(Jack mumbling drunkenly)

1694
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:59,350
- I think I peed myself.
- Baby, just turn around.

1695
01:38:59,725 --> 01:39:01,215
Ally: Oh! (Crowd gasps)

1696
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:04,559
- I think I...
- Baby, baby, can you...

1697
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:05,958
- I think that's a bad comedown.
- Ally: Holy shit!

1698
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:07,042
Just take him to the shower.
Go to the left.

1699
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:08,146
Follow me, wolf.

1700
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:09,644
Ally, you just go inside, okay?

1701
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,579
- It's on the left, dad.
- Lorenzo: I got it.

1702
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:13,173
- Go inside!
- Rez: They got him, they got him.

1703
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:14,258
- They got him!
- It's my job!

1704
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:15,676
Don't you fucking do this
to my daughter.

1705
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:16,700
Hey, hey!

1706
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:18,274
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1707
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:19,989
Get off!

1708
01:39:21,164 --> 01:39:24,372
Damn it! Watch his fucking head.

1709
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:26,873
- (Mumbling drunkenly)
- Watch it, watch it!

1710
01:39:28,254 --> 01:39:29,960
Jack: Bobby'll take you there.

1711
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:33,665
You have Bobby's number?

1712
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:35,466
(Ally crying)

1713
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:37,919
No, Jack, hon, you gotta sit up.

1714
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,302
I don't want you to choke, baby. Sit up!

1715
01:39:42,477 --> 01:39:44,843
All right, I might've taken too much.

1716
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:47,433
- Lorenzo: You all right in there?
- I'm fine.

1717
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:50,897
He's fine.

1718
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:56,403
Carl: So, everybody has their journal,

1719
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,906
and we remember
the homework assignment,

1720
01:39:59,076 --> 01:40:02,159
the three things that I wanted you
to write down.

1721
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:05,242
- Jack, hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

1722
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,078
You can't be late, Jack.

1723
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,618
Understood, sorry.

1724
01:40:10,796 --> 01:40:13,003
Good. Where's your journal?

1725
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:17,341
- It's in my room...
- No, no, no.

1726
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:20,344
Sit down.

1727
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:23,681
So, it's all agreed.
Nobody's ever late here, right?

1728
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:26,058
Okay. Good.

1729
01:40:27,563 --> 01:40:29,474
Anything you wanna tell us?

1730
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:30,896
Um...

1731
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,395
I'm grateful to...

1732
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:41,528
To be here, and, uh...

1733
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:45,403
I'm trying to hold it together.

1734
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:50,624
I'm Jack. I'm an alcoholic.

1735
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:52,205
All: Jack.

1736
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,078
Drug addict.

1737
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:11,346
This is all my fault.

1738
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:13,001
You don't have that kind of power, dad.

1739
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:15,391
Eat your dinner. Eat your food.

1740
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:17,026
I don't even know what meal it is.

1741
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:18,523
(Sniffles)

1742
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:21,064
Go on, have some fruit.

1743
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:26,952
How many times did you carry
my piano up the stairs?

1744
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:31,745
How many times did you sit there
while I wrote a song?

1745
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:38,585
- Always.
- Okay? It's okay. It's okay.

1746
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:41,000
You didn't do anything.
It's not your fault.

1747
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:47,131
You're just the greatest person
in the world.

1748
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:51,639
(Gasping)

1749
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:57,183
Carl: How long have you been here now?

1750
01:41:58,362 --> 01:41:59,693
Jack: Two months.

1751
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:03,606
Can it be fixed?

1752
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:06,555
Well, you would know that, don't you?
Once it's gone, it's gone.

1753
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:07,739
I don't know what you have.

1754
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:09,786
Oh, well, the tinnitus,
they say, once you...

1755
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:12,619
- Well, tinnitus can't be fixed.
- Right.

1756
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:17,704
Well, I just hear that tone, that's all.
The tone, yeah.

1757
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:19,463
The ringing.

1758
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:22,931
- I have hearing aids on, as you...
- No, I know. That's why I asked you.

1759
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,923
You know, I'm convinced that

1760
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:28,848
it happened when I was younger,
I used to...

1761
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:32,886
My dad had a victrola,
an old record player.

1762
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:35,729
My head was just about the size of it
when I was a kid,

1763
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:38,858
and I used to love to just
put my whole head in there.

1764
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:42,778
He was big into the blues, so...

1765
01:42:44,283 --> 01:42:47,116
'Cause you gotta figure,
it's just me and him all day long.

1766
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:51,495
My brother's out there tryin'
to make something of himself.

1767
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:58,787
So I took one of his belts.
I put it around the ceiling fan

1768
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,044
and tried to do the deed.

1769
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:06,551
The whole fucking fan
came out of the ceiling.

1770
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,254
(Both laughing)

1771
01:43:14,563 --> 01:43:17,430
Had a big cut on my fucking forehead.

1772
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:21,521
I was more mad about that
than it not working.

1773
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:25,192
And he didn't even notice.

1774
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:28,027
He didn't even fucking notice.

1775
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:30,067
- 'Cause he was drunk?
- Yeah.

1776
01:43:32,832 --> 01:43:36,416
That fucking fan stayed on the floor
for about half a year.

1777
01:43:38,796 --> 01:43:40,161
How old were you then?

1778
01:43:40,881 --> 01:43:43,167
I was just shy of 13.

1779
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:48,715
(Door opens)

1780
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:52,809
Jack: Aww!

1781
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,351
(Both chuckling)

1782
01:43:58,482 --> 01:43:59,847
You smell good.

1783
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:03,442
You smell good, and you look good too.

1784
01:44:07,408 --> 01:44:08,568
Swimming. I've been swimming.

1785
01:44:08,743 --> 01:44:10,220
- You've been swimming?
- Yeah, there's a pool.

1786
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:12,109
- I love that you're swimming.
- Yeah.

1787
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:14,574
- That's a great pool there.
- Yeah.

1788
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:16,034
How's Charlie?

1789
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:18,123
Oh, Charlie's sweet.

1790
01:44:18,294 --> 01:44:20,785
He just sort of sits
by the door like this.

1791
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:25,505
Waiting for daddy.

1792
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:31,383
We're both waiting for daddy.

1793
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,017
What, three weeks?

1794
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:38,519
You are gonna come back, right?

1795
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:41,351
What do you mean?

1796
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,561
You gonna come home when you're done?

1797
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,481
- Do you not want me to?
- No, I want you to.

1798
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:48,862
I'm just wondering if... I just...

1799
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:50,385
- Where else would I go?
- I don't know.

1800
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:52,209
I guess I just thought...
You know, it's like,

1801
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:54,319
- there's Jack...
- Wait, wait, wait.

1802
01:44:54,497 --> 01:44:56,783
- Why would you say that?
- I don't know. I guess...

1803
01:44:56,957 --> 01:45:00,370
I wondered, without the booze,
if you would want to come home.

1804
01:45:00,544 --> 01:45:03,661
'Cause when you met me,
you were drinking, and now you're not.

1805
01:45:03,839 --> 01:45:05,750
I wasn't drunk the whole time
we were together.

1806
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,881
I know, but...

1807
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:11,843
But it got bad when we were together.

1808
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:13,970
It's okay. I mean, it's fine.

1809
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:16,382
I just was wondering, that's all,

1810
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,893
and whatever you want is okay.

1811
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:22,396
Whatever I want? I wanna be with you.

1812
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:25,399
- That's why I'm here.
- Okay, I know, I know.

1813
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:27,935
I just want you to be happy.

1814
01:45:29,281 --> 01:45:30,942
I'm working on that.

1815
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:36,531
I need to stick with you.

1816
01:45:40,376 --> 01:45:41,786
I brought something.

1817
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:45,790
I wanna know

1818
01:45:47,299 --> 01:45:48,709
what this is.

1819
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,255
"My love."

1820
01:45:52,763 --> 01:45:55,345
- You hiding love songs?
- (Chuckles)

1821
01:45:55,432 --> 01:45:57,263
No, I wouldn't...

1822
01:45:57,434 --> 01:46:00,267
I wouldn't say I was hiding it.
I just...

1823
01:46:02,815 --> 01:46:05,557
I started puttin' it down to paper
when we were at home.

1824
01:46:08,445 --> 01:46:12,529
I don't know, it sort of fell out of me,
I guess, and onto this page.

1825
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:18,660
And I put it in here, and I thought...

1826
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:24,742
I thought maybe
you'd find it when, uh...

1827
01:46:28,173 --> 01:46:30,164
When you came back to you, maybe.

1828
01:46:39,602 --> 01:46:41,058
Well, I found it.

1829
01:46:49,278 --> 01:46:50,814
Listen.

1830
01:46:56,118 --> 01:46:57,483
I'm, uh...

1831
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:14,465
I'm sorry, uh...

1832
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:17,594
(Sobbing)

1833
01:47:21,143 --> 01:47:22,633
It's okay.

1834
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:27,805
L... (Continues sobbing)

1835
01:47:28,943 --> 01:47:30,854
It's okay. It's not your fault.

1836
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:33,401
I'm sorry I did that.

1837
01:47:35,574 --> 01:47:36,859
It's okay.

1838
01:47:37,493 --> 01:47:39,825
It's not your fault. It's a disease.

1839
01:47:42,081 --> 01:47:43,912
No, but I embarrassed you.

1840
01:47:46,251 --> 01:47:49,288
- I embarrassed you, and I...
- I'm not embarrassed of you.

1841
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:51,662
It was so wrong.

1842
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:55,375
And then your dad... (Sobbing)

1843
01:47:57,972 --> 01:47:59,837
My father loves you, it's okay.

1844
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:04,224
I know, but I...

1845
01:48:06,730 --> 01:48:08,971
- It's okay.
- I know, but I...

1846
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:10,810
It's okay.

1847
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:13,979
It's okay.

1848
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:18,822
I have figured out what I think is
the best solution for both of us.

1849
01:48:18,993 --> 01:48:21,109
Jack should come out on tour with me.

1850
01:48:21,286 --> 01:48:23,698
We'll start with our duets.
I know he's gonna be able

1851
01:48:23,872 --> 01:48:26,238
- to play by himself.
- You realize that's not an option.

1852
01:48:27,042 --> 01:48:30,000
He's so inside of his art
in a way he has never been.

1853
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:32,912
- He can hear himself again.
- Ally, there is no way

1854
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:36,753
that you can take Jack on tour with you.
There is no way.

1855
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:44,340
(Playing melancholy music)

1856
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:51,388
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1857
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:53,327
You know what?
If you can't make that happen,

1858
01:48:53,402 --> 01:48:55,762
then fucking cancel the tour.
I don't know what to tell you.

1859
01:49:02,703 --> 01:49:03,863
(Crying)

1860
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:17,294
I think if we had a better band name,
we might've made it.

1861
01:49:20,262 --> 01:49:23,800
Or maybe it was 'cause
we looked like a father-and-son duo.

1862
01:49:23,891 --> 01:49:25,176
(Laughing)

1863
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,428
Not many of those around.

1864
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:30,518
I was not a good look for you,
that's for sure.

1865
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:33,855
Not my fault I couldn't find
a better guitar player

1866
01:49:34,026 --> 01:49:36,267
in the whole goddamn state.

1867
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:44,695
Where in the fuck is it?

1868
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:47,156
Right here.

1869
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:55,828
Thanks for the ride.

1870
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:00,586
Sure thing, Jack.

1871
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:06,555
Hey, you know, uh... when I, um...

1872
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:16,686
When I said I would...
You know, when I...

1873
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:26,525
Took your voice, you know.

1874
01:50:36,046 --> 01:50:38,162
(Tearfully) It's you I idolized.
It wasn't dad.

1875
01:51:22,968 --> 01:51:24,378
(Ally singing)

1876
01:51:24,469 --> 01:51:26,084
(Barking)

1877
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:29,221
(Grunts)

1878
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:31,469
What's that, guy?

1879
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:37,145
(Ally laughs)

1880
01:51:41,904 --> 01:51:43,269
Hey.

1881
01:51:43,947 --> 01:51:45,528
Jack: Hey.

1882
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:48,861
I wanna know how you hear this.

1883
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:50,616
(Jack sighs)

1884
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:52,544
It sounded unbelievable,
what you were playing.

1885
01:51:52,664 --> 01:51:54,655
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's nice to hear it.

1886
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:58,792
Thank you, and I had the beautiful
backdrop of you and Charlie.

1887
01:51:59,087 --> 01:52:00,497
(Both laugh awkwardly)

1888
01:52:00,589 --> 01:52:05,003
I only heard it in my mind for so many
weeks, so it's good to hear it...

1889
01:52:05,093 --> 01:52:07,254
- (Chuckles)
- The words are beautiful.

1890
01:52:07,346 --> 01:52:09,382
In the real thing. In the real thing.

1891
01:52:09,473 --> 01:52:11,304
(Playing slow music)

1892
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:16,810
- Wait, you want me to do that?
- Mmm-hmm.

1893
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:19,764
Oh, god, I don't know.
I knew you were gonna ask me.

1894
01:52:19,858 --> 01:52:21,064
(Ally laughing)

1895
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:22,982
(Continues playing slow music)

1896
01:52:40,504 --> 01:52:41,960
(Sighs)

1897
01:52:45,384 --> 01:52:46,965
Rez: Back from the dead.

1898
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:50,882
Hey, sorry. Were you waiting long?

1899
01:52:50,973 --> 01:52:53,214
- No, no.
- (Charlie growlys)

1900
01:52:53,308 --> 01:52:55,299
Uh... ally's not home.

1901
01:52:55,477 --> 01:52:57,684
No, I told her I'd meet her here,
if that's okay.

1902
01:52:57,896 --> 01:52:59,261
Of course, yeah.

1903
01:53:04,987 --> 01:53:06,193
Here you go.

1904
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:09,696
Hey, thanks for taking care of my girl
when I was gone.

1905
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:11,276
Anything for her.

1906
01:53:12,786 --> 01:53:15,368
She told me about that European leg.

1907
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:18,823
That's a hell of an accomplishment
this soon out of the gate.

1908
01:53:19,376 --> 01:53:22,709
Shit, I remember it was like 10 years

1909
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:26,588
- before I even went across the pond.
- It was summer, 2004.

1910
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:28,623
Shit, was it?

1911
01:53:34,308 --> 01:53:36,264
We're not exactly friends here.

1912
01:53:39,604 --> 01:53:42,311
While you've been away, we've been
back here in serious triage,

1913
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:44,814
trying to clean up your fucking mess.

1914
01:53:44,985 --> 01:53:47,351
Barely finding our way through it.

1915
01:53:49,031 --> 01:53:51,092
You almost single-handedly derailed
her whole career.

1916
01:53:51,116 --> 01:53:52,731
You understand that?

1917
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:55,025
She's never gonna say this to you.

1918
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:58,074
She loves you too much.

1919
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:02,374
Just by staying married to you,
she looks like a joke.

1920
01:54:02,544 --> 01:54:04,580
It's embarrassing.

1921
01:54:05,797 --> 01:54:08,038
Let's be honest, we both know
it's only a matter of time

1922
01:54:08,216 --> 01:54:10,958
before that's pushed aside again
for the real thing.

1923
01:54:11,887 --> 01:54:13,752
And when that happens,

1924
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:17,464
I don't want her anywhere near you.

1925
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:29,570
Hey.

1926
01:54:33,658 --> 01:54:35,239
I have some good news.

1927
01:54:36,078 --> 01:54:37,784
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1928
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:39,736
I'm not gonna go to Europe.

1929
01:54:40,665 --> 01:54:45,079
We're gonna cancel the rest of the tour,
and I'm just gonna be here all summer.

1930
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:49,162
Isn't that great?

1931
01:54:50,884 --> 01:54:52,090
What happened?

1932
01:54:52,386 --> 01:54:53,592
Nothing happened.

1933
01:54:54,179 --> 01:54:57,342
The label just loves the record,
and it's doing so well,

1934
01:54:57,516 --> 01:55:00,758
and they wanna keep with the momentum

1935
01:55:01,103 --> 01:55:02,934
and have me make another one.

1936
01:55:03,522 --> 01:55:06,855
Rez is super psyched,
so it'll be great.

1937
01:55:09,319 --> 01:55:11,856
So tonight's gonna be my last show.

1938
01:55:13,156 --> 01:55:15,738
Going out with a bang at the forum.

1939
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:19,822
Great.

1940
01:55:19,996 --> 01:55:21,361
Yeanh.

1941
01:55:25,210 --> 01:55:27,166
Why don't you come with me?

1942
01:55:29,131 --> 01:55:30,496
We can sing shallow together.

1943
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:33,086
The fans will go crazy to see you.

1944
01:55:36,596 --> 01:55:38,552
Come on, cowboy.

1945
01:55:43,228 --> 01:55:44,968
Yeah, why not? Okay.

1946
01:55:46,731 --> 01:55:47,731
Yeah?

1947
01:55:48,275 --> 01:55:49,640
Okay, good.

1948
01:55:49,818 --> 01:55:51,354
I'll have a car come get you.

1949
01:55:51,903 --> 01:55:53,143
Once I get there.

1950
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:55,270
I'm gonna meet you there.

1951
01:56:04,499 --> 01:56:06,330
I'll see you soon, okay?

1952
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:11,964
Hey.

1953
01:56:13,175 --> 01:56:14,175
What?

1954
01:56:16,928 --> 01:56:19,385
I just wanted to take
another look at you.

1955
01:56:23,143 --> 01:56:24,349
(Chuckles)

1956
01:56:24,436 --> 01:56:25,642
Bye, honey.

1957
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:27,521
Bye.

1958
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:35,902
(Sighs)

1959
01:56:58,803 --> 01:57:00,384
Come here, Charlie.

1960
01:57:00,555 --> 01:57:01,761
Come here.

1961
01:57:38,009 --> 01:57:40,546
Ally: Thank you so much
for bringing us all here together.

1962
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,928
Please look over
all of the dancers tonight and the band,

1963
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:45,339
and my husband, Jackson.

1964
01:57:45,517 --> 01:57:47,929
We're so excited for him
to be here with us.

1965
01:57:48,019 --> 01:57:49,975
(Sighs) We got a big night.

1966
01:57:50,146 --> 01:57:51,499
We're at the forum in la.
Let's do this.

1967
01:57:51,523 --> 01:57:52,523
(All whooping)

1968
01:57:52,607 --> 01:57:54,268
(Crowd cheering)

1969
01:58:29,769 --> 01:58:31,976
(Jack breathing heavily)

1970
01:58:33,815 --> 01:58:35,305
(Sniffles)

1971
01:58:55,211 --> 01:58:56,792
(Crying)

1972
01:59:56,898 --> 01:59:58,292
Ally: (Singing) Why did you do that?

1973
01:59:58,316 --> 01:59:59,476
(Music ends) (Crowd cheering)

1974
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:01,645
Is he here?

1975
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:02,935
Rez: He's not here.

1976
02:00:03,113 --> 02:00:04,113
Ally: He's not here?

1977
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:06,271
Rez: We have to do shallow
regardless, okay?

1978
02:00:06,991 --> 02:00:09,303
The guitar's up there. Everything's
gonna remain the same, okay?

1979
02:00:09,327 --> 02:00:10,327
Ally: What?

1980
02:00:10,412 --> 02:00:12,348
Rez: The guitar's up there.
Everything's gonna remain the same.

1981
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:13,372
Both verses.

1982
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:15,267
I'm sure it was just a bit much for him,
that's all.

1983
02:00:15,291 --> 02:00:16,727
Ally: Please send somebody
to the house, please.

1984
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:17,957
Rez: I'm doing it right now.

1985
02:00:18,128 --> 02:00:19,618
I have 15 seconds.

1986
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:24,544
(Singing) /n the shallow shallow

1987
02:00:25,218 --> 02:00:29,177
in the shallow shallow

1988
02:00:30,223 --> 02:00:34,011
in the shallow shallow

1989
02:00:34,185 --> 02:00:38,053
we're far from the shallow now

1990
02:00:38,148 --> 02:00:40,184
(vocalizing)

1991
02:00:42,444 --> 02:00:43,854
(Crowd cheering)

1992
02:00:49,993 --> 02:00:52,450
Give it up for my husband, Jackson.

1993
02:00:55,123 --> 02:00:56,533
(Charlie whimpering)

1994
02:01:21,441 --> 02:01:23,432
(Ally playing melancholy music
on piano)

1995
02:01:39,626 --> 02:01:40,832
(Music ends)

1996
02:01:51,346 --> 02:01:53,211
I can stay, if you want.

1997
02:02:11,241 --> 02:02:12,526
(Yelling)

1998
02:02:30,969 --> 02:02:32,675
Some kid started singing
one of his songs

1999
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:34,753
in a bar I was in the other night.

2000
02:02:38,393 --> 02:02:40,759
They're playing his songs everywhere.

2001
02:02:44,691 --> 02:02:46,647
At first I got angry.

2002
02:02:48,194 --> 02:02:49,434
I don't know why.

2003
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:53,237
I guess I felt like,

2004
02:02:54,909 --> 02:02:57,742
how can any of these people
feel like they knew him?

2005
02:02:58,454 --> 02:03:00,240
Who he really was.

2006
02:03:03,668 --> 02:03:05,750
But then something changed.

2007
02:03:07,589 --> 02:03:09,375
And it soothed me.

2008
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:15,798
That it wasn't all for fucking nothing.

2009
02:03:15,889 --> 02:03:17,049
(Crying)

2010
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:19,882
The last thing I did was lie to him.

2011
02:03:22,145 --> 02:03:23,760
Listen to me.

2012
02:03:25,815 --> 02:03:27,555
It isn't your fault.

2013
02:03:29,235 --> 02:03:30,725
It just isn't.

2014
02:03:32,864 --> 02:03:34,855
You know whose fault it was?

2015
02:03:35,283 --> 02:03:36,443
Jack.

2016
02:03:39,203 --> 02:03:40,613
That's it.

2017
02:03:42,123 --> 02:03:43,533
No one else.

2018
02:03:44,042 --> 02:03:46,283
Not you, not me.

2019
02:03:47,045 --> 02:03:48,251
No one but Jack.

2020
02:03:48,421 --> 02:03:50,082
I just keep

2021
02:03:51,174 --> 02:03:54,257
going over and over it,
over it in my head.

2022
02:03:58,473 --> 02:04:02,967
Jack talked about how music is
essentially 12 notes between any octave.

2023
02:04:06,606 --> 02:04:09,063
Twelve notes, and the octave repeats.

2024
02:04:12,528 --> 02:04:14,393
It's the same story,

2025
02:04:15,573 --> 02:04:18,110
told over and over.

2026
02:04:18,826 --> 02:04:20,191
Forever.

2027
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:24,612
All any artist can offer the world

2028
02:04:25,041 --> 02:04:27,453
is how they see those 12 notes.

2029
02:04:27,919 --> 02:04:29,159
That's it.

2030
02:04:30,088 --> 02:04:31,294
(Chuckles)

2031
02:04:36,427 --> 02:04:38,463
He loved how you see them.

2032
02:04:40,348 --> 02:04:42,304
He just kept saying,

2033
02:04:43,101 --> 02:04:46,389
"I love how she sees them, Bobby."

2034
02:04:54,696 --> 02:04:57,153
Hello, I'm ally Maine.

2035
02:04:59,367 --> 02:05:02,825
Thank you for being here tonight
to honor my husband.

2036
02:05:03,204 --> 02:05:04,785
He wrote a song for me.

2037
02:05:05,415 --> 02:05:08,202
I'd like to sing it for him tonight.

2038
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:11,955
And with your help, maybe I can.

2039
02:05:12,463 --> 02:05:13,953
(Audience applauding)

2040
02:05:14,048 --> 02:05:15,379
Thank you.

2041
02:05:16,259 --> 02:05:17,465
Really.

2042
02:05:18,511 --> 02:05:20,217
Thank you.

2043
02:05:20,638 --> 02:05:22,720

2044
02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:40,438
(Singing) Wish I could

2045
02:05:41,325 --> 02:05:44,817
I could've said goodbye

2046
02:05:45,955 --> 02:05:49,698
I would've said what I wanted to

2047
02:05:51,252 --> 02:05:54,289
maybe even cried for you

2048
02:05:55,882 --> 02:05:58,624
if I knew

2049
02:05:59,594 --> 02:06:03,052
it would be the last time

2050
02:06:04,098 --> 02:06:07,556
I would've broke my heart in two

2051
02:06:08,978 --> 02:06:12,470
trying to save a part of you

2052
02:06:13,691 --> 02:06:16,979
don't wanna feel another touch

2053
02:06:18,029 --> 02:06:21,237
don't wanna start another fire

2054
02:06:22,366 --> 02:06:25,984
don't wanna know another kiss

2055
02:06:27,038 --> 02:06:31,452
no other name falling off my lips

2056
02:06:31,834 --> 02:06:35,292
don't wanna give my heart away

2057
02:06:36,756 --> 02:06:39,919
to another stranger

2058
02:06:40,718 --> 02:06:44,176
or let another day begin

2059
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:48,507
won't even let the sunlight in

2060
02:06:49,227 --> 02:06:53,846
no, I'll never love

2061
02:06:54,774 --> 02:06:56,514
again

2062
02:06:58,194 --> 02:07:00,936
I'll never love again

2063
02:07:01,823 --> 02:07:03,688
(vocalizing)

2064
02:07:11,624 --> 02:07:13,865
When we first met

2065
02:07:14,794 --> 02:07:17,786
I never thought that I would fall

2066
02:07:19,215 --> 02:07:22,628
I never thought that I'd find myself

2067
02:07:24,137 --> 02:07:26,799
lying in your arms

2068
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:32,433
and I wanna pretend that it's not true

2069
02:07:33,104 --> 02:07:35,561
oh, baby, that you're gone

2070
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:41,647
'cause my world keeps turning
and turning and turning

2071
02:07:41,821 --> 02:07:44,858
but I'm not moving on

2072
02:07:45,324 --> 02:07:48,862
don't wanna feel another touch

2073
02:07:49,704 --> 02:07:53,447
don't wanna start another fire

2074
02:07:54,041 --> 02:07:57,454
don't wanna know another kiss

2075
02:07:58,462 --> 02:08:02,580
no other name falling off my lips

2076
02:08:02,758 --> 02:08:06,125
don't wanna give my heart away

2077
02:08:07,638 --> 02:08:11,222
to another stranger

2078
02:08:11,392 --> 02:08:14,884
or let another day begin

2079
02:08:15,396 --> 02:08:19,059
won't even let the sunlight in

2080
02:08:19,233 --> 02:08:22,225
no, I'll never love

2081
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:26,358
I don't wanna know this feeling

2082
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:29,649
unless it's you and me

2083
02:08:30,870 --> 02:08:33,953
I don't wanna waste a moment

2084
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:35,701
(vocalizing)

2085
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:43,663
And I don't wanna give somebody else

2086
02:08:43,841 --> 02:08:46,253
the better part of me

2087
02:08:48,304 --> 02:08:51,387
I would rather wait for you

2088
02:08:51,474 --> 02:08:53,556
(vocalizing)

2089
02:08:58,606 --> 02:09:01,473
Don't wanna feel another touch

2090
02:09:02,026 --> 02:09:05,063
don't wanna start another fire

2091
02:09:06,072 --> 02:09:09,735
don't wanna know another kiss

2092
02:09:10,826 --> 02:09:14,660
baby, unless they are your lips

2093
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:18,539
don't wanna give my heart away

2094
02:09:20,253 --> 02:09:23,711
to another stranger

2095
02:09:24,257 --> 02:09:27,249
don't let another day begin

2096
02:09:28,261 --> 02:09:31,298
won't let the sunlight in

2097
02:09:32,348 --> 02:09:35,556
oh, I'll never love again

2098
02:09:35,643 --> 02:09:36,883
(ally sighs)

2099
02:09:36,978 --> 02:09:39,014
Never love again

2100
02:09:39,105 --> 02:09:40,436
(ally laughing)

2101
02:09:42,316 --> 02:09:44,523
Never love again

2102
02:09:46,988 --> 02:09:48,603
oh, I'll

2103
02:09:49,949 --> 02:09:52,315
never

2104
02:09:53,494 --> 02:09:54,950
love again

2105
02:15:30,873 --> 02:15:31,873

3
00:01:55,038 --> 00:01:56,173
Move!

4
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:05,415
Thank you, gentlemen.
Gently, if you please.

5
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:14,924
Hmm.

6
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:47,390
Hmm.

7
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:54,632
Mary!

8
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,519
Shouldn't you be out?

9
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,323
We could do with more shells.

10
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,960
Them little ammonites,
tourist tut.

11
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:26,630
And driftwood.

12
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:31,000
Before I catch my death.

13
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:25,209
What are you doing?

14
00:09:32,795 --> 00:09:34,431
Yes.

15
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:36,599
No, please,
don't let me disturb you.

16
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:39,803
- I am very content to watch you work.
- The shop's closed, sir.

17
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,571
It's wonderful, isn't it?

18
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:42,972
<i>Cornu ammonis?</i>

19
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:44,474
Ammonite.

20
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:46,876
It's a broken one.

21
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:48,644
It's still a fine specimen.

22
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:49,946
Is there something
you wanted, sir?

23
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:54,850
Sorry. Please, let me introduce myself,
Miss Anning. Roderick Murchison.

24
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:01,457
I must confess
I'm a little in awe.

25
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,727
Your reputation is something
I've often heard discussed

26
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,595
in the Geographical Society
in London.

27
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,700
- All boys together.
- Yes, well...

28
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,102
Quite.

29
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,939
But your insights,
your skills, are legendary

30
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:19,842
and I thought for my archaeological
tour of the Continent,

31
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,712
how could I miss the
opportunity to meet you?

32
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:25,981
And here you are.

33
00:10:26,014 --> 00:10:27,383
At your work.

34
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,452
I was under the impression
that fine London gentlemen

35
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:32,888
were no longer interested
in my sea creature relics.

36
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:35,958
Fashion moved on, did it not?

37
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:40,596
Quite. I'm afraid
I'm a bit of a late starter.

38
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:42,965
And how could I
not want to meet

39
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:45,000
"the presiding deity of Lyme"?

40
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:50,139
It'd be customary for a
gentleman to write to me

41
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:53,842
to make an appointment
before arriving unannounced.

42
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,545
- Yes, unforgivable.
- Could you not fiddle with that?

43
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,119
Sorry. May I introduce my wife, Mrs.
Charlotte Murchison?

44
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:11,427
Sir, as you can see,
I don't excavate larger pieces any more.

45
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,163
I've seen that particular
relic in the British Museum.

46
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:16,600
A complete ichthyosaurus.
Am I correct?

47
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:19,135
And that's one of yours?

48
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:23,072
It's fascinating.

49
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:30,113
I would love to purchase this ammonite
from you, but I must be honest.

50
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:33,683
What I would dearly appreciate
is the opportunity

51
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:36,952
to spend some time working
with you on the shore,

52
00:11:36,985 --> 00:11:38,654
seeing what you see.

53
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:44,626
I don't conduct
guided tours any more.

54
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:47,696
I'm not a tourist, Miss Anning,
I'm a scientist, like you.

55
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:51,600
A man of the new world and I'm
here to learn all I can from you.

56
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:56,973
And, of course, I am more than happy
to recompense you for your time.

57
00:11:57,974 --> 00:12:01,811
And, obviously,
as it's an inconvenience to yourself,

58
00:12:01,844 --> 00:12:04,915
I would be able to pay a
premium for a private audience.

59
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:09,186
As well as the purchase of
this fine ammonite, of course.

60
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:13,123
It's not easy work.

61
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:16,560
- Good.
- I can't promise we'll find anything.

62
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:18,894
Naturally.

63
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:25,001
- Very well.
- Splendid!

64
00:12:29,138 --> 00:12:32,075
You've no idea what this means to me.

65
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:34,077
My friends
will be most envious.

66
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:41,945
- Do you have a quieter dining room?
- Yes, sir, but...

67
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:45,214
This music's a little
overwhelming for the situation.

68
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:46,750
- Couldn't we...
- Don't make a fuss.

69
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:01,231
- What is the soup?
- Hare.

70
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:03,266
I'll have the oysters.
Are they larded?

71
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:04,833
A la mode, sir.

72
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:08,037
Perfect. And the beef. Rare.

73
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,773
- Very good, sir.
- Braised celery, boiled potatoes.

74
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:13,810
Pouring cream for the potatoes.
Would you bring your wine list?

75
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:16,145
No, wait. Just bring me
a bottle of the claret.

76
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:19,114
We have
the '26 or '35.

77
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:22,118
The '35.

78
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:29,225
And my wife will have some plain
white fish. Baked. No sauce.

79
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:41,457
It's not the right time
to make another baby.

80
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,483
Miss Anning.

81
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:09,385
Miss Anning.

82
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:12,555
Sorry. Am I late?

83
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:15,324
- The old woman in your shop...
- My mother.

84
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,126
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.

85
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:19,428
Your mother said
I would find you here.

86
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:23,867
It was a bright morning,
and the tide was out. I couldn't wait.

87
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:27,836
Yes, of course.
I just didn't want to miss anything.

88
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:30,840
Well, you're here now.

89
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:33,776
Yes.

90
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,035
Nothing.

91
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,105
Beef.

92
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:05,307
Limestone.

93
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,110
- Calcite crystal.
- And this?

94
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:13,182
Look here.

95
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:15,383
There is
a little ammonite inside,

96
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:18,353
but that dimple
tells me it will be crushed.

97
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:21,491
You could chip it out,
but it won't be any good.

98
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:25,994
Oh, that's nice.

99
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:29,264
Coprolite. Very nice.

100
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:31,267
I'm not familiar
with this type.

101
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:33,436
If you look very carefully,

102
00:18:34,436 --> 00:18:36,973
you can see tiny fish bones.

103
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:41,945
Those little black flecks...

104
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:44,246
they're scales.

105
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,115
That'll polish up very nice.

106
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:47,483
Thank you.

107
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:50,219
- But what is it?
- Fossilized feces.

108
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,888
- Pardon?
- Yes, Mr. Murchison.

109
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:54,490
Shit.

110
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:58,227
The tide will be coming in soon.
We ought to be getting back.

111
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:10,072
Charlotte, look what I found
with Miss Anning.

112
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:13,109
Charlotte.

113
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:20,316
- What are you doing?
- Taking you out of this stinking room.

114
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:23,319
- I don't want to.
- I'm afraid that's no longer a choice.

115
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,292
We can't continue like this, Charlotte.
You're like a shadow.

116
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:04,327
It simply won't do.

117
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:06,094
It's madness for me
to expect you

118
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:08,464
to be well enough
to accompany me abroad.

119
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:12,000
- It seems you need more time for your convalescence.
- Roddy...

120
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:17,473
Lyme appears to be
the perfect place for you.

121
00:20:40,596 --> 00:20:42,432
This expedition is extensive.

122
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:45,435
You were prescribed rest.

123
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:48,070
- Sea bathing.
- I don't like the water.

124
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:49,471
Little stimulation.

125
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:54,143
I want my bright, funny,
clever wife back.

126
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:01,117
I don't want to be alone.

127
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:29,111
Is there something else?

128
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:35,283
My wife, Charlotte,

129
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:37,620
she hasn't been
at all well of late.

130
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:39,655
She suffers...

131
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:43,326
Well, it's
mild melancholia, perhaps.

132
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,561
The doctor prescribed
taking the sea air,

133
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:48,363
but it has been a little slow.

134
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:52,368
I have arranged for her
to stay on in Lyme,

135
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:57,205
and although I'm reassured that
she will be well cared for,

136
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:59,174
she would be alone.

137
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:03,645
I was thinking...
hoping, really,

138
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:08,783
what a wonderful opportunity
it would be for her

139
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:10,720
to walk out with you.

140
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,056
- Walk out?
- Yes.

141
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,559
Walk the shoreline with you.

142
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:19,427
- Learn from you.
- I'm not looking for an apprentice.

143
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:21,697
- No, of course not.
- I am in no position

144
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,332
to spend my days
caring for an invalid.

145
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:27,703
No, and...
it wouldn't require you to.

146
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,442
You showed me such courtesy
yesterday, sharing your knowledge,

147
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:38,648
and I was hoping that you might be able
to afford my wife the same generosity.

148
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:43,820
You'll help give her
an interest, as it were.

149
00:22:46,187 --> 00:22:49,624
And it would only be for...
four weeks.

150
00:22:49,657 --> 00:22:51,327
Perhaps five.

151
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:53,663
But no more than six.

152
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:16,184
Excuse me, Mrs. Murchison,
but Mr. Murchison instructed me

153
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:17,753
to help you dress
for your day out today.

154
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:19,388
I'm not going.

155
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,556
I'm very sorry,
Mrs. Murchison,

156
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,292
but Mr. Murchison
was most insistent

157
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:25,527
I get you up out of bed
and dressed immediately.

158
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:30,632
Please don't throw
anything else at me, miss.

159
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:31,774
What is it?

160
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:39,881
Something. Nothing.

161
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:41,917
Shouldn't you excavate it?

162
00:27:43,484 --> 00:27:45,186
I mean,
isn't that what you do?

163
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:47,722
My husband said that's what
you're meant to show me.

164
00:27:47,755 --> 00:27:50,926
Let me be clear.
I don't want you here.

165
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:53,995
Your husband paid me
to take you out with me.

166
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:56,565
Doesn't matter to me
if you wanna be here or not.

167
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:59,801
But please don't question or presume
to tell me how I conduct my business.

168
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:03,805
I came to get help with my illness.
To bathe and to walk.

169
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,075
- Not work like a navvy.
- Bathe?

170
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:09,710
Then may I suggest you rid me of your
bad company and go get better bathing.

171
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:11,880
- My husband...
- Your husband left you.

172
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:31,766
There looks to be fuck all
wrong with you to me.

173
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:05,134
That'll do, boy!

174
00:31:25,674 --> 00:31:26,908
Mother!

175
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:31,079
Mother! Fuck!

176
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,983
Mother!

177
00:31:41,255 --> 00:31:42,390
You're new.

178
00:31:43,123 --> 00:31:44,225
Yes.

179
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:45,994
Foreign?

180
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:48,797
Uh... yes.

181
00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:57,839
There appears to be
a high fever.

182
00:31:57,871 --> 00:32:00,074
Did she take a chill yesterday?

183
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:03,912
- Get wet in the rain, perhaps?
- I don't know.

184
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:07,816
Maybe she went bathing.

185
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:10,918
Oh, yes, water torture.

186
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:13,388
She'll need care.

187
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:16,190
- Night and day.
- I'm not a nurse, Doctor.

188
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:18,394
I barely know the woman.

189
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:21,830
Hmm. Um...

190
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:23,732
Yes.

191
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:27,301
Miss Anning,

192
00:32:28,436 --> 00:32:33,375
it is a woman's position to care
for a fellow sister, is it not?

193
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:44,285
Make sure you keep her warm,
but not too hot.

194
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,723
And cold compresses
should help relieve the fever.

195
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:50,758
I'll write to her husband
and send for her things.

196
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:53,328
And please do call for me
if her condition changes.

197
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:58,966
I'll bid you a good afternoon.

198
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:25,761
How long is she intending
on being in residence?

199
00:33:25,793 --> 00:33:29,263
You should send her home...
to that London.

200
00:33:29,763 --> 00:33:31,500
It's not our responsibility.

201
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:34,802
She might die, Mother.

202
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:37,239
How are we to survive
while you play lady's maid?

203
00:33:37,272 --> 00:33:39,006
We'll manage.

204
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,343
If she is to be
accommodated in my home,

205
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:45,848
with constant care,
and you turfed out of your bed,

206
00:33:46,947 --> 00:33:48,850
that husband of hers
needs to pay more!

207
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:53,548
No.

208
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:04,192
No.

209
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:08,597
I didn't...

210
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:11,532
I didn't see her...

211
00:35:15,636 --> 00:35:17,104
in the ground.

212
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,512
It was cold.

213
00:35:24,612 --> 00:35:25,880
Cold.

214
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:05,247
Mary.

215
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:08,650
Hello.

216
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:10,618
I need to purchase
a jar of salve, please.

217
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,119
Salve?

218
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:15,723
It's not your ma again?
Poor Molly. Is she worse?

219
00:37:16,523 --> 00:37:17,692
Do you want to come in?

220
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:19,627
Just the salve.

221
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:23,031
You look well.

222
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:26,567
I like your hair longer.
It suits you.

223
00:37:29,536 --> 00:37:31,505
I haven't seen you in church
for some time.

224
00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:34,676
Well, I've had my work.

225
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:37,678
Mary, work on Sunday?
Will God forgive you?

226
00:37:43,284 --> 00:37:45,387
You know you can
always ask me for help.

227
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,322
I don't think that'd be
such a good idea.

228
00:37:49,389 --> 00:37:51,292
I came for the salve,
not a sermon.

229
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:54,429
I understand.

230
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:10,478
Keep your coins.
They're hard earned.

231
00:38:17,118 --> 00:38:18,119
Mary...

232
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:22,624
You sure you don't want
to come in?

233
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:31,732
Lightning Mary.

234
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:35,469
<i>Plus ça change.</i>

235
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:32,828
Hmm.

236
00:41:16,297 --> 00:41:17,331
Sorry.

237
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:22,836
All very good.

238
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:24,938
Miss Anning,
I must commend you.

239
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:27,542
I did not expect
to see Mrs. Murchison

240
00:41:27,574 --> 00:41:29,810
looking quite
as radiant as she does.

241
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:33,347
Really. Wonderful work.

242
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,748
Good.

243
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:36,784
Excellent.

244
00:41:37,284 --> 00:41:38,920
A good pot of strong broth.

245
00:41:38,953 --> 00:41:40,922
Keep using the salve,

246
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:43,424
gentle exercise and sea air.

247
00:41:43,456 --> 00:41:46,661
Try not to excite yourself,
Mrs. Murchison.

248
00:41:47,994 --> 00:41:48,996
Good.

249
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,764
Good.

250
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,502
I will call again.

251
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:58,540
Thank you, Miss Anning.

252
00:44:09,904 --> 00:44:11,039
You're up.

253
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:17,011
I was thinking perhaps we might go
out onto the beach this morning.

254
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,846
Just take the air.

255
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,815
If you think I'm strong enough.

256
00:44:22,382 --> 00:44:23,784
Do you think
you're strong enough?

257
00:44:26,186 --> 00:44:27,721
I do, I think.

258
00:44:29,522 --> 00:44:30,824
Good.

259
00:46:50,931 --> 00:46:52,066
Can I help?

260
00:46:55,134 --> 00:46:56,904
You could scrape these.

261
00:47:15,255 --> 00:47:17,025
Maybe you could
get some coal.

262
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:33,674
Outside.

263
00:49:24,118 --> 00:49:25,152
That looks difficult.

264
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:28,156
Dull.

265
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:30,891
Cheap tourist fodder.

266
00:49:31,824 --> 00:49:32,926
Can I try?

267
00:49:47,975 --> 00:49:49,177
Use this...

268
00:49:50,877 --> 00:49:52,080
to stick them down.

269
00:49:56,049 --> 00:49:57,085
This.

270
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:27,348
You look tired.

271
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:31,785
I always look tired.

272
00:50:33,554 --> 00:50:35,790
You look after me
like your child.

273
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:42,863
You don't have any?

274
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:45,165
What a lot of questions.

275
00:50:45,965 --> 00:50:48,301
I might have preferred it
when you were unconscious.

276
00:50:54,241 --> 00:50:55,342
No.

277
00:50:57,143 --> 00:50:58,311
No children.

278
00:51:03,516 --> 00:51:04,551
I'm sorry.

279
00:51:05,853 --> 00:51:06,888
For what?

280
00:51:08,889 --> 00:51:10,324
My mother had ten.

281
00:51:14,127 --> 00:51:15,563
I remember six of them dying.

282
00:51:17,264 --> 00:51:18,833
And two before me.

283
00:51:21,335 --> 00:51:23,070
Eight babies dead.

284
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:27,975
Each one taking something
of her when they went.

285
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:33,481
I have my work.

286
00:51:35,648 --> 00:51:37,851
I didn't need children
as well.

287
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:09,617
You can't keep sleeping
in that chair.

288
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:13,453
You need your rest.
I've taken your bed for too long.

289
00:52:14,621 --> 00:52:16,858
Did you want to go back
to the hotel?

290
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,192
No.

291
00:52:21,962 --> 00:52:23,397
Unless you want me to.

292
00:52:25,197 --> 00:52:26,234
No.

293
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:32,607
We should share the bed.

294
00:54:28,554 --> 00:54:29,757
What are you doing?

295
00:54:30,123 --> 00:54:32,726
- I wanted to help.
- They're mine.

296
00:54:34,094 --> 00:54:35,296
My babies.

297
00:54:44,538 --> 00:54:45,639
Something wrong?

298
00:54:48,442 --> 00:54:49,510
Um...

299
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:53,112
Dr. Lieberson has come
to see you.

300
00:54:53,145 --> 00:54:54,647
Oh, no. Sorry.

301
00:54:54,681 --> 00:54:56,484
More a social visit.

302
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:02,656
My mission was to give this
to you, Miss Anning.

303
00:55:05,225 --> 00:55:06,527
It's an invitation.

304
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,395
A musical evening.

305
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:11,764
I thought after all your work
with Mrs. Murchison,

306
00:55:11,797 --> 00:55:15,368
you might like a little treat.

307
00:55:15,402 --> 00:55:16,637
What about Mrs. Murchison?

308
00:55:18,404 --> 00:55:20,306
Pardon?
I'm not sure I understand.

309
00:55:20,873 --> 00:55:23,743
Well, Mrs. Murchison appreciates
music much more than I do.

310
00:55:23,777 --> 00:55:26,313
Where's her invitation?

311
00:55:26,346 --> 00:55:29,282
I would naturally be accompanied by Mrs.
Murchison in her own right.

312
00:55:29,315 --> 00:55:31,551
- Do you not think?
- Yes.

313
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:35,489
I just thought given
Mrs. Murchison's condition,

314
00:55:35,522 --> 00:55:40,127
this might prove
a little... overstimulating.

315
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:41,561
Rubbish.

316
00:55:41,994 --> 00:55:44,431
As her doctor, I would
strongly advise against it.

317
00:55:44,464 --> 00:55:46,167
And as her friend, I disagree.

318
00:55:46,967 --> 00:55:49,737
Dr. Lieberson, I will
happily attend your recital.

319
00:55:51,237 --> 00:55:52,572
But with Mrs. Murchison.

320
00:55:57,511 --> 00:55:59,779
So be it. Excellent.

321
00:56:00,447 --> 00:56:03,350
I will see you both
this evening, then.

322
00:57:02,342 --> 00:57:04,145
Mary!

323
00:57:56,929 --> 00:57:57,964
Absolutely...

324
00:58:20,052 --> 00:58:21,422
Excuse me.

325
00:58:24,757 --> 00:58:25,960
Miss Anning.

326
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,628
So sorry for neglecting you.

327
00:58:30,897 --> 00:58:32,632
Let me introduce you
to some people.

328
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:35,635
I just need to...

329
00:58:36,402 --> 00:58:37,437
Where's the...

330
00:58:38,237 --> 00:58:41,808
Oh, of course.
It's right through the back.

331
00:58:51,784 --> 00:58:52,953
After you.

332
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:44,471
Ladies, gentlemen, new friends.

333
00:59:44,503 --> 00:59:47,641
Please do take your seats
as we are about to begin.

334
01:00:04,824 --> 01:00:06,627
Do sit here.

335
01:00:11,998 --> 01:00:13,700
This is marvelous.

336
01:02:49,822 --> 01:02:50,991
You left me.

337
01:03:01,701 --> 01:03:02,836
What are you writing?

338
01:03:04,036 --> 01:03:05,272
May I see?

339
01:03:07,574 --> 01:03:08,708
Please, don't be silly.

340
01:03:08,741 --> 01:03:10,143
Let me see.

341
01:03:11,177 --> 01:03:12,546
Please.

342
01:03:22,956 --> 01:03:25,092
"Is it that I am all alone?

343
01:03:25,759 --> 01:03:28,529
Yet in my dreams,
a form I view

344
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:31,764
That thinks on me
and loves me, too.

345
01:03:33,132 --> 01:03:36,069
I start,
and when the vision's flown,

346
01:03:38,705 --> 01:03:40,773
I weep and I am all alone."

347
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:53,286
You were the most fascinating
person there tonight.

348
01:03:55,188 --> 01:03:57,057
And I think
the most beautiful.

349
01:05:21,373 --> 01:05:24,209
Mary, look what's fallen down.

350
01:05:24,243 --> 01:05:26,112
It's the rock thing.

351
01:05:26,878 --> 01:05:27,913
It's too big.

352
01:05:28,714 --> 01:05:29,915
Impossible to move.

353
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,335
You're wasting your time.

354
01:08:02,634 --> 01:08:03,869
What is it?

355
01:08:05,371 --> 01:08:09,242
See here? This is a row
of small vertebrae.

356
01:08:09,641 --> 01:08:13,913
And these flatter sides are where
the ribs would have been attached.

357
01:08:14,581 --> 01:08:16,850
But these ones have
a certain shape,

358
01:08:17,883 --> 01:08:21,887
which tells me they would
have been near the skull.

359
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,255
And that's good?

360
01:08:25,391 --> 01:08:27,994
It would be very good, yes.

361
01:08:37,535 --> 01:08:39,239
That one was special.

362
01:08:42,475 --> 01:08:43,944
I was only 11 years old.

363
01:08:45,311 --> 01:08:49,850
Days it took to dig it out,
clean it.

364
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:52,585
I'd like to see it.

365
01:08:53,085 --> 01:08:54,987
It's in The British Museum

366
01:08:55,021 --> 01:08:58,425
with its fancy made-up name.
Ichthyosaurus.

367
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:09,902
We couldn't keep it. It was a year's
worth of food, rent and clothing.

368
01:09:14,406 --> 01:09:16,141
That's such a poor drawing.

369
01:09:17,709 --> 01:09:19,578
A child's hand.

370
01:09:21,246 --> 01:09:22,414
I like it.

371
01:09:27,018 --> 01:09:29,255
I'm pleased my rock
was worth the work.

372
01:10:02,989 --> 01:10:04,156
You found the head.

373
01:10:09,328 --> 01:10:10,664
Beautiful.

374
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:13,532
We can go tomorrow
to find the rest of it.

375
01:10:14,299 --> 01:10:15,302
Perhaps.

376
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:25,612
I should help.

377
01:10:27,545 --> 01:10:30,549
- Go to bed.
- Won't that wait till the morning?

378
01:10:31,017 --> 01:10:35,121
Father would turn in his grave if he thought
I'd gone to bed without cleaning his tools.

379
01:10:36,355 --> 01:10:37,424
Good night.

380
01:12:40,545 --> 01:12:42,380
Good morning.

381
01:15:39,758 --> 01:15:41,661
- Say it again.
- Hmm.

382
01:15:42,061 --> 01:15:43,329
Please.

383
01:15:46,964 --> 01:15:49,901
There was a young woman
named Sally

384
01:15:49,935 --> 01:15:52,272
Who loved
the occasional dally

385
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:56,374
She sat on the lap
Of a well-endowed chap

386
01:15:56,407 --> 01:15:59,011
And she said, "Ooh,
you're right up my alley."

387
01:18:09,475 --> 01:18:12,977
It was something
like a sea lizard with fins.

388
01:18:13,011 --> 01:18:16,615
- It was probably six feet long.
- Goodness.

389
01:18:16,647 --> 01:18:19,651
It's one of the best
I've found in a long time.

390
01:18:19,685 --> 01:18:21,520
It will
require some thought.

391
01:18:21,553 --> 01:18:23,122
£22?

392
01:18:23,155 --> 01:18:24,889
What price would you
suggest then, sir?

393
01:18:24,923 --> 01:18:26,726
I'm not in the market
for haggling.

394
01:18:28,927 --> 01:18:30,929
It's a stunning example,
isn't it?

395
01:18:30,963 --> 01:18:34,834
In my humble opinion, the physical
effort Miss Anning goes through

396
01:18:34,866 --> 01:18:39,905
to procure such a specimen would make
the price tag seem quite reasonable.

397
01:18:40,673 --> 01:18:43,943
Then there is the painstaking
hours spent working on the specimen

398
01:18:43,976 --> 01:18:46,145
to reveal it
in all its beauty.

399
01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:49,081
- Charlotte...
- On top of this sheer hard work,

400
01:18:49,114 --> 01:18:52,485
let us not forget the
knowledge and years of skill

401
01:18:52,517 --> 01:18:54,020
Miss Anning brings
to her tasks.

402
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:57,256
Without this,
and to the untrained or ill-formed eye,

403
01:18:57,289 --> 01:19:01,560
these would simply be un-investigated
lumps of stone and rock.

404
01:19:01,593 --> 01:19:03,162
Why do you think
the scientific community

405
01:19:03,195 --> 01:19:04,831
places such importance
on this work?

406
01:19:05,397 --> 01:19:09,601
Miss Anning informs us not only
of our past, but of our present.

407
01:19:09,634 --> 01:19:12,637
With all this in mind,
how would you put a price on this, sir?

408
01:19:15,072 --> 01:19:16,142
I see.

409
01:20:18,136 --> 01:20:20,906
Sit down, Mrs. Anning.
It's mushrooms for supper.

410
01:20:20,938 --> 01:20:22,107
Fancy.

411
01:20:22,641 --> 01:20:24,110
Sit down. There's plenty.

412
01:20:25,177 --> 01:20:27,313
The shop won't run itself.

413
01:20:27,346 --> 01:20:28,848
Close it, then.

414
01:20:30,615 --> 01:20:31,984
Oh, I almost forgot.

415
01:20:32,383 --> 01:20:35,320
Correspondence came for you,
Mrs. Murchison.

416
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:10,782
Thank you.

417
01:25:21,405 --> 01:25:22,907
Shh.

418
01:28:01,465 --> 01:28:02,534
It's warm.

419
01:28:05,437 --> 01:28:08,340
Last year at this time we had
snow, and now it's nice.

420
01:30:30,682 --> 01:30:33,185
I had to start
the babies on my own.

421
01:30:40,290 --> 01:30:42,393
I think I might go to my bed.

422
01:31:30,575 --> 01:31:31,610
What are you doing?

423
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:33,946
Pricing up this thing.

424
01:34:20,111 --> 01:34:21,613
We're closed.

425
01:34:22,347 --> 01:34:25,016
It's me, Mary.
Can I come in?

426
01:34:37,695 --> 01:34:39,097
I'm so sorry, Mary.

427
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,002
Molly was...

428
01:34:46,504 --> 01:34:48,140
a perspicacious woman.

429
01:34:49,039 --> 01:34:52,576
Her strength to carry on after
your father died was admirable.

430
01:34:59,717 --> 01:35:01,886
Tell me, have you been
in correspondence

431
01:35:01,919 --> 01:35:03,755
with your Mrs. Murchison
recently?

432
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:07,625
She's clever.

433
01:35:09,759 --> 01:35:11,096
And funny.

434
01:35:11,829 --> 01:35:14,098
I very much
enjoyed her company.

435
01:35:14,865 --> 01:35:17,902
It pleases me you've struck up
a friendship together.

436
01:35:30,248 --> 01:35:34,186
I know I hurt you terribly,
and I'm deeply sorry for that.

437
01:35:42,994 --> 01:35:44,795
I just wasn't sure
I could live up to you.

438
01:35:46,696 --> 01:35:49,534
Or your expectations of me.

439
01:35:52,570 --> 01:35:55,540
A small side step
could curtail it completely.

440
01:35:56,374 --> 01:35:59,578
I wasn't the enemy,
but it often felt like I was.

441
01:36:03,146 --> 01:36:04,181
I tried.

442
01:36:05,249 --> 01:36:06,585
No.

443
01:36:09,887 --> 01:36:11,056
I don't think you did.

444
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:14,226
Not really.

445
01:36:18,094 --> 01:36:21,031
You seemed to do everything
you could to be distant.

446
01:36:31,142 --> 01:36:32,744
Eventually, I just...

447
01:36:37,114 --> 01:36:38,183
stopped trying.

448
01:36:43,954 --> 01:36:47,825
It seems your Mrs. Murchison
has been able to...

449
01:36:48,726 --> 01:36:51,062
unlock something in you
that I couldn't.

450
01:42:10,647 --> 01:42:13,851
Tradesmen's entrance is around the side.
Go all the way back.

451
01:42:14,419 --> 01:42:17,422
I'm here as a guest
of Mrs. Charlotte Murchison.

452
01:42:18,289 --> 01:42:19,324
Miss Anning?

453
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:21,025
Yes.

454
01:42:21,758 --> 01:42:24,596
I beg your pardon, miss.
Please, do come this way.

455
01:42:38,275 --> 01:42:39,576
Please wait here, miss.

456
01:43:00,964 --> 01:43:02,065
Thank you.

457
01:44:23,213 --> 01:44:24,983
That's just the maid.

458
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:27,317
Thank you, Anne.
That will be all.

459
01:44:31,722 --> 01:44:34,258
Oh, Mary! My Mary!

460
01:44:34,290 --> 01:44:37,128
I can't believe you're here.
How was the journey?

461
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,062
I wish you would have let me
send a carriage.

462
01:44:39,096 --> 01:44:42,165
It feels
a very long way from Lyme.

463
01:44:48,605 --> 01:44:51,308
Oh. I had it all planned out.

464
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:53,209
We'd have tea,
and then I'd show you,

465
01:44:53,243 --> 01:44:56,080
but I just don't think I can
wait any longer. Come on!

466
01:45:07,723 --> 01:45:11,061
Close your eyes. You must close your
eyes or it will ruin everything.

467
01:45:11,094 --> 01:45:13,431
I don't think I like surprises.

468
01:45:22,505 --> 01:45:23,708
You can open them.

469
01:45:28,344 --> 01:45:29,379
It's yours.

470
01:45:32,548 --> 01:45:34,084
- Mine?
- Yes.

471
01:45:36,219 --> 01:45:37,387
To stay the night?

472
01:45:37,887 --> 01:45:40,390
Well, yes, but no.

473
01:45:41,191 --> 01:45:42,727
Also yours to move into.

474
01:45:43,127 --> 01:45:46,263
To live here with me.

475
01:45:47,197 --> 01:45:50,368
Here, I thought you could put
your mother's figurines.

476
01:45:50,935 --> 01:45:54,138
And here you can write
your journal.

477
01:45:55,472 --> 01:45:56,840
Such a good light, isn't it?

478
01:45:56,874 --> 01:45:59,177
- But I have my home.
- And in here...

479
01:46:04,313 --> 01:46:07,317
They're for you.
I had them made just for you.

480
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:08,820
Feel this one.

481
01:46:17,361 --> 01:46:18,830
Oh, and one last thing.

482
01:46:25,669 --> 01:46:28,840
My room. So we'll be next
to each other, always.

483
01:46:37,748 --> 01:46:41,218
- You've thought of everything.
- I hope so.

484
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:43,420
I didn't want you
to worry about anything.

485
01:47:01,771 --> 01:47:03,173
Well, say something.

486
01:47:13,217 --> 01:47:15,152
- Sorry. I really shouldn't...
- Mary.

487
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:19,857
I wanted to see my relic in the
British Museum today, so I should...

488
01:47:19,889 --> 01:47:22,192
We'll see it later
once we've settled you in.

489
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:30,767
I feel...
I feel I'm at a great disadvantage.

490
01:47:32,369 --> 01:47:33,404
Pardon?

491
01:47:35,771 --> 01:47:37,340
I feel I've been misled.

492
01:47:38,874 --> 01:47:42,312
- I don't think I have...
- I was invited for a visit.

493
01:47:43,713 --> 01:47:45,748
And now it seems I've been
hoodwinked in some way.

494
01:47:45,781 --> 01:47:46,950
Mary...

495
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:51,254
Why did you not mention
all this in your letter?

496
01:47:53,557 --> 01:47:55,559
I wanted to see
the look on your face.

497
01:47:55,592 --> 01:47:57,561
You presumed I'd be fitted
into your life, here,

498
01:47:57,593 --> 01:47:59,730
like one of my relics
in your fine glass case.

499
01:47:59,762 --> 01:48:01,698
- No, of course not.
- Will you label me, too?

500
01:48:01,731 --> 01:48:05,969
No, that's not what I want.
That's not what I intended.

501
01:48:06,337 --> 01:48:08,438
I want this to be different.

502
01:48:08,472 --> 01:48:09,607
Our different.

503
01:48:10,139 --> 01:48:11,874
This must make
your husband very happy.

504
01:48:11,907 --> 01:48:14,445
- Who cares?
- Oh, please don't make fun of me.

505
01:48:14,477 --> 01:48:17,280
Roddy is content with his life.
Very content.

506
01:48:17,313 --> 01:48:21,584
And because of you, he now has a proper
interest that takes up most of his time.

507
01:48:21,618 --> 01:48:24,621
You make it sound so neat,
like I planned it.

508
01:48:24,655 --> 01:48:26,389
Of course not.

509
01:48:27,022 --> 01:48:29,826
Please,
why are you doing this?

510
01:48:30,294 --> 01:48:33,331
I don't want to go back
to the life I had before you.

511
01:48:33,897 --> 01:48:36,866
What about my life, Charlotte?
My work?

512
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:41,504
I can't bear to think of you suffering
out on those beaches in all weathers.

513
01:48:41,538 --> 01:48:44,607
And now you'll be free
to do your important work,

514
01:48:44,641 --> 01:48:46,744
your scientific work.

515
01:48:48,911 --> 01:48:50,280
You don't understand me.

516
01:48:59,489 --> 01:49:00,657
No!

517
01:49:04,061 --> 01:49:07,565
Your proposition makes me feel like
some fancy bird in a gilded cage.

518
01:49:10,901 --> 01:49:12,903
I need to find lodgings
for tonight.

519
01:49:16,505 --> 01:49:17,874
I wish you'd told me before.

520
01:49:19,942 --> 01:49:21,811
I could have saved
the boat fare.

521
01:49:21,844 --> 01:49:23,981
Mary... Mary!

522
01:52:36,465 --> 01:52:41,465

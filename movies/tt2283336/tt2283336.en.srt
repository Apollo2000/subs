1
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,677
God, do I hate Paris.

2
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,719
Not to worry.
Probably won't be around much longer.

3
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,555
I've been waiting a long time for this.

4
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,554
I guess what... What I'm trying to say is:
Lisa, will you mar...?

5
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,439
We're with Tower security.

6
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,989
We're sorry,
but you're not supposed to be here.

7
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,753
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

8
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,877
So? She say yes?

9
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,191
- I haven't asked yet.
- He hasn't asked yet.

10
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, well, that's a terrible shame, isn't it?

11
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,351
Because that blinking light back there

12
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,399
means there's been a breach in Portal 2.

13
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,994
Which means, in a few minutes,

14
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,311
the most vile creatures
in the entire universe,

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,518
the Hive, are gonna consume
every last one of us from the inside out.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,353
I don't understand.

17
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,714
All will be explained if you look right...

18
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
here.

19
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,753
The Tower was closed for repairs.
Ask her on the way down.

20
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,630
This way, please.

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Thank you.

22
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,076
Mind the gap.

23
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
Right. Shall we?

24
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,755
Let's do this.

25
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,716
- Hey, guys.
- Who the hell are you?

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,992
Ask her again down on the ground.

27
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,110
Ah, there you are.

28
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,716
Yeah. All right.
Let's try this again, shall we?

29
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,720
So, what's the play here?

30
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,517
We've been in this situation before.

31
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,512
We've never faced the Hive before.

32
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,114
They've never faced us.

33
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,429
Always remember:

34
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,718
The universe has a way of leading you
to where you're supposed to be

35
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,996
at the moment
you're supposed to be there.

36
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,311
Sometimes the universe gets it wrong.

37
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,917
"Let's have some action.

38
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,753
I want some asses wiggling.

39
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,752
I want some perfection."

40
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,516
Get my three-wood.

41
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,472
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay, okay.

42
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Careful.

43
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,069
Oh, my God!

44
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,590
- Oh, my God. Baby.
- What?

45
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,313
That wasn't no animal, okay?

46
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,631
It was a... It was a...

47
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,475
I ain't never seen nothing like that before.
It was like a creature.

48
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,790
What? Harold, call the police.

49
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,076
- The who?
- The police. Call the police!

50
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,076
That was fast.

51
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,636
Good evening, folks.
We're from Animal Control.

52
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,110
- You say you saw something?
- We haven't called you yet.

53
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,237
Are we in any danger?
Does it have rabies?

54
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,232
Whatever that was,
it wasn't a regular animal.

55
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,391
- It was like a...
- Yes, the creature you saw was

56
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,314
an unlicensed Tarantian
from Andromeda II.

57
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,834
Very rare, very dangerous.

58
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,752
- I'm sorry, what?
- A Tarantian.

59
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,399
I know. He looks cute now.

60
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,199
- Tarantian?
- But when they hit puberty,

61
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,317
they turn into real monsters.

62
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,991
Don't be scared. It's okay.

63
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,117
Is there anyone else in the house?

64
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,192
Just our daughter. She's sleeping.

65
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,160
A raccoon.
Yeah, that's your problem, folks.

66
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,357
Just make sure those trash can lids

67
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,757
are on nice and tight,
and we were never here.

68
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,319
Maybe we should go check on Molly.

69
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,477
We've gotta get you out of here.

70
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Come on.

71
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,997
It's okay.

72
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,756
I'm your friend. I'm Molly. Go on.

73
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,194
Molly.

74
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,351
<i>Kabla nakshulin.</i>

75
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,198
<i>Kabla nakshulin.</i>

76
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,477
Well, Molly, you've scored excellent
or above in every area.

77
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,070
Fitness, deductive reasoning, logic,

78
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,640
weapons training.

79
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,951
Just one problem.

80
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,713
You didn't check a box.

81
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,996
For your preferred division.
Everyone has to check a box.

82
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,070
Yeah, I made my own box

83
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,154
for the division that has no box.

84
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,998
You know, the division
where they wear black suits

85
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,834
and deal with the guys from...

86
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,196
up there.

87
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,633
You mean, Accounting?

88
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,836
No, like...

89
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,792
Yeah, still...

90
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,519
Accounting.

91
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,034
That should fix the glitch.

92
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,794
- And remember, we care.
- You're good to go.

93
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,832
And just remember, we care.

94
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,110
Look for the icon marked
"advanced extensions."

95
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,475
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Click on it.

96
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,438
<i>Which icon? There's a bunch...</i>

97
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,796
- Thirteenth icon from the left.
<i>- Whose left?</i>

98
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,316
- Your left.
<i>- Oh, sorry.</i>

99
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,471
<i>- I got it now.</i>
- Okay, got it?

100
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,471
<i>Yeah, I got it.</i>

101
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,596
<i>Perfect.</i>

102
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
<i>Are you still there?</i>

103
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,558
<i>- Hello? Help me. What's going on?</i>
- Oh, no.

104
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,712
Nothing. Let me just run
a little diagnostic on my end,

105
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,917
and I will be back to you.
No, it won't take long.

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,400
Not long at all. Okay.

107
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,115
What the f...?

108
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,271
- This is perplexing.
- Is it...?

109
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Is it...?

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,469
A-L-I-E-N-S?

111
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,634
I don't know why you always insist
on whispering and spelling that.

112
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,638
Finally decided to show up, huh?

113
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,920
Oh, my God.

114
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,391
All I have to do is figure out trajectory
and I am in.

115
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,358
- I'm back. Okay, try this.
<i>- Hi.</i>

116
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,477
- Unplug it, plug it back in.
<i>- Okay. All right.</i>

117
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,517
- And remember, we care.
<i>- Hello?</i>

118
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I have to go.

119
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,640
- Jimmy's coming back to get the kids.
- Yes.

120
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,629
Okay. Let's see where you are now.

121
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,477
<i>Welcome back, Professor Armitage.</i>

122
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,795
Oh, you tricky one.

123
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,349
I don't think you're a meteor, are you?

124
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,992
Nope, I think you are
an unauthorized landing.

125
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,115
This is it.

126
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,919
It's all happening.

127
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,040
See you soon, Jimmy.

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,799
Right here, right here.

129
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,792
Right here.

130
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,718
- Hey, hey!
- Hey.

131
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,838
Please keep the meter running.
I'll pay you extra.

132
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
What...?

133
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,317
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, Jimmy.

134
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,232
What are you doing back on Earth?

135
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,596
Hey, this is...? This is Earth?

136
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,275
- My bad, guys. Come on.
- Tell it to O back at HQ.

137
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,592
- I just want to see my kids.
- Get this ship out of here!

138
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,956
I'll escort our Zamporian friend back.

139
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,793
- Don't lose them.
- What?

140
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,156
- I'm on it. On it.
- Go, go, go! Go!

141
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,319
Hey, did they bring in
that Zamporian yet?

142
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,198
Came in minutes ahead of you.

143
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,114
The guy tried to sneak in
behind a Perseid meteor shower.

144
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,271
Amateur hour. Am I right?

145
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,160
Right as rain.

146
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,315
Rain don't lie.

147
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,113
Sheesh, talk about amateur hour.
Hey, you gonna call this in or what?

148
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,755
Code Black.

149
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,631
<i>Unauthorized visitor.</i>

150
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,916
<i>Lockdown protocol engaged</i>

151
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,435
<i>in three, two, one.</i>

152
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,394
- All right, who's she working for?
- She claims to be working alone.

153
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,558
A random civilian simply waltzes in
off the high street.

154
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,040
I don't think so.

155
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Neuralyze her.

156
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,712
No, no, no. Don't.

157
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,076
I know what that thing is. Please.

158
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,879
<i>Hang on. Hang on.</i>

159
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,674
She had an experience.

160
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,397
It erased my parents' memories,
but it didn't take mine.

161
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,678
So my whole life,
everyone's called me crazy.

162
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,234
They said that I needed therapy,

163
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,314
which, okay, admittedly, I did,
but not for this.

164
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,152
Did she really hack
into the Hubble Telescope

165
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,074
to look at Andromeda II
and we didn't catch her?

166
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,356
In the old days, we'd have hired her.

167
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,476
It took me 20 years to find you,
plus or minus.

168
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,673
How many people can say that?

169
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,838
I found you.

170
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,915
So you found us.
You proved you're not crazy.

171
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,957
You win the "I'm Not Crazy" badge.
Now what?

172
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,350
- I want in.
- We don't hire. We recruit.

173
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,796
Then I'd like to be recruited.

174
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,191
I'm going to need more...

175
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,318
but would you mind giving me
one good reason?

176
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,153
Because I'm smart.

177
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,594
I'm motivated.

178
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,993
I look good in black. I'm...

179
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,230
Boring me.

180
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,516
Because I have absolutely
no life whatsoever.

181
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,550
I have nothing.
I have no dog, no cat, definitely no chill.

182
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,155
I have nothing
that I couldn't happily walk away from,

183
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,391
which makes me perfect for this job.

184
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,518
Well, you're certainly suitably tragic.

185
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,354
No love? No relationships?

186
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,636
They just distract you
from what's important.

187
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,996
Oh, really? And what's important?

188
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,992
The truth of the universe.

189
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,477
I wanna know everything.
I wanna know how it all works.

190
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,834
You really think a black suit is going
to solve all your problems?

191
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,072
No, but it looks damn good on you.

192
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,670
That's true.

193
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,832
<i>From this moment, you will conform
to the identity we give you.</i>

194
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,951
<i>You will dress only
in MIB Special Services attire.</i>

195
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,437
<i>You have been trained in the use
of MIB-sanctioned technology,</i>

196
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,120
<i>vehicles and weaponry.</i>

197
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,109
<i>You will not stand out in any way.</i>

198
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,552
<i>You are no longer part of the system.</i>

199
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,394
<i>You do not exist.</i>

200
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,516
Check, please.

201
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,553
We are above the system.

202
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,111
Over it, beyond it. We are them.
We are they. We are the Men in Black.

203
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,998
The "Men" in Black?

204
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,912
Don't. Don't start.

205
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,311
I've had the conversation.
They didn't seem to be able to let it go.

206
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,790
It's a process. Attachment issue, I think.

207
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,678
There's your first assignment.

208
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,597
Okay. When do I get my...?

209
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,718
It's called a neuralyzer.
You don't just get it, you earn it.

210
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,719
You've been accepted
for a probationary period.

211
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,599
Impress me, and we'll see about the:

212
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Okay.

213
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,554
You're a fan of the truth,
aren't you, Agent M?

214
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
I like it.

215
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,518
I think we may have
a problem in London.

216
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,278
Wow, that is smooth.

217
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,511
Let's keep them coming, shall we?
Another round.

218
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,193
So can I just say how much
I'm liking this place?

219
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,158
It's formal but not too stuffy.

220
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,675
Classic, but still kind of stylish.

221
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,753
Makes it
a very <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> kind of vibe.

222
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,274
I'm kidding.

223
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Sort of.

224
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,752
Or is it mostly
just the lethal high-stakes gambling?

225
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,672
Thank you very much.

226
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,116
Would you look at that?
Straight to the ace, gentlemen.

227
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
That's me again.

228
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,634
Let's talk business, shall we?

229
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,077
I can move this stuff.

230
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,277
Who do I speak with
about getting a lot more of it?

231
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Because I'm in.

232
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
You're not.

233
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,400
You see, I have a very strict
"no Men in Black" policy.

234
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,310
Oh, God. I don't blame you.

235
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,551
Who'd want
those assholes coming in here?

236
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,792
Men in Black.
The Morons in Black, if you ask me.

237
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,712
What a bunch of dicks. Am I right?

238
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,191
All it takes is one bad apple
to spoil any environment...

239
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,600
Stop it, guys.

240
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,560
I am MIB, you Cerulian scum.

241
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,758
And FYI, your little club here sucks.

242
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,797
You're gonna give me everything:

243
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,634
suppliers, sellers, your whole network.

244
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,795
Your luck run out. You're already dead.

245
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,151
Only one person here has the antidote.
Emily, sweetheart.

246
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,277
Please, I'll...
I'll give you whatever you want.

247
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Please.

248
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,000
Anything you want.

249
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,839
Anything I want?

250
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,834
<i>The express train to London has arrived.</i>

251
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,709
<i>With continuing service to Paris,
Stockholm,</i>

252
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,315
<i>Milan, Rome, Madrid.</i>

253
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,270
Caught him in the locker room.
I knew that kid was neuralyzing himself.

254
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,512
I told him, "Do that too much
and you'll go blind."

255
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,431
Right?

256
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,920
Who could go for a nosh?

257
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,430
I'd like a nice pastrami sandwich.

258
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,796
With lots of melted cheese too.

259
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,280
<i>Now arriving:
express train from New York.</i>

260
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,118
<i>Last call for Flight 2112
to the Cat's Eye Nebula.</i>

261
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,919
<i>Welcome, Agent M.</i>

262
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,913
<i>Please report to New Agent Orientation.</i>

263
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,040
<i>Access granted, Agent M.</i>

264
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,240
<i>...every hour from Gate 12.</i>

265
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,996
Excuse me, ma'am.

266
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,320
It's never who you think it is.

267
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,998
Oh, no. That one makes sense.

268
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,199
So you're the one who found us.

269
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,159
Yes, I am.

270
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,755
I'm T. High T.

271
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,399
Oh, yeah. You're...

272
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,437
- I run this little circus.
- Yeah.

273
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,558
- Welcome, M.
- It's nice to meet you, sir.

274
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,200
O told me to expect some great things.

275
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,154
- And great things shall you get.
- Good.

276
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,435
Right through there.

277
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,919
- Hi, you.
- Wait, wait, wait! Don't touch him!

278
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
Oh, God.

279
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,239
- I got him, I got him.
- You guys...

280
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,800
I got him. I got him.

281
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,120
"Change it, change it."

282
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
All right, buddy.

283
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,357
All right. Try this.

284
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,873
Oh, careful. You break it, you buy it.

285
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,911
Keep it. Keep it.

286
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
On me.

287
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,275
We need to see the queen.

288
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Yes.

289
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,710
You have visitors.

290
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,394
State your business with the queen.

291
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,960
We need someone to die.

292
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,880
As clearly stated in Section 6C
of the Treaty of Andromeda II,

293
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,440
we do not kill Jababians

294
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,631
nor participate in the murder thereof.

295
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,753
This is nonnegotiable.

296
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,037
Well, it's slightly negotiable.

297
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Morning.

298
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,518
I'm in the market for a useless, old,
broken-down machine. What do you got?

299
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,040
You're not gonna get a rise out of me, H.
It's the Imperial with the red tab.

300
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,793
Do try to keep up.

301
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Thank you, Charlie.

302
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,597
That's the old portal depot.

303
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,115
Site of the First Great Alien Migration.

304
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,991
Wait, so Eiffel was an MIB agent?

305
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,236
One of the first.

306
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,280
He helped so many intergalactic refugees
seeking protection here on Earth.

307
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,477
If you look closely,
you can see my grandma

308
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,994
and my grandpa in that picture.

309
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,400
So beautiful.

310
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,632
- Here you are, dear.
- Thank you.

311
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,873
What's up with that guy?

312
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,911
Nerlene!

313
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,110
Sorry.

314
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,510
He's just so yummy.

315
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,910
- Who is he?
- H.

316
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,878
Only the best agent in the building.

317
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,236
He saved the world once
with nothing but his wits

318
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,630
and a Series-7 De-Atomizer.

319
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,032
He saved the world?

320
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,236
From what?

321
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,358
The Hive.

322
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,716
Hey, Guy, do me a favor.

323
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,837
- Handle my calls.
- Oh, love to.

324
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,912
Where are you going?

325
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,354
To do some homework.

326
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,830
An awful, terrible incident in Marrakesh.

327
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,754
The North Africa office is investigating.

328
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,240
And in other business,

329
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,472
H has decided to grace us
with his presence after all.

330
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,029
- Apologies, sir. I was working late.
- So was I.

331
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,112
Cleaning up after your mess.
Thank you for that.

332
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,034
Oh, you should've seen the mess
I was cleaning up this morning.

333
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,157
It was a totally unsanctioned op, sir,

334
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,835
requiring two containment units
and a full neuralyzer squad.

335
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,152
About that, I prefer to look at this
from a macro point of view,

336
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,199
not get bogged down in the details.
The bad guy's dead, so you know...

337
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,954
Take a seat, please. One last item.

338
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,079
A member of the Jababian royal family

339
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,198
has a layover on his way to Centaurus A.

340
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,436
Vungus the Ugly.

341
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,354
Inherited the title.

342
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,475
Believe it or not, Vungus here is
the looker in the crowd.

343
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,040
Holograms always add 10 pounds.

344
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,238
Jababian society doesn't allow

345
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,915
for certain indiscretions.

346
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,192
In short, he wants
to be shown a good time.

347
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,956
We could say no,
but Jababian mining vessels

348
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,271
would grind us into galactic dust.

349
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,000
Some irony there, sir,
if you think that we used to...

350
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,912
protect Earth
from the scum of the universe.

351
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,798
Now it seems we're protecting the scum.

352
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,395
Actually, that's why
it would be right up your street.

353
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,119
Your cup of tea, H.

354
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,476
I know Vungus.
He doesn't really drink tea.

355
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,837
He prefers vodka, tequila, hand sanitizer,
sometimes all at once.

356
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,593
We woke up handcuffed to a horse.

357
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,194
- What, H?
- Pipe down.

358
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,277
- What?
- Sorry. Sincere apologies.

359
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,990
You will be his chaperone.
In fact, he specifically asked for you.

360
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,790
Absolutely, hopefully we don't end up
handcuffed to a horse again.

361
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,791
Please.

362
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,157
- I'll have him home by midnight.
- Good boy. If you will.

363
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,749
- "Good boy. If you will."
- "Good man," I think he said.

364
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,315
- Keep Daddy happy, yeah?
- We're like this.

365
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,393
- You look after <i>Papi</i> so well.
- You're so jealous.

366
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,551
<i>- Papi's</i> fancy boy.
- You wish you had a <i>papi.</i>

367
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Hello.

368
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,120
- Sorry.
- Hi.

369
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,992
Hey. Nope, I'm awake. It's all right.

370
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,635
Just catching up on my daily meditation.

371
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,393
I have been meaning to try that.

372
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,153
I read that it dramatically improves

373
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,277
- mitochondrial energy production.
- Yep, yep.

374
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,033
No, it absolutely does.

375
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,998
My mitochondrial energy's
through the roof.

376
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,116
- Have we met before?
- No. Agent M.

377
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,398
I heard you were on the Vungus meet,
and I wanted to offer my assistance.

378
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,392
I'm a bit of a Jababian wonk.

379
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,235
Language, culture, politics, fashion.

380
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,960
Anyway, I compiled a dossier
for you to read.

381
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,078
Oh, a dossier. I love a good dossier.

382
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,117
The thing is... Ask around.

383
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,510
I work alone. Ask anyone around here.

384
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,274
Did you know that Jababians
are claircognizant empaths,

385
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,033
which means
that they can read your mind?

386
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,355
And your cards.

387
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,400
- Well, they do have a tell.
- What's that?

388
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,234
Subdermal spots
on the underside of their arms

389
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,913
- change color.
- Good to know.

390
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,957
Thank you for your offer. I'm good.

391
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,278
Okay. Message understood.

392
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,192
I will leave you to your...

393
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
meditation.

394
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Thank you.

395
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,714
Do you know what your tell is?

396
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,233
You snore when you meditate.

397
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,119
On second thought,
maybe I could use some backup.

398
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,955
I was thinking, for the op,
I can take the perimeter,

399
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,760
- and you make the approach to Vungus.
- Yes, good.

400
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,436
- Okay.
- The thing is, with this particular club...

401
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,671
everybody just wants to do
their own thing.

402
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,320
Aliens wanna look like humans,
humans wanna look like aliens,

403
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,073
so we may need to loosen up a bit.

404
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,635
Maybe we lose the tie first, yeah?

405
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,429
Pop a couple of buttons
and not look so stiff.

406
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,830
We don't want to advertise
our current profession,

407
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,996
if you know what I mean.

408
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,436
"Look, it's the Men in Black.
Aliens, get down!"

409
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,796
- I get it.
- Don't do that. Yeah? Good.

410
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,395
Great. Perfect.
How about me? How do I look?

411
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,839
I would just...

412
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,080
- Do you mind if I...?
- What?

413
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,230
Coming in.

414
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,916
It's a fine line between club casual
and the saddest man on Earth.

415
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Thank you.

416
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,879
- Yeah. Shall we?
- I thought that we were here.

417
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,633
We are.

418
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,439
Entrance for special guests.

419
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,277
Step on it, would you, Freddie?

420
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,555
You got it, H.

421
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,552
Yeah, okay. Wasn't expecting that.

422
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,192
The Vungus Among Us!

423
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,318
H-Bomb!

424
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,119
- V-Go! V-Go!
- Yeah, yeah!

425
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,714
Yeah!

426
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,837
Look at you. You've lost weight.

427
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,833
What have you done to your hair?
You've changed it. Looks fantastic.

428
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,957
- Oh, I...
- I barely recognize you.

429
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,195
Sorry. M, this is Vungus. Vungus, M.

430
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,239
Hello, M.

431
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,800
So nice to meet you.

432
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,917
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Highly redacted, of course.

433
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,756
Such a charmer. He says...

434
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,309
- he thinks you're hot.
- He thinks I'm what? Sorry?

435
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,717
It's a rough translation.
Probably works better on Ja... Jababia,

436
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,269
but you know that
since you speak fluent Jababian.

437
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,913
Of course. I was just trying
to find the words to articulate

438
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,640
how incredibly eye-catching you are.

439
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,757
Well, that he is.

440
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,116
M knows everything
there is to know about Jababia.

441
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,271
I wouldn't say "everything."
Always more to learn.

442
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,919
It's like a fetish.

443
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,673
That implies something sexual.

444
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,000
- It's definitely not.
- It is.

445
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,517
It's always like, "Oh, Jababia this,
Jababia that, Jababia, Jababia, Jababia!"

446
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,798
- Yeah, baby!
- I knew the two of you would hit it off.

447
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,678
Have a dance, okay? M loves to dance.

448
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,672
She's a wonderful dancer.
I'll get us drinks.

449
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,558
You're still a vodka cranberry guy?

450
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,960
You know it.

451
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Okay. Okay.

452
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,594
M, please.

453
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,990
Come, sit next to Vungus.

454
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,992
I promise, I don't bite.

455
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,719
Okay, just give me one sec.

456
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,953
Four vodka cranberries.

457
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,714
It's all right. I'll get this one.
Put it on the company card.

458
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,359
Little tip: expense everything.

459
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,033
Hey, quick question, no big deal.

460
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,271
Are you pimping me out to Vungus?

461
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,555
What? No.

462
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,394
What the hell would give you
that impression?

463
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,719
Hello.

464
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,435
- Oh, I don't know. That?
- Oh, well...

465
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,113
Better not look at that.

466
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,113
If you want to use me as alien bait,
just let me know next time.

467
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,760
- I don't like to be lied to.
- What, like pretending

468
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,230
to be an expert in something you're not?

469
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,039
We're in the lying business.

470
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,555
- Are we?
- Jababians are prickly.

471
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,960
We want them to be happy.

472
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,316
So they don't destroy our planet
and everything on it.

473
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,800
And that is the mission.

474
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,136
- If you're not down with the mission...
- I'm down with the mission,

475
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,391
but I'm not fornicating with the Jababian.

476
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,233
That's not what I asked you to do.

477
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,472
So how long you here for, buddy?

478
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,754
Vungus go home tomorrow.

479
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Tomorrow?

480
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,357
We better make it a good one, huh?

481
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,233
I came to talk, H. We need to speak.

482
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,032
Talky, shmalky. I want to see you dance.

483
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,192
Come on. Come on, I know...
I know this is your jam.

484
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,396
Get out here. M, come on.

485
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,076
Oh, no, I'm just gonna...
I like to butt-dance.

486
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,195
Hey, I need to talk to you
about something.

487
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,557
If it's about that night in Beirut,
I deleted the photos. Promise.

488
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,109
No, not Beirut. Just...

489
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,156
- H?
- Yeah?

490
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,159
- Twelve o'clock.
- You're damn right it is. Night is young.

491
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,269
Listen to me, H.

492
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,158
This is serious!

493
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,630
You're the only one
that Vungus can trust.

494
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,234
Well, feeling's mutual.

495
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,514
What happened to you?

496
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,877
Nothing. What happened to you?
Why are you so serious?

497
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,633
- Relax. Ow! Yeah.
- H.

498
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,071
You all right, buddy?
What's wrong? You don't look so good.

499
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,198
- You okay?
- Vungus not feel so good.

500
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,112
Vodka cranberry sure pack a punch.

501
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,593
Let's get his car and get him out of here.

502
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,679
Okay. Get you off to bed.

503
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,672
Let's get you in here. All right.

504
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,077
There you are, buddy. In you go.

505
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,550
Watch your head. Okay. All right.

506
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,712
Now, sleep it off, okay?
I'll speak to you in the morning. Hydrate.

507
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,673
- Shouldn't we call it in?
- Oh, God, no.

508
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,114
The paperwork is a nightmare.

509
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,913
But Vungus didn't look too good.

510
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,639
He didn't look too good before, but...

511
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,350
Trust me, I've seen him way worse.
This one time in Istanbul...

512
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,589
Help me.

513
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,111
- MIB. Freeze!
- On the ground.

514
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,600
- Hands up.
- Palms down.

515
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,840
- Palms down.
- Hands up.

516
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,629
Which do you want to go with?

517
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,679
I'm fine with either. We have
to come up with something consistent.

518
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,991
- Do you want palms down?
- If you don't mind.

519
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,920
- Palms down.
- Palms down.

520
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Good.

521
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
What the...?

522
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,830
That is not good.

523
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
Run!

524
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
M!

525
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,633
- They are coming!
- Petrol cap. Go.

526
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,436
We need more firepower.
Side-view mirror.

527
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,037
What do you want me to do,
throw it at them?

528
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,913
I haven't seen that before.

529
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,953
I don't think this is doing anything.

530
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,440
Come on.

531
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,879
Exhaust pipe. Go!

532
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,756
Come on!

533
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,838
Now this is more like it.

534
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,040
Right.

535
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Hurry!

536
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,517
Go to Vungus. I'll cover you.

537
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,000
H! A little help here!

538
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,800
No. Not H.

539
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,872
He has changed.

540
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,236
I could feel it.

541
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,834
I have to know...

542
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,875
if I can trust you.

543
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,439
Now I'm pissed off.

544
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,590
Hide this.

545
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,793
Something is wrong in Men in Black.

546
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,871
What? Vungus, what is this?

547
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,679
It's the only thing that can protect you.

548
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Come on!

549
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,071
Where's your fancy dance moves now?

550
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,275
What the...?

551
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,671
Keep your eyes on. It's not safe.

552
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,831
Eyes on! Eyes on!

553
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,070
Two targets!

554
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
How is he?

555
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,670
He's gone.

556
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,238
Guys, back up a little bit, all right?

557
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,429
Outdone yourself here, mate.

558
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,000
- Well done. Well done.
- Thank you.

559
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,276
Fill me in. What happened, huh?

560
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,232
We were attacked, clearly, C.

561
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,600
- Right.
- By I don't know what.

562
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,639
The suspects, they did this
with their bare hands.

563
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,633
- Turned solid into liquid, then back again.
- What?

564
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,676
- Why's she here?
- She...

565
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,591
- She is
- She is

566
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,256
- walking you through the crime scene.
- walking you through the crime scene.

567
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,636
No, no. She is a probationary agent,

568
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,519
so she is not here at all, okay?

569
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,389
I think you'll find that she clearly is here
because I can see her.

570
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,880
- Backing you up.
- Thank you.

571
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,680
It was a figure of speech, but fine.
You are in so much trouble.

572
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,911
Oh, my God. You had one job.

573
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,957
You had one very simple job:

574
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,191
to take some lizard slimeball
out for a few drinks.

575
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,431
- That was it.
- Not a "lizard slimeball."

576
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,398
- A friend of mine.
- Oh, no.

577
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,834
Yeah. Sorry about that.

578
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,752
He was a reptilian slimeball.

579
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,400
He's now dead because of you.
Who was with him when he died?

580
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,709
- I was.
- Who...?

581
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,399
Okay, good. And did he say anything
that might explain why he was killed?

582
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,960
Anything at all? Come on.

583
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,549
No. Not a thing.

584
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,476
- So just to recap...
- No point.

585
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,871
A high-ranking member of the Jababian
royal family dies on your watch,

586
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,475
murdered by assailants
that you can't identify,

587
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,917
for reasons that you cannot begin
to fathom. Is that about right?

588
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,993
I switched off the moment
you started talking. I don't know.

589
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,400
Why don't you bugger off.

590
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,113
- Okay, mate. Thank you.
- Yeah.

591
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,510
- I'll piss off, to the office.
- Where you belong.

592
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,514
To have a little word with High T,
who will not save you this time.

593
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,877
We'll be fine. Okay? Don't worry.

594
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,520
This is... We'll be fine.

595
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,191
Yeah?

596
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,556
Yes. Yes. Understood.

597
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,670
Yeah... Indeed.

598
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,160
Yes.

599
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,277
Yes. Yes.

600
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,920
Thank you.

601
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,310
Let me assure you,
we will deal with this

602
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,357
in the strongest possible terms.

603
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,110
The Jababians want your heads.

604
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,511
Quite literally. Both heads,
sent by diplomatic pouch.

605
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,956
Okay...

606
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,429
Morning, sir. I have the forensics report
that you asked for.

607
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,556
Thank you.

608
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,120
Well, this is troubling.

609
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,270
Very troubling.

610
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,880
These are our suspects.

611
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,036
A species called Dyadnum.

612
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,114
From a binary star system
in the constellation Draco.

613
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,558
Draco, that's Hive territory.
The entire sector fell years ago.

614
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,429
The Dyads' DNA...

615
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,432
are riddled with Hive mutations.

616
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,116
As we all know, the Hive doesn't
just destroy their enemies,

617
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,237
they subsume them.

618
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,959
Take them over from within.

619
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,475
Whoever these two were,
they're part of the Hive now.

620
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,110
Yes, but why would the Hive send them
all this way to kill a Jababian royal?

621
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,391
You knew Vungus better than anyone.
Did he indicate why he was here?

622
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,800
Did he want something from us?

623
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,758
- No, he seemed pretty normal, happy.
- Sir.

624
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,560
This whole thing is a fiasco. It's a farrago.

625
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,554
And a failure of this magnitude
requires immediate invokement of...

626
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,316
Article 13.

627
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,313
Don't be a dick. Who says "farrago"?

628
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,959
What is Article 13?

629
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,874
Immediate termination, followed by...

630
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,519
- neuralyzation.
- Wait a second.

631
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,915
- Wait.
- No.

632
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,400
Is that your answer to everything?

633
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,960
- Put that away!
- Glasses off.

634
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,158
- Sir, you can't.
- Give me one good reason why not.

635
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,879
Because it's...

636
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,633
what we were talking about.

637
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,953
- Because...
- Because...

638
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,350
if you erase us,
you will never know the truth.

639
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,079
- The truth.
- Come on, they're stalling.

640
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,396
- Say the word. I'll do it.
- Put it away.

641
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,830
M, go ahead. Explain yourself.

642
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,760
Well, sir...

643
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,959
if you think about it, really think about it...

644
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,280
Vungus...

645
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,671
how many people really knew
that he was here?

646
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,712
The people in this room.

647
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,960
And perhaps a dozen high-level agents.

648
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,839
If those were the only people that knew
where Vungus would be

649
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,391
and we assume that Vungus didn't leak
his own location to the killers,

650
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,239
doesn't that mean that it was someone...

651
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,589
inside MIB?

652
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,036
A mole, sir, inside these very walls.

653
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,351
Sir, they're making this up
as they go along.

654
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,715
What do you mean, "a mole"?

655
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,474
In the history of the company,
there's never been a leak. "Mole."

656
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,296
- Something a mole would say.
- Don't be absurd.

657
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,551
- Classic mole talk.
- Sounds like Mole 101.

658
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,199
Enough.

659
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,078
If we've been compromised,

660
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,120
it puts every citizen on this planet,
both human and alien, at risk.

661
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,790
- C. Track down these killers.
- Sir.

662
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,830
- Find the killers, we find the mole.
- Will do, sir.

663
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,920
Dismissed.

664
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,433
M, it appears you're
as sharp as advertised.

665
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,717
Work the case with C.

666
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,996
And get Weapons Department
started on something

667
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,117
that can neutralize these Dyads.

668
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,800
Yes, sir.

669
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,920
Sharp indeed she is, sir.

670
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,151
I assume you'll want me
overseeing the case?

671
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,597
- A sort of... Sort of...
- I'm finished covering for you, H.

672
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,276
You need me on this case, sir.
I've dealt with the Hive before.

673
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,397
With nothing but my wits
and my Series 7...

674
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,679
No. He dealt with the Hive before.

675
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,077
And I don't know
where the hell he has gone!

676
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,880
I actually used to think
you could lead this place.

677
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,599
I was wrong about you.

678
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,396
We're done here.

679
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,029
That's an order.

680
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,390
Look, you weren't wrong about me, sir.

681
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,349
You saw something in me once.
It's still there.

682
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,230
And I apologize for letting you down.

683
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,520
Give me another chance
and I'll fix this. I promise you.

684
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,233
I don't think it's just a blade.

685
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,711
- Looks like it carries some poison.
- I know what you're talking about.

686
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,711
- Wait.
- Sorry, mate.

687
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,917
High T wants me to run point on this one.

688
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,275
What? I don't believe you.

689
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,919
I don't like it any better than you,

690
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,878
but he kept going on
about relying on me,

691
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,111
needing our top agent, that sort of thing.

692
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,736
I don't make the rules.
Take it up with him.

693
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,913
M, he's keen for you to shadow me.
All right? "Learn from the best," he said.

694
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,959
Little on-the-job training,
if you will. Yeah?

695
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:57,917
Come on.

696
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,310
- Are you going or you staying?
- Yeah, I'll go.

697
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,400
- Right, well...
- Okay.

698
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,671
- Come on.
- H?

699
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,400
Thanks for that.

700
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,756
I'm sick of you.

701
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,830
Okay.

702
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,991
- What's the actual truth?
- You tell me.

703
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,311
For someone who hates lying,
that was incredible.

704
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,278
- I wasn't...
- It was electric up there.

705
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,352
The way we played off
each other back and forth.

706
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,397
- I was riffing.
- A mole inside the MIB.

707
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,039
It's genius. I wish I thought of it.

708
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,440
I discovered a possible truth.

709
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,711
I mean, think about it.
It would explain a lot.

710
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,280
What have you got so far?

711
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,756
I was about to run
a molecular deconstruction

712
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,036
on the substance and cross-reference
with all toxins.

713
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,272
- Good idea.
- Just a little science. I wouldn't do that.

714
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,396
I know what that is.

715
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,518
That killed a 300-pound Jababian,
so I wouldn't get recreational with it.

716
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,239
That is Zephos, pure grade.

717
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,073
The wrong amount will kill you instantly.

718
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,152
The right amount will
keep you dancing shirtless

719
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,630
on a nightclub table in Monaco
for 17 hours straight.

720
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,757
So much information.
Always so much information.

721
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,950
It's what I've heard.

722
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,317
There's only one place in the world
where they know how to mix it. Let's go.

723
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,075
You coming?
World's not gonna save itself.

724
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,470
Are you saying that you need me
to save the world?

725
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Thought so.

726
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,072
You'll see that a lot around here.

727
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,551
It's a Cromulian tag.

728
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,479
In their galaxy,
a symbol for hope or annihilation.

729
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,557
There's still some debate
around what exactly.

730
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,359
Actually, it's harmony.

731
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,915
But on Earth, it means
we're entering an MIB safe haven.

732
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,390
- How do you know that?
- It's in the handbook.

733
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,696
Don't believe everything you read.

734
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,677
- That is myjob.
- And myjob is what?

735
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,399
- Hang out here and shut up?
- Yes.

736
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,119
You shut up. That is your job.

737
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,277
Well, look who it is. Nasr.

738
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,637
You know the rules: no visible alien tech
anywhere on the street.

739
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,800
Cover the bike up
before I have to give you a ticket.

740
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,309
H? It is really you?

741
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,517
Of course it's me. Who else could it be?

742
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,954
- Hey, Bassam.
- Hi, H.

743
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,078
- Nasr said you were dead.
- What? I... I never said that.

744
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,470
You did. He's lying.

745
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,994
Hey! Get...

746
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,797
- That's...
- And why would I be dead?

747
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,152
Bassam misunderstood.

748
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,039
We heard that you and Riza had split up.

749
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,554
Oh, Riza. Who's that?

750
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,395
- It's not important.
- Human or...?

751
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,960
- Doesn't matter.
- I'm just curious

752
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,918
how it works between species, so...

753
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,151
Very unimportant.
Old friend of mine, so...

754
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,960
Who runs the biggest criminal
syndicate in the galaxy.

755
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,555
Who is a very successful
businesswoman.

756
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,199
- I love a businesswoman.
- Okay.

757
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,670
- Why are we talking about this?
- So sad, H.

758
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,400
- You made a lovely couple.
- Thank you. These things happen.

759
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,518
You said,
"That psycho's gonna slit his throat."

760
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,072
Excuse us for one moment.

761
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,197
Your words, not mine. Don't you...

762
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,079
You dated this person?
It seems like a conflict of interest.

763
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,256
Conflict of interest for you
to know about my private life.

764
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,794
Yeah, sure. I would prefer not to.

765
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,031
Hey, hey, that's enough. Listen.

766
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,918
- Stop beating the hell out of him.
- Yeah.

767
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,435
- Keep this thing covered up.
- Absolutely. Will do.

768
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,113
- Thank you.
- Won't happen again.

769
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,276
Nice to meet you both.

770
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,635
- Yes.
- Yeah.

771
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,360
What?

772
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,754
Pulled this from the surveillance camera
outside the club.

773
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,718
Standing there,
making me feel uncomfortable.

774
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,120
Sorry about that.

775
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,079
- Have you shown this to T?
- You said everything goes through you.

776
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,277
Yes, everything does go
through me. Good.

777
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,195
I'll show him. Go on.

778
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,749
Goodness me.

779
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,510
Oh, boy.

780
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,314
Here comes trouble.

781
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,675
I like trouble.

782
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,194
You thinking what I'm thinking?

783
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,155
Call Riza.

784
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,916
Here. This is it.

785
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,156
Looks like a couple days' worth.

786
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,959
No one's been out to collect.

787
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,760
Hello?

788
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,514
One more step and I'll liquefy
your bangs, pretty boy.

789
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,831
- Easy, easy. We don't want any trouble.
- Okay.

790
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,559
Do not move.

791
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,076
Hey, look at you.
What do we call you, sport?

792
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,312
- "Sport" is not what you call me.
- What is it?

793
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,756
- "It"? He.
- Sorry.

794
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,349
Why would you call me anything?
Pawns don't have names.

795
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,193
We're pawns.

796
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,351
Okay. "Pawny," then.

797
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,916
- What happened here?
- Oh, we had the best party.

798
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,515
Kanye showed up
and dropped a whole new album.

799
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,832
It was some of his best work.
Look around! We got our asses kicked!

800
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,035
My queen!

801
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,789
- Oh, she's gone.
- I'll never serve another.

802
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,315
I swear it. I'll plunge my dagger

803
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,552
into my own body, like this,
through my vital organs,

804
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,395
and then leave it until the dark takes me.

805
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,235
Hey, you're not gonna actually go
through with this, are you?

806
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,155
Listen. A queen's pawn
without a queen is just a pawn.

807
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,594
A nothing.

808
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,592
I must end my own life

809
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,350
in the most painful way possible.

810
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,400
Don't stop me.

811
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,712
Chance of survival: zero.

812
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,678
- Think we should stop him?
- Gonna do it.

813
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,672
Kind of wanna see
if he goes through with it.

814
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,433
Sorry, what did you say?

815
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,557
- Nothing at all.
- Know what? I did say something.

816
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,791
- You did?
- Yeah. He's a witness.

817
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,030
Excuse me.

818
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,479
You know, I don't think
that she would want you to,

819
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,553
you know, go through with it, honestly.

820
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,951
Who are you to know
what a queen would or wouldn't want?

821
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,633
Are you a queen?

822
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,280
Well, to the extent
that all women are, yes,

823
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,636
but, no, no, I'm not a queen.

824
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,554
You know what she is, though,
is an agent.

825
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,393
"Agent"?

826
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,870
- Is that a title?
- It is a title.

827
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,792
A title of great eminence and stature.

828
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,633
M here is an agent.

829
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,712
An agent without a pawn,
if you see my meaning.

830
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,836
I never thought of this,

831
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,230
but maybe the best way
to honor the dead

832
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,074
- is to go on living.
- Yes.

833
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,073
- I pledge loyalty eternal to you, Agent M.
- No, no, no.

834
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,833
I'm not interested in a subject.

835
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,560
Too late. It's done.
I already pledged the loyalty.

836
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,552
I wish you'd said "no, no, no" before.

837
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,116
- Congratulations.
- And if you should die

838
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,079
before I, I promise to end my own life...

839
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,311
"In the most painful way possible."

840
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,951
Yeah. I don't like you.

841
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,759
Let's go.

842
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,880
My lady?

843
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,315
Come on. We'll have a fun time.

844
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,675
- Fine.
- Yes!

845
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,396
H, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

846
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,631
- I've been wanting to tell you...
- Yeah?

847
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,599
- about it. Where is it?
- You mean this?

848
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,433
- You stole it from me?
- Stole it from you?

849
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,591
I recovered evidence
you stole from a crime scene.

850
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,149
Vungus told me to hide it
and I couldn't trust anyone, so...

851
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,237
Wait, you're telling me
you listened to Vungus,

852
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,518
you trusted Vungus
instead of your partner, a senior agent?

853
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,000
In a word, yes.

854
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,191
H, speaking of agents...

855
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,240
Come on.

856
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,514
- Why would they be here?
- There's either an award show

857
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,512
we're not aware of,
or we're in deep shit.

858
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,398
Thank you. I need you to close
every street, archway and sewer now.

859
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,312
Come in closer on that body cam there.

860
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,278
- A bit more.
- Could someone please

861
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,829
explain to me what the hell is going on?

862
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,674
Sir, slightly sensitive subject.
Thought it best to keep it quiet.

863
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,991
- A bit further in, please.
- C, a word.

864
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,879
Absolutely. No one leaves
the medina, all right?

865
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,391
This... This is nonsense.

866
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,994
Despite your personal feelings,

867
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,675
H is one of the best agents
ever to wear this suit.

868
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,991
No, he was one of the best agents
to wear this suit.

869
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,477
He hasn't been the same
since the Hive. Look. Look.

870
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,950
My sources say that Vungus stole it

871
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,919
from the Jababian War Department
Advanced Research Division

872
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,193
and brought it here.

873
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,272
And you kept this from me?
For how long?

874
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,875
- Explain yourself.
- Oh, explain myself?

875
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,954
Sir, whatever that thing is,
M and H had it in your office,

876
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,992
and you let them go, sir.
With all due respect, you let them go.

877
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,074
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

878
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,874
- And, C.
- Sir?

879
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,479
Bring them straight to me.

880
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,029
Whatever that thing is,
Vungus died to protect it.

881
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,918
He gave it to me
so it wouldn't go to them.

882
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,190
- Yes, sir.
- H, listen to me. This isn't my operation.

883
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,000
<i>Get out of there. Get safe. Then report.</i>

884
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,989
- M may be right.
- You, I want sitreps every 10 minutes.

885
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,197
There could be a mole
in the Men in Black.

886
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,313
All right. Take this. I'll draw them away.
I'll meet you at the main square in 20.

887
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Go.

888
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,034
Hey, guys, what are the odds?

889
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,517
Nasr! I need to borrow your bike.

890
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,394
- As long as it is to borrow, not steal.
- Yes. Of course. Quick.

891
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,880
- Come on.
- Bassam!

892
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,793
Okay, accelerator,

893
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,314
- brake.
- Water.

894
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,516
Very hot out there.

895
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,320
That's very thoughtful of you.
This is pretty straightforward?

896
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,950
Yes. Very straightforward, indeed.
Just like riding a bike.

897
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,040
Okay, cool.

898
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,360
Sorry.

899
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,199
Well, this is nothing
like riding a bike at all.

900
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,080
Quick, jump on!

901
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,550
Hold on tight.

902
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,032
Oh, shit!

903
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,559
Hold on, Pawny!

904
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,680
Hold on!

905
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,517
Wait for me!

906
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,829
Thanks!

907
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,637
I can't believe that actually worked.

908
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,989
- Hey, H?
- Yeah?

909
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,434
Oh, right. Glasses.

910
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,351
Hi, everyone.
If you could all look right here.

911
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,440
Just drive.

912
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,035
Move! Go!

913
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,400
Oh, boy.

914
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,315
What do you think?
The red button? I think it's hyperdrive.

915
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,800
No, I think hyperdrive is blue.

916
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,554
Sometimes you have to trust your gut.

917
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,154
My gut, not yours!

918
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,910
Somebody press something!

919
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,072
Lost the tail.
What'd I tell you, huh? Hyperdrive.

920
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,800
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.
- Trust your gut. Trust your gut.

921
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,360
Oh, God, I hate sand.

922
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:03,512
The red button was awesome!
Let's press the red button again.

923
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,960
Hey, what's it doing?

924
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,760
Moving.

925
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,159
What...? What is that thing?

926
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,833
See the core?

927
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,834
How it keeps emitting convective energy
across the interior of the photosphere?

928
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,354
Yeah, yeah. No, I see all of it.

929
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,671
I see the... The photosphere bit.

930
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,719
Okay, yeah.
Those are thermonuclear explosions.

931
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,394
Wait, what? What does that mean?
Like a bomb or something?

932
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,636
I think what we're looking at is
a super compressed star.

933
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,359
And by the color temperature,

934
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,560
I'd say it's a blue giant.

935
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,275
Let's press the button.
Let's see what this does.

936
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,831
Are you suggesting that we try
a weaponized star for fun?

937
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,832
Well, for science and fun.

938
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,555
- The two aren't mutually exclusive. Okay.
- I know.

939
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,839
Yeah, there is no better place. They don't
call it the Empty Quarter for nothing.

940
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,151
Yes. That's why I made
the suggestion. Go.

941
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,280
At just.001? What do you think?

942
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,158
Yeah. Just start off slow.

943
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,390
- Press the button.
- Okay.

944
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,439
Maybe ratchet it up a few notches,
a little higher...

945
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,272
That was the low setting?

946
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,200
Do we think anyone's gonna notice
that wasn't there before?

947
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,115
Sir, they got away.

948
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,071
I believe the appropriate phrase is...

949
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,276
you lost them.

950
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,079
Well, I put it to you, sir...

951
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:17,719
- that they had help.
- Probably.

952
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,029
But I know H.

953
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,873
Whatever he's doing, there's a reason.

954
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,872
Why do you keep protecting him?

955
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,829
What is it going to take?

956
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,000
- I am protecting this institution.
- From what? From me?

957
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,035
- Are you questioning my loyalty, sir?
- At the very least, your judgment.

958
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,917
Is there anything else, Agent C?

959
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,591
- No, sir.
- Good.

960
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,319
Then would you kindly leave?

961
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,711
Vungus knew how powerful
that thing was, right?

962
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,235
He knew it could destroy worlds,
and he gave it to you.

963
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,755
I don't understand.
Someone he onlyjust met.

964
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,280
Why would he do that?

965
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,434
I don't know.

966
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,160
Maybe he trusted me.

967
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,640
I'm not gonna doubt
your general trustworthiness,

968
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,953
but, I mean,
I sang at Vungus's mother's funeral.

969
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,394
Quite beautifully, I might add.

970
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,193
We knew everything about one another.

971
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,114
I mean, hey,
I'm pretty sure he trusted me.

972
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,479
Okay, H, if you must know...

973
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,438
he said that you'd changed.

974
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,877
I'm getting sick of hearing people
giving me this "you've changed" crap.

975
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,510
- I'm the same person I was years ago.
- You've always been this way?

976
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,280
What way?

977
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,280
Vaguely inept.

978
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,596
Arrogant. Reckless.

979
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,596
- Did I miss anything?
- Okay, yeah. Hey, look.

980
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,876
Arrogant and reckless. That's nice.

981
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,872
Maybe I am a few
of those things occasionally,

982
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,953
but guess what, myjob is saving
the planet and that's what I do.

983
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,520
I do a pretty good job at it, okay?

984
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,678
And while that's still happening,
the rules are: there are no rules.

985
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,194
Well, that's a rule.

986
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,000
Damn it. All right, nobody move!

987
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,150
Drop it, hairball!

988
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,674
- Nobody move.
- Bassam.

989
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,877
- How the hell'd you get here?
- Feeling hydrated, H?

990
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,759
Never had a bath before.

991
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,957
Lost 2 pounds in dirt alone.

992
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,156
God, we drank from that.

993
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,550
Oh, God, I thought
it tasted like a living beard.

994
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:33,756
Okay...

995
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,877
Bassam, listen, all right, mate?

996
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,671
Let's be sensible.

997
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,991
I don't think you know
what you're dealing with, so...

998
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,878
Oh, no, I definitely do.

999
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,350
Which is why she's gonna pay
so much for it.

1000
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,830
- No, wait. Wait, wait!
- No, no, no!

1001
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,435
Have a nice life, bozos!

1002
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,920
Great job, H.

1003
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,109
Pawny, can you ask her to pass me
the torque wrench, please?

1004
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,637
She has a name and a title,
and you know that.

1005
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,519
My lady, the jackass wants
a torque wrench.

1006
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:12,477
Pawny, will you tell him that the sooner
he restores power to my drive console,

1007
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,631
the sooner I can figure out
how to program it?

1008
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,030
My lady says
you're a cloth-brained ass-clown

1009
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,397
whose gullible idiocy has threatened
the very existence of the planet.

1010
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,356
You know what,
she didn't say that. All right?

1011
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,591
- You worst piece on the chess board.
- She said that.

1012
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,909
Didn't say any of it.

1013
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,834
Yeah, but I was thinking it.
Actually, every single word.

1014
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,912
You make a really good point. Thank you.

1015
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,598
If you'll tell your lady
she now has power.

1016
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,871
The jackass says, my lady,
that you have power.

1017
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,512
Can you thank him?

1018
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,910
- Really?
- But in a cold, kind of polite way.

1019
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,676
You can even put a glare on it.
Just play around with it. I trust you.

1020
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,311
My lady says thank you.

1021
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,440
I know where the weapon's going
and how to get it back.

1022
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,274
- My lady?
- I got this one. I'm listening.

1023
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,670
Bassam has only one real buyer:

1024
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,031
Riza Stavros.

1025
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,956
Riza? The Riza that you went out with?

1026
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,680
The intergalactic,
alien arms-dealer Riza?

1027
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,274
I'm gonna hop back in for a second.

1028
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,353
You dated Riza Stavros,
the Merchant of Death?

1029
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,874
The Mother of Murder?

1030
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,798
- She's pretty hot.
- Okay, I didn't know

1031
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,872
she was an arms dealer when we met.

1032
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,271
And I was distracted
by her feminine wiles

1033
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,352
and her intoxicating beauty.

1034
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,872
And besides,
we weren't interested in labels.

1035
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,394
We were interested in our hearts.

1036
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,915
If having a big, old heart is a crime,
then shoot me.

1037
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,480
- Not yet.
- You'll let me know, though, right?

1038
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,710
But really?

1039
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,720
Your "big, old heart"?

1040
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,553
- What?
- It's just...

1041
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,672
Well, it...? It's funny, is it?

1042
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,480
- "My big, old heart."
- So stupid.

1043
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,877
Who talks like that? Big, old doofus.

1044
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,797
You've never been in love, have you?

1045
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,837
I'm not making fun. I'm genuinely asking.

1046
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,594
You've never once abandoned logic
for passion?

1047
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,355
What is this?
The sequel to <i>The Notebook?</i>

1048
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,751
I never saw it, but I assume
it's a lot of this type of nonsense.

1049
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,360
No, I haven't.

1050
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,753
Passion is unstable,
and logic is constant.

1051
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,280
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1052
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,671
Physical attraction is nothing more
than chemical reactions in your brain.

1053
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,111
Can't trust them. They're not real.

1054
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,159
Isn't the whole universe
a chemical reaction?

1055
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,832
Pretty sure you can trust that.

1056
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,750
Feels pretty real.

1057
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,798
That's actually kind of deep.

1058
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,634
Well, that should do it.

1059
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,080
Power her up.

1060
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,480
Thank you.

1061
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,080
Pawny.

1062
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,591
- Not there.
- That's as far as I could jump.

1063
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,840
I could jump higher,
but it would've been more awkward.

1064
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:08,990
Okay, enough.

1065
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,316
Here we go.

1066
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,833
And look at that.

1067
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,116
Well done.

1068
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,837
I know Riza.
She may be the Merchant of Death,

1069
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,560
but she does have one weakness.

1070
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,994
Ready to be a hero, little guy?

1071
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,437
- Pretty open to anything.
- Good, because we're going to Naples.

1072
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,592
Oh, to Riza's Fortified Fortress
of For Sure Death?

1073
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,994
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1074
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,640
I'm so sorry.

1075
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,720
Can we do this another day?
I have another visitor.

1076
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,560
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

1077
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,835
Thank you.

1078
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,070
- Bye.
- Bye.

1079
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,030
Luca.

1080
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,600
- Did you miss me?
- No.

1081
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,960
H.

1082
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,833
I know why you're here.

1083
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,952
Why are you wearing pink trousers?

1084
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,837
So how have you been?

1085
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,752
It's been a while, huh?

1086
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,038
That's the tough thing about breakups,
is the friendships you lose.

1087
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,312
We had some good times, though,
didn't we?

1088
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,911
Riza and I had good times, I guess.

1089
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,356
You just lurked in the background a bit.

1090
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,471
Wonderful, isn't she?

1091
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:35,032
I just love dumb, beautiful creatures.

1092
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,632
Well, this is familiar, isn't it?

1093
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,439
So...

1094
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,115
MIB finally showed you the door, eh?

1095
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,998
Showed myself out, actually.

1096
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,672
Some horses are born to roam free.

1097
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,275
And others just get shot.
What are you doing here?

1098
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,799
I wanted to see you.
And I brought you something.

1099
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,717
I know how you like special pets,
so I brought you a peace offering.

1100
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,075
Meow, meow.

1101
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,880
Bark, woof, et cetera, et cetera.

1102
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,157
Oh, I like it.

1103
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:19,393
He is cute in an ugly sort of way, isn't he?

1104
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,400
The last of his kind.

1105
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,631
You always did know the way
to my heart, didn't you?

1106
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,559
And you always knew how
to make mine beat that little bit faster.

1107
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,155
Not a neuralyzer in the world
could make me forget that.

1108
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,640
<i>I was actually looking forward</i>

1109
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,519
<i>to seeing my guns tear you to pieces,
and then I saw</i>

1110
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,718
that perfect little face of yours, and...

1111
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,880
I had to know.

1112
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Know what?

1113
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,238
I want to know the truth.

1114
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,470
Was this ever real?

1115
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,720
This?

1116
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,560
<i>You, me? Was it?</i>

1117
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,476
This'll be good.

1118
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:58,880
Was it?

1119
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,792
I knew who you were from the start.
My job was to gain your trust...

1120
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,833
and take you down
when the opportunity came.

1121
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,879
- That's the truth.
<i>- Gotta turn my earpiece off for this.</i>

1122
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,235
God, shut up.

1123
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,674
- What?
- No, I'm sorry.

1124
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,717
It's what I say to my heart...

1125
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,957
- when it's like a voice inside my head.
- Oh, I know.

1126
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,474
I couldn't fake that.

1127
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,880
Thank you.

1128
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:27,990
It's okay.

1129
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,755
No, but thank you for...

1130
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,240
For giving me closure.

1131
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,199
We all need some...
Some closure from time to time.

1132
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,590
- Get him out of here.
- What...? Wait, no. Hey.

1133
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,478
Wait. I need some closure too.

1134
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,029
- What about my feelings?
- H, here's a tip for you.

1135
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,555
Next time you bring a peace offering,

1136
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,336
don't make it the same day
I come into possession

1137
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,875
of the most powerful weapon
ever created.

1138
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,456
This has nothing to do with that.
I didn't know you had a weapon.

1139
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,359
It's a separate thing. It's a coincidence.
Total coincidence.

1140
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,113
I didn't know she had a weapon.
Did you?

1141
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,400
Take him to the boat.

1142
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,437
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

1143
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,438
Fellas, I think that went pretty well.

1144
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,716
Looks like we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

1145
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,037
Okay.

1146
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,120
Okay, okay, okay.

1147
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,593
Sebastian, darling.

1148
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,353
How would you like
to be able to destroy

1149
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,080
entire solar systems
without leaving your home?

1150
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,833
<i>- Pawny?</i>
- Yeah, I see it.

1151
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:58,200
Oh, would you look at that.
Good to go, M.

1152
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,117
Okay, Pawny, it's all on you now.

1153
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,193
Okay, that kind of pressure
is not constructive.

1154
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,358
It's very simple, darling.
Do you want it or not?

1155
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,276
No, I only have one, Sebastian,
and I won't have that for long.

1156
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,638
- No, I'm gonna give you five seconds.
- Perfectly done.

1157
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,480
I'm going to call you back.

1158
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,520
- Crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.
- Look at your little legs.

1159
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,600
You are so fast.

1160
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,912
Why, look at you run.

1161
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,680
You're so fast!

1162
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,433
Wait, I'm coming. I'm coming.

1163
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,712
Now, you don't run away again. Oh, hello.

1164
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,679
Oh, and here I thought...

1165
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,399
H worked alone.

1166
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,909
Silly me.

1167
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,480
Poor you.

1168
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,670
It's been a steep learning curve, yeah.

1169
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,955
Oh, that?
That's a snub-nosed Karzig annihilator.

1170
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:11,313
Do you know what that does
to a human body?

1171
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:16,077
It boils you from the inside out.

1172
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,236
Cute.

1173
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,876
Do you know what a Pawny does
to sadistic alien arms-dealers?

1174
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,111
No, honey. Tell me what a Pawny is.

1175
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,556
I'm a Pawny, you psycho!

1176
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,397
Looks like the tables have turned.

1177
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,200
That was an incredible catch.

1178
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,469
That felt good.

1179
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,717
Don't worry. It's all part of the plan.

1180
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,750
H, you always have been
rather delusional.

1181
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,355
Peace offering.

1182
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:23,715
Kill them.

1183
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,317
Start with him and make it hurt.

1184
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,118
No! You don't have to do this.

1185
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:32,350
Put me down, you Tarantian thug.

1186
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,952
Wait. Did you say "Tarantian"?

1187
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,157
- Yes.
- Yes, my lady, he did.

1188
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,670
They tend to be single-minded
when it comes to killing.

1189
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,400
- Brains the size of a pistachio nut.
- Okay.

1190
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,596
You're not helping.

1191
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,634
The creature you saw was
an unlicensed Tarantian

1192
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,200
from Andromeda II.

1193
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,999
Tarantian?

1194
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:57,876
I know a Tarantian.

1195
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,675
I met one once.

1196
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:01,720
I helped him.

1197
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,310
<i>Kabla nakshulin.</i>

1198
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,240
What?

1199
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,075
<i>Kabla nakshulin?</i>

1200
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,031
- What she said.
- How do you know that?

1201
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,634
Because he said it to me.

1202
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,800
Molly?

1203
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,230
Yes.

1204
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,518
Molly? Are you shitting me? Really?

1205
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,800
Who's delusional now?

1206
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,636
It's you?

1207
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,309
You've grown.

1208
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,109
I mean, me too.

1209
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,676
- Give her the box.
- Luca, you can't do this.

1210
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,073
Haven't I been good to you?
I've let you kill anyone you wanted.

1211
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,230
Come on.

1212
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,356
No?

1213
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,120
The box.

1214
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,356
Thank you.

1215
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,439
You changed my life, by the way.

1216
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,160
Hey, quickly.

1217
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,960
<i>Kabla nakshulin</i>, what does it mean?

1218
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,960
It means,
"One day, I'll kill whoever you choose

1219
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,838
in the most gruesome way imaginable."

1220
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,039
Or maybe we just keep her here
for a moment

1221
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,919
until he and I can discuss
a plan of action.

1222
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,798
H? H, are you okay?

1223
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,400
I'm good.

1224
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,518
That was... That was a rush.

1225
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,557
Yeah, and incredibly painful.

1226
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,960
- Yeah.
- Pretty sure the plan

1227
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,680
- went wrong in every conceivable way.
- Yeah, well...

1228
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,639
So it's Molly, huh?

1229
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,154
- You're not supposed to know that.
- Too late. I know it now.

1230
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,391
Guess it's only fair that you know mine.

1231
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,994
- I don't wanna know.
- I'll tell you.

1232
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,560
- Okay.
- You ready?

1233
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,640
Horatio.

1234
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,519
- It is not.
- It's not.

1235
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,200
It's Henry.

1236
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,829
Yeah, you look like a Henry.

1237
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,310
- Good. It's all I've got.
- I'm Steve.

1238
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,313
Steve? I thought you said
pawns didn't have names.

1239
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,869
We don't. I was just feeling left out.

1240
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:13,990
Oh, Steve.

1241
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:26,760
That is not cool.

1242
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:34,358
- I don't like what the earth is doing now.
- No, no, no.

1243
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:42,514
<i>Kabla nakshulin!</i>

1244
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,795
It was worth a try.

1245
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,113
We must have the weapon, for the Hive.

1246
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,271
No. I don't know if you've heard,

1247
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,795
but we are the Men in Black.

1248
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,876
The Men and Women in Black.

1249
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,556
Nice save.

1250
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,314
If you think we'll hand this over,
you've got another thing coming.

1251
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,199
You don't know who you're dealing with.
We protect the Earth.

1252
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,839
Everyone and everything on it.

1253
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,832
So you wanna do this?
You wanna get down?

1254
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,559
Fine. Let's go.

1255
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,991
Move, and I'll obliterate
this entire island and everything on it.

1256
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,080
Including us. You don't think
we should've spoken about this?

1257
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,435
I just gave a whole speech.

1258
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,877
Yeah, I liked the speech. I just thought
this would be more effective.

1259
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,031
You heard me. Don't make me use it.

1260
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,430
We'll do anything to protect our world.

1261
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,634
So will we.

1262
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,194
Nothing in this universe is unkillable.

1263
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,590
With the proper voltage.

1264
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,399
Are you both all right?

1265
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,756
Yes, sir. Never better.

1266
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,400
- Sir, how did you find us?
- Experience.

1267
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,069
Riza again, H?

1268
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,436
When are you going to learn?

1269
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:21,477
I knew I could count on you.
That, in the end, you'd pull through.

1270
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,994
Thank you, sir.

1271
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,230
You too, M.

1272
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,159
Agent O had a feeling about you,
and she was right.

1273
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,350
The universe has a way of leading you
to where you're supposed to be...

1274
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,352
At the moment
you're supposed to be there.

1275
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,950
Let's go home.

1276
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,676
Let's keep this safe, shall we?

1277
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,993
Saunder, inform the Jababian embassy,
we have the weapon.

1278
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:09,877
Quite the first assignment
for a probationary agent, M.

1279
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,079
Marrakesh,
the Empty Quarter, Naples.

1280
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,999
Imagine what you will accomplish
when you're one of us.

1281
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,920
- Yes, sir.
- Enjoy this moment, M.

1282
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,875
They never last.

1283
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:30,791
I don't know how you do it,
but you keep doing it.

1284
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,872
Yeah? What's that, C?

1285
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,030
Saving the world

1286
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:36,635
from total destruction twice...

1287
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,756
in as many years.

1288
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,194
I mean...

1289
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,919
- what are the odds?
- What are the odds?

1290
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,549
MIB!

1291
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,480
Right.

1292
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,120
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1293
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,276
- Hey.
- Hey.

1294
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:01,430
How's it going?

1295
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,000
- You know.
- Cool party, huh?

1296
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,276
- Yeah, great party.
- Something is wrong.

1297
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,555
That's what I was thinking.

1298
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,200
I said to the Dyads we'd do anything
to save our world.

1299
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,119
They said that they would too.

1300
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:14,477
Then they told us they needed
the weapon for the Hive.

1301
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,677
What if we misunderstood
what that meant?

1302
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,991
Maybe they needed the weapon
to use against the Hive

1303
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,355
to save their world.

1304
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,556
Which could mean
they were never the Hive at all.

1305
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,193
But the DNA, the mutations.
High T showed us that sample.

1306
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,875
All right. Let's see.

1307
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,520
Agent H,
bring up the Dyad forensic report.

1308
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,400
Who has the authority
to make a case file disappear?

1309
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,480
Come with me.

1310
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:55,238
And what about Naples?
How did he know we were there?

1311
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,549
He was doing his job.

1312
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,637
Does his job include tracking us?

1313
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:01,280
He gave this to me as a gift.
It has a chip inside it.

1314
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:06,957
We need to see
the confiscated Jababian weapon.

1315
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,040
Not possible.

1316
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,037
Not possible?
I'm the senior agent on the case.

1317
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,952
Let's make it possible.
Where's the weapon?

1318
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,312
I think he's been chasing it
the entire time.

1319
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,876
- High T is the mole. He's gotta be.
- A mole for who? Where would he take it?

1320
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Paris.

1321
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:29,039
My guess would be Paris.

1322
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,874
I knew all along that something was off.

1323
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:35,431
I thought he was covering for you,
but it turns out, it was him.

1324
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,795
He was hiding his own tracks.

1325
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,599
Gotta be an explanation. M, come on.

1326
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,120
- I'm coming with you.
- No, C.

1327
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,840
Hey, hey. Come on, now.
This isn't about you.

1328
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,354
I know. I agree.

1329
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:47,035
If it turns out what you're saying is true

1330
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,750
and word gets out that T,
the most decorated agent in MIB history,

1331
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,991
is a traitor, the agency will never recover.

1332
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,557
If we stop him, no one ever has to know.

1333
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:58,280
But what if you can't stop him?
Then what?

1334
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,152
Well, then tell them it was me.

1335
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:05,836
Tell them I was the traitor.
Trust me, the agency will believe you.

1336
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:10,160
You.

1337
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,471
Oh, that's right. That happened.

1338
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,153
- That's what I'm talking about.
- I'm driving.

1339
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,758
- That really should be here.
- Not in this country.

1340
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,192
There should be
a big red button somewhere.

1341
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:03,237
Yes! Press the red button.

1342
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:04,870
Found it.

1343
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,039
<i>H, you gotta see this.</i>

1344
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,520
<i>A portal from Sector C
has been activated.</i>

1345
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,956
- The Hive.
<i>- I'm sending you backup. Out.</i>

1346
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,630
You remember when I told you
we're in the lying business?

1347
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:42,152
T said that to me when he recruited me.
He said, "We have to lie to the world,

1348
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,960
which means we can never lie
to each other."

1349
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,119
I just don't believe that he has.

1350
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,920
But you can't always trust your gut, H.

1351
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,880
- Sometimes things are as they appear.
- No, we saved the world, for God's sakes.

1352
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,032
Together, with nothing but our wits
and our Series-7 De-Atomizers.

1353
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,350
So I've heard.

1354
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:35,591
- H?
- Yeah?

1355
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:38,957
Mind telling me one more time?
How'd you beat the Hive?

1356
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,195
It was three years ago.
High T and I went to face the Hive

1357
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:47,200
with nothing but our wits
and our Series-7 De-Atomizers. Cool?

1358
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,352
- Yes, but how'd you do it?
- Wait. What are you doing?

1359
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,397
- I'm curious. How'd you do it?
- I told you.

1360
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,517
- You didn't, though.
- I did a few times.

1361
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,115
Okay, High T and I went up
to face the Hive

1362
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,272
with nothing but our wits
and our Series-7 De-Atomizers...

1363
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,955
Am I...? I'm repeating myself, aren't I?

1364
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,838
- Over and over.
- Word for word.

1365
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,719
Yeah... Okay, why would I be doing that?

1366
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,951
H, I don't think that you beat
the Hive that night.

1367
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,953
I think you were neuralyzed.

1368
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,519
You came to say goodbye.

1369
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,592
And you brought the lovely M.

1370
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,596
You can really feel the history here.

1371
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,315
Eiffel discovering wormholes,

1372
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,756
gangways to other civilizations,

1373
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,230
the First Alien Migration.

1374
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,398
And we made history here too,
didn't we, H?

1375
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,873
With just our wits
and our Series-7 De-Atomizers.

1376
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,316
No. We didn't.

1377
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,639
The Hive wanted
the most powerful weapon in the galaxy,

1378
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:14,360
so you had Vungus bring it
to Men in Black.

1379
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:16,716
You'd wait.
When it came, you'd give it to them.

1380
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,919
My dear boy,
you were always a bright one...

1381
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,957
but there's no stopping this.

1382
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,397
With the weapon out of the way,
every planet will fall,

1383
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,199
starting with this one.

1384
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,999
Step away from the controls.

1385
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,999
You neuralyzed me.

1386
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,720
Made me a hero,
the guy that saved the world.

1387
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,553
Left alive to sell the lie.

1388
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,592
They wanted this.

1389
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:45,190
You were there.

1390
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,032
- You were always like a son to me.
- H?

1391
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:53,351
You were always like a son to me.

1392
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,674
That's not High T anymore.

1393
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,275
You were always like a son to him.

1394
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:15,836
Shoot it! Shoot it!

1395
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,313
My queen!

1396
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,510
I'm coming!

1397
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,873
What do we do? What do we do?

1398
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,990
I'm gonna get it back.
I know he's still in there somewhere.

1399
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:03,680
Hey!

1400
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,719
Hey! I know you're in there somewhere!

1401
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:12,439
It's me, H.

1402
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,240
Remember, you wanted me
to take your place.

1403
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,710
M!

1404
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,472
<i>The truth of the universe.</i>

1405
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:30,072
I want to know how it all works.

1406
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,516
The universe has a way of leading you
to where you're supposed to be.

1407
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,635
<i>At the moment
you're supposed to be there.</i>

1408
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,839
My queen!

1409
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,192
I'm not losing another queen.

1410
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,760
You said I was like a son to you.

1411
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,276
You were like a father to me.

1412
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,960
H.

1413
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,590
Right time...

1414
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,750
right place.

1415
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,120
Pawny?

1416
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:08,358
- Yeah?
- You've served your queen well.

1417
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,199
Thank you, my lady.

1418
01:40:10,280 --> 01:40:11,714
It was my honor.

1419
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,316
So is she as tough as they say?

1420
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,033
In a word, yes.

1421
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:57,354
- Well, you didn't screw up.
- No, ma'am.

1422
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,909
Let's be honest, there were
a few bumps along the way,

1423
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,920
- friction at the start...
- Let's not be honest.

1424
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,957
Okay. No, we did not screw up.

1425
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:08,591
You said there may be a problem
in London, but you knew.

1426
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,320
I hadn't trusted London branch
for some time.

1427
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:13,437
I never understood the reason why.

1428
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:16,318
T lived for this organization.

1429
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,631
He was the very best
we had to offer. He will be...

1430
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,680
missed.

1431
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:32,719
Welcome to the circus, Agent M.
You are no longer probationary.

1432
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:37,990
There you go. My work here is done, I...

1433
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,878
- You are.
- I'm sorry, what?

1434
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:43,920
- Probationary head of London branch.
- I'm sorry. Probationary head?

1435
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,677
It sounds like I got promoted
and demoted at the same time.

1436
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,036
No. Try and cope.

1437
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:53,589
Several years ago, before all this,
T mentioned to me

1438
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:56,434
a young, up-and-coming field agent
who had certain

1439
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:59,957
leadership qualities, shall we say.
Was his faith in you misplaced?

1440
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:04,796
No, I just think there are far more
experienced agents than myself.

1441
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,270
Yeah, there are.
But you have the full support

1442
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,750
of our senior staff
and, by the way, Agent C.

1443
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,320
Is that right?

1444
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,600
- Do I take it you accept?
- Yes.

1445
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,433
Good. I'll talk to the bosses upstairs.

1446
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,034
You need to clear your London desk

1447
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:25,476
and report to MIB in New York
on Monday.

1448
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,320
New York.

1449
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:30,476
Thank you, Agent O.

1450
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,039
Congratulations, probie.

1451
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,713
Congratulations to you too.

1452
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:43,870
You'll want to brief your agents.

1453
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:44,960
Walk with me.

1454
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:50,713
So you wanted to know how it all works.

1455
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,359
Now you do.

1456
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:56,719
And as you will no doubt
have divined, Agent M,

1457
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:58,955
there's a price.

1458
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:39,800
Nope.

1459
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:43,078
Hey there. What are you doing?

1460
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,914
I told O I had to take care of
a couple things before I went back.

1461
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,994
- Yeah? What, like stealing my car?
- No, like driving it.

1462
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,675
- You're on the right side, at least.
- I'm a quick study.

1463
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:55,400
- Give me a lift back to London?
- Road trip.

1464
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:00,636
Up, up, up!

1465
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:03,516
Oh, God. Did not need that.

1466
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,796
Could you zap me
with that forgetting thing, please?

1467
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,553
What are you doing here, Pawny?

1468
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:10,314
Get used to seeing me, pretty boy.
I'm your new babysitter.

1469
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:11,914
- He's my new what?
- Babysitter.

1470
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:12,911
Queen's orders.

1471
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,879
She says the chance
of your sorry ass surviving without me:

1472
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:18,191
- Zero.
- Okay, I did not say that...

1473
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:20,237
- exactly.
- She said, "Slim to zero."

1474
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:23,358
I rounded it down to zero
because I feel like it's zero.

1475
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,715
Consider it a parting gift.

1476
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,553
Come on. I saved the world.

1477
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:28,871
You couldn't tell
because you were getting choked out.

1478
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:30,838
- Do I even have a choice?
- No.

1479
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:33,594
Yes! There we go. All right.
Where's that little red button?

1480
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:34,680
Oh, it's right here.

1481
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,994
- I still don't like you.
- I love that option.

1482
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,510
This is a complicated piece
of machinery, so be careful.

1483
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:49,600
Yeah, got it.

1484
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:51,474
I'm gonna trust my gut.

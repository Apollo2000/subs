602
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,966
Before this, before two months
ago, I was a businessman.

603
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,339
I give to everybody.
When they call, I give.

604
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,461
And you know what?

605
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,673
When I need something from them two
years later, three years later,

606
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,225
I call them,
they are there for me.

607
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,052
And that's a broken system.

608

MOORE: <i>He was right.
It is</i> a <i>broken system.</i>

609
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,768
<i>So he decided
to break it some more</i>

610
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:49,485
<i>by eliminating
all 16 Republican contenders.</i>

insult your way to the presidency.

Excuse me, one second.

619
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,050
<i>watching him neuter
the final Bush.</i>

620
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,428
They lied. They said there were
weapons of mass destruction.

00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,550
They were none and they
knew they were none.

Excuse me. One second.
No.

625

I didn't want to... The
simple fact is you cannot...

I like that.

surrogates who are more popular,

00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,822
So, I compare
how I live now

902
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,241
to how I lived in Iraq as far
as when it comes to water.

903
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,911
I had more water supply
in Iraq than I do now.

Michigan has 85% of the
nation's fresh surface water,

20% of the world.

909
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,295
You know, there's people
who have to

910
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:10,173
choose between their
water bill or medication.

911
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,514
Water bill or child care.
Water bill or car note.

912
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,216
Water bill or rent.

913
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:19,270
When you have the highest
water rates in the nation

that the water had lead levels

didn't bring it to anyone's attention,

01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:17,220
<i>TRUMP". Thank you very much.</i>

1790
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:19,768
<i>You folks are in here,
place is packed.</i>

1791
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:22,066
<i>There are lines
that go back six blocks.</i>

1792
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:26,817
<i>There is such love in this country
for everything we stand for,</i>

1793
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:29,361
<i>you saw that on election day.
(CROWD CHEERING)</i>

1794
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:31,658
<i>And you're gonna see it
more and more.</i>

1795
01:40:32,485 --> 01:40:34,954
<i>So we're all part of this
very historic movement,</i>

1796
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:40,536
a <i>movement the likes of which, actually,
the world has never seen before.</i>

1797
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:45,423
<i>SNYDER". Often, the move is to say,
"You're making a comparison to Hitler.</i>

1798
01:40:45,498 --> 01:40:47,671
<i>"It's not a perfect
comparison, and therefore,</i>

1799
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,343
<i>"let's throw
all of history out."</i>

1800
01:40:49,418 --> 01:40:50,715
Whereas what I would say is,

1801
01:40:50,795 --> 01:40:53,423
of course, the comparison's not perfect.
No comparison's perfect,

1802
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:54,849
history doesn't repeat,

1803
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:58,053
but history is this
huge resource of patterns.

1804
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:00,103
It's this huge resource
of structures.

1805
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:03,225
It's a way to try to get your bearings
in a moment like the present one,

1806
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:04,775
where we're not really sure
what's going on.

MOORE: <i>They were one of the greatest
liberal democracies in the world.</i>

1808
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:14,573
<i>They were the first country
to have universal healthcare</i>

1809
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:16,199
<i>for all citizens.</i>

1810
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:18,910
<i>They not only invented
the printing press,</i>

1811
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:22,828
<i>they read more books
than any other country.</i>

1812
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:25,663
<i>And it was not unusual
for each of their cities</i>

1813
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:27,840
<i>to have a dozen
daily newspapers.</i>

1814
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,883
<i>A robust free press.</i>

1815
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,633
<i>And they made the best movies.</i>

<i>The art, the culture,
the science.</i>

1817

<i>They were considered the most
intelligent people on Earth.</i>

<i>In November of 1932,</i>

1819

<i>they elected an immigrant, an
Austrian, to be their leader.</i>

1820
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:01,074
<i>He had
no political experience.</i>

1821
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:03,793
<i>He didn't talk
like a regular politician.</i>

1822
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:06,079
<i>He just told it like it is.</i>

1823
01:42:06,621 --> 01:42:07,998
<i>It was so refreshing.</i>

1824
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:10,883
<i>Women loved him.</i>

1825

<i>Children were always
excited to see him.</i>

he told stories.</i>

1831
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:29,026
<i>He was a great dancer.</i>

1832
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:32,738
<i>He talked about
putting Germany first.</i>

1833

disrespected the national anthem,</i>

<i>He built roads and
infrastructure and camps.</i>

1837

<i>He knew how to use
the new media.</i>

1838

<i>Radio, newsreels.</i>

his own TV network,</i>

were introduced to television.</i>

<i>But his Nazi Party</i>

1846

<i>which the Germans
called the Reichstag.</i>

<i>The popular vote was won by
Germany's left liberal parties.</i>

the communists.</i>

<i>The communist party was banned, and
their seats in parliament taken away.</i>

<i>The liberals were vanquished,</i>

1969
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:49,422
I had a defendant who killed
90,000 Jews and I asked him,

"Why did you do that?"

1971
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:53,007

"Hitler knew more than I did,

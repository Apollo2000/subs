I'm gonna need you

- Move!
- Go! Go!

11
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:12,165
Move! It's clear.

12
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:16,332
- Move, move, move.
- Clear!

13
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,669
- Let's go, let's go!
- Move! Move! Move! Move!

14
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:25,374
A plane just struck
the Pentagon.

15
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,918
Let's make sure
those phone lines are working.

16
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,218
Phones are go, sir.

17
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,819
The SVTC.
Let's contact the FAA,

18
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:38,087
find out how many planes are
in the air.

19
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:39,255
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

20
00:02:39,257 --> 00:02:40,991
<i>Let's get
these televisions working.</i>

21
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,825
May I get the president
on the line, please?

22
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:44,760
We got planes in the air
and nowhere for them to land.

23
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:46,362
I still have
one plane unaccounted for

24
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:47,629
flying over Pennsylvania.

25
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:48,765
I need permission
for them to land

26
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,700
at a Canadian airport.

27
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:52,735
<i>...very large
plane. It was going fast.</i>

28
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,170
Flying over
Pennsylvania on course.

29
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:56,140
And three other planes
are unaccounted for.

30
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,974
I'm seeing five planes
unaccounted for.

31
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,543
No! Scratch that.
I'm seeing four!

32
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:03,514
I have NORAD
on the line.

33
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,785
That is correct.
He is. That is correct.

34
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:09,721
Mr. Vice President,
POTUS on line one, sir.

35
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:14,659
Mr. President.

36
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:21,029
The situation
is, uh, extremely fluid.

37
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:22,968
I strongly recommend
you stay in the air.

38
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:28,104
I have, uh, sequestered
congressional leadership.

39
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:29,806
Okay, then.

40
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:30,907
Sir, Donald Rumsfeld is

41
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,641
at the Pentagon on line three.

42
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:35,211
- That?
- Mm-hmm. Yes, sir.

43
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:37,681
<i>Dick, are there
still passenger planes in the air?</i>

44
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:38,882
<i>I need rules of engagement.</i>

45
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,720
Let's get the President
back on line, sir.

46
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:45,755
You have authorization
to shoot down

47
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:48,425
any aircraft deemed a threat.

48
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:49,925
<i>Presidential authority?</i>

49
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:52,462
That is correct.
All orders are UNODIR.

50
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:54,563
"UNODIR," sir?

51
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:56,768
Unless otherwise directed.

52
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:02,772
<i>By all accounts
of what people saw</i>

53
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:06,242
<i>in that room
on that terrible day,</i>

54
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:07,914
<i>there was confusion...</i>

55
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:10,249
<i>fear...</i>

56
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:12,985
<i>uncertainty.</i>

57
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,620
<i>But Dick Cheney saw
something else</i>

58
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:18,957
<i>that no one else did.</i>

59
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:23,662
<i>He saw an opportunity.</i>

60
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:31,901
<i>As the world becomes
more and more confusing,</i>

61
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:34,004
<i>we tend to focus on the things</i>

62
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:36,708
<i>that are right there
in front of us...</i>

63
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:41,011
<i>while ignoring
the massive forces</i>

64
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:44,850
<i>that actually change
and shape our lives.</i>

65
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,718
<i>And with people working
longer and longer hours,</i>

66
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,987
<i>for less and less,</i>

67
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:53,689
<i>when we do have free time,</i>

68
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:55,858
<i>the last thing we want is</i>

69
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,461
<i>complicated analysis
of our government,</i>

70
00:04:58,463 --> 00:04:59,795
<i>lobbying,</i>

71
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:02,298
<i>international
trade agreements,</i>

72
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,466
<i>and tax bills.</i>

73
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,706
<i>So it's no surprise</i>

74
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,076
<i>that when a monotone,</i>

75
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:16,211
<i>bureaucratic vice president
came to power,</i>

76
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:17,713
<i>we hardly noticed...</i>

77
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,519
<i>...as he achieved
a position of authority</i>

78
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:23,886
<i>that very few leaders</i>

79
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:27,093
<i>in the history of America
ever have...</i>

80
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:30,927
- Vice President, for your...
- These tax cuts are...

81
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:32,761
- ...get this started?
- That's for your fucking...

82
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:34,997
I'm fucking dying!

83
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:38,100
<i>Forever changing
the course of history</i>

84
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:41,206
<i>for millions
and millions of lives.</i>

85
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:46,309
<i>And he did it like a ghost,</i>

86
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:50,413
<i>with most people
having no idea who he is</i>

87
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:52,050
<i>or where he came from.</i>

88
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:16,242
<i>How does a man
go on to become who he is?</i>

89
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:22,612
<i>Well, it starts in 1963...</i>

90
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:24,079
<i>when Dick's best girl, Lynne,</i>

91
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:27,218
<i>was getting straight A's
at Colorado College.</i>

92
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,761
<i>Lynne had helped Dick get
a scholarship at Yale...</i>

93
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:42,632
<i>where he did way more
drinking than class attending.</i>

94
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:47,306
<i>Pretty soon,
Dick got the boot.</i>

95
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:00,117
<i>Back then,
they would've called</i>

96
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,821
<i>a guy like him
a ne'er-do-well.</i>

97
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:06,855
<i>In today's parlance,</i>

98
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:09,060
<i>they would just call him
a dirtbag.</i>

99
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:13,833
Man down!

100
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,138
Ooh!

101
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:26,276
His leg looks like
an Elvis dance move.

102
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,579
Somebody give that poor son
of a bitch a shot of whiskey.

103
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:32,283
All right, back to work.

104
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,487
I said, back to work.

105
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:41,490
Take him into town,
put five dollars in his pocket.

106
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:42,959
Find another man for tomorrow.

107
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:45,627
Somebody help.

108
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:47,831
You got a problem, Cheney?

109
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,201
No, sir.

110
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:03,913
Huh?

111
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:05,551
Are we becoming friends?

112
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:08,651
Will you stop touching me?

113
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:09,920
What?

114
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,488
What are you gonna do
about it, Mr. Yale?

115
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,358
Huh? Whoo!

116
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:18,528
The fuck you gonna do
about it, Mr. Yale? Come on!

117
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,199
There you go.

122
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:53,165
Two times.

123
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,898
Two times!

124
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,734
I have to drag you
out of that jail

125
00:08:57,736 --> 00:09:01,071
like a filthy hobo.

126
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,437
I'm sorry, Lynne.

127
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,541
What?

128
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,744
- What did you just say?
- I'm sorry, Lynnie.

129
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,615
You're sorry?
Don't call me "Lynnie."

130
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,986
You're sorry.

131
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:18,754
One time is "I'm sorry."

132
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:22,493
Two times makes me think that
I've picked the wrong man.

133
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,861
You already got your ass
thrown out of Yale

134
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:28,831
for drinking and fighting.

135
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,033
And now you're just going
to be a lush

136
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:31,600
that hangs power lines
for the state?

137
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:33,001
Are you gonna live
in a trailer?

138
00:09:33,003 --> 00:09:34,270
We're gonna have ten kids?
Is that the plan?

139
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:35,471
Can we discuss
this later, please?

140
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:36,940
No, we're gonna
discuss this right now

141
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,807
while you smell like vomit

142
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,178
and cheap booze.

143
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,979
- Does Dick want some coffee?
- What?

144
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,514
Mom, get out!

145
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,682
Get out.
"Does Dick want some coffee?"

146
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:48,654
Jesus Christ!

147
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:51,556
Okay. Here's my plan.

148
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:54,226
All right?

149
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:59,961
Either you stand up straight...

150
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:02,865
and you get
your back straight...

151
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,869
and you have the courage
to become someone,

152
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,403
or I'm gone.

153
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:08,605
I know a dozen guys

154
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,576
and a few professors at school
who would date me.

155
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:12,775
I love you, Lynne.

156
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:14,078
Then prove it!

157
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:16,915
Prove it!

158
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,953
I can't...

159
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:24,320
go to a big
Ivy League school,

160
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:27,190
and I can't run a company
or be mayor.

161
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,725
That's just the way
the world is for a girl.

162
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:30,728
I need you.

163
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,303
And right now you are
a big, fat, piss-soaked zero.

164
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,075
I've, I've seen my mom
waitin' up all night

165
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,308
for my father to get home.

166
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,078
And I've seen my father
drunk in this house

167
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,147
and raising his voice
and way worse,

168
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,484
and I am not dancing
that dance anymore. I'm not.

169
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:56,188
You know why I fuck her?

170
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,263
I'm not.

171
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,765
So can you change?

172
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:11,170
Can you change, or am I
wasting my goddamn time?

173
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:20,679
<i>I won't ever
disappoint you again, Lynne.</i>

174
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,604
You were chosen
because of your hard work,

175
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:56,775
your diligence,
and dedication.

176
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:02,144
Stated simply, you are
America's best and brightest.

177
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:10,588
So let's go forward and learn
and be of service.

178
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,355
God bless you all

179
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:17,760
and God bless
this great nation.

180
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:22,197
And now, I'd like to introduce
some... a young man from Illinois

181
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,999
who has done quite well
for himself

182
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:25,335
here in the Capitol.

183
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:29,138
Representative Donald Rumsfeld.

184
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,585
Did Bob tell you that this
internship is a great honor?

185
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:43,789
Huh?

186
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,621
Did he?

187
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,758
Huh? Yeah?

188
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:51,463
Well, it's not.

189
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,030
It's what we called
in the Navy a "shit detail."

190
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,268
<i>Donald Rumsfeld,</i>

191
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,870
<i>or "Rummy,"
as they called him,</i>

192
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:04,440
<i>was the former captain of
the Princeton wrestling team</i>

193
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:07,412
<i>and an elite navy jet pilot.</i>

194
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:11,214
<i>Most congressmen
use their power like an axe.</i>

195
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,682
Best and brightest.

196
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:15,951
<i>Rumsfeld,
on the other hand, used his...</i>

197
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:16,987
Where?

198
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:20,690
<i>...like a master
of the butterfly knife.</i>

199
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,426
<i>And, like any master,
if you got in his way,</i>

200
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:25,161
<i>he would cut you.</i>

201
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:29,030
This can be
a great opportunity.

202
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:31,167
An opportunity to work

203
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:34,236
in the hallways
of decision-making

204
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:37,374
in the most powerful country
in the goddamn world.

205
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:39,576
And if that doesn't give you
a hard-on,

206
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,277
I don't know what will.

207
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,014
Sorry to the few ladies
in the room.

208
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:48,116
This program didn't used
to have girls, and now it does.

209
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:50,186
Anyway, I'm Don.

210
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:51,523
Whatever you do...

211
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:55,658
don't work for Bob over here.

212
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,494
He is the most boring
son of a bitch in D.C.

213
00:14:58,496 --> 00:14:59,798
Isn't that right, Bob?

214
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,264
All right, that's it.

215
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:04,466
Go get a congressman
a cup of coffee.

216
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:07,135
And if his wife calls,
he's always in a meeting.

217
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:09,639
All right, that's it. Scat.

218
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:15,211
Hey, I'm Alan.

219
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:16,413
You're the other guy
from the University

220
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,147
- of Wisconsin, right?
- Right.

221
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,448
Uh, so one of us
is supposed to start

222
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,350
with a Democrat
and the other a Republican.

223
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:24,586
Do you care
if I go with the Dem?

224
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:27,391
'Cause I did a lot of work
with the DNC on campus, so...

225
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,128
Um, what party is,
uh, the guy we just heard?

226
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,563
Well, there are three penises
walking down the street.

227
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,131
Yeah, you,
and who are the other two?

228
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:39,303
Rumsfeld is a Republican.

229
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,375
Perfect. 'Cause, uh...

230
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,377
that's what I am.

231
00:15:59,623 --> 00:16:02,293
Don't lurk.
Come in, damn it.

232
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:07,996
Um, Dick Cheney,
reporting for work.

233
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:09,398
You're congressional relations

234
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,433
for my Office
of Economic Opportunity,

235
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:13,402
and you will assist me
in my job

236
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:14,873
as counselor to the president.

237
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:17,908
Right.

238
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,543
Jesus Christ,
you want me

239
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:22,043
to pin your mittens
to your sleeves

240
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,078
so you don't fuckin' lose 'em?

241
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,214
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:16:24,982 --> 00:16:28,317
Oh, and Cheney, your two DUIs
came up on your transcript.

243
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:29,951
Don't worry.
I vouched for you.

244
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:31,287
Thank you, sir.

245
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:32,754
No, thanks are when
your neighbor Dottie

246
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,760
pulls your pud
for the first time.

247
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:37,760
You owe me.

248
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,397
- Yes, sir.
- Go!

249
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,967
The first thing
our department did

250
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:47,970
was to conduct
a sweeping audit

251
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:52,107
at the population distribution
across the nation.

252
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,743
You will see that

253
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:56,211
the Office of Economic
Opportunity benefits...

254
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:58,347
You're Rumsfeld's
lackey, right?

255
00:16:58,349 --> 00:16:59,815
Make sure he sees this.

256
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,717
We gotta get that
on Nixon's desk, huh?

257
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,854
<i>Roger Ailes,
founder of Fox News.</i>

258
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:07,624
<i>He first pitched the idea
as Conservative News</i>

259
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,292
<i>when he worked for Nixon
as a media consultant.</i>

260
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:12,126
Hey, Don.

261
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:14,797
Roger wants Nixon to start
a Republican news TV network.

262
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,500
Forget it. Roger knows TV,
but he doesn't know politics.

263
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:20,936
So I would do this
flaming baton trick

264
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:24,339
And Dick would wait backstage
with a bucket of water.

265
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:25,607
So I'm at the state finals,

266
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,876
and I throw up the baton,
and...

267
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:29,144
it doesn't come down.

268
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:33,749
Cheney! Oh.
Where did you find her?

269
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,585
It is doing nothing but damage

270
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,386
to our private
health care institutions.

271
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:40,588
But I still got second place.

272
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,525
White families.
Males.

273
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,527
Women. Hispanics.
Minorities...

274
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,064
You're quiet. I like that.

275
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,897
You don't go blabbing about
what cards you have.

276
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:52,736
I missed my flush draw
about a month ago,

277
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:56,405
but everybody still seems
to think I have pocket kings

278
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:57,839
except maybe fucking Haldeman.

279
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:00,477
Oh, I mostly play Hearts,
so I'm not...

280
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,144
No, no, no.

281
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:04,046
<i>For a man
like Donald Rumsfeld,</i>

282
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:08,116
<i>he only wanted three things
from his lackey.</i>

283
00:18:08,118 --> 00:18:10,521
<i>He had to keep his mouth shut.</i>

284
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:13,058
<i>Do what he was told.</i>

285
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:18,160
<i>And always, always be loyal.</i>

286
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:19,929
What it means is
Nixon likes me,

287
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:20,863
but his circle hates me.

288
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,230
No, I'm sure
that's not true.

289
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:24,032
So, what's it gonna be?

290
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:25,902
Is it a "yes" or a "no"?

291
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,603
It's a "yes."

292
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,439
You don't even know
what the question is, do you?

293
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,909
- I'm assuming it's to...
- No, no, no. It's okay.

294
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,777
That's exactly the kinda "yes"
I was looking for.

295
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:37,779
<i>Cheney had always
been a so-so student</i>

296
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:39,582
<i>and a mediocre athlete.</i>

297
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:44,252
<i>But now, finally, he had found
his life's calling.</i>

298
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:49,692
<i>He would be a dedicated
and humble servant to power.</i>

299
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:50,928
Here's your new office.

300
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:53,061
No windows,
but all you'd see

301
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:55,533
are a bunch of hippies
flipping off Nixon.

302
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,170
All right, then.

303
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:04,006
<i>Now, at this point,</i>

304
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:07,813
<i>you're probably wondering
who exactly I am.</i>

305
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,945
<i>Well, let me introduce myself.</i>

306
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,448
My name is Kurt.

307
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,517
<i>My favorite football team
is the Steelers,</i>

308
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,055
<i>and me and my son,
we love SpongeBob.</i>

309
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,788
<i>And if you're wondering
how I know</i>

310
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,460
<i>so much about Dick Cheney,</i>

311
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:27,296
<i>well, let's just say
we're kind of related.</i>

312
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:28,934
<i>We'll get to that later.</i>

313
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:33,801
<i>The Rifleman!</i>

314
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,344
- Hello?
- Lynnie,

315
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,147
guess where
I'm calling from.

316
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:48,185
I am so proud of you
right now, Dick Cheney.

317
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:52,089
<i>I knew I picked the right man.
I knew it even when I didn't.</i>

318
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,961
We did it.

319
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:59,194
Have you seen Nixon? Hmm?

320
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:01,497
Hmm? Hmm?

321
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:03,932
I did. I met him.
I shook his hand.

322
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:07,103
Oh, my gosh.
And he called you

323
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,137
- He gave me that, uh...
- <i>By name, like he actually...</i>

324
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:10,941
...that impish smile of his.

325
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,608
<i>I gotta pinch myself.</i>

326
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,979
Pardon my French.

327
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:21,049
It is the best fucking feeling
in the world.

328
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:24,453
I can only imagine.
I am so proud of you.

329
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:26,454
- I love you.
- <i>We are proud of you.</i>

330
00:20:26,456 --> 00:20:28,524
Your girls are proud of you.
Are you proud of your daddy?

331
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:30,025
Yes.

332
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:32,060
<i>Can you say you're proud
of your daddy?</i>

333
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:33,395
<i>My daddy.</i>

334
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:34,630
<i>You're proud of your daddy.</i>

335
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:36,399
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

336
00:20:54,652 --> 00:20:56,117
Dick Cheney's office.

337
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,721
So, now that I'm not just
flipping cards,

338
00:20:59,723 --> 00:21:01,323
I have a few ideas.

339
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:02,327
Stop.

340
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,296
See that door?

341
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:07,430
To Kissinger's office?

342
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,365
That's right.

343
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:11,267
I happen to know that Nixon
is in there right now.

344
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,835
Now, why would Nixon

345
00:21:12,837 --> 00:21:14,869
not be meeting Kissinger
in the Oval Office?

346
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:16,038
He's having
a conversation

347
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,472
he doesn't want to go
on the record?

348
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:18,907
Very good.

349
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:20,678
What is the conversation?

350
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:22,911
We're going to bomb Cambodia.

351
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:24,680
Well, that's impossible.

352
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:26,348
That needs approval
by Congress.

353
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,849
I'm over there every day.

354
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,852
Oh, fuck Congress.
Unless you're in it.

355
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:32,488
Then it's the greatest
deliberative body on earth.

356
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,123
But we're not, so fuck it.

357
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,025
But didn't the president
campaign on ending the...

358
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:38,129
Listen to me, listen to me.

359
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:40,962
Because of the discussion

360
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:42,999
that Nixon and Kissinger
are having right now

361
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,732
behind that door

362
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,568
five feet away from us,

363
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,305
in a couple of days,
10,000 miles away,

364
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,740
a rain of 750-pound bombs

365
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:53,642
dropped from B-52s

366
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,044
at 20,000 feet,

367
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:58,283
will hit villages and towns
all across Cambodia.

368
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:00,984
<i>Thousands will die.</i>

369
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:04,789
<i>And the world will change,
for better or worse.</i>

370
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,763
That is the kind of power
that exists

371
00:22:14,765 --> 00:22:16,900
in this squat little
ugly building.

372
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:21,372
Screw Kissinger.
He's overrated. Let's go.

373
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:28,644
<i>So, what are we...</i>

374
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:31,046
- Um, you know, I mean...
- Spit it out.

375
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,182
- What are you trying to say?
- Are we against spending?

376
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:34,184
What do we believe?

377
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:36,721
What do we believe?

378
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:49,198
"What do we believe?"

379
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,334
Oh. That's very good.

380
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:53,801
"What do we believe?"

381
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:03,381
Oh, shit!

382
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:12,820
Like that,
through there.

383
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:14,589
- You wanna try?
- Yeah.

384
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:16,392
You find out
what the fish want.

385
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,560
In this case, it's a worm.

386
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:21,564
And then, uh,
we use it to catch him.

387
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,631
Look it. Look it.

388
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:24,400
Dada. Dada, look.

389
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,768
The family gets to eat.

390
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,439
Is it a good trick
we're playing, for the worms?

391
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,476
It's not good or bad.
It's fishing.

392
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,041
I don't want this one hurt.

393
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:35,611
<i>Dick had taken a job</i>

394
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:39,181
<i>as a political consultant
for a large financial firm,</i>

395
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:41,518
<i>where he was finally making
good money.</i>

396
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:45,320
<i>He took the job
because Nixon's inner circle</i>

397
00:23:45,322 --> 00:23:48,222
<i>had had enough
of Donald Rumsfeld.</i>

398
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,825
I'm out.

399
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:51,559
They're sending me
to Brussels.

400
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,028
What?

401
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,467
Nixon is making me
permanent ambassador to NATO.

402
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,866
<i>Or as he called it...</i>

403
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:00,536
It's a fuck-off assignment.

404
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:01,770
Kissinger and Haldeman won.

405
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:03,137
<i>Why don't you come with me?</i>

406
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:07,076
I got a four
and a seven-year-old, Don.

407
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,877
Tell Don we are not moving

408
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:11,046
just because everyone
at the White House hates him.

409
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:12,314
Good boy!

410
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,650
I taught you well
these past couple of years.

411
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:16,020
I'm sorry, Don.

412
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,454
I really am.

413
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,556
<i>Don't worry.</i>

414
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,124
I'm like bedbugs.

415
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:24,459
You'll have to burn
the mattress to get rid of me.

416
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,529
<i>Dick was becoming
sharper and sharper</i>

417
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:30,365
<i>as a D.C. insider.</i>

418
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:33,102
<i>And Lynne had started
to write articles</i>

419
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,537
<i>and explore ideas
for her first novel.</i>

420
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:36,907
Dick.

421
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:39,176
Dick.

422
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:44,747
<i>Then she received news
from back home in Casper.</i>

423
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:51,554
<i>The Lord is my shepherd.</i>

424
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:52,653
<i>I shall not want.</i>

425
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:54,056
<i>Lynne's mother Edna,</i>

426
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:56,491
<i>who had avoided the water
her whole life,</i>

427
00:24:56,493 --> 00:24:59,928
<i>was found drowned
in the local Casper lake.</i>

428
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,297
<i>...paths of righteousness.</i>

429
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,031
<i>They said her
and Wayne, Lynne's dad,</i>

430
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:07,336
<i>had had a nasty argument
an hour before.</i>

431
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,807
She doesn't swim, Dick.

432
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,906
- My mother doesn't swim.
- What happened?

433
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:15,109
She never swam.
I don't... I don't know.

434
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:17,114
She just never swims,
and then...

435
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:20,915
<i>There was never
a serious investigation</i>

436

<i>into Lynne's mom's death.</i>

437
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
You wanna see me do
a handstand right here?

438
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:28,290
- No. Don't. Dad. Dad.
- I can do it right here.

439
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:29,924
They're getting so big.

440
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:31,425
You're gonna be
all right, Dad.

441
00:25:31,427 --> 00:25:33,229
- Yeah. Yeah.
- They're big girls.

442
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,296
God, Dad...

443
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:35,932
So listen,
after this we should...

444
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,532
What should we do?
Should we go get some food?

445
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:38,567
Girls...

446
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:39,768
Dick, they were saying
maybe...

447
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,338
Why don't you go
to the car?

448
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:46,176
Come on, girls, let's listen
to your father, all right?

449
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:57,419
They're gettin' so beautiful,
Dick. It's amazing.

450
00:25:57,421 --> 00:25:58,556
- Mmm.
- Just...

451
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:04,529
You catching any fish?

452
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:12,402
How are you, Dick?

453
00:26:14,938 --> 00:26:16,573
Things going good in D.C.?

454
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:22,579
Don't ever go near
my daughters or my wife again.

455
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,156
Hmm.

456
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:42,467
Big shot!

457
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,937
"Big shot in D.C." Dick.

458
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:56,114
Sir?

459
00:26:58,081 --> 00:26:59,714
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

460
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,464
So, uh,
what do you got?

461
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:17,501
Page eight.

462
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:24,406
Hassan Mustafa Nasr,

463
00:27:24,408 --> 00:27:26,643
a cleric
based in Milan, Italy.

464
00:27:27,444 --> 00:27:30,311
He's a member
of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya,

465
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:32,213
the group that killed
Anwar Sadat.

466
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,182
That's the blind sheikh,
right?

467
00:27:34,184 --> 00:27:35,884
There's some debate at Langley

468
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:38,920
on whether
they're a threat or not.

469
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:40,591
They claim to be peaceful now.

470
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:45,527
I claim to be eating healthy.

471
00:27:55,504 --> 00:27:56,573
Okay.

472
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,242
Go pick him up.

473
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:25,770
What's the next name?

474
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:28,903
Well, Mr. Vice President,

475
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:32,374
there's been some chatter
about, uh, uh...

476
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:35,109
an engineering student
from Berlin...

477
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:37,680
<i>I have never been
a quitter.</i>

478
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:41,049
<i>To leave office
before my term is completed</i>

479
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:44,155
<i>is abhorrent
to every instinct in my body.</i>

480
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:47,290
<i>But as president...</i>

481
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,495
<i>I must put the interests
of America first.</i>

482
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,298
<i>America needs
a full-time president.</i>

483
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,604
Nixon forgot about
the voice-activated recorders.

484
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:02,270
He got sloppy.

485
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:04,105
Is the president
being punished?

486
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:06,907
No, no. The president has
a lot of enemies.

487
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:09,010
Brussels, please.

488
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:11,614
You need to remember,
Lizzie...

489
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,949
<i>The fight in the months
ahead for my personal vindication...</i>

490
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:17,086
...that if you have power,
people will always try to take it from you.

491
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,455
Always.

492
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:20,588
- Yeah.
- Yes, ma'am.

493
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,624
You remember that.

494
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:23,759
Donald Rumsfeld, please.

495
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:26,595
This is a tragedy.

496
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:27,962
That is our president.

497
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:29,364
This is ridiculous.

498
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:34,204
I actually think this could be
very, very good news.

499
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:41,609
The way I see it,
any Republican not touched

500
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:44,246
by Watergate
is golden right now.

501
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:47,715
Nice. Well, Ford called me
before my plane took off,

502
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:48,784
and I think we're in.

503
00:29:49,552 --> 00:29:52,753
Oh, still driving
this chick magnet, huh?

504
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:53,989
You can always take the bus.

505
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:55,292
<i>Therefore...</i>

506
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:57,893
<i>I shall resign
the presidency,</i>

507
00:29:57,895 --> 00:29:59,530
<i>effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

508
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:03,999
<i>Vice President Ford
will be sworn in</i>

509
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,968
<i>as president
at that hour...</i>

510
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,368
So what's the plan?

511
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,742
Well, the plan is
to take over the damn place.

512
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:14,442
Who lit a fire
under your ass?

513
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:16,580
I haven't flipped cards
for a long time, Don.

514
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:27,125
They gave me the keys
to the damn palace.

515
00:30:28,858 --> 00:30:30,261
Chief of Staff.

516
00:30:31,094 --> 00:30:33,028
Holy shit.

517
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,930
You salty son of a bitch.

518
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:37,365
You did it.

519
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,835
All right,
we have work to do.

520
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:42,905
Kissinger is trying to kiss
and make up with the Soviets.

521
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:47,777
Well, let's make sure
that shit doesn't happen.

522
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:53,283
Yeah.

523
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:04,593
If I may, I believe
I may have a way

524
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:07,429
to put an oar in the water
on Russia.

525
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:09,832
What if we create...

526
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,499
Mr. President.

527
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:13,434
Hold on, Henry,
let's hear Dick out.

528
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:16,438
<i>One of Dick Cheney's
special superpowers</i>

529
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,307
<i>was the ability to make</i>

530
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,375
<i>the most wild
and extreme ideas</i>

531
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:24,279
<i>sound measured
and professional.</i>

532
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:26,615
What if,
on a unilateral basis,

533
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:30,352
we all put miniature wigs
on our penises

534
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:33,989
and we walked out
to the White House lawn

535
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:35,490
and jerked each other off?

536
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:40,194
So, like a puppet show,
but much more enjoyable.

537
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:43,163
Hmm. I do like
a good puppet show.

538
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:45,299
I say we do it.

539
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:47,336
<i>Henry
Kissinger has been relieved</i>

540
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,703
<i>as national security advisor</i>

541
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:50,939
<i>and replaced
by Brent Scowcroft.</i>

542
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:55,576
<i>They're calling
it the Halloween Massacre.</i>

543
00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:56,877
- Mr. President.
- Hold on, Henry.

544
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:58,579
<i>Donald Rumsfeld
has replaced</i>

545
00:31:58,581 --> 00:32:00,715
<i>Secretary of Defense
James Schlesinger.</i>

546
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,483
<i>And Dick Cheney
has been chosen as the...</i>

547
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,286
Youngest Chief of Staff
in history.

548
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:06,390
- It's amazing. It's a dream.
- It's real.

549
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:11,425
And Don is the youngest
Secretary of Defense ever.

550
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:13,260
Well, I'm not talking
about Don.

551
00:32:13,262 --> 00:32:14,965
I'm talking about you.

552
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,567
And I'm going to give you

553
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,838
a kiss right here
in the White House.

554
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:24,306
Excuse me,
Mr. And Mrs. Cheney,

555
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:26,241
These girls were trying
to enter the Oval Office.

556
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:28,742
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

557
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:31,579
- Girls...
- Hey. Hey, there. Hey, you!

558
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:34,215
Girls, this is not
a playground. Please do not...

559
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:36,085
Hey, you. Hey.

560
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,455
Is this where Santa lives?

561
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:41,858
It's even better.
It's even better.

562
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:45,328
This is where...

563
00:32:46,329 --> 00:32:49,664
the leader of
the greatest nation

564
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:51,400
on earth lives.

565
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,834
Are you one of his elves,
Daddy?

566
00:32:52,836 --> 00:32:54,269
In a way, yes.

567
00:32:54,271 --> 00:32:56,203
No, he is not, Mary.

568
00:32:56,205 --> 00:32:58,940
Your father is Chief of Staff.

569
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:00,810
Chief of Staff.

570
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:03,077
If you're silly with her,

571
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,346
she'll grow up to be
a silly woman.

572
00:33:04,348 --> 00:33:07,348
Right, of course.
I forgot.

573
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,286
That's just, uh...
That's just silly, Mary.

574
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:13,520
<i>And as the new
Chief of Staff,</i>

575
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:16,490
<i>and with the presidency
weakened by Watergate,</i>

576
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:18,058
<i>Dick Cheney wanted to find out</i>

577
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,496
<i>exactly how much power
did the president have.</i>

578
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:24,402
I would like to reinstate
executive authority.

579
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:26,200
How?

580
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:27,903
<i>Antonin Scalia,</i>

581
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,837
<i>a young lawyer
with the Justice Department</i>

582
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,840
<i>who would later go on
to serve on the Supreme Court</i>

583
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:34,275
<i>rocked Dick's world.</i>

584
00:33:34,277 --> 00:33:35,676
Interesting you should ask.

585
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:37,945
<i>Are you familiar
with the theory</i>

586
00:33:37,947 --> 00:33:39,446
<i>of the unitary executive?</i>

587
00:33:39,448 --> 00:33:41,115
No. Tell me about it.

588
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:42,482
Uh, it is an interpretation

589
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:44,486
that few, like myself,
happen to believe,

590
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:46,287
in Article II
of the Constitution

591
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:48,123
that vests the president

592
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,594
with absolute
executive authority.

593
00:33:51,494 --> 00:33:53,063
And I mean absolute.

594
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:07,409
- Hey, baby?
- Yep?

595
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:09,347
You wanna take Cole
to the high chair?

596
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:11,379
Come on, buddy.

597
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:12,948
I've gotta try
and explain

598
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,415
this thing to the people.

599
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,484
Oh, aren't you hungry?

600
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:18,419
<i>The unitary...</i>

601
00:34:18,421 --> 00:34:20,020
<i>executive...</i>

602

<i>theory.</i>

603
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,558
<i>Certain legal scholars

<i>if the president
does anything,</i>

605
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,229
<i>it must be legal,</i>

606
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,897
<i>because it's the president.</i>

607
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:31,399
<i>To hell with checks
and balances,</i>

608
00:34:31,401 --> 00:34:33,803
<i>especially
during times of war.</i>

609
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:40,109
<i>This was the power of kings,
pharaohs, dictators.</i>

610
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,508
- This is perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,745
<i>Dick Cheney
was a foot soldier</i>

612
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:46,781
<i>in the power games
of Washington, D.C.</i>

613
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:50,051
<i>But with
the unitary executive theory,</i>

614
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:51,486
<i>he could become...</i>

615
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:55,158
<i>Galactus, Devourer of Planets.</i>

616
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:59,861
<i>But then
it was election night,</i>

617
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:01,562
<i>and there was one big problem.</i>

618
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:04,732
<i>The winner,
with 272 electoral votes...</i>

619
00:35:04,734 --> 00:35:06,033
<i>we had wondered
which one of us</i>

620
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:07,334
<i>was going to make

<i>James Earl Carter,</i>

<i>the next president
of the United States.</i>

623
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:15,676
<i>And just like that,

624
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:18,446
<i>Dick Cheney, the president's
Chief of Staff,</i>

625

<i>he does not have a job.</i>

626
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:21,683
<i>At one point, he was a broker.</i>

627
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:23,218
It can't be. It's got to be
some sort of a mistake.

628
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,689
- A miscalculation.
- There goes the neighborhood.

629
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:29,460
Well...

630
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,761

00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,107
<i>on the roof
of the White House today</i>

638
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:49,444
<i>to show off the new
solar water heaters</i>

639
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:50,812
<i>installed there.</i>

640
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:52,580
<i>Today,
in directly harnessing</i>

641
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:54,116
<i>the power of the sun,
we are taking</i>

642
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,183
<i>the energy that God gave us,</i>

643
00:35:56,185 --> 00:36:00,053
<i>the most renewable energy
that we will ever see,</i>

644
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:02,589
<i>and using it to replace
our dwindling supplies</i>

645
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:04,160
<i>of fossil fuels.</i>

646
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:07,062
<i>There is no longer
any question</i>

647
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,363
<i>that solar energy</i>

648
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:12,869
<i>is both feasible
and also cost-effective.</i>

649
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,089
<i>...went on to be
Secretary of Defense.</i>

650
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:37,959
<i>Al Haig, who became Supreme
Allied Commander in Europe,</i>

651
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:41,328
<i>and, uh, Bob Haldeman,
who is doing time</i>

652
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,631
<i>in a California penitentiary.</i>

653
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,033
Well, not me. Not me, sir.

654
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:48,669
I, I will become
the gentleman from Wyoming.

655
00:36:48,671 --> 00:36:51,238
Most of all, and hear this,

656
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,508
uh, taxes must go down.

657
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,343
I'll say it again,
taxes must go down.

658
00:36:55,345 --> 00:36:57,544
- Talk. Talk.
- We must ameliorate the pain of taxes

659
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:59,346
for the working man

660
00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:01,616
and bring, uh...

661
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:04,118
...perspicacity to the fore.

662
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,221
I'm as much a Wyomingite,
our, uh, demonym...

663
00:37:08,223 --> 00:37:10,058
Blah, blah, blah.

664
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,426
Thank God
for name recognition.

665
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:13,962
...as Jedediah Smith.

666
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:16,031
Well, um, enough
of the horsing around.

667
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,901
Although that is, of course,
what, uh, us cowboys do.

668
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:20,971
Um...

669
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:25,240
Uh, vote for Cheney
for Congress.

670
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:28,243
I will not let you down,
you can count on me.

671
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:29,711
And, uh, thank you.

672
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:34,182
Vote for, uh,
Cheney in Congress.

673
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:37,821
Either he drinks next time
or I do.

674
00:37:39,555 --> 00:37:41,288
Yeah...

675
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,790
I don't want anyone to panic,

676
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:48,031
but, uh, I do believe
I have to go to the hospital.

677
00:37:49,332 --> 00:37:50,568
Now.

678
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:03,578
It's an inferior wall infarct.

679
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,050
But that,
that can be fixed, right?

680
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:07,982
If it was up to me,

681
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:09,687
you'd drop
out of the election.

682
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:12,687
But you've both made
that clear

683
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:14,321
that it's not an option,

684
00:38:14,323 --> 00:38:17,825
so you must have a minimum
of two weeks bed rest.

685
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:20,261
Two weeks off,
we'll lose our lead.

686
00:38:20,263 --> 00:38:21,665
Like hell we will.

687
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,763
<i>Dick Cheney
has an illness,</i>

688
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:25,966
<i>so he can't be here today.</i>

689
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:29,839
But we got his wife,
and she's a darn pretty girl.

690
00:38:30,707 --> 00:38:32,339
Lynne Cheney!

691
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:35,743
Hello...

692
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:37,879
Hello, how are you today?

693
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:39,180
Good, good, good to hear.

694
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:43,250
Uh, it's really nice
to be back in my home state.

695
00:38:43,252 --> 00:38:46,955
See, I grew up in Wyoming,
but it seems that, uh,

696
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,091
somewhere along the line,

697
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,225
Washington, D.C.
stopped listening

698
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:52,961
to real folks like us

699
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:56,631
and started only listening
to liberal snobs

700
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,598
who want us all
to lose our jobs

701
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,334
to affirmative action.

702
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:01,371
Mm-hmm.

703
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:03,872
Okay, Lynne. Let's...

704
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:06,777
That's right.

705
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:10,712
You know,
I went to New York City.

706
00:39:10,714 --> 00:39:13,413
Women in New York City
are burning their bras.

707
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:17,451
Well, you know what women
in Wyoming do with our bras?

708
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:19,620
We wear them.

709
00:39:19,622 --> 00:39:22,790
<i>We wear them.</i>

710
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:24,058
Here in Wyoming,

711
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,926
we believe there is
a right and a wrong...

712
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:29,796
Because I'm a mom
and a wife from Wyoming

713
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:33,234
and I know how it feels
to make every penny count.

714
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:35,937
<i>And not only
do I speak for you,</i>

715
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,138
<i>but my husband, Dick Cheney...</i>

716
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,040
<i>A hard wind of change</i>

717
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:41,042
<i>had been blowing
through America.</i>

718
00:39:41,044 --> 00:39:44,982
<i>Civil rights,</i> Roe v. Wade,
<i>environmentalism,</i>

719
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:47,147
<i>but there was
a part of the country</i>

720
00:39:47,149 --> 00:39:49,385
<i>that was angry
about this change.</i>

721
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:54,258
Thanks to my amazing wife.

722
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:58,926
It's good to be
joining you all here in D.C.

723
00:39:58,928 --> 00:40:01,365
as Wyoming's sole
congressional representative.

724
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,500
<i>And then,
big money families</i>

725
00:40:05,502 --> 00:40:07,535
<i>like the Kochs and the Coors</i>

726
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:10,071
<i>that were sick of paying
income taxes</i>

727
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:12,540
<i>rolled right into
Washington, D.C.</i>

728
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:15,142
<i>and started writing fat checks</i>

729
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:16,979
<i>to fund right-wing
think tanks...</i>

730
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:20,113
<i>that would change the way</i>

731
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:22,852
<i>many Americans
looked at the world.</i>

732
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:29,457
<i>Finally, in 1980,
this unlikely revolution</i>

733
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:32,560
<i>of the super-rich
and white conservatives</i>

734
00:40:32,562 --> 00:40:33,861
<i>found its face.</i>

735
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:35,930
<i>For those without skills,</i>

736
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:38,665
<i>we'll find a way
to help them get new skills.</i>

737
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:40,801
<i>For those
without job opportunities,</i>

738
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:42,403
<i>we'll stimulate
new opportunities,</i>

739
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:45,774
<i>particularly in the inner
cities where they live.</i>

740
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,109
<i>For those
who've abandoned hope,</i>

741
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:50,076
<i>we'll restore hope
and we'll welcome them</i>

742
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:51,879
<i>into a great national crusade</i>

743
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:54,149
<i>to make America great again.</i>

744
00:41:00,555 --> 00:41:01,992
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

745
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:05,361
<i>God bless America.</i>

746
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:10,897
<i>It was
the fucking 1980s,</i>

747
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:13,970
<i>and it was a hell of a time
to be Dick Cheney.</i>

748
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:19,073
Vote on H.R.4445,

749
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:21,542
the Undetectable Firearms Act,

750
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:25,312
to ban plastic guns that can
evade metal detectors.

751
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:26,781
Nay.

752
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:29,750
Well, thank you,
Congressmen Cheney.

753
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:31,620
I hear you've been
quite the ally.

754
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,421
<i>...establishing
Martin Luther King Jr. Day</i>

755
00:41:34,423 --> 00:41:36,025
<i>as a federal holiday.</i>

756
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:42,196
H.R.36441,
the Endangered Species Act.

757
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:45,332
Mr. T is here,
right with the First Family.

758
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:48,736
Vote on H.R.500,
the Water Quality Act.

759
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:49,970
- Out!
- Woo!

760
00:41:49,972 --> 00:41:52,376
Vote on H.R.44...

761
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,479
Someone call an ambulance!

762
00:41:57,881 --> 00:42:01,952
- Can you breathe?
- I'm having a heart attack, you idiot.

763
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:36,183
<i>Thank you, Alex,
for your very responsible...</i>

764
00:42:36,185 --> 00:42:37,417
<i>Oh, congratulations.</i>

765
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:40,354
Thank you.
I was very, very excited...

766
00:42:40,356 --> 00:42:42,723
- We are not wolves.
- Thank you.

767
00:42:42,725 --> 00:42:44,258
No, thank you.

768
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,964
Oh, they're both brilliant
but broke.

769
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,198
- Hey, George.
- Hey, Dick.

770
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,267
Hello, Lynne.

771
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:55,837
Congratulations
on your appointment.

772
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,971
Oh, well, thank you,
Mr. Vice President.

773
00:42:57,973 --> 00:42:59,540
How is your lovely family?

774
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,245
Well, we think our son Jeb
seems cut out for office.

775
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,948
We may be asking for your
endorsements in a few years.

776
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,350
Well, if he's half as charming
as you are, George,

777
00:43:09,352 --> 00:43:10,917
then you'll have
both of our votes.

778
00:43:10,919 --> 00:43:12,053
Ah, can I get that in writing?

779
00:43:12,055 --> 00:43:13,321
Oh, yeah, of course.

780
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:15,022
Dick, I just want
to say thank you

781
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:16,558
for getting the House
not to override

782
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,825
the president's veto
on the fairness doctrine.

783
00:43:18,827 --> 00:43:20,461
No, not a problem.

784
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:22,830
Happy to get rid of any
big government regulations.

785
00:43:22,832 --> 00:43:24,499
Thank you. Great.

786
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,401
<i>The fairness doctrine
was a law from the 40s</i>

787
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,604
<i>that required
any broadcast TV or radio news</i>

788
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:32,540
<i>to present both sides
of an issue equally.</i>

789
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:35,575
<i>Its repeal would lead
to the rise of opinion news.</i>

790
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:40,215
Let me tell you something,
you skinny human prophylactic.

791
00:43:40,984 --> 00:43:43,551
Love is the only human emotion
you can't fake.

792
00:43:43,553 --> 00:43:45,819
Except women.
And thank God they can.

793
00:43:48,223 --> 00:43:50,124
And eventually
to the realization

794
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,028
of Roger Ailes' dream.

795
00:43:52,828 --> 00:43:55,229
Fox News,
which would go on to become

796
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:58,600
the number one news station
in the United States

797
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:01,203
and swing America
even more to the right.

798
00:44:02,638 --> 00:44:04,671
Thank you. Great.

799
00:44:06,508 --> 00:44:09,243
Sorry. Sorry.
Hey, it's all right.

800
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:11,011
Lighten up, sweetheart.
It's a party.

801
00:44:11,013 --> 00:44:12,279
Let me go see if I can see

802
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:13,513
if everything's okay
over there.

803
00:44:13,515 --> 00:44:15,649
Great to see you both.
Love to the girls.

804
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:16,850
Love to Barbara.

805
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:18,618
Will do.

806
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,323
- That's his son.
- Oh, crap.

807
00:44:21,357 --> 00:44:23,457
George W.,
black sheep of the family.

808
00:44:23,459 --> 00:44:25,859
- Very boring people. Only in America...
- Let's go.

809
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:28,264
A little too much
unconditional love there.

810
00:44:30,098 --> 00:44:32,299
Can you feel it, Dick?

811
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:34,535
Half the room wants to be us.

812
00:44:34,537 --> 00:44:36,837
The other half fears us.

813
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:39,575
I know George is next
in line, but...

814
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:42,546
after that, who knows?

815
00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:46,382
I respect
the hell out of Reagan,

816
00:44:47,415 --> 00:44:50,317
but no one has shown the world
the true power

817
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,488
of the American presidency.

818
00:45:19,781 --> 00:45:21,415
Excuse me, Miss Mary!

819
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:25,188
You cannot leave the grounds
during school hours. Mary!

820
00:45:33,428 --> 00:45:35,029
Well, I don't understand.

821
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:37,798
You just left school? Why?

822
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,702
It doesn't make any sense.

823
00:45:40,903 --> 00:45:42,338
It was Susan.

824
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:45,207
Susan, your best friend?

825
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:49,746
Oh, honey, did you get
in a fight over a boy or...

826
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:57,220
She broke up with me.

827
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,392
Mom, Dad...

828
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,725
I...

829
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:07,164
I like girls.

830
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:10,067
I'm gay.

831
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:32,289
It doesn't matter, sweetheart.

832
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:35,524
We love you no matter what.

833
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:39,060
Daddy.

834
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,864
I love you so much.

835
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:45,568
This is going to make things...

836
00:46:46,702 --> 00:46:47,838
so hard for you.

837
00:46:55,611 --> 00:46:58,345
When George Bush Sr.
was elected president,

838
00:46:58,347 --> 00:47:02,183
Dick Cheney was made
Secretary of Defense,

839
00:47:02,185 --> 00:47:04,387
sixth in line
to the presidency.

840
00:47:05,254 --> 00:47:07,154
<i>And after a few years,</i>

841
00:47:07,156 --> 00:47:09,957
<i>it was Dick's turn
to run for president.</i>

842
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:13,993
<i>So they decided to do
some early polling numbers.</i>

843
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:15,631
Uh-huh. Guess that's it.

844
00:47:17,332 --> 00:47:19,769
We can move
those numbers. Just...

845
00:47:20,836 --> 00:47:22,403
go after the welfare state,

846
00:47:22,405 --> 00:47:24,638
- regulations, government waste.
- It'll be war.

847
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,872
No.

848
00:47:25,874 --> 00:47:27,408
I, uh...

849
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,412
I can't put Mary through that.

850
00:47:31,147 --> 00:47:33,583
Every primary opponent
will go after her.

851
00:47:39,388 --> 00:47:41,223
And we deny.

852
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:45,662
Shame them for going
after the family and...

853
00:48:24,033 --> 00:48:26,399
You let Grandma go.

854
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:28,636
Come on. Good boy.

855
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:29,639
All right.

856
00:48:31,173 --> 00:48:33,607
No. Oh, my goodness.

857
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:41,714
It's great, Philip.

858
00:48:41,716 --> 00:48:44,151
Uh, Coors has me
mapping out strategies

859
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:46,587
for people living
alternative lifestyles.

860
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:48,455
The Coors are
a wonderful family.

861
00:48:48,457 --> 00:48:50,426
They're good people.

862
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:34,903
Who is calling
on a Sunday morning?

863
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:37,607
I don't know.

864
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:40,941
Okay. I'm coming.

865
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:44,681
I'm comin'.

866
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:48,985
Hello.

867
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:53,957
That's right.

868
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,560
Mm-hmm.

869
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:06,402
Any way I can be
of assistance.

870
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,374
Yep, now that should work.
3:00 p.m.

871
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:14,308
Of course.

872
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,578
Oh, that, uh...

873
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,048
that goes without saying.

874
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:21,381
Thank you.

875
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:22,918
No, thank you.

876
00:50:24,352 --> 00:50:25,754
Who was that?

877
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,689
It was someone from

878
00:50:28,691 --> 00:50:31,825
George Bush's son's,
uh, campaign.

879
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:32,794
Jeb?

880
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,160
No, no, George W.

881
00:50:34,162 --> 00:50:36,296
- Uh, Jeb's Florida.
- Right, right.

882
00:50:36,298 --> 00:50:38,098
Oh, I still can't believe
they've got

883
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,167
that poor boy running
for president.

884
00:50:40,169 --> 00:50:42,172
What'd they want?

885
00:50:43,205 --> 00:50:47,510
They want to talk to me
about being his running mate.

886
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:50,079
What?

887
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:52,979
They didn't say it outright,

888
00:50:52,981 --> 00:50:54,680
but, uh...

889
00:50:54,682 --> 00:50:56,585
I've made
that call myself.

890
00:50:57,385 --> 00:50:58,887
That's what they want.

891
00:51:00,421 --> 00:51:02,825
A vice president
is a nothing job.

892
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:04,961
Mmm.

893
00:51:05,761 --> 00:51:07,694
Well, I'll just hear 'em out.

894
00:51:07,696 --> 00:51:09,395
I owe that to the father.

895
00:51:09,397 --> 00:51:11,665
The VP just sits around

896
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:13,466
and waits
for the president to die.

897
00:51:13,468 --> 00:51:14,970
You've said so yourself.

898
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:17,770
Yeah, it's a cruddy job.

899
00:51:17,772 --> 00:51:18,707
Yeah.

900
00:51:20,008 --> 00:51:21,377
It's just a meeting.

901
00:51:22,144 --> 00:51:23,879
Is it just a meeting?

902
00:51:25,981 --> 00:51:27,516
It's just a meeting.

903
00:51:32,787 --> 00:51:33,889
Good.

904
00:51:55,211 --> 00:51:56,546
Yes, Governor.

905
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,446
Of course.

906
00:52:00,448 --> 00:52:02,184
The governor will see you now,
Secretary Cheney.

907
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:09,758
Sure.

908
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,562
Hey! Hello, Dick.

909
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:15,964
Hello, George.

910
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,397
It's been a while.

911
00:52:18,399 --> 00:52:19,665
Last year.

912
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:21,903
Foreign policy sessions.

913
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:24,171
That's right.
Yeah, that's right.

914
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:25,809
Those meetings were, uh...

915
00:52:26,975 --> 00:52:28,908
very engaging.

916
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,712
I do remember
we both agreed

917
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:33,180
my dad
would've been re-elected

918
00:52:33,182 --> 00:52:34,647
had he taken out Saddam.

919
00:52:34,649 --> 00:52:37,619
Right. Yeah,
wartime presidents.

920
00:52:38,553 --> 00:52:40,087
Very popular.

921
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:41,857
That they are.
That they are.

922
00:52:42,925 --> 00:52:44,026
So...

923
00:52:46,495 --> 00:52:47,660
Congratulations

924
00:52:47,662 --> 00:52:51,265
on a... successful primary.

925
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:54,267
I've, uh, been through
a few myself,

926
00:52:54,269 --> 00:52:56,370
and they can be,
shall we say...

927
00:52:56,372 --> 00:52:57,537
Fuckin' exhausting.

928
00:52:57,539 --> 00:52:59,141
Right.

929
00:53:00,374 --> 00:53:01,540
Yeah.

930
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:03,576
It's a grind.

931
00:53:03,578 --> 00:53:04,678
It's a grind, I'll tell you.

932
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,116
<i>Buses, bologna sandwiches.</i>

933
00:53:08,283 --> 00:53:09,816
Hell, I like people,
but, I mean,

934
00:53:09,818 --> 00:53:11,887
you know,
enough's enough.

935
00:53:15,189 --> 00:53:16,191
So...

936
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,026
that call I received...

937
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:20,660
I forgot,
you're a brass tacks guy,

938
00:53:20,662 --> 00:53:21,962
aren't ya? I like that.

939
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,232
You surprised
I'm running for president?

940
00:53:26,234 --> 00:53:29,468
<i>He wants
to impress his father</i>

941
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,738
<i>more than anything.</i>

942
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,006
After my, uh,
shall we say, wild years?

943
00:53:34,008 --> 00:53:38,044
Well, George,
I sowed some oats myself

944
00:53:38,046 --> 00:53:39,479
back in the day.

945
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:43,149
And I still enjoy
a cold beer on occasion.

946
00:53:43,151 --> 00:53:44,618
- I bet you did.
- Mmm.

947
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,319
I bet you did, you rascal.

948
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:49,421
I can't anymore. It got bad.

949
00:53:49,423 --> 00:53:51,357
Yeah.

950
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:52,526
Good times.

951
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:54,163
<i>What does he
really want?</i>

952
00:53:55,296 --> 00:53:56,596
<i>What does he need?</i>

953
00:53:56,598 --> 00:53:58,301
It's tough, I'll tell ya.

954
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,468
I lost my first
congressional race,

955
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:05,073
and it was not good.

956
00:54:07,642 --> 00:54:09,142
How 'bout some brisket?

957
00:54:09,144 --> 00:54:10,280
George, um...

958
00:54:12,647 --> 00:54:15,415
Hey, Theresa! Hey, Theresa!

959
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:17,283
- Yell up, get some brisket.
- All right, we'll find some.

960
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:19,486
- Get the burnt ends.
- 'Course.

961
00:54:19,488 --> 00:54:20,857
So listen, I got a...

962
00:54:21,923 --> 00:54:24,225
"lack of experience" problem
in the polls,

963
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,560
and you are one of the most
experienced guys around.

964
00:54:26,562 --> 00:54:29,098
You wanna jump on board,
be my vice?

965
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:31,432
I'm honored.

966
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,767
Don't be honored, fuckin'
say yes, Mr. Brass Tacks.

967
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:36,738
Mmm. I have to say, uh, no.

968
00:54:37,539 --> 00:54:39,406
Dick, come on,
we're gonna have a lot of fun.

969
00:54:39,408 --> 00:54:42,743
What are you doin' right now?
You're in the private sector?

970
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:44,511
Yeah.

971
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:46,346
Come on,
I know you love politics.

972
00:54:46,348 --> 00:54:47,781
George.

973
00:54:47,783 --> 00:54:50,017
- Let's go.
- Not gonna happen.

974
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:51,988
Come on now.

975
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:55,254
Well, that's a shame.

976
00:54:55,256 --> 00:54:56,858
It is.

977
00:54:58,193 --> 00:54:59,896
Perhaps I could, uh...

978
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,131
help you find
the right running mate.

979
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:05,799
Run my VP search team?

980
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:08,171
Mmm. No team. Just me.

981
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,044
Yeah, yeah, that could work,
that could...

982
00:55:17,046 --> 00:55:19,881
I have to run it by Rove,
of course, but, uh...

983
00:55:21,517 --> 00:55:22,716
If I lose,
maybe I could become

984
00:55:22,718 --> 00:55:24,551
commissioner of baseball.

985
00:55:24,553 --> 00:55:26,185
You know?

986
00:55:26,187 --> 00:55:28,691
But the, um, idea...

987
00:55:29,658 --> 00:55:31,027
is to win.

988
00:55:33,028 --> 00:55:34,930
I'm gonna keep you
in the back of my mind.

989
00:55:42,037 --> 00:55:45,642
So, are you going to tell me
how it went today or not?

990
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:50,647
It was very interesting.

991
00:55:51,546 --> 00:55:52,814
He is, uh...

992
00:55:55,617 --> 00:55:56,819
...green.

993
00:55:58,653 --> 00:56:00,055
He's very green.

994
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:03,925
And you told him "no"?

995
00:56:04,693 --> 00:56:06,026
I, uh...

996
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:10,133
I told him I would help
with the, uh...

997
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:13,236
with the search.

998
00:56:27,548 --> 00:56:28,950
What are you thinking?

999
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:34,057
- I can tell you're thinking.
- Mm-hmm.

1000
00:56:40,629 --> 00:56:42,464
<i>What was
Dick Cheney thinking...</i>

1001
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:46,033
I'm thinking I've never seen
anything like this.

1002
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:49,102
<i>...after his first
meeting with George W.?</i>

1003
00:56:49,104 --> 00:56:52,074
We've had
a lot of successes, Dick.

1004
00:56:55,176 --> 00:56:58,879
And the vice president
is a nothing job.

1005
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:01,951
<i>How many steps ahead
was he looking?</i>

1006
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:05,319
<i>How did he feel
about the opportunity</i>

1007
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:06,889
<i>that was in front of him?</i>

1008
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:11,591
<i>There are certain moments</i>

1009
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:12,962
<i>so delicate...</i>

1010
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:17,099
<i>like a teacup and saucer...</i>

1011
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:23,937
<i>...stacked on a teacup
and saucer</i>

1012
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:27,240
<i>on a teacup and saucer...</i>

1013
00:57:27,242 --> 00:57:29,010
Can you change,
or am I wasting...

1014
00:57:31,213 --> 00:57:32,848
<i>...and on and on...</i>

1015
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:42,457
<i>that this moment could fall
in any direction...</i>

1016
00:57:43,591 --> 00:57:46,328
<i>and change everything.</i>

1017
00:57:48,863 --> 00:57:50,830
<i>Sadly, there's no real way</i>

1018
00:57:50,832 --> 00:57:52,767
<i>to know exactly
what was going on</i>

1019
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,133
<i>inside the Cheneys...</i>

1020
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:56,604
<i>...at this
history-changing moment.</i>

1021
00:57:56,606 --> 00:58:00,540
<i>We can't just snap
into a Shakespearean soliloquy</i>

1022
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:03,879
<i>that dramatizes every feeling
and motivation.</i>

1023
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,415
<i>That's just not
the way the world works.</i>

1024
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:15,756
My sweet Richard.

1025
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,892
Dance'd nimbly round
the king's hearth thou hath.

1026
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:22,629
Even whilst clamored I
for more, more!

1027
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:24,932
- Mm.
- Parched maw craned towards

1028
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:28,334
the drip, drip
of imagined waters.

1029
00:58:28,336 --> 00:58:32,471
But I say to you now,
rest, retire.

1030
00:58:32,473 --> 00:58:37,046
Thou hast honored thy vows
to wife and crown.

1031
00:58:38,013 --> 00:58:41,317
Has blindness usurped vision
in you, my wife?

1032
00:58:44,118 --> 00:58:47,088
No mere treaty is our union.

1033
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:50,890
Thou shared thy torch's flame
with mine.

1034
00:58:50,892 --> 00:58:53,227
Revealing halls
and spires...

1035
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,830
...of long faded empires.

1036
00:58:56,832 --> 00:59:00,767
And now, I may hold aloft

1037
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:03,338
mine own fiery cresset.

1038
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,577
And make flesh
our bond of power.

1039
00:59:09,877 --> 00:59:11,245
Dare I?

1040
00:59:12,013 --> 00:59:14,747
Dare I let hope's beak
place gathered bramble

1041
00:59:14,749 --> 00:59:17,118
upon my heart
for future's nest?

1042
00:59:17,885 --> 00:59:21,287
Many winters past
hath I let this hope die,

1043
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:24,991
cruel winds silencing
tiny birds' needy cries.

1044
00:59:24,993 --> 00:59:27,961
Now that it hath arrived,
I say yea.

1045
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:29,564
Yea.

1046
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,868
Mine own blood and will
are yours

1047
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,069
'til pierced be

1048
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:38,238
the last soldier's
breastplate,

1049
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,908
spilling forth
its ruby jelly treasures.

1050
00:59:51,787 --> 00:59:53,022
So?

1051
00:59:53,854 --> 00:59:57,193
So I think we, uh, proceed.

1052
00:59:58,426 --> 00:59:59,859
What about Mary?

1053
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:01,997
Mmm. It's VP.

1054
01:00:03,497 --> 01:00:05,533
Not the same scrutiny.

1055
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:10,437
No. He has allies, Dick.
Connections.

1056
01:00:10,439 --> 01:00:13,309
You're new to his world.
You don't know the landscape.

1057
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,385
Well, I had better conduct
a very thorough search.

1058
01:00:24,151 --> 01:00:28,089
Every stone,
hell, every grain of sand

1059
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:30,256
needs to be looked under
for this questionnaire.

1060
01:00:30,258 --> 01:00:33,325
Dick, we're asking
for all financials,

1061
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:35,162
all medical, all interviews,

1062
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,096
press, writings,
all legal records...

1063
01:00:37,098 --> 01:00:40,401
Sometimes people use LLCs
to hide certain monies.

1064
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,500
And?

1065
01:00:41,502 --> 01:00:42,703
Any more comprehensive

1066
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,404
and we would need
a rubber glove.

1067
01:00:44,406 --> 01:00:45,104
Sorry, Liz.

1068
01:00:45,106 --> 01:00:46,538
That wasn't offensive.

1069
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,841
Should I be offended?

1070
01:00:47,843 --> 01:00:49,176
Well, I'm offended.

1071
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:50,676
Dave didn't worry
if I'd be offended.

1072
01:00:50,678 --> 01:00:53,279
Oh, a rubber glove,
like a proctology exam.

1073
01:00:53,281 --> 01:00:55,048
That's, that's disgusting.

1074
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:58,252
Hello? Oh, hello...

1075
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,888
Dad, I'm taking
the cheese off your pizza.

1076
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:04,089
- Honey?
- Mmm?

1077
01:01:04,091 --> 01:01:05,859
Dave.

1078
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:06,892
David. Thoughts?

1079
01:01:06,894 --> 01:01:09,464
One. A big one.

1080
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:13,299
<i>David Addington,
Dick's main legal advisor</i>

1081
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:16,405
<i>and a huge believer in the
unitary executive theory.</i>

1082
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:19,671
<i>He was known for
telling people to their face</i>

1083
01:01:19,673 --> 01:01:21,508
<i>that they're stupid.</i>

1084
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:24,176
So the, uh, vice presidency is
part of the executive branch.

1085
01:01:24,178 --> 01:01:26,412
And because the VP casts

1086
01:01:26,414 --> 01:01:28,281
tie-breaking votes
in the Senate,

1087
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:31,417
<i>also part of
the legislative branch, right?</i>

1088
01:01:31,419 --> 01:01:32,118
Right.

1089
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,087
That means...

1090
01:01:34,089 --> 01:01:35,990
the VP is also

1091
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:40,259
<i>not part of the executive
or the legislative.</i>

1092
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:41,328
So,

1093
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,632
one could argue that, uh...

1094
01:01:44,932 --> 01:01:46,767
neither branch

1095
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,470
has oversight of the VP.

1096
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:53,008
Not only could one argue that,
I'm arguing it.

1097
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:55,174
That's brilliant, David.

1098
01:01:55,176 --> 01:01:57,343
I know. Right?

1099
01:01:57,345 --> 01:02:00,779
Karl Rove
wanted me to buy this ranch,

1100
01:02:00,781 --> 01:02:04,283
distance myself from my years
at Yale and Harvard,

1101
01:02:04,285 --> 01:02:06,953
make me more of a man
of the people for the election.

1102
01:02:06,955 --> 01:02:09,290
Mmm. Smart.

1103
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,095
So we gonna do this thing or what?
I mean, is this happening?

1104
01:02:15,097 --> 01:02:21,033
We, uh, have found some
very interesting candidates.

1105
01:02:21,035 --> 01:02:23,035
Um, if we could schedule

1106
01:02:23,037 --> 01:02:26,473
a three-hour window
to get through...

1107
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:29,111
I meant you.
I want you to be my VP.

1108
01:02:30,144 --> 01:02:32,178
- You're the solution to my problems.
- No.

1109
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,750
I'm CEO of a large company.

1110
01:02:35,984 --> 01:02:39,355
I have been, uh,
Secretary of Defense.

1111
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:42,355
I have been Chief of Staff.

1112
01:02:42,357 --> 01:02:47,727
Uh, the vice presidency
is mostly a symbolic job.

1113
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:49,261
Right, right.

1114
01:02:49,263 --> 01:02:51,200
I can see how
that wouldn't be, uh...

1115
01:02:52,968 --> 01:02:54,600
enticing to you.

1116
01:02:54,602 --> 01:02:55,537
However...

1117
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:03,312
the vice presidency is also
defined by the president.

1118
01:03:04,513 --> 01:03:06,712
And if we were to come
to a, uh...

1119
01:03:07,781 --> 01:03:09,551
...different understanding...

1120
01:03:10,919 --> 01:03:12,521
Uh-huh. Go on.

1121
01:03:13,955 --> 01:03:15,223
I'm listenin'.

1122
01:03:16,658 --> 01:03:21,160
I sense that, uh,
you're a kinetic leader.

1123
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:24,930
You make decisions
based on instinct.

1124
01:03:24,932 --> 01:03:26,732
I am. People always said that.

1125
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:28,267
Yeah, yeah. Very different.

1126
01:03:28,269 --> 01:03:30,803
Very different from, uh,

1127
01:03:30,805 --> 01:03:33,341
from your father
in that regard.

1128
01:03:34,176 --> 01:03:36,442
Now, maybe I can, uh,

1129
01:03:36,444 --> 01:03:39,245
handle some of
the more mundane jobs.

1130
01:03:39,247 --> 01:03:42,149
Overseeing bureaucracy,

1131
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,350
managing military,

1132
01:03:44,352 --> 01:03:47,689
uh, energy,
uh, foreign policy.

1133
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:54,727
That sounds good.

1134
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,667
Never wanna be
the kind of team owner

1135
01:04:00,669 --> 01:04:04,136
that, uh, pulls the starter
in the fourth inning.

1136
01:04:04,138 --> 01:04:06,575
- Mm-hmm.
- That's the manager's job.

1137
01:04:09,176 --> 01:04:10,546
One more thing.

1138
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,816
My daughter, Mary.

1139
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:17,452
Right. Rove told me
she likes girls.

1140
01:04:18,252 --> 01:04:21,821
Now, I know you have
to, uh, run against, uh,

1141
01:04:21,823 --> 01:04:26,227
gay marriage in the South,
Midwest, and, uh...

1142
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:29,495
But it's my daughter,

1143
01:04:29,497 --> 01:04:32,932
and that line
is drawn in concrete.

1144
01:04:32,934 --> 01:04:34,901
Don't you say another word.

1145
01:04:34,903 --> 01:04:37,236
So long as you don't mind us
pushing that messaging,

1146
01:04:37,238 --> 01:04:39,205
we're okay with you
sittin' that one out.

1147
01:04:39,207 --> 01:04:41,241
I think it's important
for all the...

1148
01:04:41,243 --> 01:04:42,975
all the Marys
in the world, you know?

1149
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,949
No problemo.
We got a deal?

1150
01:04:48,115 --> 01:04:50,718
Then I believe
this could work.

1151
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:53,819
Hot damn!

1152
01:04:53,821 --> 01:04:56,457
Yeah. Well, good. Hey...

1153
01:04:57,392 --> 01:04:59,491
- let's celebrate.
- <i>Secretary Cheney visited me and Laura</i>

1154
01:04:59,493 --> 01:05:01,694
<i>at our ranch
in Crawford, Texas...</i>

1155
01:05:01,696 --> 01:05:03,098
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1156
01:05:04,098 --> 01:05:09,502
<i>I realized the best choice
was standing by my side.</i>

1157
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:11,303
<i>Please welcome my friend</i>

1158
01:05:11,305 --> 01:05:14,207
<i>and my running mate
Dick Cheney...</i>

1159
01:05:19,414 --> 01:05:21,948
<i>...and his lovely wife Lynne.</i>

1160
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,149
<i>Dick never filled out</i>

1161
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:25,584
<i>his own
83-question questionnaire.</i>

1162
01:05:25,586 --> 01:05:28,520
<i>Full medical records
were never handed over.</i>

1163
01:05:28,522 --> 01:05:31,924
<i>No tax or corporate filings.
Nothing.</i>

1164
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:35,227
Cheney! Cheney! Cheney!

1165
01:05:35,229 --> 01:05:36,828
Cheney! Cheney!

1166
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:38,897
<i>To reach more
of his senior aides</i>

1167
01:05:38,899 --> 01:05:40,265
<i>to find out reasons.</i>

1168
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:41,600
<i>But we were told
when he came over,</i>

1169
01:05:41,602 --> 01:05:43,069
<i>he had already called
Governor Bush,</i>

1170
01:05:43,071 --> 01:05:44,736
<i>he had wished him well,
and that he would deliver</i>

1171
01:05:44,738 --> 01:05:46,006
<i>a brief concession speech
here tonight.</i>

1172
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,473
I don't know.

1173
01:05:47,475 --> 01:05:48,674
<i>I think
we're all sitting around</i>

1174
01:05:48,676 --> 01:05:50,343
<i>wondering what it is that, uh,</i>

1175
01:05:50,345 --> 01:05:52,511
- <i>he may be doing backstage.</i>
- They just keep going on and on.

1176
01:05:52,513 --> 01:05:54,917
Gore rescinded his concession.

1177
01:05:57,785 --> 01:06:00,990
They're claiming Florida
is too close to call.

1178
01:06:01,856 --> 01:06:05,658
He can't fucking rescind
his concession.

1179
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,259
He just did.

1180
01:06:07,261 --> 01:06:08,428
The Russians are loving this.

1181
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:11,096
There's gonna be
a recount, so...

1182
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:12,165
I don't know.

1183
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:13,369
What should we do?

1184
01:06:14,334 --> 01:06:17,405
We play it
like we've already won.

1185
01:06:18,439 --> 01:06:22,043
Which means we need
to staff the White House.

1186
01:06:23,211 --> 01:06:26,846
All right. Who's leading
the transition team?

1187
01:06:26,848 --> 01:06:27,915
I'll do it.

1188
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:30,316
That's not something
a vice president

1189
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:31,618
really does, is it?

1190
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,521
Uh-huh.

1191
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,955
- It is now.
- <i>Vice President Gore</i>

1192
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,990
<i>has called Governor Bush</i>

1193
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:39,625
<i>and retracted his concession,</i>

1194
01:06:39,627 --> 01:06:41,794
<i>because he is now...</i>

1195
01:06:41,796 --> 01:06:43,596
- What?
- <i>...of the mind that things could be turning</i>

1196
01:06:43,598 --> 01:06:45,163
<i>yet again in Florida.</i>

1197
01:06:45,165 --> 01:06:47,033
You can't do that!

1198
01:06:47,035 --> 01:06:48,904
I mean, that's laughable.

1199
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:52,473
Uh, Wolfowitz.

1200
01:06:53,908 --> 01:06:55,341
- State...
- Mmm.

1201
01:06:55,343 --> 01:06:56,808
...or Pentagon?

1202
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:59,312
Depends on who your
Secretary of Defense is.

1203
01:06:59,314 --> 01:07:00,479
- Rummy.
- Hundred percent.

1204
01:07:00,481 --> 01:07:02,314
- Mm-hmm.
- Rumsfeld?

1205
01:07:02,316 --> 01:07:04,551
Uh, doesn't Bush Senior
hate Rummy?

1206
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:05,951
Not such a bad thing with W.

1207
01:07:05,953 --> 01:07:08,220
He wants to be his own man.

1208
01:07:08,222 --> 01:07:10,423
Rumsfeld believes
in a robust executive.

1209
01:07:10,425 --> 01:07:12,024
That's good for us
on war powers.

1210
01:07:12,026 --> 01:07:14,593
Just keep him out of State,
he'll start World War III.

1211
01:07:14,595 --> 01:07:16,662
Look.

1212
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:21,334
Halliburton just gave us
a $26 million exit package.

1213
01:07:21,336 --> 01:07:23,904
Twice what we expected.

1214
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,074
They're no dummies.

1215
01:07:27,274 --> 01:07:29,477
Uh, sorry, gang.

1216
01:07:30,845 --> 01:07:32,078
Yep.

1217
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,950
Think, uh, perhaps
I should go to the hospital.

1218
01:07:37,618 --> 01:07:40,053
Oh, my God. Are you
kidding me? Oh, come on.

1219
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:43,455
Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!

1220
01:07:43,457 --> 01:07:45,725
All persons having business
with the Honorable,

1221
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:47,259
the Supreme Court
of the United States

1222
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:50,330
are admonished to draw near
and give their attention,

1223
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,365
for the Court is now sitting.

1224
01:07:52,367 --> 01:07:54,334
God bless
the United States and...

1225
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:59,171
<i>December 12th, 2000.
Antonin Scalia, remember him,</i>

1226
01:07:59,173 --> 01:08:02,075
<i>and the Supreme Court stopped
the state of Florida</i>

1227
01:08:02,077 --> 01:08:03,375
<i>from completing their recount.</i>

1228
01:08:03,377 --> 01:08:05,377
God save the United States

1229
01:08:05,379 --> 01:08:07,747
- and this Honorable Court.
- <i>George W. Bush and Dick Cheney</i>

1230
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:12,087
<i>were going to the White House
by a margin of 537 votes.</i>

1231
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,932
Hey. Hey, little Mary Claire.

1232
01:08:59,934 --> 01:09:02,337
Hey, little Mary.
My little Mary.

1233
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:06,941
<i>Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing? Hmm?</i>

1234
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:13,379
<i>Oh, they're both doing
really well.</i>

1235
01:09:13,381 --> 01:09:15,281
Except, I'm trying
to make this dinner.

1236
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:17,216
And it's, uh...

1237
01:09:17,218 --> 01:09:20,018
it's this macaroni and cheese

1238
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,621
that you said was easy

1239
01:09:21,623 --> 01:09:24,924
but it keeps just coming out
like a little watery.

1240
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:26,725
<i>It's the milk.
Remember?</i>

1241
01:09:26,727 --> 01:09:28,327
<i>You gotta add more milk.</i>

1242
01:09:28,329 --> 01:09:30,799
Yeah. It'll get thicker.

1243
01:09:31,999 --> 01:09:33,233
No, no, no, no.

1244
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,768
<i>I am. It's much better
when you use the milk.</i>

1245
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:36,868
<i>There's just so much,</i>

1246
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:38,670
<i>so much I want
to say right now,</i>

1247
01:09:38,672 --> 01:09:40,572
<i>and just, you keep doing
what you're doing.</i>

1248
01:09:40,574 --> 01:09:42,610
<i>You're doing so great.</i>

1249
01:09:45,178 --> 01:09:48,415
You have earned something
very special from your wife.

1250
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:49,950
Listen, listen, listen.

1251
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:54,153
I'm buying wine,
and I'm picking something up.

1252
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:55,591
<i>Chinese?</i>

1253
01:09:56,923 --> 01:09:59,595
<i>Okay,
I really love you.</i>

1254
01:10:01,162 --> 01:10:02,495
<i>I love you.</i>

1255
01:10:02,497 --> 01:10:05,033
<i>Yeah.</i>

1256
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:15,041
Good morning
to you too.

1257
01:10:15,043 --> 01:10:16,274
We've met a few times.

1258
01:10:16,276 --> 01:10:17,410
- It's nice to see you.
- Yes.

1259
01:10:17,412 --> 01:10:18,478
Of course.

1260
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,711
All right. Let's...

1261
01:10:19,713 --> 01:10:21,546
All right.
Let's get this thing underway.

1262
01:10:21,548 --> 01:10:23,582
Scooter, why don't you
let everyone know

1263
01:10:23,584 --> 01:10:25,018
the, um, lay of the land?

1264
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,585
Of course.
As you all know,

1265
01:10:26,587 --> 01:10:28,254
I am Scooter Libby,

1266
01:10:28,256 --> 01:10:30,089
Dick's Chief of Staff.

1267
01:10:30,091 --> 01:10:33,192
Uh, I'm also his
national security advisor

1268
01:10:33,194 --> 01:10:35,327
and a special advisor
to the president.

1269
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:38,898
Technically, Scooter outranks
any of Bush's people.

1270
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:43,102
Mary Matalin will serve
as counselor to the VP

1271
01:10:43,104 --> 01:10:44,269
and assistant to Bush.

1272
01:10:44,271 --> 01:10:46,139
David Addington,

1273
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:47,540
Dick's main legal counsel,

1274
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:49,642
will play center field
on all matters

1275
01:10:49,644 --> 01:10:51,944
relating to executive power.

1276
01:10:51,946 --> 01:10:55,648
The president
has Alberto Gonzales,

1277
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:57,416
Karl Rove,

1278
01:10:57,418 --> 01:11:00,719
Karen Hughes as his team.

1279
01:11:00,721 --> 01:11:03,288
Quite frankly,
Gonzales has no clue.

1280
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,726
Um... Rove is a hack.

1281
01:11:06,727 --> 01:11:09,027
Hughes should be
in double-A ball.

1282
01:11:09,029 --> 01:11:12,764
So we will have
fairly unobstructed access

1283
01:11:12,766 --> 01:11:14,302
to the Oval Office.

1284
01:11:15,302 --> 01:11:17,135
We will be automatically

1285
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:19,604
Bcc'd on all e-mails

1286
01:11:19,606 --> 01:11:21,441
that the president receives
or sends,

1287
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:24,210
as well as have access
to his schedule

1288
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:27,447
the second that it is set
or changed.

1289
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:29,048
And we will
also be receiving

1290
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:32,151
the daily intelligence briefing
before the president.

1291
01:11:32,153 --> 01:11:34,754
That gets us inside
the decision curve.

1292
01:11:34,756 --> 01:11:36,925
Which we'll actually
be reading.

1293
01:11:37,691 --> 01:11:39,459
Bush approved all of this?

1294
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,296
Mmm, we have, uh,

1295
01:11:42,329 --> 01:11:43,563
an understanding.

1296
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:44,863
What about the e-mails?

1297
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:46,599
Paper shredders
don't work for e-mails.

1298
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:48,600
The entire administration
will run off

1299
01:11:48,602 --> 01:11:50,502
the RNC's private server.

1300
01:11:50,504 --> 01:11:53,371
And we've deactivated
automatic archiving.

1301
01:11:53,373 --> 01:11:54,309
We're clean.

1302
01:11:55,443 --> 01:11:56,809
Okay.

1303
01:11:56,811 --> 01:11:58,643
So over at the Pentagon,
we got Don,

1304
01:11:58,645 --> 01:11:59,812
- Secretary of Defense.
- Mm-hmm.

1305
01:11:59,814 --> 01:12:01,546
Paul Wolfowitz,

1306
01:12:01,548 --> 01:12:03,849
who worked with Team B
in the Ford days,

1307
01:12:03,851 --> 01:12:05,852
Deputy Secretary of Defense.

1308
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:06,786
Let's check,

1309
01:12:06,788 --> 01:12:09,388
see what plans

1310
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:10,889
they had
to invade Iraq.

1311
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:12,558
It's already in the works.

1312
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,960
Got Ashcroft over at the DOJ.

1313
01:12:14,962 --> 01:12:17,863
State seems to be
the only tricky department.

1314
01:12:17,865 --> 01:12:21,100
That's Colin Powell,
his guy Lawrence Wilkerson.

1315
01:12:21,102 --> 01:12:23,402
Colin Powell, who never met
a camera he didn't like.

1316
01:12:23,404 --> 01:12:24,769
Wilkerson's a true believer.

1317
01:12:24,771 --> 01:12:26,038
We've got Bolton
over there.

1318
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,874
He's a loose cannon,
but he's loyal.

1319
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:30,475
Mmm. I wanna get Liz
in there as well.

1320
01:12:30,477 --> 01:12:31,810
Let's make sure that happens.

1321
01:12:31,812 --> 01:12:33,679
- Okay, Dad.
- Consider it done.

1322
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:37,515
And this list of,
uh, our people

1323
01:12:37,517 --> 01:12:39,852
does not include
about 800 others,

1324
01:12:39,854 --> 01:12:42,587
uh, lobbyists,
industry insiders

1325
01:12:42,589 --> 01:12:45,558
that we placed
in the regulatory jobs.

1326
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,759
What about Bush's friends?

1327
01:12:46,761 --> 01:12:48,393
<i>Ridge? Pataki? Thompson?</i>

1328
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:49,728
I haven't heard their names.

1329
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:52,298
They were not,
um, offered jobs

1330
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,966
in this administration,
uh, at this time.

1331
01:12:54,968 --> 01:12:56,969
Not offered jobs
at this time?

1332
01:12:56,971 --> 01:12:59,973
Are you even more ruthless than
you used to be there, Dick?

1333
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,977
Or are you just
not getting laid?

1334
01:13:07,515 --> 01:13:08,746
All right, moving on.

1335
01:13:08,748 --> 01:13:10,718
Um, got Paul O'Neill.

1336
01:13:14,989 --> 01:13:18,291
You haven't been here
in over twenty years.

1337
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:19,491
Times have changed.

1338
01:13:19,493 --> 01:13:21,693
The, uh, softer touch,

1339
01:13:21,695 --> 01:13:23,563
that's the norm now.

1340
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:27,066
We have the conservative
TV and radio

1341
01:13:27,068 --> 01:13:29,404
- doing the yelling for us.
- Mm-hmm.

1342
01:13:30,204 --> 01:13:31,903
Is your old friend
embarrassing you?

1343
01:13:31,905 --> 01:13:33,171
Is that it, Dick?

1344
01:13:36,409 --> 01:13:39,211
Soft touch. That's all.

1345
01:13:39,213 --> 01:13:40,845
All right,
I have to go to my office

1346
01:13:40,847 --> 01:13:41,848
at the
House of Representatives.

1347
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,182
You mean the Senate?

1348
01:13:43,184 --> 01:13:45,287
Vice president,
tiebreaker in the Senate.

1349
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:48,589
Nope, I mean the House.

1350
01:13:49,356 --> 01:13:51,624
<i>Dick Cheney had used
an old connection</i>

1351
01:13:51,626 --> 01:13:53,059
<i>with former wrestling coach</i>

1352
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:55,493
<i>and Speaker of the House
Dennis Hastert</i>

1353
01:13:55,495 --> 01:13:57,697
<i>to get an office at the
House of Representatives.</i>

1354
01:13:57,699 --> 01:14:00,099
<i>The House is where
revenue bills originate,</i>

1355
01:14:00,101 --> 01:14:02,669
<i>and he wanted to be
near the money faucet.</i>

1356
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:05,140
Hey, Dick.
Will this work for you?

1357
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:08,776
Two more offices
in the Senate.

1358
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,977
Hey, Dick,
I found this extra office.

1359
01:14:11,979 --> 01:14:13,446
I hope it works for you.

1360
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:15,046
And one in the Pentagon.

1361
01:14:15,048 --> 01:14:18,149
Welcome to your new home
away from home.

1362
01:14:18,151 --> 01:14:21,286
I got you
a little housewarming gift.

1363
01:14:21,288 --> 01:14:23,855
<i>And later, when Cheney
needed intelligence</i>

1364
01:14:23,857 --> 01:14:25,224
<i>to invade Iraq,</i>

1365
01:14:25,226 --> 01:14:27,026
<i>a conference room at the CIA.</i>

1366
01:14:27,028 --> 01:14:29,830
This room is soundproof
and secure.

1367
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:33,465
<i>Cheney was everywhere.</i>

1368
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:35,701
<i>But the most powerful place
in all of D.C.</i>

1369
01:14:35,703 --> 01:14:38,603
<i>was a nondescript
conference room</i>

1370
01:14:38,605 --> 01:14:40,038
<i>at a relatively new think tank</i>

1371
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,875
<i>called Americans
for Tax Reform.</i>

1372
01:14:42,877 --> 01:14:45,911
<i>Grover Norquist ran
the anti-tax group</i>

1373
01:14:45,913 --> 01:14:48,546
<i>with huge funding from
the Koch brothers network,</i>

1374
01:14:48,548 --> 01:14:51,118
<i>big oil, and big tobacco.</i>

1375
01:14:51,985 --> 01:14:53,419
<i>His "Wednesday meeting,"</i>

1376
01:14:53,421 --> 01:14:57,023
<i>as it was called,
had become the center</i>

1377
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,659
<i>of the Republican world.</i>

1378
01:14:59,459 --> 01:15:03,798
Let's go ahead and start
with the estate tax.

1379
01:15:04,665 --> 01:15:06,733
Now, this has been hard
to eliminate,

1380
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:09,768
because the tax only
affects those estates

1381
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:11,571
worth over two million.

1382
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:14,072
But we've made strides,

1383
01:15:14,074 --> 01:15:17,311
and marketing guru Frank Luntz
is here to help.

1384
01:15:23,383 --> 01:15:24,649
Hello, all.

1385
01:15:25,919 --> 01:15:28,787
Getting regular people
to support cutting taxes

1386
01:15:28,789 --> 01:15:29,956
on the very wealthy

1387
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,090
has always been
extremely hard.

1388
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:35,094
We've had some success
in the past,

1389
01:15:35,096 --> 01:15:38,066
but the estate tax has
always been very difficult.

1390
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:40,235
However...

1391
01:15:41,101 --> 01:15:43,204
I think we may have had
a breakthrough.

1392
01:15:44,104 --> 01:15:47,473
Now, the estate tax kicks in

1393
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:51,810
on anyone inheriting
over two million dollars.

1394
01:15:51,812 --> 01:15:53,882
How many of you have
a problem with that?

1395
01:15:54,982 --> 01:15:56,849
Okay. How many
of you would have

1396
01:15:56,851 --> 01:15:58,751
a problem
with something called

1397
01:15:58,753 --> 01:16:00,522
a death tax?

1398
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:08,126
Instead of global warming,

1399
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:10,929
which we all agree
sounds very scary...

1400
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:15,000
we call it

1401
01:16:15,002 --> 01:16:16,702
climate change.

1402
01:16:16,704 --> 01:16:17,902
<i>Folks, the government</i>

1403
01:16:17,904 --> 01:16:20,038
<i>is taking your money
after you die.</i>

1404
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,340
<i>Now,
we all know the Democrats</i>

1405
01:16:21,342 --> 01:16:22,908
<i>despise tax cuts,
especially for the rich.</i>

1406
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,577
<i>I want somebody to get rid</i>

1407
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:26,211
<i>of the death tax,
that's what I want.</i>

1408
01:16:26,213 --> 01:16:27,679
<i>I don't want to get taxed
just 'cause I die.</i>

1409
01:16:27,681 --> 01:16:29,415
I mean, give me a break!

1410
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:31,049
<i>If I give something to my
kid, I already paid the tax.</i>

1411
01:16:31,051 --> 01:16:32,283
<i>Why I gotta pay again
'cause I died?</i>

1412
01:16:32,285 --> 01:16:33,752
<i>It's like being chastised!
I hate it.</i>

1413
01:16:33,754 --> 01:16:35,587
<i>The death tax has to go.</i>

1414
01:16:35,589 --> 01:16:38,055
<i>The elite liberals
in Washington would tax us</i>

1415
01:16:38,057 --> 01:16:40,026
<i>for laughing or crying
if they could.</i>

1416
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,461
So, with one
of the biggest media

1417
01:16:42,463 --> 01:16:45,867
and political machines
ever created behind him,

1418
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:50,769
Cheney was able to squash
action on global warming,

1419
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:52,438
cut taxes for the super rich,

1420
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,774
and gut regulations
for massive corporations.

1421
01:16:55,776 --> 01:16:57,076
<i>And then there was Cheney's</i>

1422
01:16:57,078 --> 01:16:59,745
<i>National Energy Policy
Development Group.</i>

1423
01:16:59,747 --> 01:17:04,050
<i>His first major test
to expand executive power.</i>

1424
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,184
I don't understand
what the goddamn problem is.

1425
01:17:06,186 --> 01:17:07,920
I want to hear
what the energy CEOs need,

1426
01:17:07,922 --> 01:17:09,287
and I'm not allowed to?

1427
01:17:09,289 --> 01:17:11,189
- It's called FACA.
- The hell is FACA?

1428
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:13,059
It's the Federal
Advisory Committees Act.

1429
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:15,694
Congress got their panties
in a bunch that, you know,

1430
01:17:15,696 --> 01:17:18,863
elected officials would
just let CEOs roll in

1431
01:17:18,865 --> 01:17:21,002
and, you know, write the laws.

1432
01:17:22,837 --> 01:17:24,469
The act demands that, uh,

1433
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:28,875
appropriate government employees
be present.

1434
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:30,512
Hold on a second.

1435
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:33,114
What's your name?

1436
01:17:33,913 --> 01:17:35,548
Doug.

1437
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:38,149
Doug, how long have you
been working reception

1438
01:17:38,151 --> 01:17:39,654
at the Department of Energy?

1439
01:17:40,887 --> 01:17:42,754
Three months.

1440
01:17:42,756 --> 01:17:43,992
Perfect.

1441
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:49,694
So what am I supposed
to do here?

1442
01:17:49,696 --> 01:17:51,997
Just sit there
and be quiet.

1443
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,267
Got it.

1444
01:17:57,137 --> 01:17:59,540
- Gentlemen.
- Hello.

1445
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,675
Hello...

1446
01:18:04,878 --> 01:18:06,178
How's your business
at...

1447
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,948
- We're good.
- Our stock...

1448
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:12,984
And California
has been really...

1449
01:18:12,986 --> 01:18:14,622
- since deregulation.
- Great to hear.

1450
01:18:15,522 --> 01:18:18,791
Oh. He's with
the energy department.

1451
01:18:22,163 --> 01:18:24,063
<i>The details
of Cheney's meetings</i>

1452
01:18:24,065 --> 01:18:27,532
<i>with the energy CEOs
were never disclosed.</i>

1453
01:18:27,534 --> 01:18:30,102
<i>But a Freedom
of Information request</i>

1454
01:18:30,104 --> 01:18:32,103
<i>did provide some documents,</i>

1455
01:18:32,105 --> 01:18:34,372
<i>including a map
of Iraq's oil fields</i>

1456
01:18:34,374 --> 01:18:36,041
<i>with all of the oil companies</i>

1457
01:18:36,043 --> 01:18:38,643
<i>that would be interested
in acquiring them</i>

1458
01:18:38,645 --> 01:18:43,017
<i>if somehow they were ever
to become available.</i>

1459
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:48,821
<i>And then, it happened.</i>

1460
01:18:48,823 --> 01:18:51,791
<i>Would you like to lower
your monthly mortgage payments</i>

1461
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:54,160
<i>or use the equity in your home

01:18:55,962 --> 01:18:57,162
<i>Just log...</i>

1464
01:18:57,164 --> 01:18:58,430
<i>Yeah.
This just in.</i>

1465
01:18:58,432 --> 01:19:00,032
<i>You are looking at obviously</i>

1466
01:19:00,034 --> 01:19:01,634
<i>a very disturbing
live shot there.</i>

1467
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:03,202
<i>That is
the World Trade Center,</i>

1468
01:19:03,204 --> 01:19:05,837
<i>and we have unconfirmed
reports this morning</i>

1469
01:19:05,839 --> 01:19:09,276
<i>that a plane has crashed
into one of the towers.</i>

1470
01:19:10,043 --> 01:19:11,710
<i>It... it does not appear</i>

1471
01:19:11,712 --> 01:19:13,845
<i>that there's any kind
of an effort up there yet.</i>

1472
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:15,447
<i>Now, remember... Oh, my God.</i>

1473
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:17,349
- Oh, God!
- Dear God.

1474
01:19:17,351 --> 01:19:18,751
<i>That looks
like a second plane.</i>

1475
01:19:18,753 --> 01:19:20,385
Mr. Vice President,
we have information

1476
01:19:20,387 --> 01:19:22,121
that a plane's headed to
the White House this moment.

1477
01:19:22,123 --> 01:19:24,121
We have less than a minute to get
to the secure underground bunker.

1478
01:19:24,123 --> 01:19:26,093
Let's go! Move!

1479
01:19:27,328 --> 01:19:28,260
Move!

1480
01:19:28,262 --> 01:19:29,260
Move! It's clear!

1481
01:19:29,262 --> 01:19:31,163
Sir, this way. Right now.

1482
01:19:31,165 --> 01:19:32,863
<i>Capitol is being
evacuated, we're told,</i>

1483
01:19:32,865 --> 01:19:36,001
<i>and clearly that shot that
we have on our screen now,</i>

1484
01:19:36,003 --> 01:19:37,435
<i>this is the Pentagon</i>

1485
01:19:37,437 --> 01:19:40,105
<i>just across the river
from Washington, D.C.</i>

1486
01:19:40,107 --> 01:19:41,174
<i>You got to believe...</i>

1487
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:42,742
I need you
to take me to Dick.

1488
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,678
Mrs. Cheney, we cannot
go back to the White House,

1489
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,011
I am being told no one...

1490
01:19:47,013 --> 01:19:48,580
Either you take me
to the White House...

1491
01:19:57,490 --> 01:20:00,560
Author is on the move.
Coming out.

1492
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:04,496
<i>...the Twin
Towers of the World Trade Center.</i>

1493
01:20:04,498 --> 01:20:06,599
Have you gotten
the Prime Minister yet?

1494
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:08,568
<i>...headed directly
into the World Trade Center.</i>

1495
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,169
<i>It just flew into it.</i>

1496
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:12,103
Canada's Prime Minister
is on the phone.

1497
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:13,438
That's right,
we got planes in the air

1498
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,040
and nowhere for them to land.

1499
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:18,042
Permission for them
to land at Canadian airports,

1500
01:20:18,044 --> 01:20:19,511
international flights
into Newfoundland.

1501
01:20:19,513 --> 01:20:21,447
I still have one plane
unaccounted for

1502
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:22,514
flying over Pennsylvania.

1503
01:20:22,516 --> 01:20:23,616
Sir, Donald Rumsfeld

1504
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:24,884
is at the Pentagon
on line three.

1505
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:26,117
- That?
- Mm-hmm.

1506
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:27,354
Yes, sir.

1507
01:20:28,556 --> 01:20:30,755
You have authorization

1508
01:20:30,757 --> 01:20:33,258
to shoot down any aircraft

1509
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,060
deemed a threat.

1510
01:20:35,062 --> 01:20:36,795
<i>Presidential authority?</i>

1511
01:20:36,797 --> 01:20:37,862
That is correct.

1512
01:20:37,864 --> 01:20:39,697
All orders are UNODIR.

1513
01:20:39,699 --> 01:20:40,631
"UNODIR", sir?

1514
01:20:40,633 --> 01:20:42,468
Unless otherwise directed.

1515
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,402
Mr. Vice President,
are we sure these are

1516
01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:46,438
the proper rules of engagement?

1517
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,740
The country's under attack,
the ROE is fluid.

1518
01:20:48,742 --> 01:20:51,242
- David... Addington, David.
- Yes, sir.

1519
01:20:51,244 --> 01:20:52,745
<i>Now,
we don't know exactly</i>

1520
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,380
<i>what the people
in that room were thinking.</i>

1521
01:20:55,382 --> 01:20:57,483
<i>But it's safe to assume</i>

1522
01:20:57,485 --> 01:21:00,786
<i>that at least one person
wondered why</i>

1523
01:21:00,788 --> 01:21:02,920
<i>in the midst
of the most fateful day</i>

1524
01:21:02,922 --> 01:21:04,689
<i>in American history</i>

1525
01:21:04,691 --> 01:21:07,727
<i>was Dick Cheney
talking to his lawyer.</i>

1526
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:09,428
And, um, what, um...

1527
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:11,997
- Mr. Vice President?
- ...authority will he need?

1528
01:21:11,999 --> 01:21:13,366
So, start working on...

1529
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,535
Mr. Vice President?

1530
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,236
The congressional members
you sent

1531
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:18,903
to Mount Weather
Emergency Operations Center

1532
01:21:18,905 --> 01:21:21,072
- wanna leave.
- Nope.

1533
01:21:21,074 --> 01:21:22,407
Excuse me?

1534
01:21:22,409 --> 01:21:24,443
They're not going anywhere.

1535
01:21:24,445 --> 01:21:28,650
Just, uh, tell them, um,
we have all the helicopters.

1536
01:21:29,816 --> 01:21:30,918
Yes, sir.

1537
01:21:32,052 --> 01:21:33,352
I'm sorry,
that is a negative.

1538
01:21:33,354 --> 01:21:35,453
They are to remain
where they are.

1539
01:21:35,455 --> 01:21:37,689
There's no helicopters
available for evac.

1540
01:21:37,691 --> 01:21:39,491
That is correct.

1541
01:21:39,493 --> 01:21:42,263
If you would be so kind
to relay that information.

1542
01:21:44,864 --> 01:21:45,899
Are we at war?

1543
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:48,767
Yes, we are.

1544
01:21:48,769 --> 01:21:50,135
With whom?

1545
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,916
<i>Depot street.</i>

1546
01:22:03,918 --> 01:22:05,250
<i>Truck pulling in
across from Depot Street.</i>

1547
01:22:11,258 --> 01:22:14,193
<i>Unit 9-3.
0-3-15 negative.</i>

1548
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:19,697
<i>1-5-2-7, Brian.</i>

1549
01:22:19,699 --> 01:22:21,066
<i>God damn it.</i>

1550
01:22:21,068 --> 01:22:22,367
We picked up chatter

1551
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:24,536
from well-known
Al-Qaeda operatives

1552
01:22:24,538 --> 01:22:26,304
celebrating today's attack.

1553
01:22:26,306 --> 01:22:27,605
We shouldn't rule out Iraq.

1554
01:22:27,607 --> 01:22:29,608
But what's
Al-Qaeda's leader's name?

1555
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:31,844
His name is Osama bin Laden.

1556
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,511
But this is clearly Al-Qaeda.

1557
01:22:33,513 --> 01:22:35,648
I've been tracking
their movements for years.

1558
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,182
Their fingerprints
are all over this.

1559
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:39,253
Iraq has all the good targets.

1560
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,487
Iraq has nothing
to do with this, Don.

1561
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,221
Richard,
you don't know that for sure.

1562
01:22:43,223 --> 01:22:44,589
I do know that.

1563
01:22:44,591 --> 01:22:45,791
Mr. President, if I may.

1564
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:49,862
Afghanistan is
Al-Qaeda's headquarters.

1565
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,429
- That is where our focus should be.
- Yeah.

1566
01:22:51,431 --> 01:22:54,633
And the CIA would
be capable of taking out

1567
01:22:54,635 --> 01:22:56,135
the Taliban's power structure.

1568
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:58,202
Yeah.
All due respect, George,

1569
01:22:58,204 --> 01:22:59,138
Mr. President...

1570
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,105
we are the Pentagon,

1571
01:23:01,107 --> 01:23:02,840
and this is what we do.

1572
01:23:02,842 --> 01:23:04,011
Don.

1573
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:19,191
Okay. We'll, uh, we'll go
with Tenet and the CIA.

1574
01:23:19,193 --> 01:23:21,425
I'll make some calls
to our allies.

1575
01:23:21,427 --> 01:23:22,426
Thank you, sir.

1576
01:23:25,665 --> 01:23:29,768
I think, uh, given the current
situation, Mr. President,

1577
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:33,505
it is wise that we not be
in the same location

1578
01:23:33,507 --> 01:23:37,209
for COG,
Continuity of Government.

1579
01:23:37,211 --> 01:23:39,512
Of course.

1580
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:42,382
We gonna be all right
on this, aren't we?

1581
01:23:43,417 --> 01:23:46,754
Yes, sir. Yes, we are.

1582
01:23:50,257 --> 01:23:53,024
<i>Angler has taken
off to an undisclosed location.</i>

1583
01:23:53,026 --> 01:23:54,760
<i>I repeat, Angler is airborne.</i>

1584
01:23:54,762 --> 01:23:56,929
<i>Angler? That's the VP?</i>

1585
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:58,563
<i>I thought only
the president could land</i>

1586
01:23:58,565 --> 01:24:00,398
<i>and take off
from the south lawn.</i>

1587
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,834
<i>What can I tell you?</i>

1588
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:03,070
<i>Today's fucked.</i>

1589
01:24:27,461 --> 01:24:30,662
<i>This intelligence
has been edited,</i>

1590
01:24:30,664 --> 01:24:33,299
<i>redacted, and reduced.</i>

1591
01:24:33,301 --> 01:24:35,300
Mr. Vice President,
usually we vet

1592
01:24:35,302 --> 01:24:36,702
the daily intelligence
threat matrix

1593
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:38,937
to eliminate unreliable
sources, non-players...

1594
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:43,945
<i>Stop. Don't you dare give me
a damn disquisition...</i>

1595
01:24:44,945 --> 01:24:46,444
<i>on what I cannot hear.</i>

1596
01:24:46,446 --> 01:24:48,447
Mr. Vice President,

1597
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:50,051
a lot of this intelligence
is not verified.

1598
01:24:51,452 --> 01:24:52,751
<i>I'm gonna say this
for the last time.</i>

1599
01:24:52,753 --> 01:24:53,751
<i>I want to hear everything</i>

1600
01:24:53,753 --> 01:24:56,453
<i>every day, from now on.</i>

1601
01:24:56,455 --> 01:24:57,689
Yes, sir.

1602
01:24:57,691 --> 01:24:59,991
<i>Proceed.</i>

1603
01:24:59,993 --> 01:25:02,393
We're tracking
the possibility of bio-attacks

1604
01:25:02,395 --> 01:25:05,830
using Sarin gas,
cowpox, Ebola.

1605
01:25:05,832 --> 01:25:08,736
There was a post
on a dark website

1606
01:25:09,869 --> 01:25:12,504
about mass beheadings
in residential areas.

1607
01:25:12,506 --> 01:25:13,904
Movie studios, museums,

1608
01:25:13,906 --> 01:25:17,175
subways, daycare centers
may all be targets.

1609
01:25:17,177 --> 01:25:18,477
A source has told an asset

1610
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:20,511
about fire-bombs
targeting hospitals.

1611
01:25:20,513 --> 01:25:21,813
A video was captured

1612
01:25:21,815 --> 01:25:23,782
describing televised executions

1613
01:25:23,784 --> 01:25:25,818
interrupting
American network TV.

1614
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,652
Sporting
events, tourist attractions,

1615
01:25:27,654 --> 01:25:29,187
New Year's celebrations,
religious ceremonies,

1616
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:30,955
are all hard targets.

1617
01:25:30,957 --> 01:25:32,491
<i>Machine-gun
attacks at high-profile...</i>

1618
01:25:32,493 --> 01:25:33,992
Biological agents inside...

1619
01:25:33,994 --> 01:25:35,492
Coordinated fire-bombings

1620
01:25:35,494 --> 01:25:37,295
of commuter trains
across North America.

1621
01:25:37,297 --> 01:25:39,430
<i>Water filtration
plants targeted with bio-weapons</i>

1622
01:25:39,432 --> 01:25:40,532
<i>and killing a million people.</i>

1623
01:25:40,534 --> 01:25:41,933
<i>A briefcase nuke</i>

1624
01:25:41,935 --> 01:25:43,935
<i>being driven into
a major city and detonated.</i>

1625
01:25:43,937 --> 01:25:45,370
<i>Airborne
bio-weapons can be put</i>

1626
01:25:45,372 --> 01:25:46,804
<i>into the
air conditioning units</i>

1627
01:25:46,806 --> 01:25:49,006
<i>of large shopping malls
or casinos.</i>

1628
01:25:49,008 --> 01:25:50,876
<i>A beloved
celebrity has been targeted</i>

1629
01:25:50,878 --> 01:25:52,310
<i>for kidnapping
and possibly beheading.</i>

1630
01:25:52,312 --> 01:25:53,711
<i>Phosphorus bombs,</i>

1631
01:25:53,713 --> 01:25:55,982
<i>chlorine attacks, mustard gas,
cluster bombs...</i>

1632
01:26:04,992 --> 01:26:06,627
I'm scared, Dick.

1633
01:26:14,068 --> 01:26:16,236
I'll always take care
of you, Lynne.

1634
01:26:17,937 --> 01:26:18,873
You know that.

1635
01:26:22,142 --> 01:26:23,711
What are you going to do?

1636
01:27:04,351 --> 01:27:05,282
Move, move, move!

1637
01:27:12,525 --> 01:27:14,959
So, while Powell, the CIA,

1638
01:27:14,961 --> 01:27:16,827
and their
international coalition

1639
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:19,430
toppled the Taliban
and took Afghanistan

1640
01:27:19,432 --> 01:27:20,999
in a matter of weeks,

1641
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:23,867
Cheney had found something
much more powerful

1642
01:27:23,869 --> 01:27:26,806
than missiles or jet planes.

1643
01:27:27,807 --> 01:27:29,875
<i>Mr. Vice President,
this is John Yoo.</i>

1644
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:32,013
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Vice President.</i>

1645
01:27:33,879 --> 01:27:35,313
<i>So David told me
you're looking</i>

1646
01:27:35,315 --> 01:27:37,582
<i>for executive authority.</i>

1647
01:27:37,584 --> 01:27:38,983
Mm-hmm.

1648
01:27:38,985 --> 01:27:40,251
<i>John here
is definitely your guy.</i>

1649
01:27:41,654 --> 01:27:44,221
<i>The war we're now fighting</i>

1650
01:27:44,223 --> 01:27:47,994
<i>will require resources
and abilities that the, uh...</i>

1651
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:53,831
<i>the current interpretation
of the law... impedes.</i>

1652
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:55,000
The vice president believes

1653
01:27:55,002 --> 01:27:57,135
it is the duty
of the commander-in-chief

1654
01:27:57,137 --> 01:27:58,237
to protect the nation

1655
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,438
and that no other obligation,

1656
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,906
whether to Congress
or existing treaty

1657
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:02,276
<i>supersedes that dut.</i>

1658
01:28:03,543 --> 01:28:05,078
<i>How do you feel
about that statemen?</i>

1659
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:07,582
<i>I couldn't agree more.</i>

1660
01:28:09,048 --> 01:28:11,550
<i>John Yoo's
first legal opinion</i>

1661
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:13,684
<i>allowed the US government</i>

1662
01:28:13,686 --> 01:28:16,821
<i>to monitor every citizens'
phone calls,</i>

1663
01:28:16,823 --> 01:28:19,256
<i>texts, and e-mails
without a warrant.</i>

1664
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:24,028
<i>It was a giant legal leap</i>

1665
01:28:24,030 --> 01:28:26,367
<i>based on sketchy law at best.</i>

1666
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:29,800
<i>But John Yoo's masterpiece,</i>

1667
01:28:29,802 --> 01:28:32,672
<i>his</i> Moby-Dick, <i>if you will,</i>

1668
01:28:33,774 --> 01:28:35,639
<i>was the torture memo.</i>

1669
01:28:35,641 --> 01:28:37,744
...your fucking contact is!

1670
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:40,112
Where're your fucking hands?

1671
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:42,383
What about
the Geneva Convention?

1672
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:45,450
The Geneva Convention
is open to interpretation.

1673
01:28:45,452 --> 01:28:47,152
What exactly does that mean?

1674
01:28:47,154 --> 01:28:49,953
Stress positions,

1675
01:28:49,955 --> 01:28:51,590
waterboarding,
confided spaces, dogs...

1676
01:28:51,592 --> 01:28:53,361
We're calling it
"enhanced interrogation."

1677
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,859
Are we sure
none of this fits

1678
01:28:55,861 --> 01:28:57,595
in the definition
of "torture"?

1679
01:28:57,597 --> 01:28:58,929
The US doesn't torture.

1680
01:28:58,931 --> 01:29:03,067
Therefore,
if the US does it,

1681
01:29:03,069 --> 01:29:06,103
by definition,
it can't be torture.

1682
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,843
<i>But torture and privacy laws</i>

1683
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:14,645
<i>weren't the only laws Cheney
re-wrote with John Yoo.</i>

1684
01:29:14,647 --> 01:29:17,816
<i>They had a full menu
of legal opinions</i>

1685
01:29:17,818 --> 01:29:19,984
<i>stretching and challenging
constitutional</i>

1686
01:29:19,986 --> 01:29:21,786
<i>and international law.</i>

1687
01:29:21,788 --> 01:29:23,688
Good evening, gentlemen.

1688
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:26,791
Tonight we're offering
the enemy combatant,

1689
01:29:26,793 --> 01:29:29,228
whereby a person
is not a prisoner of war,

1690
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:31,130
or a criminal,
which means of course

1691
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:33,831
that he has absolutely
no protection under the law.

1692
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:36,367
We're also offering
an extraordinary rendition

1693
01:29:36,369 --> 01:29:39,937
where suspects are abducted
without record on foreign soil

1694
01:29:39,939 --> 01:29:41,439
and taken to foreign prisons

1695
01:29:41,441 --> 01:29:42,773
in countries that still torture.

1696
01:29:42,775 --> 01:29:44,509
Oh, that sounds delicious.

1697
01:29:44,511 --> 01:29:46,377
We also have Guantanamo Bay,

1698
01:29:46,379 --> 01:29:48,380
which is very,
very complicated,

1699
01:29:48,382 --> 01:29:50,014
but it does allow you
to operate

1700
01:29:50,016 --> 01:29:52,350
outside the purview
of due process

1701
01:29:52,352 --> 01:29:54,952
on land which isn't
technically US territory,

1702
01:29:54,954 --> 01:29:57,087
but where we still
do have control.

1703
01:29:57,089 --> 01:29:59,657
And also, we have
a very fresh and delicious

1704
01:29:59,659 --> 01:30:01,893
War Powers Act interpretation

1705
01:30:01,895 --> 01:30:04,028
which gives the executive
branch broad powers

1706
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:06,598
to attack nations or people

1707
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,867
who it deems
still possibly a threat.

1708
01:30:08,869 --> 01:30:11,903
We have the fact that under
the unitary executive theory,

1709
01:30:11,905 --> 01:30:13,604
if the president
does anything,

1710
01:30:13,606 --> 01:30:15,206
it must be legal.

1711
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:18,376
Which, of course, means you can
do whatever the fuck you want.

1712
01:30:18,378 --> 01:30:19,676
So, gentlemen,

1713
01:30:19,678 --> 01:30:20,778
which would you like?

1714
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:23,680
Hmm. We'll, uh,
we'll have them all.

1715
01:30:23,682 --> 01:30:25,183
Excellent choice.

1716
01:30:25,185 --> 01:30:26,220
Thank you.

1717
01:30:27,087 --> 01:30:30,287
Look, Dick,
uh, we've been working

1718
01:30:30,289 --> 01:30:32,756
with these focus groups
and advertising executives

1719
01:30:32,758 --> 01:30:34,960
to try and sell
the War on Terror.

1720
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:37,429
<i>I'll reiterate,
we are still being recorded,</i>

1721
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:39,331
<i>and there still may
or may not be clients</i>

1722
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:40,631
<i>back behind
the two-way mirrors...</i>

1723
01:30:40,633 --> 01:30:43,434
These guys are pretty sharp.

1724
01:30:43,436 --> 01:30:44,437
Go on.

1725
01:30:45,504 --> 01:30:46,772
There's a problem.

1726
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:48,305
The results show
that people are confused.

1727
01:30:48,307 --> 01:30:50,974
<i>You all support
the president,</i>

1728
01:30:50,976 --> 01:30:54,946
<i>you hate terrorism,
yet you're still confused.</i>

1729
01:30:54,948 --> 01:30:57,450
<i>Can you tell me why?
Anybody?</i>

1730
01:30:58,418 --> 01:31:01,952
<i>Don't we have to just
get Osama bin Laden? He did it.</i>

1731
01:31:01,954 --> 01:31:04,956
So why are they calling it
a war? A war with who?

1732
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:06,558
<i>Okay, thank you, Mark.</i>

1733
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,960
<i>Uh, Jasmine, jump in, please.</i>

1734
01:31:08,962 --> 01:31:11,461
I don't get what this
Al-Qaeda is.

1735
01:31:11,463 --> 01:31:14,032
Are they a country, like,
why can't we just bomb them?

1736
01:31:14,034 --> 01:31:15,466
That's really interesting.

1737
01:31:15,468 --> 01:31:19,504
Um, is anybody else confused
about what Al-Qaeda is?

1738
01:31:19,506 --> 01:31:20,872
<i>Show of hands, please.</i>

1739
01:31:20,874 --> 01:31:23,207
<i>One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...</i>

1740
01:31:23,209 --> 01:31:25,977
<i>That's a lot of you. Right?</i>

1741
01:31:25,979 --> 01:31:27,946
Would it be less confusing

1742
01:31:27,948 --> 01:31:29,447
if it was a country?

1743
01:31:29,449 --> 01:31:30,549
Damn right.

1744
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:32,019
I'm angry as hell.

1745
01:31:32,819 --> 01:31:35,553
We've gotta fuck someone up.

1746
01:31:35,555 --> 01:31:37,054
<i>Got it. Mark.</i>

1747
01:31:37,056 --> 01:31:39,191
Really strong feelings coming
from Mark. I'm interested.

1748
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:40,825
Does anybody else feel
the same or agree...

1749
01:31:40,827 --> 01:31:42,930
They understand
we're at war, but...

1750
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:45,464
they don't know
against who.

1751
01:31:45,466 --> 01:31:47,064
They want a country.

1752
01:31:47,066 --> 01:31:48,465
It's cleaner, simpler.

1753
01:31:48,467 --> 01:31:50,367
That would
certainly help us legally.

1754
01:31:50,369 --> 01:31:51,805
Hmm. Well...

1755
01:31:52,939 --> 01:31:55,142
looks like it's time
to take Iraq.

1756
01:31:56,543 --> 01:31:59,313
It is about goddamn time.

1757
01:32:02,982 --> 01:32:07,685
It's called
the Office of Special Plans.

1758
01:32:07,687 --> 01:32:10,787
Tenet is not yet
serious enough

1759
01:32:10,789 --> 01:32:13,224
about the threat
that Saddam poses

1760
01:32:13,226 --> 01:32:15,029
to the global war
on terror.

1761
01:32:16,061 --> 01:32:17,828
But I can promise you

1762
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:19,930
that this
intelligence group will be.

1763
01:32:19,932 --> 01:32:21,066
Wolfie, I got something.

1764
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:22,367
Truck transmissions.

1765
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:24,036
If there's a donkey
with a radio up his ass,

1766
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,103
I wanna know
what it's transmitting.

1767
01:32:25,105 --> 01:32:27,107
I think that's
an excellent idea.

1768
01:32:29,275 --> 01:32:31,609
I've been wantin' to take
that motherfucker Saddam down

1769
01:32:31,611 --> 01:32:33,178
- for a long time.
- Hmm.

1770
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:35,212
Here's a report
that says Mohamed Atta,

1771
01:32:35,214 --> 01:32:36,781
one of the 9-11 hijackers,

1772
01:32:36,783 --> 01:32:39,416
may have met with
an Iraqi spy in Prague.

1773
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:40,984
It's a really
strong statement.

1774
01:32:40,986 --> 01:32:42,886
Does anybody agree
with that statement?

1775
01:32:42,888 --> 01:32:45,657
Wait a minute.
We can't just bomb people.

1776
01:32:45,659 --> 01:32:46,691
- Oh, please.
- Yeah, no.

1777
01:32:46,693 --> 01:32:47,858
It's from Czech intelligence,

1778
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,626
and they question
its credibility.

1779
01:32:49,628 --> 01:32:51,862
I've been to Prague.
They question everything.

1780
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:54,866
Who wants to be
an anonymous source?

1781
01:32:54,868 --> 01:32:56,468
Make sure you work
in the phrase,

1782
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:58,402
"We don't want the smoking gun
to be a mushroom cloud."

1783
01:32:58,404 --> 01:33:00,738
That focus-grouped
through the roof.

1784
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:03,073
There will always
be uncertainty

1785
01:33:03,075 --> 01:33:06,077
about when he will acquire
nuclear weapons.

1786
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:08,580
<i>But we don't want
the smoking gun</i>

1787
01:33:08,582 --> 01:33:09,915
<i>to be a mushroom cloud.</i>

1788
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:11,950
<i>There is a smoking gun
or a mushroom cloud</i>

1789
01:33:11,952 --> 01:33:13,885
- <i>we have waited too long.</i>
- <i>Simply stated,</i>

1790
01:33:13,887 --> 01:33:16,254
<i>there is no doubt
that Saddam Hussein</i>

1791
01:33:16,256 --> 01:33:18,456
<i>now has weapons
of mass destruction.</i>

1792
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:20,325
<i>We gotta get rid
of this dictator.</i>

1793
01:33:20,327 --> 01:33:22,059
<i>He's got anthrax,
he's got all these weapons...</i>

1794
01:33:22,061 --> 01:33:24,129
<i>There is no doubt
he is amassing them</i>

1795
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:25,830
<i>to use them
against our friends,</i>

1796
01:33:25,832 --> 01:33:27,898
<i>against our allies,
and against us.</i>

1797
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:30,835
<i>When, and not if, but when</i>

1798
01:33:30,837 --> 01:33:33,537
<i>Saddam creates
and uses nuclear weapons,</i>

1799
01:33:33,539 --> 01:33:35,473
<i>what will we tell
the American people?</i>

1800
01:33:35,475 --> 01:33:39,344
<i>Saddam Hussein will continue
to increase his capacity</i>

1801
01:33:39,346 --> 01:33:41,645
<i>to wage biological
and chemical warfare.</i>

1802
01:33:41,647 --> 01:33:42,880
- Hello?
- <i>Whassup!</i>

1803
01:33:47,287 --> 01:33:50,087
To show that we will stand up
for what we know to be right,

1804
01:33:50,089 --> 01:33:52,322
to show that we will confront
the tyrannies

1805
01:33:52,324 --> 01:33:53,992
and dictatorships
and terrorists

1806
01:33:53,994 --> 01:33:55,960
who put our way of life
at risk.

1807
01:33:55,962 --> 01:33:57,828
<i>...of winning
a second UN resolution</i>

1808
01:33:57,830 --> 01:33:59,764
<i>authorizing war against Iraq.</i>

1809
01:33:59,766 --> 01:34:01,299
<i>So tonight President Bush...</i>

1810
01:34:01,301 --> 01:34:03,600
<i>...and the hopes
of an oppressed people...</i>

1811
01:34:03,602 --> 01:34:04,672
The tribe has spoken.

1812
01:34:07,473 --> 01:34:10,041
Polling for an invasion
of Iraq

1813
01:34:10,043 --> 01:34:12,176
is at 53 percent.

1814
01:34:12,178 --> 01:34:13,745
Focus groups show people

1815
01:34:13,747 --> 01:34:15,813
still aren't sure
about a connection

1816
01:34:15,815 --> 01:34:18,416
between Saddam and Al-Qaeda.

1817
01:34:18,418 --> 01:34:20,018
And France and Germany
have both said

1818
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:21,853
that they will not join
our coalition

1819
01:34:21,855 --> 01:34:23,554
And neither will Israel.

1820
01:34:23,556 --> 01:34:26,823
Ariel and I we went
to the Wall together with Condi.

1821
01:34:26,825 --> 01:34:27,992
We-we prayed together.

1822
01:34:27,994 --> 01:34:30,127
Israel's one
of our closest allies.

1823
01:34:30,129 --> 01:34:33,264
They said an invasion
of Iraq would...

1824
01:34:33,266 --> 01:34:35,500
destabilize the region, sir,

1825
01:34:35,502 --> 01:34:37,437
and that they don't believe
Saddam is an immediate threat.

1826
01:34:38,538 --> 01:34:39,938
That's not good.

1827
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:42,706
I really want
a strong coalition for this.

1828
01:34:42,708 --> 01:34:44,242
I have an idea.

1829
01:34:44,244 --> 01:34:46,176
Secretary Powell has
the highest

1830
01:34:46,178 --> 01:34:48,449
trustworthy ratings
of all of us.

1831
01:34:49,315 --> 01:34:51,616
What if he gave an address
to the UN

1832
01:34:51,618 --> 01:34:53,285
and the American people

1833
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:55,353
to push this over
the finish line?

1834
01:34:55,355 --> 01:34:57,522
Karl, I have been very vocal,

1835
01:34:57,524 --> 01:35:00,058
very vocal about my reservations
about invading Iraq.

1836
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:03,661
Oh! Colin, you're such
a nervous Nellie.

1837
01:35:03,663 --> 01:35:05,962
- We are talking about invading...
- A worry wart.

1838
01:35:05,964 --> 01:35:07,599
- ...a sovereign nation...
- Sovereign nation?

1839
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:10,001
- ...without any provocation, Don.
- Don't give me that...

1840
01:35:10,003 --> 01:35:11,402
It is a sovereign nation, Don.

1841
01:35:11,404 --> 01:35:12,970
...in any way, shape,
or form. You're wrong.

1842
01:35:12,972 --> 01:35:14,205
What's the exit strategy?

1843
01:35:14,207 --> 01:35:16,241
What, what about
the intelligence?

1844
01:35:16,243 --> 01:35:18,209
- Does the intelligence matter to you at all?
- The exit strategy. Oh, please.

1845
01:35:18,211 --> 01:35:19,676
- You break it, you bought it.
- You know you're wrong.

1846
01:35:19,678 --> 01:35:21,246
- You break it, you bought it.
- You're a chicken-shit.

1847
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:23,415
All right.
Hey, hey, hey, all right.

1848
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:24,916
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

1849
01:35:24,918 --> 01:35:26,286
Let-let's slow down.

1850
01:35:27,186 --> 01:35:28,819
That's enough of that,
you guys.

1851
01:35:28,821 --> 01:35:30,190
Well, are you...

1852
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:34,328
gonna take
Saddam down or not?

1853
01:35:35,195 --> 01:35:37,464
You are the president.

1854
01:35:40,065 --> 01:35:43,803
War... is yours.

1855
01:35:45,471 --> 01:35:49,006
Not the UN,
not some coalition.

1856
01:35:49,008 --> 01:35:51,211
Do not share powers...

1857
01:35:52,177 --> 01:35:54,080
that are yours alone.

1858
01:36:01,454 --> 01:36:04,822
George, make sure
Powell sees the intelligence.

1859
01:36:04,824 --> 01:36:06,389
Yes, sir.

1860
01:36:06,391 --> 01:36:08,526
Colin,
I want you to make that speech.

1861
01:36:08,528 --> 01:36:10,594
I'm president,
and I want this to happen.

1862
01:36:10,596 --> 01:36:11,895
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1863
01:36:11,897 --> 01:36:13,531
Yes, sir.

1864
01:36:13,533 --> 01:36:15,433
I look forward to being briefed
on that intelligence.

1865
01:36:15,435 --> 01:36:18,236
On another note, I've been
handed a credible report

1866
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:21,906
of a small terrorist enclave
in North Eastern Iraq.

1867
01:36:21,908 --> 01:36:23,006
If we're gonna invade,

1868
01:36:23,008 --> 01:36:24,608
we suggest taking it
out before.

1869
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:26,510
Let it go, George.
We have bigger fish to fry.

1870
01:36:26,512 --> 01:36:28,645
Let me see that intelligence.

1871
01:36:28,647 --> 01:36:30,348
Of course.

1872
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:33,318
<i>That classified document</i>

1873
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:37,654
<i>described a terrorist named
Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi</i>

1874
01:36:37,656 --> 01:36:40,124
<i>who had started
as a drug dealer and pimp</i>

1875
01:36:40,126 --> 01:36:41,792
<i>before becoming
fully radicalized</i>

1876
01:36:41,794 --> 01:36:43,862
<i>in a Jordanian prison.</i>

1877
01:36:43,864 --> 01:36:47,197
<i>Zarqawi went to meet
bin Laden in Afghanistan.</i>

1878
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,701
Did he or did he not meet
with Al-Qaeda?

1879
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:54,406
<i>But Zarqawi had vowed
to kill all Shia Muslims,</i>

1880
01:36:54,408 --> 01:36:57,709
<i>and bin Laden's mother
was Shia.</i>

1881
01:36:57,711 --> 01:36:59,977
<i>So the meeting
didn't go over well.</i>

1882
01:36:59,979 --> 01:37:01,679
They had
no operational contact.

1883
01:37:01,681 --> 01:37:02,746
Hogwash.

1884
01:37:02,748 --> 01:37:05,950
Larry,
have you seen this speech?

1885
01:37:05,952 --> 01:37:07,451
Yes, sir. It's bone-thin.

1886
01:37:07,453 --> 01:37:10,121
I saw at least five pieces
of disproved intel in there.

1887
01:37:10,123 --> 01:37:11,221
Who wrote it?

1888
01:37:11,223 --> 01:37:12,557
They said
it was the president,

1889
01:37:12,559 --> 01:37:14,024
but I think you can guess
who really wrote it.

1890
01:37:14,026 --> 01:37:16,262
Well, there's no need
to yell, Larry.

1891
01:37:17,096 --> 01:37:20,398
Yeah, well,
we reviewed the speech,

1892
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,336
we gave some notes.

1893
01:37:23,703 --> 01:37:27,404
Powell really doesn't have
a clue, does he?

1894
01:37:27,406 --> 01:37:30,008
<i>After the US
invaded Afghanistan,</i>

1895
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:32,576
<i>Zarqawi set up shop in Iraq.</i>

1896
01:37:32,578 --> 01:37:35,312
<i>It was the only connection
Cheney had</i>

1897
01:37:35,314 --> 01:37:37,215
<i>between Al-Qaeda and Iraq.</i>

1898
01:37:37,217 --> 01:37:39,617
<i>The Security Council
will now begin</i>

1899
01:37:39,619 --> 01:37:43,621
<i>its consideration
of item two of the agend.</i>

1900
01:37:43,623 --> 01:37:45,822
<i>I call now
on the distinguished</i>

1901
01:37:45,824 --> 01:37:47,125
<i>Secretary of State</i>

1902
01:37:47,127 --> 01:37:48,992
<i>of the United States
of America,</i>

1903
01:37:48,994 --> 01:37:51,496
<i>His Excellency,
Mr. Colin Powell.</i>

1904
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:54,331
<i>My purpose here today
is to share with you</i>

1905
01:37:54,333 --> 01:37:55,633
<i>what the United States knows</i>

1906
01:37:55,635 --> 01:37:58,803
<i>about Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction</i>

1907
01:37:58,805 --> 01:38:01,738
<i>as well as Iraq's involvement
in terrorism.</i>

1908
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:04,742
<i>Iraq, today, harbors
a deadly terrorist network</i>

1909
01:38:04,744 --> 01:38:07,679
<i>headed by
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,</i>

1910
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:09,913
<i>an associate
and collaborator...</i>

1911
01:38:09,915 --> 01:38:12,649
<i>Powell's UN address was
seen by millions of Americans,</i>

1912
01:38:12,651 --> 01:38:15,319
<i>but other people
were watching as well.</i>

1913
01:38:15,321 --> 01:38:17,188
<i>Collaborator
of Osama bin Laden</i>

1914
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:18,825
<i>and his Al-Qaeda
lieutenants...</i>

1915
01:38:19,626 --> 01:38:21,526
<i>Zarqawi's activities
are not confined...</i>

1916
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:22,859
<i>The great general of America</i>

1917
01:38:22,861 --> 01:38:24,962
<i>saying his name
over and over again</i>

1918
01:38:24,964 --> 01:38:27,430
<i>immediately made
Zarqawi a star.</i>

1919
01:38:27,432 --> 01:38:29,367
<i>Staying
in the capital of Iraq...</i>

1920
01:38:29,369 --> 01:38:30,667
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

1921
01:38:30,669 --> 01:38:33,071
<i>Within a day,
he had gone into hiding.</i>

1922
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:35,805
<i>Allahu Akbar!
Allahu Akbar!</i>

1923
01:38:35,807 --> 01:38:39,010
<i>...but these denials
are simply not credible.</i>

1924
01:38:39,012 --> 01:38:41,379
<i>They are simply not credible.</i>

1925
01:38:41,381 --> 01:38:43,648
<i>An Al-Qaeda source
tells us that</i>

1926
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:45,916
<i>Saddam and bin Laden
reached an understanding</i>

1927
01:38:45,918 --> 01:38:48,185
<i>that Al-Qaeda would no longer</i>

1928
01:38:48,187 --> 01:38:50,522
<i>support activities
against Baghdad.</i>

1929
01:38:50,524 --> 01:38:52,288
<i>By the time we invaded Iraq,</i>

1930
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:54,492
<i>70 percent
of Americans thought</i>

1931
01:38:54,494 --> 01:38:57,297
<i>that Saddam Hussein
was involved in 9-11.</i>

1932
01:38:58,765 --> 01:39:02,198
<i>Later, Colin Powell
would call the speech</i>

1933
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,001
<i>the most painful moment
of his life.</i>

1934
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:08,874
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

1935
01:39:10,575 --> 01:39:12,408
<i>And what was it?
Justin, right?</i>

1936
01:39:12,410 --> 01:39:13,810
<i>She can buy
her album now, Mom.</i>

1937
01:39:13,812 --> 01:39:15,679
What was
the girl's name that won?

1938
01:39:15,681 --> 01:39:17,782
- No, Kelly. And then Justin.
- Last year.

1939
01:39:17,784 --> 01:39:19,383
What are you talking about?

1940
01:39:19,385 --> 01:39:21,318
We're talking about
<i>American Idol,</i> Dad.

1941
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,420
What is that?

1942
01:39:22,422 --> 01:39:23,787
We watched it.
You've seen it.

1943
01:39:23,789 --> 01:39:26,191
- You've seen it...
- I've watched it next to you.

1944
01:39:26,193 --> 01:39:28,024
The singing, and the
mean judge, and the...

1945
01:39:28,026 --> 01:39:29,426
I don't like that...

1946
01:39:29,428 --> 01:39:31,027
- The mean British judge?
- You liked it.

1947
01:39:31,029 --> 01:39:32,697
- You liked the mean British...
- Oh, I like him.

1948
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:33,734
Yeah, you...

1949
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:36,533
Do you know how
to stop a fish from smelling?

1950
01:39:36,535 --> 01:39:37,934
Very appropriate.

1951
01:39:37,936 --> 01:39:41,005
That's not a...
That's a terrible joke.

1952
01:39:41,007 --> 01:39:42,572
Well, I didn't finish it yet.

1953
01:39:42,574 --> 01:39:44,073
I mean, everybody.

1954
01:39:44,075 --> 01:39:46,376
You cut off its nose.

1955
01:39:46,378 --> 01:39:48,513
Wait, what?

1956
01:39:48,515 --> 01:39:50,514
I know, Grace,
cover your ears please.

1957
01:39:50,516 --> 01:39:53,617
- Cheers, honey.
- Cheers. Oh, my gosh.

1958
01:39:53,619 --> 01:39:55,286
- We're not.
- No, we're not.

1959
01:39:55,288 --> 01:39:56,621
We're not revisiting

1960
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:59,691
your father's
colorful conversations...

1961
01:39:59,693 --> 01:40:01,628
Let's just say
that your dad...

1962
01:40:11,471 --> 01:40:13,438
<i>Again, another,</i>

1963
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,775
<i>disintegrating...</i>

1964
01:40:22,281 --> 01:40:24,415
Is the prompter
visible for you?

1965
01:40:24,417 --> 01:40:28,185
Yeah, yeah. Bring it
a little closer. Yeah.

1966
01:40:28,187 --> 01:40:30,153
How's my hair? All right?

1967
01:40:30,155 --> 01:40:32,256
- Looks good.
- Tie?

1968
01:40:32,258 --> 01:40:35,662
And we are five,
four, three...

1969
01:40:36,596 --> 01:40:38,996
My fellow citizens,
at this hour,

1970
01:40:38,998 --> 01:40:40,865
American and coalition forces

1971
01:40:40,867 --> 01:40:44,568
are in the early stages
of military operations

1972
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:47,737
to disarm Iraq,
to free its people

1973
01:40:47,739 --> 01:40:50,176
and to defend the world
from grave danger.

1974
01:40:51,078 --> 01:40:54,411
On my orders, coalition forces
have begun striking

1975
01:40:54,413 --> 01:40:57,415
selected targets
of military importance

1976
01:40:57,417 --> 01:41:00,117
to undermine
Saddam Hussein's ability

1977
01:41:00,119 --> 01:41:01,719
to wage war.

1978
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:03,854
These are opening stages
of what will be

1979
01:41:03,856 --> 01:41:07,325
a broad
and concerted campaign.

1980
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:10,426
To all the men and women of
the United States Armed Forces

1981
01:41:10,428 --> 01:41:12,429
now in the Middle East,

1982
01:41:12,431 --> 01:41:14,531
the peace of a troubled world

1983
01:41:14,533 --> 01:41:17,602
and the hopes
of an oppressed people...

1984
01:41:48,434 --> 01:41:50,166
Guys, over here.
Two o'clock.

1985
01:41:50,168 --> 01:41:51,568
Contact, two hundred yards.

1986
01:41:54,673 --> 01:41:56,206
<i>This statement
from the White House,</i>

1987
01:41:56,208 --> 01:41:59,777
<i>President Bush regards this
as an historic moment.</i>

1988
01:41:59,779 --> 01:42:01,578
<i>The scenes on television show</i>

1989
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:04,948
<i>the thirst for freedom
is unquenchable.</i>

1990
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:06,517
<i>Striker One L-S-O,</i>

1991
01:42:06,519 --> 01:42:07,887
<i>You are clear to land.</i>

1992
01:42:19,498 --> 01:42:23,703
USA! USA! USA!

1993
01:42:25,171 --> 01:42:26,440
<i>Good work.</i>

1994
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,512
Hi. Um...

1995
01:42:33,846 --> 01:42:37,180
It seems like they've been
shipping men and equipment

1996
01:42:37,182 --> 01:42:39,485
out of Afghanistan, into Iraq,

1997
01:42:40,852 --> 01:42:43,955
and at the moment,
we're a little unsure

1998
01:42:43,957 --> 01:42:45,992
of what's going on.

1999
01:42:48,261 --> 01:42:51,698
I don't want you
to worry about me.

2000
01:42:58,605 --> 01:43:02,372
<i>Major combat operations
in Iraq have ended.</i>

2001
01:43:02,374 --> 01:43:04,008
<i>In the battle of Iraq,</i>

2002
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:07,180
<i>the United States
and our allies have prevailed.</i>

2003
01:43:08,346 --> 01:43:10,682
We have concerns
over Halliburton KBR's

2004
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:11,950
billing practices.

2005
01:43:12,717 --> 01:43:15,118
As you know, the no-bid
contracts they received

2006
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:16,955
were quite sizable, and now...

2007
01:43:16,957 --> 01:43:19,456
Well, we're not concerned,
are we?

2008
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:20,392
Not at all.

2009
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:23,760
The secretary of defense
and the vice president

2010
01:43:23,762 --> 01:43:25,598
just said
they're not concerned.

2011
01:43:26,432 --> 01:43:28,133
Now, can we please talk
about Iran?

2012
01:43:40,113 --> 01:43:43,546
<i>To this day, Dick Cheney
has never apologized</i>

2013
01:43:43,548 --> 01:43:44,849
<i>for this incident.</i>

2014
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:47,617
Jesus, Dick!

2015
01:43:47,619 --> 01:43:49,687
- <i>But someone else did.</i>
- Oh, hell.

2016
01:43:49,689 --> 01:43:52,790
<i>My family and I
are deeply sorry</i>

2017
01:43:52,792 --> 01:43:54,791
<i>for all that
Vice President Cheney</i>

2018
01:43:54,793 --> 01:43:56,527
<i>and his family
have had to go through</i>

2019
01:43:56,529 --> 01:43:58,094
<i>this past week.</i>

2020
01:43:58,096 --> 01:44:00,699
<i>We send our love
and respect to them.</i>

2021
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:04,337
<i>And we hope that he will
continue to come to Texas...</i>

2022
01:44:05,305 --> 01:44:08,074
<i>and seek the relaxation
that he deserves.</i>

2023
01:44:09,641 --> 01:44:11,810
So, this, uh...

2024
01:44:13,044 --> 01:44:16,947
Joe Wilson asshole...

2025
01:44:16,949 --> 01:44:18,381
...is questioning
our intelligence

2026
01:44:18,383 --> 01:44:20,086
in the <i>New York Times.</i>

2027
01:44:21,721 --> 01:44:23,857
What's his wife's name again?

2028
01:44:25,057 --> 01:44:26,724
Valerie Plame.

2029
01:44:26,726 --> 01:44:29,262
I confirmed it.
She's undercover CIA.

2030
01:44:30,428 --> 01:44:31,664
Leak it.

2031
01:44:47,445 --> 01:44:49,013
Okay, okay.

2032
01:44:49,015 --> 01:44:50,715
Like, they don't care
about their dogs, man.

2033
01:44:50,717 --> 01:44:52,616
I mean they shoot 'em.
They let 'em roam wild.

2034
01:44:52,618 --> 01:44:54,053
What kinda man
don't love a dog?

2035
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:56,252
People in India love cows.

2036
01:44:56,254 --> 01:44:57,654
They look at us

2037
01:44:57,656 --> 01:44:59,357
and how we treat cows
and think the same thing.

2038
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:01,291
Cows. All due respect...

2039
01:45:01,293 --> 01:45:03,797
that sounds like some liberal
ass-scratchin' bullshit...

2040
01:45:12,538 --> 01:45:14,107
Linda.

2041
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:18,675
Look at this crap.

2042
01:45:18,677 --> 01:45:19,876
God damn it.

2043
01:45:19,878 --> 01:45:21,146
Hello, Don.

2044
01:45:22,248 --> 01:45:24,348
That report says Zarqawi,

2045
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:27,018
the same fucking Zarqawi
we talked up for months,

2046
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:30,187
is now leading
a major insurgence in Iraq.

2047
01:45:30,189 --> 01:45:33,558
And the implication is
it's because we talked him up.

2048
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,224
Has POTUS seen this?

2049
01:45:35,226 --> 01:45:36,426
No, no, no.

2050
01:45:36,428 --> 01:45:39,729
I... I intercepted it before
it got across the hallway.

2051
01:45:39,731 --> 01:45:41,932
And this is,

2053
01:45:44,302 --> 01:45:45,335
This stops here.

<i>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</i>

2055
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:50,041
<i>had taken his fame
from Powell's UN speech</i>

2056
01:45:50,043 --> 01:45:52,578
<i>and turned it
into his own new thing.</i>

somehow found itself</i>

2060

<i>on the bottom
of a stack of papers...</i>

2061
01:46:05,624 --> 01:46:06,991
<i>Zarqawi had a whole year</i>

2062
01:46:06,993 --> 01:46:09,763
<i>to just do whatever
the hell he wanted.</i>

2063
01:46:10,596 --> 01:46:11,997
<i>And what he wanted...</i>

2064
01:46:13,231 --> 01:46:14,667
<i>was carnage.</i>

2065
01:46:16,168 --> 01:46:17,836
<i>Shia versus Sunni.</i>

2066
01:46:19,672 --> 01:46:21,675
<i>The West versus Islam.</i>

2067
01:46:23,876 --> 01:46:26,212
<i>And death versus life.</i>

2068
01:46:27,579 --> 01:46:28,880
<i>And on top of that,</i>

2069

<i>US forces couldn't find
any WMDs</i>

2070

<i>or nuclear programs in Iraq.</i>

2071
01:46:33,985 --> 01:46:36,286
<i>Turns out that Saddam
and his sons</i>

2072
01:46:36,288 --> 01:46:37,787
<i>mostly liked cocaine</i>

2073
01:46:37,789 --> 01:46:40,224

Look, I hope there's
no hard feelings

2082

about us investigating
the no-bid Iraq contract

for Halliburton.

2084

You know,
I'm just doing my job.

2085
01:47:03,315 --> 01:47:04,751

<i>for the Washington Nationals.</i>

2092

<i>But there's continued buildup,
Eddie, for this team</i>

2093
01:47:30,109 --> 01:47:32,643
<i>because of the success
they had last year</i>

2094

pretty good numbers.</i>

2095
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,353
<i>Dick Cheney,
a little bit low and outside.</i>

<i>Iraq War,
now proven to be false.</i>

<i>These issues may
not be resolved for some time.</i>

2100
01:47:55,101 --> 01:47:56,236
Go away!

2101
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:05,709
I swear to God

2102
01:48:05,711 --> 01:48:07,981
this whole place

- <i>Where are you?</i>
- <i>I'm in an empty office</i>

2105
01:48:15,587 --> 01:48:18,822
<i>Listen, if we could just get</i>

2106
01:48:18,824 --> 01:48:20,157
an air bombardment in Iraq,

2107
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:21,959
I think it would make
a statement

2108
01:48:21,961 --> 01:48:23,827
<i>and it would give us
some political cover.</i>

2109
01:48:23,829 --> 01:48:25,694
It's over, Don.

2110
01:48:25,696 --> 01:48:26,800
<i>What's that?</i>

2111
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,399
What is?

2112
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:30,701
<i>It's over.</i>

2113
01:48:30,703 --> 01:48:31,969
<i>President wants you
to step down.</i>

2114
01:48:31,971 --> 01:48:33,540
<i>He appreciates your service.</i>

2115
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:40,946
Don?

2116
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:46,817
Well, does, uh...

2117
01:48:46,819 --> 01:48:49,189
Bush's kid want me out
or do you?

2118
01:48:52,624 --> 01:48:54,157
I can't win every fight, Don.

2119
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:56,061
You are a little piece
of shit.

2120
01:48:58,463 --> 01:49:01,501
<i>Wow. How did you become
such a cold son of a bitch?</i>

2121
01:49:02,502 --> 01:49:03,570
<i>I'm sorry, Don.</i>

2122
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:06,105
<i>I really am.</i>

2123
01:49:08,007 --> 01:49:10,076
<i>Well, you know
how I know you're not?</i>

2124
01:49:11,811 --> 01:49:13,246
'Cause I wouldn't be.

2125
01:49:19,551 --> 01:49:21,087
Think they'll prosecute us?

2126
01:49:25,824 --> 01:49:27,193
Okay, then.

2127
01:49:30,462 --> 01:49:31,496
Okay, then.

2128
01:49:53,084 --> 01:49:55,954
<i>I, Barack Hussein Obama,
do solemnly swear...</i>

2129
01:49:56,756 --> 01:49:59,121
<i>That I will execute the office</i>

2130
01:49:59,123 --> 01:50:01,826
<i>of president to
the United States faithfully.</i>

2131
01:50:08,967 --> 01:50:10,834
Few years later,

2132
01:50:10,836 --> 01:50:13,071
Dick's heart trouble
started up again.

2133
01:50:13,972 --> 01:50:16,273
And with no donor available,

2134
01:50:16,275 --> 01:50:19,545
he finally found himself
at death's door.

2135
01:50:26,052 --> 01:50:27,287
Well?

2136
01:50:28,087 --> 01:50:31,188
I wish I had...
I had better news.

2137
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:33,657
Your heart just isn't pumping
enough oxygen

2138
01:50:33,659 --> 01:50:35,228
to keep
your vital organs alive.

2139
01:50:37,797 --> 01:50:39,630
Should I call for a minister?

2140
01:50:39,632 --> 01:50:42,969
No, no.
He's not going anywhere.

2141
01:50:45,471 --> 01:50:47,106
Okay, then.

2142
01:50:50,043 --> 01:50:51,508
Dick Cheney,

2143
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:54,480
you are not going anywhere,
do you hear me?

2144
01:50:55,248 --> 01:50:56,846
You're not going anywhere.

2145
01:50:56,848 --> 01:50:58,184
This may be the, uh...

2146
01:50:59,517 --> 01:51:00,917
one time, I, uh,

2147
01:51:00,919 --> 01:51:02,087
I can't do...

2148
01:51:03,221 --> 01:51:05,357
what your mother says, girls.

2149
01:51:15,601 --> 01:51:17,437
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you, Mary.

2150
01:51:18,537 --> 01:51:20,737
I love you, Lizzie.

2151
01:51:20,739 --> 01:51:23,009
And we love you so much.

2152
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:25,742
We love you so much.

2153
01:51:25,744 --> 01:51:27,180
My girls.

2154
01:51:33,052 --> 01:51:34,654
I love you, girls.

2155
01:51:48,499 --> 01:51:53,269
So Dick Cheney told his family
that he was ready to die

2156
01:51:53,271 --> 01:51:55,339
and that he wasn't afraid.

2157
01:51:55,341 --> 01:51:58,742
He told them
he had lived a full life

2158
01:51:58,744 --> 01:52:00,077
and that
he had zero regrets...

2159
01:52:52,263 --> 01:52:55,200
Vice President Cheney,
cross your arms, please.

2160
01:52:56,334 --> 01:52:59,169
There you go.
Okay, on a count of three.

2161
01:52:59,171 --> 01:53:00,807
One, two, three.

2162
01:53:03,876 --> 01:53:07,146
They say my heart could
give him another ten years.

2163
01:53:08,547 --> 01:53:12,683
Cheney doesn't like to refer
to it as someone else's heart.

2164
01:53:12,685 --> 01:53:15,521
He likes to refer to it
as his new heart.

2165
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:19,492
Which, even though I'm dead,
I have to say...

2166
01:53:20,592 --> 01:53:22,728
still makes me feel
pretty shitty.

2167
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:28,230
<i>And so, when Liz decided
to run for one</i>

2168
01:53:28,232 --> 01:53:30,300
<i>of Wyoming's
two Senate seats</i>

2169
01:53:30,302 --> 01:53:33,903
<i>against Republican incumbent
Mike Enzi,</i>

2170
01:53:33,905 --> 01:53:35,572
<i>our Dick was right there</i>

2171
01:53:35,574 --> 01:53:39,009
<i>to hopefully see the Cheney
legacy of power continue.</i>

2172
01:53:39,011 --> 01:53:42,179
<i>Are you aware Wyoming
Senate candidate Liz Cheney</i>

2173
01:53:42,181 --> 01:53:43,612
<i>supports gay marriage?</i>

2174
01:53:43,614 --> 01:53:45,416
<i>Her sister is married
to another woman,</i>

2175
01:53:45,418 --> 01:53:47,450
<i>and Liz Cheney refuses
to support</i>

2176
01:53:47,452 --> 01:53:50,886
<i>a constitutional amendment
banning same-sex marriage.</i>

2177
01:53:50,888 --> 01:53:52,154
<i>Instead, she equivocates,</i>

2178
01:53:52,156 --> 01:53:54,057
<i>claiming it's a states
rights issue.</i>

2179
01:53:54,059 --> 01:53:55,724
<i>Don't you agree
Wyoming deserves</i>

2180
01:53:55,726 --> 01:53:58,260
<i>a senator who believes
marriage should be</i>

2181
01:53:58,262 --> 01:53:59,763
<i>between a man and a woman?</i>

2182
01:53:59,765 --> 01:54:02,200
These calls went
to every house in Wyoming.

2183
01:54:03,269 --> 01:54:04,870
Every single house.

2184
01:54:08,039 --> 01:54:09,475
I will never win.

2185
01:54:11,909 --> 01:54:13,445
What are we gonna do?

2186
01:54:16,882 --> 01:54:19,151
O2 monitor is steady.

2187
01:54:21,553 --> 01:54:23,786
We're joined
here today by Liz Cheney,

2188
01:54:23,788 --> 01:54:27,023
who is running for the Senate
from the state of Wyoming.

2189
01:54:27,025 --> 01:54:28,392
According to one poll,

2190
01:54:28,394 --> 01:54:31,161
she is behind
by double digits.

2191
01:54:31,163 --> 01:54:32,328
Welcome.

2192
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:33,429
Thank you
for having me here, Chris.

2193
01:54:33,431 --> 01:54:34,697
Great to be with you.

2194
01:54:34,699 --> 01:54:36,066
And may I point out,
there are other polls

2195
01:54:36,068 --> 01:54:38,135
that have me much closer.

2196
01:54:38,137 --> 01:54:39,602
<i>Your opponent,
Senator Mike Enzi,</i>

2197
01:54:39,604 --> 01:54:42,738
<i>claims that you support
gay marriage</i>

2198
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:44,707
<i>in part, because...</i>

2199
01:54:44,709 --> 01:54:47,443
<i>you support your gay sister
Mary's union with her wife.</i>

2200
01:54:47,445 --> 01:54:48,879
I think
she's coming off very well.

2201
01:54:48,881 --> 01:54:49,880
<i>How do you respond?</i>

2202
01:54:49,882 --> 01:54:52,785
<i>Let me be very, very clear.</i>

2203
01:54:54,186 --> 01:54:57,720
<i>I do not support gay marriage.</i>

2204
01:54:57,722 --> 01:55:01,658
<i>I believe that marriage
is between a man and a woma.</i>

2205
01:55:01,660 --> 01:55:03,093
<i>But you've always claimed</i>

2206
01:55:03,095 --> 01:55:04,760
<i>gay marriage is a state issue.</i>

2207
01:55:04,762 --> 01:55:08,197
<i>Your opponent claims
this is an equivocation.</i>

2208
01:55:08,199 --> 01:55:09,700
All right,
I'm cutting the aorta.

2209
01:55:09,702 --> 01:55:11,201
Do you have
the specimen bowl ready?

2210
01:55:11,203 --> 01:55:12,635
It's on the field.

2211
01:55:12,637 --> 01:55:14,470
All right.
Here's the heart.

2212
01:55:14,472 --> 01:55:15,738
The thing is, Mom, I know
that Liz wouldn't have done

2213
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:17,874
any of this if you
and Dad didn't approve.

2214
01:55:17,876 --> 01:55:19,276
So...

2215
01:55:19,278 --> 01:55:20,676
I can't believe
you would do th...

2216
01:55:20,678 --> 01:55:22,444
I really thought
there was a limit to...

2217
01:55:22,446 --> 01:55:24,982
No, now you're
just being hysterical,

2218
01:55:24,984 --> 01:55:27,149
and I can't talk to you
when you get this way.

2219
01:55:27,151 --> 01:55:30,420
You need to settle down. Okay?

2220
01:55:30,422 --> 01:55:32,022
You're being hysterical.

2221
01:55:32,024 --> 01:55:34,256
Bypass is on standby.

2222
01:55:34,258 --> 01:55:35,791
Is it in three?

2223
01:55:35,793 --> 01:55:37,363
I'll have it
waiting right here.

2224
01:56:12,364 --> 01:56:14,831
All right,
some suction. Some suction.

2225
01:56:14,833 --> 01:56:16,035
Damn.

2226
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:50,369
All right. We're almost there.

2227
01:57:04,016 --> 01:57:05,051
Dad.

2228
01:57:25,369 --> 01:57:27,872
Just breathe, baby.
I love you.

2229
01:58:27,632 --> 01:58:29,568
Patient's heart rate is stable.

2230
01:58:30,534 --> 01:58:32,069
Blood pressure increasing.

2231
01:58:33,004 --> 01:58:35,404
I'm gonna notify the family.
What should I tell them?

2232
01:58:35,406 --> 01:58:37,040
Tell them
the patient's doing well.

2233
01:58:37,042 --> 01:58:39,108
- Okay.
- We should be done in a half-hour.

2234
01:59:11,243 --> 01:59:12,575
<i>Mr. Vice President.</i>

2235
01:59:12,577 --> 01:59:14,344
<i>This must be
the right place.</i>

2236
01:59:14,346 --> 01:59:15,711
<i>Yes.</i>

2237
01:59:15,713 --> 01:59:17,479
- <i>Hello, Martha.</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

2238
01:59:17,481 --> 01:59:18,782
- <i>Nice to meet you.</i>
- <i>Pleasure.</i>

2239
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:21,617
Have a seat right there.

2240
01:59:21,619 --> 01:59:26,490
So, um, is it gonna be just,
uh, me on camera or...

2241
01:59:26,492 --> 01:59:29,024
Primarily you.
We'll cut back to me.

2242
01:59:29,026 --> 01:59:30,493
<i>Eddie's got you
with the A camera.</i>

2243
01:59:30,495 --> 01:59:32,528
I'm just gonna be...
All right.

2244
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:04,230
- Ready?
- Hmm.

2245
02:00:06,464 --> 02:00:07,863
Two-thirds of Americans say

2246
02:00:07,865 --> 02:00:11,401
the Iraq War
is not worth fighting.

2247
02:00:11,403 --> 02:00:13,804
And they're looking
at the value gained

2248
02:00:13,806 --> 02:00:16,072
versus the cost
in American lives

2249
02:00:16,074 --> 02:00:17,506
and Iraqi lives.

2250
02:00:17,508 --> 02:00:18,810
So?

2251
02:00:20,110 --> 02:00:23,615
So, don't you care what
the American people think?

2252
02:00:24,748 --> 02:00:28,550
No, uh,
I think you, uh,

2253
02:00:28,552 --> 02:00:31,219
cannot be, uh,

2254
02:00:31,221 --> 02:00:32,724
blown off course.

2255
02:00:41,565 --> 02:00:45,703
I can feel
your recriminations...

2256
02:00:47,038 --> 02:00:48,172
and your judgment...

2257
02:00:49,207 --> 02:00:50,776
and I am fine with it.

2258
02:00:53,212 --> 02:00:56,549
You want to be loved,
go be a movie star.

2259
02:00:58,615 --> 02:01:01,751
The world is as you find it.

2260
02:01:01,753 --> 02:01:04,755
You gotta deal
with that reality.

2261
02:01:04,757 --> 02:01:07,490
And there are monsters
in this world.

2262
02:01:07,492 --> 02:01:12,828
We saw 3,000 innocent people

2263
02:01:12,830 --> 02:01:15,831
burned to death
by those monsters.

2264
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:17,569
And yet you object...

2265
02:01:18,403 --> 02:01:19,801
when I refuse

2266
02:01:19,803 --> 02:01:22,337
to kiss those monsters
on the cheek

2267
02:01:22,339 --> 02:01:24,706
and say "pretty please."

2268
02:01:24,708 --> 02:01:26,143
You answer me this.

2269
02:01:26,145 --> 02:01:30,947
What terrorist attack
would you have let go forward

2270
02:01:30,949 --> 02:01:35,320
so you wouldn't seem like
a mean and nasty fella?

2271
02:01:36,922 --> 02:01:39,158
I will not apologize...

2272
02:01:40,592 --> 02:01:42,294
for keeping your family safe.

2273
02:01:43,595 --> 02:01:45,396
And I will not apologize...

2274
02:01:46,164 --> 02:01:48,934
for doing what needed
to be done...

2275
02:01:50,334 --> 02:01:52,368
so that your loved ones

2276
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:54,073
can sleep peaceably at night.

2277
02:02:01,413 --> 02:02:02,781
Has been my honor...

2278
02:02:04,149 --> 02:02:05,351
to be your servant.

2279
02:02:07,552 --> 02:02:08,921
You chose me...

2280
02:02:10,489 --> 02:02:13,392
and I did what you asked.

Sorry to interrupt,
But Mark wanted

2302
02:05:08,732 --> 02:05:10,099
to share something
with everyone.

2303
02:05:10,101 --> 02:05:12,702
Something's been bothering me
this whole movie,

2304
02:05:12,704 --> 02:05:14,770
and I just figured it out.

2305
02:05:14,772 --> 02:05:16,673
The whole thing's liberal.

2306
02:05:16,675 --> 02:05:18,474
It's got a liberal bias.

2307
02:05:18,476 --> 02:05:21,046
Interesting. Does anyone else
feel that way?

2308
02:05:22,047 --> 02:05:24,680
One, two, three, four people.
Yeah, go ahead.

2309
02:05:24,682 --> 02:05:26,916
It's all facts. Right?

2310
02:05:26,918 --> 02:05:30,385
I mean, they had to vet all this with
a lawyer. How does that make it...

2311
02:05:30,387 --> 02:05:33,889
- What's liberal about that?
- You would say that, lib-tard.

2312
02:05:33,891 --> 02:05:35,523
Okay, I'm sorry.

2313
02:05:35,525 --> 02:05:37,827
So, because I have the ability
to understand facts,

2314
02:05:37,829 --> 02:05:39,027
that makes me a liberal?

2315
02:05:39,029 --> 02:05:40,563
Okay, guys,
let's just take it down.

2316
02:05:40,565 --> 02:05:42,398
You probably like Hillary.

2317
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:44,134
- Let's take it down a notch or two, okay?
- Idiot.

2318
02:05:44,136 --> 02:05:46,501
Okay, first of all,
Hillary's not president. Okay?

2319
02:05:46,503 --> 02:05:49,471
The-the-the orange Cheeto
that you hired

2320
02:05:49,473 --> 02:05:50,906
is the president
and he's ruining the country...

2321
02:05:50,908 --> 02:05:52,942
Trump is the best thing
in this country.

2322
02:05:52,944 --> 02:05:54,010
You chicken-shit!

2323
02:05:54,012 --> 02:05:55,844
<i>John! Now, come in, please.</i>

2324
02:05:55,846 --> 02:05:57,279
<i>Hey, guys, come on.</i>

2325
02:05:57,281 --> 02:06:00,215
- Guys! Guys!
- <i>Stop it. Knock it off!</i>

2326
02:06:00,217 --> 02:06:01,951
I can't wait to see the new
<i>Fast and the Furious</i> movie.

2327
02:06:01,953 --> 02:06:03,622
That looks lit.

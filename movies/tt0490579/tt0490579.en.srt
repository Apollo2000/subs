2
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,673
Why are we here again?

3
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,175
Inspiration.

4
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,688
Seriously, why are we here?

5
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,157
Clears my head.

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,662
We're writing a children's book.

7
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,200
Shh! It's starting.

8
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,201
"The Sailor"?

9
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,400
Knock it off.

10
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,047
Do you think
that's the sailor?

11
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,104
Shh.

12
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,583
Wait, I'm-
I'm trying to follow it.

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,383
Come on, beat it, sister.

14
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,859
I ain't got no time for no hookers.

15
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,419
I should be insulted.
I'm not a hooker.

16
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,862
Hey!

17
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,463
Can I take your coat, Captain?

18
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,205
Look, baby, I ain't no captain.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,180
I'm an able-bodied seaman.

20
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,773
Able-bodied. You dig?

21
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,250
Oh, my God.
- Got it.

22
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,982
Today we'll find out
just how able-bodied you really are.

23
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,489
What is happening?

24
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,719
Shut up.
You're wrecking it.

25
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,385
That's impossible.

26
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,920
Take off your clothes.

27
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,959
Kinda remind me of a woman
who I met in my last port of call...

28
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,503
Hong Kong.

29
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,334
Boy, did she have the prettiest cu-

30
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,163
Come on! Jesus!

31
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,810
You could still get a girl like that.

32
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,975
You think so?

33
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,177
Mmm.

34
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,742
Ooh.

35
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,185
Oh, goddamn it, Henry!

36
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,348
You're not even watching
the goddamn movie.

37
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,914
I think we've seen
this one before.

38
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,428
Henry, will you come
and sit here like a normal person?

39
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,020
It's defeatist, what you're doing.

40
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,531
You're defeating the whole point
of what we got going here.

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,828
Shut the fuck up, man!

42
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,163
You shut up!

43
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,397
Goddamn pervert.

44
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,670
I don't understand why
you think this would help.

45
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,372
Just watch the movie.

46
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,745
Do it to me.

47
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,613
Mmm.

48
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,549
Oh, do I need
a close-up of that.

49
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,485
- Ugh.
- Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,920
Oh.

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,548
Oh, good Lord.

52
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,614
Oh.

53
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,159
Mmm.

54
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,593
Touch my beaver.

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,995
Ooh. Ah.

56
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,938
Let's go. Let's go!

57
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,442
A beaver. It's a winner.

58
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,173
I mean, what kid
doesn't like beavers?

59
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,273
I got that thing that I get when
I get a feeling about something.

60
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,476
"Muff the Beaver"?

61
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,645
Nah. Too on the nose.

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,051
"Marty the Beaver"?

63
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,024
"Marty the Beaver. "

64
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,592
Hey.

65
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,200
This guy is so
not gonna go for this.

66
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,496
Pessimist son of a bitch.

67
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,338
Mr. Planck will be with you
in just one minute, gentlemen.

68
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,883
Allison either wants me to move
into the living room to sleep,

69
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,856
or she wants to get engaged.

70
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,290
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

71
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,789
The reason people
get together now is...

72
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,698
because they think they're looking
for similarly broken people.

73
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,531
We communicate nowadays
through- through damage.

74
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,804
But, fortunately for you,
she's fake-damaged,

75
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,572
and she's gonna leave you
and have a better life

76
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:10,377
with some dope like her
who just pretends to be all fucked up.

77
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,651
Girls only like the really fucked-up guy
for the first few months.

78
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,953
They prefer...
you know, fake-broken.

79
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,686
Complicated, but like...

80
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,092
talk-about-it-over-chardonnay
complicated.

81
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,597
Ooh.

82
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:29,957
Life.

83
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,799
Don't start. Life's fine.

84
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,299
Life is nothing but the echo of joy

85
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,937
disappearing into
the great chasm of misery.

86
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,679
You've had better.

87
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,245
Life is nothing
but the occasional burst of laughter

88
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,290
rising above
the interminable wail of grief.

89
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,346
That's my favorite.

90
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,620
It lives in truth, that's why.

91
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,254
He's- he's not
necessarily a "bad" beaver.

92
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,319
Nah.

93
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,922
And he's not really
a "good" beaver, either.

94
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,830
He's an edgy kind of beaver.

95
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,562
No, no. More he's- he's like a...

96
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,400
a beaver with an edge.

97
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,167
All right, let's see.

98
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,640
Show him.

99
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,242
All right, how's this?

100
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,782
That's the actual beaver?

101
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,646
Yeah, this is... this is Marty.

102
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,210
Mm-hmm?

103
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,280
Beavers make dams.

104
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,622
Yes, I- I'm aware.

105
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,753
I didn't know that.

106
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,818
Mm-hmm.

107
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,024
Yeah, there- there's
a thaw in- in the snow,

108
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,897
and it doesn't look
as if the dam is gonna hold.

109
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:41,099
So, Marty, in a selfless effort
to save the pond,

110
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,665
breaks into every house in town.

111
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,005
Breaks in?

112
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,878
No, he- he gnaws in.
He- he's a beaver.

113
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:55,887
All right, so, um- so, he drags
the trees back to the stream.

114
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,753
Meanwhile, the people
from the town come up,

115
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:03,762
and they- they- they're
fixin' to make some beaver stew.

116
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,799
But, cooler heads prevail.

117
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,993
Someone stab me in the ear.

118
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,765
They plug the trees into the dam
and call it a Christmas dam.

119
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,172
And, all Christmas day,
the people from the town-

120
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,268
they make the biggest
and the strongest dam

121
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,006
that the beavers have ever seen.

122
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,776
It killed us to write that last part,

123
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,613
but we... you know,
need the money.

124
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,209
He's got three alimony payments,

125
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,255
and I got a girlfriend we've decided
I need to put in another apartment,

126
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:34,657
but that's- that's really more of
a mental necessity than a physical one.

127
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,127
I have to get on the floor
sometimes to feel safe.

128
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,934
Sometimes I put heavy objects
on me when I feel anxious.

129
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,164
Gentlemen,
thank you for your time.

130
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,228
Cocksucker.

131
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,297
And, I want it ready
for a Christmas release.

132
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,037
I told you he would like it.

133
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,773
We're dealing with the best
in the business on this one.

134
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,642
You just have to move out.

135
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,014
I don't understand.

136
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,643
We're tryin'
to write a book here,

137
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,381
and things can get
pretty goddamn ugly.

138
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,253
Me, I like to- I like
to roam around a place,

139
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,292
like middle-of-the-night
type of thing.

140
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,885
Naked, even. But I don't
wanna feel self-conscious.

141
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,760
It could get real small
in here pretty fast.

142
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,856
Great.

143
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,092
Christmas...
that's 15 weeks away.

144
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,298
You guys fucking
rehearse this shit?

145
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,772
Hi, baby.

146
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,777
Ugh! Will you take the
fucking books off and stand up?

147
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,141
I guess I could, but...

148
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:34,016
um, I think I'd
sort a feel kind of unsafe.

149
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,917
You're fucked.

150
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,619
Fuck you too, Rudy.

151
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:16,224
Sorry, man.
I'm feeling... just not...

152
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,126
I understand.

153
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,874
I think I have
bad chemicals in my head.

154
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,137
Oh, don't go
blaming your brain again.

155
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,200
It's not his fault.

156
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,806
You think it is,
and your brain believes you.

157
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,520
They only eat bread.

158
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,577
Nonsense.

159
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,453
Genoa salami,
it's the best in the world-

160
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,618
they would've
invented it if they could've.

161
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,056
That shit's gonna kill you.

162
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,793
Yeah, well,
tell me when I'm dead.

163
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,761
Will do.

164
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,632
Who's this?

165
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,272
Uh... red suit, fat ass,
best friends are reindeer.

166
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,316
Bones Mrs. Claus.

167
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,715
And what's happening here?

168
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:16,744
Uh... Santa's sleigh
runs over Marty's tail,

169
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:20,883
Marty jumps up, bites him
in the crotch, gives him the clap.

170
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,499
Hey, you all right?

171
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,303
Yeah. This headache.

172
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,414
Let's get this book done.
No more jokes.

173
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,383
Yeah, sure, sure.

174
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,559
This is the final appearance
for Henry Roth and Rudy Holt,

175
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,228
best-selling authors
of the must-have children's book,

176
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,292
Marty the Beaver.

177
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,397
Be sure and get your
Christmas copy signed today.

178
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,501
I can't tell you how much
she just loved your book.

179
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,635
Oh, great.

180
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,579
Her name's Cassidy.

181
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,573
Have a nice life.

182
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,677
She's only been
with us for six months.

183
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,381
She's adopted.

184
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,289
So, how are ya, sweetheart?

185
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,989
I see you're a Knicks fan.

186
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,657
Yeah, you wanna buy her a drink,
take her somewhere quiet?

187
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,732
You ever been
to a basketball game?

188
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,672
You see, 'cause
Marty the Beaver was just here,

189
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,802
and he told me
to give someone called, uh-

190
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,642
Cassidy-
some Knicks tickets.

191
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,807
He must have meant you.

192
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,510
Hey, dick,
one of those was mine.

193
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,849
Don't be a piece of shit.

194
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,249
There we go.

195
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,929
Are these really from-
from Marty the Beaver?

196
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,299
Absolutely, yes.

197
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,943
If Marty the Beaver really existed,

198
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,275
and if he really had tickets

199
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,441
to the Knicks-Pacers game
on Friday night,

200
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,009
the only way he'd give 'em up is
if he was too high to get to the game,

201
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,579
or his fat, lazy beaver ass
couldn't fit in the seat.

202
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,426
Santa Claus doesn't exist.

203
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,232
Beaver can also mean vagina.

204
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,496
- Oh!
- Okay!

205
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,800
Cassidy!
Uh- uh- enjoy the game.

206
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,340
Come here.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

207
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,138
You just- you just
can't let your crap childhood

208
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,941
be a pass to shit on everyone else.

209
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,677
Well, every other kid is gonna be crushed
when they find out there's no Santa Claus.

210
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,150
She's now way ahead of the game,

211
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,383
and as a bonus she now
has another word for her pee-pee.

212
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,578
Hello?

213
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,361
It... looks great, man.

214
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,565
Well, it keeps me occupied.

215
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,834
Hey, you know, I've been
talking to Planck about it...

216
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,810
the book's on, uh, pre-order
for about 100,000 copies.

217
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,903
Oh, that's great.

218
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,379
Yeah, it is. It's great.

219
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,371
I, uh...

220
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,113
I, uh... I can't see
outta my left eye.

221
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,016
Well, it's the treatment.

222
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,970
Huh. I keep thinkin'
about things, you know?.

223
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,568
How... I was thinking...

224
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,810
if I close my good eye...

225
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,511
I see this- this bright light.

226
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:47,085
And, uh, I- I know
how it sounds, but it...

227
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,590
it's actually very beautiful.

228
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,133
I, uh...

229
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,763
I feel a little- a little sick.

230
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,035
Could you just lower
the bed a little bit, please?

231
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,666
Oh, yeah. Sure.

232
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,247
Yeah, that's good.

233
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,065
You know, Henry...

234
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,796
I wouldn't trade places
with you for anything.

235
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,436
I don't wanna leave
knowing that my only legacy

236
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,945
is a miserable piece of shit like you.

237
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,644
Hey, come- come on.
It's all right, don't- I understand.

238
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,811
I'm completely lucid, asshole.

239
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,720
Maybe I...

240
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,019
maybe I should've
had some fuckin' kids.

241
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,989
I'd have been better than your mom.

242
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,664
It's shitty what she did to you.
You need to know that.

243
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,223
You want a pillow or somethin'?

244
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,566
Finish the damn book,
find yourself a nice girl.

245
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,572
- A girl?
- Yeah.

246
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,631
Not a girl, a nice girl.

247
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,608
That's- that's even worse.

248
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,167
Yeah, for her.

249
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,908
And don't sigh
that stupid sigh of yours

250
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,074
and say, "Life,
you know what life is. "

251
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,141
Just stop doing that.

252
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,710
Don't do it, then, okay?

253
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,189
Yeah, well, you know,
you got a tumor in your head

254
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:30,126
that's taking up more real estate
than your brain, so...

255
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,666
It's a joke.

256
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,069
Yeah, I know.

257
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,003
You'll be fine.

258
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,615
I know.

259
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,165
Henry.

260
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,236
Oh, God.

261
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,511
I'm not crying.

262
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,081
Not in front of you.

263
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,095
You were saying?

264
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:15,259
I think it might be time

265
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:19,828
to think about jumping back in.

266
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,637
Finding another illustrator.

267
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,142
Rudy wasn't just another illustrator.

268
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,177
Henry, we have to publish in a month.

269
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,152
It's a contractual...

270
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,484
It's an upstairs thing,

271
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,387
those bastards upstairs in Legal.

272
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,360
You know,
I had a huge fight with them.

273
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,728
Henry, you know I have
a house at the beach in Sag Harbor.

274
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,824
Don't be an asshole.

275
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,665
And you just stay there
as long as you like,

276
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,934
and relax, and make it a part
of your grieving.

277
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:55,996
Henry?

278
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,978
Shit.

279
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,222
Keep working at it.

280
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,422
Hello.

281
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,930
Morning, Mr. Planck.

282
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,467
American kids
can recognize this face

283
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,836
before the President's.

284
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:33,708
You know, our illustrator Rudy Holt
has passed away.

285
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,373
It's so awful. The children
will miss him the most.

286
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,506
Uh, wrong.

287
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,984
Shareholders will miss him the most,
then me, then the children.

288
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,544
- That's true.
- Can we see, please?

289
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,989
Thank you.

290
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,462
All right, not very good.

291
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,793
That one's really awful.

292
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,799
Really bad.

293
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,870
All right, hmm.

294
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,905
Oh, crap.

295
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,835
Ooh, I'm sorry,
I'm thinking out loud.

296
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:23,392
Gentlemen, success in this business
is 99% perseverance

297
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,555
and 1 % talent.

298
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,622
Congratulations. You're 99% there.

299
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,936
Yeah, I'm not really good with math.

300
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,598
- He wants us to go.
- Okay.

301
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,341
I can rescue
a company from bankruptcy...

302
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,341
I can quote Chaucer and Proust,

303
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,580
and I can make
a terrific goose reduction.

304
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,850
Ask me to draw a frog.

305
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,119
You see, Miss Riley,
there are things that you can do

306
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,286
that I can't do, and vice versa.

307
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,024
This is Henry Roth's telephone number.

308
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,460
I'm sorry, Mr. Planck...

309
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,795
what's...?

310
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,102
- What's that?
- Yeah.

311
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,336
Uh... that's a frog.

312
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,168
You see?

313
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,509
They only eat bread.

314
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,881
Nonsense.

315
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,977
Genoa salami,
it's the best in the world-

316
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,646
they would've invented it
if they could've.

317
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,021
That shit's gonna kill you.

318
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,391
Yeah, well, tell it to me
when I'm dead.

319
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,128
I am.

320
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,791
What?

321
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:13,166
I'm telling it to you
when you're dead.

322
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:16,639
No, that's not what happened.

323
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,233
I said, "Tell it to me when I'm dead,"

324
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,642
and you said, "Will do,"

325
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,407
then you offered me a cigarette.

326
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,312
I'm improvising, okay?
Roll with it.

327
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,509
All right.

328
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,714
Planck wants me
to right another book.

329
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,815
- Good.
- I'm not gonna do it.

330
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,383
Got no choice, pal, my dying wish.

331
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,326
When you said that
you were thinking with a tumor.

332
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,194
Screw you.

333
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,135
Fifteen fuckin' years
I put up with your nasty bullshit.

334
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,364
Fuck it.

335
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,071
You think people wanna die?

336
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,010
I had a great time being alive.

337
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,547
I fucking loved it.

338
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,982
I loved women.

339
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,020
I told a hooker once that I loved her,

340
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,816
and goddamn it, I meant it.

341
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,516
And I loved you,

342
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,423
but most of all, even more than you,

343
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,654
I loved being alive.

344
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,932
Now, you better find someone
to be happy with, Henry,

345
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,526
'cause if you keep
hanging around with you,

346
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,537
you're gonna wanna kill yourself.

347
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,735
I wouldn't blame you!

348
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,945
Fuck you, motherfucker!

349
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,382
Asshole piece of shit!

350
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,680
Fuck you!

351
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,690
Out!

352
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,465
Jesus, God,
don't burst in on me like that.

353
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,869
You are in arrears.

354
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,238
You are no longer living
in accordance with the lease.

355
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,300
- You are breaking the law, Mother.
- Out!

356
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,779
A law, excuse me,
that clearly indicates that a landlord-

357
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,179
I'm your mother!

358
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:08,345
A landlord may not break
the threshold of her property

359
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,820
unless it's with a writ of consent
from a tenant,

360
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,117
accompanied by law enforcement

361
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,887
or an official from
the Department of Housing!

362
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,725
Oh, God.

363
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,199
Oh, my God.

364
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,331
Are you gay?

365
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,933
No, Mom.

366
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,568
If you are, just tell me.

367
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:36,409
You know, I-
I just found a dildo.

368
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,073
It's a vibrator, Mom.

369
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:43,919
I'm still trying to figure out
why was the poor thing frozen?

370
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,650
It wasn't frozen, it was hidden.

371
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,282
Don't avoid the gay question.

372
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,260
Okay, tea.
Do you want some tea?

373
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,753
Yeah.

374
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,299
Why haven't you called him?

375
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,426
He looked at my sketchbook

376
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,335
and told me to keep working at it.

377
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,339
Well, have you kept working at it?

378
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,272
Yeah, of course.

379
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,708
A lot. Look.

380
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,538
Oh, that's awful, honey.

381
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,708
I hate cartoons.
They're absolutely sinister.

382
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,944
Please.

383
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,452
I can't stand them.

384
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,283
Thank you, Mom.

385
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,852
I'm so sorry, dear.

386
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:24,987
It's okay.

387
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,394
I'm sorry, it's just...

388
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,525
Here, let me give you some money.

389
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,795
No, no, no, no, no.

390
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,666
No, no, put your
checkbook away. Stop.

391
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,069
Please just forgive me
for what I just said.

392
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,869
All right? Will you do that?

393
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,409
- Will you forgive me?
- Yeah.

394
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,603
Thank you.

395
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,070
I don't know what I'm doing.

396
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,346
So, this is gonna take you
to the middle of the month,

397
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,910
and a little bit beyond it.

398
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,490
Thank you.

399
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,928
This is the last time,
though, honestly.

400
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,486
If this doesn't work out
and I can't pay rent next month,

401
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:03,967
then I'm gonna apply
to a few law schools.

402
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,667
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

403
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,699
I have to start shattering
this dream, not supporting it.

404
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,438
It is more practical.

405
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,947
I'm giving you until the 20th,

406
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,710
and them I'm gonna
send in the movers,

407
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,013
and I'm gonna change the lock.

408
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,510
Okay.

409
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,463
Hello?

410
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,871
Planck's a sociopath.

411
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,306
He's a cross-dresser.

412
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,207
He's a hermaphrodite.

413
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,178
The guy's a eunuch.

414
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:51,113
He's a vegetarian for health reasons,
not ethical ones.

415
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,548
You can't trust anything the guy says.

416
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:56,947
- There are less...
- Fuck!

417
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,889
...patronizing ways of saying
I'm not good enough to work with you.

418
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,153
I never said you weren't good enough.

419
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,752
Yeah, you did, actually.

420
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,959
You told me to keep working at it.

421
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,002
Oh, well, if I did say that,

422
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,730
I didn't mean with me.

423
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,900
I'm so sorry about your partner.

424
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,571
Was he a really good friend?

425
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:24,137
No, he was just
a dick who drew well.

426
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,015
I understand that people like Rudy
are irreplaceable,

427
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,748
because I've had people like that
in my own life,

428
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:34,189
but, Henry, honestly,

429
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,750
illustrating for me is just a job.

430
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,523
It doesn't have to be
anything more than that.

431
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm not looking for friends,
especially bad ones.

432
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,668
So...

433
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,144
Lucy, how'd you
get into the business?

434
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,570
Thank you.

435
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:00,974
So?

436
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:12,627
Um, I was going for my PhD
in English literature,

437
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:16,360
but I had this big breakup,
falling out with my thesis advisor-

438
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,958
boyfriend.

439
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,561
So then I went to art school
for a little bit,

440
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,075
and that was a long blah story,

441
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:28,704
and I ended up leaving
because I had to find a job.

442
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,714
So I picked children's books
because it was

443
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,012
the furthest thing from literature
I could think of.

444
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,075
Oh, I see. Interesting.

445
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,950
Hi, what can I get you guys?

446
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,717
Nothing, go ahead.

447
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:44,422
Um, I'll just have a Caesar salad
and a side of mashed potatoes.

448
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,690
Thanks.

449
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,467
Bulimia?

450
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,331
No, hungry.

451
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,928
You sure? That stuff comes
back up pretty easily.

452
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,998
Now that I'm in,

453
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,169
you're really gonna have
to try harder than that

454
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,213
to knock me off my game.

455
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,377
You see our waitress over there?

456
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,951
She wants to be an actress.

457
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,085
She's got that air of entitlement
mixed with desperation.

458
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,494
She doesn't have the looks, though.

459
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,031
She doesn't even have the talent,

460
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,533
but, like an old donkey,

461
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,761
she's been at it so long,

462
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,236
she's not fit to try to do
anything else.

463
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,968
She lies to her mom.

464
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,238
She's embarrassed to tell her
about losing the job

465
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,974
for the big Palmolive commercial,

466
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,675
but, fingers crossed,

467
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,413
she's got an audition
for Blockbuster Videos.

468
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,592
She had an abortion once.

469
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,528
She still cries about it sometimes,
even though she saved that thing

470
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:56,658
from an agonizing life
of eating leftover mashed potatoes

471
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:01,297
and watching its Mom lose jobs
like Palmolive commercials.

472
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,843
She's got about three ovarian eggs left.

473
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:14,379
In addition to being less interesting
and much less attractive...

474
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:20,354
you're so much more
pathetic than she is.

475
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,227
You're not in.

476
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,101
I hate Henry Roth.

477
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,406
I don't think it's possible
to work with him.

478
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,537
I think I'd be much happier
back downstairs.

479
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,479
That is so
unprofessional, Miss Riley.

480
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,880
I'm shocked.

481
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,117
You can call me by my first name.

482
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,654
Well, of course I can...

483
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,849
- Lisa.
- Lucy.

484
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,084
- Lizzie? Lucy.
- Lucy.

485
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,754
Lucy, Henry Roth is
the only reason you have a job.

486
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:02,562
$100,000 if you can get
a book out of him by Christmas.

487
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,626
I think someone else would be
much more appropriate for the job.

488
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,170
Wonderful.

489
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,672
So why don't you
clear out your things.

490
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:12,073
I'll be only too glad
to give you a reference.

491
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,473
Miss Riley?

492
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,141
Lucy?

493
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,277
A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

494
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,214
Two hundred.

495
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,454
That is my final offer,

496
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,859
and I would think very carefully
before walking out that door.

497
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,964
I am prostituting myself.

498
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,063
Your methods are your own.

499
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,168
What can you take me for?

500
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,267
I can fight it,
but it's gonna get expensive.

501
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,538
There's no guarantee.

502
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,807
- What's your name again?
- Jake.

503
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,475
Jake. What can Planck
take me for?

504
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,178
That depends on what they can
convince a judge a book's worth.

505
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,050
A million, maybe.
Maybe two million.

506
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,713
Shit.

507
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,900
Lucy, no!

508
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,837
Get the fuck out of here!

509
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,273
- Who is he?
- What is wrong with you?

510
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,243
Mom, I thought he was
gonna rob me, or rape me...

511
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,869
- ... or kill me or something!
- Gather yourself.

512
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,107
This is business.
Don't get hysterical.

513
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,618
- But I live there!
- And I can't keep floating you.

514
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,284
Yours is the only apartment
in this entire building

515
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,086
that's still paying last year's rent.

516
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,558
Okay, I moved in four months ago.

517
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:41,622
A four-month ride that has
to come to an end sometime.

518
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,065
I have to push you from the nest.

519
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,399
Oh, Mom, you are so insane.

520
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,166
Okay, okay, no more tears.
No more tears.

521
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,969
Okay, now, I would be happy
to show you

522
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,976
an apartment on First and A.

523
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,946
It is a walk-up, but it's half
of whatever they're charging you here.

524
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,506
What you are charging me, Mom!

525
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,677
Don't get personal!

526
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,351
Oh, shit.

527
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,986
You could've called.

528
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,323
I'm... I'm sorry I didn't call.

529
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,193
You know, it's just...

530
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:19,600
agonizing when you get these
"We just moved to NewYork" people.

531
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,696
Hey, it's Lucy. Leave me a message.

532
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,604
Lucy, it's Jeremy.

533
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,666
Um, I'm in New York,

534
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,507
and... I'm in your neighborhood.

535
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,839
And it's been a year, it would seem,
which is hard to believe.

536
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,509
Um...

537
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,987
Lucy, look, I've been...

538
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,787
thinking about things, and I'm...

539
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,225
sort of wondering if you've
been thinking about things too.

540
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,786
I mean, I would
completely understand

541
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,298
if you never want to see me again,
of course I would, but...

542
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,767
I was hoping that we could
maybe meet up.

543
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,465
So, I hope this finds you well.

544
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,099
Love to your mum.
Hello, Carol, if you're there.

545
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,237
Um, so, yeah,
call me when you can.

546
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,472
Okay, thanks. Bye.

547
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,077
No.

548
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,213
Oh, honey.

549
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,281
What men do
when they treat you like shit

550
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,328
is they feel bad.

551
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,159
Call it asshole's remorse.

552
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,220
You just watch.

553
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,598
He's gonna make
some meaningless act of contrition,

554
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,161
one which you should
really consider accepting.

555
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,805
What's this?

556
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,942
I remembered you liked flowers.

557
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,245
Spring bouquet.

558
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:02,672
Don't ask me why,
but I've always been partial to flowers.

559
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,674
You want to send me
a Valentine's gift,

560
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:08,109
you can take your box of chocolates
and stick it up your ass.

561
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,703
I like flowers.

562
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,415
Nice girl, huh?

563
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,510
I might work with her.

564
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,747
It's... uh...

565
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,352
I just wanted to apologize, to-

566
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,415
She's lovely.

567
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,687
Like an antelope in a junkyard.

568
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,601
I didn't...
I didn't notice.

569
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,596
Notice?

570
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,904
Give the flowers
to one of the neighbors.

571
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,228
Okay, we're declaring a truce.

572
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:02,062
Said truce shall be in effect
for exactly three weeks and four days,

573
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,398
at the end of which time
you will deliver to me a completed book,

574
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,734
the topic of which
will be a Christmas story

575
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,204
featuring Marty the Beaver.

576
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,071
This will avert legal action
against Mr. Henry Roth,

577
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:15,237
and entitle Ms. Lucy Riley
to a bonus of-

578
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,544
Of $5,000.

579
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,345
Uh, wow, you really hit
the big time there, Lucy.

580
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,547
I'll be checking in on your progress.

581
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,613
What if we don't make any?

582
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,285
I may be forced to hire
another collaborator.

583
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,565
Cancel
all shrink appointments, haircuts,

584
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,259
highlightings, frostings.

585
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,926
Tell your boyfriend you're a dyke.

586
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,994
If you've got any pets, put 'em to sleep,
'cause the next three weeks we work.

587
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:44,604
I don't have a boyfriend.

588
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,302
Don't complain to me about it.

589
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,811
Hey!

590
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:56,849
Hey!

591
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,881
Can we just go ahead and get
the apology out of the way now?.

592
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,859
Yeah, I don't really do great at those.

593
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,419
You were awful to someone you don't
even know, to say nothing of me.

594
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,930
I wanna go to the bathroom.

595
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,762
Would you sit down
under the table like this

596
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,823
and shut the fuck up.

597
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,733
Okay, you're right, I admit it.

598
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,729
- What?
- I was awful, I apologize.

599
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,740
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not how it works.

600
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,106
You can't apologize yet.
I'm just getting started.

601
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,805
Oh, Jesus.

602
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,870
Okay, hey, you know,
whatever you want.

603
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,815
Look, I was wrong,
you're right, you know?.

604
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:27,873
Who cares?

605
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,387
I have to go to the bathroom!

606
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,814
Are you crying?
Sit down.

607
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,258
You like that?
You want that to happen again?

608
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,559
Stop it. Are you a little girl,
or are you a little boy?

609
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,098
Just answer me that question.

610
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,192
Don't you...
Shut up. Shut up.

611
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,635
I guess I shouldn't expect
anything from you.

612
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,004
Suck those tears in.
Suck them in right now.

613
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,942
I don't know why,
but I am in a breakfasty kind of mood.

614
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,241
You just went to the bathroom.

615
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,975
I wanna go to the bathroom!
- Eggs.

616
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,641
Over easy.

617
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,150
Oh, Jesus, I...

618
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,587
If you go over there,
she's just gonna take that kid home

619
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,452
and beat the shit out of him
because of you.

620
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,513
You want that?

621
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,525
Hey, I didn't think of it that way.

622
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,573
You wanna go somewhere else?

623
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,234
No, I'm okay.

624
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,301
I do.

625
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,159
Get off.

626
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,767
Lacks a certain, um...

627
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,636
woman's touch.

628
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,408
There's no woman's touch here.

629
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,881
The ones that did touch
did so at their own peril.

630
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,347
Okay, uh, before we can, uh...

631
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,385
work effectively with one another,
I think we should be comfortable.

632
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,951
So, 10 minutes, okay?
Then- then work.

633
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,292
Okay? Go.

634
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,467
Okay, I'll start.

635
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,937
Uh, I hate my mother.
I hate my goddamn dead father more.

636
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,337
Rudy was the only friend I ever had.

637
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,309
I had a girlfriend once who I used to like
to masturbate to more than have sex with.

638
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,902
Carrots and snakes frighten me.

639
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,242
Um...

640
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,146
I'm superstitious about the number...

641
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,142
I can only stir things counterclockwise,

642
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,211
and I know that if I don't
something bad will happen.

643
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,154
I take size 111/2 shoe.

644
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,858
I don't have a favorite book.

645
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,653
Oh...

646
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,096
What's crucial?

647
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,865
Oh, I don't drive or ride in cars.

648
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:02,928
Statistically speaking,

649
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,941
you have a 100% chance
of being in an accident in your lifetime.

650
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,169
They're death boxes.

651
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,769
I give to Amnesty international
on the off chance

652
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,645
I'm ever imprisoned and tortured
for my political beliefs.

653
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,744
Paradoxically,
I have no political beliefs.

654
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,220
Life is pain. Black kids
are cuter than white ones.

655
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,780
What's important?

656
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,289
I didn't mean it when
I compared you to our waitress.

657
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,729
I was only trying to hurt you.

658
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,392
I could've been
meaner about your looks,

659
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,402
and what I would have said
would have made you cry.

660
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,109
I have a towel I can't throw out
'cause it may have feelings.

661
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,014
When I ejaculate,
I go into deep depressions.

662
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,684
Though by any standard
you're a nice person,

663
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,350
I deeply resent
having to work with you.

664
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,795
I love...

665
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,027
Japanese monster movies.

666
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,160
Gamera, specifically.

667
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,774
Gamera movies?

668
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,709
¶ Gamera ¶

669
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,018
¶ Gamera ¶

670
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,522
Attention, everyone, take cover!
Gamera is attacking!

671
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,589
An earthquake!

672
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,636
No, not an earthquake.
Gamera!

673
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:42,103
- He's coming, I tell you.
- We're not going anywhere!

674
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:45,836
I say we should stay here and dance!
How about it?

675
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,172
¶ Gamera ¶

676
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,804
Are you sure you had
a girlfriend once?

677
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,645
Are you all insane?
Hurry, get out of here!

678
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,707
¶ Gamera ¶

679
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,014
¶ Gamera ¶

680
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:02,457
So I have an ex-boyfriend,
ex-thesis advisor, Jeremy.

681
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,727
And we lived together for,
like, three years.

682
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,856
Anyway, he took a sabbatical...

683
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,697
...from his professorsh-

684
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,097
You loved him, he left you,
you're never gonna get over him...

685
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,969
You thought he was complicated
because he once got a blow job

686
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,478
from a boy at boarding school.

687
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,946
Sex with you was tired,
and now he's having a blast

688
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,448
balling every woman in academia.

689
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,950
It's the gripe coming out of you

690
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,077
and almost every other woman
in the world.

691
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,555
One guy is not gonna take advantage.

692
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,888
Wow, I had no idea how prevalent
blow jobs were in boys' schools.

693
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,092
- Who are you calling?
- Arthur Planck's office, please.

694
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:43,722
Henry?

695
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,395
Your bonus sickens me.
It's a fucking disgrace.

696
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,233
Oh, no, no.

697
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,000
No, don't do that.
Don't do that.

698
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,336
I'm okay.

699
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,244
I'm gonna give you
some money myself.

700
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,739
Rudy and I weren't in it
for the money, either.

701
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,151
Just the chicks.

702
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,556
Message one.

703
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,361
Hi, it's Jeremy.
Are you free tomorrow morning?

704
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:53,596
No.

705
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,003
Let me know. Okay.
Give us a call. Bye.

706
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,735
End of messages.

707
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,146
I finished my book.
It's coming out this Christmas.

708
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,347
Romanticism from Conception
to Misconception.

709
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,251
My editors think it's gonna be
this year's gift

710
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:14,291
for the big intellectual
snob in your life.

711
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,020
It's like, What To Get
for the Man Who Knows Everything.

712
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,627
I'm very happy for you.

713
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,659
An enormous advance.

714
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:26,658
Fuck.

715
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,672
And I've... well,
I thought what I should do-

716
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,506
What I wanted to do, was...

717
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:38,514
To use it to start a life with someone,
and, as you know, I'm very picky,

718
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,550
so I thought, who better
to start a life with-

719
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,449
- Lucky girl.
- Yeah.

720
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,854
I wanted to show you
a copy of the book,

721
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,790
a galley, but they're still
revising things on it.

722
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,731
Do you know what the dedication is?

723
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,426
No.

724
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,196
I know you don't, but guess.

725
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,429
I don't know.

726
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,640
Well, it's to you. It says, "To Lucy.

727
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:08,269
My muse, my inspiration,
my window into beauty. "

728
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,878
Wow.

729
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,053
I find it really funny that you had
to run away from this muse

730
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,420
to write the thing.

731
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,558
Were you with someone?

732
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,436
Fuck.

733
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,339
Yes, I was.

734
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,570
There was a girl.

735
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,169
Her name was Simone.
It lasted a few months.

736
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,681
- And I'm really fucking sorry.
- Okay, enough.

737
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,014
Lucy, if you ask me a question,
I'm going to answer it,

738
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,421
and I'm going to answer it honestly.

739
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,221
I tell you, ask me if I love you.
Why don't you ask me that?

740
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,058
Are you an asshole?

741
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,860
Now that- yeah.
I don't answer rhetorical ones.

742
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,703
What are you doing Friday night?

743
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,139
Working.

744
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,904
Sounds dull.

745
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,471
What about The Marriage of Figaro
at the Met?

746
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,520
I don't know.
Call me on Friday afternoon.

747
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,216
They're 200 a pop.

748
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,624
Would you mind giving me a bit more
indication now if you're interested?

749
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,855
Why? Does Simone want to go?

750
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,932
Just let me think about it, okay?

751
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,096
I will. Thank you.

752
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,298
Okay, thanks.

753
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,362
Hey...

754
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,344
Thank you for the coffee.

755
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,404
Yeah, it's okay.

756
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,061
You go anywhere special for inspiration?

757
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,288
Yeah.

758
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:13,928
Yeah, um, Jeremy and I
used to rent a house on the shore.

759
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,631
Oh, God, no,
not that kind of inspiration.

760
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:18,174
I'm talking about, like, a whorehouse
in Chinatown or a titty bar-

761
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,369
you know, somewhere
to connect you to reality.

762
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,538
God, it was so beautiful,
the ocean at night.

763
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,276
The sky was filled with a million stars.

764
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:31,577
I love the sound of the ocean,
the way it seemed to breathe and...

765
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,648
And spend a few hours
looking for a shooting star and...

766
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,221
then make some corny wish on one.

767
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,958
Okay, I'm gonna make a wish now.

768
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:43,522
I wish you'd stop talking.

769
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:47,902
We've got work to do,
and I ask you if anything inspires you,

770
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,496
and you start going on about you
and your dopey boyfriend at the beach?

771
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,303
You know what?
You don't always have to say

772
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,503
the first smart-ass thing
that pops in your head, Henry.

773
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,547
I know this probably means
nothing to you, but it's really unattractive.

774
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:00,947
It just makes you look weak
and fearful, not clever.

775
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,747
So fuckin' knock it off.

776
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:33,239
¶ We sailed away on a winter's day ¶

777
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:38,277
¶ With fate as malleable as clay ¶

778
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:43,019
¶ But ships are fallible, I say ¶

779
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:48,156
¶ And the nautical,
like all things, fades ¶

780
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:52,601
¶ And, oh, my love ¶

781
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:55,866
¶ Oh, it was a funny little thing ¶

782
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,304
Thank you.

783
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,705
No beach, though.

784
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,541
I didn't even expect stars.

785
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,103
Any great ideas for the book?

786
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,807
It must not work without the beach.

787
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:08,874
Mmm.

788
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:13,286
¶ The sight of bridges and balloons ¶

789
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:17,851
¶ Makes calm canaries irritable ¶

790
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:23,195
¶ And they caw and claw all afternoon ¶

791
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:29,069
¶ Canaries and dirigibles ¶

792
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,404
¶ Oh, my love ¶

793
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:36,139
¶ Oh, it was a funny little thing ¶

794
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,912
¶ To be... ¶

795
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,248
My brother used to have one of these.

796
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,185
Oh, nice.

797
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,247
He never, ever let me look through it.

798
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,816
Unless my mother was there,
then he'd have to, but...

799
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,557
it killed him.

800
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,066
He kind of thought the whole universe
was his personal property.

801
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,494
I think most men share that view.

802
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,937
I got binoculars.

803
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,872
Do you look at stars?

804
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,345
People's rooms.

805
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,938
Rudy and I used to go up on the roof.

806
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:14,506
He sounds like quite the father figure.

807
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,575
Rudy was nothing like my father.

808
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,616
My father ran off
with his secretary.

809
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,992
Wha- um, back up.

810
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:37,132
Um, he- he-
he ran off with his secretary?

811
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,072
Ah, it was the '70s.

812
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,167
That's- that's so cliche.

813
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:44,145
At least mine had the decency to die.

814
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,376
You still talk to him?

815
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,419
No, not much to say.

816
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:53,855
I could think of a couple of things.

817
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:58,327
Yeah, I know you could. Thank you.

818
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,765
Hey, sorry I said some shitty stuff
about you before.

819
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,328
It just- you know.

820
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:16,902
Seriously.

821
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:19,913
Sorry.

822
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,253
Okay.

823
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,634
I couldn't wait till Friday.

824
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:41,728
I mean, this can't be it.

825
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,069
Can it really? Really?

826
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,200
I refuse to believe that.

827
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,738
When I wrote that you were
a window into beauty,

828
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,476
I truly meant it.

829
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,584
Because you are,
you're my only window.

830
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:04,958
I'll see you Friday.

831
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:10,060
¶ Big monster lover¶

832
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,432
¶ A bigger pusher-over¶

833
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,043
¶ Stands apart
through most walks of life ¶

834
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:27,309
¶ Walks alone
in most walks of life ¶

835
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,695
Let's not get in the habit
of sleeping here.

836
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,893
Hey, Henry.

837
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:46,527
Henry, wake up,
or they'll throw you out.

838
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,400
Uh, 41. Play 41.

839
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:56,345
And, uh, 22 and 50 and 8.

840
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,610
Why are we here?
We never win.

841
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,550
You never win,
because you never play.

842
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,610
All you do is play,
and all you do is lose.

843
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:05,814
It's pathetic.

844
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,756
Well, look,
I don't play for the money.

845
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:11,259
I play for the joy it gives me.

846
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,796
The pleasure I have, the thrill.

847
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,425
The thrill?

848
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,766
- You're a pussy.
- Guess so.

849
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,600
- Loser.
- Born that way.

850
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,530
She's a nice girl.

851
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,545
She deserves better than him.

852
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,517
Now you're talkin'.

853
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:36,677
Better than me too.

854
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,948
Yeah, probably,
but she doesn't know that yet.

855
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,252
I'm starting to like her.

856
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:46,718
Well, show her you at your best.

857
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:54,399
I can't.
I don't have a best.

858
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:57,304
My best is at best...

859
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,104
depressing.

860
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,747
Thanks for coming.

861
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,646
Anything for you, pal.

862
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,582
Oh, don't kiss my ass.
It makes me feel weird.

863
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,552
Yeah, me too.

864
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,954
So why am I here?

865
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:53,018
Lucy can't work in the city.
Too many distractions.

866
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,859
Mmm. You, perhaps.

867
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,899
Can I still use the house at the beach?

868
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,290
Yeah.

869
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,360
Yeah, and the car?

870
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,406
What, do you drive
all of a sudden now?.

871
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,633
Yeah.

872
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,177
All right.

873
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,238
It's in the Fourth Street garage.

874
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:15,910
And I want you to keep me
apprised of your progress.

875
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:20,647
Every single day.

876
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,784
He's an academic.
You know, British. Total egghead.

877
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,122
Brilliant, though.

878
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,184
How brilliant?

879
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,527
I have him if you want me
to fix you up with him.

880
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,566
That's okay. Anything else?

881
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:32,499
What do you want to know?.

882
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,436
Just, you know, any hobbies,
any weaknesses.

883
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:37,200
You know, junk like that.

884
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,366
Uh...

885
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:43,411
It's been the lunchroom talk
around here.

886
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,380
Here, take a gander.
Here he is.

887
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,786
Jeremy Cots wold Sturges.

888
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,018
Open it up.

889
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:03,956
Romantic, right?

890
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,626
Flip the page.

891
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,240
He's got two girls.

892
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,040
Can't decide
who he wants to dedicate it to.

893
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:17,875
He's gonna wait
for the thing to go to press.

894
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:19,574
Tool.

895
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,483
Anyway I can keep this?

896
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,325
Why are we doing this?

897
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,166
Jesus! Why are you doing that?
Oh, my God!

898
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,138
You know, I'm gonna be here
when we get there.

899
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,196
We can talk then.

900
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,867
Well, just tell me
why you're doing this then?

901
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,604
So you can have the beach
and the stars,

902
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,077
and we can write our fuckin' book.

903
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,477
That's- it's okay.

904
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:52,947
I think it's sweet.

905
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,126
Come on.

906
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,095
Bet he'd have liked you.

907
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,809
Old Jewish custom,
it's a symbol of affection.

908
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,117
Here you go, from both of us.

909

But I thought you only had a problem
stirring things clockwise.

925
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:33,068
It's long metal things going clockwise.

926
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,635
It's okay.

927
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,238
¶ You may not realize ¶

928
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:40,782

¶ Ooh, it may be the best thing ¶

933
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,863
This'll do.

934
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,101
Weird.

935
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,056
Hey, you still have
that stone I gave you?

936
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,114
Yeah.

937
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,092
Oh, man. Good.

938
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,288
This one looks just like it.

939
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:30,621
No.

940
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,601
'Cause, see, mine has two
little blue specks right there.

941
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,662
Kinda look like eyes.

942
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,407
Like, there's a little guy inside,

943
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,602
and he has his face pressed up
against the inside,

944
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:42,667
trying to look out.

945
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,734
See?

946
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:46,804
How'd he get in there?

947
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:51,086
There's not really
a guy inside there.

948
00:59:58,661 --> 00:59:59,650
What?

949
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,591
Hey! No, no, no!

950
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:13,464
You're a jerk.

951
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:16,512
This is my stone.

952
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:18,547
This is my stone!

953
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,985
Hey, got anything for me to draw yet?

954
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,217
No.

955
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:07,326
So, what if Marty gets
some lame Christmas gift,

956
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,557
something...

957
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:11,923
stupid, like, um...

958
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,932
your shirt.

959
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:16,994
And...

960
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,768
My ex-girlfriend gave me this shirt.

961
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,343
So, anyway, he's at
the department store the next day

962
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:23,401
trying to return the thing...

963
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:24,741
Her fashion sense was
the best thing about her.

964
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:27,282
...when he bumps into her
at the cash register.

965
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,340
- Who?
- Marty.

966
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:30,750
Bumps into who?

967
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,878
Whom? Whom?

968
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:32,978
His girlfriend.

969
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:34,853
Marty doesn't have a girlfriend.

970
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:37,214
Why not?

971
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,783
He doesn't want one.

972
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,624
Oh.

973
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,799
It's a big step.
He'd probably ruin her.

974
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,267
Yeah, you're right.

975
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:50,464
She'd want commitment,
and sweetness,

976
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,270
and to be treated like she's the only
beaver in the whole wide world,

977
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,902
and Marty's not ready for that.

978
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:00,612
Let me think about it.

979
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,940
¶ Right, wrong, what to do ¶

980
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:31,241
¶ Someday it will come to you ¶

981
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:37,675
¶ Hot style in the end ¶

982
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:42,589
¶ We named a summer camp for you ¶

983
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:51,090
¶ I've got nothing to say ¶

984
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:55,626
¶ I've got nothing to say ¶

985
01:02:56,005 --> 01:03:03,972
¶ I've got nothing to say ¶

986
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:07,614
¶ We could drag you down ¶

987
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:11,949
¶ But that's for other bands to do ¶

988
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:22,020
¶ I've got nothing to give ¶

989
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:25,431
¶ Got no reason to live ¶

990
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,833
¶ And I will fight to survive ¶

991
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,235
¶ I've got nothing to hide ¶

992
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:33,264
¶ Wish I wasn't so shy ¶

993
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:39,640
I can't sleep.

994
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:43,048
Must be the, uh-
must be the time difference.

995
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,510
What's that?

996
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,685
This is something
I tossed in the car.

997
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:54,060
And gift-wrapped?

998
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,961
Gift-wrapped
and tossed in the car.

999
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:57,693
Oh, my gosh.

1000
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:06,240
Oh, my gosh.

1001
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,905
You can go ahead and open it.

1002
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:12,937
Okay.

1003
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,752
Oh, my God!

1004
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:28,491
Wanna go take a look?

1005
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,603
What are you looking for?

1006
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:38,265
Something dim and fuzzy

1007
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:41,606
and almost impossible to locate.

1008
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,001
Nebula?

1009
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,108
I been readin' up.

1010
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,107
Wow.

1011
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:52,950
Clouds of gas.
Stars are born in 'em.

1012
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,354
Trip to the planetarium
made me feel like an idiot.

1013
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:01,625
Sometimes the gas is a- is a-

1014
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:04,188
a remnant of a supernova.

1015
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:05,256
Mm-hmm.

1016
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:09,464
Which is a star which dies
in a particularly spectacular...

1017
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,236
violent fashion.

1018
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:14,968
Wow.

1019
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:21,245
Okay.

1020
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,285
Okay, look right here.

1021
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:24,341
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1022
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:27,884
Okay, where?

1023
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:32,587
Oh, you have to sort of
move your eye around to find it.

1024
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,392
Okay, um...

1025
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:39,764
Mmm. I don't see anything.

1026
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:41,166
Mmm. Hold on.

1027
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,833
Yeah, here it is.

1028
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:47,775
It is...

1029
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:51,836
it's, like, right above
the big blue star.

1030
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:53,074
You'll see.

1031
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:56,608
I don't see it!

1032
01:05:58,087 --> 01:05:59,748
Okay, hold on, let me see.

1033
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,551
Oh.

1034
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,955
It's there.

1035
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,953
Try again.
Do you see anything?

1036
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,627
No!

1037
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,625
Really?

1038
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,134
Oh, fuck! Big blue star!

1039
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,573
Okay, anything else?

1040
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,974
Uh...

1041
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:24,535
Get out...
A bunch of dim ones.

1042
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:25,875
Okay, now look up.

1043
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:35,788
¶ Aaahhh ¶

1044
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:47,666
¶ Aaahhh ¶

1045
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,773
I can't.

1046
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:00,838
Yes, you can.

1047
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,384
We have to work.

1048
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:04,510
Right now?.

1049
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:07,881
Lucy, come on, please.
It's gonna get...

1050
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,391
very complicated.

1051
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:13,724
Aaahhh, God, it's gonna get
so complicated.

1052
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:16,663
Do you just genuinely
dislike me, Henry?

1053
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,626
A week ago I didn't give
a rat's ass about nebulas,

1054
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:23,695
and now I can't get
enough of them, 'kay?

1055
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:28,742
Nebulae.

1056
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:30,734
What?

1057
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:34,249
It's- it's "nebulae,"
not "nebulas. "

1058
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,409
Okay, fine.
I don't care about nebulas.

1059
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:38,749
You accuse me of whatever you want.
I'm probably guilty of it:

1060
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,016
contributing to global warming
and killing a squirrel once

1061
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:42,421
and using the word "retarded"

1062
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:43,981
and occasionally
misinterpreted bigotry,

1063
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,459
but don't- don't- don't-

1064
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:47,257
don't- don't- don't-
don't- don't-

1065
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:49,661
accusing me of not liking you.

1066
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,156
'Kay?

1067
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:56,664
I understand.

1068
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:27,394
¶ Losing the star without a sky ¶

1069
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:35,338
¶ Losing the reasons why ¶

1070
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:43,808
¶ Losing the call
that you've been faking ¶

1071
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:48,483
¶ And I'm not kidding ¶

1072
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:59,700
¶ It's damned if you don't,
it's damned if you do ¶

1073
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:03,427
¶ Be true ¶

1074
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:08,409
¶ 'Cause I'll lock you up
in a sad, sad tune ¶

1075
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:14,044
¶ Men are hard ¶

1076
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:18,212
¶ You're not worth a thing ¶

1077
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:21,980
¶ Men are hard ¶

1078
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:26,517
¶ You're not hiding ¶

1079
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,205
So, maybe, um...

1080
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:43,245
Marty does have a girlfriend
after all.

1081
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:44,904
No.

1082
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,471
Well, you know, he's got
to start thinking about the future.

1083
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,748
You mean little beavers?

1084
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:54,145
No. My God!

1085
01:09:56,992 --> 01:10:00,018
Jesus! Let's not get crazy, okay?
Can you imagine?

1086
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,521
He's still not a very trusting beaver.

1087
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:05,089
- You know?.
- Mm-hmm.

1088
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:06,600
Yeah.

1089
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,830
Give him some time to get used
to having a girlfriend first.

1090
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,963
Okay, okay, okay.

1091
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:18,170
And I'm not gonna stop you
from drawing a little beaver.

1092
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,681
I just can't guarantee
it's gonna be in the book.

1093
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:25,686
- It's okay. I can wait.
- Okay.

1094
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:29,087
But I can't start drawing anything
until you start writing.

1095
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:32,820
Right. Okay.

1096
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:37,621
Give me a couple of hours.

1097
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,379
You're about to drive me
out of my gourd.

1098
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,948
Well, I'm sorry, Henry.

1099
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:05,994
You didn't keep me informed
of your progress.

1100
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:08,222
Well, we've been too busy working.

1101
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,663
Look, she'll finish it
with another collaborator.

1102
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:13,497
This is a done deal.
This is nonnegotiable at this point.

1103
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,003
- Uh-huh.
- Henry, I am not kidding.

1104
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:18,198
Now, I expect Lucy
back here in the morning

1105
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,764
to start working with a new writer.

1106
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,332
Well, what makes you think
she's gonna come back?

1107
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,140
Henry, don't apply any
undue pressure to the girl.

1108
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:27,478
Her bonus is contingent
upon delivering a completed book,

1109
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:28,709
with or without you.

1110
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:31,844
Arthur, she doesn't give a flying shit
about 5,000 bucks.

1111
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,289
Oh, Henry, Henry,
it is not $5,000.

1112
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:41,189
Hey, can I talk to you a second?

1113
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:50,068
Can I, uh, see the stone?

1114
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,128
Yeah.

1115
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:58,802
How much?

1116
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,780
How much what?

1117
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,011
How- how much?

1118
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,891
How much do I adore you?

1119
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:14,224
How much is Planck paying you?

1120
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,669
$200,000.

1121
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:33,876
You know, I could have just

1122
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:36,213
written you a check
and left it on the pillow.

1123
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,274
What?

1124
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,344
Oh, now I know why
you canceled with Jeremy.

1125
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,888
Hey, tell me this-

1126
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:42,787
Did you tell him
you were gonna fuck me,

1127
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,122
or was that just improvisation?

1128
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:11,368
...miles from nowhere.

1129
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,312
I kept thinking about you all the time.

1130
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:14,371
I couldn't sleep.

1131
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,145
It wasn't easy for me either.

1132
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:20,086
Ken, we've got a chance to be happy.
Let's not throw it away.

1133
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:21,315
Are you sure?

1134
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,982
I don't want to be sure
of anything...

1135
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,219
except that you love me.

1136
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:29,027
who managed to escape

1137
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:31,224
with little more
than a rack of chocolate bars.

1138
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:37,932
Oh, good Lord.

1139
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,337
What is it?

1140
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:41,638
I've discovered a black hole.

1141
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,871
Ha ha ha!

1142
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:47,177
Hey, I'm not doin' too well here.

1143
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:51,144
So you thought
she was the one, huh?

1144
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:56,920
Yeah. One in a billion.

1145
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,960
Well, let's not get carried away.

1146
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:03,361
The average guy meets about
900 women during the mating years,

1147
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:07,994
so- so you thought she was
the one in 900.

1148
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,126
I get it.

1149
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,835
Still, a devastating blow.

1150
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:17,936
Wh- what if that's it?

1151
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:31,752
Fuck.

1152
01:15:31,827 --> 01:15:33,624
Well, at least I still got you.

1153
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:46,205
Hey, I- you-

1154
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,266
Rudy!

1155
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:01,515
Rudy!

1156
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,647
He's invulnerable.

1157
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,810
Almost all proceeds.

1158
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:37,476
So, any idea
what she did with her bonus?

1159
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:38,985
Yeah, she's donating her fee

1160
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:41,887
to the Landmine...
something something...

1161
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:43,288
Children's Fund.

1162
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:45,189
- Oh, my God.
- You should be happy.

1163
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,922
No, they're the ones who had me
drop the suit against you.

1164
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:51,955
Arthur, uh- uh- uh-
she's got a book signing tomorrow.

1165
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:53,296
Don't bother.

1166
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,768
She's leaving for London
the next morning. Book tour.

1167
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,168
Well, I don't-

1168
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,570
I'll just go to London.

1169
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,631
Not hers. Her boyfriend's.

1170
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:03,542
Some horrible little book
about Romanticism.

1171
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:07,946
- She's going with him.
- Her boyfriend?

1172
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,449
Yeah. You're too late, Henry.

1173
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:11,441
Really.

1174
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:19,753
¶ Oh no, oh no, oh no ¶

1175
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:21,659
¶ Oh no, oh no ¶

1176
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:24,221

01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,098

1181
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:37,267

1182
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:40,337

1183
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:41,575

01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,811

1185
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,147

01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,415
¶ Oh no, oh no, oh no ¶

1187
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,980

01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,727
¶ Oh no, oh no ¶

1190
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,536
¶ Oh no, oh no, oh no ¶

01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:16,441

01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:19,309

01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,042
¶ Oh no, oh no ¶

1194
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:23,778
¶ Oh no, oh no, oh no ¶

1195
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:26,582

1197
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:30,547
¶ Oh no ¶

01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,786

01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:33,850

01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:36,693
¶ Oh no, oh no, oh no ¶

01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:39,461
¶ Oh no ¶

1202
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,390
Hey!

1203
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,878
...we both are.
We appreciate your support.

1204
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:06,436
I hope you like the book.

1205
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:28,930
Hey.

1206
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,341
Uh...

1207
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:43,173
I've never been good
at finding things.

1208
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,946
I'm really good at losing things-

1209
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,716
uh, the remote and keys
and parrots and people I like-

1210
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:50,451
Henry, go away.

1211
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,522
No.

1212
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:02,296
Come here.

1213
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:12,836
Oh, God.

1214
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:16,281
I've spent my whole life
wanting something...

1215
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,144
and doing my very best
not to find it.

1216
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:22,145
Never...

1217
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:27,260
even going near the places
it might be,

1218
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:28,317
and suddenly...

1219
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:32,356
I got the goddamn thing
practically chained around my neck.

1220
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,928
What are you talking about?

1221
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:36,993
You. You.

1222
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,768
You're the- you're-
you're the goddamn thing.

1223
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:41,331
You're-

1224
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:43,138
I mean, you're- you're-

1225
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:49,347
Aaahhh...
I can't describe you.

1226
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:52,648
I don't- I don't-
I don't write that kind of shit.

1227
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,153
I write-

1228
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:56,952
you know, the people
who write the real books,

1229
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:58,185
the love books and the poems

1230
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,591
and even those stupid
little fucking novels

1231
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,653
with the hunky assholes
on the cover.

1232
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:04,288
You know-
you know what I'm talking about?

1233
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:06,299
You're, like, princess shit.

1234
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:08,562
You know, fairy tales.
You know what I'm saying?

1235
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:10,365
The million guys are after her,

1236
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:12,269
and they're blinded
by your beauty kind of shit.

1237
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,740
Real big stuff, you know-

1238
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:19,041
even we got the dick who kidnaps you
and sticks you in a cave

1239
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,275
and you're guarded
by a five-headed dragon,

1240
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:24,079
and, you know, the tales of your plight
are spread throughout the land,

1241
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:26,120
and now all the guys go
and put on their shoes

1242
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:27,245
so they can see what's up,

1243
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:32,282
but none of them have-
have the balls to save her

1244
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,918
except for me.

1245
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:39,793
I would go through anything
for you.

1246
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:43,771
And still...

1247
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:47,935
there I was, looking for a way
not to see it.

1248
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:49,169
Anything.

1249
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:55,004
Money.

1250
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:03,454
Stupid idiot.

1251
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:06,282
Yes.

1252
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:07,589
Yeah.

1253
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,496
Yes, I'm a big, fat, stupid idiot.

1254
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,965
I hope you're better
to the next one.

1255
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,175
Wait.

1256
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:33,749
Let me show you something.

1257
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,311
All right.

1258
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:15,789
It was easy to find.

1259
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:21,624
It's the only one like it.

1260
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:32,772
You broke my heart, Henry.

1261
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,209
I don't think that you can...

1262
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:41,210
trust people.

1263
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:43,280
You always have to find
something wrong.

1264
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:48,594
I'm just- I'm sorry.

1265
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:56,058
I'll miss you.

1266
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,133
You'll be fine.

1267
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:39,141
We'll both be fine, Rudy.

1268
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,646
That's life, Henry.

1269
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:46,642
Yep.

1270
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:51,488
You know what life is?

1271
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:54,984
Life is...

1272
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,658
a horrible little giggle

1273
01:28:57,732 --> 01:29:01,259
in the midst of a forced
death march towards hell.

1274
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,497
No, it isn't.

1275
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,265
An interminable wail of grief.

1276
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,332
No.

1277
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:16,773
Life is a single skip for joy.

1278
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,120
I know.

1279
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:36,326
You hear that?

1280
01:29:37,839 --> 01:29:38,828
What?

1281
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:41,601
Look.

1282
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:19,309
You'll never throw it away again?

1283
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:20,369
Never.

1284
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:25,512
It's the only one like it.

1285
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:31,814
I know.

1286
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:50,871
¶ Oh no, oh no, oh no ¶

1287
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:52,708
¶ Oh no, oh no ¶

1288
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:55,271
¶ Oh no, oh no, oh no ¶

1289
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:58,341
¶ Oh no ¶

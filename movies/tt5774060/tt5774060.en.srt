00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:44,480
When you're underwater
for months at a time,

3
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:46,749
<i>you lose all sense
of day and night.</i>

4
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:51,188
<i>And there's only awake
and dreaming.</i>

5
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:54,992
<i>Not that those things
are easy to tell apart.</i>

6
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:01,964
<i>I think,</i>

7
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,932
<i>or I dream about
the first thing</i>

8
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,202
<i>he ever said to me.</i>

9
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,110
<i>Told me he didn't
believe in time...</i>

10
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:15,778
<i>only moments.</i>

11
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:19,014
Hmm.

12
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:20,417
<i>He was a
glass-half-full type.</i>

13
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:22,652
All right.

14
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:26,290
<i>I prefer it empty.</i>

15
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,764
What are you doing here?

16
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:41,738
<i>I mean, there's a
comfort to cynicism.</i>

17
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:46,143
<i>There's a lot
less to lose.</i>

18
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:05,520
Wake up!

19
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:07,157
Pressure breach!

20
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:12,793
Pressure breach!
We gotta get to the bulkhead!

21
00:07:12,795 --> 00:07:14,263
Structural
integrity compromised.

22
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:16,133
Everyone up! Everyone up!
Come on!

23
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,973
Structural integrity

24
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,741

25
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:27,044
Let's go! Pressure breach!

26
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:31,413

- No!
- <i>Bulkhead jammed.</i>

32
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,693
I gotta get inside
this thing now!

33
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,230
- <i>Reboot required.</i>
- Where is it? Where is it?

34
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:49,765
Oh, my God!

35
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,466
Come on!

36
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:55,105
De-pressurization warning.
Seal the bulkhead.

37
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:57,973
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

38
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:59,241
The whole rig
is about to implode!

39
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:00,475
If you don't shut these doors,

40
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:01,977
it'll take the whole station
with us!

41
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,012
Okay! Okay, okay, okay,
got it, got it, got it!

42

- <i>System online.</i>
- Shut the door!

43
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:07,549
- Wait!
- Hey, hey, hey.

44
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:08,550
Wait for us!

45
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:09,384

Guys, run! Come on, come on!

Come on, run!

50
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,026
Norah, Norah!
They're not gonna make it.

51
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,795
- Close the door!
- Norah!

52
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:21,999
We have to close the door,
otherwise the whole rig will die.

53
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:26,203
Shut the door now!

54

Hey, hey.

You okay?

61
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,344
Was that an earthquake?

62
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:42,413
I don't know.

63
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,151
Had to have been like
a ten or eleven.

64
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:50,452
I don't even know
what channel we'd be...

74
00:10:23,754 --> 00:10:24,655
We have to get to the pod bays.

75

Come on.

76
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:36,264
As a crew
member, we want you to know

77
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,300
<i>that you're not

a complaint?</i>

<i>Address it
to your superior officer.</i>

82
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,248
Oh, yes, working.

83
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,618
I just got to find
the nearest pods.

84
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:04,526
Senior engineers,
please report to engineering.

00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:05,596
Rodrigo, right?

86
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:08,532
Yeah.

87

Norah.

88
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,334
I-I know.

89
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,104
I usually work
with the day shift.

90
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:19,608
- Can you...? Can you help me out here?
- Sure, I can.

91
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,279
Um, are you a computer engineer
or something?

92
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:25,982
- Mechanical.
- Okay.

93
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:27,249
I can reset breakers.

94
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:30,354
I've been down here for a bit.

95

Hey, you gotta know...

96
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:42,466
that wasn't our fault.

97
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,667
I mean,
you-you saved the entire rig.

98
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,602
I... I didn't even know
to close the door.

99
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:48,505
Hmm.

100

<i>Bulkheads closed.</i>

that was an earthquake?

102
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,384
No.

103
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:03,453
I-I don't know.

104
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:07,422
That's not good.

105
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:09,624
The hardline's been severed.

106
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:13,094
Antenna's gone. I don't even
think we can reach the surface.

107
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:15,730
...to the nearest
escape pod as soon as possible.

108
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:17,835
There's-there's
evac pods in CR-7.

109

Hey, we got this, all right?

110
00:12:36,219 --> 00:12:38,522
Some of this water
is definitely sewage.

118
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,149
I'll look inside.

119
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,166
Yeah, I can fit up here,
if you can.

120

Come check.

123
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:37,312
Hello? Hello?

- Yeah.
- Okay.

132
00:13:58,268 --> 00:13:59,467
What do you need?

133
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:00,769
To get the heck out of here.

134
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:02,504
Yeah, yeah, I know.
What can I do?

135
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:03,875
- All right, all right.
- All right.

136

- Yeah, he's cool.

144
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,824
- Let me help you.
- You wanna try to stand up?

145
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:25,161
- Yeah.
- All right, buddy. Here we go.

146
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:26,394
Grab his arm?

147
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:28,229
No, no, no. Wait. No, no.

148
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:29,631
Okay, are you caught

No, no, no,

- Thank you.

Okay, I got my robe

- We're headed there, okay?
- Okay.

158
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:50,119
The upper decks are collapsing.
We gotta move fast.

160
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:53,388
You guys are crazy.

161

163
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:16,713
Hold up.

164
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,431
<i>Bulkheads closed.</i>

165
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:37,233
<i>Flooding contained.</i>

166
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:38,299
Okay.

167
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,479
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

168
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,952
There's-there's someone up here.

169
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:58,522
It's... It's McClellen.

170
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:28,986
Jesus.

171
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:30,922
Hey, Rod.

172
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,557
Come on, bud.

173
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:47,602
Guys, I see the pod bay.

174
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:50,206
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

175
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,775
<i>All Kepler crew...</i>

176
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:53,976
Cap?

177
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:55,743
Holy shit.
He stayed behind?

178
00:16:57,414 --> 00:16:58,948
Wait, why's he
just sitting there?

179
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,082
Oh, shit.

180
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:02,184
"Shit?" What's...
What's "oh shit"? What?

181
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:03,919
The evac pods are gone.

182
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,689
- I need the line open.
- Captain!

183
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:10,893
Hey!

184
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:13,195
Norah. You're alive.

185
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:14,296
Cap.

186
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,498
The door's jammed.

187
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:19,434
Rodrigo, Paul.

188
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,736
I need you two to check where
we are on submersible. Now.

189
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:24,173
All right, all right.

190
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:27,109
On a scale from one to ten,
how bad's my rig?

191
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:31,015
Uh, ten.

192
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:36,218
You're 70% compromised.

193
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,121
Honestly, you-you breathe
too hard in here, we're...

194
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,523
Wait. Let me see.

195
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:45,127
I don't get it. Was that
like an earthquake or...

196
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:47,564
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure it out.

197
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:51,532
Why are you still here?

198
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,269
You should have gone up.
There were pods here.

199
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:54,736
'Cause that's what captains do.

200
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:57,174
Who cares? You have a kid,
you should have gone up.

201
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,379
Can you, uh, can you
sit down, please?

202
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:04,646
Any one of us would have
shoved your ass

203
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:05,613
onto that pod immediately.

204
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:06,849
Listen to me.

205
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:08,317
Everybody's getting out
of here alive,

206
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,484
you hear me?

207
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:10,654
Okay?

208
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:13,423
Hold that on your ear.

209
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:17,425
I already sent 22 up.

210
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:18,559
Smith reported seven dead.

211
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:19,929
I found three.

212
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:22,664
It was, it was Lee,
Travis and McClellen,

213
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,465
and, um, um, McCl...

214
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,834
McClellen's hands
were still warm

215
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:27,702
so I-I know it was McClellen.

216
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:29,637
I mean, she lives
three floors up,

217
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:31,606
and I was brushing my teeth,
like, two hours ago.

218
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:33,342
- I-I had to shut the door on the entire East wing.
- Don't do this to yourself.

219
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:35,210
So, actually, you know what,
there could be more.

220
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:36,511
Stop thinking back,
look forward.

221
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:38,981
Look forward. Look at me.

222
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:42,284
Now you follow the light.
Come on.

223
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:43,888
Follow the light.
<i>Ça va ça va.</i>

224
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,990
<i>Cap,
that isa no-go on the submersibles.</i>

225
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:49,158
<i>Copy that.</i>

226
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,095
<i>I'm sending Norah
to the control room.</i>

227
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,133
Emily, are you okay? Hey.

228
00:18:58,135 --> 00:18:59,567
- Oh, my gosh. You're alive.
- Norah?

229
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:00,804
- Hey.
- You're alive.

230
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:03,339
- Dude.
- Ah, I hate that.

231
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:05,174
- Have you heard anything?
- No, no. Nothing.

232
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:09,011
- How are the cooling towers?
- I haven't checked 'em yet.

233
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,079
- You wanna do it?
- Yeah, yeah.

234
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,981
See if anybody's
alive out there.

235
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,581
<i>...compromised.</i>

236
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,719
<i>Bulkheads closed...</i>

237
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:18,488
Hey, hey.

238
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:24,293
Someone's coming. Right?

239
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:25,828
They're gonna...
They're gonna send someone.

240
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,296
I don't know. Thank you.

241
00:19:27,298 --> 00:19:29,064
I'm pretty sure
they already sent someone.

242
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:32,101
I'm less sure we have the time
to wait for them.

243
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:33,202
- Norah.
- Yeah.

244
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:36,671
So, the cooling towers?
What are we getting?

245
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,074
Oh, um...

246
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:41,910
Nothing good.

247
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:43,544
All the upper decks
have collapsed

248
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:45,813
and we lost the cooling towers.

249
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:47,850
The core of the Kepler
is completely unstable.

250
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,084
Wait, what do you
mean "unstable"?

251
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:50,551
Like, poof,
we all die "unstable"?

252
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:51,519
What are we
talking about here, Norah?

253
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:53,355
The thermal cores.

254
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,190
That's a lot of energy
with nowhere to go.

255
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,992
Okay, the intern's
freaking me out.

256
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:58,726
Can somebody just explain
what the hell's going on here?

257
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:00,062
Research assistant.

258
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:01,763
No, there-there... There's a...
There's a, um...

259
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:02,998
If there's a meltdown,
there's gonna be a lot of heat.

260
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,766
There's gonna be
a flash boil, explosions.

261
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:06,869
I don't really know. I watch a
lot of anime. That's all I know.

262
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,437
Oh, you watch anime?
I like anime.

263
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:12,807
No, I mean, he's right.

264
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,943
We have about 30 minutes
till meltdown.

265
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:17,880
And, uh, it's gonna blow us
into tiny pieces to the surface.

266
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:20,115
And people are gonna find us,
like, floating around.

267
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:22,518
<i>Bulkhead compromised.</i>

268
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,253
Okay, guys, listen.

269
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:27,423
The escape pods are gone
and the sub is out of order.

270
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,791
And we're not getting
any more radio signals.

271
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:31,894
And the structure of the Kepler
is totally unsound.

272
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,694
Captain, there better be
a good punchline,

273
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:34,762
'cause this setup is...

274
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:36,133
- So weak.
- ...weak.

275
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:40,436
We go for the Roebuck.

276
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:42,271
The Roebuck?

277
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:43,972
It's a mile down
and a mile that way.

278
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,541
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah.

279
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:47,044
How would we even get there?

280
00:20:49,313 --> 00:20:50,379
We walk.

281
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:51,447
We what?

282
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,481
Walk.

283
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:54,083
We walk?

284
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:56,218
That's what you dug me
out of the rubble for?

285
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,286
I can't walk.

286
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,420
I don't even have a suit.

287
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:00,556
Listen, listen. Listen to me.

288
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,225
Here's what we're gonna do.

289
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:06,328
We're gonna drop down to the
cargo elevator to the seafloor.

290
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,099
Then we use the access tunnel
to get to the Midpoint station.

291
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:13,068
There we can charge
and clean the rebreathers.

292
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,237
And then we follow the markers

293
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:18,173
across the plateau
to the Roebuck.

294
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,544
So we just go in the pitch black

295
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:24,346
and we walk without knowing
where we're going

296
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:25,613
with insufficient oxygen?

297
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:27,082
- That's the plan?
- That's the plan.

298
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,616
Everybody down with that?
Norah, you okay with that?

299
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:30,853
The suits can't be down there
that long. You know that.

300
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:33,355
Not everyone here
is an experienced diver and...

301
00:21:33,357 --> 00:21:34,456
Than we never know.

302
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:35,926
I'm-I'm not trying to be...

303
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:39,161
Can you just admit
we might die doing that?

304
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:42,665
Yeah. But can you admit
that we might live doing this?

305
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,300
Hey, what about
the old Shepard Station?

306
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:46,602
Isn't that closer?

307
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:49,404
Shepard Station's gone.
There's nothing there.

308
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:52,376
Uh, you guys,
you need to hear this.

309
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,245
Can this be
something good?

310
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:58,213
Could we please have
one good thing? Could we?

311
00:21:58,215 --> 00:22:00,748
I think this was the last
transmission from the drill site.

312
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,820
<i>Mayday, mayday!</i>

313
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:08,290
<i>We've been compromised by category ten...</i>

314
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:21,203
Now, what the hell
was that noise?

315
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:26,942
Also, the temperature outside
jumped ten degrees.

316
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:29,945
Great, so it'll be warm when
we're walking across the plateau.

317
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:31,880
The water doesn't do that.
That's impossible.

318
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:37,152
That's just aftershocks
from the last earthquake, okay?

319
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:39,021
It's 'cause
we drilled too deep. Okay?

320
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:40,923
It's those tectonic plates
I talk about all the time.

321
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:43,724
This is insane.
Okay, this is insane.

322
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:45,162
We go for the Roebuck.

323
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:57,372
What? If we're gonna
do this, let's do it!

324
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:58,309
Am I right?

325
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,710
All right, we can compromise.
I can turn it down.

326
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:05,514
Emily.

327
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:07,418
Lose your pants.
They won't fit in the suit.

328
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:12,089
<i>Deck A compromised.</i>

329
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:16,458
<i>Bulkheads closed.</i>

330
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,995
<i>Flooding contained.</i>

331
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:34,044
Has anyone ever
walked out there before?

332
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:38,249
Longer than to fix a pipe.
I mean, just...

333
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:40,951
Just walked?

334
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:43,087
No.

335
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:46,787
Check if we have enough helmets.

336
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:48,791
I just need you to find
six good ones.

337
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:55,232
Hey, Norah.

338
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:57,332
Hey.

339
00:23:57,334 --> 00:23:58,936
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

340
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:03,007
Hey. How you doing?

341
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:04,840
You ready?

342
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:05,943
All right.

343
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:17,087
These are ripped too? Come on!

344
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:27,998
All right, this is gonna suck.

345
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:30,165
Okay.

346
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,967
Oh, sorry, sorry!

347
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:34,336
Okay. Good?

348
00:24:34,338 --> 00:24:35,306
Go suit up.

349
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,012
Your air is good.

350
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:53,655
Thank you.

351
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:55,859
Okay, clear
all this shit from the deck.

352
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:08,170
What are you thinking?

353
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:09,137
I'm thinking
I really didn't like

354
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:11,573
the sound on that transmission.

355
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:12,609
We should take something.

356
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:16,246
Yeah.

357
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:19,114
That's a very valid point.

358
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:21,950
Okay. Let me see your back.

359
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:23,454
Okay. Last checks.

360
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:26,223
Let's go.

361
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,792
All right, listen up.

362
00:25:30,794 --> 00:25:34,396
We watch our descent rate
and follow all safety protocols.

363
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:36,934
Remember,
these suits are dangerous.

364
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:41,972
Hey, what's so funny?

365
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:48,710
- I can't do this. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

366
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:51,179
Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
Yes, you can.

367
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:53,949
It's all right. It's all right.
It's just an elevator, all right?

368
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:55,751
It's all lit up
to the weigh station.

369
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:56,752
You just follow the pipeline.

370
00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:59,521
You can do it. Come on, come on.

371
00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:01,525
Hey, what's the scariest
part of a roller coaster?

372
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:04,326
Waiting in line.

373
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:06,630
Ready?

374
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:10,766
I'm gonna be right there
with you. Every step.

375
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:12,734
<i>Main bridge compromised.</i>

376
00:26:12,736 --> 00:26:13,904
We have to move.

377
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:16,972
All right.
Everybody in the pool.

378
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:18,273
Okay, we gotta go.

379
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:20,308
That was one level above us.

380
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,110
This one's next. Let's go.

381
00:26:22,112 --> 00:26:23,914
<i>...integrity compromised.</i>

382
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:28,750
<i>Structural integrity
compromised.</i>

383
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:29,684
<i>Take us down.</i>

384
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:31,420
<i>"If you don't know
where you're going,</i>

385
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,722
<i>any road can get
you there."</i>

386
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:34,891
<i>Dude.</i>

387
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,525
<i>What? It's not me, Norah.
It's from a book.</i>

388
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:37,492
<i>Let's go.</i>

389
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:40,264
<i>We all know you
can't read.</i>

390
00:27:08,592 --> 00:27:10,292
All right,
I don't wanna scare anyone,

391
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:11,660
<i>but once we get
to the depth</i>

392
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:13,630
<i>we're gonna have to
jump to the cargo lift.</i>

393
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,402
<i>Okay, here we go.
Shit.</i>

394
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:23,004
Exterior hatch,
it's ripped to shreds.

395
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:24,105
<i>Everybody, get ready.</i>

396
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:25,240
<i>Hang onto
something 'cause</i>

397
00:27:25,242 --> 00:27:27,242
<i>pressure's gonna
hit us hard.</i>

398
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:28,343
<i>Override it.</i>

399
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:29,980
<i>As long as it opens,
we'll be fine.</i>

400
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:34,015
Captain, I don't know
what's going on with this thing.

401
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:34,917
<i>Well,
keep trying.</i>

402
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:38,955
<i>Rodrigo.</i>

403
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,255
<i>Guys, what's going on?</i>

404
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:42,125
<i>Keep the door closed.
Keep the door closed!</i>

405
00:27:54,171 --> 00:27:56,607
Stay where you are.
Close your eyes.

406
00:27:58,342 --> 00:28:00,744
It's okay, Em.
You're good, you're good.

407
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,881
<i>Listen. Listen.</i>

408
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,781
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

409
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,454
Let's go, Emily.
Step to the edge.

410
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:47,658
<i>You have to jump now.</i>

411
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,095
<i>Norah, he's gone.</i>

412
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:55,165
<i>It's your turn.
You need to jump.</i>

413
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,550
He knew that
that helmet was faulty.

414
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:17,154
I mean, I-I-I know
that he knew it.

415
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:18,820
Listen.

416
00:29:18,822 --> 00:29:21,456
I know how you feel.
I know it's unfair.

417
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,028
But you're gonna have to
take it and use it.

418
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,698
Yeah. Okay.

419
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,764
Come on.

420
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:30,565
The sooner we get clear

421
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:31,702
of the station the better.

422
00:29:58,128 --> 00:30:00,163
I've never seen
anyone die before.

423
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:05,268
I saw somebody die.

424
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:09,506
I've never seen anybody implode.

425
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,747
What are you laughing at?

426
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,116
Uh, I was just
thinking of this thing

427
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,217
that Rodrigo did sometimes.

428
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:23,551
He'd always say
he had a new joke,

429
00:30:23,553 --> 00:30:25,520
and then he'd tell
the same stupid joke.

430
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:28,860
I was... laughing at that joke.

431
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,760
Yeah, what was it?

432
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:34,729
What did the fish say when
it bumped into the brick wall?

433
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:39,236
"Dam."

434
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,872
Pretty stupid joke.

435
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:06,227
It looks like
whatever it is

436
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:07,830
might be on the deck below us.

437
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,135
I think it's a distress signal
from one of the pods.

438
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,371
How far?

439
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:16,972
Two hundred more meters.

440
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:19,274
Why wouldn't it be
going to the surface?

441
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:20,677
Maybe it's only got
half a charge.

442
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:23,445
Uh...

443
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:25,248
It's definitely stopped
on the platform below us.

444
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,851
Survivor.

445
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:28,920
It could be a survivor.

446
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:33,621
Guys, somebody's gonna
have to suit up.

447
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:35,590
All right, Emily,
this is your time.

448
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:36,560
What?

449
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:38,562
I'm just messing with you.

450
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,532
Here, take him.

451
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:45,868
Take this bunny.

452
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,904
I bequeath it to you.

453
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,139
If he doesn't make it,
I'll haunt you.

454
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,573
Let's go, guys.

455
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:53,843
We don't know how long
until the Kepler blows.

456
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,777
Let's go put
our lives in danger.

457
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,614
- Be careful.
- We'll be right back.

458
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:03,152
Paul's crazy. Right?

459
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:06,188
Yeah. I guess so.

460
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,389
<i>Hey,
Captain, what do we do?</i>

461
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:09,992
With the body, when we find it.

462
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,128
We're talking about
a possible survivor, Paul.

463
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,328
<i>Okay.</i>

464
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,064
<i>Then hypothetically.</i>

465
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,799
<i>Let's say we were to come
across a body and it was dead.</i>

466
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,936
Just grab something
we can take back to his family.

467
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,506
<i>It's okay. I
know what to do.</i>

468
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:26,708
Oh, really?
We got G.I. Joe over here.

469
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,344
And we are about to touch...

470
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:34,216
in three, two, one.

471
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:39,054
We're locked in.

472
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:40,055
<i>All right.</i>

473
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:41,058
- <i>Ready?</i>
- Yeah.

474
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:44,559
<i>Yeah. Yeah!</i>

475
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:46,228
Let's get this done
before the Kepler

476
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,462
<i>comes down on our asses.</i>

477
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:48,998
Okay.

478
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,801
Turn on all the camera feeds
we have available.

479
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,970
How long can
someone survive in a pod?

480
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,874
If he lost power, not long.

481
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,743
Especially at this depth.

482
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:04,046
Okay, guys, we're starting
the decompression now.

483
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,349
Are either of you two married?

484
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,485
Was.

485
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:11,488
Kids?

486
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,255
Daughter.

487
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,322
How-how old is she?

488
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:15,925
Fourteen.

489
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,592
That's a tough age for a girl.

490
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:19,931
I mean, it's-it's a phase.
It will pass.

491
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:22,131
She's not 14.

492
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,399
Allie? She's gotta be
like my age, right?

493
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:26,369
Who said 14? Did I say that?

494
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,403
Yeah.

495
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:30,405
Well, I don't know
why I said it.

496
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:31,606
You're losing it, old man.

497
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:33,142
You're going senile down here.

498
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,744
It's actually a normal
neurological reaction.

499
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:37,847
When you're facing death,
time just...

500
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,983
Listen to me. Listen to me.

501
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:43,054
You're not gonna die. Okay?

502
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:47,524
<i>All right.</i>

503
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,159
<i>Worst idea ever.</i>

504
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,560
<i>Let's do it anyway.</i>

505
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:54,362
<i>Helmets on.
Locked and loaded.</i>

506
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:55,630
Either of you have dogs?

507
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:56,731
<i>Flood it, Norah!</i>

508
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,733
Flooding.

509
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:01,839
I have a corgi.

510
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,977
Not house-trained, so he's
kind of a nightmare right now,

511
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,811
but I didn't think
I would miss him this much.

512
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:12,749
Okay, hatch is sealed.
We're outside.

513
00:34:14,684 --> 00:34:16,020
Okay, I'll put us on standby.

514
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,455
Turn the floodlights on, please.

515
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,901
Cap, this platform's
not too stable.

516
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,071
<i>I, uh, don't know how long
we should be out here.</i>

517
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,752
<i>Oh, God.</i>

518
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:56,125
Guys, keep on walking forward.

519
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,359
Like 20 meters.

520
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,762
<i>Check what's
on the right.</i>

521
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,167
<i>I can't see shit.
My right or his right?</i>

522
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:11,608
<i>What the
hell is that?</i>

523
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:17,478
<i>Am I cracking up
or is there, like,</i>

524
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,116
<i>like, a bird
chirping right now?</i>

525
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,452
We're not hearing
anything up here.

526
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,790
All right,
Captain, talk to us.

527
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,758
<i>We close? We can't see
anything out here.</i>

528
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,097
Honestly, you should be
right in front of it.

529
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,166
<i>Okay.</i>

530
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:40,770
<i>I can't see shit.</i>

531
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:49,612
<i>Oh, hold up.</i>

532
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:51,849
<i>You see that?</i>

533
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,351
<i>Holy shit.</i>

534
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,921
<i>What the hell
happened to this thing?</i>

535
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:03,961
<i>Looks like it imploded.
There's, uh, something.</i>

536
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,697
<i>Something all over it.</i>

537
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:09,766
<i>You seeing this?</i>

538
00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:13,634
What is that?

539
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:14,870
I would need to take
a closer look.

540
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,905
It could be
some sort of an-an algae.

541
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:18,508
You ever see
anything like that?

542
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,676
<i>This looks...</i>

543
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:23,080
<i>It doesn't look
like algae.</i>

544
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:26,647
Is there anybody in it?

545
00:36:26,649 --> 00:36:27,617
<i>Empty.</i>

546
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:29,819
<i>I got something.</i>

547
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:32,655
<i>Wallet.</i>

548
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,228
<i>Great. We can use
his credit cards.</i>

549
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,797
<i>All right, Captain,
there's no body,</i>

550
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:44,199
<i>so can we please
and thank you</i>

551
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:46,003
<i>get the hell out of here
before we...</i>

552
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,406
<i>Scratch that. There's a body.
It's entangled...</i>

553
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,639
They should just come back.

554
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:52,910
<i>...in the coils.</i>

555
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,151
Dude, don't check it out.
Just come back.

556
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,584
- Just come back.
- <i>Wait.</i>

557
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:04,821
<i>Do you see his back?</i>

558
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,560
- <i>Can you guys see that?</i>
- Let's just bring them back.

559
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:13,661
Okay, come back, guys.

560
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:14,664
<i>Paul.</i>

561
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,667
<i>Whoa. Smith.</i>

562
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,237
Paul.

563
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,043
The hell's going on
with his body?

564
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:32,548
<i>Did the pressure...
liquefy...</i>

565
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,753
<i>Paul, hold
still! God!</i>

566
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,892
What is that thing?

567
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,726
All I know is that it was
eating a dead body

568
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:47,198
and then it came at me.

569
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,402
Em, what are you doing?

570
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,104
Uh, I'm just looking for its...

571
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,771
Oh, no, no!

572
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:58,440
See?

573
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,877
Looking for its mouth.

574
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,980
Is it still alive?

575
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,849
- No, no, no.
- 'Cause I will kill it.

576
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,450
I think I just touched a nerve.

577
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,487
Norah, how much
further do we have?

578
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,355
Two hundred meters
away from the bottom.

579
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,756
It doesn't have any eyes.

580
00:38:15,758 --> 00:38:17,692
How are they attracted
to the light?

581
00:38:17,694 --> 00:38:18,961
Oh, my God, look at this.

582
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,795
Maybe they're like moths.

583
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:22,797
Underwater moths.

584
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:24,900
It's like talons.

585
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,869
I think this might be
a new species.

586
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,504
Do we get to name it?

587
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,072
I shot it. I'm naming it.

588
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,146
I've never seen
sea life like this down here.

589
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,285
Unless... Unless we bored
into a hydrothermal pocket.

590
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,123
If it was sustained heat
that could support life...

591
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,223
Are you serious?

592
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,326
Everybody stay calm. Stay calm.

593
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:53,295
- Oh, my God.
- Norah, what'd you get?

594
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,729
Nothing.
It's not just the lights.

595
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:56,532
The whole system's down.

596
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,333
Can you put us in neutral?
Glide the rest of the way?

597
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,170
Yeah.

598
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,040
We have access to the cable?

599
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,409
If we can disengage, definitely.

600
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,249
What was that?

601
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,702
This better not be some

602
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:37,141
<i>Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea</i> shit, man.

603
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:57,059
- Paul.
- What the hell?

604
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:57,960
I'm just joking.

605
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:58,961
But it does sound like

606
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,130
there's something out there.

607
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:10,239
It's probably not a good time
to ask, but is that a baby?

608
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,252
Should we close that door?

609
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,496
I'm gonna close it.
I'm gonna close that door.

610
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,251
Okay.

611
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,720
We gotta find a way to get down.

612
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,058
We're completely disengaged.
I don't know why we're not moving yet.

613
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,938
Oh, my God!

614
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,075
What the hell was that?

615
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,044
- Oh, my God!
- The Kepler exploded!

616
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,045
The Kepler!

617
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,814
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

618
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,218
Captain!

619
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,852
Into the pressure chamber!

620
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:31,889
Oh, God!

621
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,125
We have to open
the outside hatch

622
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,660
before we hit the seafloor!

623
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,531
Or we get crushed! Move!

624
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,967
Flood it! Flood it!

625
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,842
Helmet, now!
Here we go! Come on!

626
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,809
<i>Help!</i>

627
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,177
<i>Hang on!</i>

628
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,978
Here we go.
Open the hatch!

629
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,915
<i>All right.</i>

630
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,960
<i>Run! Run! Run!</i>

631
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,400
<i>Watch it! Watch it!</i>

632
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:21,939
<i>Norah.</i>

633
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,943
<i>Hey, guys!
I'm over here.</i>

634
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,280
<i>Come to the green light.
I'm at the entrance.</i>

635
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,048
<i>Watch out, Smith!</i>

636
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,151
<i>Emily, watch
out!</i>

637
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,552
<i>Keep your eyes closed.</i>

638
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:38,420
<i>Keep 'em closed.</i>

639
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,523
<i>I don't know
what happened.</i>

640
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,458
<i>Come on, take him.</i>

641
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,026
<i>To the pipeline entrance!</i>

642
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:46,163
<i>Come on.</i>

643
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,303
I can't get
the goddamn door open!

644
00:42:55,305 --> 00:42:56,705
<i>Smith, can you hear me?</i>

645
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,543
<i>It's gonna be okay, buddy.
You're gonna be okay.</i>

646
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:17,692
<i>Come on.</i>

647
00:43:17,694 --> 00:43:19,361
<i>Let's get him clear
of the door!</i>

648
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,595
<i>Get him up. Get him up.</i>

649
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,766
Get him up.
Get him up. Get him up.

650
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,336
What happened? Are you okay?

651
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:29,771
He inhaled some fumes.
He's okay.

652
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,673
His oxygen scrubber took a hit.

653
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:34,576
We all saw this, right?
There are things out there.

654
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,246
Fuck our lives!

655
00:43:45,622 --> 00:43:46,889
See?
There's something out there.

656
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:48,323
Oh, my God.

657
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:51,293
Paul, stop.
It's just debris falling.

658
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,130
Norah, call the mover.

659
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:54,531
All right.

660
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,567
Look at me.

661
00:43:58,569 --> 00:43:59,636
How's your sight?

662
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,636
I'm good.

663
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,641
- It's gonna be all right, man.
- Okay.

664
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:08,579
I don't have the code.
I-I can't get in here.

665
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:15,586
Ears.

666
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:17,688
Eh, forget it.

667
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:25,260
- Give me your hand.
- Two, three!

668
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,442
It's gonna be fine, buddy. Yeah.

669
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:43,046
All right. We ride this
to the Midpoint Station.

670
00:44:47,784 --> 00:44:49,052
We're halfway there, guys.

671
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:51,021
Halfway there.

672
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:23,184
Paul, stop the cart.

673
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:24,454
It's not gonna go
in that kind of water.

674
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,189
Stop it.

675
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:32,794
That's a lot of water.

676
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,329
The pumps are probably jammed.

677
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,531
What happens
if they don't turn back on?

678
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:39,167
Anybody else wanna take that?

679
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,302
No?

680
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,437
In the book, Alice cried so much

681
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,941
she almost drowned
in her own tears.

682
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:47,142
Luckily, she could swim.

683
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,878
It got pretty rough
for her after that.

684
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,519
There's definitely
something following us.

685
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:02,225
Okay. I'm getting very close
to shitting myself.

686
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,845
Looks like somebody got
a care package.

687
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:24,448
Cheetos and...

688
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,650
Oh, the irony.

689
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:31,622
I love MoonPies.

690
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:38,495
This is someone's stuff.

691
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,699
This is all someone's...

692
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,569
Oh...

693
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,303
Oh...

694
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,406
Oh, my God.

695
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,260
Keep moving. Keep moving.

696
00:47:11,294 --> 00:47:13,728
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,065
Come on, guys,
we're almost there.

698
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:17,467
It should be 300 meters ahead.

699
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,917
Is this it?

700
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:36,351
We can't go back.

701
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,487
What does that mean?

702
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:39,456
It's too tight.

703
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,723
Oh, no.

704
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,458
We've got to find
another way.

705
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,228
I'm the smallest. Let me check.

706
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:46,964
Here.

707
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:49,999
Okay.

708
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:51,501
Let me connect you with my line.

709
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:53,637
Attached.

710
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:58,508
Thank you.

711
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,005
All right, I'm through.
It's open out here.

712
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,606
And I think you guys
can definitely make it.

713
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:32,975
It's really tight but...

714
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,542
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Huh?

715
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,443
<i>We're sending Emily.</i>

716
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:36,480
Yeah, okay.

717
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,381
Attached.

718
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:51,359
<i>Captain's
on his way.</i>

719
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,395
Hey, come here.

720
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:55,933
Nice.

721
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:04,206
Hey.

722
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,774
How you holding up?

723
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,610
I'm okay.

724
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,012
Um, I was gonna eat this,

725
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:11,981
but Lil Paul and I decided

726
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:13,683
that you should
give it to your girl.

727
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:15,987
- MoonPie.
- Yeah.

728
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:17,989
MoonPie.

729
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,890
Thanks, man.

730
00:49:20,892 --> 00:49:22,824
She's pretty cool.

731
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:24,896
Gotta make sure
not to screw that up.

732
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:27,832
Yeah.

733
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,138
Smith.

734
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,372
<i>Your turn. Come on.</i>

735
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,409
All right, Cap's through.
I'm going.

736
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,916
<i>All right, guys.
I'm coming through.</i>

737
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:53,721
How are you doing in there, buddy?

738
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:55,092
You want your bunny heater?

739
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,536
All right, forget this.
We're going in.

740
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,338
Hey. You okay?

741
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,541
- Paul, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

742
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,743
- You okay?
- Yeah.

743
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:17,345
- <i>What is that?</i>
- Huh?

744
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,914
Paul?
Paul, are you reading?

745
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,715
Don't screw around. Let's go.

746
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,517
Hey, Paul, you copy?

747
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,385
We're gonna pull you through.

748
00:50:24,387 --> 00:50:25,820
- All right, pull.
- All right.

749
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:26,656
Here we go.

750
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,501
- Come on.
- I'm pulling. I'm pulling.

751
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,435
Come on.

752
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:41,538
Shit!

753
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,041
Come on, come on.

754
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:50,045
There he is.

755
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,014
You scared the shit out of me.

756
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:54,616
There's something back there.
Some Slender Man-type shit.

757
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:55,717
Hey, that's not funny.

758
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:58,956
What's wrong with my line?

759
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:03,826
Smith, unclip.
He's all tangled up.

760
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:04,794
- Okay, I got it.
- Oh, no!

761
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:08,065
Unclip, unclip, unclip!

762
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,565
Take Lil Paul! Take Lil Paul!

763
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,666
Give me my helmet!

764
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,468
It's pulling me underwater!

765
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,702
He's going! Helmet!

766
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:15,503
- My helmet!
- Helmet, now!

767
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,773
Get it on! Get it on!

768
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:18,742
Grab him! Grab him!

769
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,451
Grab him! Grab him!

770
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:34,524
I can't hold him!

771
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,129
Oh, my God!

772
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:42,532
Oh, my God!

773
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:44,467
Paul!

774
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,172
Get out of the water!

775
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,741
- Emily, go!
- Get to the bulkhead!

776
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:12,094
<i>Calling CQ. Calling CQ.
This is Captain Lucien.</i>

777
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:15,132
<i>We're at the Midway Station.
It's heavily damaged.</i>

778
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:18,936
Not sure how long it will last.

779
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,572
Does anyone copy?

780
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:25,977
It ripped him out of the suit.

781
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,713
It ripped him right out
of his goddamn suit.

782
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:32,214
What could do that?

783
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:33,715
<i>Begin evacuation</i>

784
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,284
<i>to surface immediately.</i>

785
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:36,653
CQ, do you copy?

786
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:40,490
<i>Overwatch
tower is online.</i>

787
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,592
What is happening?

788
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:50,001
That drill weighs 6,000 tons.

789
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:53,803
How did it get
ripped up like that?

790
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:57,507
We did this.

791
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:02,213
We drilled
the bottom of the ocean.

792
00:53:03,646 --> 00:53:05,149
We took too much.

793
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,518
And now she's taking back.

794
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,625
We're not supposed to be
down here.

795
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:19,230
No one is.

796
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:23,300
She's not wrong.

797
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,148
Listen.

798
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:39,649
I know Paul's gone, but...

799
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,154
we can't stay here.

800
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,622
What about Smith's suit?

801
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,590
Let me take a look
at your oxygen scrubber.

802
00:53:49,592 --> 00:53:50,961
- Hmm.
- Come on.

803
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:00,938
How is it?

804
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:06,643
The suit's not gonna make it.

805
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,819
You guys gotta
go without me. We... I'm...

806
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:18,923
I'm just gonna be
dead weight out there.

807
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,029
- I can't lose anybody else.
- Me neither.

808
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,331
Stop.

809
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:36,173
Okay,
Smith, you can lean on me.

810
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:39,676
<i>Take short,
shallow breaths.</i>

811
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:41,709
<i>Okay.</i>

812
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:42,947
<i>It's gonna be all right.
I got you.</i>

813
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,357
<i>Okay, there's Marker 21.</i>

814
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:32,127
<i>All we do now is follow
these across the plateau.</i>

815
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:34,231
<i>The Roebuck Station
will be at Marker Zero.</i>

816
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,826
<i>What did you see? Huh?</i>

817
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:09,400
<i>I don't know.</i>

818
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:22,144
- I just saw it.
- Oh, my God!

819
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:23,312
<i>I saw that.</i>

820
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:24,046
<i>Set him down.</i>

821
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:25,614
<i>What was that?</i>

822
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:26,816
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

823
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:29,987
<i>Where is it? Where is it?</i>

824
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:36,894
<i>Turn off the lights.</i>

825
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:39,830
<i>Don't move.</i>

826
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:46,337
<i>I'm gonna turn my IR on.</i>

827
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:52,876
<i>Norah, did you
get my feed?</i>

828
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:54,511
Yeah.

829
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,663
<i>Smith?</i>

830
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:16,267
<i>Where's Smith? Norah?</i>

831
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,368
- <i>Where is he?</i>
- Do you see him?

832
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,535
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

833
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:22,037
- <i>Smith!</i>
- <i>Emily.</i>

834
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:23,538
- <i>Smith?</i>
- Smith!

835
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,442
<i>Emily. Help.</i>

836
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,914
- <i>That's his foot.</i>
- I'm going.

837
00:57:32,516 --> 00:57:33,917
<i>I'm hooking
onto you. Here.</i>

838
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:44,862
<i>I see him.</i>

839
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:56,340
<i>I got him.</i>

840
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:00,244
<i>He's alive. He's alive.</i>

841
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:02,913
<i>I'm pulling him back.</i>

842
00:58:05,382 --> 00:58:06,481
<i>Okay.</i>

843
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,118
<i>Just push him.
We'll grab his feet.</i>

844
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,653
<i>Smith, can you hear us?</i>

845
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,221
Smith, please! Can you hear us?

846
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,589
<i>I gotta grab the gun.</i>

847
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,360
<i>What?
Forget the gun.</i>

848
00:58:17,895 --> 00:58:19,096
<i>Captain, leave it.</i>

849
00:58:23,701 --> 00:58:24,535
Cap.

850
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,574
<i>Cap, what are you doing?</i>

851
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:34,676
- <i>Norah!</i>
- No!

852
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:37,446
<i>No!</i>

853
00:58:37,448 --> 00:58:38,449
<i>No!</i>

854
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,529
<i>Norah?</i>

855
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,432
<i>You okay?</i>

856
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:59,501
<i>I can't see you.
Can you see me?</i>

857
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:03,207
<i>Norah?</i>

858
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,442
<i>Where are you?</i>

859
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:10,112
I'm underneath you.
Can you see me?

860
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:12,581
<i>Cap, can
you hear me?</i>

861
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:13,417
<i>Norah.</i>

862
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,185
<i>Where are you?</i>

863
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:20,055
<i>I'm here.
Underneath.</i>

864
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:23,258
<i>I'm all tangled.
Can you see me?</i>

865
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,194
<i>Yeah.</i>

866
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,130
<i>Okay, hold on.</i>

867
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:33,935
<i>Where is it?</i>

868
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,470
<i>I don't know.</i>

869
00:59:35,472 --> 00:59:36,440
<i>Get me
out of here.</i>

870
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,578
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Shit.

871
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:45,115
<i>Okay, let me see
if I can help you. Hold on.</i>

872
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:48,885
<i>Can you reach my knife?</i>

873
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:54,425
<i>What was that?</i>

874
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:06,937
<i>Norah.</i>

875
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:08,939
<i>Is it back?</i>

876
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,341
<i>What do you see?</i>

877
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:13,644
<i>Is it back?</i>

878
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:27,658
<i>Norah!</i>

879
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,235
<i>Norah!</i>

880
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,980
<i>Oh, I got you. I got you.
I'm with you.</i>

881
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,715
<i>I'm with you.</i>

882
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:55,550
<i>Pressure level critical.</i>

883
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:56,485
<i>We're
rising too fast!</i>

884
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:58,186
<i>The pressure's gonna
kill us both!</i>

885
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:00,290
<i>Please slow ascent.</i>

886
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,495
<i>Norah.</i>

887
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:09,798
<i>Let go.</i>

888
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,700
<i>Suit
integrity, ten percent.</i>

889
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:12,703
<i>Norah,
look at me.</i>

890
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,037
<i>Let go, God damn it!</i>

891
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,273
No, I can't. I can't. I can't.

892
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:19,243
<i>Four percent.</i>

893
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:22,277
<i>Three percent.</i>

894
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:23,411
<i>No, no, no. No, no, no.</i>

895
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,446
<i>Two percent.</i>

896
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:25,716
<i>It's gonna be all right.</i>

897
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,516
<i>No, don't do that.</i>

898
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:29,084
<i>One percent.</i>

899
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:30,053
<i>Don't do that!
Don't do that!</i>

900
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:13,297
<i>Emily, can
you hear me?</i>

901
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,803
<i>Emily, Smith,
can you hear me?</i>

902
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:04,574
<i>I'm still alive. I'm at
the old Shepard drill.</i>

903
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,843
<i>There's no...</i>

904
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:10,378
<i>There's no pods here
but I can breathe.</i>

905
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,613
<i>I have some air.</i>

906
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:12,749
<i>If you guys are
out there...</i>

907
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:16,653
<i>Is anyone reading?</i>

908
01:04:21,893 --> 01:04:22,894
Emily, can you hear me?

909
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,703
Can you guys hear me?

910
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:02,265
Cap.

911
01:05:27,024 --> 01:05:27,925
Allie.

912
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:36,834
I'm sorry.

913
01:07:23,975 --> 01:07:25,540
<i>Guys, I'm just gonna
keep talking.</i>

914
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,810
<i>I don't know if
you can hear me.</i>

915
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:35,887
<i>I'm following
the southeast line.</i>

916
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:38,455
<i>Following the markers.</i>

917
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:40,457
<i>To the Roebuck.</i>

918
01:07:43,261 --> 01:07:44,996
<i>I used to love the ocean.</i>

919
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:54,870
<i>It was like a giant
petri dish, you know?</i>

920
01:07:54,872 --> 01:07:56,040
<i>Em, is that you?</i>

921
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:13,255
<i>I know that you have...</i>

922
01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:16,791
<i>a different Hawaiian shirt
for every day of the week.</i>

923
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:18,793
Emily, I can hear you.
Is that you?

924
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:20,561
<i>Though I...</i>

925
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,831
<i>Even though
I don't know you</i>

926
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,666
<i>outside of this
petri dish...</i>

927
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:25,834
<i>Emily.</i>

928
01:08:25,836 --> 01:08:28,839
But I know
that you listen to me.

929
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,909
<i>And you make me laugh.</i>

930
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,688
<i>I love you.</i>

931
01:08:45,957 --> 01:08:47,356
<i>You know?</i>

932
01:08:47,358 --> 01:08:48,458
<i>Em?</i>

933
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:52,027
<i>Emily?</i>

934
01:08:52,029 --> 01:08:53,663
<i>I needed you to know.</i>

935
01:08:54,432 --> 01:08:55,232
<i>Emily?</i>

936
01:08:57,068 --> 01:08:58,434
<i>Hey.</i>

937
01:08:58,436 --> 01:09:00,436
<i>Emily, I'm right
behind you.</i>

938
01:09:00,438 --> 01:09:01,738
<i>Hey, can you hear me?</i>

939
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:06,710
<i>Hey, Emily.</i>

940
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:10,145
- <i>Emily!</i>
- No! Please!

941
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,679
<i>Please stay back!</i>

942
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:13,315
<i>Emily, stop!</i>

943
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:20,923
<i>Emily. Hey, hey.</i>

944
01:09:20,925 --> 01:09:23,558
<i>Hey. Em? Em? Em?
Open your eyes.</i>

945
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,860
<i>Emily, open your eyes.
It's me.</i>

946
01:09:24,862 --> 01:09:26,362
<i>Hey, I got you.</i>

947
01:09:26,364 --> 01:09:27,595
- <i>I got you.</i>
- Norah, I thought you...

948
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:28,966
- You're okay.
- Norah...

949
01:09:31,035 --> 01:09:32,868
<i>Norah, I thought you...
I thought you were dead.</i>

950
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,136
<i>How's Smith? Is he okay?</i>

951
01:09:34,138 --> 01:09:35,337
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

952
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:37,006
<i>He's here. He's alive.</i>

953
01:09:37,008 --> 01:09:39,241
<i>Okay. That's what
matters, right?</i>

954
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:40,044
<i>Yes.</i>

955
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:43,613
<i>Come on, let's get up.
Come here.</i>

956
01:09:54,058 --> 01:09:57,893
<i>I didn't get very far.</i>

957
01:09:57,895 --> 01:09:59,895
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

958
01:09:59,897 --> 01:10:02,064
<i>I am so proud of you.</i>

959
01:10:02,066 --> 01:10:03,934
<i>I-I can't even
believe it, honestly.</i>

960
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:06,402
<i>Your air must be...</i>

961
01:10:06,404 --> 01:10:07,602
<i>Let me check your air,
though. You must be so...</i>

962
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:09,104
<i>No, I'm just...</i>

963
01:10:09,106 --> 01:10:09,974
<i>I figured...</i>

964
01:10:11,475 --> 01:10:12,908
<i>I'm just gonna walk.</i>

965
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:15,578
<i>Okay. That's a good plan.</i>

966
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:19,749
<i>The captain?</i>

967
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,091

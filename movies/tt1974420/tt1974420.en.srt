2
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,110
How do we know
he's not in Los Angeles?

3
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,079
We were promised,

4
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,469
as you know, the call
would come to us at 4:00.

5
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,835
It's now 10 minutes after 4:00.

6
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,576
We're waiting
here, in Los Angeles, for a phone call

7
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,670
from legendary billionaire,
Howard Hughes,

8
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,079
which could debunk...

9
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,989
We're waiting here,
in Los Angeles, for a phone call

10
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,911
from legendary billionaire,
Howard Hughes,

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,719
which could debunk a writer's
claim that he's written

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,711
an authorized autobiography
of Hughes,

13
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,439
and that Hughes is in
a permanent state of dementia.

14
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,272
The location of Howard Hughes,

15
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,430
still a complete mystery to us.

16
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,511
And if he's unable to call,

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,591
as promised
by the Hughes organization,

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,910
and prove that he is of sound mind,

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,195
well, the organization's
defense contracts,

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,759
its medical foundation,

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,991
even its casino licenses
could be in jeopardy.

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,216
If he doesn't call as promised,

23
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,576
it's gonna be hard for him
to defend himself

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,795
against the charges in Miskin's book.

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,757
Yes, wherever he's hiding.

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,976
Yes, I'm told now
that we can only wait

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,956
for Mr. Hughes' phone call until 4:30.

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,496
Very few private citizens

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,873
can be said to have developed

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,679
such an astounding amount
of influence,

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,512
celebrity and achievement.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,194
Always with
an eye out for new talent,

33
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,599
Hughes developed a reputation

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,672
for employing dozens
of young, aspiring actresses,

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,637
and keeping them under contract

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,296
...for years at RKO,

37
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,753
regardless of whether or not

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,936
they ever appear
in one of his pictures.

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,995
Hello?

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,616
Howard Hughes
was once the American ideal.

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,136
A moviemaker, an aviator,
an inventor...

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,037
Howard?

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,336
...and an industrialist,
who, at the age of 18,

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,120
inherited a fortune
which gave him a monopoly

45
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,031
on the best device in the world

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,240
with which to drill for oil.

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,536
This is
a man with relationships

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,313
with presidents,
military leaders and people who are...

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,795
Howard, you've got 18 minutes
left to place the call.

50
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,136
In 1930, he produced
the most expensive movie ever made.

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,256
Well, Miskin's book says

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,271
that Howard Hughes
cannot remember anything,

53
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,040
that he's completely
unable to communicate.

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,873
Well, despite
his countless plane crashes,

55
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,473
all of which he survived...

56
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,073
Howard, can you hear me?

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,536
His design set new speed
records in his own racing aircraft,

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,518
and he essentially
became an American hero.

59
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,909
Of course,
he's an American hero.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,479
But it's not as if

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,118
he's incapable of making a mistake.

62
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,350
He could be in the middle of making

63
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,078
a big mistake right now.

64
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,310
I think
you're mistaken, Mr. Hughes.

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,719
I think you're mistaken.

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,816
I don't
make mistakes, Colonel.

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,115
Okay,
he doesn't make mistakes.

68
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,216
The Department of Defense
has scheduled your flight...

69
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,336
The Department of Defense
didn't invent this plane, Colonel.

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,475
I did. I paid for it,

71
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
and I'll land it when
I'm goddamn ready to land it!

72
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,596
You are picking up
the Apple Blossom Queen.

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,274
Her name is Marla Mabrey.

74
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,509
Go down there, get her,

75
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,192
and drive her straight to her house.

76
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,056
Remember, any driver
who tries any hanky-panky

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,116
with a contract actress is gone.

78
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,474
He's fired.

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,314
Thank you.

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,154
Miss Mabrey, I'm Frank.
Nice to meet you.

81
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,118
Congratulations on being
the Apple Blossom Queen.

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,430
The car's just over there.
I'll get the, uh...

83
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,954
I'm Lucey, Frank. I'm Marla's mother.

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,268
Oh.

85
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,557
- Uh...
- This is Marla.

86
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,992
- Hi, I'm Frank.
- Hi.

87
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,029
Uh, this way, please.

88
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,395
Oh...

89
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,352
- Sorry, sorry.
- Okay. All right.

90
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,675
Thank you.

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,835
Let me get that for you.

92
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,319
- Thank you.
- Of course.

93
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,511
Marla's so excited
that she's actually

94
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,272
gonna finally meet Howard Hughes.

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,112
Will that be happening today?

96
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,456
That's hard for me to say, ma'am.

97
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,674
I'm new on the job.

98
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,314
I just, I got here from
Fresno two weeks ago.

99
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,594
Oh, my goodness.

100
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,358
Two weeks in Los Angeles

101
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,749
and you're working for Howard Hughes?

102
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,070
No harm
having high hopes, ma'am.

103
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
And what church do you go to, Frank,

104
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,993
if you don't mind my asking?

105
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,435
Well, it's First Methodist.
It's in Fresno.

106
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,670
Oh. All right, you're a Methodist.

107
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,671
- Right.
- I forgive you.

108
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,320
- Oh. She's kidding.
- We're Baptists.

109
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,879
Blessed savior!

110
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,235
Oh, my goodness! What a view!

111
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,031
This is very, very nice. This is...

112
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,711
Where in the world
is that coming from?

113
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,513
That's the Hollywood Bowl down there.

114
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,238
I think they're rehearsing.

115
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,029
Really?

116
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,269
$400 a week on top of this?

117
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,075
And your father never saw
$400 a week

118
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,798
even as a full professor.

119
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,474
Um, the bags are all upstairs.
The kitchen's stocked.

120
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,471
Uh, I'll be right in the...

121
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,616
Outside in the car, if you need me.

122
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,677
Do you know where the nearest
Baptist church would be?

123
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,918
I'll check on that right away, ma'am.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,274
So it just doesn't seem likely

125
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,736
that we'll meet
Mr. Hughes this afternoon?

126
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,274
We assumed we'd meet him
as soon as we arrived.

127
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,749
And where is the script
for Stella Starlight?

128
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,833
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't...

129
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,320
Any idea when I do the screen test?

130
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
I'm sorry, I really...

131
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,989
Excuse me, sorry.

132
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,196
Uh, I'll be right outside in the car

133
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,713
until your next driver comes on.

134
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,677
His name is Levar.

135
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,319
Oh, my stars!

136
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,636
Why are these chairs
so far back?

137
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,199
I'm gonna move them up.

138
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,416
President Eisenhower

139
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,760
went on to say that
the government

140
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,119
has what he termed,

141
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,476
"all sorts of useful projects
on the shelf,"

142
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
to be put into action

143
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,376
against the recession
if and when they're needed.

144
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,136
The economy of this country

145
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,878
is a lot stronger than

146
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,315
the spirit of those people
that I see...

147
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,696
"Bless us, oh, Lord,
for these, Thy gifts

148
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,016
"that we are about to receive
from thy bounty,

149
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,080
"through Christ, Our Lord.

150
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
- "Amen."
- Amen.

151
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,671
Well, from all I've read
about Howard Hughes

152
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,194
I hope he doesn't expect to
meet you in some hotel room.

153
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,388

161
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,915
Yes, I got caviar
but I still haven't met him.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,831
Do you have any idea how many houses

163
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,717
he has for actresses under contract?

164
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,032
I think something like 14.

165
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,432
More like 22.

166
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,112
More like 26.

167
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,473
- Twenty six?
- Twenty six?

168
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,639
This is how we get paid?

169
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,870
Lord in heaven!

170
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,999
Nadine, am I meeting Mr. Hughes today?

171
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,191
Sit.

172
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,198
This is an engineering problem.

173
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,594
You do know what these are?

174
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,636
Are these hulls of an aircraft?

175
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,795
What?

176
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,388
I don't know. Twin pontoons?

177
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,754
We do movies, Howard.

178
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,478
We don't know pontoons, propellers...

179
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,709
Gentlemen,

180
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,536
the way that the dress fits
around the breasts

181
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,596
makes it look like they're padded.

182
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,976
If the brassiere incorporated
some kind of point at the nipple

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
it would solve that.

184
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,593
And try not to let Miss Russell

185
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,352
hear you call them pontoons.

186
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,078
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

187
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,230
Both girls are going
away for the weekend,

188
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,912
so go now.

189
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,148
Oh, Frank, there you are.

190
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,639
Listen, you're doing swell,

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,320
and I want you to be prepared
to drive the boss any minute.

192
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,556
Well, my mom passed away.

193
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,473
Actually, I was raised
mostly by my grandma.

194
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,319
And your dad?

195
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,835
Uh...

196
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,595
Well, he, kind of, took off
before she passed away, so...

197
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,113
I think every few weeks,

198
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,416
I'll probably be able to go back

199
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,079
and see my grandma and my girl.

200
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,559
I grew up across the street from,

201
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,868
actually, my fiancée.

202
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,713
Right now she takes care
of her father's dog kennel.

203
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,110
Do you think I'll ever
get to meet Mr. Hughes?

204
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,156
So, who was it that said...

205
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,954
"They also serve
who only stand and wait"?

206
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,033
John Milton on his blindness.

207
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,234
Good for you, smart cookie.

208
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,119
You know, they say in Hollywood,

209
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,389
a girl can get in trouble

210
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,471
for having a case of the smarts.

211
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,712
Not just in Hollywood, honey.

212
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Ha-ha.

213
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,199
But if you or me make a move

214
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,136
on one of these chicks,
we are dead in the water.

215
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,878
We're history. We're fired.

216
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,034
And the Iron Maiden has emerged.

217
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,236
- The what?
- Iron Maiden.

218
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,514
The virgin Marla.

219
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,080
You did? That's horrible.

220
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,989
Stop, you.

221
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,150
What's going on?
I called you three times.

222
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,356
Please, I'm late for my 4:00.

223
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,475
What's the matter?

224
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,616
You afraid
the old man will hear

225
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,896
you were talking to a normal guy?

226
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,399
Oh, please, no.

227
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,959
Just don't, don't do this.

228
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,157
I'm not doing anything
and neither are you.

229
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,360
You're not allowed to do...

230
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,680
I'm doing just fine. Thank you.

231
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,199
You know what? Forget it.

232
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,871
What was that about?

233
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,349
Some guys never stop
looking to hide the salami.

234
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
What?

235
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,590
- What?
- Hide the salami.

236
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,309
Do the deed.

237
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,674
Dip the wick.

238
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,113
Varnish the cane.

239
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,435
Butter the muffin.

240
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,991
I get it.

241
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,269

Mam ie told me

253
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,188
one of the drivers got fired

254
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,679
because he ate dinner with her.

255

have to be hired
through their churches.

257

Fine, that doesn't make them angels.

Reverend Forbes,
do not charge the battery,

if you're not going to use the lights.

269
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,110
Unless, of course,
you'd like to be fired.

270
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,635
Anyway, the virgin Marla's a Baptist.

271
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,517
You do know why Baptists think
fucking is bad, don't you?

272
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,839
Because it might lead to dancing.

273
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,996
Knock it off, Levar.

274
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,514
♪ Ma, he's making eyes at me... ♪

275
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,272
And here's this.

276
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,679
Oh, thank you.

277
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,988

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,159

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,958
"and bless us all our days."

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,395
- Amen.
- Amen.

283
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,915
Glad you're feeling
better now, Mr. Bransford.

284
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,456
Your fiancée's been doing

285
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,198
a whale of a job
with the kennel, Frank.

286
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,400
But the puppies all tell me
they miss you around here.

287
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,628
Will the house you find us
have at least a tiny yard?

288
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,119
Absolutely.

289
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,456
And you still feel

290
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,856
Howard Hughes
is going to be interested

291
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,080
in developing
a housing project

292
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
with a kid your age?

293
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,918
When you finally meet him.

294
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,673
For all have sinned and come
short of the glory of God.

295
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,280
The Bible says that we're all sinners.

296
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,871
And the word "sin" actually means

297
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,188
that we've come short of

298
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,776
God's standards.

299
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,518
Jesus said...

300
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,776
...that we should
love the Lord God

301
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,096
with all our heart, mind, and soul

302
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,920
and our neighbors ourselves.
And I think if...

303
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,675
You think he knows?

304
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,955
Knows what?

305
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,237
You know, that you and I have...

306
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,513
...gone all the way.

307
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,399
Don't be silly.

308
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,038
Frank, why do
all you drivers slow down

309
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,439
and speed up again like that?

310
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,440
These are from
the Hughes organization.

311
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,392
Read card 4, please.

312
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,072
Read 4.

313
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,549
"When transporting
female contract players,

314
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,313
"drivers will slow
to two miles per hour

315
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,359
"at any dip, swale,
undulation or impediment

316
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,476
"that may jostle
unsupported body parts."

317
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,198
What does that mean, body parts?

318
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,429
You're kidding!

319
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,875
I haven't even met him
and he's protecting my body parts?

320
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,712
- What does it mean?
- Mom, he means my...

321
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,836
Oh, my God. That's outrageous!

322
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,680
I know. How does he know
they're unsupported?

323
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,216
- It's not amusing, Marla!
- That's what I wanna know.

324
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,309
It's funny.

325
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,576
It's not in the slightest
bit amusing.

326
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,909
To treat these women
like he owns their bodies.

327
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,056
- He doesn't own their bodies.
- To have these young girls go to class

328
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,456
in their tiny little dance outfits.

329
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,816
Uniforms, they're called uniforms.

330
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,176
Have them grabbing
for their paychecks

331
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,599
like it was bait on a hook.

332
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,800
- Which it is.
- Mom, please.

333
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,711
It's just so insulting
and disrespectful.

334
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,193
And you just watch all this

335
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,918
without saying one word,

336
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,456
- Frank, not a single word.
- What's he going to say?

337
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,696
Mrs. Mabrey, I've signed a contract

338
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,278
agreeing not to talk about Mr. Hughes.

339
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,679
Oh, have you? I can only imagine

340
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,193
what it is you won't talk about.

341
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,430
Do you realize my daughter's
never met Mr. Hughes?

342
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,629
I do, ma'am.

343
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,280
Never heard one word from him
about this screen test?

344
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,736
You know, you've saved your money.

345
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,875
You're a smart girl.

346
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,838
You can buy a lot of caviar back
in Front Royal, Virginia, my dear.

347
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,148
They don't have caviar

348
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,416
back in Front Royal,
Virginia, my dear.

349
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,896
Don't you be snippy with me,
young lady.

350
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,976
Nobody's getting any younger.

351
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,310
Mrs. Mabrey, I'd appreciate
your keeping this between us.

352
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,038
I've never met Mr. Hughes either.

353
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
- Amen.
- Amen.

354
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,231
I'll get it.

355
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Hello?

356
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,834
- Mabrey?
- Yes, Nadine.

357
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,096
Everything in the house is fine?

358
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,553
Yes, everything is fine.

359
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,936
Thank you. We would like to know,

360
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,837
when is the screen test
for Stella Starlight?

361
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,776
And where, for heaven's sake,
is Mr. Howard Hughes

362
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,976
who's never been gracious enough

363
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,468
to speak one word
to my daughter since she's been here?

364
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,516
We are not a couple
of Virginia bumpkins.

365
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,794
We've waited long enough.

366
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,871
I have nothing further to say.
Good night.

367
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,029
Marla,

368
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,475
you turned down a scholarship
to Mary Washington.

369
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,596
You haven't written a song
since you've been here,

370
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,033
and you haven't even met this man

371
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,037
who's supposedly
making your screen test.

372
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,151
His money is not enough
to buy your time.

373
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,336
Mom, he's the king of Hollywood,

374
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,016
he's one of the most
respected men in America.

375
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,120
He's some kind of a genius.

376
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,256
Everybody wants him, he's a busy man.

377
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,669
And you are a gifted young woman
with a wonderful future.

378
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,352
God forbid, in a town like this.

379
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,396
This game Howard Hughes
plays with young women,

380
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,913
it doesn't fool me one bit.

381
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,958
Nobody's getting any younger.

382
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,514
We are going home.

383
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,834
We?

384
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,869
I love you, Mom.

385
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,952
I'll help you pack.

386
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,792
The Bible tells us,

387
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,233
that whosoever
looketh on a woman

388
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,799
to lust after her,

389
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,475
hath committed adultery
with her already in his heart.

390
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,256
Someone who tells us the Bible

391
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,696
doesn't deal with sex before marriage

392
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,188
is simply trying
to avoid feeling guilty.

393
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,511
There is a time to reap
and a time to sow.

394
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,636
There is a time to embrace,

395
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,518
and a time to refrain from embracing.

396
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,993
- Hi.
- Hi.

397
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,069
How was church?

398
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,069
Miss your mom, huh?

399
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,032
Let's just go. I like driving.

400
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,591
I didn't think you knew how.

401
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,352
Ugh! I mean, I like going for a drive.

402
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,000
I know how to drive,
or I did. Let's go.

403
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,200
What do you mean "You did"?

404
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,753
My dad, God rest his soul,

405
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,136
thought women drivers
were dangerous,

406
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,469
so I quit, then I forgot how. Okay?

407
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,671
- What are you doing?
- You'll remember.

408
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,336
You've got a driver's license,
don't you?

409
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,828
Let's go. I want to show you
a place off Mulholland Drive.

410
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,835
Wait.

411
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,950
It's nice back here.

412
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,149
Hey!

413
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,915
Ooh.

414
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,790
Oh.

415
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,069
What do wanna show me?

416
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,037
It's just some acreage
I wanna develop.

417
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,553
Slow down a little bit around here.

418
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,392
It's for affordable housing.

419
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,152
Affordable housing?

420
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,696
Yeah. You know,
people who aren't rich.

421
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,392
They wanna get out of the cities,

422
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,551
and into the suburbs.

423
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,196
Just take a right, right here.
Take a right, right here?

424
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,838
Never mind.

425
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,596
The land I'm gonna show you,
the Teamsters own it.

426
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,193
They tried making it a golf course,

427
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,679
but nobody came.

428
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,752
Okay, you can slow down
a little bit more, right?

429
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,876
It's 117 acres.

430
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,080
I feel, you know,
if you make a good deal

431
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,798
on the land
and then you subdivide...

432
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,233
I don't mean big houses,

433
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,515
I mean, modest houses
for middle class families.

434
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,828
Okay, there's...

435
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,195
Cash is king right now.

436
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,599
With Howard Hughes
as a backer,

437
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,176
I mean, I know
I can make him a profit.

438
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,668
I wanna call it Mulholland Canyon.

439
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
You got a light.

440
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,279
They told me again,
"Be ready to drive the boss."

441
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,320
Wow! You might even meet the guy.

442
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,279
I should become a driver.

443
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,237
Well, I'm driving.

444
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,958
I think you're right
about this place.

445
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,629
They told me earlier,

446
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,296
class was canceled.
They didn't call you?

447
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,039
I never quite know
what's going on.

448
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,152
I had such a strange day.

449
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,873
I was outside at Schwab's,

450
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,992
and this guy
started talking to me.

451
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,999
It was nice, I mean he wasn't...

452
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,110
He wasn't making
a pass at me or anything,

453
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,350
but we talked, and he said

454
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,829
he'd like to have dinner, and I'm...

455
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,919
I'm just looking at him,

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,718
and then I realize who I'm talking to.

457
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,635
Bobby Darin.

458
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,119
I said, "I can't believe it.

459
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,428
"You're Bobby Darin."

460
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,216
I mean, okay, he didn't know
I was an actress or anything.

461
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,880
But I didn't even know
he was Bobby Darin.

462
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
It just...

463
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I...

464
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,869
I feel...

465
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,355
Old.

466
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,755
Old?

467
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,456
I mean, wouldn't you say in
Hollywood as a rule,

468
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,976
when you've been here
as long as I have

469
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,136
that you should have
already more or less

470
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
shown what you can do?

471
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,038
Let's be honest, maybe I'm not
the right girl for this,

472
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,456
I mean aren't you supposed
to have big bosoms

473
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,152
and be sexy and casual
about everything?

474
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,878
I'm a square.

475
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,552
I can't really act. I can't dance.

476
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,710
I can write songs,
but I can't really sing.

477
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,110
A movie actress should
sing songs, not write them.

478
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,713
Wouldn't you say that's true?

479
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,915
I mean, as a rule.

480
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,840
I mean, in this town,
aren't those the rules?

481
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,549
What?

482
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,040
Come on, Frank, you know the rules.

483
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,435
You're an exception.

484
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,435
The rules don't apply to you.

485
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,789
Hold on.

486
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,709
Hello?

487
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,358
Marla, hi.

488
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,079
I just wanted you to know...

489
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,230
you're meeting
with Mr. Hughes tonight.

490
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,276
I'll send someone
to pick you up right away.

491
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,035
Thank you.

492
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,915
Guess what.

493
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,556
This is the Beverly Hills Hotel?

494
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,108
We take the private entrance
to the Polo Lounge.

495
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,914
Hi!

496
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,359
Oh, thank you.

497
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,515
Oh.

498
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,079
Would you like a cocktail?

499
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Oh...

500
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,795
I don't drink.

501
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,432
- Okay, I'll be in the car.
- Oh, okay.

502
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,078
Would you follow me, Ms. Mabrey?

503
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,359
What are you talking about?

504
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,155
- It's dark in here.
- Have a seat.

505
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,231
Does he always keep it this dark?

506
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,319
Does he stay in this bungalow?

507
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,316
Sorry, I can't say.

508
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,117
Did I hear
he has five bungalows?

509
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
Hmm.

510
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,237
What's in those bottles?

511
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,593
That's water.

512
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,599
From Maine.

513
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,714
Water.

514
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,239
From Maine.

515
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,514
Is Frank still here?

516
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,839
He's, uh...

517
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,598
He's in the car.

518
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,630
You like crossword puzzles?

519
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,835
Yeah.

520
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
Yes?

521
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,949
Right away.

522
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,593
Ah! Mr. Hughes. I recognize
you from your pictures.

523
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,829
I'd like to thank you.

524
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,096
Thank you for my acting classes,

525
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,176
thank you for my ballet classes,

526
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,315
thank you for the house

527
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,456
thank you for the paycheck,

528
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,280
and thank you for the chance
to become a star.

529
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,548
Your name is, is...

530
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,832
- Marla.
- Marla.

531
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,309
- Marla Mabrey.
- Marla Mabrey. Yes.

532
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,992
Some champagne, Marla?

533
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,437
Oh, no. No, thank you, I don't drink.

534
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,996
You don't like to
have a drink?

535
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,400
No, actually I've never had one.

536
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,473
You've never had a drink?

537
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,435
No.

538
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Huh.

539
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,516
You've never had
a drink in your life?

540
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,115
No.

541
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,709
Good for you, good for you.

542
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,519
You do eat, yes?

543
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,472
I do.

544
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,318
Yes, I do eat.

545
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,473
Ah, gee.

546
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,350
This is neat.
Steak, mashed potatoes,

547
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,396
little peas.

548
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,598
Just about every single one
of my favorites.

549
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,631
Should I take mime, Mr. Hughes?

550
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,376
They say it's the visual that counts.

551
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,800
A picture's worth a thousand words.

552
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,640
And stardom's all in
how you carry your body.

553
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,712
Is it true Lana Turner took mime?

554
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,033
I guess I'm just all confused.

555
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,311
What material will I do

556
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,280
when you do my screen test
for Stella Starlight?

557
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,875
Nice.

558
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Yes.

559
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,834
That's rayon, you know,

560
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,592
the American Viscose Corporation

561
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,558
started making rayon before the war.

562
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,479
Good stuff.

563
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,235
- Hello?
- Yes?

564
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,349
Look, I want you to tell Arnold

565
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,758
that the wing flaps are not 35.4.

566
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,313
They're 36.9.

567
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,392
I have told him that
not once, but twice!

568
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,833
So take care of it!

569
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,035
Mr. Hughes,

570
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,190
I don't know if I have the talent

571
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,713
to be successful in the movies,

572
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,869
but I think I do.

573
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,056
And I'm not insulted by your
failure to meet me sooner

574
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,469
because I know you have your
own way of doing things.

575
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,471
And I may be a bumpkin from Virginia,

576
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
but I'm a good Christian.

577
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,760
And I'm smart enough to know

578
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,056
that if the rumors
I've heard about you

579
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,896
with women were true,
you wouldn't have had time

580
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,256
to fly a plane, let alone invent one

581
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,750
whether the wing flaps
were 35.4 or 36.9.

582
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,070
So I only hope I can earn
your respect for my work

583
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,549
because you've certainly
earned my respect for yours.

584
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,199
What is so funny?

585
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,033
Hey, I'm gonna get busy
on the screen test.

586
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,509
Nadine.

587
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,794
Blessed Savior!

588
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,216
Will you say hello to Nadine for me?

589
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,275
She's a treasure.

590
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,751
Nadine, I wanna get busy right away

591
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,434
on the Stella Starlight screen test

592
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,839
for Marla Mabrey, okay?

593
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,399
Good. Also, make sure

594
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,675
Harvey retouched the picture
of me in my sweater.

595
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,829
Okay.

596
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,794
Thanks, Marla.

597
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,388
Thank you!

598
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,193
So what's he really like?

599
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,016
My mom could not have been more wrong.

600
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,519
A total gentleman! Amazing!

601
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,033
I mean, yes, he's not young.

602
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,156
But the man's
an incredibly romantic figure.

603
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,456
I mean, let's face it, he's old

604
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,120
but everybody's got a crush
on him anyway.

605
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,376
I don't know if it's the money

606
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,840
or the power or the mystery or what.

607
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,719
This is silly.

608
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
What am I,

609
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,313
Mamie Eisenhower in a limousine?

610
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,113
I think maybe
it's gonna happen now, Frank.

611
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,633
I just met Howard Hughes.

612
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,633
Frank, that's 3:15 a.m.
Do you read me?

613
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,119
Roger. 3:15 a.m.

614
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,833
What's 3:15 a.m.?

615
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,474
I'm meeting him.

616
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,229
I pick him up here, 3:15 a.m.

617
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,073
It is a big day!

618
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,839
My mom could not have been
more wrong!

619
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,794
That's water.

620
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,315
From Maine.

621
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,075
Water.

622
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
From Maine.

623
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,791
How many bathrooms did
the house you grew up in have?

624
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,914
One.

625
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,514
Mine, too.

626
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,159
Keep dreaming about that house.

627
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,559
I keep knocking walls out

628
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,119
and making it bigger and bigger.

629
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,556
No, no, no. I need to know
if that son of a bitch Levar,

630
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,835
is behaving appropriately
with these girls.

631
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
And by the way,

632
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,320
I'm not sure about Wilbur either.

633
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,553
So tonight, I'm checking out
this kid Frank Forbes.

634
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,638
Did you ever think you'd be sittin' in

635
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,632
your front yard listening to
the Los Angeles Philharmonic?

636
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,917
Let's just hope nobody saw me
driving you in the front seat.

637
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,393
Frank, I really wanna
let you know

638
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,596
that when you told me
the rules don't apply to me

639
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,189
it was really helpful.

640
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Good.

641
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,108
You know, they don't
apply to you either.

642
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,394
Right.

643
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,115
Right.

644
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,989
Right.

645
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,870
I guess we better
say good night.

646
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,109
Yes.

647
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,639
Good night.

648
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,359
Hey! You've got a date at 3:15.

649
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,833
Bobby Darin's not coming by later?

650
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,356
Mr. Hughes, I'm Frank.

651
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,549
It's really an honor

652
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,200
to have the opportunity
to drive you, Mr. Hughes.

653
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,594
I didn't... I wasn't...

654
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,999
I didn't know I'd be...

655
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,833
It would happen that
I'd be driving you, but I...

656
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,757
...or that I'd be...

657
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,598
...meeting you, I mean.

658
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,559
It's a nice night.

659
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,438
Hey, do you think Levar

660
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,351
and Wilbur are the kind of guys

661
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,352
who might wanna
chippy on their wives?

662
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,237
- Chippy, sir?
- Cheat.

663
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,869
Oh! I think they're
both honest men, sir.

664
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,190
- Not old and jaded, you know?
- No.

665
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,748
Yeah, because that's one thing
I simply cannot abide

666
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,910
is a married man
who chippies on his wife.

667
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,513
I have to fire him, you know?

668
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,750
And if anybody working for me

669
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,711
wants to strike up a relationship

670
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,990
with one of
our contract actresses

671
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,433
- I have to fire him.
- Right.

672
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,272
- I just have to do that...
- Yeah.

673
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,158
They told me you're engaged to
be married to your...

674
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,496
- ...seventh grade sweetheart?
- Yes.

675
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,078
- Is that good? Yeah.
- Yes, thank you.

676
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,718
I admire that.

677
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,118
Tell me something.

678
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,112
Is... What is your thinking on Sally?

679
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,634
Or, uh...
Or Mamie, for instance?

680
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,312
Do you think
they're straight arrows?

681
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,879
- Straight arrows?
- Yeah.

682
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,428
Or the Apple Blossom Queen.
Does she play around?

683
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,589
Marla Mabrey, you mean?

684
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,194
Marla Mabrey, yeah. Is she fast?

685
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,271
- Fast?
- Fast. Promiscuous. Yeah.

686
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,635
Oh, well,
everybody who knows her says

687
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,870
she's the most devout
Christian they've ever met.

688
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,110
Really? And does she drink?

689
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,160
I'm told she's never had
a drink in her life, sir.

690
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,593
- Really?
- Yes.

691
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,756
- She go to church?
- Not far from my own.

692
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
You...

693
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,159
You go to church every Sunday?

694
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,708
- Yes, Sir. Since I was 13.
- Really?

695
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,677
You know, all these girls
want their own cars.

696
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,296
But I'm telling you,
if you don't drive them,

697
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,594
you can't keep an eye on them.

698
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,989
And it's just a, it's just a...

699
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,479
You gotta have

700
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,879
- their gate keys.
- Yes.

701
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,520
The keys to their gate,
because I'm telling you...

702
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,714
Venereal disease
in Los Angeles County's

703
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,791
- up something like 85%.
- Really?

704
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,072
Are you familiar with available land
off Mulholland Drive, sir?

705
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,755
We're very impressed
by a guy named Colton at Searle.

706
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,314
And he seems to have come up
with something for the ladies

707
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,231
called a birth control pill.

708
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,992
- Birth control?
- Birth control pill.

709
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,072
It's a contraceptive. It's Enovid.

710
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,516
If you're smart,
you'll buy yourself some Searle stock.

711
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,278
Mmm. Thank you for that tip, sir.

712
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,759
You know, Hoffmann-La Roche

713
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,637
just got a new drug
through the FDA.

714
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,915
It's an antidepressant.
They're calling it Librium.

715
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
The company's Swiss,

716
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,576
but they've got an American division

717
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,160
with a CEO by the name
of Bob Clark. He's part Irish.

718
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,316
So instead of Smith Kline,

719
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,356
or Merck, or Upjohn,
or Pfizer, or even Searle,

720
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,749
you might wanna take a look
at Hoffmann-La Roche.

721
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,398
Might be a heck of a stock.

722
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,519
Uh-huh.

723
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,868
A-ha!

724
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,116
Oh, that's nice.

725
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,554
Yeah.

726
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Hmm.

727
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,496
"For food and all Thy gifts of love,

728
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
"we give Thee thanks and praise.

729
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,216
"Look down, Oh Jesus, from up above

730
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,912
"and bless us all our days. Amen."

731
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,428
Okay, now, what did you wanna

732
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,829
- Oh!
- sell me on Mulholland Drive?

733
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
It looks to me, sir,

734
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,597
that this might be, excuse me,

735
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,628
the right time to buy
a very unique piece of land.

736
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,394
It's 117 acres. It's got everything.

737
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,797
It's located right above Mulholland...

738
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,399
Do you like to fly?

739
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,959
- Fly?
- Fly.

740
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,632
Um, no, sir.

741
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,836
- No?
- No.

742
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,315
Why?

743
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,637
Uh, I never have.

744
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,153
You never have what?

745
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,158
Flown in a plane.

746
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,151
You've never flown in a plane?

747
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,355
No.

748
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,748
Oh.

749
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,753
No, no, no, sir.

750
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,876
Sir, this one's on Frank Forbes.

751
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,712
Who's Frank Forbes?

752
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,336
I got you! I got you on that one!

753
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,536
You got me with that one, sir. Yes.

754
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,993
No, I know you, Frank.

755
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,832
I know all about you. You know that?

756
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,598
- I know all about you.
- Really?

757
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,110
- This thing, you know...
- Mm-hmm.

758
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,877
About two and a half months,
maybe three months

759
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,189
gonna be ready to test.

760
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,475
But tomorrow
we're testing a little plane.

761
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Oh, really?

762
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,238
And I want you there with me.

763
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,594
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

764
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,272
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

765
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,112
- You get it?
- Yes, sir.

766
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,111
Okay. Good.

767
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,236
You know, sometimes
I just like to come out here

768
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,512
and just sit, have a burger,
and just talk to my plane.

769
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,389
Hi, plane.

770
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,551
Say hello to my plane,
will you?

771
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
Hi, plane.

772
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,873
Plane, this is Frank.

773
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,473
And tomorrow,
we got the little plane.

774
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,630
Mr. Hughes,
you continue this flight

775
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,960
at the risk of endangering
a plane that has been paid for

776
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,036
by the government
of the United States.

777
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,953
I am trying to land
the goddamn thing!

778
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,078
Mr. Hughes,
get on your safety frequency.

779
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,269
Come in, please.

780
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,936
No safety frequency.

781
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,795
Do I...

782
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,279
A little surprise, huh?

783
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,595
It works. Yeah.

784
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,596
I feel this. Do you like it?

785
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,680
Yes, sir.

786
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,314
Don't touch that codeine.

787
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,976
- If you can get pushing...
- Don't tell me what to push!

788
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,319
I invented the goddamn thing!

789
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,758
Time for your enema, sir.

790
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,912
Give the goddamn enema bag
to Mr. Forbes, please.

791
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Yes.

792
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,438
Mr. Forbes. The enema bag.

793
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,441
You're the only person I trust
with that thing now, Frank.

794
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,232
I tell you, this dope stops you up.

795
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,514
It stops you up.

796
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,997
Buying you some of
that birth control stock.

797
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,071
It's gonna go through
the goddamn roof.

798
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,388
Frank, you know how old I was

799
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,677
when I inherited the
Hughes Tool Company from my daddy?

800
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,194
Younger than you.

801
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,599
Mr. Hughes, I don't know

802
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,920
that I'm really qualified to...

803
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,916
Oh, that's gonna be
a bad scar.

804
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,869
What do I...

805
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,753
What do I do with that?

806
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,031
I'll check on it, Mr. Forbes.

807
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,235
Lana Turner's roses
are better than mine.

808
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,433
But look at these!

809
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,874
Daisies.

810
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,430
So unexpected.

811
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,752
Jean Peters is smart.

812
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,390
Mr. Forbes, Nadine is on the phone.

813
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,356
Where I come from,
daisies are cheap.

814
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,994
- Yeah?
- Frank, it's about...

815
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,274
Yes, hello, Nadine.

816
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,640
I've been on duty
at the hospital

817
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,948
a hundred percent of my time.

818
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,256
It's a little difficult
for me to count

819
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,640
how many gallons of gas
that I used

820
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,080
before Mr. Hughes
had his accident.

821
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,874
Thank you.

822
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
You've moved up.

823
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,509
Mr. Forbes.

824
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,994
It's been a while.

825
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,715
They need you.

826
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,628
Okay. Uh...

827
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,315
Bobby Darin's
not sending you daisies?

828
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,399
Okay, fine. I get it.

829
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,118
I have to still
sit in the back seat.

830
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,320
But if we're going to lunch,

831
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,680
do we eat at the same table,
or...

832
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,672
No. I'm eating in the kitchen,
of course.

833
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,631
I think, you know what?

834
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,154
Why don't you just drive?
I should sit in the back seat.

835
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,753
I don't know why I'm,
you know...

836
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,118
I guess nobody can say
we don't follow the rules.

837
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,896
"For food
and all Thy gifts of love,

838
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,194
"we give Thee thanks
and praise.

839
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,633
"Look down, Oh Jesus,

840
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,597
"from above and bless us all
our days. Amen."

841
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,750
Amen. I can't believe it.

842
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,936
He's finally out of the hospital,

843
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,439
and right away
you fly to Washington?

844
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,999
You're gonna miss my screen test.

845
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,318
I heard Eisenhower sent him
a telegram.

846
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,576
If Eisenhower
was really smart,

847
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,114
he'd have Howard Hughes
just bomb Moscow,

848
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,576
and have communism over
and done with.

849
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,716
I think Howard Hughes
should be president.

850
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,640
There's nobody like him.
He's on another level.

851
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Seriously, the poor man,

852
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,136
he's gotta deal with these
TWA stockholders

853
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,176
who are crabbing about moving
from propellers to jets.

854
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,394
At the same time,

855
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,016
he now has to convince
the United States Senate

856
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,439
that the Hercules can fly.

857
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,120
So you're gonna fly to Washington?

858
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,549
I will not be flying.
Thank you for asking. I will be taking

859
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,696
the train early in the morning.

860
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,278
When does Sarah move to LA?

861
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,190
Um, well, I...

862
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,193
Don't know if Sarah and I are...

863
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,159
She still believes that
once you've been intimate

864
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,719
or gone all the way
with a person,

865
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,791
that in the eyes of God

866
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,632
you're committed to that person

867
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,233
for the rest of your life.

868
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,675
So she believes
since you and she have...

869
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,315
...gone all the way,
that you're already married?

870
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,674
I agree with Sarah.

871
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,873
That's why I've never done it.

872
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,713
That's why I'm waiting,
because I have to be sure.

873
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,752
Well that's, I mean,
that's a little...

874
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,592
I'm not legally married.

875
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,750
Senator,
I have come here to testify

876
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,592
of my own free will.

877
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,309
Senator, I have come here to
testify of my own free will.

878
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,833
Wait. Senator,

879
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,475
I have come here to testify
of my own free will.

880
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,832
Senator, I have come here to
testify of my own free will.

881
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,639
Any word on
the possibility of me...

882
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,473
...getting a ticker tape parade?

883
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,197
They don't have ticker tape
parades in Washington, Howard.

884
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,835
There are no skyscrapers here.

885
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,316
Do you think I don't know
what you're planning?

886
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,400
What I'm planning?

887
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,675
What you're planning.
You think I'm nuts, right?

888
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,040
You think I'm nuts.

889
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,599
Howard, all I said was,

890
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,432
I think you should see someone.

891
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,078
"See someone?"

892
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,230
I really think you need help, kid.

893
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,992
See someone?

894
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,559
What are you talking about?

895
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,756
Do you realize
that I'm trying to move

896
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,274
an entire airline
from propellers to jets?

897
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,032
And the stockholders could hear

898
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,759
that I am sitting in a loony bin

899
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,910
locked up with some psychiatrist

900
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,911
who can declare me
to be incompetent

901
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,468
and then I have to give
the whole goddamn business

902
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,154
over to some
goddamn conservator?

903
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,668
You do realize that?

904
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,396
I'll be in my room, Howard.

905
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,319
What are you looking at?

906
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,398
You got any ideas?
Speak up.

907
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,376
I think you represent
to the majority of this committee,

908
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,710
what is great about capitalism
as opposed to communism.

909
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,518
I think these people
are scared of you,

910
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,953
and I think they wanna be you.

911
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,496
I don't think
you have to practice

912
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,736
what you're gonna
say like this.

913
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,988
I think you can go in there,

914
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,149
and try not even knowing

915
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,736
what you're gonna say
until you say it.

916
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,957
And you're not, in my opinion,
gonna say the wrong thing.

917
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,195
Huh.

918
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,714
You know...

919
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,673
You know how old I was
when I took over my daddy's company?

920
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,839
I was younger than you.

921
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,154
Did I tell you that?

922
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,673
Roll film.

923
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,713
Okay. Darling, relax.

924
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,513
Tell us a little about yourself.

925
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,951
Okay. I'm from
Front Royal, Virginia.

926
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,357
I've always been interested
in speech and dramatics.

927
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,512
- I write songs.
- Turn to your left.

928
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,638
Can you raise
your chin up a little?

929
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,551
Great.
Keep talking.

930
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,354
I was going to go
to Mary Washington College,

931
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,590
where I intended
to major in English.

932
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,113
Okay, can you turn
to your right?

933
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,033
But keep talking, and chin up.
Major in English, go on.

934
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,269
Um...

935
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,272
But I decided
when I won a talent contest

936
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,112
that maybe I'd give it a go
in Hollywood.

937
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,758
Okay, can you turn
to your right?

938
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,672
Great, great, great. Okay.

939
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,153
Do you sing?

940
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,232
Well, sort of.

941
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,514
Should I keep talking?

942
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,914
Okay, turn to your left.

943
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,993
Do you swim?

944
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,115
Sure!

945
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,191
Wardrobe,
do we have any bathing suits?

946
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,079
If you ever wanted
to slip out for a bite or something,

947
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,594
I think we could do
that under the radar.

948
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,576
Mr. Hughes,

949
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,160
the American people
wanna know if someone

950
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,038
is making a profit
on a plane that can't fly!

951
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,348
Senator...

952
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,558
I have come here to testify
of my own free will.

953
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,112
Nobody's making any profit.

954
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,399
This plane will be used
for testing and research

955
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,836
and advancing the art of
aviation in this country.

956
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,876
In a few more days, it'll fly.

957
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,076
I have stated that
if it were to be a failure,

958
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,435
I would leave this country
and never come back.

959
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,520
And I mean it!

960
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,158
It'll fly, Senator.

961
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,395
It'll fly.

962
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,755
Howard Hughes's
giant plane has flown.

963
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,798
And at the controls, the successful
designer, builder, owner,

964
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,314
airspeed record holder,
multimillionaire himself,

965
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,435
Howard Hughes.

966
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,750
Bravo!

967
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,035
Billionaire, goddamn it,
not millionaire.

968
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,056
And what the hell happened
to the close-up of me

969
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,115
in the cockpit? You know,

970
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,792
the plane flew
for one mile,

971
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,871
and nobody knows
if it'll ever fly again.

972
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,111
And they know what it cost.
That does me no good

973
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,031
at TWA. All right,
thank you, gentlemen.

974
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,076
Thank you very much. Greg?

975
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,840
Yes, Howard?

976
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,749
Howard?

977
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,635
Howard?

978
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,176
I gotta know
what legal steps I gotta take

979
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,760
to keep these people
from sticking me with a psychiatrist,

980
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,035
and then committing me
to an insane asylum...

981
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,678
Then declaring me
to be incompetent,

982
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,672
and then turning over
my entire business to a conservator.

983
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,716
You gotta tell me
what I have to do...

984
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,916
To legally keep them
from doing that, okay?

985
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,439
Call me back.

986
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,278
Hello?

987
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,476
Hello, ma'am.

988
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,675
I was informed that

989
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,836
your television antenna
was defective.

990
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,831
I brought over
the newest model.

991
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,071
And I was wondering
if you would...

992
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,999
I just saw your screen test.
You were great.

993
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,633
It was great!

994
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,228
Really?

995
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,878
Well...
I thought it was pretty awful!

996
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,234
You were great.

997
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,750
They just wanted to see me
in a bathing suit!

998
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,955
I didn't do it.

999
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,831
But they didn't say anything
when it was over.

1000
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,188
You've got something
these guys

1001
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,952
don't even know about yet.

1002
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,600
I mean, wait till
Howard Hughes sees it.

1003
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,229
I have two more of these
in the car, just in case.

1004
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,955
Daisies.

1005
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,149
And not from Jean Peters?

1006
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,160
Well, they could be.
They could be from anybody.

1007
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,038
They just, according to the rules,
can't be from me.

1008
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,638

It's Levar.

1035
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,832
- What?
- He's driving me to class.

1036
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,629
This is my fault.

1037
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,856
This is all my fault.
This is my fault.

1038
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,976
No, no.
This is not your fault.

1039
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,831
This is all my fault.
This is my fault.

1040
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,791
And it's fine.
Let's face it, it's fine.

1041
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920
I sang you the song.

1042
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,096
This is my fault.

1043
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,120
This is all my fault.

1044
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,195
There's a broom and a dustpan
in there, okay?

1045
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,710
Wait, tell Levar
I brought the antenna. Okay.

1046
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
Hi, come on in.

1047
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,155
Hi.

1048
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,616
Oh, Frank and I were trying
to make space

1049
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,835
- for the TV and...
- Wow.

1050
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,433
- Let me help you with that.
- Thanks!

1051
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,192
Sure.

1052
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,635
Wait. What, what time is it?
We're gonna be late for class.

1053
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,790
Oh, no,
you're not going to class.

1054
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,518
Mr. Hughes wants to see you.

1055
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,600
Now?

1056
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,352
Yeah, yeah,
I thought they called you.

1057
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,558
I'm supposed
to take you over there.

1058
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,788
Hey, Levar.

1059
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,880
Hi, Frank.

1060
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,315
They sent me over
with the new antenna.

1061
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,469
It didn't work though.

1062
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,073
We were trying to move the TV.

1063
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,576
- I'll do that. I'll do it.
- No, no, no.

1064
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,296
I'll do that, I'll do that.
Yeah, be careful of your feet.

1065
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,816
I'll get the other
antennas from the car.

1066
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,520
No! I'll do that! Because I know
that you're late. So I'll get them.

1067
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,795
Boy.

1068
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,108
I'm, uh...

1069
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,359
I'm gonna get some towels.

1070
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,990
I just don't know how this
stands with the church.

1071
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,336
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go to Fresno.

1072
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,080
- I'm gonna talk to Sarah.
- You're married!

1073
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,189
You're a married man!

1074
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,776
- I'm gonna be honest with her.
- I know that!

1075
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,896
- I have been with her since...
- You're right.

1076
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,136
...we were in
the seventh grade together.

1077
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,576
What's been happening with us
is not your fault.

1078
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,776
But I've behaved
like a cheap floozy.

1079
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,096
You're not hearing
what I'm saying.

1080
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,216
I'm not some disgusting
tease of a virgin...

1081
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,416
- You've done nothing wrong!
- ...trying to steal

1082
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,656
another woman's husband.
Are you listening to me?

1083
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,590
You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

1084
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,736
I am not trying to steal
another woman's husband.

1085
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,936
- You've done nothing wrong.
- You're not an adulterer.

1086
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,995
You're married, Frank.

1087
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,433
- You're not...
- You're...

1088
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,555
Need help?

1089
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,359
No, thanks, Levar. I'm just gonna
change my clothes. Thanks, Frank.

1090
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,634
See you later.

1091
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,268
I hired you as my double
because you look exactly like me.

1092
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,191
The shoes are all wrong.
Now, get out of here.

1093
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,436
They'll be more
exacting next time, sir.

1094
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,311
Okay. That, that
you cannot legally

1095
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,755
commit a person
to an insane asylum

1096
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,718
if they are married and their spouse
refuses to commit to it?

1097
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,279
- Yes, sir.
- Uh-huh.

1098
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,430
Well, what if there is no spouse?

1099
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,358
Greg, I got 30,000 people
working for me

1100
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,398
on weapons the Pentagon
would trust nobody else to do,

1101
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,072
and you're telling me go out

1102
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,071
and get a wife to stay out
of the loony bin?

1103
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,196
After your meeting,
what would you think about

1104
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,397
sneaking out
some place totally private?

1105
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,278
Yes, ring
Mr. Brian Forester, please.

1106
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,114
Brian Forester.

1107
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,315
This is Howard Hughes.

1108
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,509
Hello, Mr. Hughes.

1109
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,798
We've traveled a long way, sir,
to discuss TWA. We were just hoping

1110
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,269
we could skip over
and say a quick hello.

1111
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,237
We're in the same hotel,
after all.

1112
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,958
You could just be
a few feet away!

1113
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,678
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Forester.

1114
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,034
I will talk to you later.

1115
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,516
Hi. Want some ice cream?

1116
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,113
No, thank you.

1117
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,877
Bit on top.
Yes, yes. That's good.

1118
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,473
- The young lady is here, Mr. Hughes.
- Oh.

1119
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,710
Also, Mr. Forester,
the Merrill Lynch man,

1120
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,074
- called again.
- Uh-huh.

1121
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,151
They're in bungalow 8-A.

1122
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,918
They wanna know
which bungalow you're in.

1123
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Uh-huh.

1124
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,149
They wanna see you.

1125
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,113
There's no need for anyone
to know what bungalow I'm in.

1126
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,912
Yeah, just give me...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1127
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,709
Good, good, good. Okay.
And, you can take...

1128
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,120
Be careful.

1129
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,272
Yeah, because...

1130
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,475
You, uh...

1131
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,079
Uh-huh.

1132
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,159
Yeah, yeah. That's good.

1133
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,990
And a little bit more over.
That's good.

1134
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,149
Hey. Hey.

1135
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,470
Argh! Get that person
outta here!

1136
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,031
Let's find your mommy
and daddy.

1137
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,456
So are we finished
with this haircut or not?

1138
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,869
How should I know?
He's very exacting.

1139
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,598
Exacting's not even
the word for that.

1140
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,477
I don't look like him!

1141
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,798
So now you're telling me

1142
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,393
to just go get married
to somebody

1143
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,277
who's nice enough to keep people

1144
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,351
from putting me into an insane asylum?

1145
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,317
Also, I'm running outta codeine.

1146
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,680
Sarah, we should take
a little bit of time.

1147
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,638
We need to take time
to think.

1148
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,239
Well, hello.

1149
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,075
What did you say?

1150
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,752
I said hello!

1151
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,400
Mm-hmm.

1152
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,596
It's been a while, Mr. Hughes.

1153
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,159
Huh?

1154
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,360
It's been a while
since we met.

1155
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,396
I have a telephone message
from Mr. Forester.

1156
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,515
Read it.

1157
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,511
"We came at your request to lend you

1158
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,398
- "$400 million for TWA.
- Mm-hmm.

1159
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,516
"Shouldn't we at least
be allowed to meet you,

1160
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,636
"as the person who controls TWA,

1161
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,760
"face-to-face?"

1162
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,319
What was his tone?

1163
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,799
- Nervous.
- Service?

1164
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,035
Nervous!

1165
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,076
Ah, yeah.
Well, okay, thank you.

1166
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,593
Yeah, it has been

1167
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,758
a while since we were able
to see one another, Marla.

1168
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,070
I do see your name
on my check every week.

1169
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,636
That's sort of like
seeing you.

1170
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,869
Would you excuse me?

1171
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,274
Shut the door.

1172
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,633
What the hell
is she doin' here?

1173
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,597
You said you wanted the girl
with the two M's.

1174
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,989
That's not her.
That's Marla Mabrey.

1175
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,638
She's a Baptist nun,
for Christ's sake.

1176
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,915
That's the only one
on the payroll with two M's.

1177
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,911
Did it occur to you
that maybe the one

1178
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,833
that I wanted with the two M's
was not on the payroll?

1179
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,631
Ah! You meant Marilyn Monroe?

1180
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,914
Who?

1181
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,308
Marilyn Monroe? Her?

1182
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,992
Yes! Marilyn Monroe!

1183
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,756
I'll get rid of her at once.
I apologize, sir.

1184
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,920
- Marilyn. I'll get Marilyn.
- No. Hey, wait, wait...

1185
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,360
I'll get rid of her.
You go on home.

1186
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,274
How's your mother?

1187
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,510
She's very well.

1188
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,113
Uh-huh.

1189
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,079
Bankers.

1190
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,277
Big boys from New York.

1191
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,555
From what I read,

1192
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,154
bankers work in extremely
conventional ways.

1193
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,075
I don't pretend to understand
the airline business,

1194
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,673
but I'm told you say propellers

1195
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,671
are a thing of the past.

1196
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,576
Well, I think your mother
probably thought I was okay

1197
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,431
as long as she was sure that

1198
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,000
we had nothin' to do with each other.

1199
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,376
I think she thought that if I had been

1200
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,833
just one of those girls

1201
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,354
you wouldn't have real respect
for my integrity.

1202
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,032
Ah.

1203
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,439
I mean, I guess a girl's always

1204
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,118
got a reputation to think about.

1205
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,272
Well, I guess a man always

1206
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,112
has a reputation to think about.

1207
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,278
- Uh...
- Hello?

1208
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,360
Mr. Forester?

1209
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,919
Mr. Hughes?

1210
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,434
Listen, I don't think
there's any real

1211
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,158
necessity for us to meet.

1212
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,629
I mean, there's no reason
why we can't do this

1213
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,630
on the telephone.

1214
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,597
Well, let me be plain, sir.

1215
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,355
I am not authorized to approve
our venture to lend you

1216
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:36,149
$400 million unless we meet.

1217
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,354
Mr. Hughes?

1218
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,189
Mr. Hughes?

1219
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,472
If there's a Stella Starlight script,

1220
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,828
you could have fooled me.

1221
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,752
Did you look at my screen test?

1222
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,273
Mr. Hughes, please just

1223
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,656
tell us what bungalow you're in.

1224
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,079
It would be so very easy.

1225
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,835
We're, we're 14 feet away.
Five feet away? Twenty feet away?

1226
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,831
Which one is your bungalow?
We'll come to you!

1227
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,273
Uh, Mr. Forester...

1228
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,669
I'm sorry, I don't think there's any

1229
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,876
need for us to actually meet.

1230
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,151
There's no reason why we shouldn't

1231
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,117
be able to do this on the telephone.

1232
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,280
Mr. Hughes?

1233
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,560
Mr. Hughes?

1234
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,555
These guys wanna have
a face-to-face meeting with me,

1235
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,074
and then be able to say I'm crazy.

1236
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,878
And then I'll have to give up control

1237
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,032
of TWA to them. It's just...

1238
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,678
Well, maybe you'd teach them a lesson

1239
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,273
if you just gave it to them.

1240
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,056
Then they could sue me
for a whole lot of money,

1241
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,960
and then they may come after
my daddy's company,

1242
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,032
and so I really
can't afford to let them

1243
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,917
make me some kind
of a psychiatric case.

1244
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,355
I would leave this country
and never come back.

1245
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,036
I'd leave this country,
and never come back.

1246
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,434
You know?

1247
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,476
I'd leave this country,
and never come back.

1248
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,760
I'd leave this country,
and never come back.

1249
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,472
What, I'm not gonna do it.

1250
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,256
They just have a face-to-face
meeting with me,

1251
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,429
and then call me a nut?

1252
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,112
Well, that's ridiculous!

1253
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,589
And you have all your
own people around you

1254
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,438
who you know you can trust.

1255
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,595
May I give you some advice?

1256
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,908
Yes.

1257
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,470
Never trust anybody.

1258
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,992
Not me, not anybody.

1259
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,593
They're not your mommy
or your daddy.

1260
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,989
The only person
you can trust is you.

1261
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,153
Do you have children?

1262
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,350
Me?

1263
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,634
- No?
- No.

1264
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:29,396
I'm afraid that I'm still
more of a son than a father.

1265
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,391
But I'll tell you somethin'
very important,

1266
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,152
that a couple of limeys
came up with

1267
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,639
three or four years ago.

1268
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,269
Little thing called DNA,

1269
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,158
and we're workin' with it
over at my foundation.

1270
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,196
In a sense,
you are your father,

1271
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,033
because his DNA
is still inside of you.

1272
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,314
It keeps goin' on,

1273
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,016
and your father had nothing
to say about it.

1274
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,792
That's what makes him
still alive.

1275
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,792
DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid.

1276
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,871
It's got all the genetic
instructions

1277
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,872
that cause all of the function
and development of all

1278
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,918
known living organisms.
It's the basic,

1279
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,070
hereditary material
in human beings,

1280
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,674
and it's gonna replicate,
and replicate, and replicate,

1281
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,512
whether we want it to or not.

1282
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,717
You have no choice.
It's just gonna keep going.

1283
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,279
It's gonna keep you alive.

1284
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,957
What if Stella Starlight sang?

1285
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,118
You know, make the movie a musical.

1286
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,513
I can sing!

1287
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,757
Well, but nobody should have children

1288
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,308
if they don't want to.
That's for sure.

1289
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,711
Yeah. Well, anyway,

1290
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,554
if I lost my daddy's company,
it'd be like losing my daddy.

1291
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,278
Those finance people are jackals.

1292
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,480
Jackals?

1293
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,600
Jackals.

1294
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,068
Why should you meet with them?

1295
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,517
And so what
if you repeat yourself a lot?

1296
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,430
It adds emphasis.

1297
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,875
Emphasis?

1298
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,079
Have you heard from people
that I'm crazy?

1299
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,197
Well, if what you are
is crazy, then,

1300
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,194
then give me more crazy!

1301
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,191
You're not crazy.
You're just...

1302
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:02,956
Smart.

1303
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,474
You are not like other people.

1304
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,589
You're an exception.

1305
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,589
Hello?

1306
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,473
- Mr. Hughes?
- Um...

1307
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,269
I am not going to be able
to talk to you until later.

1308
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,515
What is later?

1309
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,999
Thank you. Thank you.

1310
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Mr. Hughes?

1311
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,318

a little song I wrote?

1312

You make an old guy courageous, Marla.

1331
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,352
Is that a compliment, Howard?

1332
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,113
You're not calling me Mr. Hughes.

1333
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,193
Makes me feel so much younger.

1334
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,077
Good, Howard!

1335
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,272
Now, how would you like
to forget about

1336
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,954
bringing the entire
American aerospace industry

1337
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,798
into the inevitable future

1338
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,350
and drive to Palm Springs
in a car?

1339
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,793
They say it's like heaven.

1340
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,638
If I had a car, I'd drive you there.

1341
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,233
All you girls should have cars.

1342
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,710
And we should tear up
your term contract

1343
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,995
and just make it a picture
a year for three years.

1344
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,435
$100,000 a picture, okay?

1345
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,437
It doesn't seem real to me.

1346
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,753
That's what's real.

1347
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,193
You think it's crazy to trust
your gut instinct?

1348
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,271
"There is a tide
in the affairs of men,

1349
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,590
"which taken at the flood
lead on to fortune.

1350
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,758
"Omitted, all the voyage of their life

1351
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,836
"is bound in shallows
and in miseries."

1352
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,920
Yes.

1353
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,280
"There is a time for everything.

1354
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,271
"A time to reap and a time to sow.

1355
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,280
"A time to abstain from embracing,

1356
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:40,231
"and there is a time to embrace."

1357
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,397
We don't need a justice of the peace.

1358
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,951
With this ring, I thee wed.

1359
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,909
Wait.

1360
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,078
Careful.

1361
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,629
Yeah.

1362
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,119
Yeah. That's it.

1363
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,989
What do you mean
we need time to think?

1364
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,036
I just, I mean that...

1365
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,840
We've been thinking
since the seventh grade.

1366
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,000
I only mean that we should
take a little bit of time.

1367
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,990
You know, we're not
in the seventh grade anymore.

1368
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,070
I'm just saying it's probably...

1369
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,476
You mean you need
time to think.

1370
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,515
Get me Greg.

1371
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,109
Yes, Howard?

1372
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,269
- Greg?
- Yes?

1373
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,839
I've changed my mind. Get the plane.

1374
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,313
I'm going to Vegas in one hour.

1375
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,674
Howard, no air...

1376
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,154
Mr. Hughes,
do you want my money?

1377
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,072
Do you want my money?

1378
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,438
Do you want my money or not?

1379
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,234
The hell with TWA,
you son of a bitch!

1380
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,439
We're flying American Airlines
back to New York!

1381
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,599
- Hi.
- Hi.

1382
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,999
Wow!

1383
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,193
This is great!

1384
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,952
They're giving all the girls cars.

1385
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,076
They told me at headquarters.

1386
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,388
But I can't make mine start.

1387
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,152
- Really?
- No.

1388
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,037
Do you want me to...

1389
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Um...

1390
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,875
- It's probably flooded.
- Flooded?

1391
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,798
Yeah. It's flooded.

1392
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,431
Um, you have to
wait a little.

1393
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,159
Did somebody give that to you?

1394
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,188
Who gave that to you?

1395
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,229
You're a married man, Frank.

1396
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,351
- I...
- Who gave that to you?

1397
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,476
I can't do this
with you anymore.

1398
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,039
I'm seeing someone.

1399
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,549
It's private.

1400
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,073
I'm not gonna
discuss it with you.

1401
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,120
- Hello?
- Hello?

1402
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,349
- Nadine!
- Yes?

1403
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,509
Hi, it's Marla.

1404
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,669
Marla, hi.

1405
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,069
Would you please ask
Mr. Hughes to call me back?

1406
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,718
I'm sorry, Marla.
All I can say is

1407
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,990
he's gonna be out
of town for a month.

1408
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,672
Possibly five weeks.

1409
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,552
Anything I can help with?

1410
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,312
Well, could you tell
him I've decided

1411
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,152
against the agreement
we discussed?

1412
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,232
I can't do it.
I just can't do it.

1413
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,238
I'll give him your message.

1414
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,639
Okay. Thank you.

1415
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,152
I used to have a life.

1416
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:42,559
Walter O'Malley,

1417
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,816
the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers

1418
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,479
has announced the team will
be moving to Los Angeles.

1419
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,674
Also, a bulletin just in
about Howard Hughes.

1420
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,877
Howard Hughes just
announced he's married.

1421
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,030
And wouldn't you know,
he married an actress.

1422
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,872
The new Mrs. Hughes is

1423
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,757
Hollywood actress, Jean Peters.

1424
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,673
In other news,
Premier Khrushchev told the United...

1425
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,113
Oh, my God.

1426
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,675
Jean Peters hit the jackpot!

1427
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,216
Sally told me
he was moving to Las Vegas

1428
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,753
for a while, but not to get married.

1429
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:11,976
And meanwhile, he's out of town,

1430
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,433
and he's got poor Frank and Levar

1431
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,272
cooped up in the studio
all day and night.

1432
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,912
I'm gonna go down to RKO tomorrow

1433
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,416
and tell Levar why you can't believe

1434
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,351
anything Howard Hughes ever says.

1435
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,153
I've had it with Howard Hughes.

1436
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,800
Mamie, I forgot something.
I'll catch up with you later.

1437
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,716
Hey, Mamie.

1438
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,360
Hello, gentlemen.

1439
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,256
I don't want anybody knowing
I'm not in Las Vegas.

1440
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,350
They cannot know I'm in Los Angeles.

1441
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,112
We got some things to catch up on.

1442
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,191
Just tell what's his name,

1443
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,998
to walk over to the White House

1444
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:55,278
and loan the vice president's
brother $205,000.

1445
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,396
Read me back the last page of my memo

1446
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,118
on my wife's missing cat.

1447
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,474
Yes, Mr. Hughes.

1448
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,512
"I have been in Las Vegas
for 37 hours now.

1449
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,556
"I have been told there has not been

1450
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,278
"one iota of progress

1451
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,591
"in Los Angeles in the search
for my wife's missing cat.

1452
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,876
"I want somebody who is an expert

1453
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,837
"in the ways of animals of this type.

1454
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,593
"Los Angeles is not the jungle.

1455
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,592
"It is not the Everglades.
It is not New York City

1456
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,318
"with the dense population.

1457
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,834
"If a zoo had lost some
valuable animal

1458
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,558
"in the Los Angeles area,

1459
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,313
"there would have been
25 or 30 men

1460
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,231
"scouring the countryside,

1461
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,438
"men skilled in the habits and
ways of an animal of this kind

1462
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,317
"and would have found it by now."

1463
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,073
"I feel that there is
absolutely no reason why

1464
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,913
"a search should not
have been instigated

1465
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,195
"for this animal, equal in any way

1466
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:48,872
"to what would have happened

1467
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,509
"if some damned train
had broken down here

1468
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,912
"and some leopard or panther
or whatnot had escaped.

1469
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,357
"There is absolutely no reason
why a man of my resources

1470
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,479
"and having the resources and
organization that I have got,

1471
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,869
"there is no goddamned
reason in the world."

1472
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,277
"There are many, many, many things

1473
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,759
"that could have been done

1474
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,956

"I hope you will read

1477

1478
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,230
"more sincerely than I mean this.

1479
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,591
"Signed, Howard R. Hughes."

1480
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,399
It's 26 pages long, Mr. Hughes.

1481
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,629
We have four carbon copies.

1482
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,270
Hello?

1483
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,839
Howard, I'm here.

1484
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,599
- You wanted to see me.
- I'm married now, Noah.

1485
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,875
Do you still think
I need to be seen

1486
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,155
by these TWA people?

1487
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,416
Well, you're going to have to let them

1488
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,032
look at you eventually, Howard.

1489
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,120
Admit it, Noah.

1490
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,760
You can't legally commit me
to an insane asylum,

1491
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,273
because I have married a woman

1492
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,952
that I have known
and trusted for years,

1493
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:08,950
and you know very well

1494
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,917
that she would never
give her consent to it.

1495
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,793
I love you, Noah,
but you're not my father.

1496
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,074
You're fired.

1497
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,310
You've been replaced.

1498
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,238
He's lucky to have you, Frank.

1499
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,680
Good luck, son.

1500
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,960
Don't let him start to think
you're trying to be his father.

1501
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,430
The vice president's
brother is apparently

1502
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,351
not in Washington, D.C., this week.

1503
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,839
We think he's in Miami.

1504
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,150
And he will supposedly...

1505
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,593
His secretary said he'll be back

1506
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,716
sometime in the middle

1507
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,153
or end of next week.

1508
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,376
So if we need to get in touch
with him or send him anything,

1509
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,436
we can do it sometime
towards the middle...

1510
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,272
- Frank, Frank, Frank.
- Yes, Mr. Hughes?

1511
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,590
Does he know I'm back in Los Angeles?

1512
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,438
I don't wanna have to call him again.

1513
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,239
I want banana nut ice cream.

1514
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,835
Hey. Excuse me.

1515
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,154
What are you doing?

1516
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:40,990
What's going on?

1517
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,776
- Stella Starlight!
- What are you talking about?

1518
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,995
Stella Starlight is a really,
really stupid title

1519
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,479
for a really stupid movie.

1520
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,840
But not nearly as stupid as I am

1521
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,896
- for thinking he'd ever make it.
- What are you talking about?

1522
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,309
First, he gives me a lot of
junk about how great I am.

1523
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,856
And now I can't get him on the phone.

1524
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,474
He hasn't even bothered to
look at my stupid screen test!

1525
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,096
- Wait a minute.
- Wait a minute for what?

1526
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,400
- Wait a minute.
- Howard Hughes?

1527
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,839
Is that who you're waiting for?

1528
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:03,798
I think you should take some time.

1529
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,791
And maybe don't try
to advise me on my career.

1530
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,136
How could I advise you
on your career?

1531
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,200
I have no idea what's
going on in your life or where

1532
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,256
you're getting your advice
from. And I'm not asking.

1533
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,554
I'm not asking about your ring.

1534
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,675
I'm not asking...

1535
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:21,436
Reverend Forbes, banana nut.

1536
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,310
You know, I don't know
if I still got a shot at her.

1537
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,118
But if anybody does, trust me,

1538
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,776
it's the Reverend Frank Forbes
of Fresno.

1539
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:28,800
Stop.

1540
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,717
Mr. Hughes, I think maybe
now is a good time

1541
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,736
to deal with the acreage
that I spoke to you about

1542
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,069
the canyon off Mulholland Drive.
I've got a plan.

1543
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,390
The time for suburban
development has come.

1544
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,277
Its time has come... And, and...

1545
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,396
Mulholland Canyon is gonna be gold.

1546
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,708
And you know what Victor Hugo

1547
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,256
once said?
"There's nothing so powerful

1548
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,952
"as an idea whose time

1549
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,473
"has come."

1550
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,696
I would like to just drive you

1551
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,936
- out there tomorrow and show you.
- Howard, it's Bob Maheu.

1552
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,428
On my first day as your new CEO,

1553
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,656
I must tell you that if you don't

1554
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,079
let these people from TWA see you,

1555
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:07,391
they can make you be
seen by them in court.

1556
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,913
Bob. Bob, Bob.

1557
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,912
Nobody makes me be seen anywhere.

1558
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,558
You got that?

1559
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,596
However, I am...

1560
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,513
I am making you be seen tonight

1561
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,478
in Las Vegas, Nevada,
with our entire staff.

1562
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,949
We're all gonna be there,
we're all flyin' in tonight.

1563
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,235
We're moving to Nevada.
You wanna know why?

1564
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,675
Because I am selling TWA.

1565
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,835
Selling TWA?

1566
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,514
There's no state tax in Nevada, Frank.

1567
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,675
Howard?

1568
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,696
And if you're still
afraid of flyin'...

1569
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,720
Howard?

1570
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,336
...you know, you better
get in the car soon,

1571
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,635
because it's a three hour
and 47 minute drive.

1572
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,720
Howard?

1573
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,240
Is that banana nut?

1574
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,115
Uh...

1575
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,553
Banana nut, sir. Yeah.

01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,040
Mr. President,

1581
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,433
I know how well you understand

1582
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,954
that there is no one who
has done more than I have

1583
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,519
to rid Hollywood of communists.

1584
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,909
And please allow me
to clarify, once more,

1585
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,036
the extreme danger all Americans

1586
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,271
will face in living
anywhere near a nuclear test site.

1587
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,351
Sincerely, Howard R. Hughes.

1588
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,392
Elvis Presley, Pat Boone,
Frankie Avalon, Bobby Darin.

1589
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,616
I mean, what do you think a guy
like Bobby Darin makes on something

1590
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,675
like "Beyond The Sea"?

1591
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,136
Frank, how's it going on

1592
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,559
the banana nut ice cream front?

1593
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,790
The company's definitely
not making it anymore.

1594
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,518
But the good news is we located

1595
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,591
the last batch, 350 gallons.

1596
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,477
And the company's
being very cooperative.

1597
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,640
Let's buy it.

1598
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,479
The company's not for sale, sir.

1599
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,312
The ice cream! Buy all of it.

1600
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,312
- How does it get here?
- By refrigerated truck.

1601
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,536
Well, why don't we fly it in?

1602
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,312
Ice cream does not travel
well on airplanes.

1603
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,231
Why don't we look into a...

1604
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,871
- ...refrigerated truck?
- That's a great idea, sir.

1605
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,896
Mr. Hughes, I'm finding more
and more tax advantages

1606
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,360
for buying up real estate in Nevada.

1607
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,910
With accelerated depreciation,
you get just as much on hotels

1608
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,798
- as you would on, on shopping centers.
- It's the White House again.

1609
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,720
Mr. Hughes, the White House
is calling again...

1610
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,075
I want banana nut ice cream!

1611
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,037
I am in the middle of a desert!

1612
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,752
Are you not in the desert with me?

1613
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,398
Is it not hot enough for the desert?

1614
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:23,758
Where do I put 350 gallons
of ice cream, huh?

1615
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,193
The same flavor!

1616
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,998
All of it is banana nut!

1617
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,355
All of it is banana nut! Carlos?

1618
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,200
Frank, we've been waiting
here for six weeks.

1619
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,919
I am his chief executive officer.

1620
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,353
I have to meet him.

1621
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,589
I understand, Mr. Maheu.

1622
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,755
Of course, you're right.
In California, abortion's...

1623
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,149
...not legal.

1624
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,200
You might wanna give
the whole thing more thought.

1625
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,631
♪ Jingle bells ♪

1626
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,312
♪ Jingle bells ♪

1627
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,470
♪ Jingle all the way... ♪

1628
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,391
Howard, I think we should meet.

1629
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,392
Moe Dalitz says he needs
you to change floors.

1630
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,913
They own the hotel.

1631
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,835
The mob is nothing to be fooled with.

1632
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,150
Can we please meet?

1633
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,071
Look, you ask that shitty
little Mafia hoodlum

1634
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,639
how much he wants for the hotel

1635
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,029
and say "yes" on the condition
he's out by Thursday.

1636
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:17,152
There is no need for you
or anyone else to see me.

1637
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,834
Howard. I feel I must advise you

1638
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,593
that you can still be made
to be seen in court

1639
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,238
in order to defend against charges

1640
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,799
that you mismanaged TWA.

1641
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,056
That's not true. That's not true.

1642
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,593
I'm also finding it very difficult

1643
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,159
to run your entire operation

1644
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:33,755
when I've never, ever
actually seen you.

1645
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,840
I mean, in the flesh.

1646
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,677
Do you realize that, Howard?

1647
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,352
That I've never actually seen you?

1648
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,868
Howard?

1649
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:04,354
Bob? If you were
to actually see me

1650
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:08,513
you could not represent me
in the way that I need to be.

1651
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,035
You are my chief executive officer,

1652
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,792
you are not my father.

1653
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,155
Okay, what's this?

1654
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,216
It's Stouffer frozen
turkey dinner, sir.

1655
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,595
Okay, well, I want you to
notify the Stouffer company

1656
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,511
to remove the dark meat of the turkey

1657
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,158
from the turkey frozen dinner.

1658
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:30,416
- Banana nut?
- Banana nut, sir.

1659
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,475
Forget banana nut!

1660
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,359
Okay. Levar!

1661
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,908
No more banana nut ice cream.
You got that?

1662
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,831
No more banana nut ice cream.
From now on...

1663
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,478
I want French vanilla.

1664
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,551
Goddamn it. I want French vanilla now.

1665
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,478
I want you to bring me
that schedule of Maheu's

1666
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,874
because I wanna know exactly

1667
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,536
what that son of a bitch is doing.

1668
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,518
Mr. Hughes,
Marla Mabrey has just come in.

1669
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,192
I put her in the speakerphone room.

1670
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,758
Shall I tell her
you're unavailable, sir?

1671
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,077
Frank, handle this, will you?

1672
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,315
Go talk to her.

1673
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,755
Tell her I'm just not seeing people.

1674
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,151
I want French vanilla from now on!

1675
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,310
French vanilla immediately.

1676
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,310
Hi.

1677
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,152
What can I do for you?

1678
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,670
It's my career, not yours.

1679
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,228
And you can help by accepting that.

1680
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,356
It's really none of
your business, Frank.

1681
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,549
Okay.

1682
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:36,789
But you can tell your boss

1683
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,598
I feel it's only right
that I meet with him

1684
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,591
before taking any action.

1685
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,428
I don't know. You never looked
at her screen test.

1686
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,750
She might have someone new
who's advising her.

1687
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,717
Who? An agent? Lawyer? What?

1688
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,456
Have you heard she might be
involved with somebody?

1689
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,550
I've heard nothing! I...

1690
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,029
Never mind. You go ahead.
I'll talk to her.

1691
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:07,920
Yes, sir.

1692
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,392
Marla?
Are you, are you there, Marla?

1693
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,635
Are you in the room?

1694
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,233
I can't do this

1695
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,475
on the telephone, Howard.

1696
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,754
I'm not seeing people.

1697
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,080
Something we didn't plan on
has happened.

1698
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,752
You better pick up the phone, Marla.

1699
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,398
We should have been more careful.

1700
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,440
From a single encounter,
Marla? From one time?

1701
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,317
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

1702
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:44,990
I'm surprised.

1703
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,880
I didn't think you were
that kind of a person.

1704
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,910
How much money are you looking for?

1705
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,376
Hey, is vanilla and French vanilla,
is it the same thing?

1706
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1707
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,080
Yes, it's the same?
I'm gonna go check on it.

1708
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,315
You're acting crazy.

1709
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:04,336
I know more about the business
than you think I do.

1710
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,016
Oh, all those big deals
in your future, Frank?

1711
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,096
You better get them in writing.

1712
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,216
I don't need them in writing.

1713
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,037
Well, that's right.
'Cause you trust him.

1714
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,696
He won't even meet with his wife.

1715
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,336
- Lucky woman.
- He won't let anybody look at him.

1716
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,456
- Oh, well, he's right!
- There's no reason...

1717
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,576
He's right. Because they might see
exactly what he is,

1718
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,556
a cold, sleazy, egomaniacal, old fake

1719
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:20,789
not worth meeting with.

1720
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,229
You wanna have meetings
or make movies?

1721
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,880
They got names for guys that are doing
what you're doing, Frank.

1722
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,513
Who do you think you're talking to?

1723
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,676
I think I'm talking to
somebody that sold out

1724
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,520
and you can tell the guy
that you sold out to

1725
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,516
that I'm never going back
to that stupid house!

1726
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,976
And he can throw
whatever's in it away.

1727
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,576
And that you wanna go home
to your fiancée

1728
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,953
and get legally married!

1729
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,736
Do you actually think that you're
going somewhere with Howard Hughes?

1730
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,796
You're even scared
to get on his plane!

1731
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,269
- Okay, just...
- Don't be physical with me, Frank!

1732
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,976
Whoever the hell
is advising you right now...

1733
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,560
You know, it's none of your business
who's advising me now!

1734
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,551
You need someone
who's advising you now!

1735
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,870
To move on, Frank, move on! I have!

1736
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,536
- Do you mind if I speak?
- Get out of here!

1737
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,120
No, because there's
nothing left to say!

1738
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,912
And if you call me,
I won't talk to you.

1739
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,911
So kindly treat
my privacy with respect!

1740
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Respect?

1741
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,917
Go back to your goddamn mystery man,

1742
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,877
with your privacy and your rings

1743
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,678
and don't worry about
me ever calling you.

1744
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,318
Believe me, I never will!

1745
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,296
Nadine, who called
that Maheu didn't tell me about?

1746
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,038
Today? The chairman of the FAA,

1747
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,633
the Under Secretary of Defense,

1748
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,676
the Treasury secretary,

1749
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,456
someone from the air traffic
controller's union,

1750
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,038
and a man from the AFL-CIO.

1751
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,509
All right, look, we're leaving
that son of a bitch Maheu

1752
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,511
alone in Vegas tonight.

1753
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,034
Nobody tells him about it!
He's finished. He's fired!

1754
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,473
We're going to Nicaragua.

1755
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:42,120
This isn't the only place
in the world without taxes!

1756
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,519
Get me my pilot's jacket.

1757
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:49,077
All right, come on, come on.
Let's go. Come on!

1758
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,276
Going through the kitchen now.

1759
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,549
It's all up to me.
Nothing gets bought,

1760
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,914
nothing gets sold without me.

1761
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,514
For all practical purposes,
I am Howard Hughes.

1762
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,736
Come on, Frank. Get outta the car.

1763
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,079
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1764
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,160
Come on!

1765
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:21,351
Frank, you can do this.
Come on. Flying can be fun.

1766
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,759
I think I'm ready.

1767
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,640
Okay, Cappy, it's about time
I did this again.

1768
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:32,232
Gentlemen, I am finally
gonna do something

1769
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,675
that I haven't done for far too long.

1770
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,876
Far too long.

1771
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,509
Cappy, this is Frank here's
first plane ride.

1772
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,040
I wanna make it memorable.

1773
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,872
- Everything ready?
- Yes, sir.

1774
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,029
Here we go.

1775
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,680
We got banana nut?

1776
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,550
Have we...

1777
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,517
- Uh...
- A pint and a half, sir.

1778
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,749
Pint and a half.

1779
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:55,229
Finally! It's been far too long!

1780
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,231
Far too long.

1781
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,435
Spoons.

1782
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,800
President Somoza is coming aboard!

1783
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,034
Mr. Hughes!

1784
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,156
Welcome to Nicaragua.

1785
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,118
You look incredible!

1786
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,997
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you. So do you.

1787
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,638
- You have not aged.
- Thank you.

1788
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,800
I wanna know
what you're doing in...

1789
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,911
There's an important message for you.

1790
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,638
"The United States
Federal Court decided today...

1791
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,116
"...in the case of TWA...

1792
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,680
"...a judgment of $645 million

1793
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,239
"against Howard Hughes...

1794
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,393
"...who refused to appear."

1795
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,437
This cannot be good.

1796
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,600
They think I'll have to sell

1797
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,471
the Hughes Tool Company to pay it?

1798
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,516
I'll never sell my daddy's company.

1799
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,192
My daddy would say it's time to call

1800
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,759
Raymond Holliday down in Houston.

1801
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,239
Get him to come down here.

1802
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:09,760
So...

1803
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,716
I just want you to know

1804
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,870
I don't think you're doing
the wrong thing.

1805
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,273
And I am so relieved

1806
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,555
that you're not
going back to Hollywood.

1807
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,393
Mom, I haven't told another
living soul about this.

1808
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,357
Doctor Diamond is a good man,

1809
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,992
and he's coming in on a Sunday.

1810
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,834
So, shall we go?

1811
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,110
Now, when you were 10 years old,

1812
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,016
when you used to come down
to your daddy's factory...

1813
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:34,076
Raymond, my daddy always trusted me

1814
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:35,388
to take care of things.

1815
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,296
Now, trying to take care
of the Hughes Tool Company

1816
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,230
at a time like this.

1817
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,016
That's like trying to
take care of my daddy.

1818
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,951
You're not your
daddy's father, Howard.

1819
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,234
Your daddy's dead.

1820
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,320
No, he's not.

1821
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,351
He's in my DNA.

1822
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:48,708
Oh, Lord!

1823
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,480
You know, you're gonna die, too.

1824
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:54,677
Who you gonna leave it to?
Whose DNA you gonna be in?

1825
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,398
In my opinion,
if you don't sign it now,

1826
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,959
they're gonna do what they said.

1827
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,398
They're gonna withdraw the offer
to buy the damn company.

1828
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,191
So, if I sign this thing,
would they still keep

1829
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:10,032
the Hughes name on the company?

1830
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,554
You don't drill for oil
with a name, Howard.

1831
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,656
You know, I'm planning on
doing a little flyin'.

1832
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:26,908
Do you wanna come?

1833
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,515
- Do a little flyin'?
- Hmm.

1834
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,468
What?

1835
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,354
I'm just not sure...

1836
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,954
...you ought to be thinkin'
about flyin' anymore, Howard.

1837
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:41,794
Come on in, Frank.

1838
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,394
Okay. Please give this
to the gentleman, and

1839
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,357
tell him that I have asked him

1840
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,556
to please consider

1841
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,631
keeping my father's name
on the company.

1842
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,468
This is signed.

1843
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,256
Mr. Hughes has asked you
to consider keeping

1844
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,838
his father's name on the company.

1845
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:25,360
I notice you don't say grace anymore.

1846
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,560
I don't mean to be negative,
but do we live

1847
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,635
in Nicaragua now?

1848
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,912
Although, I am kinda getting
to like Managua.

1849
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:57,120
Wave, Frank.

1850
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,515
Whoo. Let's keep it going.

1851
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,913
Don't worry, don't worry!

1852
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,877
I know how to handle earthquakes!

1853
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
We're going to London.

1854
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,520
Check out the tax setup,
Frank, and get me some codeine.

1855
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,376
The University of Virginia's
going coed.

1856
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,680
They're finally letting women in

1857
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,478
so I might even go for a doctorate

1858
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:10,959
and do my dissertation on music.

1859
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:11,870
Good for you.

1860
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,155
Thanks for not throwing
my things away, Nadine.

1861
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,071
I had no idea where to send them.

1862
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,720
Where do we call you in Virginia?

1863
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,833
Maybe it's better if I call you.

1864
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:33,839
Therefore, the percentages noted

1865
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,478
in the column were percentage of...

1866
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,080
Frank, we've been
in London too long with no fun.

1867
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,469
I want you
at the Gatwick Airport in 45 minutes

1868
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,551
in the DC-3.

1869
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,912
Give the man some credit.
He knows he can't fly.

1870
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,869
Mr. Hughes!

1871
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:02,474
So happy to finally meet you
in person, sir. At last!

1872
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,656
I'm sure you need
no introduction to the DC-3. This one,

1873
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:05,510
of course, is equipped with

1874
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,672
the Pratt & Whitney R-1830
Twin Wasp engines,

1875
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,558
- which improve...
- I know the DC-3 very well.

1876
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,030
Um...

1877
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:17,073
Certainly an improvement over the
original Cyclone 9s which were wanting

1878
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,096
- in the old oomph department.
- Where to, gentlemen?

1879
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:20,155
Where do we go?

1880
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,113
I don't know, sir.
If we are heading east,

1881
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:27,397
then that would be northern
France, possibly Belgium.

1882
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:29,550
What do you think,
wing commander? Belgian waffles?

1883
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:30,789
How does it sound?

1884
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,553
Uh, I don't know.

1885
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,680
All right, never mind.
You want a chicken sandwich?

1886
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,193
- Not hungry.
- Not hungry. Okay.

1887
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:38,080
How about you? Do you want
a chicken sandwich?

1888
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,037
- No, thank you.
- I got three.

1889
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,872
- I'm fine. Just eaten.
- No?

1890
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,231
Did you know that
you're 20% less likely to black out

1891
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,191
during a dive when you're my age?

1892
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,675
Because the arteries
are less expansive.

1893
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,110
No, I didn't know it, sir.

1894
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,315
Remember that.

1895
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,118
- Something to look forward to.
- Yes!

1896
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,553
Okay, let's go.

1897
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:05,478
I think we may have a door still open.

1898
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:08,518
Relax! I like it like that!
Just close the cockpit.

1899
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,351
Gentlemen, you ain't
seen nothin' yet.

1900
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,396
You know that line
Al Jolson used to use,

1901
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:14,754
"You ain't heard nothin' yet"?

1902
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,512
First time he ever sang it,
I saw him

1903
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,119
upstairs on the roof

1904
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,758
at the Amsterdam Theatre.
And it was

1905
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,034
a big charity show.

1906
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:24,032
Everybody's big stars,
big stars, and Jolson says,

1907
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:25,678
"I gotta close the show,

1908
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,637
"because I'm the world's
greatest entertainer

1909
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:30,029
"and nobody, but nobody,
follows Jolson."

1910
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,519
Well, everybody said,

1911
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,033
"Okay, Jolson, you're the greatest.

1912
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,269
"You close the show."

1913
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,952
There was only one problem though.

1914
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,996
Jolson didn't know
who he was following.

1915
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:39,792
Caruso.

1916
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,792
He's gotta get up and sing
after Enrico Caruso,

1917
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,075
the world's greatest voice! Ha!

1918
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,230
So, Caruso comes out,
he's singing in Italian.

1919
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,878
The audience just goes crazy.

1920
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,136
They go crazy.

1921
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,912
They're on their feet cheering.

1922
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,558
They won't sit down,
they're cheering!

1923
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,390
Caruso goes off,

1924
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:56,356
Jolson comes out.

1925
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,760
But he can't get them to shut up,

1926
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,153
because they want more Caruso.

1927
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,798
And finally Jolson shuts them up.

1928
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:03,110
He makes them sit down
and that's when he says it.

1929
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:06,636
He says, "You know,
you ain't heard nothing yet!"

1930
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,856
"You ain't heard nothing yet!"

Hey, Frank!

1949
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,350
Flyin' really gives a guy a chance

1950
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,696
to do some thinking, doesn't it?

1951
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:04,199
You know what
I'm thinking, Frank?

1952
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,555
I am thinking that
it's time for me to buy

01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,675
Pan American Airlines!

You ain't heard nothin' yet!

1955
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,834
Hey, where you goin'?
Come back here.

1956
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,480
Well, tell hotel security
to tell the mother...

1957
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,480
Yes, there's three of them.
They're all up here.

1958
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1959
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:27,916
Go this way.

1960
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,956
I have no idea how they got in.

1961
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,352
Come on, kid. Please!

1962
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,715
You gotta get out of here. Kid.

1963
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,030
I know where you are, kid.
Please come out.

1964
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,200
Please. Your mother
is waiting for you.

1965
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:42,880
Mr. Hughes!

1966
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,440
Mr. Hughes,

1967
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,595
we have wonderful news!

1968
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,319
The court of appeals
has reversed the TWA judgment.

1969
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:49,594
You get all the money back!

1970
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:52,831
Levar! Are you actually
so bird-brained

1971
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,056
you think I didn't know that?

1972
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,559
I get up earlier than you do.

1973
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:56,675
Hey, look at you.

1974
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,800
- What's your name?
- Hi.

1975
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,216
- Tommy.
- Would you like some ice cream?

1976
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,754
It'd be good for you!
Come on, let's go!

1977
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:03,719
Come on, kid. We gotta go.

1978
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:04,816
But he might like some ice cream.

1979
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,159
Well, his mother is very upset.

1980
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:08,176
Why did you talk to his mother?
He might have wanted ice cream.

1981
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,536
Wait out in the hall or somethin'.

1982
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:11,039
Why did you talk to his mother?

1983
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:13,111
I didn't talk to the mother.
I talked to security.

1984
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,480
You always say to keep kids out.

1985
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,033
Why did you talk to security?

1986
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,997
Because that's my job!

1987
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,354
- That is your job?
- Yes!

1988
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,656
You're telling me what your job is?

1989
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,159
Yes! That is my job!

1990
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,736
Your job is to tell me
what your job is!

1991
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,637
- Are you deaf?
- What?

1992
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,757
You are deaf. You're deaf!
And you're old.

1993
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,592
You're very old,
and you're very deaf!

1994
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:32,136
You calling me old and deaf?

1995
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,515
You're deaf, and you're old!
And very deaf, and very old!

1996
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:35,999
You do not know
what your job is.

1997
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,936
No, I know what my job is!
You do not know what my job is!

1998
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:39,136
You don't know what your job is!

1999
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:40,296
I know my job! I know my job!

2000
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,736
- You know what your job is?
- I know what my job is!

2001
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:42,795
You know, it's "was."

2002
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,880
- Is.
- Was.

2003
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,279
- Is. Is. Is.
- Was. Was.

2004
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,190
- Was?
- No, was.

2005
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,236
- Was?
- Was. That was your job.

2006
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,635
Get out.

2007
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,553
Sir, the mother's very upset.

2008
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,400
Get out.

2009
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:18,874
Take 14 days to make a decision
on Mulholland Canyon.

2010
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,040
Levar and I are gonna do it
whether you do it or not.

2011
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,191
I know it's hard for you
to trust people,

2012
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,511
but Levar is rooting for you
no matter how nutty you get.

2013
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:29,279
It would be a big advantage for us
to be in business with you,

2014
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,960
but it might be a big advantage
for you to be in business with us.

2015
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:33,110
If you decide not to,

2016
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:37,034
I can only respectfully
accept your decision and resign.

2017
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,350
Do you realize

2018
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:42,432
that your drug addiction
not only makes you more constipated,

2019
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:43,873
it makes you crazier?

2020
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,474
But since no one who works
for you, including me,

2021
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,118
will put their job on the line

2022
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,395
to try to keep you
from killing yourself,

2023
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,038
then maybe your wealth

2024
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:55,236
isn't always the best thing
for your health.

2025
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,990
Frank, how come you never
talk about your daddy?

2026
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:13,990
What?

2027
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:17,231
You never talk about
your daddy. How come?

2028
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:31,154
I could always tell my mother
how much I loved her, but I...

2029
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:34,556
I couldn't tell my daddy
that well...

2030
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,838
I don't know.

2031
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:41,794
But I miss my daddy.

2032
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:50,237
I wish I could just talk to him.

2033
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:14,470
You know, I think I never had a kid

2034
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,638
because I was afraid
that would make me feel old.

2035
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,231
Remember the night we went out to

2036
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:29,108
sit and look at the plane,
and had the burgers, you know?

2037
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:32,400
It was a hell of a hamburger.

2038
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,676
Do you still believe in

2039
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:51,190
what the church tells you to believe,

2040
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:52,869
like...

2041
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:55,679
In heaven and...

2042
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,397
I don't know, Mr. Hughes.

2043
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,708
Yeah, me either.

2044
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:05,428
I just...

2045
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:13,235
I don't wanna do what a person
has to do to find out.

2046
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:15,789
Um...

2047
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,474
All right, look,
I'll do Mulholland Canyon with you.

2048
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,757
And I'll do it big. But I just
got... Under one condition.

2049
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,595
From now on,

2050
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:28,955
will you call me Howard?

2051
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:34,314
Yeah!

2052
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,320
We are standing by

2053
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,992
for a telephone call from legendary

2054
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,640
billionaire Howard Hughes,
which could debunk a writer's claim...

2055
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:11,194
The writer that was mentioned
earlier, Richard Miskin,

2056
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:12,816
claims to have had access
to Howard Hughes.

2057
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:13,976
And during that time, he says

2058
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,376
that Hughes could not
remember anything,

2059
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:17,277
was incoherent, and unable

2060
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,395
to function.

2061
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,074
And that Hughes is in
a permanent state of dementia.

2062
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:23,077
The location of Howard Hughes

2063
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:24,673
is still a complete mystery to us.

2064
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:26,536
It will be
a major problem for Hughes...

2065
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,816
- Yeah.
- ...if he doesn't call us

2066
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,512
as promised
by the Hughes organization,

2067
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,238
and defend himself against

2068
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,992
the charges in Miskin's book.

2069
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:35,150
One of
the pioneers who helped in...

2070
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:36,070
Howard.

2071
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,434
...was Howard Hughes.

2072
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:39,790
He's one of the most
influential individuals

2073
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,711
of the last quarter century.

2074
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:44,598
Well, if she won't
even tell you her name...

2075
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:46,376
Hughes was romantically linked

2076
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,816
to several young actresses
over the years...

2077
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:48,909
Yeah.

2078
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:52,958
Okay.

2079
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,918
...manufactured
a 25 million dollar flying boat.

2080
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,576
Meanwhile,
we're told that the writer,

2081
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,989
Richard Miskin,
may speak to us soon.

2082
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,350
She's okay, guys. I got this.

2083
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,237
These guys do their job.

2084
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:18,320
Yeah, well...

2085
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,040
They're new.

2086
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,192
Why didn't you tell anybody
who you were?

2087
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,976
Well, the last conversation
I had with Howard

2088
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,149
wasn't very pleasant.

2089
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:28,629
I have something to tell him
before he talks to the press.

2090
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,669
Matt?

2091
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:35,914
Matt, this is Levar.
Levar, this is Matt.

2092
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,594
- Hi.
- Hello, Matt.

2093
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:40,520
Hi.

2094
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,272
We have here the writer
of the book, Richard Miskin.

2095
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:47,318
Mr. Miskin, Hughes' people say
your book is a fake.

2096
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:50,517
That he has never met
or even spoken with you.

2097
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:53,433
I don't think you'll
hear Mr. Hughes say that

2098
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,999
or anything else much.

2099
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,674
I don't think you're going
to be hearing from him.

2100
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,398
I doubt he even
remembers the book.

2101
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:01,038
Let me ask you again...

2102
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:02,616
Sir, Howard Hughes
is a disturbed creature.

2103
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,073
And my heart goes out to him.

2104
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,720
But if it is upon
his flimsy recollection

2105
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,836
that you're hinging your reportage,

2106
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:11,633
then good luck to you.

2107
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:13,358
That's all I have to say.

2108
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,793
Good afternoon.

2109
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,677
Thank you, Mr. Miskin.

2110
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:18,273
And now back to you.

2111
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:21,193
Do we know what
qualified experts have to say

2112
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:25,068
about the psychiatric
implications of Mr. Hughes',

2113
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:27,469
uh, reclusive behavior?

2114
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,736
One could speculate...

2115
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:30,432
Howard.

2116
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:31,656
...possibly catatonic at this point.

2117
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,272
No one seems to know.

2118
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,776
That could have a bearing

2119
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:37,268
on a lot of his business interests.

2120
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:40,238
It could affect his defense
contracts, for example.

2121
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:41,833
A long list,

2122
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:43,456
including the Hughes
Medical Foundation, right?

2123
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:44,856
The Hughes casino licenses

2124
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,120
in Las Vegas could be affected.

2125
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,576
And if this call
does not come in soon...

2126
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,158
All right.

2127
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:51,616
Helicopter
to the public and Air Force officers

2128
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,551
at Culver City, California.

2129
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:57,076
Powered by turbojet motors,
the huge copter is designed

2130
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:59,993
primarily to lift great weights.
It is the largest aircraft

2131
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,638
- of its kind known.
- Hi.

2132
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:03,119
And when perfected, it's expected

2133
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,872
- to take off...
- Long time.

2134
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,376
...carry the load
of a small freight car.

2135
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:07,400
Yeah, long time.

2136
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:10,472
...upwards of a hundred persons.
The copter itself...

2137
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:11,720
Hey, how about this guy, huh?

2138
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:13,995
...pounds, and its
rotating blades measure...

2139
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,433
Frank, this is my son, Matt.

2140
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,590
...from tip to tip.

2141
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:18,516
Hi, Matt.

2142
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:19,669
Hi.

2143
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:21,816
Matt, when I first went to Hollywood,

2144
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:22,896
Frank picked up your grandmother

2145
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,035
and me at the plane.

2146
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:26,440
...future of flight in all its varied
and promising phases.

2147
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,160
What kind of ice cream
have we got, Levar?

2148
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,555
I heard some talk about rum raisin.

2149
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:31,640
Here, Matt, I'll show you

2150
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,755
where the rum raisin is.

2151
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,456
...phone call
from billionaire Howard Hughes.

2152
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,480
Have a seat there, guys.

2153
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:36,350
Okay.

2154
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:38,954
...a writer by
the name of Richard Miskin,

2155
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,031
that Hughes is unable
to remember anything...

2156
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,160
I talked to Mamie Murphy.

2157
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,111
She knows Richard Miskin.

2158
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,111
Howard may have
some questions.

2159
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,416
...historical footage
featuring Howard Hughes's...

2160
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:49,634
It's good to see you, Marla.

2161
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:51,256
...in aviation.

2162
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,156
For me, too.

2163
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:55,550
The 40-ton, 57 -passenger liner that...

2164
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:56,993
I'll let him know you're here.

2165
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:58,296
...which has made
a newtrans-continental,

2166
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,038
non-stop speed record

2167
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:02,079
Here's the start.

2168
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,296
...what might be next
for the Hughes organization,

2169
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:08,677
if Mr. Hughes never steps forward
to defend himself against the claims

2170
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,079
in Mr. Miskin's book?

2171
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:12,799
Howard, Marla Mabrey has come here.

2172
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,189
She says she has something
to tell you about Miskin.

2173
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,474
I told her I'd let you know.

2174
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,520
...certainly
going to be embarrassing

2175
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,830
for Hughes and his entire empire.

2176
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:23,229
How does one explain away the fact

2177
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:25,550
that the man can't even make
a simple telephone call?

2178
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:26,789
Bring her in.

2179
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,916
I suppose they could

2180
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,838
still come out with some kind
of alternative evidence.

2181
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,672
Struggling out of its
swaddling clothes.

2182
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:37,513
And one of the pioneers who
helped was Howard Hughes,

2183
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,000
still active in the industry today.

2184
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:41,196
As a stunt,
the point of aviation speed...

2185
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:43,576
David,
I'm looking at the clock

2186
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,080
and if the call doesn't come by 4:30,

2187
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:46,639
then it will be hard to defend

2188
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:49,154
Howard Hughes against the charges
in Richard Miskin's book.

2189
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:50,240
Howard?

2190
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:51,536
The clock is ticking, David.

2191
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:52,629
Hello, Marla.

2192
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:55,792
Any thoughts
as to what may happen...

2193
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:56,880
We've lost touch.

2194
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:59,279
I'm sorry I was in

2195
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:02,113
such a bad mood
when you came to Las Vegas.

2196
01:50:03,240 --> 01:50:04,673
When was that?

2197
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:06,751
Five years ago?

2198
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:09,832
I was not at my best.

2199
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:11,270
I know that, Howard.

2200
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,190
Neither was I.

2201
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,953
Mamie Murphy knows
Richard Miskin very well.

2202
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,554
She told me that she was
very sure he never met you.

2203
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,437
She'd testify
if you wanted her to.

2204
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,776
...go a long way
towards debunking a writer's claim

2205
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:24,030
that he has written an...

2206
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:25,519
I came with my son.

2207
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:30,912
And has now gone into
what could best be described as...

2208
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,149
Excuse me?

2209
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:33,559
I came with my son.

2210
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:36,434
He's in the living room.

2211
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,476
And there's another point to be...

2212
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,788
And the father?

2213
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,359
...if Hughes does not

2214
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,829
prove that he's still alive,
and there is some question

2215
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,558
as to whether he is.

2216
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,676
Just someone I took up with.
It didn't last long.

2217
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,796
The call was, incidentally,

2218
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:51,074
supposed to come in at 4:00.

2219
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:53,594
Would you like me to meet your son?

2220
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:56,680
Sure.

2221
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:57,896
If that call were to come in

2222
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,956
within the next several minutes...

2223
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,554
Matt? You wanna meet Mr. Hughes?

2224
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:06,313
...from New York
to New York in four days.

2225
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,356
New aviation history is written.

2226
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:11,716
Howard Hughes
simply does not allow himself

2227
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:13,279
to be seen by anyone.

2228
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,351
Howard, this is Matt.

2229
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:17,856
It'll be very,
very difficult to defend Howard Hughes

2230
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:18,790
against the charges...

2231
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,279
Say hello to Mr. Hughes, Matt.

2232
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:23,150
Hello.

2233
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,576
...covering him
for a long, long time. As have you.

2234
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:26,953
How old are you, Matt?

2235
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:28,710
Four and a half.

2236
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,597
I'm curious
as to what's going to become

2237
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:32,160
of the empire that he...

2238
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:48,474
You look like I thought you'd look.

2239
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,673
So do you.

2240
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,120
Why do you stay in this room?

2241
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,560
You know, I really
should get out more.

2242
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,351
Okay, Frank, get Hollywood
on the phone.

2243
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:26,077
Nadine, get Los Angeles, fast.

2244
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:28,196
They're still on the line, Frank!

2245
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,998
Get it, get it. I'm going to do this.

2246
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:32,149
Howard, you can just...

2247
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:33,753
Frank, they're still on the line!

2248
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,120
They're still on the line? Good.

2249
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,312
Matt, you wanna stick around
for a while?

2250
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:43,676
Frank, where do I put it?

2251
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,915
- Do I pin this on?
- Yeah.

2252
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,752
That goes around my neck?

2253
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:52,750
We are being told

2254
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:55,673
we will hear from
Howard Hughes immediately.

2255
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,352
We are standing by.

2256
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:58,656
I think that's the man
I'm gonna be talking to,

2257
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,033
- but we'll see...
- Frank!

2258
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:02,795
This belongs to him. I'm sorry.

2259
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:06,358
Matt, I'll wait for you
in the living room.

2260
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:09,256
If you just joined us,

2261
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:11,111
we're standing by for a phone call

2262
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,872
from billionaire Howard Hughes.

2263
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,712
We've been told the call
is coming in...

2264
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:17,096
I'm told
someone claiming to be Howard Hughes

2265
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,678
will be speaking to us momentarily,

2266
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:20,751
so we can assess whether he is indeed

2267
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:22,512
Howard Hughes.

2268
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,477
Are you there, Mr. Hughes?

2269
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,558
Good afternoon.

2270
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,856
Where are you speaking from, sir?

2271
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,313
I'm speaking from Acapulco,

2272
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,358
which is a city seaport
in the state of Guerrero

2273
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,829
on the Pacific coast of Mexico.

2274
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:43,469
About 190 miles southwest
of Mexico City,

2275
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:47,030
located on a deep, semicircular bay.

2276
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,376
I would say that the municipality

2277
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,595
has an area of about

2278
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:52,272
726.9

2279
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:53,475
square miles and

2280
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:56,791
it is the largest city
in the state. Far larger than

2281
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,075
the state capital, Chilpancingo.

2282
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:01,549
The name Acapulco
comes from the Nahuatl

2283
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:04,837
language. It means
"place of big reeds,"

2284
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:06,069
and that is where I am.

2285
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:08,151
Next question, please.

2286
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:10,356
Gene Handsaker,
Associated Press. Tell us a little

2287
01:54:10,440 --> 01:54:11,634
about the H-One.

2288
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,438
Well, we first called it "The Racer."

2289
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:16,159
It was designed by me in
conjunction with Dick Palmer.

2290
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:18,117
We built it in a small building

2291
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:20,873
of what has now become
the Lockheed terminal,

2292
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,951
and that, by the way, Gene Handsaker,

2293
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,996
is where you and I first met.

2294
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:27,310
This airplane had a metal fuselage

2295
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:29,675
with butt joints of which
we were very proud.

2296
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:30,869
It had flush

2297
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,758
rivets which later became
standard in the industry.

2298
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,068
It had a wooden wing

2299
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:36,070
which, of course, did not

2300
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,536
become standard,
but it was the only thing

2301
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:38,709
at the time that had

2302
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:41,519
the smooth surface
that we needed. As I say,

2303
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,238
a single engine,

2304
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:46,033
single-seat airplane,
a beautiful little thing.

2305
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:47,599
I still have it, actually,

2306
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,716
out at the factory at Culver City.

2307
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:51,711
You should go out there
sometime, Gene,

2308
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:54,519
and take a look at it.
Next question, please.

2309
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:58,430
Gladwin Hill,
for The New York Times.

2310
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:00,511
How well I know you, Mr. Hughes.

2311
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:03,879
How well do you know
the book's writer, Richard Miskin?

2312
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,558
I don't know him.

2313
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:07,915
I've never seen him.
I've never even heard of him

2314
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,877
until two days ago.

2315
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,030
Hi, Howard. Vernon Scott here.

2316
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:15,096
As soon as you started
to talk, I knew it was Howard Hughes.

2317
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:16,519
Did you really wear tennis shoes

2318
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,352
with your tuxedo?

2319
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:21,000
Yeah, well, they were shoes made of

2320
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,389
sort of a non-strategic material.

2321
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,034
Kind of a canvas or imitation leather.

2322
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:28,111
I had a pair of these
that I liked very much.

2323
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:29,997
I would wear them, and then they...

2324
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:31,856
Some people called them
tennis shoes, but I...

2325
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:34,553
I don't think they had anything to do
with being on a tennis court.

2326
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:36,416
Can I ask you
a couple of questions

2327
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:38,476
relating to national security?

2328
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:40,152
Oh, I don't think so.

2329
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:44,153
You know, I don't care to appear
in public very often, but...

2330
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:46,470
I really should get out more.

2331
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,309
But it has been a pleasure
speaking to you, gentlemen.

2332
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:52,958
Any time. Good evening.

2333
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:57,552
I think that concludes

2334
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:59,835
our press conference. Thank you,

2335
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:01,194
Mr. Hughes.

2336
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,635
I think there's a publisher
with a problem on his hands.

2337
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:04,630
You were really good.

2338
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,472
I have to go find my mom. Bye.

2339
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:07,788
Kid! Kid!

2340
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:09,275
Kid?

2341
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:16,856
Things are looking up, Frank.

2342
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,711
You did good.

2343
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,233
We're going back to Hollywood.

2344
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,276
I feel good!

2345
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:23,936
I think it's time to go home!
You know...

2346
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:25,109
Howard...

2347
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:28,720
You've done a lot of great things,

2348
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,560
and you've done a lot
of great things for me.

2349
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:32,596
I think it is time
for you to go home.

2350
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:35,272
And I think it's time
for me to move on.

2351
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,558
What?

2352
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:45,468
I'm quitting, Howard.

2353
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,194
Where'd they go?

2354
01:56:57,320 --> 01:56:58,514
They kinda slipped out.

2355
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,399
Keep an eye on him, Levar.

2356
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,352
Frank?

2357
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:07,635
Frank?

2358
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:46,160
You think it's time
we give it a try?

2359
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:27,280
Let's get Matt.

2360
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:51,676
Hey, you know what?
I got a really good idea!

2361
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:57,189
What's in those bottles?

2362
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,350
That's water.

2363
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:01,515
From Maine.

2364
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:05,355
Water.

2365
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:07,389

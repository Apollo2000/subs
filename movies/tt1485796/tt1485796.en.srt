- CHALMERS: Mr. Smith?
- SMITH: Yes.

179
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:23,945
- CHALMERS: Have a look at this.
- SMITH: Of course.

180
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:26,049
(typing and clacking)

181
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:33,489
(typing and clacking continues)

182
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:44,631
SMITH:
Yes, yes, I see it.

183
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:46,099
Thank you,
Chalmers, that'll do.

184
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:48,470
Sir, Phineas Taylor Barnum.

185
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:50,337
If I may, sir...

186
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,005
I believe
I have skills and ideas

187
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:53,441
that go well beyond
punching numbers

188
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:54,408
into an adding machine.

189
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,876
Well, I've read about
this German fellow,

190
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:57,543
Lilienthal, I believe,
who's developed

191
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:00,115
a glider that can take
a man in the air, sir.

192
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:01,414
Isn't that amazing?

193
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,582
I mean, if you were
to apply that to this business,

194
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:04,985
it would be revolutionary.

195
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:07,855
Gentlemen!
Can I have your attention?

196
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,692
You're all dismissed.

197
00:12:10,824 --> 00:12:12,125
Bankrupt?

198
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:14,227
I thought the company
had a dozen trading ships.

199
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:16,332
Yes, at the bottom
of the South China Sea.

200
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:19,436
Typhoon sank 'em all.

201
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,172
(indistinct murmuring)

202
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:49,299
(children chattering)

203
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,166
(imitating gunfire)

204
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:55,237
(squealing, giggling)

205
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:59,342
- Tag, you're it!
- Oh, you're in for it!

206
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:01,076
Hey.

207
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:03,744
Oh, God! You're home early.

208
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:05,314
And until further notice.

209
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:11,485
Well, I didn't think
you were long for that job.

210
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:13,320
Or any job, apparently.

211
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:15,759
That's what makes our life
together so exciting.

212
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:18,127
Charity.

213
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,764
This isn't the life
I promised you.

214
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:25,667
But I have everything I want.

215
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:27,235
What about the magic?

216
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:28,970
What do you call
those two girls?

217
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:31,672
(laughing)

218
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:34,044
Hey, you partners, look who
moseyed into the corral.

219
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:36,977
Daddy!

220
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,312
- PHINEAS: Come here!
- Did you bring a present?

221
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:39,879
- A present for what?
- (laughing)

222
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,513
- For my birthday!
- Your what?

223
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:44,217
- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.

224
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:47,152
Okay, I do have a present...

225
00:13:47,154 --> 00:13:49,289
but not just any present.
Oh, no.

226
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,760
The most amazing
birthday present ever.

227
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:55,328
This extraordinary machine
was originally created

228
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,264
by Leonardo da Vinci,
400 years ago.

229
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:59,634
But the blueprints had been
lost for centuries

230
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:01,936
until just last week,
on a stormy night,

231
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:04,070
when a sunken pirate ship
washed up

232
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:05,873
on the shores of Nantucket.

233
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,175
They found skeletons
and treasures

234
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:10,008
and the blueprints
were recovered

235
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,115
by none other
than J. W. Mercantile.

236
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:17,518
The blueprints crossed my desk
very briefly

237
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,586
but I managed
to commit them to memory.

238
00:14:19,588 --> 00:14:23,794
And if I have
remembered correctly...

239
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:32,569
Happy birthday, Caroline.

240
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:41,643
This is a wishing machine.

241
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:43,547
You tell it your wishes...

242
00:14:44,546 --> 00:14:47,514
and it keeps them safe
until they come true.

243
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:51,552
Even if you forget them,
they're always there.

244
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:52,719
Can I tell a wish?

245
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:55,221
Step right up. Go ahead.

246
00:14:55,223 --> 00:14:59,026
I wish to marry Santa Claus.

247
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,832
That is a good wish.

248
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:05,701
I wish for ballet slippers.

249
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:13,775
Hey, that's a good wish, too.

250
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:16,179
What's your wish, Mommy?

251
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,682
I wish...

252
00:15:24,087 --> 00:15:27,120
for happiness
like this forever

253
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:28,825
for you and you...

254
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:32,429
and for your father.

255
00:15:32,928 --> 00:15:34,596
Boring!

256
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:36,297
- CHARITY: Boring?
- (Phineas laughs)

257
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,600
Since when has happiness
ever been boring?

- Charles, we're leaving.
- Huh?

271
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:35,657
This bank only wants
to lend money

272
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:36,793
to people with money.

273
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:43,766
What are you
looking at, flop-doodle?

274
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:47,938
Mr. Barnum.

275
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:53,740
This venture you propose
is risky and somewhat bizarre.

276
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:55,710
It's a good bet
is what it is, sir.

277
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:57,378
People don't
want to admit it...

278
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,149
but they're fascinated
with the exotic and the macabre.

279
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:01,817
It's why we stare at it.

280
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:04,621
The bank is going to need
substantial collateral.

281
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:09,122
Of course. I, uh,
I wouldn't suggest otherwise.

282
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:11,225
The deed and title
to my entire flotilla

283
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:12,429
of trading vessels.

284
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:18,331
CHARITY: <i>Why would a
bank loan us $10,000?</i>

285
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,667
Because we put up collateral.

286
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:22,136
But, dear, we don't
have any collateral.

287
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:23,137
Sure we do.

288
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:24,406
In the South China Seas.

289
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:26,106
In the South China Seas?

290
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:28,342
Deep in the South China Seas.

291
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:31,545
And what did
we buy with this loan?

292
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:34,782
"Barnum's American Museum
of Curiosities."

293
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:36,453
What kind of museum is it?

294
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:39,187
(laughs)

295
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:40,620
A place to be transported.

296
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:42,222
A place where people
can see things

297
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:43,392
they've never seen before.

298
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:44,625
Huh?

299
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:46,726
- Wax figures?
- Yeah. Yeah.

300
00:17:46,728 --> 00:17:48,595
They're all the rage
in Europe. Look.

301
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:51,233
Marie Antoinette with the
sore throat. Napoleon.

302
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,133
Come here. See?

303
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:56,036
You've already met some of the
most famous folks in history.

304
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:57,405
But they're not all wax.

305
00:17:57,407 --> 00:18:00,908
This is the great O'Malley.

306
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,677
Master of sleight of hand.
A king of deception.

307
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,582
You don't look like a magician.

308
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:07,881
I'm a thief.

309
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:08,981
A very good thief.

310
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:11,051
- I caught him nicking my watch.
- (coin clatters)

311
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:12,153
- See?
- An elephant!

312
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:13,255
Not just any elephant.

313
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:14,254
I can get you
somethin' real nice.

Thank you.

316
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:17,624
Oh, yeah.
This is a ten-ton bull

317
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:19,627
straight from
the plains of Africa.

318
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:22,196
- And look at that.
- (laughing)

319
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:24,167
The tallest giraffe
in the world.

320
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:25,698
CAROLINE:
Can I climb up its leg?

321
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,100
- Absolutely not. Okay.
- (giggling)

322
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:31,071
Now, I know how it looks.

323
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:32,505
If you didn't,
I'd be worried.

324
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:34,341
I mean, it just
needs a little work, but...

325
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:35,775
The loan has to be
paid back every month.

326
00:18:35,777 --> 00:18:37,677
Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it.
We just need customers.

327
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,350
- Hundreds of them.
- We're gonna get them.

329

Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

330
00:18:44,286 --> 00:18:45,652
It is one hour
of your time, sir,

331
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:47,187
but it will change your life.

332
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,522
We have shows
on the hour every hour.

333
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:50,190
I love your dress.

334
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,658
Surely not for
the faint of heart,

335
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,561
but I can tell
you're gonna love it.

336
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:55,463
Half price for anyone
who's wearing a hat.

337
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:56,697
Ho, ho! That's you, sir.

338
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:59,734
- Welcome to the Barnum Museum.
- (sighs)

339

(horse neighs)

340

Load of garbage.

341
00:19:06,676 --> 00:19:08,276
Goodness, no. It's rubbish.

342
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:10,343
Welcome to the Barnum Museum,
where everyone's special...

343
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:12,146
How many tickets?

344
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:14,417
- Three.
- Three.

345
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:41,076
CAROLINE:
Daddy.

346
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,049
Daddy.

347
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:54,487
Did you sell
any more tickets today?

348
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:56,624
A few. Yeah.

349
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:58,891
Most everyone was rushing home,
it's Friday,

350
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:03,863
but we sold a few.

351
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:07,967
I think you have too many dead
things in your museum, Daddy.

352
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,368
Do you?

353
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,676
She's right.
You need something alive.

354
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:17,344
Go to sleep, both of you.

355
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,682
Something sensational.

356
00:20:20,315 --> 00:20:21,916
That's a big word.

357
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:24,119
It's your word.

358
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:27,120
Something that isn't stuffed.

359
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:29,625
- Like a mermaid.
- Or a unicorn.

360
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:33,327
Unicorns aren't real.

361
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:35,800
<i>Well, mermaids
aren't real either.</i>

364

I'm looking for your son.

365
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,765
I don't have a son.

366
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,097

Charles, right? Age 22?

368
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:18,775
GERTRUDE:

I am putting together a show

373
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:42,131
and I need a star.

374
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:45,366
You want people
to laugh at me.

375
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:46,699
Well, they're laughing
anyway, kid,

376
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:47,970
so might as well get paid.

377
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,447
I see a soldier,
no, a general

378

riding across the stage
with a sword and a gun,

and... and...

380
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:07,087
and the most beautiful uniform
ever made.

381
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:08,988
People will come
from all over the world,

382
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,994
and when they see him,
they won't laugh.

383
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:13,730
(door unlocks)

384
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,836
They'll salute.

Ah, Mr. Bennett
from the <i>Herald.</i>

558
00:31:00,757 --> 00:31:02,857
Come to take in
another show, huh?

559
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,057
Tell me, Mr. Barnum,

560
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:05,225
does it bother you

561
00:31:05,227 --> 00:31:08,131
that everything
you're selling is fake?

562
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:10,496
Do these smiles seem fake?

563
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:11,765
It doesn't matter
where they come from.

564
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:12,999
The joy is real.

565
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,567
So, you are a philanthropist?

566
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:17,303
Well, hyperbole
isn't the worst crime.

567
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:20,307
Men suffer more from imagining
too little than too much.

568
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:22,744
The creed of a true fraud.

569
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,314
Mr. Bennett, when was
the last time you smiled

570
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:28,718
or had a good laugh?
Like a real laugh?

571
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:33,286
A theater critic who can't
find joy in the theater.

572
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:35,525
Now who's a fraud?

573
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:40,061
Oh, Mr. Bennett.

574
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:42,833
That word you used
to describe my show?

575
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:45,101

00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:20,670

00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:23,806
Wow.

585
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:27,506
Helen, that's for you.

586
00:32:27,508 --> 00:32:28,577
(gasps)

587
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:33,815
And Caroline,
this is for you.

588
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,091
There's a ballet school
right down the street.

589
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,661
Just past your
parents' house, actually.

590
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:48,861
Don't tell me
you bought this house

591
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:51,230
just to rub my parents' noses
in your success?

592
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:53,435
Well, that wasn't
the only reason.

593
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:57,239
This is the life I promised you.

594
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,408
Shall we?

595
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,909
Phin, it's beautiful,

596
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:04,747
but you know, we don't
need all of this to be...

597
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,213
It only took me 25 years,

598
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:09,182

that young man over there?

604
00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:01,901
Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle.

605
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:04,338
A bit of a scandal, they say.

606
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,938
His last play
was a hit in London.

607
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,541
Play? You pay good money

608
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:10,111
to watch people stand around
and talk for two hours

609
00:34:10,113 --> 00:34:11,578
and they call me a con man.

610
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,949
Ew, what's that smell?
Do you smell that?

611
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:17,183
Ew. Something does smell.

612
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:20,054
Oh, I know what it is.
Peanuts.

613

(girls snickering)

614
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:31,330
I can see it right now.

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,472
I'm quitting.

618
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:39,373
What? Why would you quit?

619
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,808
I started too late.
I'll never catch up.

620
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,946
Caroline, you were the best
dancer on that stage.

621
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,348
What? You think
I can't spot talent?

622
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,018
Ballet takes years
of hard work.

623
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,389
It's not like the circus.

624
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:55,356
You can't just fake it.

625
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:01,161
She can't quit. No.

626
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:02,429
No, I mean, she just...

627
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:04,266
She just feels out of place
with the other girls.

628
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,799
Well, I should
certainly hope so.

629
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:08,134
I've never seen so many
little prima donnas in my life.

630
00:35:08,136 --> 00:35:10,371
Yeah, but those prima donnas
are the most important thing

631
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:11,705
in the world to her right now.

632
00:35:11,707 --> 00:35:14,107
She'll learn to ignore them
just like I did.

633
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:15,542
She shouldn't have to.

634
00:35:15,544 --> 00:35:17,545
New York society
will never accept us.

635
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:19,379
If they did,
they'd have to stop judging

636
00:35:19,381 --> 00:35:21,248
and actually do something
with their lives.

637
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,618
This isn't about me.

638
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:28,422
Oh. So it's different
than everything else then?

639
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:31,091
I just want her to be proud
of who she is, of her family.

640
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:33,192
She is proud.

641
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:34,797
We don't have
to be the Carlyles.

642
00:35:40,435 --> 00:35:42,502
Mr. Carlyle.
You produced this play?

643
00:35:42,504 --> 00:35:44,669
Yes, I did indeed.

644
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:46,907
Refunds are available
at the front box office.

645
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:48,711
(chuckles)
P.T. Barnum.

646
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:49,643
From the circus?

647
00:35:49,645 --> 00:35:51,645
Yes. You... you've been?

648
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:55,116
God, no. But I have
seen the crowds.

649
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:57,750
People leave your shows a great deal
happier than when they came in.

650
00:35:57,752 --> 00:36:00,420
Which is much more
than I can say for my play.

651
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:02,658
And yet, you have
no trouble selling tickets.

652
00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:06,061
That's because
I'm selling virtue.

653
00:36:08,364 --> 00:36:09,699
Can I buy you a drink?

654
00:36:11,768 --> 00:36:14,101
I wanna go after
the carriage trade.

655
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:16,203
Present legitimate acts,

656
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:19,574
expand our appeal,
go after the snobs.

657
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:21,942
If you only knew
how suffocating they are.

658
00:36:21,944 --> 00:36:23,411
So come join the circus.

659
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:25,014
You clearly have a flair
for show business.

660
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:28,384
Teach me how to appeal
to the highbrows.

661
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:31,618
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

662
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,019
Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off
and join the circus.

663
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:36,023
Why not?
Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?

664
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:37,992
Let's just say that I find it
much more comfortable

665
00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:39,794
admiring your show from afar.

666
00:36:39,796 --> 00:36:41,462
Comfort, the enemy of progress.

667
00:36:41,464 --> 00:36:43,264
Do you understand that
just associating with you

668
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:44,899
could cost me my inheritance?

669
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:46,667
Oh, it could cost you
more than that.

670
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:48,268
You'd be risking everything.

671
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,036
But, on the other hand, well,

672
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:53,140
you just might
find yourself a free man.

765
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:05,958
W.D., Anne, I wanna introduce

766
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,064
my newest hire,
Mr. Phillip Carlyle.

767
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,734
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah, pleasure.

768
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:15,071
And what is your act,
Mr. Carlyle?

769
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,673
I don't have an act.

770
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:20,743
Everyone's got an act.

771

O'MALLEY:
Mr. Barnum!

772
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:28,985
Yeah.

773
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:31,354
You better come see this.

PHINEAS:
Phillip, keep up!

775
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,592
- (indistinct shouting)
- A bit of a nasty element.

776
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:41,997
There always is, isn't there?

777
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:44,931
Nothing draws a crowd
quite like a crowd.

We don't want you in our city!

00:41:49,904 --> 00:41:51,371
PHINEAS:
"Shame of the city."

782
00:41:51,373 --> 00:41:53,907
"The protests cement
Mr. Barnum's reputation

783
00:41:53,909 --> 00:41:56,810
as a purveyor of the offensive
and indecent."

784
00:41:56,812 --> 00:42:00,679
"Offensive and indecent."
Mr. Bennett, I am blushing.

785
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:03,583
No, I'm blushing.
(giggling)

786
00:42:03,585 --> 00:42:05,284
What do you care
what Bennett thinks?

787
00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:07,219
- LETTIE: He's a prig.
- And a snob.

788
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:09,388
Yeah, and all the snobs
in New York read him.

789
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,825
He does their thinking for them.

790
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:13,293
Whatever happened to
thriving off controversy?

791
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:15,162
Yeah, well...
Hey.

792
00:42:15,164 --> 00:42:17,029
- Do you have any thoughts on this?
- HELEN: Phillip!

793
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:19,366
You know what?
As a matter of fact, I do.

794
00:42:19,368 --> 00:42:20,635
Helen, come on.

795
00:42:20,637 --> 00:42:21,936
"The Master of the Household

796
00:42:21,938 --> 00:42:23,837
"has it in command
of the Queen

797
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,806
"to invite
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum

798

to a reception
at Buckingham Palace."

800
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:34,013
The Queen Victoria?
Is this real?

801
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:35,983
I had to pull a few strings.

802
00:42:35,985 --> 00:42:38,253
If you want society
to accept you,

803
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,553
you may as well start...

804
00:42:39,555 --> 00:42:42,326
- at the very, very top.
- (giggles)

805
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,961
Are we all invited?

806
00:42:53,669 --> 00:42:55,102
I guess I'll just
have to tell the Queen

807
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:57,038
that either all of us go...

808
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,476
or none of us will.

809
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:04,311
(all cheering)

810
00:43:04,313 --> 00:43:07,282
The Queen of England!
Can't get much better than that.

811
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:16,858
PHILLIP:
Why aren't we in tails?

812
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,991
PHINEAS:
We're the entertainment.

813
00:43:17,993 --> 00:43:20,162
LETTIE:
Don't see you in a costume.

814
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,901
Your Majesty,
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum...

815
00:43:26,903 --> 00:43:31,809
and his Oddities from America!

816
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:35,607
(indistinct murmuring)

817
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:37,380
WOMAN:
Is that real?

818
00:43:40,848 --> 00:43:43,018
(indistinct whispering,
murmuring)

819
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:54,961
Your Majesty.
May I present Mr. Barnum.

820
00:43:54,963 --> 00:43:57,365
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.

821
00:43:58,133 --> 00:43:59,499
And I've heard all about

822
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:02,504
your little colonel from
my friends in America.

823
00:44:03,305 --> 00:44:05,039
General, ma'am.

824
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,873
You're even smaller
than I imagined.

825
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,241
Well, you're not exactly

826
00:44:08,243 --> 00:44:10,277
reaching the top shelf
yourself, sweetheart.

827
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:11,949
(crowd gasping)

828
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,254
(laughing)

829
00:44:23,392 --> 00:44:25,996
(crowd laughing)

830
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:34,069
That went well.

831
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:37,738
STEWARD:
Your Majesty.

832
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,040
PHINEAS:
Phillip.

833
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:41,144
Miss Jenny Lind.

834
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,184
WOMAN:
She is luminous.

835
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,984
Who's that?

836
00:44:50,986 --> 00:44:52,888
PHILLIP:
The opera singer?

837
00:44:53,556 --> 00:44:54,892
Singer, huh?

838
00:44:56,024 --> 00:44:59,092
She's the most famous performer
in all of Europe.

839
00:44:59,094 --> 00:45:01,796
She's sold out
La Scala a dozen times.

840
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:04,334
Not to mention
the French Opera.

841
00:45:08,637 --> 00:45:09,906
Ah.

842
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,038
What are you doing?

843
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,074
Following you, so you can
introduce me to Miss Lind.

844
00:45:14,076 --> 00:45:16,075
- Introduce you? I don't know her.
- Yeah.

845
00:45:16,077 --> 00:45:17,544
Everybody knows her.
You just said so yourself.

846
00:45:17,546 --> 00:45:19,411
Yeah, exactly. You don't just
march up to someone like this.

847
00:45:19,413 --> 00:45:21,181
Why not? We're personable.
She's a person.

848
00:45:21,183 --> 00:45:22,952
(Phineas clears throat)

849
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,088
Miss Lind.

850
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:28,524
My name is Phillip Carlyle.

851
00:45:30,492 --> 00:45:33,494
And this extraordinary gentleman
next to me...

852
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:34,993
Phineas Taylor Barnum.

853
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:36,129
The pleasure's mine.

854
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:37,432
Of course,
you are the American.

855
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,199
I believe I might
have heard of you.

856
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:42,701
Oh, well, if you've heard of me
all the way over here

857
00:45:42,703 --> 00:45:44,770
I must be doing something right.

858
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:47,141
That, or something very wrong.

859
00:45:47,143 --> 00:45:50,044
Well, in the world of publicity,
there's hardly a difference.

860
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:53,280
I believe those are the words
of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum.

861
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:56,116
A showman, Miss Lind,
just a showman.

862
00:45:56,118 --> 00:45:58,385
The best on my side
of the Atlantic.

863
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:00,820
Well, if you do
say so yourself.

864
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:04,056
I do, but I don't have to.

865
00:46:04,058 --> 00:46:05,126
- Oh, no. No.
- Right?

866
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:07,127
No, he is one of the best.

867
00:46:07,129 --> 00:46:09,161
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Miss Lind...

868
00:46:09,163 --> 00:46:10,331
let me get to the point.

869
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,767
I'd like to bring you
to New York.

870
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,101
And if you agree, I'll make you
the most famous singer

871
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:16,304
not in Europe,
but in the entire world.

872
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,937
Mmm.

873
00:46:17,939 --> 00:46:20,141
And have you heard me sing?

874
00:46:20,143 --> 00:46:23,009
- Absolutely.
- No. No, I haven't.

875
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:25,813
But like mine,
your reputation precedes you,

876
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:27,747
and, well,
I trust your reputation

877
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:29,783
more than my own taste, so...

878
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:32,486
I've never been to America.

879
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:34,222
You will sing
in the grandest theater

880
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,958
with the finest orchestra
in the greatest city on Earth.

881
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,592
"Jenny Lind.

882
00:46:38,594 --> 00:46:39,892
"One night only."

883
00:46:39,894 --> 00:46:41,128
- (laughs)
- Or maybe two.

884
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,564
And at 20 percent of the gate,

885
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:45,364
it'll be a queen's ransom
for your efforts.

886
00:46:45,366 --> 00:46:47,735
I give most of my earnings
to charity, Mr. Barnum.

887
00:46:47,737 --> 00:46:49,003
To orphans and widows.

888
00:46:49,005 --> 00:46:51,638
"Voice of a Nightingale,
Heart of an Angel."

889
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,672
That's brilliant.

890
00:46:52,674 --> 00:46:54,175
I mean, the press
will go crazy for that story.

891
00:46:54,177 --> 00:46:55,775
That's not a story.

892
00:46:55,777 --> 00:46:57,777
May I ask you something,
Mr. Barnum?

893
00:46:57,779 --> 00:46:59,215
Anything.

894
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,585
Why me?

895
00:47:04,186 --> 00:47:05,452
People come to my show

896
00:47:05,454 --> 00:47:08,423
for the pleasure
of being hoodwinked.

897
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,794
Just once, I'd love to give them
something real.

898
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,733
MAN:
Miss Lind.

899
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:33,648
Everyone is here.
Look at this.

900
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,250
Even the Winthrops.

901
00:47:35,683 --> 00:47:37,353
Are you happy?

902
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:40,219
I will be if this works.

903
00:47:40,221 --> 00:47:43,093
Oh, God. I hope she can sing.

904
00:47:44,993 --> 00:47:46,193
PHINEAS:
What's taking her so long?

905
00:47:46,195 --> 00:47:47,927
They're still
taking their seats.

906
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:49,229
- Speaking of which.
- Yeah?

907
00:47:49,231 --> 00:47:51,032
Tom and Lettie, the others,
they've just arrived.

908
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,267
What?

909
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,300
Where should I put 'em?
Your box?

910
00:47:54,302 --> 00:47:56,603
That box? No, no, no,
that's a bit visible.

911
00:47:56,605 --> 00:47:57,738
Visible?

912
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,273
The acoustics are actually
better in the standing room.

913
00:47:59,275 --> 00:48:00,477
That's where they should be.

914
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:03,076
Miss Lind's ready now.

915
00:48:03,078 --> 00:48:04,548
Okay. Thank you, thank God!

916
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,181
This is so awesome.

917
00:48:08,183 --> 00:48:10,450
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah.

918
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:12,354
- I love it.
- Look at the curtain.

919
00:48:18,427 --> 00:48:20,593

920

(audience quiets)

921
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:28,235
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

922
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:30,036
MAN:
He's out of his element.

923
00:48:30,038 --> 00:48:31,770
MAN #2:
What is this about?

924
00:48:31,772 --> 00:48:33,340
MAN #3:
Is that Barnum?

925
00:48:33,342 --> 00:48:34,710
WOMAN:
This isn't the circus.

926
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,512
I recently had the privilege

927
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:41,249
of hearing the most
divine voice

928
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,383
I've ever heard.

929
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:44,251
Suddenly,
he's a connoisseur.

930
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:47,554
PHINEAS: Now, I know that
sounds like Barnum Humbug...

931
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:49,689
but I have 100 bottles
of good champagne on ice

932
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:52,225
that says this isn't just
another sideshow novelty.

933
00:48:52,227 --> 00:48:55,063
(audience titters)

934
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,730
May I present...

935
00:48:56,732 --> 00:48:58,501
the Swedish Nightingale...

936
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,868

(inaudible)

990
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:50,931
(sound starts)

991
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:52,000
MAN:
Brava!

992
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:54,001
WOMAN:
Brava!

993
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:55,068
More!

994
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:56,437
MAN #2:
Wonderful!

995
00:52:57,071 --> 00:52:58,574
Bravissima!

996
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:00,544
More!

997
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,077
Excellent!

998
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:05,548
MAN #3:
Brava!

999
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:08,481
Encore!

1000
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:11,217
(applause continues)

1001
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:12,719
(pops)

1002
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:14,588
Jenny, this is my wife,
Charity, and our girls.

1003
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,657
Of course, and I've heard
so much about you!

1004
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:19,491
And your father tells me
you're a fan of the ballet.

1005
00:53:19,493 --> 00:53:21,260
Yes, I'm studying ballet.

1006
00:53:21,262 --> 00:53:22,830
Are you?

1007
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:25,432
- Of course, I am.
- And, of course, she is.

1008
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:26,566
And what
about you, Helen?

1009
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:28,203
You look like
a princess, ma'am.

1010
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,369
(all laugh)

1011
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:33,840
I have to admit, Barnum...
she is remarkable.

1012
00:53:33,842 --> 00:53:36,577
Enough to bring joy to the most
joyless critic, isn't she?

1013
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:39,914
Mmm. And in the hands of a
real purveyor of the arts,

1014
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,249
- she could be something in this country.
- (laughs)

1015
00:53:43,251 --> 00:53:45,352
Shame,
she's fallen in with you.

1016
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:47,320
You really are better
on the page, Mr. Bennett,

1017
00:53:47,322 --> 00:53:48,723
hard as that is to believe.

1018
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,190
- WOMAN: Mr. Barnum...
- Yes.

1019
00:53:50,192 --> 00:53:51,724
- I'd love to meet Miss Lind.
- And you will meet Miss Lind.

1020
00:53:51,726 --> 00:53:53,561
- Would you introduce us?
- If you just give me a moment...

1021
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,262
- Phineas.
- Yes.

1022
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:56,831
You've...

1023
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,635
done well.

1024
00:54:00,202 --> 00:54:01,638
Thank you.

1025
00:54:04,606 --> 00:54:06,508
Allow me to introduce you.

1026
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,645
Uh, excuse me, Jenny.

1027
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:13,347
I'd like you to meet
Charity's parents.

1028
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:14,814
Mr. and Mrs. Hallett.

1029
00:54:14,816 --> 00:54:16,050
Ah, pleasure.

1030
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,152
- How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1031
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,487
- Mother.
- Hello, dear.

1032
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:23,289
- (clears throat)
- Are these...

1033
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:25,025
Yes, those are
your granddaughters.

1034
00:54:25,027 --> 00:54:26,193
Phineas, not here.

1035
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:27,193
Not here?

1036
00:54:27,195 --> 00:54:28,727
You afraid I'm gonna
embarrass your parents

1037
00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:30,763
in front of their fancy friends?

1038
00:54:30,765 --> 00:54:32,532
I really don't think
I have that power.

1039
00:54:32,534 --> 00:54:34,834
An insignificant man like me

1040
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:39,006
who was clearly destined
to lead an insignificant life.

1041
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:42,211
All that fortune,
and still just the tailor's boy.

1042
00:54:43,244 --> 00:54:44,681
Get out.

1043
00:54:49,117 --> 00:54:51,850
Well, Phineas...

1044
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:54,621
I believe I told you
that free champagne

1045
00:54:54,623 --> 00:54:56,159
is a recipe for disaster.

1046
00:54:57,058 --> 00:54:58,224
Charity.

1047
00:54:58,226 --> 00:55:02,229
- Now would everyone please raise their glasses?
- Charity.

1048
00:55:02,231 --> 00:55:03,563
To Mr. Barnum...

1049
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:05,365
who has shown
once and for all...

1050
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:08,168
that a man's station
is limited only

1051
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,771
by his imagination.

1052
00:55:11,606 --> 00:55:14,075
- To Barnum! To Barnum!
- Thank you.

1053
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,044
To Mr. Barnum.

1054
00:55:18,446 --> 00:55:20,514
Thank you.

1055
00:55:20,516 --> 00:55:23,151
It's hard to understand
wealth and privilege

1056
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,151
when you're born into it.

1057
00:55:25,153 --> 00:55:26,954
(chuckles)

1058
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:30,260
I sometimes don't feel
like I belong here.

1059
00:55:31,393 --> 00:55:32,961
You?

1060
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,796
I was born out of wedlock...

1061
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:39,067
and that brought
shame upon my family.

1062
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,901
And life always
manages to remind me

1063
00:55:41,903 --> 00:55:43,304
that I don't deserve
a place in this world.

1064
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:47,943
And that leaves a hole that
no ovation can ever fill.

1065
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,713
(boisterous laughter)

1066
00:55:53,882 --> 00:55:55,215
- Mr. Phineas!
- Guys...

1067
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:56,983
Lord, that lady can sing!

1068
00:55:56,985 --> 00:55:57,885
I know.

1069
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,920
Think she likes a man
in uniform?

1070
00:55:59,922 --> 00:56:01,655
I'm sure she does.
Okay, what are you doing here?

1071
00:56:01,657 --> 00:56:03,222
You got a show
in an hour, okay?

1072
00:56:03,224 --> 00:56:05,258
That's enough time for us to have
at least three drinks, right?

1073
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,425
Come on, let's go.

1074
00:56:06,427 --> 00:56:07,960
- No, no, no. Lettie!
- What?

1075
00:56:07,962 --> 00:56:10,799
It's very crowded in here, okay?
And I can't have you mingling...

1076
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:11,665
Guys!

1077
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:12,834
Who's gonna pay admission

1078
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:14,300
if you're out there
for all the world to see?

1079
00:56:14,302 --> 00:56:16,437
- Okay? Have a great show.
- Wait.

1080
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,406
PHINEAS:
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

1081
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:21,342
Jenny, America
may not know it yet...

1082
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,342
but they are going to love you.

1083
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:25,144

PHILLIP: Why can't you just
put more shows in New York?

1171
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,044
Why do you need
to tour the country?

1172
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:18,546
Why did Napoleon
march on Russia?

1173
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:19,746
Napoleon was defeated.

1174
01:00:19,748 --> 01:00:21,981
Napoleon didn't have
a 60-piece orchestra.

1175
01:00:21,983 --> 01:00:23,451
A 60-piece orchestra?

1176
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,952
Just get the cheapest musicians
you can and watch that.

1177
01:00:25,954 --> 01:00:27,188
We'll still have to board them.

1178
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,421
We'll get married ones,
they can share a bunk.

1179
01:00:28,423 --> 01:00:30,557
O'Malley, that's
Caroline's piggy bank.

1180
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,428
- Custom sets? Fireworks?
- Yeah.

1181
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,861
Inside theaters?

1182
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:36,197
That's genius.

1183
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:37,497
No. Hey, P.T...

1184
01:00:37,499 --> 01:00:39,366
These are the most
famous theaters in the country.

1185
01:00:39,368 --> 01:00:41,367
They make you buy the seats
in advance just to book them.

1186
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:42,769
Yeah. I took out a loan.

1187
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:45,339
- And we have to pay Jenny in advance?
- It was a large loan. Okay?

1188
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,939
You're not gonna see
a penny of profit

1189
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:48,441
until your 40th show...

1190
01:00:48,443 --> 01:00:49,610
41st, actually.

1191
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,145
You're risking everything
you've built here.

1192
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,479
How do you think I built it?

1193
01:00:52,481 --> 01:00:54,347
We'll have plenty of profits
to go around after this.

1194
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:55,314
- P.T.?
- What?

1195
01:00:55,316 --> 01:00:57,651
Your attention has been
divided long enough.

1196
01:00:57,653 --> 01:00:58,785
Our gate is down,

1197
01:00:58,787 --> 01:01:00,187
we have more
protesters every day.

1198
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,589
You just need to get people
to come back.

1199
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:03,657
"If you haven't been
to the Barnum Museum lately,

1200
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:05,058
you haven't been
at the Barnum Museum."

1201
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,062
They come to see you.

1202
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:08,795
Your crazy ideas...

1203
01:01:08,797 --> 01:01:11,063
your new acts, the unusual.

1204
01:01:11,065 --> 01:01:13,900
Then how about you show
them a smile? That'd be unusual.

1205
01:01:13,902 --> 01:01:15,269
Keep rehearsing.
Just make it very clear

1206
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,838
I expect them to afford you
all the deference you deserve

1207
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,874
and that they should
be nice to you anyway.

1208
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:23,143
LETTIE: Ain't that a
sight for sore eyes?

1209
01:01:23,145 --> 01:01:24,711
He couldn't even say "hello."

1210
01:01:24,713 --> 01:01:25,845
Or "goodbye."

1211
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:28,248
He's going on tour. Sorry, guys.

1212
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,017
Oh, pull yourself
together, Carlyle.

1213
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,954
Don't you have
somewhere to be?

1214
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,758
Anne Wheeler.

1215
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,497
Mr. Barnum said
he left a ticket for me.

1216
01:01:44,532 --> 01:01:45,767
(clears throat)

1217
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:47,201
I'm sorry.

1218
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,035
I believe there's only
supposed to be one.

1219
01:01:49,037 --> 01:01:51,440
No, there's meant to be two.

1220
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,015
I wasn't sure
you'd come if I asked.

1221
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:04,653
MAN:
Five minutes to curtain.

1222
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,359
I've always wanted
to go to the theater.

1223
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:18,100
MR. CARLYLE:
Phillip, is that you?

1224
01:02:19,266 --> 01:02:20,300
Mother.

1225
01:02:20,302 --> 01:02:24,441
Father.
This is Anne Wheeler.

1226
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,474
Phillip, have you no shame?

1227
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:32,244
Associating yourself with that
Barnum business is one thing...

1228
01:02:32,246 --> 01:02:34,417
but parading around
with the help?

1229
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,286
Anne.

1230
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:40,654
Anne!

1231
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:41,958
Anne!

1232
01:02:47,094 --> 01:02:49,264
How dare you speak
to her like that?

1233
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,800
You forget your place, Phillip.

1234
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:55,834
My place?

1235
01:02:55,836 --> 01:02:57,872
Mother, if this is my place,

1236
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,042
then I don't
want any part of it.

1237
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:11,220
Anne.

1238
01:03:15,123 --> 01:03:17,159
They're small-minded people.

1239
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:25,264
Why do you care what they think?

1240
01:03:25,266 --> 01:03:27,436
It's not just them.

1241
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:30,236
You've never had
somebody look at you

1242
01:03:30,238 --> 01:03:32,073
the way your parents
looked at me.

1243
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,112

First, it was buying a house on
the same street as my parents.

1303
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:37,950
Then, meeting the Queen.

1304
01:07:37,952 --> 01:07:41,488
Then bringing Jenny Lind,
then my father the other night.

1305
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,726
When will it ever
be enough for you?

1306
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,395
I'm doing this
for Caroline and Helen.

1307
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,462
Look around you.
They have everything.

1308
01:07:49,464 --> 01:07:51,064
- You don't understand.
- I do understand.

No, you don't understand.

1310
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:55,672
How could you?

1311
01:07:58,206 --> 01:08:00,674
My father was treated like dirt.

1312
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:05,211
I was treated like dirt,
and my children will not be.

1313
01:08:05,213 --> 01:08:07,716

I'm just another one

Jenny. Jenny, please.

1406
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,708
(sighs)

1407
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:11,114
(applause)

1408
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:29,198
(applause continues)

1409
01:14:30,665 --> 01:14:32,066
Thank you.

1410
01:14:37,405 --> 01:14:39,639
What was that?
(clears throat)

1411
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,878
That was goodbye.

1412
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:48,882
PHILLIP: <i>Hey, thank you
very much for coming.</i>

1413
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,783
- Tell your friends and neighbors!
- What a wonderful show!

1414
01:14:50,785 --> 01:14:52,920
Who enjoyed themselves?
You? You?

1415
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:54,921
Tell everyone how much fun
you had at the circus!

1416
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:56,824
New acts every night!

1417
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:59,962
MAN:
Hey! Ringmaster.

1418
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:04,998
Gentlemen,
gonna have to ask you to leave.

1419
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,501
- This is our town, son.
- (men snickering)

1420
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,868
We think you should leave.

1421
01:15:08,870 --> 01:15:11,237
You and your freaks.

1422
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:12,240
And your spooks.

1423
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:15,144
Sir.

1424
01:15:16,544 --> 01:15:18,278
I will only ask once more.

1425
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,816
Then what, boy?

1426
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,984
Hey! Stop!

1427
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:24,054
Get him!

1428
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:29,456
Charge!

1429
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:32,061
(indistinct yelling)

1430
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:40,936
(grunts, glass shatters)

1431
01:15:50,378 --> 01:15:52,348
(train whistle blows)

1432
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:58,122
- WOMAN: Could that be her?
- MAN: I think so.

1433
01:15:58,754 --> 01:15:59,786
Daddy!

1434
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,688
- (Phineas laughs)
- Daddy!

1435
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:04,822
- Girls, girls, girls!
- Daddy!

1436
01:16:04,824 --> 01:16:07,363
Oh, you've grown so much.
Stop it.

1437
01:16:09,931 --> 01:16:11,764
What made you decide
to come back early?

1438
01:16:11,766 --> 01:16:13,600
I missed you. I missed you.

1439
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:16,135
- That sounds an awful lot like Humbug.
- (bell ringing)

1440
01:16:16,137 --> 01:16:16,970
Fire!

1441
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:18,737
- Move aside!
- Come on!

1442
01:16:18,739 --> 01:16:21,108
Hurry! It's coming
from the circus.

1443
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,710
MAN:
Run! Let's go! Fire!

1444
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:25,481
Girls, stay with me. Come.
Quick, quick!

1445
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,755
Everyone, stay close!

1446
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:35,858
(screaming)

1447
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,162
Phillip! Is everyone out?

1448
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:42,996
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

1449
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,197
The animals? The animals?

1450
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:45,832
Yeah, we set them free.
What else could we do?

1451
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:47,233
W.D., where's Anne?

1452
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:48,570
PHINEAS: Where's Anne?
Where's Anne?

1453
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:51,604
No, Phillip! No!

1454
01:16:51,606 --> 01:16:53,939
Hey! You can't go in there!

1455
01:16:53,941 --> 01:16:56,212
- Anne!
- Phillip!

1456
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,578
Keep pumping!

1457
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:00,613
W.D.!

1458
01:17:00,615 --> 01:17:02,186
Here she is! Here she is!

1459
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,252
PHINEAS:
Phillip!

1460
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:07,890
- Phillip!
- Daddy!

1461
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:12,861
- No, Daddy!
- Daddy!

1462
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:14,831
- Daddy!
- (crowd screaming)

1463
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:18,500
(building groaning)

1464
01:17:26,741 --> 01:17:28,343
Stay back! Please!

1465
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,881
(girl crying)

1466
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,090
Daddy!

1467
01:17:42,123 --> 01:17:44,192
- (gasps)

1468
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:49,866
FIREMAN:
Stretcher!

1469
01:17:50,297 --> 01:17:51,601
Stretcher!

1470
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:53,800
He's taken a lot of smoke.

1471
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,336
He's still breathing. Come on.

1472
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,704
FIREMAN #2:
Come on, let's get him on!

1473
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,374
(coughing)

1474
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:02,178
Up!

1475
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,486

Come on! Straight ahead!

1482
01:19:19,053 --> 01:19:21,190
Thomas, help me break this up.

(coughing)

1484
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:36,973
If you've come to gloat,
I wouldn't.

1485
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:44,177
They caught the thugs
who started the fire.

1486
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:46,682
I thought you'd like to know.

1487
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:53,155
(sighs, clears throat)

1488
01:19:56,824 --> 01:19:59,926
I never liked your show.

1489
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:01,763
But I always thought
the people did.

1490
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,701
They did. They do.

1491
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:11,272
(scoffs)

1492
01:20:12,776 --> 01:20:14,510
Mind you,
I wouldn't call it art.

1493
01:20:15,712 --> 01:20:17,243
Of course not.

1494
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:18,514
But...

1495
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:24,050
putting folks of all kinds
on stage with you...

1496
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:27,987
all colors, shapes, sizes...

1497
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:30,291
presenting them as equals...

1498
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:34,996
Why, another critic
might have even called it

1499
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:37,334
"a celebration of humanity."

1500
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:40,734
I would've liked that.

1501
01:20:40,736 --> 01:20:42,304
Mmm.

1502
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,309
- Well, I hope you'll rebuild.
- Hmm.

1503
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,376
I mean, thank God
for Jenny's tour.

1504
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,347
We can borrow off the profits,
we'll be fine.

1505
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:53,914
You don't know?

1506
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:55,418
Hmm?

1507
01:21:02,925 --> 01:21:04,527
I'm sorry.

1508
01:21:15,638 --> 01:21:16,937
Charity?

1509
01:21:16,939 --> 01:21:18,571
Oh, God, Charity.

1510
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:20,006
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- I am...

1511
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:21,242
Nothing happened.

1512
01:21:21,244 --> 01:21:22,476
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh, sure. Nothing happened.

1513
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:24,043
It's on the cover
of every paper in New York.

1514
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,613
Because she orchestrated the photo.
I'm not in love with her!

1515
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,148
Of course you're not.

1516
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,585
Not with her, not with me,
not with anyone.

1517
01:21:30,587 --> 01:21:31,855
Just you and your show.

1518
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,259
What are you doing?

1519
01:21:37,693 --> 01:21:39,559
I'm going home.

1520
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,830
This is your home.

1521
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,169
The bank...

1522
01:21:47,971 --> 01:21:49,571
they're evicting us.

1523
01:21:51,307 --> 01:21:53,742
Why didn't you ask me before...

1524
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:58,212
I would've said yes.

1525
01:21:58,214 --> 01:22:01,650
I never minded the risk,
but we always did it together.

1526
01:22:04,888 --> 01:22:06,555
(door slams)

1527
01:22:21,936 --> 01:22:23,404
(groans)

1528
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:40,020
(sighs)

1529
01:22:40,022 --> 01:22:42,055
Figured you'd end up here.

1530
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:43,822
Feeling sorry for yourself.

1531
01:22:43,824 --> 01:22:45,360
(door opens)

1532
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:01,841
Folks, if you've
come to get paid,

1533
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:04,444
the money is gone. All of it.

1534
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,345
- Nothing left to give you.
- Shut up, Barnum.

1535
01:23:06,347 --> 01:23:08,284
You just don't get it.

1536
01:23:09,285 --> 01:23:12,321
Our own mothers
were ashamed of us.

1537
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,958
Hid us our whole lives.

1538
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:19,393
Then you pull us
out of the shadows.

1539
01:23:19,395 --> 01:23:21,365
And now you're
giving up on us, too.

1540
01:23:22,699 --> 01:23:24,631
Maybe you are a fraud.

1541
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:27,468
Maybe it was just
about making a buck.

1542
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:32,706
But you gave us a real family.

1543
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:36,279
And the circus...
that was our home.

1544
01:23:39,981 --> 01:23:41,716
We want our home back.

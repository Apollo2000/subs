2
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,958
We had some good times…

3
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,916
…until you ruined everything.

4
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,750
You were the first humans I ever trusted…

5
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,208
And the last.

6
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,125
Speck.

7
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,666
Don't sneak up on someone like that.

8
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,291
What took you so long?

9
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,833
She better be, for your sake.

10
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,583
There's only five days left
until Christmas.

11
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,416
<i>Let me go!</i>

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,583
<i>What are you doing with my camera?</i>

13
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,291
{\an8}<i>But, wow,
I come from a long line of True Believers.</i>

14
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,750
Ugh.

15
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,333
An honest-to-God True Believer.

16
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:26,208
{\an8}Well… I'm about to change all of that.

17
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,791
Track her down.

18
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,666
She's perfect.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,208
{\an8}- Ho ho ho!
- Santa!

20
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,083
{\an8}Merry Christmas.

21
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,666
Ah! Whoo!

22
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,625
Lamest Christmas ever.

23
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

24
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,791
What kind of person would wanna spend
the best holiday of the year

25
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,208
sitting on the hot beach
with fruity umbrella drinks?

26
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,041
Gonna go with just about everybody.

27
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,416
Well, not me.

28
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,708
Not when I could be at home baking cookies

29
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,458
and building snowmen with real snow.

30
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,541
And worst of all,
all my friends are having parties

31
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,291
and shopping, sledding.

32
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,416
I'm missing everything.

33
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,541
Kate, there's nothing
you can do about it, okay?

34
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,791
So you might as well
just relax and try to have fun.

35
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,583
Think I liked you better
when you were a car thief.

36
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,375
I liked you better
when you weren't such a buzzkill.

37
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,208
Ugh, how embarrassing.

38
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,791
- Hey, come on!
- Hey!

39
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,083
Ah!

40
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,666
Oh, so that's what this is about. Bob.

41
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,500
No, this is not about Bob.
I could care less about Bob.

42
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,583
He just brought us here
so he could kiss up to Mom.

43
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,958
Give him a break, Kate.
It means he really likes her.

44
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,666
It's too soon.
They've only been dating for ten months.

45
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,333
And they've known each other
a lot longer than that.

46
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,875
Besides… he makes Mom happy.

47
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,750
Yeah, well, he's not Dad.

48
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,791
<i>Cómo estás,</i> party people?

49
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,291
What are we looking at?

50
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,541
Hey!

51
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,291
Ugh! Now,
there's something you can't unsee.

52
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:48,708
Am I right?

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What are the odds
my dad proposes on this trip?

54
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,875
Or maybe she does.

55
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,208
I mean,
your mom is a pretty progressive woman.

56
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,750
Teddy! I heard they have snorkeling.
You wanna go?

57
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,666
Yeah, one sec.

58
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,333
- You two want to come?
- Nope.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,625
Yeah. Thanks for asking, Teddy,
but I've got horrible anxiety,

60
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,500
asthma, and about 11 different allergies.

61
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,333
All right. Um, well, suit yourselves.

62
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,541
Hey, cheer up, Grinch.

63
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,625
For a True Believer,
you're forgetting the number one rule.

64
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:26,291
"Better not pout."

65
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,416
- Hey, Kate! Wait up!
- Another chocolate smoothie, please.

66
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,000
Make that two.
Can you prepare mine lactose-free?

67
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,166
- Okay.
- Thank you.

68
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,916
- So what should we do?
- "We"?

69
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,833
Oh, I'm gonna hang out by myself,
but why don't you try the waterslide?

70
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,708
- Looks pretty fun.
- And risk breaking my nose?

71
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,875
- It's one of my best features.
- Hey, guys.

72
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,000
They're having a caroling party
on the beach. You wanna join?

73
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,666
- Yeah.
- No, thanks.

74
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,083
Come on, Kate.
I heard you love singing Christmas carols.

75
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,458
Kate has a great singing voice.
She was lead vocalist in the school choir.

76
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,708
In fifth grade.

77
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,666
Really? So was I.

78
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,208
- Really?
- Yeah.

79
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,458
You know, nothing raises
the Christmas Spirit like music.

80
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,333
- Come on. Music?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,458
Did I… Did I do something wrong?

82
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,583
No, it's just…

83
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,125
That was her dad's favorite song.

84
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:39,375
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
- No, of course not. How could you?

85
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,500
She's just being a teenager.

86
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,875
Santa, I know it's probably too late
to write a letter,

87
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,041
and the Wi-Fi here stinks,

88
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,125
but if you're listening,
I want to amend my Christmas wish.

89
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,833
I mean,
the electric scooter would be really cool,

90
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:08,208
but I need something
more important than that right now.

91
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,625
I need to get out of this place.

92
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,958
Mom's basically ditching us
for this new guy and his scaredy-cat son.

93
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,666
It's so depressing.

94
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,416
And in a few weeks,
it's gonna be like Dad never even existed.

95
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,458
So, please, Santa,
help out a True Believer…

96
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,625
Or I swear…

97
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,958
I'm gonna run away.

98
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,583
So, you want to run away, eh?

99
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,000
I think we can make that happen.

100
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,875
Guys, listen. I got some good news.

101
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:51,041
I woke up this morning
with a little magic under the door.

102
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,666
We got some surprises,
compliments of the hotel.

103
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,583
What?

104
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:56,958
First up,

105
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,833
how would you like to mix it up
with manta rays

106
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,875
and tussle with turtles
on a snorkel adventure for two?

107
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,708
Whoa, sounds dope. I know somebody
who would love to go snorkeling.

108
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,375
But that's not all.

109
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:12,541
Two lucky people get an opportunity
to have an overnight stay at Tulum

110
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,541
with a private tour of the Mayan ruins.

111
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,625
Are you serious?

112
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,166
Pack your overnight bags
and bring a sense of adventure.

113
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,916
An overnight in Tulum?
That sounds amazing.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,625
I'm just sayin'.

115
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,791
Listen, the kids are gonna
have the time of their life

116
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,208
because,
while your family is off the resort,

117
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,583
why not stuff your bellies
with free ice cream

118
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,291
and choose
from dozens of fun-filled activities

119
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,916
at the Kids Club at a slumber party?

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,541
Slumber party?

121
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,125
Kate, we're gonna have so much fun.

122
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,541
Wait, but I'm too old
for Kids Club, right?

123
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,625
Um…

124
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,833
Actually, Kate, you just made the cut.

125
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:48,958
You're good.

126
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,041
Lucky you.

127
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:57,166
Wait. This isn't some trick
just to get us out of the way

128
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,916
so you can propose to Mom, is it?

129
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,083
Kate! Sorry.

130
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,666
Okay, first, you make us spend Christmas
on the freaking equator,

131
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,708
and now you don't even
wanna spend it together?

132
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,708
Okay. Excuse us.

133
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,708
Come on.

134
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,500
Why are you acting so rude to Bob?

135
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,875
He's treating us to this incredible trip.
You should try not to forget that.

136
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,000
And you should try not to forget Dad.

137
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:28,375
Look, just because I care for Bob,

138
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,375
and… and I do.

139
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,041
I… I care about him very much…

140
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,500
That doesn't mean
I love your father any less.

141
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,958
Yeah, well,
I just don't see how that's possible.

142
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,000
All right.

143
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,333
Look, I'm just gonna tell Bob
we can't go to Tulum.

144
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,708
We'll just… We'll stay here with you guys.

145
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:53,375
Um, no. Um, actually, um, you should go.

146
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,416
But I can't. I'm not…

147
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,666
I'm not gonna just
leave you here like this.

148
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,416
It's okay, Mom.

149
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,208
I was being a brat.
I don't know what came over me.

150
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,375
You and Bob deserve to have some fun.

151
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:09,333
And I know how much you've been dying
to see those Mayan ruins.

152
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,583
Really?
You honestly feel that way?

153
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,791
I do.

154
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,333
And I promise, you won't have to worry
about me for the rest of the trip.

155
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:22,833
Yeah, hi.

156
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:27,000
I was wondering if you had any more room
on today's flight back to Boston.

157
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,208
Yeah,
I was thinking about ending my trip early.

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,583
I can change it at the airport?

159
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,958
Great. Thanks.

160
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,125
All right, we'll be back
by late afternoon tomorrow.

161
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,250
I know I was talking a big game
this morning, Dad,

162
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,875
but I'm starting to have
second thoughts about this.

163
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:47,125
You sure you need
to be away for a whole day?

164
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,041
Uh… Look, man, all right?

165
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:57,208
I know it's been rough
ever since your mom died.

166
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,166
But we have to keep moving.
We have to keep moving ahead.

167
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:06,541
Plus, I think a little independence
might be good for you.

168
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,041
I just wish we could be independent
in closer proximity.

169
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,125
You got this. Bring it in.

170
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,083
You got this, all right?

171
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,166
- Good?
- Yeah, he's good.

172
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,791
Everybody going to Tulum,
I need your tickets, please.

173
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,041
Oh, all right. You guys, take care.

174
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,291
- Teddy...
- I know, Mom. No alcohol.

175
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,708
Yes, and I was hoping
you could check in on them, please?

176
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,750
Yeah, I… I got it covered. Okay?

177
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,791
- Okay, uh, love you.
- Love you.

178
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,125
- All right. Have fun.
- Okay, guys. See you soon.

179
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,791
You know,
you really don't have to check in on us.

180
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,083
- Yeah, I wasn't planning on it.
- Teddy!

181
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,708
See you tomorrow.

182
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:55,333
Hey, um, Kate! Where are you going?
Kids Club is this way.

183
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,458
Right. Um, yeah.

184
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,333
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

185
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,458
but why don't you go ahead
and head over there,

186
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,750
and I'll meet you in a few?

187
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,291
I'll wait for you.

188
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,708
Go to the Kids Club, Jack.
That is a direct babysitter's order.

189
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,541
You're only three years older than me.

190
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,458
But I believe in a chain of command,

191
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,541
so I'll save you a spot
at the slime-making station.

192
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,416
Hello.
Are you waiting for the airport shuttle?

193
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,541
Yeah.

194
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,541
Driver just popped a tire,
so I'm taking people over in the meantime.

195
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,333
Okay, cool.

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,833
I'm gonna take a little shortcut.
Should get us there in half the time.

197
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,333
Sounds great.

198
00:12:56,416 --> 00:13:00,041
So, I take it by the early checkout,
your vacation isn't going so well.

199
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,833
Ugh, it's complicated. My mom and...

200
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,791
Say no more.

201
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,125
My family was a real drag, too.

202
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,375
Ran away from that nightmare
a couple years ago.

203
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,125
Right around your age.

204
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,291
I just thought it was best for everybody
if I wasn't even here.

205
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,791
They can have their new little family
without me.

206
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:20,708
Kate!

207
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,125
Are you running away?

208
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:27,291
You're supposed to be watching me.

209
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,208
Look, Jack,
don't take this personally or anything…

210
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,833
What is that?

211
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,458
Looks like a wor...

212
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:42,958
Have a nice trip.

213
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,250
Ah.

214
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,250
I don't think we're in Mexico anymore.

215
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,916
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
there aren't any glaciers

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,250
in a 10,000-mile radius
of the Yucatán Peninsula.

217
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,291
This looks like the North Pole!

218
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,750
He heard me.

219
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,833
I knew
I should've brought my puffy jacket.

220
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,833
We're gonna freeze to death out here.

221
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,625
Don't worry, Jack. It's gonna be okay.

222
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,250
He'll come for us… I hope.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,541
Who will come for us?

224
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,083
Dasher!

225
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,791
Ha! Ha!

226
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,250
Thought you'd given up on reindeer.

227
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,125
Let's see if you can handle this!

228
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,708
<i>Help!</i>

229
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,083
<i>Hello?</i>

230
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,750
<i>Somebody</i>,<i> please, help!</i>

231
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,291
Oh.

232
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,291
Wait a minute.

233
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,875
Eh, I guess this is your lucky day,
Yule Cat!

234
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,833
Oh, my.

235
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,583
All right!
Stay with me now, ladies! Back in we go!

236
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,583
We're through! Good work, ladies.

237
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,875
It's good to be back
inside the borealis, my old friend.

238
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,125
As you can see,
Santa fell right into my trap.

239
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,291
The old man's time is coming to an end.

240
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,375
And mine is just beginning.

241
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,416
Stop that.

242
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,708
Oh, dear.

243
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,625
Hmm?

244
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,791
What in the world?

245
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,375
- What's happening?
- Outside the veil, the ice pack.

246
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,083
Nearly frozen.

247
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,583
Oh, dear.

248
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,625
- Jojo, start up some hot chocolate.
- Uh-huh.

249
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,833
And, Hugg, put in some thistle berry,
jitterbug juice,

250
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,625
and Cornish pixie dandruff.

251
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,916
Mm!

252
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,416
Mm-mm!

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,708
Good, good. Enjoy.

254
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,833
Drink.

255
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,875
There you go.

256
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,000
You're gonna be all right, Kate.

257
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,541
How do you know who I am?

258
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,125
Oh, everyone knows
who you are around here.

259
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,208
We've all watched the tape
of your little Christmas adventures

260
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,625
from two years ago.

261
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,958
Are you Mrs. Claus?

262
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:48,916
That's me.

263
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,208
So, does that mean…?

264
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,083
Santa!

265
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,708
Kate Pierce!

266
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,583
- You feeling all right?
- Yeah, I feel fine, but…

267
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,541
Did we just crash through a kaleidoscope?
There were so many different colors.

268
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,833
Oh, no. That was just us
coming back through the Veil of Borealis.

269
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,500
You see, we live under its shield here.

270
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,875
Uh, it keeps us hidden and protected
from the outside world.

271
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,041
But tell me,
how in the name of all things sacred

272
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,875
did you end up
in the middle of the North Pole?

273
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,750
- Wait, you didn't bring me here?
- No, I didn't bring you here.

274
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,125
You're supposed to be in Cancun,
if I'm not mistaken.

275
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,250
Drink.

276
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,750
There you go, sweetie. Do you feel better?

277
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:36,166
Yeah. I feel… really good.

278
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,125
That's some hot chocolate.

279
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,125
My special recipe.

280
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,958
You're just lucky
I was out there hunting Jola the Yule Cat.

281
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,083
Otherwise, I never would have seen you.

282
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,583
But I thought this was,
like, part of your plan.

283
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,375
You know, to grant my Christmas wish.

284
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:52,791
Um…

285
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,708
- The electric scooter?
- No, not the...

286
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,416
I'm talking about the wish. You know…

287
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,250
…the wish.

288
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,958
Yes. Wow, the other wish. Mm-hmm.

289
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:09,208
Yeah. Well, I figured it was a stretch,
so I took matters into my own hands,

290
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:14,208
and I was on my way to the airport
when our shuttle fell into this wormhole.

291
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,833
Wormhole?

292
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,083
Hmm.

293
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,625
- Mina.
- Yeah?

294
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,625
This doesn't look like Kids Club.

295
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,958
What is that thing?

296
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,416
It's okay.
His name is Hugg, and he's an elf.

297
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,041
- An elf?
- An elf.

298
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,250
- So, are those…?
- Mm-hmm.

299
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
And are you…?

300
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,500
Uh-huh.

301
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Then where's…?

302
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,666
Welcome to the North Pole, Jack.

303
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,833
- Are you really…?
- I am.

304
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,333
Uh-uh. No way. I must be dreaming.

305
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:23,208
Oh, you're not dreaming, Jack.
You're in Santa's Village.

306
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,458
The real one.

307
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,625
Nick,
I bet the children would like a tour.

308
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,166
Of the village? A tour?
Of course! Would you?

309
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,625
Are you kidding?
I mean, that would be amazing.

310
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:42,625
Yeah.

311
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,833
Well, then, we'll have to get you
into some warm clothes first.

312
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,416
Wow! Oh.

313
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,083
- This is so cool.
- Yeah.

314
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,833
The village houses
over a million elves.

315
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:13,833
Now, if you combine Amazon,
FedEx, the postal service, and UPS

316
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,583
with every manufacturing company
in the world,

317
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:19,333
and they quadrupled their output
for an entire year,

318
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,125
well, you just might be getting close
to what we can accomplish

319
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,791
here in Santa's Village in a single day.

320
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,333
So, where's your workshop?

321
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,458
Why, you're walking in it.

322
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,708
- Really?
- Yes.

323
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,875
Well, we have over 300,000 shops
here in the village.

324
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,375
And each and every one
designed by Mrs. Claus.

325
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,083
Well…

326
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,166
If she designed this place,

327
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,250
I think it should be called
"Mrs. Claus's Village."

328
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,916
- Me too.
- Why, I… I never thought of that.

329
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,625
- Of course he didn't.
- Uh…

330
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,416
Ah, I mean, I did discover it,
and the elves built it,

331
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,625
but, I don't know,

332
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:57,208
it's been called Santa's Village
for over 1,000 years,

333
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,083
it… it might be time for a change.

334
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:03,208
{\an8}Look who's a movie star.

335
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,875
Come on. Let's go.
I wanna show you something.

336
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:13,291
- You're gonna love it.
- Aha!

337
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,750
Whoa!

338
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,500
Kate! Hello!

339
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,750
This is incredible.

340
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,375
- That's us.
- That's awesome!

341
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:54,000
Katie Cat, Jack, check this out.

342
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,125
It's pretty cool.

343
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,875
You make video games?

344
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:07,750
Oh,
I've been known to code a few in my time.

345
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,166
- Nick.
- Hmm?

346
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,041
What should we show them next?

347
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,541
- Candy canes!
- Kids!

348
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,000
Whoa!

349
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,833
Look up there.

350
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Mm.

351
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,208
Mm!

352
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:48,708
Ah.

353
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:53,000
- Hmm?
- Ah?

354
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,958
Mm-mm!

355
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:58,041
Wow. Look at all those candy canes.

356
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:01,291
Enough to stuff billions
of stockings every year.

357
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:05,416
Mm.

358
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,625
Bjorn!

359
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,708
Ugh!

360
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,041
Bjorn!

361
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:21,916
Oh, now, Kate,
I think you might recognize this place.

362
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,458
- Is that the Hall of Letters?
- Uh-huh.

363
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,750
Wait a minute.
You've been here before?

364
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,666
Well, I've been in there,
but never out here.

365
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,291
How come you never told me?

366
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:33,583
There's a lot of things
I haven't told you, Jack.

367
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:38,416
What is that?

368
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,541
That is the Christmas Star.

369
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,375
It powers up the entire village.

370
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:49,083
I devised a way to connect
the light from the Star of Bethlehem

371
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:52,208
to the borealis,
and that's what creates the veil.

372
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:56,750
And Santa is the only one who knows
how to get in and out of the veil safely.

373
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:01,166
Wait. The light inside the star is
from the real Star of Bethlehem?

374
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,833
Tiny sliver of it.

375
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:05,791
Just as bright and powerful
as the day the elves gave it to me

376
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,041
almost 1,700 years ago.

377
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,583
- 1,700 years ago?
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,041
You're that old?

379
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,833
Mm-hmm. You see, time stands still
here in the North Pole, Jack.

380
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,291
That's why you don't age.

381
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,916
What was that?

382
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,666
That's the cannons.

383
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,875
- Cannons?
- Yeah, it's okay, Jack.

384
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,541
The veil keeps everyone
and everything

385
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:30,208
from getting into the North Pole,
including snow,

386
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:34,208
so the elves have to pipe it in
from the outside. Look.

387
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,500
Wow.

388
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,666
It looks like we're in a giant snow globe.

389
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,583
Yeah.

390
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,666
- What?
- Come on, Jack.

391
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,250
Ah, Nick, look at them.
They're having the time of their lives.

392
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,875
Yes, they are. And so are you.

393
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:25,666
Real children.

394
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,791
It's just been so long.

395
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:34,666
- I'll be sad to see them leave.
- Mm.

396
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,541
Well, we can't send them home

397
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,791
on an empty stomach.

398
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:41,458
- Certainly not.
- That would be rude.

399
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,708
- Oh, very unthoughtful.
- We can't have that.

400
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,416
No. No. Well, then it's decided.

401
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,791
They'll come for dinner,
and then you'll take them back.

402
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:50,375
Exactly what I was thinking.

403
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:53,416
And I have to prepare.
Oh, I have to prepare.

404
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,541
- Jojo.
- Uh-huh?

405
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,708
I need corn for popping.

406
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,291
Uh, three French hens,

407
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:01,666
a partridge, a pear, and figgy pudding!

408
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,958
Ooh, figgy pudding.

409
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,583
Ah.

410
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:08,333
All right.

411
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,166
Ah. Ooh.

412
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,250
Wow!

413
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,250
- This is dinner?
- Uh-huh.

414
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:17,833
Prepared by the North Pole's
executive chef, Mrs. Claus.

415
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:20,291
Well, a little something
I whipped up last minute.

416
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,041
Okay, let's sit down.

417
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:26,583
- You're over here, Kate.
- I don't know, Mrs. Claus.

418
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:27,791
My dad's really strict

419
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:31,208
about me eating my protein and vegetables
before I have dessert.

420
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:34,250
Well, as he should be,
but this isn't dessert.

421
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,250
It's not?

422
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:39,333
No, everything on this table
is super healthy for you.

423
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,750
How is that possible?

424
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,041
Well, I've created some new recipes.

425
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,583
Recipes that make all the food you hate

426
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,125
look and taste like all the food you love.

427
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,458
Wow.

428
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,416
Would you like some broccoli?

429
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,750
This is the most delicious thing
I've ever tasted!

430
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,500
All right!

431
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:08,083
Well, now, don't miss
the lima beans and carrots.

432
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,166
Wow!

433
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:13,541
So…

434
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,708
…I've been thinking…

435
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:19,708
About how you got here.

436
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,791
All this business
about coming through a wormhole.

437
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,583
It's true.
It was just like on your sleigh.

438
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:29,583
Only, instead of a sleigh,
it was a golf cart.

439
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,500
Hmm.

440
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:31,625
- Nick?
- Hmm?

441
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:35,708
I have a feeling this has something to do
with Kate being a True Believer.

442
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:37,208
Hmm.

443
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,916
Yeah. What if it means
that I'm supposed to live here

444
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,541
with you guys in the North Pole?

445
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:44,958
Excuse me?

446
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:48,250
Come on, Santa. I already speak Elvish,
I've been on the big ride,

447
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,875
and I could bring a fresh perspective
to the whole operation.

448
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,833
When did this turn into a job interview?

449
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:55,916
Please, Santa.

450
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,291
Anything would be better than going home
to my mom and her boyfriend.

451
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,333
I'm sitting right here, you know.

452
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:05,333
I'm sure your mother loves you very much.

453
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,916
More than you can ever imagine.

454
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,541
I don't know, Mrs. Claus.

455
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:13,500
You should've seen how fast she ditched me
for those stupid Mayan ruins.

456
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,916
She's right about that.

457
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,666
And besides, our parents
aren't even gonna get back to the resort

458
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,125
until tomorrow afternoon.

459
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,250
Hmm.

460
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:24,958
Come on, Santa, let us stay.
Even just for a little bit?

461
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,333
Hmm. Um…

462
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:29,125
Mrs. Claus?

463
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:34,041
Well, it would be
so nice having children here…

464
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,541
If only just for one night.

465
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:43,791
- Please, Santa. Let us stay.
- We'll be good. I promise.

466
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,750
- Just for one night. Please?
- Come on.

467
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:49,041
Well, I don't…
I don't see the harm in it, but, uh…

468
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:52,583
- Oh, why not? Absolutely.
- Yes!

469
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:54,416
Thank you, Santa.

470
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,625
But then first thing in the morning,
it's right back to Cancun, huh?

471
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,375
Mrs. Claus's Village
is the best place on earth!

472
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,458
Oh!

473
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,333
So, Mina,
this is what you get for spying on me.

474
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,208
Speck,
bring me the rest of my toys.

475
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,625
Ah. Okay.

476
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,250
You know what to do.

477
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:48,375
In a few hours, this entire village
will be nothing but a distant memory.

478
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,291
Good night, sweet Jack.

479
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,291
Good night, Mrs. Claus.

480
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,250
Sleep tight.

481
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,083
Oh!

482
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,750
Sweetheart, sleep tight.

483
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,333
Good night, Mrs. Claus.

484
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:09,041
<i>The Christmas Chronicles</i>?

485
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,208
Jack!

486
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:17,041
I wouldn't touch those if I were you.
They look pretty rare.

487
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:20,750
- Yes, they are very rare.
- Oh, they're one of a kind, actually.

488
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,500
Would you like to hear a bedtime story?

489
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:27,000
- Man, that would be awesome!
- That'd be amazing.

490
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,958
Oh, okay.

491
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:32,375
Well, here. Come on, follow me.

492
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,916
Well, have a cozy winter's nap, children.

493
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,125
Good night, Santa.

494
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:41,708
Sweet dreams.

495
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:44,916
- Good night, Santa Claus.
- You know, you can just call him Santa.

496
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:49,958
All right, now. Here we go.

497
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:55,083
So, yeah. Okay.

498
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,708
Look closely, children.

499
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:01,416
Very,

500
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,083
very closely.

501
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,875
This is where it all began.

502
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:09,416
<i>Back in 312 AD.</i>

503
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,000
<i>Santa was living</i>
<i>in Asia Minor. Today, it's called Turkey.</i>

504
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,458
<i>Santa was known as Saint Nicholas.</i>

505
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:22,041
<i>He was a bishop</i>
<i>who discovered the joy of giving.</i>

506
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,375
<i>Became something of a local hero.</i>

507
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:32,791
<i>And his legend spread far and wide,
eventually reaching the Forest Elves.</i>

508
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,333
Wait, you mean
there are different kinds of elves?

509
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:41,000
Oh, of course. They're an ancient species
of very magical and wild creatures.

510
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:44,166
For centuries, they were hunted
for their magical powers,

511
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,125
<i>and then they were captured by humans
to the brink of extinction.</i>

512
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,750
That's awful.

513
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,041
Oh, it was.

514
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,083
But in elf lore,

515
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,500
there was a prophecy

516
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:05,041
about a man
who would be king of the elves,

517
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,791
who would, one day, lead them to safety.

518
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:13,833
Their leader, Hakan,
knew that Saint Nicholas was the only one

519
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:16,708
<i>who could channel
the Star of Bethlehem's power.</i>

520
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,208
<i>From that day forward,</i>

521
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:22,125
<i>they no longer referred to him
as Saint Nicholas.</i>

522
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:26,208
<i>They called him Santa Claus.</i>

523
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,208
<i>And he led the elves</i>
<i>on a mystical journey</i>

524
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:33,666
<i>to an unknown land,
where Christmas would truly endure.</i>

525
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:36,708
<i>That's here. That's the North Pole.</i>

526
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,666
<i>Yes.</i>

527
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,916
Weird. That one elf,

528
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,250
he looks kinda familiar.

529
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:46,708
Yeah.

530
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,666
Hmm.

531
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,208
Belsnickel.

532
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:51,791
Here.

533
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,000
Whoa!

534
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:00,958
Okay.

535
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:05,291
Now…

536
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:09,125
{\an8}Belsnickel was a precocious
and brilliant elf

537
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,750
who was very popular here in the village.

538
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:14,458
<i>I taught him the art
of magical potion-making,</i>

539
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,375
<i>and Santa taught him the art of invention.</i>

540
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:18,916
Ooh.

541
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:24,333
Hey. Okay.

542
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,833
Uh-huh.

543
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:29,166
Wow.

544
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,166
Oh.

545
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,166
<i>We had so many good times together.</i>

546
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,958
<i>Santa and I grew
to love him very, very much.</i>

547
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:43,166
But, by the time Belsnickel
became a teenager, everything changed.

548
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,291
The spirit of Christmas
had grown around the world.

549
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,500
Santa had less time for Belsnickel,

550
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:53,583
so Belsnickel became resentful
of Santa, and more rebellious.

551
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:57,541
Until, one day, he broke the Elves' Code.

552
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,500
What's the Elves' Code?

553
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:03,541
Ego, lying, viciousness,

554
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:06,000
envy, and selfishness.

555
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:10,041
And if an elf commits
every single one of those transgressions,

556
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,000
they become cursed.

557
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,458
And Belsnickel, well, he broke all five.

558
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,625
He became a very naughty boy.

559
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,208
Ew!

560
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:38,125
Blech!

561
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:42,916
<i>And he kept getting naughtier…</i>

562
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,000
<i>…and naughtier.</i>

563
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,458
Mm-hmm.

564
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,833
- Enjoy.
- Very nice. Hmm.

565
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,041
Oh.

566
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,875
Ah.

567
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,833
- Belsnickel! What is this?
- Ah.

568
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:20,000
I build all the best toys around here.
It's about time I get some of the credit.

569
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,833
<i>And when he broke the final transgression,</i>

570
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:28,875
<i>Belsnickel was stripped
of the joy of being an elf.</i>

571
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,375
Belsnickel!

572
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:31,625
What are you doing?

573
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,083
Why would you do that?

574
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:37,333
Because you care more
about children all over the world

575
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,791
than you care about me.

576
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:44,583
<i>And with that, he transformed</i>
<i>into the thing he despised the most,</i>

577
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,625
<i>a human.</i>

578
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,375
Ah!

579
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:51,583
Ah! Oh!

580
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,958
Oh, oh! Ah!

581
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:06,375
<i>Clouded by anger and humiliation…</i>

582
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:08,916
- No, no, no! Wait, wait!
- Belsnickel, come back!

583
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,916
<i>…Belsnickel ran away from the village…</i>

584
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:13,500
Never to return.

585
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,125
He was a naughty little elf…
but I miss him.

586
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:22,791
Okay.

587
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:26,041
That's about enough for tonight.

588
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:28,416
We get up at the crack of dawn
around here.

589
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,458
Good night, Mrs. Claus.

590
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:32,166
- Good night, Mrs. Claus.
- Good night, children.

591
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,541
Good, everyone's going to sleep.

592
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,083
It's time.

593
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,791
I can't wait to see
what's gonna happen

594
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,875
when the elves get
a snootful of this stuff.

595
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:07,458
Ah, this is gonna be fun.

596
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:12,041
Now, only one small scoop
into each cannon.

597
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:13,416
Mm-hmm.

598
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:20,125
Bye-bye!

599
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:23,416
Ah! Ooh! Whoa.

600
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,333
You take care of the reindeer.

601
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:32,500
I'll get the star.

602
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:41,875
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

603
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,208
Aha.

604
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:48,416
Ooh.

605
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:51,125
Jola?

606
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,250
Oh! Oh, Dasher?

607
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:06,333
Ooh.

608
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:33,291
- The cannons!
- What? In the middle of the night?

609
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:36,791
Oh.

610
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:40,541
Oh!

611
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,333
That doesn't look like snow.

612
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:52,166
- Jola?
- Oh!

613
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:56,166
I don't know.

614
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,291
Jola better not be in the stables!

615
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:04,541
- What's happening?
- Something about the stables. Let's go.

616
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,041
Ooh!

617
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:39,625
Oh.

618
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:45,583
Oh, my goodness.

619
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,791
Dasher.

620
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,375
Easy, girl.

621
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,083
I know, baby. I know.

622
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,666
Easy, girl.

623
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,958
Oh.

624
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:36,750
Nick.

625
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,166
It's him.

626
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:42,500
The star!

627
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,083
Belsnickel!

628
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,375
Hello, Santa.

629
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,416
Missing something?

630
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,500
You've played a lot of nasty tricks
in your time, Belsnickel,

631
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:01,708
but sending Jola into the stables?

632
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:02,666
Big deal.

633
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,125
So, he scared the reindeer,
and they ran off into the forest.

634
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,666
He attacked Dasher!

635
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:11,458
- That wasn't supposed to happen.
- Well, it did.

636
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,958
- Hey, is that him?
- She's very badly wounded.

637
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:17,375
So… it <i>was</i> you.

638
00:45:18,208 --> 00:45:19,458
Hello, Mrs. Claus.

639
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,916
My apologies for any inconvenience.

640
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,708
Inconvenience?

641
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,250
Dasher is fighting for her life!

642
00:45:28,333 --> 00:45:30,541
Belsnickel, how could you?

643
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,166
That's Belsnickel…

644
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:34,666
From the story.

645
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,708
- Mm-hmm.
- I knew I recognized him.

646
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:40,000
That's the guy who drove the shuttle
back in Cancun.

647
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,833
- Yeah.
- Yep.

648
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,083
And I gotta thank you, Kate,
because, without you,

649
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:46,541
I never could have got
back inside Santa's Village.

650
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:49,250
That's Mrs. Claus's Village to you!

651
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,833
That's… That's not official.

652
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,333
Well, folks,
this little family reunion's been sweet,

653
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:59,625
but it's time for me to leave.

654
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:03,083
Not until that star is back on the tree.

655
00:46:04,541 --> 00:46:06,291
Agreed, but not this tree.

656
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,791
This star's for my tree
back at the South Pole.

657
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:12,250
Ooh, it's gonna be the shiz.
I am starting a new village.

658
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,791
I can see it now. "Belsnickel's Village."

659
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,958
- There's gonna be another village?
- You bet there is.

660
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,083
And I'm gonna round up
my own band of elves,

661
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:22,833
and I'm gonna invent my own stuff,
really cool stuff,

662
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:25,958
that will make everybody forget
that the North Pole

663
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,458
and Santa Claus ever existed.

664
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:32,250
Oh, here we go.
Pout, pout, pout!

665
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:33,291
Whatever.

666
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:38,375
I am taking the star to the South Pole
so I can stop aging and buy some time

667
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:41,541
to figure out a way
to break this awful curse.

668
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,875
What's so bad about being human?

669
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,083
Humans suck!

670
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,416
Elves rule.

671
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,208
And I am tired of being a human!

672
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:54,500
Belsnickel, there's only one way
to break the curse,

673
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:57,375
and that's for you
to come back home to the village

674
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:59,000
and embrace your family.

675
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,916
I know that deep down inside…

676
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,125
It's what you want.

677
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:09,708
Bah, humbug!

678
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:12,875
You watch your mouth, young elf!

679
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,083
Hi. Thank you.

680
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:26,083
How do you like my new gravity glove?

681
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,500
Not bad, kid.

682
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:32,291
But it's no match for real magic.

683
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,458
Give it up, Bels.

684
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:36,541
Not a chance.

685
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,083
The only thing you ever cared about
was your stupid holiday.

686
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,375
That stupid holiday

687
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:43,375
makes billions of people
feel love and happiness.

688
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,375
Well, I'm about to change all of that.

689
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:46,916
Change, ha!

690
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,916
You couldn't handle
any of the little changes

691
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,458
that were going on around here,
so you ran away.

692
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:55,625
Because you spend every hour of every year
getting ready for one lousy day.

693
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:58,833
A day that brings joy
to children all over the world,

694
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:01,541
and that will never change.

695
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,500
Oh!

696
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:10,541
Belsnickel, stop!

697
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:12,750
Nick!

698
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:19,041
Oh!

699
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,541
Belsnickel, what have you done?

700
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,125
This is…

701
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:58,000
This is bad.

702
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,291
Without the star,

703
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:04,166
the North Pole, the village,
Christmas itself is doomed!

704
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:06,416
Like, for this year?

705
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,333
Like, forever.

706
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:11,125
You're right. This is bad.

707
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,916
But we can't let that happen.

708
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,500
Christmas must endure.

709
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,708
To the stables.

710
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,291
Hugg, don't you...

711
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,458
- Elf Bane.
- Oh, dear!

712
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,875
What's going on?

713
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:52,291
The elves have been poisoned by Elf Bane.

714
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:56,208
It drives them insane.
They become reckless, dangerous maniacs.

715
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:58,375
Belsnickel spiked the cannons!

716
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:15,791
- Inside!
- Come, let's... All right.

717
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:17,416
- Go, Jack.
- Okay.

718
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,916
Here. Come on. Hurry up.

719
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,708
Okay.

720
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:32,333
Oh, Dash.

721
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:36,083
Can you heal her?

722
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:38,000
I'll try my best.

723
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:40,083
I also have to find a cure for Elf Bane.

724
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:42,375
- And I need to get to Turkey.
- Turkey?

725
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,625
I need to find Hakan and the Forest Elves.

726
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:48,083
They're the ones that can build
a new star for me to reignite.

727
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:50,625
But, Nick, you've never flown
with only seven reindeer.

728
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:53,000
I know, I know.
And you can't work on Dasher

729
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,083
and find a cure for Elf Bane by yourself.

730
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:56,250
Jack will help me.

731
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,250
He will?

732
00:50:57,833 --> 00:50:59,166
Should I stay here, too?

733
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,041
No, no, I need you to come with me.

734
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:02,000
Why?

735
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:05,666
Well, with only seven, I'm not even sure
we can get the sleigh off the ground.

736
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,083
I'm gonna need
all the help I can get, Kate.

737
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,333
Hurry back.

738
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:15,666
Work your magic, Mrs. Claus.

739
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:24,416
On, Dasher! On, uh, Dancer!

740
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,708
On, Comet. On, Comet!

741
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,958
Uh, Vixen!

742
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:43,916
Santa, what about
all the presents you need to deliver?

743
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,208
Christmas is only three days away.

744
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:50,000
- Without Dasher, how are we...
- Like I said, it's a challenge.

745
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,416
But, you see, they're… they're improving.

746
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:59,166
As long as their Christmas Spirit
stays high, we should be okay.

747
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:02,666
I'm so sorry, Santa.
If I hadn't have just...

748
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,416
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

749
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,708
This is not your fault, Katie Cat.

750
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:10,125
Believe me, that tricky little elf
was gonna find his way

751
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,041
into the village one way or another.

752
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:14,375
Well, what's he gonna do now?

753
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:18,500
Oh, he's probably trying to figure out
some way to beat us to Turkey.

754
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:21,375
- But why?
- Well, to stop me from getting a new star.

755
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,291
That's not gonna happen.

756
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:26,375
Because he's not taking
one thing into consideration.

757
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:27,666
What's that?

758
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,791
He can't possibly get there
as fast as we can,

759
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:32,416
no matter what he does.

760
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:38,750
You underestimate me, old man,
just like you always do.

761
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:49,500
We need to find a way
to get the elves back to normal.

762
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,041
Okay. Now…

763
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,625
Elf, elf flu…

764
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:56,250
Elf-bin…

765
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:58,833
Here it is, Elf Bane.

766
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:01,375
- Oh, dear.
- What?

767
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:03,083
It only has one known cure.

768
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:08,000
- "Levande Root"?
- It's a rare Arctic flower.

769
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:11,000
And there's only one place
that it grows around here.

770
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:16,375
Okay. Now, follow this path

771
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:19,666
through the forest,
and it will lead you to the Levande Root.

772
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:23,250
Okay, but you're coming with me, right?

773
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,500
No, I need to stay here with Dasher.

774
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:33,500
But, Mrs. Claus,
isn't it kinda dangerous out there?

775
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:37,416
It can be, but that's true of any place.

776
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:39,750
You can do this, Jack.

777
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:41,708
I won't let anything happen to you.

778
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:44,958
I'll be watching you the entire time.

779
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:46,625
And I'm arming you…

780
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:48,708
With these.

781
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,375
You're arming me with cookies?

782
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:54,208
Well, they're not just any old cookies.

783
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:57,250
Okay, the gingerbread man cookie explodes

784
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:58,833
when you throw it,

785
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:01,791
and the snowman cookie gives you courage.

786
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:06,375
Well, you have to move fast.

787
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:08,583
We don't have a moment to lose.

788
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:10,708
Wait. Hold on.

789
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,583
Whoo! Yeah!

790
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,583
My goodness.

791
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:37,708
Ooh!

792
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:43,583
You're never gonna get
past those elves.

793
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:44,833
Okay.

794
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:51,291
I just baked a whole batch of cookies!

795
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:52,958
- Cookies?
- Who's hungry?

796
00:54:53,041 --> 00:54:55,500
Cookie, cookie, cookie!

797
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:01,500
Cookie!

798
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,916
That will distract them
for about 30 seconds.

799
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,125
- Got it.
- Now… there.

800
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:10,041
Okay.

801
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,708
Now's your chance, Jack.

802
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:17,291
It's pretty cold out there.

803
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:19,166
What if I get frostbite?

804
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,000
Oh, don't worry about frostbite.

805
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:24,625
I'm an expert
at reattaching fingers and toes.

806
00:55:25,916 --> 00:55:27,708
Now, hurry.

807
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:30,708
Jack!

808
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:35,166
Be my hero.

809
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,583
My mom used to say
the same thing to me.

810
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,833
Okay. It's hero time.

811
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:10,458
This is not what I expected Turkey
to look like at all.

812
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:12,875
Ah, you're on hallowed ground here, Kate.

813
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:17,625
You're about to witness something
that no one else on earth

814
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,291
has ever seen before.

815
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,666
Shh!

816
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,500
What was that?

817
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:40,000
- Uh, Santa?
- What?

818
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You've been shot.

819
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:42,916
What?

820
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:46,166
Hmm.

821
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:49,125
Well, don't you feel anything?

822
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:52,500
Nah, riding around in the sleigh
is like a shot of novocaine

823
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,166
in the old butt cheek sometimes.

824
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:39,458
Wow.

825
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,125
You believe this guy?

826
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:51,875
Ah, ah, ah!

827
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,958
Ooh!

828
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:55,458
Uh-oh.

829
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,333
Hmm.

830
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,666
Why don't they recognize you?

831
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,958
Oh, they're just kids.

832
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:10,958
Look at 'em.

833
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:14,916
Can't be more than... What?
Two, three hundred years old?

834
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,875
They've never seen me.

835
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,625
I haven't been back here in,

836
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:22,500
oh, I don't know,
maybe 500 years.

837
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:26,458
Five hundred and twenty-two,
to be exact, Nicholas.

838
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:29,083
Hakan.

839
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:32,416
You look well and wise.

840
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,916
You as well, Nicholas.

841
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,083
Who's your friend?

842
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:42,000
Hmm.
Your Elvish is impressive.

843
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:43,791
So is your English.

844
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:45,125
Thank you.

845
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:48,958
So, what brings you both here?

846
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:53,666
- Belsnickel.
- Oh. What's he done now?

847
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:56,375
Destroyed the Christmas Star.

848
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:05,208
Well, we can build a new container.

849
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:07,500
But only you, Nicholas,

850
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:11,916
can harness the power
of the Star of Bethlehem.

851
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:16,250
And as you know,
the ritual is very dangerous.

852
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,625
We have no other choice.

853
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,458
We must move quickly.

854
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:04,750
That is really high.

855
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:17,333
Okay. Which one
did she say gives you courage,

856
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:18,791
and which one explodes?

857
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,833
I'm gonna go with the gingerbread man.

858
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,875
No, no, it's the snowman…

859
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:27,625
I think.

860
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,375
I hope I don't blow up.

861
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:40,500
All right, let's do this.

862
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:10,458
Thank you, Hakan.

863
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,958
Thank <i>you,</i> Santa Claus.

864
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:15,500
Now, hurry back to the North Pole.

865
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:17,708
Christmas must endure.

866
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:22,708
Right, then, Kate. No time to lose.
Hold on to this.

867
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:41,833
Here, kitty, kitty.

868
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:44,208
Would you like a treat?

869
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,958
That's right. You better run.

870
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:56,333
There's a new sheriff in town,
and his name is Jack Booker.

871
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:02,416
Looks like the reindeer
are doing a lot better.

872
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,166
You bet. Homeward bound!

873
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,666
Hyah!

874
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:08,458
Holy jingle bells!

875
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:11,541
Ah, you really didn't think
I was just gonna disappear, did you?

876
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:14,458
What in the world is that?

877
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:16,875
It's my new ride.

878
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:20,416
Doesn't exactly scream aerodynamic.

879
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:26,208
What do you call those?

880
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:29,666
- It's my team of jackalotes.
- Jack-a-what?

881
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:33,958
Jackal and coyote hybrid.
My creation. Pretty cool, huh?

882
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:35,958
They're a long way from cool.

883
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:39,833
But you are clever, Belsnickel.
I'll give you that.

884
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:43,333
Just not clever enough
to beat me.

885
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:44,375
Wanna bet?

886
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:48,208
Oh, no! The star!

887
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:49,291
Dive!

888
01:05:00,416 --> 01:05:02,583
Hold on tight!

889
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:07,958
Come on, girls!

890
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:14,541
Whoo!

891
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,083
Why did we stop?

892
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:19,541
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

893
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:21,500
There's something wrong
with my instruments.

894
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:24,291
I gotta do something, fast.

895
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:27,291
We need to get that star back
from Belsnickel!

896
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,708
Bon voyage!

897
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:34,541
Whoo-hoo! You feel that, everybody?

898
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,916
That's a world without Santa Claus.

899
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:40,791
That's my good girl. Drink it up.

900
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,500
Drink it up.

901
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:49,291
Good girl.

902
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:53,541
Ow!

903
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,000
I made it!

904
01:05:57,083 --> 01:06:00,333
- Never doubted you for a moment.
- That makes one of us.

905
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:01,666
You think this'll work?

906
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,708
If it doesn't, we lose the elves forever.

907
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:05,708
Let's go.

908
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,833
Where are we?

909
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:18,250
You mean, "<i>When </i>are we?" Look!

910
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:22,458
I think, somehow, we've gone back in time.

911
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:23,916
Back in time?

912
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,166
Wait a minute, Boston.

913
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:29,208
Logan International Airport,
Christmas Eve.

914
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:30,166
It's not good.

915
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:31,083
Why not?

916
01:06:31,166 --> 01:06:32,625
Well, during the holidays,

917
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:36,125
airports have some of the lowest
Christmas Spirit in the world.

918
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:37,791
Right now, this one's at…

919
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:41,500
…7% and dropping.

920
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:44,166
Well, what happens
if Christmas Spirit gets down to zero?

921
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,958
The reindeer won't be able to fly at all.
Now, look at them. They're exhausted.

922
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:52,458
All right. Hold on tight.
Okay, I'm gonna have to bring her down.

923
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:55,041
Now, this… this might get a little rough.

924
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:25,250
- Are they gonna be okay?
- This is worse than I thought.

925
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,041
Oh.

926
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,083
{\an8}- Oh, no.
- What?

927
01:07:36,166 --> 01:07:38,416
We just opened a tear
in the fabric of time.

928
01:07:38,916 --> 01:07:41,958
- Those wormholes won't stay open for long.
- How much time do we have?

929
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:44,750
Uh, 11, 12 minutes, at the most.

930
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:47,625
Which means
if we don't get Christmas Spirit up soon…

931
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,791
We're stuck here forever.

932
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:58,333
Bingo!
There's the guilty culprit, right here.

933
01:07:58,416 --> 01:08:00,916
- What is it?
- Ah, some kind of time twister.

934
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,375
Looks like Belsnickel figured out
a rudimentary form of time travel.

935
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:07,000
You gotta admire his work.

936
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:11,416
But, as usual, it's also got
his signature shoddy craftsmanship.

937
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:14,041
And looks like it's out of juice.

938
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:16,541
You need to find a power source for that.

939
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:19,625
I need to get Christmas Spirit
up and running again.

940
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:28,208
<i>Attention, all passengers,</i>

943
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,750

<i>- Oh.</i>

944
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:37,125
<i>I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

945
01:08:37,208 --> 01:08:39,833
<i>I have been informed that this flight
has been delayed for an hour.</i>

946
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:40,916
<i>Sorry about this delay.</i>

947
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,833
I think I found out
what this thing runs on.

948
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:44,666
Triple-A batteries.

949
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:48,166
Only Belsnickel could power
a time machine with triple-As.

950
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,291
All right, let's see what I've got here.

951
01:08:51,375 --> 01:08:53,666
Yeah. There we go.

952
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:55,791
- These are expired.
- What?

953
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:58,750
That's all I've got.

954
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:05,666
- The gift shop. They'll have some there.
- Yeah. Good thinking. All right.

955
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,833
You go get 'em and then meet me
right back here. All right?

956
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:13,250
All right.

957
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:16,833
Let's see what we have to play with here.

958
01:09:16,916 --> 01:09:20,375
<i>Attention on the concourse.</i>

<i>Please remain in the boarding area</i>
<i>for further information.</i>

963
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:28,750
Three dollars, please.

964
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,958
Here you go. Keep the change.

965
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:34,333
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Hmm?

966
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:36,000
Is this Monopolymoney?

967
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:37,250
No, that's real.

968
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:41,125
This is the worst counterfeit job
I've ever seen.

969
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:44,666
- It says 2020.
- Oh.

970
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:47,500
I bet they won't even be
using paper money in 30 years.

971
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,708
- Um, right. Um, my mistake. Sorry.
- Hey, you gotta pay for those batteries.

972
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:53,458
What's goin' on here, young lady?

973
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:57,166
Where are your parents?

974
01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:01,375
Oh, they're…
they're cool with me traveling alone.

975
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:04,666
Hmm. Can I see your boarding pass, please?

976
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:11,125
You know what? I must have dropped it
over there. Uh, I'll go get it.

977
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,000
You know what? Hey!
Why don't you come with me?

978
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:16,791
- What? No, please.
- Look, kid, you got no ticket, no parents.

979
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:21,125
- For all I know, you could be a runaway.
- But I'm not a… Not exactly.

980
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:24,250
You know what?
Just page Santa Claus. You'll see.

981
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,291
Page Santa Claus.

982
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:27,125
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

983
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,625
Okay.

984
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:44,250
<i>All passengers</i>
<i>bound for New York's JFK on flight 611,</i>

985
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:47,250
<i>we regret to inform you
that your flight has been canceled.</i>

986
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,833
<i>We will continue to keep you updated
as new flights are scheduled.</i>

987
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:51,666
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

988
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:54,791
I'm sorry, everyone.
I don't have good news.

989
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,916
All flights have been canceled!

990
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,416
What? Five minutes ago,
you said there'd be a 30-minute delay.

991
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,250
And now that flight has been canceled.

992
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:05,750
So you're telling me
you didn't know five minutes ago

993
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:08,125
that it was a cancellation
and not a delay?

994
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:10,500
I <i>am </i>telling you.

995
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:15,875
Listen, we can offer you
a complimentary hotel room for the night.

996
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:17,833
I don't want a free hotel room!

997
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:21,375
I want a flight to Chicago, right now!

998
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:27,583
Time to go to work.

999
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,958
Now, listen, brothers and sisters.

1000
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:40,625
We ain't going nowhere

1001
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:42,583
with all this negativity.

1002
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:47,000
All this fussin' and fightin'

1003
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:49,541
ain't nothing but stupidity.

1004
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:54,541
I've been listening
to this noise and nonsense

1005
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:56,333
all night and day.

1006
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:01,875
Now, let's hear
what the man with the plan has to say.

1007
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:04,208
Go on, honey.

1008
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:07,458
Tell them what it is we need.

1009
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,250
Well, what we need is, uh…

1010
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,875
Well, it's real simple.

1011
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,250
All we need is, uh…

1012
01:12:20,708 --> 01:12:22,333
…the spirit of Christmas!

1013
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:27,375
Perhaps I should explain a little further.

1014
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:42,541
Hey, Grinch.

1015
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:47,000
Don't look so down in the dumps.
Christmas is tomorrow, after all.

1016
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:49,000
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

1017
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,500
Sometimes, I just don't get people.

1018
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:54,458
A little snag in their plans,
and suddenly, the sky is falling.

1019
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:58,583
Santa will find a way
to make it all work out. He always does.

1020
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,083
For good little boys and girls.

1021
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:04,500
I'm starting to wonder
if I fall into the other category.

1022
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,208
Not a chance.

1023
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:08,333
I know another True Believer
when I see one.

1024
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:13,250
Wait, you know about True Believers?

1025
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:15,291
I come from a long line of them.

1026
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:17,791
That's why I know that,
by this time tomorrow,

1027
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:19,208
I'm gonna be in Miami.

1028
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:21,833
Nothing better than spending Christmas
on the beach, if you ask me.

1029
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:25,625
Sounds like you'd get along
with the rest of my family.

1030
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,750
Christmas in the tropics
just isn't for me.

1031
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:30,875
Oh, don't get me wrong.

1032
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:35,666
I love drinking hot cocoa by the fire,
ice skating, all that good stuff.

1033
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:39,833
But my grandparents live in Florida,
and they're too old to travel.

1034
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:44,833
And who knows how many more Christmases
I'm gonna spend with them, you know?

1035
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:47,500
That's really sweet of you.

1036
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,125
It's like my mom always says,

1037
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:54,708
"Christmas isn't about where you are
but who you're with."

1038
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:01,416
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. It's just…

1039
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:03,916
I'm such a bad person.

1040
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:09,708
Hey, it's okay.
You couldn't have done anything that bad.

1041
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:13,833
Oh, I ran away and probably broke up
my mom's engagement.

1042
01:15:14,583 --> 01:15:17,250
Okay, that's bad.

1043
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,583
But this guy your mom's with,
he must be pretty horrible.

1044
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:26,541
No, Bob's a really great guy.
And he makes her so happy.

1045
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:31,458
Okay. So now I'm really confused.

1046
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:38,041
It's just, it's only been
a couple years since my… my dad…

1047
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:44,291
And, well, if my mom marries Bob,
then it means…

1048
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,625
Your dad is really gone.

1049
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,166
Yeah. Even though he's not here anymore,

1050
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:54,666
it still feels like he's with us,
you know?

1051
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:58,833
And… I just really wanted
to say goodbye to him.

1052
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,958
And I guess I felt so sad about it,

1053
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:04,583
I wanted everyone else
to feel the same way I did.

1054
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,000
But the truth is, now,

1055
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:11,291
I'd do anything
to spend Christmas with them.

1056
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:14,125
Mom, Teddy, and, yeah, even Bob.

1057
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:20,750
Well, we'll just have to make that happen,
won't we?

1058
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:26,625
- How's it going?
- Almost there.

1059
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,916
Hurry up.

1060
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:36,458
Hey!

1061
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:38,375
Come on.

1062
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:40,750
What do you two think you're doin'?

1063
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:43,625
Hey! Hey! No! Come back here!

1064
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:44,541
Hey, wait!

1065
01:18:03,166 --> 01:18:04,291
Whoo-hoo!

1066
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:17,333
Well, look at that, everybody.
You're all gonna be home for Christmas!

1067
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Yes!

1068
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:27,750
- That was amazing.
- Did you get 'em?

1069
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:29,708
What?

1070
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,583
The batteries.

1071
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:32,750
Oh, yeah.

1072
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,833
Ah, attagirl! Way to go, Kate.

1073
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:37,166
Oh, yeah, Santa.
I want you to meet someone.

1074
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,875
This is… I didn't get your name.

1075
01:18:40,541 --> 01:18:41,375
It's Doug.

1076
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,000
Pierce.

1077
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,041
That's right.

1078
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,458
Wait. Your name is Doug Pierce?

1079
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:53,666
That's me, but how did you know my…

1080
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:58,416
- Is he really Santa?
- Just... Wait. Okay.

1081
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,125
You're Doug Pierce.

1082
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:02,416
Are you from Lowell, Massachusetts?

1083
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,708
Yeah, but I never told you
where I was from.

1084
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:10,166
So, you're my…

1085
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,166
You're my…

1086
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:16,083
Santa, is he my… my…?

1087
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:20,500
I hate to cut this short, kids,
but we need to get going, Kate.

1088
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,625
Time to say goodbye.

1089
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:32,750
Goodbye, Dad.

1090
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:36,375
Excuse me?

1091
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,958
I mean, Doug.

1092
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:49,125
Think you need
to let Doug up for some air, Katie Cat.

1093
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:57,375
Thank you for everything.

1094
01:19:58,416 --> 01:20:01,125
Yeah, well,
a Pierce always sees it through.

1095
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:03,250
Yes, we do.

1096
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:07,916
Spoken like a True Believer.

1097
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:12,541
Kate!

1098
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,625
Merry Christmas, Doug.

1099
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:19,708
Merry Christmas, Kate.

1100
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:23,791
And Merry Christmas, Santa!

1101
01:20:25,416 --> 01:20:27,458
Note to self.

1102
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:31,791
From now on, always bring
a video camera wherever you go.

1103
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:35,791
Now…

1104
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:39,333
There's only one way
to administer this to every elf.

1105
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:40,291
The cannons.

1106
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:43,000
Exactly. Think you can do it?

1107
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:45,041
I got this, Mrs. C.

1108
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:48,791
Oh, Jack, I can't send you out there
alone without protection.

1109
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:50,083
More cookies?

1110
01:20:50,583 --> 01:20:55,125
No cookies are gonna stop
thousands of maniacal elves.

1111
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:56,666
Okay? So, follow me.

1112
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:04,625
You're gonna need
something much stronger.

1113
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:10,208
Whoa!

1114
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:18,041
Look at them, 100% reenergized!

1115
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:20,833
All right, ladies.
This is our last chance to get back.

1116
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:23,750
But, Santa, when we do get back,

1117
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:25,583
how're we gonna get the star
from Belsnickel?

1118
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:28,208
I mean, he's probably already
at the South Pole.

1119
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:33,083
Well, that's a very good point.
Unless, of course, we set this little baby

1120
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:36,875
to 15 seconds
after Belsnickel sent us into the past.

1121
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,041
Ah. Huh?

1122
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:39,500
You'll see.

1123
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:51,750
Bon voyage! Whoo-hoo!

1124
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:55,708
You feel that, everybody?
That's a world without Santa Claus.

1125
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:59,875
You really didn't think
I was just gonna disappear, did you?

1126
01:22:06,583 --> 01:22:09,958
This time, guard it with your life.

1127
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:12,708
On, Comet! On, Blitzen!

1128
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:28,250
Whoa!

1129
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:30,708
Hey! That wasn't very nice!

1130
01:22:36,375 --> 01:22:39,291
Yeah!

1131
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,875
Hyah!

1132
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:56,416
Whoa!

1133
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:13,208
Here we go!

1134
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:37,458
Oh!

1135
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,750
- We're back!
- We made it!

1136
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:44,833
All right, there's the village square.

1137
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:47,958
When we get over the tree, you jump.

1138
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:50,125
Jump? All the way down there?

1139
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:51,458
You'll make it. I promise.

1140
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,500
Here it comes. Get ready!

1141
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:58,041
Get ready! Jump!

1142
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:04,291
Huh?

1143
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,458
Whoa!

1144
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,458
Oh.

1145
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:51,291
Uh-oh.

1146
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:53,250
Uh…

1147
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:54,250
Oh!

1148
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:27,166
Now, coursers, on my command!

1149
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:30,291
Okay, boys! Get ready to charge!

1150
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:43,833
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

1151
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:47,916
Enough!

1152
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,875
Oh, no!

1153
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:01,083
Whoo!

1154
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:09,041
Okay.

1155
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:11,125
Why'd you do that?

1156
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:13,125
To put an end to this nonsense

1157
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:15,583
and stop the two of you
from trying to destroy each other.

1158
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:19,125
I was… I was… I was gonna
veer off, at the very last second.

1159
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:21,083
We were just playing
a little game of chicken.

1160
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:23,083
Exactly! Game of chicken.

1161
01:26:23,166 --> 01:26:25,333
Okay. All right, that's enough.

1162
01:26:25,833 --> 01:26:30,958
Nick, sometimes I think you actually enjoy
these little dangerous escapades.

1163
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:33,500
Oh, don't be silly, I… I…

1164
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:36,333
Well, I… I… Eh.

1165
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:50,166
Oh, Dasher! You're all better now.

1166
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:52,958
Thank you for saving my life. Oh!

1167
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:56,125
Bad move, Yule Cat.

1168
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:14,583
Sayonara, Jola!

1169
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:16,916
Dasher!

1170
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,916
Oh, girl!

1171
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,541
Oh!

1172
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:22,375
Welcome back.

1173
01:27:22,458 --> 01:27:24,875
Welcome back, girl.
You look great!

1174
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:28,291
- She does, doesn't she?
- That was a perfect antler smash!

1175
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:30,583
Oh!

1176
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:32,375
I knew you'd work a miracle.

1177
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:34,125
Thank you.

1178
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:36,958
Welcome back, girl.

1179
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:38,375
Oh!

1180
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:28,333
Whoa!

1181
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:31,541
Oh. Huh?

1182
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:33,583
Uh…

1183
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:39,541
Oh, no!

1184
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:47,833
Just one shot left.

1185
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:52,250
You can do this.

1186
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:17,458
Ah!

1187
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:24,375
Thanks, Jack!

1188
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:25,625
No problem, Kate!

1189
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,750
- We did it!
- Yeah!

1190
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:08,875
- Attagirl, Kate!
- Great job with the cannons, Jack.

1191
01:31:10,458 --> 01:31:13,875
You may have won the battle,
but you'll never win the war.

1192
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:16,875
I'll find another way
to get back in the village.

1193
01:31:16,958 --> 01:31:18,458
I'll come back one day,

1194
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:21,416
and you'll all be in
for the fight of your life.

1195
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,125
I don't really think
you mean that, Belsnickel.

1196
01:31:24,208 --> 01:31:26,625
But if you do, I'll be ready.

1197
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:29,083
But, uh, until then…

1198
01:31:30,041 --> 01:31:32,083
There's something I want you to have.

1199
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:34,583
- A little gift.
- Let me guess.

1200
01:31:35,166 --> 01:31:38,291
Coal? You're so predictable.

1201
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:50,291
The first toy…

1202
01:31:51,958 --> 01:31:53,125
That we built together.

1203
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:55,208
Mm-hmm.

1204
01:31:57,125 --> 01:31:58,000
You kept it?

1205
01:31:58,541 --> 01:32:01,125
Well, I kept working on it.

1206
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:05,708
Helped remind me
of what an amazing elf you are.

1207
01:32:07,958 --> 01:32:09,375
You mean, the elf I was.

1208
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:13,416
He's still in there.
You just need to believe it.

1209
01:32:45,541 --> 01:32:49,166
We had some good times.

1210
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,166
But I'll never be that elf again.

1211
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:55,583
Of course you will.

1212
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:58,416
Easy for you to say.

1213
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:02,375
You don't know what this feels like.

1214
01:33:02,458 --> 01:33:05,000
Belsnickel, you don't need to be an elf

1215
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:09,291
to realize that running away
doesn't solve all your problems.

1216
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:12,708
And sometimes,

1217
01:33:12,791 --> 01:33:15,625
we need to listen
to the ones that we love the most.

1218
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,708
Because at the end of the day,

1219
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:23,000
your family are the only ones
in the whole world

1220
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:24,500
who really understand you.

1221
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:29,916
They're the only ones that will always
be there for you, no matter what.

1222
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,666
Someone really cool once told me

1223
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:37,583
that Christmas isn't about where you are
but who you're with.

1224
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,166
We love you, Belsnickel.

1225
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:45,958
Always have, Bels.

1226
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:53,041
I've always loved you guys.

1227
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:09,958
Oh!

1228
01:34:25,083 --> 01:34:27,541
I officially declare…

1229
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:30,916
Order has been restored to the North Pole!

1230
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:44,041
Now, Dasher,
are you sure you're ready for this trip?

1231
01:34:47,208 --> 01:34:48,166
If you say so.

1232
01:34:50,208 --> 01:34:52,875
All right. Last sleigh to Cancun.

1233
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:55,375
- All aboard.
- Oh, my God.

1234
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:58,750
This is probably gonna be
my first and only trip in the sleigh.

1235
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:01,958
- Can I sit up front, Santa?
- Well, you can't drive from the back.

1236
01:35:02,041 --> 01:35:03,458
- What?
- Yeah.

1237
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:06,750
Now, this puppy's got some serious jump.
You think you can handle it?

1238
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:09,708
- Well, yeah!
- All right. Jump in and get the reins.

1239
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:11,750
There you go.

1240
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:15,000
Hey, Santa?

1241
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:18,208
I just wanted to say thank you.

1242
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:20,208
For what?

1243
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:22,916
For letting me say goodbye to my dad.

1244
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:27,250
Now, Kate, that was purely coincidental.

1245
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:29,666
Yeah, right.

1246
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:32,708
Jump in.

1247
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:34,416
Children! Children!

1248
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:38,958
In case
you get a little peckish on the ride.

1249
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:40,458
What's in these?

1250
01:35:40,541 --> 01:35:44,666
Um, eggs, butter, flour, sugar.

1251
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,625
No. What kinda magic is in them?

1252
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:50,791
I mean, when I ate one in the forest,
I lost all my fears.

1253
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:53,208
The snowman cookie made me feel stronger.

1254
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:59,083
Well, only the gingerbread man
had magic ingredients.

1255
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:01,375
The snowman didn't have any.

1256
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:04,833
But wait.

1257
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:07,666
So, that means…

1258
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:11,166
The hero was always inside you.

1259
01:36:12,291 --> 01:36:16,416
I'll never forget you, Mrs. Claus.

1260
01:36:17,916 --> 01:36:23,458
Oh… you will from time to time,
and that's as it should be.

1261
01:36:27,166 --> 01:36:29,916
Have a great journey.

1262
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:33,958
- Merry Christmas, Mrs. Claus.
- Merry Christmas.

1263
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:36,250
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah?

1264
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:37,416
One last thing.

1265
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:41,083
- What's that?
- Stay away from strangers in golf carts.

1266
01:36:41,166 --> 01:36:43,291
Will do.

1267
01:36:45,208 --> 01:36:46,833
Nick.

1268
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,041
Hurry back.

1269
01:36:54,541 --> 01:36:56,666
Hit it, Jack!

1270
01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:01,166
Here goes. On, Dasher! On, Dancer!
On, Prancer! On, Vixen!

1271
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,875
Goodbye, children!

1272
01:37:09,666 --> 01:37:12,000
All right. Now pull 'em. Come on!

1273
01:37:12,083 --> 01:37:15,541
That's it. That's it.
Now, pull 'em back! Pull 'em!

1274
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:17,333
Harder!

1275
01:37:17,416 --> 01:37:21,458
Not bad. Not bad at all, Jack!

1276
01:37:22,041 --> 01:37:23,750
All right, kids. We're here.

1277
01:37:24,541 --> 01:37:25,458
Ready to jump?

1278
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:26,458
Jump?

1279
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:30,458
All the way down there?

1280
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:33,250
- Mm-hmm.
- Trust me, Jack. You'll be fine.

1281
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:36,250
I don't know, Kate.
I fought a village of crazy elves,

1282
01:37:36,333 --> 01:37:38,750
but this seems kinda dangerous,
if you ask me.

1283
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:41,208
You'll be okay. I promise.

1284
01:37:41,916 --> 01:37:43,958
Hey, Santa.

1285
01:37:44,041 --> 01:37:45,041
Yeah?

1286
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:46,916
Will we ever see you again?

1287
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:49,583
Not if he can help it.

1288
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:53,916
We did it again.

1289
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:56,500
Yes, we did.

1290
01:37:57,833 --> 01:37:58,791
Uh…

1291
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:02,000
Just one thing, Katie Cat.

1292
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:05,666
I know, Santa. I'll be good.

1293
01:38:11,958 --> 01:38:12,958
Whoo-hoo!

1294
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:28,291
On, Dasher!

1295
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:32,333
Merry Christmas, Teddy!

1296
01:38:32,416 --> 01:38:33,833
You've gotta be kidding me.

1297
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,625
Looks like you guys had a visit
from our old friend.

1298
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,458
Was it as good as last time?

1299
01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:54,916
Well, let me put it this way.

1300
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,250
I met Mrs. Claus,

1301
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:59,666
and I helped save Christmas
with Dad when he was 13.

1302
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:01,833
Are… Are you serio... No way.

1303
01:39:01,916 --> 01:39:03,625
Yes way.

1304
01:39:03,708 --> 01:39:06,875
Yeah, well, I climbed a glacier
and fought off a Yule cat,

1305
01:39:06,958 --> 01:39:09,875
so I'm kind of a big deal
at the North Pole now.

1306
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:11,250
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1307
01:39:11,333 --> 01:39:13,916
Me and Mrs. Claus are like this.

1308
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,583
Wow. You guys gotta tell me everything,

1309
01:39:16,666 --> 01:39:20,000
but Bob and Mom are actually
waiting for us, so we gotta go.

1310
01:39:20,083 --> 01:39:20,916
Come on.

1311
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:24,208
When I last saw you,
you were heading to Kids Club.

1312
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,083
How'd you get
from there onto Santa's sleigh?

1313
01:39:26,166 --> 01:39:28,541
You know, that was a life-changing trip.

1314
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:29,833
- It was.
- Mm.

1315
01:39:30,583 --> 01:39:33,666
Mm! Ah, there's my little man.

1316
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:35,083
- Dad!
- Come on! What?

1317
01:39:35,166 --> 01:39:38,000
- I'm so happy to see you, honey!
- That's my main man!

1318
01:39:38,083 --> 01:39:40,041
- Ah, I missed you so much!
- Yeah!

1319
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:41,458
I missed you, too.

1320
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:43,250
Both of you.

1321
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,458
- Really?
- Ah.

1322
01:39:49,541 --> 01:39:50,416
Yeah.

1323
01:39:56,291 --> 01:40:00,041
Kate, I want you to know
I really care for your mother.

1324
01:40:01,125 --> 01:40:03,375
And I hope
that me and you can continue to bond.

1325
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:07,166
I know nothing happens overnight.

1326
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:10,791
One day at a time, right?

1327
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:13,958
One day at a time.

1328
01:40:16,916 --> 01:40:19,750
You know, guys, I was thinking,
maybe tonight…

1329
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,458
Maybe we should have a caroling party.

1330
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:24,583
- Wow!
- Seriously?

1331
01:40:24,666 --> 01:40:25,500
Sure.

1332
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:28,583
I… I think that's a great idea.

1333
01:40:29,875 --> 01:40:32,375
- I love it. I'm in.
- Let's do it.

1334
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:37,375
So, what song should we sing?

1335
01:40:38,666 --> 01:40:41,166
How about "O Christmas Tree"?

1336
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:14,791
Merry Christmas!

1337
01:43:14,875 --> 01:43:17,000
Merry Christmas, Mina!

1338
01:43:47,583 --> 01:43:50,291
Oh, my God.

1338
01:43:51,305 --> 01:44:51,382

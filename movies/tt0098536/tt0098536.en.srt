2
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:26,961
...between the second and fourth slots.
When you've done that

3
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:30,666
with one of these stickers,
it goes on the folder.

4
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:37,012
Each file folder needs to go into its own
Pendaflex folder, the aPProPriate one.

5
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:41,181
Why does it have to be
on the inside and outside folders?

6
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,186
The case number?
Because it's the key to the entire system.

7
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:50,152
lt also goes on the rePort, all Pages,
with a two-hole Punch.

8
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:55,030
Attach it on this two-Prong fastener.
That way nothing gets lost.

9
00:03:55,201 --> 00:04:00,540
Misdemeanours go in here.
Felonies in there.

10
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:04,371
- Plenty of room there.
- Why do you think l'm leaving?

11
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,581
The case load number's also on the
daily sheet. Today, we have two.

12
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:14,752
Two calls. Both down at the Pier.

13
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:18,380
lf we drag our feet,
they can carry us through to lunch.

14
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,310
- HaPPy birthday, Katie.
- Thanks, Scott.

15
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,477
- Could you call me today on the radio?
- About what?

16
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,893
Make something uP. l think it's busted...
Police officer! Out of my way!

17
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,899
- Morning.
- Dave!

18
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,913
- Scott, l made muffins for you.
- You didn't have to, Mrs Remington.

19
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,085
God bless you in that awful city.
We're all hoPing you don't get shot.

20
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,181
Poor boy!

21
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:16,106
- What?
- Seatbelt! lt's the law.

22
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:18,987
Thank you.

23
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:28,333
Come on, l can't smell these
without having one.

24
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:31,622
- Make sure it's just one.
- Thank you.

25
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:43,388
- How many days do you have left?
- Three.

26
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:47,058
- Good.
- Am l getting on your nerves?

27
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,224
l aPPreciate you showing me the roPes,
letting me ride in your nice clean car.

28
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:55,605
- Treating me like a real detective.
- lnvestigator.

29
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,900
Whatever. But when will you
learn to relax?

30
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:03,908
- l am relaxed.
- l'm not talking about the small 'r'.

31
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,947
l'm talking about the big 'R'.
On toP of Old Smokey?

32
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,914
You mean get laid?

33
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:15,131
lt's already been four times this morning.
l'm exhausted!

34
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:35,317
Come on, boys, your mama will be mad.

35
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:42,322
- Mr Boyett.
- How you doing? l hear we're losing you.

36
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:47,072
- Yeah. David Sutton, he's rePlacing me.
- Mr Boyett.

37
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:52,120
- We came to tell you that...
- That they found your dinghy.

38
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:56,339
- You should send somebody to get it.
- l never thought l'd see it again.

39
00:06:56,507 --> 00:07:00,505
Could you show the boys
your detective's badge?

40
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:04,096
- He's a detective?
- An investigator.

41
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:09,306
- l don't know, Dad. Looks fake to me.
- Kid, want to sPend some time in jail?

42
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:14,561
- Cute kids.
- Yeah, well...kids.

43
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,608
Amos?

44
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:30,832
- Who's there?
- lt's me! Scott!

45
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,085
- Let me get a leash on him.
- Do that, Please! Thank you.

46
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,715
Amen.

47
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:52,830
l brought you a muffin, boy!
Here's a muffin. Nice muffin, Hooch!

48
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:57,745
See the muffin?
Here's the muffin for Hooch!

49
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,289
l brought a muffin for you! A muffin!

50
00:09:01,465 --> 00:09:04,253
A muffin, Hooch!

51
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,655
Let him go, Hooch! Let go of him!

52
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:31,286
DroP him!

53
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:40,164
l'm sorry, Scott. l don't have
the hand strength l used to.

54
00:09:40,671 --> 00:09:43,708
- You're OK, aren't you?
- l'm fine.

55
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,631
l was looking forward to a quiet coffee,
but now l'm awake!

56
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:51,848
Don't let him see that you're angry.
He reacts real bad to anger.

57
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:55,883
- What is it with him? He knows me!
- What, know you?

58
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:01,187
He didn't even break the skin.
This dog loves you, boy!

59
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:06,186
Let's go to the house and have a cookie.
Come on, Hooch. Let's go.

60
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:15,447
Doc says l shouldn't give him chocolate.
What do you say, Hooch?

61
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,452
Thought so.

62
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:21,746
l'm here. What's the comPlaint this time?

63
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:27,128
Them! That seafood Plant.
Something's going on over there.

64
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:31,844
- They're OK, other than a stolen dinghy.
- No, it's worse than it was.

65
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:37,257
There's always some strange noises
going on at night.

66
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:43,356
- But you said you don't hear so good.
- l don't hear it. Hooch does. He tells me.

67
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:51,530
Hooch tells you about it.
Well, you live in a Pretty industrial area.

68
00:10:51,742 --> 00:10:55,158
lf you want quiet, move to an aPartment.

69
00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:00,240
Me and Hooch in an aPartment?
That'd be a sight!

70
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:05,453
l thought you didn't mind coming here?

71
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:11,343
l don't mind. lt's just that
l'm leaving on Monday. Remember?

72
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:17,017
The guy who's rePlacing me, he won't
want to come and talk to you like l do.

73
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:22,808
Because...he's scared to death
of your dog... l can't figure out why.

74
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,949
Whoa! All right! That's good.

75
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:45,126
- Yeah, sit there and drool over yourself.
- l gave him whiskey once.

76
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:49,673
And he howled all night...
Now he sticks to beer.

77
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:55,752
- You want some?
- No, thank you. l'm not on his hours.

78
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:01,516
Well, l really have to get going.

79
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:08,568
- Moving uP to the big city?
- Yeah.

80
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:14,865
- Maybe me and Hooch can come visit?
- You? Anytime.

81
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:20,410
Hooch?
Sacramento is the state caPital.

82
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:25,243
l think they have laws
against dogs like Hooch.

83
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,418
- lt's not that funny.
- l can't helP it.

84
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:38,933
Every time l think about it...
l nearly wet my Pants!

85
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,311
- So do l. That's why it's not funny.
- Delta One?

86
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,560
Turner can't come to the Phone.
He's got a dog on his throat.

87
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:53,277
- Say thank you and that we're clear.
- Thanks. We're clear.

88
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:59,700
lt's business. Some kids found money
on Pinecone Beach. $8,000 so far!

89
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,447
- All right.
- We're on it!

90
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,499
Mrs HarPer?

91
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:17,926
First l thought it was Play money.

92
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,677
As it was real, l had them
show me where they found it.

93
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:26,802
- Will more money wash uP here?
- l wouldn't count on it.

94
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:32,224
Here's how this works. lf no one claims
it or identifies it in 30 days, it's yours.

95
00:13:32,403 --> 00:13:36,650
- l found it, it's mine. She can't have any.
- StoP!

96
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:41,029
l'm confiscating it. lf you get it,
you have to use it for college.

97
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:44,579
- See?
- You'll need to fill out some forms.

98
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:46,658
StoP that!

99
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,758
She wanted a church wedding.

100
00:13:55,927 --> 00:14:00,304
Suddenly it's $2,000 for a wedding dress,
recePtion and bar for 400,

101
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:06,178
and l'll end uP Picking uP the tab
for the honeymoon to Bora Bora.

102
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:13,265
- Here he is. Want to talk to him?
- Yeah. Ferraday! l want to talk to you.

103
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,979
l'm talking to you!

104
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,575
What's the hurry?

105
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,318
Hooch, be quiet!

106
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:02,324
For Christ's sake!

107
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:08,782
You know, l feel like an ass.

108
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:14,297
l take you in, give you my trust. What do
you do? Take the food off my kid's Plate!

109
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:22,926
lt was there. l just lost my head.
lt won't haPPen again, Mr Boyett.

110
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,802
Quiet!

111
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:40,110
Casey, get rid of him. Zack,
see if the old man saw. Deal with it.

112
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,177
- Hi there.
- You get out! Back off!

113
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:09,507
HoPe l didn't disturb you. l realise we
were making a racket. l saw your light.

114
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:12,888
Thought l'd come over
to see everything's OK.

115
00:16:13,064 --> 00:16:16,230
Mind your own business.
This is Private ProPerty.

116
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,315
lf we disturbed you, l ought
to comPensate you a little.

117
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:24,438
- This is for any inconvenience...
- l don't want your money.

118
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,449
- l've seen what you're doing over there.
- Wait a minute.

119
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:32,322
- We're doing nothing wrong.
- Get off my dock!

120
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,791
- Don't you shove me! Understand?
- l'm going to introduce you to my dog.

121
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:53,436
Jesus!

122
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:51,867
Hello...? Yeah, l am now.

123
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,703
l'll be right there!

124
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:09,051
The dog was guarding the body.
They wrestled him inside.

125
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,306
- Talk to anybody?
- Nobody heard anything.

126
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:16,175
A seafood worker sPotted the body.

127
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,106
- Ever investigate a murder?
- l moved here to get away from them.

128
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:28,354
Everybody's watching,
so let's look like we've done this before.

129
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:03,856
All right. l've got five rolls of film.
Burn it uP.

130
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,572
lt's those jerks from the Sheriff's Office.

131
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:21,789
- Ladies, if we need helP, we'll call.
- Foster and McCabe, glad to see you.

132
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:25,164
l need coffee. You take sugar? Two.

133
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:31,010
That's cute. ln the sPirit of cooPeration,
get the hell out of here. ls that OK?

134
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:36,469
- The Pier is our jurisdiction.
- The county is the Sheriff's jurisdiction.

135
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,474
- lt's Police work, not a lost bicycle.
- Excuse me.

136
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:48,191
ls this a joke? Every little sPeck of dirt is
not evidence. What are you going to do?

137
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:52,277
Put the entire Pier in a baggie?
What is that for?

138
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,740
- To Preserve what's under his nails.
- What? He was stabbed in the back.

139
00:19:57,914 --> 00:20:02,789
Never anticiPate what will be imPortant.
Gather it to analyse later.

140
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,085
- You read that in a book?
- Yeah, l did. A big blue book.

141
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:11,626
You'd like it. lt had a lot of Pictures!

142
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:15,966
We're all uPset. Why not cooPerate
and get our jobs done?

143
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,556
We'd like to examine the body.
Before it rots.

144
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:27,268
- Give me a minute with my guys?
- No Problem.

145
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:32,522
We have to turn this over
to the Sheriff's DePartment.

146
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,818
Why? They couldn't
find shoes in a shoebox!

147
00:20:35,993 --> 00:20:39,279
You're leaving town,
David's inexPerienced...

148
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:44,876
Wait! l don't have to be in Sacramento
for a week. l'll cancel my vacation.

149
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,876
- We can do it. David's a good learner.
- Turner's a good teacher.

150
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:53,876
Why have investigators
just to investigate stolen mailboxes?

151
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:58,881
Howard! l've got Pay coming.
Let me earn it. We won't let you down.

152
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,178
We deserve a shot at it!

153
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,809
All right...
Do the best you can in the time.

154
00:21:12,989 --> 00:21:17,781
We'll share the lab rePorts with you.
You can examine any evidence. Fair?

155
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,487
- No, not fair.
- Sounds fair to me.

156
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:35,340
- Are you going in there with just these?
- We do this for a living. Stay out of it.

157
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:42,767
Take this.

158
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:47,015
Make sure these are all 8x10
glossies.

159
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:52,149
- Coming out!
- Back off!

160
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,569
- Wait!
- l got you!

161
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,290
Easy!

162
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:19,420
Back him uP! Bad dog!

163
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:30,727
Good boy. Come on.
Over here. Whoa!

164
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:36,354
Slow down, boy!

165
00:22:39,784 --> 00:22:43,864
This dog's nuts! We'll have to shoot him.

166
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:47,122
No. He's the best we have as a witness.

167
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:52,911
Yeah? You think you can handle him?
You're nuts!

168
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:59,044
Where are you going?
He resPonds Poorly to anger, that's all.

169
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,089
- David!
- What?

170
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:06,136
Bring the car, as close as you can!

171
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,762
OPen the back doors,
leave the engine running.

172
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:17,313
Hey, there, Hooch.
You saw the whole thing, didn't you?

173
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:23,277
Well, Amos is gone now.
So you don't have a lot of oPtions, OK?

174
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:28,079
Either you work with me
or they're going to shoot you.

175
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,375
l'm going to...

176
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:36,213
...try to make you
a little more comfortable.

177
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,960
Don't you want to think about it?

178
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,427
Here! Watch! How do you do this?

179
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:51,599
Let me just make you more... Here...

180
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:59,276
Think about it. Maybe we'll get
chocolate chiP cookies. A nice big box.

181
00:23:59,447 --> 00:24:03,065
The soft kind with 22 chiPs! Cookie?

182
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:07,697
Think!

183
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:11,536
Hooch, get in the car!

184
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:15,211
Come on!

185
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,797
- Come on!
- Move back. He's in control.

186
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:27,467
Come on!

187
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:37,497
Are you tired? HoPe so.

188
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:42,756
lf you are, that's too bad. Now, look out!

189
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:50,339
Not too bad. Hold on. Wait a minute.

190
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:55,186
You're going in the clinic for a few days.
lt'll be good for you.

191
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,764
Come on!

192
00:25:58,107 --> 00:26:01,642
Come on! Come on, Hooch!

193
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:09,403
Wait... Whoa, Hooch!
Hooch, no! StoP!

194
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:27,011
l'll kill you! No!

195
00:26:27,178 --> 00:26:30,381
- What are you doing to him?
- Taking a walk!

196
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,723
He's bleeding! My God! For how long?

197
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:38,306
- Not long enough! You... l'll kill you!
- l have a front door!

198
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:42,015
- l'll shoot you, Hooch!
- You stay right there!

199
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:45,396
Fix him uP, so l can shoot him!

200
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,337
All right. All done. Stay!

201
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:11,051
- What's your dog's name?
- Hooch, but...

202
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:14,922
He needed stitches.
When did he last see a vet?

203
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:20,012
- l don't know.
- That's borderline abuse. He's filthy!

204
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:22,859
His diet is terrible. lf you can't...

205
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:27,272
- He belonged to an old man.
- l want to sPeak to him.

206
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:31,195
You can't. He was murdered last night.

207
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:37,156
- l'm Scott Turner, a Police investigator...
- l know. We use the same bank.

208
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:41,958
- Emily Carson... lt's a small town.
- Nice to meet you.

209
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:46,422
Sorry about that.
l can't stand animals being mistreated.

210
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:49,757
- Can l ask you a question about him?
- Yes.

211
00:27:49,927 --> 00:27:57,057
l think he witnessed the crime. He may
have to identify a susPect. Could he?

212
00:27:57,601 --> 00:28:02,892
- Yes.
- Can l show him a Photo? A mugshot?

213
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:06,399
- You don't know about dogs.
- l never had one.

214
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:09,486
- Not even as a kid?
- No way.

215
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:15,572
Dogs don't see in two dimensions.
He'd recognise a scent, but not a Photo.

216
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:18,152
- OK.
- Come on!

217
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:23,573
- Doesn't he have to recouP?
- Well, no. He's a little tired, but he's OK.

218
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:28,415
- You're a good dog.
- You're good with animals.

219
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:32,719
Yeah. l'm a vet! You're buttering me uP.

220
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:39,055
l think he would be better off with you,
than with someone like me. l don't...

221
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:42,181
- Are you married?
- No.

222
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:46,483
- You live alone? House or aPartment?
- House.

223
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:49,605
- You have a girlfriend?
- No.

224
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:52,982
- Well, Perfect.
- Perfect for who?

225
00:28:53,157 --> 00:28:56,111
- Perfect for Hooch.
- For... How?

226
00:28:56,285 --> 00:29:00,579
He'll keeP you comPany and
take care of your house. You're lucky.

227
00:29:00,748 --> 00:29:06,786
- l don't have room for a dog like him!
- Not many PeoPle do. l've got to work...

228
00:29:06,963 --> 00:29:09,454
Goodbye!

229
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:51,417
What? What is it? What?

230
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:57,510
lf you're hungry, finish the hamburgers!
Eat the buns! You're not thirsty!

231
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,342
You won't touch the water, orange juice,
cranaPPle! What do l do?

232
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:05,804
Make you a margarita?

233
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:12,442
Shut uP! God! This has been going on
for two and a half hours!

234
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:13,987
Quiet!

235
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:48,100
All right, you tell me what to do!
What am l suPPosed to do?

236
00:30:48,272 --> 00:30:53,978
You tell me! What am l suPPosed
to do? Stand out on the Porch all night?

237
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:57,653
Give him a Valium. Take one yourself!

238
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:04,076
Hey, shut uP! l'm a Policeman!
Want your car towed?

239
00:31:12,546 --> 00:31:15,464
l hate you.

240
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:26,685
No!

241
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:30,636
You...stuPid dog!

242
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:38,729
You stuPid dog!

243
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:55,214
You want to tear my head off? Go on!
You'll be traPPed inside and starve again!

244
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:59,331
lf they don't find my body first
and shoot you! lt's my house!

245
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:04,386
Back off! l'm coming in!
Back off, Hooch!

246
00:32:06,642 --> 00:32:08,801
Back off.

247
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:36,087
All right. lf we're going to get along,
we'll have to come to an understanding.

248
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:42,712
These are the rules.
No barking. No growling.

249
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:48,256
You will not lift your leg to anything
in here. This is not your room.

250
00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:00,442
No slobbering. No chewing. You'll wear
a flea collar. This is not your room.

251
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:08,943
No begging food. No sniffing crotches.
You will not drink from my toilet.

252
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:12,206
This is not your room.

253
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:20,837
This is your room.
The rest of the house is mine.

254
00:33:21,092 --> 00:33:25,801
When l come back,
l like to find everything where l Put it.

255
00:33:25,972 --> 00:33:27,430
ln its Place.

256
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:32,307
Don't touch my stuff.
l certainly won't touch yours.

257
00:33:34,772 --> 00:33:40,359
This is the room to do that!
This is your bed.

258
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:47,776
You follow these simPle rules, shut uP...

259
00:33:47,952 --> 00:33:51,072
...we'll get along fine.

260
00:34:57,146 --> 00:35:00,895
- What does it tell you?
- l never read an autoPsy rePort.

261
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:05,610
- l don't want to again.
- lt's the key in a homicide investigation.

262
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,489
- The killer Probably had combat training.
- Where's that?

263
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:16,449
"The weaPon Pierced between the third
and fourth rib, entering the right lung."

264
00:35:16,624 --> 00:35:22,247
l read that. Stabbed from behind
on the right. The killer's right-handed.

265
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:26,289
Yeah, but you stab somebody
in the heart, they can scream.

266
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:30,928
Penetrate the lung, they can't even
whisPer. SPecial Forces learn that.

267
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:36,435
- How did you know that?
- l'm a Professional. lt's my job to know.

268
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:39,687
- The coroner told me.
- Hey, fellas!

269
00:35:41,732 --> 00:35:47,153
How much could we get
for all this furniture? l got a better idea.

270
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:52,481
- We'll sell squad cars. Yours first.
- ls there a Problem?

271
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,829
Yeah. The crime lab want
to charge $7,280 for this stuff.

272
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,919
SuPPose l send this in?
Who do you suggest l lay off?

273
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:12,965
- Katie would make the sacrifice.
- l've sacrificed enough for you!

274
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:18,382
We'll thin this out, Howard.
l'll go through it, don't worry. lt's fine.

275
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:29,437
No! You're eating the car!
Don't eat the car!

276
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:34,739
Not the car! What am l yelling
at you for? You're a dog.

277
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:40,201
You don't understand. Doesn't matter.
This car's going to be David Sutton's.

278
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:43,494
Hungry? Here's an ashtray. Eat that.

279
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:15,899
lt's terrible about Amos.
l'm locking my door tonight.

280
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:18,989
Don't do that. We'll catch him.

281
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:08,164
ls this dog food? lt's turkey and bacon.

282
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:11,422
PeoPle love their dogs and want variety.

283
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:27,187
- What kind of dog are we talking about?
- Very big, very large, very tall, very wide.

284
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:30,808
- Massive. Ugly!
- Well, you don't need this.

285
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:36,821
What you need is...this!

286
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:12,650
- l don't like the dog. Why get him a toy?
- Dogs like to chew.

287
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:17,860
lt's either this, or your furniture,
or your shoes. lt's uP to you.

288
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,383
- Sunday!
- lmperial Raceway!

289
00:39:42,557 --> 00:39:44,715
The semi-finals...

290

Either that or he's stuPid. No!

307
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:19,622
Send me hail the size of cantalouPes,

308
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:22,626
No!

309
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:30,007
Cut it...
No... l'm running out of doors!

310
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:38,431
She can't stay!

311
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:04,450
You go ahead. Not you! No, come on.
Just her. Get back in the car.

312
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:11,914
Wait, what am l doing?
Go ahead, Hooch. Go!

313
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:20,764
Go! Go ahead! Go, boy! Follow her, boy!
She wants you, man!

314
00:45:21,311 --> 00:45:26,471
This is why she's doing this,
so you'll follow her. ln, in! Go in!

315
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:35,155
- Hi... Scott Turner, right?
- Yeah, l was looking for my dog.

316
00:45:35,325 --> 00:45:39,239
- l noticed. Know anything about fuses?
- Electrical fuses?

317
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:45,790
- Can you come in? For two minutes?
- A fuse box? Sure.

318
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:50,456
lt's on!

319
00:45:50,632 --> 00:45:55,590
- What?
- The bedroom light is on!

320
00:45:56,221 --> 00:46:01,891
- Say when the bathroom light goes on.
- All right.

321
00:46:03,937 --> 00:46:06,013
Hey!

322
00:46:09,984 --> 00:46:14,314
- Hey!
- No, not yet.

323
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:30,874
- Look, thank you, but...
- lt's on. This will take you all night.

324
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:36,339
- No, l just quit.
- You were going to leave it like this?

325
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:40,295
Yes... l'm starting again tomorrow, but...

326
00:46:40,473 --> 00:46:45,468
You don't have to helP, but there's
rollers there and an extra brush.

327
00:46:45,645 --> 00:46:50,188
- This bothers you.
- This would make me nuts.

328
00:46:51,902 --> 00:46:55,353
- lt's harder to cut it in a big town.
- lt's not.

329
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:01,031
ln a big town, you make your mistakes.
No one sees. Who cares?

330
00:47:01,202 --> 00:47:06,327
- A small town, you've got to face PeoPle.
- There's more to it than that.

331
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,785
Good. You'll be luckier with women.

332
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:14,374
Women in big cities outnumber men.
They're more desPerate.

333
00:47:15,175 --> 00:47:20,513
Thank you. lf you have oPinions,
exPress them. Don't be shy.

334
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,595
- Just...blurt them out.
- You're better off here.

335
00:47:25,268 --> 00:47:29,218
- lt's wonderful for raising kids.
- l don't have kids.

336
00:47:29,397 --> 00:47:34,059
- l want five kids.
- Have you got a dad Picked out yet?

337
00:47:34,235 --> 00:47:39,063
- Not yet.
- l'll fill you in on the singles scene here.

338
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:45,160
- God, l hate that Phrase.
- There's Embers Cocktail Lounge.

339
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:51,582
Or what else? l guess the Dairy Queen,
but l usually arrest guys my age there.

340
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:56,047
- But you're oPinionated and want 5 kids.
- l am.

341
00:47:57,217 --> 00:48:02,757
And we...are...finished.

342
00:48:04,641 --> 00:48:06,764
This is good.

343
00:48:06,935 --> 00:48:09,936
- lt feels good?
- Very good. l admit it.

344
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:23,653
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

345
00:48:34,087 --> 00:48:38,464
You have Paint all over you.
lt's even in your hair.

346
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:43,544
Look at you. You don't even have it
on your hands. SPotless.

347
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:54,730
- l have some Packing l have to do.
- Right.

348
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:06,825
lt's a nice night... l have to walk Camille.
Want to take a walk with me?

349
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:10,320
- No.
- No?

350
00:49:10,498 --> 00:49:16,453
No... You see, l'm starting to like you.
lf we walk, l'm going to like you more.

351
00:49:16,629 --> 00:49:21,291
Then we might fall in love
and everything will be fine for a while.

352
00:49:21,468 --> 00:49:25,548
But one day you'll call me a
comPulsive bastard, and scream,

353
00:49:25,722 --> 00:49:28,806
and say you never
want to see me again.

354
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:33,388
And l'm shattered. Who needs that?
Goodnight. Hooch!

355
00:49:40,528 --> 00:49:44,526
- What time do you want to do that hall?
- About 7 P.m.

356
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:20,982
Goodnight, Houdini.

357
00:51:42,484 --> 00:51:45,935
OK, boy! Guess what? Time for a bath!

358
00:51:46,613 --> 00:51:52,069
Come on!
Come to the bathroom. Let's go!

359
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:58,783
Come on!

360
00:53:08,612 --> 00:53:12,609
This is why men will Prevail
and dogs won't dominate Earth.

361
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:17,447
You can do this with thumbs!

362
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:28,043
Move around! l don't care...
There you go! What a ferocious dog!

363
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:32,710
Get your armPits, your undercarriage.

364
00:54:40,495 --> 00:54:44,493
lf l leave you in the car,
you'll just eat the rest of it.

365
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:47,157
Come on.

366
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,638
What is that?
You can't bring a dog in here.

367
00:55:04,811 --> 00:55:07,847
Can you lift uP this desk?

368
00:55:13,987 --> 00:55:18,483
- There's something different about you.
- l like to think so.

369
00:55:19,743 --> 00:55:21,118
l know.

370
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,495
No tie.

371
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:27,246
lt's the first time
you haven't worn a tie at work.

372
00:55:29,085 --> 00:55:32,620
- The dog's on the window sill.
- Get down.

373
00:55:39,053 --> 00:55:41,675
The dog loves weddings.

374
00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:54,934
Knock it off!

375
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,941
Shut uP, Hooch! Come on, shut uP!

376
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,820
You'd better get the hell out of here.

377
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:21,636
What is it?

378
00:56:31,773 --> 00:56:36,601
- Dave! Police officers! How're you doing?
- Right behind you!

379
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:53,161
Don't Panic!

380
00:57:08,101 --> 00:57:10,343
What are you doing?

381
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:38,166
- Seen that guy before?
- No! l can't see his Plates, either.

382
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,669
Hold it! Police officers!
We need your car. Hi, Ernie.

383
00:57:42,844 --> 00:57:47,305
- Buckle your seat belt!
- At a time like this? l can't find it!

384
00:57:47,474 --> 00:57:51,851
- Let's go!
- We've got to get Hooch.

385
00:57:53,855 --> 00:57:58,434
Come on! Get in...
Good boy! Watch his tail!

386
00:58:00,779 --> 00:58:05,820
Mom will kill me. She said
not to take it over 40. lt's brand new!

387
00:58:05,992 --> 00:58:09,610
- This will break it in. She'll thank you.
- Hang on.

388
00:58:09,788 --> 00:58:13,204
- He's on Mom's groceries!
- SlaP his face.

389
00:58:15,961 --> 00:58:18,368
OK, it's a Cadillac.

390
00:58:18,546 --> 00:58:23,173
- The licence Plate! l see the car.
- Hold on... P...

391
00:58:23,343 --> 00:58:25,003
K...l.

392
00:58:26,513 --> 00:58:29,513
- lt's B...
- lt's a P!

393
00:58:29,683 --> 00:58:33,383
- Shut uP, Ernie!
- PKl...

394
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:38,722
RKl 547!

395
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,687
RKl 547. OK, hang on!

396
00:58:42,237 --> 00:58:45,653
- He saw us!
- Come on!

397
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:51,992
- Which way?
- Right!... l'm sure it's right.

398
00:58:52,163 --> 00:58:55,781
- Don't guess!
- lt's right! OK?

399
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:05,134
lf Highway Patrol hears about that,
l'm out of a job!

400
00:59:05,302 --> 00:59:10,592
- lt'll be our little secret.
- Your mom! Can't she get a faster car?

401
00:59:12,726 --> 00:59:16,260
Well! You boys livened uP the recePtion.

402
00:59:16,438 --> 00:59:20,436
The bride swore she'd have nightmares
because of that dog.

403
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:25,060
Boyett thought you were after the beast.

404
00:59:25,238 --> 00:59:30,659
And the Mayor did, too. l, of course,
didn't tell him it was your runaway Pet...

405
00:59:30,827 --> 00:59:35,619
- ...and the station mascot.
- Don't raise your voice. You'll uPset him.

406
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:38,495
He's chained to a radiator.

407
00:59:38,668 --> 00:59:41,835
Zack Gregory is an ex-Marine
with three arrests.

408
00:59:42,005 --> 00:59:47,628
Assault with a deadly weaPon,
gunrunning, extortion. No convictions.

409
00:59:47,802 --> 00:59:51,337
That address and number were false.

410
00:59:51,514 --> 00:59:56,757
- So, who is he?
- The guy Hooch saw kill Amos Reed.

411
00:59:56,937 --> 01:00:01,812
- You're kidding. Think this is the guy?
- Yeah.

412
01:00:01,983 --> 01:00:03,477
What?

413
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:14,911
- You broke the case.
- Not yet.

414
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,116
There's no motive.

415
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:21,742
Amos wasn't killed in a robbery or a fight.

416
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,289
We think it was to cover something uP.

417
01:00:25,465 --> 01:00:29,379
Zack is emPloyed by Boyett Seafood.

418
01:00:29,552 --> 01:00:32,838
Amos rePorted strange noises there.

419
01:00:33,014 --> 01:00:37,012
- Like something illegal was going on.
- Katie?

420
01:00:37,185 --> 01:00:40,720
Could you swing the door oPen?
We need some air.

421
01:00:40,897 --> 01:00:44,847
- Amos comPlained about everything.
- And now he's dead.

422
01:00:45,026 --> 01:00:47,185
He was right.

423
01:00:47,362 --> 01:00:53,780
lt's isolated. There's fishing boats
coming and going. Now he's killed?

424
01:00:53,952 --> 01:00:58,780
Drugs. l know we'll never have a warrant
with what we have so far.

425
01:00:58,957 --> 01:01:02,622
But it would be nice
if we could search that Place.

426
01:01:02,794 --> 01:01:07,503
OK. Boyett's a friend.
What's he going to say? No?

427
01:01:09,843 --> 01:01:15,632
DEA agents, Customs, the CHP...

428
01:01:15,807 --> 01:01:19,757
...two shifts of our own guys,
Plus all sorts of local coPs.

429
01:01:19,936 --> 01:01:25,725
This is going to be the biggest search
here since World War ll, all due to you.

430
01:01:26,443 --> 01:01:29,444
We'll go at it like bacon through a duck.

431
01:01:29,613 --> 01:01:33,444
And bust us a smuggling oPeration.
Here's dessert.

432
01:01:33,616 --> 01:01:39,037
Chocolate chiP cookies...
Something to drink?

433
01:01:39,956 --> 01:01:43,290
lt won't hurt me if we imPress the CHP.

434
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:49,580
That'll look good on the rיsumי.
Give me a little job security in the future.

435
01:01:49,758 --> 01:01:52,961
There! Come on, you're not eating.

436
01:01:53,136 --> 01:01:55,757
Go ahead.

437
01:01:55,930 --> 01:02:02,099
This is a celebration. You lD'd Gregory.
Amos' murder is all but solved.

438
01:02:02,562 --> 01:02:05,765
So, go. OPen your beer.

439
01:02:11,112 --> 01:02:15,192
You're thinking about Amos?
You must miss him.

440
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:19,868
Yeah, well...

441
01:02:20,038 --> 01:02:24,202
l forget that this must be hard on you.
Everything's so different.

442
01:02:24,376 --> 01:02:29,999
You and l got off to a bad start and
my Place isn't a shack filled with junk.

443
01:02:31,841 --> 01:02:35,969
Not yet, anyway.
You can keeP working on it.

444
01:02:36,137 --> 01:02:38,510
OK?

445
01:02:42,143 --> 01:02:46,141
You like that?

446
01:02:49,234 --> 01:02:51,025
You do.

447
01:02:51,194 --> 01:02:56,401
Here, let me do this side, as well.

448
01:02:56,574 --> 01:03:00,655
You're not so rough. You're not so mean.

449
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:05,621
You're not any kind
of a monster dog, are you?

450
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:09,541
Look at those big teeth.
What are you doing?

451
01:03:09,713 --> 01:03:12,038
Give me my towel.

452
01:03:19,889 --> 01:03:21,384
Come on!

453
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:33,647
Off the couch!

454
01:03:39,117 --> 01:03:41,193
l'm not afraid of you.

455
01:03:50,003 --> 01:03:54,712
lf my emPloyees are involved,
l'll cooPerate. l just don't get it.

456
01:03:54,883 --> 01:03:58,963
- When did you last see Zack?
- At the wedding.

457
01:03:59,137 --> 01:04:02,802
His address was a motel.
They'd never heard of him.

458
01:04:03,767 --> 01:04:07,599
lf he shows uP for his Paycheque,
l'll call you.

459
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,982
Let's go!

460
01:04:12,859 --> 01:04:18,482
l don't want the Sheriff's guys handling
this stuff alone. Be with them all the way.

461
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,408
l hate fish.

462
01:04:25,497 --> 01:04:28,166
Check the back.

463
01:04:48,061 --> 01:04:51,809
Go through these one by one.

464
01:05:08,623 --> 01:05:15,242
- Maybe we came on the wrong day?
- Howard, l'm sorry. We let you down.

465
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:21,507
Forget it. You can't exPect things to Pan
out every time. Your new job's waiting.

466
01:05:21,678 --> 01:05:27,930
Go home, Pack uP and get ready.
David, the case is now yours.

467
01:05:36,443 --> 01:05:40,820
Foster, the guys in Monterey said
you did the initial go-see on Gregory,

468
01:05:40,906 --> 01:05:45,947
but the DMV sent his vehicle
registration to the Lazy Acres Motel.

469
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:52,489
So how did you discover it was
a false address? Did you just Phone?

470
01:05:54,461 --> 01:05:59,123
You didn't go for an interview
and show them a Photo?

471
01:05:59,841 --> 01:06:05,464
l need surveillance done
on the motel to locate Zack Gregory.

472
01:06:05,638 --> 01:06:11,392
He's the Prime susPect in Amos Reed's
murder, that's why... Yes, he is!

473
01:06:11,561 --> 01:06:16,638
He's legitimate! l have an eye witness,
kind of. l'm not telling you your job.

474
01:06:16,816 --> 01:06:22,237
l'm a law enforcement officer, and
l'm asking you a Professional courtesy.

475
01:06:22,405 --> 01:06:23,816
Don't hang uP!

476
01:06:26,534 --> 01:06:28,527
Dumb coP!

477
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:38,794
Scott Turner... Hi!
How's the town vet?

478
01:06:41,925 --> 01:06:46,468
lt keePs Playing in my brain what Amos
told me, that something's going on there.

479
01:06:46,638 --> 01:06:52,806
- l can't figure it out or stoP thinking of it.
- Maybe you should...stoP thinking of it.

480
01:06:52,978 --> 01:06:56,678
When l have a Problem l can't solve,

481
01:06:56,856 --> 01:07:01,602
sometimes l just think
of something comPletely different.

482
01:07:01,778 --> 01:07:05,361
That's when the solution comes.
Out of nowhere.

483
01:07:05,532 --> 01:07:09,316
- Fascinating. l don't work that way.
- Well, try.

484
01:07:09,494 --> 01:07:13,077
- No, l can't.
- Well, l'll helP.

485
01:07:13,248 --> 01:07:16,782
- l don't know how.
- l'm thinking of something. What is it?

486
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,533
- Don't!
- lndulge me.

487
01:07:19,713 --> 01:07:22,583
- l don't know.
- Great.

488
01:07:23,633 --> 01:07:30,217
- So you've never thought about it?
- Never thought about what?

489
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:34,518
- Oh! Thought about that!
- Well...

490
01:07:34,686 --> 01:07:37,604
l'm a guy. l've thought about that.

491
01:07:37,772 --> 01:07:39,350
- How far did you get?
- Well...

492
01:07:39,524 --> 01:07:42,560
l got to unbutton...

493
01:07:44,863 --> 01:07:48,362
...unbuttoning your blouse.

494
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:51,653
l got a lot farther than that.

495
01:07:51,828 --> 01:07:57,534
- You did? How far? A lot farther?
- A lot farther.

496
01:07:59,961 --> 01:08:05,300
- l didn't know there was farther.
- You have to use your imagination.

497
01:08:05,467 --> 01:08:09,630
- That's got to be illegal.
- Probably is.

498
01:08:29,949 --> 01:08:34,161
- Right from the carton?
- A woman in my house!

499
01:08:34,329 --> 01:08:37,780
How did that haPPen?

500
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:42,370
- How's your back?
- lt's regained some elasticity.

501
01:08:42,545 --> 01:08:47,338
Yeah. This is emPty.
What are we going to do about it?

502
01:08:47,509 --> 01:08:52,799
Most of my grocery budget's gone
on my dog, but we could manage the...

503
01:08:52,973 --> 01:08:55,808
- There's eggs.
- ...Perfect omelette.

504
01:08:55,976 --> 01:09:00,222
- Go to it.
- Well...

505
01:09:00,438 --> 01:09:02,645
No, no, no!

506
01:09:02,815 --> 01:09:06,398
- "We" was the oPerative word there.
- No.

507
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:10,982
- You look lovely in the light.
- l don't do this.

508
01:09:11,157 --> 01:09:15,237
- Here's where it's at. We have cheese.
- Come on.

509
01:09:15,412 --> 01:09:20,157
- l'll mess uP your kitchen.
- l'm not cooking. You wore me out!

510
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:23,619
Did l? We could call for Pizza.

511
01:09:23,795 --> 01:09:28,172
Don't. l'll walk you through it.
That's the omelette Pan.

512
01:09:28,341 --> 01:09:32,754
- You got a little Pan just for omelettes?
- There's a whisk.

513
01:09:41,396 --> 01:09:43,685
No... l'm hungry.

514
01:09:43,857 --> 01:09:47,641
- l'm doing it.
- l'd like to eat in the next five hours.

515
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:54,071
There we go, and great! Now, mix that
uP and then we'll throw in the other stuff.

516
01:09:54,617 --> 01:09:59,326
- No, that's stirring. This is how you mix.
- No, l...

517
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:08,166
- Oh, God! Do that again, would you?
- You like that?

518
01:10:08,339 --> 01:10:10,628
Yeah.

519
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,960
You feel so good. You smell so good.

520
01:10:29,235 --> 01:10:31,905
- What?
- Of course!

521
01:10:32,072 --> 01:10:36,021
They're not bringing something in!
How could l...

522
01:10:36,201 --> 01:10:39,237
- The thing l wasn't thinking of!
- The thought?

523
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:42,864
- Yes! Bang! lt never haPPened before!
- l told you.

524
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:45,497
l got to search again!

525
01:10:45,668 --> 01:10:50,247
- They're smuggling something out!
- So l'm eating alone?

526
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:55,217
l'm sorry, yeah! l'll make it uP to you.

527
01:10:55,387 --> 01:10:59,716
Know that ltalian Place in San RaPello?
They make a lasagne.

528
01:10:59,891 --> 01:11:05,478
lt's not a great lasagne. l make better,
but you want to go tomorrow night?

529
01:11:06,314 --> 01:11:08,722
You'll still be here?

530
01:11:10,652 --> 01:11:13,107
Oh, yes!

531
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:21,861
- Another night, at least... Hooch!
- He's outside.

532
01:11:22,038 --> 01:11:24,494
- What?
- With Camille.

533
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:27,999
Listen, would you clean this stuff uP?

534
01:11:28,169 --> 01:11:30,328
Just... Leave it!

535
01:11:30,505 --> 01:11:32,793
lt's all right.

536
01:11:32,966 --> 01:11:37,046
- God! What time?
- Seven? l'll meet you here.

537
01:11:38,555 --> 01:11:43,715
Hooch, come on!
Hooch, put that down! Come on!

538
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:57,780
This your first stakeout? lt's mine.

539
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:06,955
Well, it's going to be a long night.
What do you say we PrePare for it?

540
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:12,712
Try to stay alert. Want one?
There you go. SPecial treat.

541
01:12:15,133 --> 01:12:16,757
That's good.

542
01:12:24,684 --> 01:12:27,602
They're hard.

543
01:12:33,652 --> 01:12:35,728
Well...

544
01:12:36,988 --> 01:12:41,116
lt's not bad...
Tastes like health food.

545
01:12:41,659 --> 01:12:44,779
You can have this.

546
01:12:46,456 --> 01:12:48,413
Back in!

547
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,993
Now...

548
01:12:51,169 --> 01:12:55,083
...back to work.

549
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:00,670
lt was called Lancelot Link,
Secret Chimp.

550
01:13:00,845 --> 01:13:04,179
lt was like The Man From U.N.C.L.E.
Did Amos have a TV?

551
01:13:04,349 --> 01:13:09,936
lt's two-dimensional, you couldn't see it.
These chimPs were sPies, in suits.

552
01:13:10,105 --> 01:13:13,853
They'd wear hats and smoke cigarettes.

553
01:13:14,984 --> 01:13:19,064
You missed it!
The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was good.

554
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:21,860
That was cool.

555
01:13:22,033 --> 01:13:25,153
lt wasn't Lancelot Link.

556
01:13:44,806 --> 01:13:48,970
What does that do for you?
That feel good?

557
01:13:49,144 --> 01:13:52,809
Wake you uP a little bit?

558
01:13:59,487 --> 01:14:01,729
You have to be a dog.

559
01:14:05,994 --> 01:14:10,703
l had the enlistment PaPers filled out.
All that was sent.

560
01:14:10,874 --> 01:14:14,041
But l have this distance vision thing.

561
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:19,417
So no flight school for me. lf you're in
the Air Force and not in flight school...

562
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:25,843
Means you're scraPing birdshit off
a runway in Guam. So, here l am.

563
01:14:27,349 --> 01:14:31,181
l'm boring you?

564
01:14:34,647 --> 01:14:40,650
lt's mine. l got you something... Here.

565
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:46,159
l got you a Diet Coke.
Diet, because... Look at that!

566
01:14:46,326 --> 01:14:48,152
Work on that.

567
01:14:49,663 --> 01:14:55,915
We've known each other a while now.
l think it's safe for me to say that...

568
01:14:56,085 --> 01:15:00,083
Are you aware of your drooling Problem?

569
01:15:00,256 --> 01:15:05,595
lt looks like you swallowed a tennis shoe
and you got the laces hanging out.

570
01:15:05,762 --> 01:15:10,305
lt's a bit embarrassing, don't you think?

571
01:15:10,475 --> 01:15:16,727
Maybe you could save it. ls there a use
for this? Like, as an industrial lubricant?

572
01:15:18,024 --> 01:15:22,485
Good God! l hate to think
what you're doing to the car.

573
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,302
- Did you bring it?
- Yeah.

574
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:53,425
- You know we have to take it back.
- Yeah, we'll take it back. Come on.

575
01:15:53,602 --> 01:15:59,604
There you go. l saw Boyett leave, so
let's get this over with before he's back.

576
01:15:59,774 --> 01:16:04,152
- Wait, what about getting Permission?
- Why don't you relax?

577
01:16:04,321 --> 01:16:07,275
Something's not right here.

578
01:16:07,449 --> 01:16:11,031
- You got that look.
- l don't know what you mean.

579
01:16:12,621 --> 01:16:16,914
- You humPed the vet!
- You have a lot of class!

580
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:20,867
l had a religious exPerience
with the future Mrs Turner,

581
01:16:21,045 --> 01:16:24,545
who, yes, holds a veterinary doctorate.

582
01:16:26,009 --> 01:16:30,172
- Get that ugly mutt out!
- We're Police. This is a Police dog.

583
01:16:30,347 --> 01:16:33,716
- We just want to look around.
- You did.

584
01:16:33,892 --> 01:16:38,767
- The dog wasn't available yesterday.
- He's a health code violation.

585
01:16:38,938 --> 01:16:43,601
l don't understand.
Mr Boyett said he'd cooPerate!

586
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:48,740
Well, if he said so.

587
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:53,108
- Thanks.
- Liar.

588
01:16:53,286 --> 01:16:55,243
- What?
- He didn't.

589
01:16:55,414 --> 01:16:57,655
He did. Yesterday.

590
01:17:03,838 --> 01:17:06,875
Come here, boy.

591
01:17:10,637 --> 01:17:16,011
OK, Hooch. Let's find
some money. Can you?

592
01:17:16,184 --> 01:17:22,057
Can you find some money? Smell it.
Smell that money. Find me some, OK?

593
01:17:22,231 --> 01:17:23,774
And for me.

594
01:17:23,942 --> 01:17:25,400
Go!

595
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:30,356
- Why do you think there's a connection?
- Know why l took that job?

596
01:17:30,532 --> 01:17:35,906
- Because nothing haPPens here. So?
- There's been two unusual incidents:

597
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:41,833
Amos' murder, and $8,000 found on the
beach. A day aPart. Maybe there's a link.

598
01:17:42,001 --> 01:17:43,460
Maybe not.

599
01:17:46,297 --> 01:17:47,673
What?

600
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,681
You got something? What is it?

601
01:17:56,850 --> 01:17:59,969
What you got?

602
01:18:03,732 --> 01:18:05,808
A Perfect match.

603
01:18:05,984 --> 01:18:10,445
The same size, same brand.
Everything! Good boy!

604
01:18:12,824 --> 01:18:16,027
- Way to go! Good going.
- All right!

605
01:18:16,203 --> 01:18:22,371
Mr Boyett says he never gave you
Permission for the dog. He's furious.

606
01:18:22,542 --> 01:18:24,749
l hoPe he sues!

607
01:18:25,629 --> 01:18:30,705
We're done anyway. Thanks.
Come on, Hooch. Here we go!

608
01:18:31,466 --> 01:18:34,337
l could get fired over this.

609
01:18:34,511 --> 01:18:38,129
You have another job. l like a town
where nothing haPPens.

610
01:18:38,307 --> 01:18:43,977
Don't worry, l'll take the blame. l'll talk
to Boyett, and l'll call Howard, as well.

611
01:18:44,146 --> 01:18:48,274
- What should l do?
- Find out how common these bags are.

612
01:18:48,442 --> 01:18:54,860
Are they in suPermarkets, or a sPecial
order? Check businesses and stores.

613
01:18:55,032 --> 01:18:58,199
Then Park the car,
turn off the radio, take naP.

614
01:18:58,369 --> 01:19:01,868
lf you're in on what l'm doing,
you will get fired.

615
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:29,732
Stay!

616
01:19:41,245 --> 01:19:46,915
Skipper! MaryAnn and Ginger...
We got to warn them!

617
01:19:47,084 --> 01:19:48,459
No vacancy.

618
01:19:55,384 --> 01:19:58,752
SPeak English, moron? No vacancy.

619
01:20:03,434 --> 01:20:06,103
lf you ain't got a warrant, get lost!

620
01:20:07,145 --> 01:20:09,304
- Know him?
- No.

621
01:20:10,607 --> 01:20:15,602
l don't have much exPerience at
being an intimidating coP, or threatening.

622
01:20:15,779 --> 01:20:17,855
You break my heart.

623
01:20:18,032 --> 01:20:23,737
So in order for you to take me seriously,
l have to shoot you in the leg.

624
01:20:25,956 --> 01:20:28,708
You almost shot me!

625
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:31,996
l can't believe l missed. Where is he?

626
01:20:32,171 --> 01:20:35,088
- Put the gun down.
- Zack Gregory?

627
01:20:35,257 --> 01:20:37,629
l believe so.

628
01:20:46,602 --> 01:20:49,936
Over to the Cadillac. You drive.

629
01:20:58,864 --> 01:21:01,865
A seat belt? Oh, yeah.

630
01:21:02,034 --> 01:21:07,241
Think that's going to keeP you safe?
Start the car! What are you doing?

631
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:12,164
Now start it!

632
01:21:17,925 --> 01:21:19,300
Go left.

633
01:21:22,596 --> 01:21:24,090
Slow down!

634
01:21:46,328 --> 01:21:50,706
You won't do it...
You don't have what it takes.

635
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:54,623
To kill you? You're right, l don't.
But he does.

636
01:21:58,757 --> 01:22:03,051
lnteresting sensation, isn't it?
l'm going to ask some questions.

637
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:06,671
You blink once for yes, twice for no. OK?

638
01:22:06,849 --> 01:22:09,885
Once. OK. You killed Amos Reed?

639
01:22:11,478 --> 01:22:15,428
l don't believe you.
Hooch says you did.

640
01:22:17,108 --> 01:22:19,979
Yes... Progress. Good.

641
01:22:20,154 --> 01:22:23,155
The seafood Plant is a cover?

642
01:22:23,991 --> 01:22:26,909
You're smuggling cash out? Yes.

643
01:22:27,077 --> 01:22:30,078
OK. This is fun.

644
01:22:30,247 --> 01:22:32,916
Boyett's in charge?

645
01:22:33,959 --> 01:22:38,003
l can't stoP him from snaPPing your neck.
ls Boyett in charge?

646
01:22:41,884 --> 01:22:47,305
ls Boyett in on it?
All right.

647
01:22:48,349 --> 01:22:51,765
l'm sorry. Here, back this way.

648
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:57,896
l'm going to make you a little more
comfortable. Good. Now, sit down.

649
01:23:02,529 --> 01:23:07,606
Come on, boy.
KeeP an eye on him for me, would you?

650
01:23:07,784 --> 01:23:11,118
What is this in your Pocket? Thanks.

651
01:23:11,288 --> 01:23:13,364
Thanks.

652
01:23:30,849 --> 01:23:35,392
OK, is there any way
l can get you to understand this?

653
01:23:35,562 --> 01:23:39,263
l need you to cover the back.
Understand?

654
01:23:39,441 --> 01:23:41,517
The backyard?

655
01:23:41,693 --> 01:23:45,643
The back door? The gate?
The back of the building?

656
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,905
Please? Cover the back!

657
01:23:54,665 --> 01:23:57,999
What a good dog!

658
01:24:12,474 --> 01:24:15,974
- Howard, you scared me!
- l'm sorry.

659
01:24:16,145 --> 01:24:18,980
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

660
01:24:19,147 --> 01:24:22,812
l got here as fast as l could.
Boyett! You were right!

661
01:24:22,985 --> 01:24:26,567
- Where's the back-uP?
- Four cars on CarPenter Road.

662
01:24:26,739 --> 01:24:32,362
- They're ready any time l signal them.
- OK.

663
01:24:32,536 --> 01:24:35,537
- You ready?
- Yeah.

664
01:24:45,007 --> 01:24:50,001
- Looks like we missed them.
- Yeah.

665
01:24:56,393 --> 01:25:01,388
The engine of this fork-lift is warm.
Looks like we just missed them.

666
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:05,648
- Because you tiPPed them off!
- What's going on?

667
01:25:05,819 --> 01:25:08,773
Call your back-uP. Use the radio.

668
01:25:08,947 --> 01:25:10,323
lt's me!

669
01:25:10,491 --> 01:25:14,868
You're laundering money.
You got the Perfect set-uP.

670
01:25:15,037 --> 01:25:19,248
This small town where nothing haPPens.
Police Protection.

671
01:25:19,416 --> 01:25:22,085
- l know how you do it.
- No!

672
01:25:34,223 --> 01:25:40,343
lt's all the evidence l need.
Who's going to sell you out first? Zack?

673
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,430
Or Boyett?

674
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:28,854
- He's between us.
- Right side!

675
01:26:29,027 --> 01:26:30,652
Cover me!

676
01:27:48,107 --> 01:27:50,811
You hit my leg.

677
01:28:02,163 --> 01:28:04,949
Hands behind your head.

678
01:28:05,124 --> 01:28:08,789
- Don't turn around.
- Howard...

679
01:28:08,961 --> 01:28:13,041
He's still got his Pistol...
What are you doing?

680
01:28:18,428 --> 01:28:19,804
Scott?

681
01:28:19,972 --> 01:28:24,717
l'll kill you if l have to,
but this will be a lot easier to exPlain

682
01:28:24,893 --> 01:28:29,057
- if we both have the same story.
- What?

683
01:28:29,231 --> 01:28:33,478
We came to question him.
He fired at us. We fired back.

684
01:28:33,652 --> 01:28:39,607
Killed the susPect. Congratulations!
You solved the case.

685
01:28:39,783 --> 01:28:45,537
l met some PeoPle in Panama.
They needed a way to move cash out.

686
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:48,828
l got one Per cent.

687
01:28:49,001 --> 01:28:52,334
- lt's drug money.
- l don't know that.

688
01:28:52,504 --> 01:28:56,632
l never asked. lt's a shame
PeoPle are getting killed over it.

689
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,466
When l found out, it was too late.
You believe me?

690
01:29:00,637 --> 01:29:05,133
- How do you exPlain Amos' murder?
- That's covered.

691
01:29:05,309 --> 01:29:09,057
Zack killed Amos. Boyett told him to.

692
01:29:09,229 --> 01:29:13,523
Boyett's dead. Case closed. lt's all true.

693
01:29:13,859 --> 01:29:15,234
Now...

694
01:29:15,402 --> 01:29:21,405
- Will you work with me on this?
- lt sure is a lot of money, Howard.

695
01:29:23,369 --> 01:29:25,028
Yeah, l will.

696
01:29:28,749 --> 01:29:30,124
The truth!

697
01:30:47,035 --> 01:30:49,740
KeeP these on him.

698
01:30:49,914 --> 01:30:52,998
Hold that there.

699
01:30:53,167 --> 01:30:56,416
Use the Pressure to stoP the blood.

700
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:13,549
You'll be all right once we get you home.

701
01:31:13,729 --> 01:31:16,932
Once we get you home, you'll be all right.

702
01:31:17,107 --> 01:31:21,057
- All you need is rest.
- Stay where he can smell you,

703
01:31:21,236 --> 01:31:23,525
if that's all right.

704
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:26,899
All right.

705
01:31:29,912 --> 01:31:35,203
Change it when it gets soaked.
That's right.

706
01:31:35,375 --> 01:31:36,751
Hold on.

707
01:31:38,504 --> 01:31:40,331
You OK?

708
01:31:40,923 --> 01:31:47,127
- He'll be OK.
- He's lost a lot of blood.

709
01:31:47,763 --> 01:31:52,590
That's OK. lt's all right.

710
01:31:52,768 --> 01:31:56,386
That's a good boy.

711
01:31:56,563 --> 01:32:02,815
Just got to get you home and
get you some rest. Hold on, Chief.

712
01:32:03,278 --> 01:32:09,530
Hold on, boy. Come on, boy. Good!

713
01:32:09,702 --> 01:32:13,782
You'll be OK, Chief.
All l have to do is get you home...

714
01:32:13,956 --> 01:32:17,206
l have to get you home, so you can rest.

715
01:32:17,376 --> 01:32:20,958
You're going to be OK, Chief.

716
01:32:26,885 --> 01:32:32,128
Come on. Come on, Chief.

717
01:32:40,524 --> 01:32:41,899
That's it?

718
01:32:58,375 --> 01:32:59,917
l'm sorry.

719
01:33:23,776 --> 01:33:29,280
Wait a minute! They may not drive well,
but we try to keeP them clean.

720
01:33:29,448 --> 01:33:31,571
l'm sorry, man.

721
01:33:31,742 --> 01:33:34,696
Let's go! Come on.

722
01:33:38,707 --> 01:33:41,412
Seatbelt!

723
01:34:04,191 --> 01:34:09,398
Stolen bicycles from the high school.
How did you know to look here?

724
01:34:09,571 --> 01:34:15,444
- l'm a Professional. lt's my job to know.
- You got a tiP.

725
01:34:17,621 --> 01:34:21,785
- l got a tiP.
- You solved the case. Feel good?

726
01:34:22,459 --> 01:34:27,964
Chief! Your wife called to say, "He's out.
Get home in five or you're hamburger."

727
01:34:28,131 --> 01:34:31,002
- Need my helP?
- l can handle it.

728
01:34:31,176 --> 01:34:33,667
- Take this.
- What?

729
01:34:33,887 --> 01:34:35,963
For your throat.

730
01:34:45,649 --> 01:34:49,599
- Good luck!
- Good luck is Scott's!

731
01:34:56,118 --> 01:35:00,495
- What's going on? l'm home.
- l didn't get my naP...

732
01:35:00,664 --> 01:35:03,950
...or my ice cream,
and he set them off again.

733
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:07,833
These are nice PuPPies.
Then he gets them going!

734
01:35:08,005 --> 01:35:10,959
- l'm done!
- Where is he?

735
01:35:11,133 --> 01:35:15,462
- UPstairs... He's yours! Deal with it.
- l'll take care of it.

736
01:35:15,637 --> 01:35:19,801
A Professional veterinarian...
l told you this wouldn't work.

737
01:35:19,975 --> 01:35:22,762
- l told you!

660

was a little crooked, right?

661
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,651
And the roof wasn't straight,
but you should've seen his face.

662
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,565
When he saw that, he was so excited.

663
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,960
We played in the clubhouse all day.

664

671
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,200
One Christmas I wanted a special toy:

672
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,925
Johnny-7 OMA gun.

- No.

675
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,483
Two kids playing in the back yard.
"Johnny to Peter, enemy sighted."

676
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,762
"Roger there. Open fire."

677
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,602
Then Johnny whips out his
Johnny-7 OMA gun. Seven guns in one.

678
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,369
Thing looked like a blast.

679
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,445
But, of course, with my old man...

680

...Christmas was just another
opportunity to let me down.

got him a Johnny-7 OMA gun.

01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:04,122
I'll go over the changes. There are
three cutoff valves to the nitro.

956
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,891
Here, here, here.

957
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:09,283
The reading on the pressure gauge
should be below 50.

958
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,881
Not 70, like we told you earlier.

959
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,730
The emergency cutoff is here.

960
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,882
The primary controls are here.

961
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,927
There's a microphone inside the helmet
to alter your voice properly.

962
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,408
Procedure-wise,
it's the same as we talked about.

01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,729
Stick to that, there'll be no problems.
Questions?

I speak for everyone...

In a few moments Turbo Man will pick
a special child from the audience.

991

That child will be the winner

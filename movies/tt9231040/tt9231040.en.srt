3
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:43,340
Hey! Leave it.

4
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,477
Leave it. Leave it.

5
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:47,446
Who's there?

6
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:25,384
Cookie.

7
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:31,288
I want some of that
buffalo steak for breakfast,

8
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,390
the fried cakes.

9
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:36,526
Finished all that back
at Colter's Hell.

10
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:39,131
How about that soda bread?

11
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,469
There's none of that
left either, I'm afraid.

12
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:48,705
You find anything
out there tonight?

13
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:51,908
Uh, mushrooms,

14
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,745
digger squirrel.

15
00:10:56,515 --> 00:11:00,350
I had the squirrel,
but it got away.

16
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:02,152
Well, what's in the larder?

17
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:05,789
10 dry biscuits,
some jerky, salt.

18
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,125
Nothing else?

19
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:10,794
No.

20
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,832
It's the Cookie's job
to improvise.

21
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:19,569
This is a land of abundance,
Mr. Figowitz,

22
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:21,905
and you are charged
with finding our vittles

23
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,640
until we reach Fort Tillikum.

24
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,376
- Hold up there, mister.
- You understand that, I'm sure.

25
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:29,379
Share the wealth!

26
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:31,850
He's drinking more
than his share!

27
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:39,422
Ah, damn it! That's wasting it.

28
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:42,694
Hey!

29
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,271
Sons of bitches!

30
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:18,924
Hello?

31
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,961
You all right?

32
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:25,363
Hungry.

33
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:33,805
Your cook has retired
for the night?

34
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:40,910
I don't think so.

35
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,582
You could call him here
for a moment.

36
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:52,789
I'm the cook.

37
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,993
I see.

38
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:02,233
I've been walking
for a long time.

39
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:04,536
I might stay here awhile.

40
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,680
Wait.

41
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:46,237
You speak good English

42
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,940
for an Indian.

43
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:56,512
Uh, I'm not Indian.

44
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:57,883
I'm Chinese.

45
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:05,521
I didn't know there were
Chinese in these parts.

46
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:07,590
Everyone is here.

47
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,494
We all want that soft gold.

48
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,865
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

49
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:19,537
Trapped our share.

50
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:31,449
What's your name?

51
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:36,186
King-Lu.

52
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:38,488
That's what they call me.

53
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,160
- You?
- Otis Figowitz.

54
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,729
They call me Cookie.

55
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:48,500
Good to meet you.

56
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:58,976
There are, uh, some men
chasing me,

57
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,543
Russians.

58
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:02,148
Have you seen them?

59
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,958
Why are men chasing you?

60
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:21,464
I... might have killed
one of their friends.

61
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:27,304
Chenamus, my friend.

62
00:17:27,306 --> 00:17:30,606
They called him a thief,

63
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:33,710
and then gutted him
from neck to loin.

64
00:17:33,712 --> 00:17:35,645
I had a pistol.

65
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:40,483
I took a shot.
I got one in the neck,

66
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:43,920
and he came after me,

67
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:46,192
and I ran.

68
00:17:49,295 --> 00:17:52,562
What happened to your clothes?

69
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:55,466
I stuffed them
into hollow trees,

70
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:59,704
threw my gun
in a creek and, uh...

71
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:08,145
Come on.

72
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:10,282
You can sleep here.

73
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:33,830
When we find that whore son,

74
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:39,536
he'll never set foot
in this shit forest.

75
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,706
Okay, so what I'm hearing,
there's about two days...

76
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,842
At the most. At the most.

77
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:49,413
Midday? No.

78
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:55,121
It was then after midday
when we get there.

79
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:00,090
Move out! We got directions.

80
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:04,827
North and west to Fort Tillikum,

81
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,598
about two days journey.

82
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,101
Hit the river, head downstream,

83
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:14,505
downriver at every branch.

84
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:16,039
Oh...

85
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,407
and there's a murderer
in the woods,

86
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:18,944
so stay close.

87
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:49,672
The Russians said the elk
are gone this time of year.

88
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:51,408
And what else
did that Russian say?

89
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,477
Said the company is paying
three silver ingots

90
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:56,748
for every beaver pelt,
two copper for every muskrat.

91
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,718
And there's beer at the fort.

92
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,556
And other things.

93
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:08,691
- And women?
- More than one.

94
00:21:18,537 --> 00:21:21,737
Keep on down the river
from here one more day.

95
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,408
Hungry as hell.

96
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,943
Cookie, find me some food.

97
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:28,478
Eat your damn hand.
We'll be there tomorrow.

98
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,280
I want food tonight,

99
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:33,816
or I'm taking it out
on this one.

100
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:36,687
I'm sick of looking at this one.

101
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:39,189
Can't wait to be done with him.

102
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:42,459
Can't wait
to never see him again.

103
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:45,996
When you get
your cut at the fort,

104
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:50,200
I'll be waiting for you
outside the gates,

105
00:21:50,202 --> 00:21:53,604
waiting for you
with your sack full of silver.

106
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:56,306
- Leave him alone!
- No. No!

107
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:08,186
Fancy boots, lad.

108
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,126
Fancy boots.

109
00:27:26,905 --> 00:27:32,844
He said she'd be there
in about... in 6 months.

110
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:39,616
How much do you want for this?

111
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:40,750
This?

112
00:27:40,752 --> 00:27:46,156
- It's a deal.
- Oysters!

113
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:49,759
Clams! Oysters! Clams!

114
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:57,200
Five twists, six twists,
half off.

115
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:58,234
Those look like
Jean-Baptiste's boots!

116
00:27:58,236 --> 00:28:02,205
I think...

117
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:04,041
I like how it looks.
That's all.

118
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:06,876
- You like a flare.
- I believe.

119
00:29:06,438 --> 00:29:09,205
Five twists, six twists,
half off.

120
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:10,840
Six twists, half off.

121
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:14,479
Six twists, six twists.

122
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,997
Flowers... the flowers
are different shaped.

123
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:44,034
- Maybe it was bodies.
- Still clusters

124
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:46,903
I'm telling you, it was up
somewhere on Snake River.

125
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:50,007
- Don't know nothing.
- That's true.

126
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:51,875
- Your body knows more than your brain.
- Hold tight.

127
00:30:51,877 --> 00:30:53,409
Then they start
hitting each other in the head.

128
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:55,278
I'm getting to that.

129
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,181
Then, they start hitting
each other

130
00:30:57,183 --> 00:31:00,117
- with.
- Got the whole ship?

131
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:02,119
- We got two on the ship.
- No blocking.

132
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,155
He was under Ruby.
Lived as a slave up there

133
00:31:04,157 --> 00:31:05,755
for 3 years before he got free.

134
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:07,191
How was it, being a slave?

135
00:31:07,193 --> 00:31:08,892
He didn't like it.

136
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:20,839
Uh, whiskey please.

137
00:31:25,178 --> 00:31:27,079
- How much?
- Two.

138
00:31:36,421 --> 00:31:38,888
You know what
it's like in there.

139
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,423
No way of knowing.

140
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:45,831
That's what I saw.

141
00:31:48,968 --> 00:31:50,700
I'm telling you,
it's the first one,

142
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,972
first cow in the Territory.

143
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:59,310
Shipped it all the way up
to Saint Francisco.

144
00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:02,712
Saint Luis Obispo.

145
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:06,083
I heard Saint Francisco.

146
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:09,419
I spoke to the ferryman,

147
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:12,022
and he was the one
bringing the cow.

148
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:15,192
You need to ask
the Chief Factor about that.

149
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:18,595
Chief Factor ordered
two cows and a calf,

150
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:20,396
and that's a true story,

151
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:22,866
but the other ones
died on the way.

152
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,634
What good is one cow
to anyone?

153
00:32:24,636 --> 00:32:26,603
Cow needs a stud.

154
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:30,307
Chief Factor wants milk
in his tea

155
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:32,076
like a proper English gentleman.

156
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:34,477
Like a proper lady.

157
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:41,484
This ain't a place for cows.

158
00:32:41,486 --> 00:32:43,753
God would have put cows here
if it was.

159
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:48,691
Ah, it's no place for
white men either then, huh?

160
00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:50,894
Well, look who's here.

161
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:53,763
Brilliant William!

162
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,832
I need a few sunbeams, William.

163
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:58,168
Can you gather me up
a dozen sunbeams?

164
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,703
They're on the ground
just laying around everywhere.

165
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:03,406
- Any old beams will do.
- I'll have a beer.

166
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:05,242
Here's a question.

167
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:07,744
What does a tongue taste like?

168
00:33:07,746 --> 00:33:09,679
Do you ever think about that?

169
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:11,848
I bet you have
some distinct opinions

170
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,716
about what <i>your</i> tongue
tastes like.

171
00:33:13,718 --> 00:33:15,352
Am I right, William?

172
00:33:15,354 --> 00:33:16,786
Oh, traders all...

173
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,588
Whatcha saying there,
Brilliant William?

174
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,490
Something brilliant ain't bad.

175
00:33:20,492 --> 00:33:22,960
He's always good
for some clever opinions.

176
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:26,529
What's the difference
between a river and a lake?

177
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:28,065
You figure that one out yet?

178
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:29,599
Willy?

179
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:31,001
I'm not bothering him.

180
00:33:31,003 --> 00:33:33,137
I'm just asking him
an honest question.

181
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:35,638
What about the chicken
and the egg?

182
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,473
He knew for sure
it was a chicken

183
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:40,576
until he thought about it
from the egg's point of view.

184
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:42,947
That one really hurt
your old noggin.

185
00:33:42,949 --> 00:33:44,547
Didn't it, William?

186
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:46,649
Yep. Yep.
I think that's how you got

187
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,618
this crack in your brain bone.

188
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:56,293
Willy, better do something,
or your head is going to blow.

189
00:33:56,295 --> 00:33:59,898
You, watch him 'til I'm done.

190
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:09,774
Make some proper money, eh?

191
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,664
Coo, coo.

192
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:38,735
Coo, coo, coo.

193
00:34:38,737 --> 00:34:43,007
Coo. Coo, coo, coo.

194
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:46,012
Hello, Cookie.

195
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:50,247
Thought I might find you
here sooner or later.

196
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:55,119
I never thought
I'd ever see you again.

197
00:34:55,121 --> 00:34:57,454
I was lucky.

198
00:34:57,456 --> 00:35:00,723
Those, uh, Russian villains,

199
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:04,560
they left the country
just after I left you.

200
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:10,800
Well, here I am,

201
00:35:10,802 --> 00:35:13,571
free and easy,
right back where I was.

202
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,348
Uh, where are
all your kind friends?

203
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:30,187
Oh, they mostly went south,
some north.

204
00:35:30,189 --> 00:35:32,622
But not you.

205
00:35:32,624 --> 00:35:34,557
Not yet.

206
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,095
No one would have me.

207
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,032
And, uh, where are you
staying in the meantime?

208
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:46,769
I got a tent a mile that way,

209
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:49,106
uh, other side of the hill.

210
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:53,910
I've got a place
a mile thataway.

211
00:35:53,912 --> 00:35:57,448
Mm, I've got
a bottle there, too.

212
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,950
Mm-hmm.

213
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:04,256
Maybe you'd, uh,
like to come help me drink it.

214
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,891
Uh, of course, I would, but...

215
00:36:08,893 --> 00:36:11,361
Oh. Well, leave him.

216
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:13,030
He's fine.

217
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:19,802
He's fine.

218
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:24,607
Well, you wait here.

219
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:26,577
All right?

220
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:29,381
Your daddy will be back soon.

221
00:36:40,926 --> 00:36:44,894
- Damn it, James!
- Well, I put it there.

222
00:36:44,896 --> 00:36:48,265
I've been in these parts
close to two years now.

223
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:50,000
I've thought about leaving
more than once,

224
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:54,071
but I sense opportunity here.

225
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:56,906
Ships coming in
and out every week.

226
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:58,674
More raw materials
than anywhere I've seen,

227
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:01,080
and I've been all over.

228
00:37:15,827 --> 00:37:17,396
You've been everywhere.

229
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:24,935
I caught my first trade ship
to Canton when I was nine.

230
00:37:24,937 --> 00:37:27,538
From there, I sailed to London,

231
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,840
Africa, saw the pyramids.

232
00:37:30,842 --> 00:37:34,413
This is a land of riches,
I tell you.

233
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:44,854
I see something in this land
I haven't seen before.

234
00:37:44,856 --> 00:37:47,790
Pretty much everywhere
has been touched by now.

235
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:51,662
But this is still new,

236
00:37:51,664 --> 00:37:53,729
more nameless things around here

237
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,800
than you can shake an eel at.

238
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,309
Doesn't seem new to me,
seems old.

239
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:06,911
Mm.

240
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:26,365
Everything is old
if you look at it that way.

241
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:36,540
History isn't here yet.

242
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:41,080
It's coming, but we got here
early this time.

243
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:51,856
Maybe this time,
we can be ready for it.

244
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:56,295
We can take it on our own terms.

245
00:39:12,278 --> 00:39:16,115
It's not much to look at,
I know.

246
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:50,549
Here's to... something.

247
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:11,003
You make yourself easy.
I'll get a fire going.

248
00:43:03,342 --> 00:43:05,377
Looks better already.

249
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:10,115
Relax. Sit. Sit.

250
00:43:45,217 --> 00:43:47,653
Where are you from, Cookie?

251
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:52,289
Maryland.

252
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:57,527
- Hm, never been.
- Hmm...

253
00:43:57,529 --> 00:43:59,396
It's fine.

254
00:43:59,398 --> 00:44:01,498
I don't remember it much.

255
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,468
Not fine enough to stay, huh?

256
00:44:09,341 --> 00:44:12,043
My mother died
when I was born,

257
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:14,946
and then my father died.

258
00:44:14,948 --> 00:44:17,514
I had to move on to find work.

259
00:44:17,516 --> 00:44:21,153
Well... I never stopped moving.

260
00:44:48,714 --> 00:44:51,381
I had an idea once.
Furs are one thing,

261
00:44:51,383 --> 00:44:53,450
but there's a precious oil
in the beavers, too.

262
00:44:53,452 --> 00:44:55,352
That's worth something in China.

263
00:44:55,354 --> 00:44:58,055
They use it for medicine
over there.

264
00:44:58,057 --> 00:45:01,324
If a man could take a batch
of that precious beaver oil

265
00:45:01,326 --> 00:45:05,364
on a ship to Canton,
he could make his fortune.

266
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,735
Why don't you?

267
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:15,505
Eh, oil is in the glands.

268
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:17,975
Glands never make it back
to the fort,

269
00:45:17,977 --> 00:45:21,578
just rot away in the woods.

270
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:26,249
Anyway, I don't have
contacts in Canton.

271
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:27,484
I'm from the north.

272
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:29,552
They hate a Northerner there.

273
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:32,324
Worse than a white man to them.

274
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:40,497
What I'd really like is a farm.

275
00:45:44,603 --> 00:45:50,173
Land south of here is wide-open.

276
00:45:50,175 --> 00:45:52,277
The world wants filberts.

277
00:45:57,849 --> 00:45:59,317
Or walnuts.

278
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,624
Or almonds.

279
00:46:12,197 --> 00:46:18,368
Something you can
pick up and send,

280
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:21,304
but you can't just grow a tree.

281
00:46:21,306 --> 00:46:22,841
It takes time.

282
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:35,585
It's the getting started
that's the puzzle.

283
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:39,056
No way for a poor man to start.

284
00:46:39,058 --> 00:46:42,258
You need capital,

285
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,294
or you need
some kind of miracle.

286
00:46:44,296 --> 00:46:46,197
You need leverage.

287
00:46:50,402 --> 00:46:52,404
Or a crime.

288
00:46:58,877 --> 00:47:05,915
I'd like to open
a hotel someday,

289
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:10,353
a place for travelers.

290
00:47:10,355 --> 00:47:11,890
Or a bakery.

291
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:21,399
That's nice.

292
00:47:27,272 --> 00:47:32,442
A hotel and a bakery,

293
00:47:32,444 --> 00:47:35,645
with wild-huckleberry pies.

294
00:47:35,647 --> 00:47:39,183
You could do that here.

295
00:47:39,185 --> 00:47:42,354
Someplace warmer.

296
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:05,943
It has holes in it,

297
00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:09,646
and it looks like
the face of a man.

298
00:48:09,648 --> 00:48:12,649
It's just one black rock.

299
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:15,485
That's a weather stone.

300
00:48:15,487 --> 00:48:18,956
It makes rain, they say.

301
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:22,625
They say it was
a powerful spirit once

302
00:48:22,627 --> 00:48:26,197
and got turned into stone.

303
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:29,801
If anyone sits on it, it rains.

304
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:34,939
You really believe in that?

305
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:37,409
Uh... eh.

306
00:48:40,645 --> 00:48:43,849
I believe different things
in different places.

307
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,281
Saw a cow today.

308
00:50:24,283 --> 00:50:28,319
Hm.

309
00:50:28,321 --> 00:50:34,024
It wasn't far from
Chief Factor's house.

310
00:50:34,026 --> 00:50:37,196
- In a meadow.
- Hm.

311
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:50,606
- I'd like some of that milk.
- I-I'm not a milk drinker.

312
00:50:50,608 --> 00:50:54,577
It doesn't agree with me.

313
00:50:54,579 --> 00:50:58,648
I wouldn't drink it.

314
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:05,688
I'd use it for cookies.

315
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,826
Or scones.

316
00:51:09,828 --> 00:51:12,064
Nothing better
than buttermilk biscuits.

317
00:51:16,868 --> 00:51:21,806
I'm tired of
this flour-and-water bread.

318
00:51:41,793 --> 00:51:45,661
What else do you need
to make good biscuits, Cookie?

319
00:51:45,663 --> 00:51:50,234
Oh, flour, some sugar,

320
00:51:50,236 --> 00:51:56,008
salt, baking soda.

321
00:52:06,684 --> 00:52:10,187
How long does it take
to milk a cow?

322
00:52:10,189 --> 00:52:12,855
Not long.

323
00:52:12,857 --> 00:52:16,726
- Make much noise?
- No.

324
00:52:16,728 --> 00:52:21,131
Can cows give milk at night?

325
00:52:21,133 --> 00:52:25,137
As long as she wasn't milked
after dinner.

326
00:53:50,222 --> 00:53:54,558
I'll go up and keep an eye
on things from here.

327
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,128
Give me a lift.

328
00:54:06,305 --> 00:54:09,739
If I see anything,
I'll, uh, give a call.

329
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:13,343
- All right.
- I'll do an owl.

330
00:54:13,345 --> 00:54:15,512
I don't think
you can get up there.

331
00:54:43,642 --> 00:54:46,243
Hello.

332
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:49,379
How are you?

333
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:52,884
Didn't expect company
this late at night, did you?

334
00:54:56,956 --> 00:55:00,324
Well, here we are.

335
00:55:16,808 --> 00:55:18,776
Sorry about your husband.

336
00:55:22,214 --> 00:55:26,984
I heard he didn't make it
all the way.

337
00:55:26,986 --> 00:55:32,155
And your calf...

338
00:55:32,157 --> 00:55:39,198
it's a terrible thing. Terrible.

339
00:55:44,436 --> 00:55:51,008
But you got a nice place here.
You do.

340
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:54,480
You got a real nice
little place here, don't you?

341
00:58:26,064 --> 00:58:27,731
How much do you think
someone would pay

342
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:29,401
for a biscuit like that?

343
00:58:32,037 --> 00:58:34,039
I wish we had some honey.

344
00:58:39,044 --> 00:58:42,145
A glass of whiskey
is two silver coins.

345
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:45,715
A pickle is three.

346
00:58:45,717 --> 00:58:47,250
Men work out in the fort,

347
00:58:47,252 --> 00:58:50,556
loaded with silver and shells
and company script.

348
00:58:55,694 --> 00:58:59,095
I once saw a man spend
five good beaver pelts

349
00:58:59,097 --> 00:59:01,133
on a broken fork.

350
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:15,545
I think we should
test the waters.

351
00:59:15,547 --> 00:59:20,116
Next batch, Cookie,
we'll take to market.

352
00:59:20,118 --> 00:59:22,954
I've heard a fortune
is made on this.

353
00:59:22,956 --> 00:59:24,623
That seems dangerous.

354
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:29,528
So is anything worth doing.

355
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:36,401
I think they'd like
something sweeter.

356
01:00:29,488 --> 01:00:32,389
Five twists,
six twists half off.

357
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:37,129
Six twists, half off.
Six twists, six twists.

358
01:01:00,385 --> 01:01:02,485
Fresh Oily Cakes.

359
01:01:02,487 --> 01:01:04,588
Best this side
of the Sandwich Islands.

360
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:07,925
Don't look like hardtack.
Or soda bread.

361
01:01:07,927 --> 01:01:10,594
Look like some
kind of pancake.

362
01:01:10,596 --> 01:01:13,165
It smells good. What's in it?

363
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:19,269
Secret ingredient.
Ancient Chinese secret.

364
01:01:19,271 --> 01:01:20,704
How much?

365
01:01:20,706 --> 01:01:22,974
Uh, five ingots
or the equal in trade.

366
01:01:22,976 --> 01:01:24,476
Mm.

367
01:01:37,322 --> 01:01:40,759
Good lord! Give me another.

368
01:01:48,034 --> 01:01:50,669
- That's 11, all right.
- Mmm.

369
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:55,138
I'll give you six ingots
for that last one.

370
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,506
Uh-uh. Mm, mm.

371
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,475
- Seven shells.
- Come on.

372
01:01:58,477 --> 01:02:01,313
- Seven shells, one ingot.
- Wait, lads. Hold on.

373
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:15,225
Oily cake to this gentleman.

374
01:02:15,227 --> 01:02:16,929
We'll have more tomorrow.

375
01:03:16,189 --> 01:03:21,391
Made some oily cakes
with your milk.

376
01:03:21,393 --> 01:03:23,326
They were very good.

377
01:03:23,328 --> 01:03:25,497
Couldn't sell them fast enough.

378
01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:34,738
A little honey, um,

379
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,642
or it was your milk
in the batter that did it.

380
01:03:42,848 --> 01:03:49,019
Yeah, yeah.

381
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:52,491
What a good, sweet girl you are.

382
01:03:57,196 --> 01:03:59,429
Hold my place.
I'll be right back.

383
01:04:05,504 --> 01:04:08,371
- No cuts allowed.
- I was here.

384
01:04:08,373 --> 01:04:11,942
He was saving my spot.

385
01:04:11,944 --> 01:04:13,244
One is the limit.

386
01:04:13,246 --> 01:04:15,447
I heard it from
the Chinaman himself.

387
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:22,987
First come,
first served, friends.

388
01:04:52,384 --> 01:04:54,386
You ought to make
more next time.

389
01:04:56,721 --> 01:05:00,590
Only so many
we can make in a day, friend.

390
01:05:00,592 --> 01:05:02,059
They want
to keep them prices up.

391
01:05:02,061 --> 01:05:03,361
They're not dumb.

392
01:05:15,907 --> 01:05:17,507
Damn it.
What's in these things?

393
01:05:17,509 --> 01:05:19,709
Tastes like something
my mama made.

394
01:05:19,711 --> 01:05:21,444
That's our secret, boys.

395
01:05:21,446 --> 01:05:23,915
Think of it
as a little taste of home.

396
01:05:34,193 --> 01:05:36,828
We'll have more tomorrow.

397
01:05:55,147 --> 01:05:59,582
Could buy an acre
in California for that.

398
01:05:59,584 --> 01:06:01,818
It's a start, all right.

399
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:05,055
It won't last
much longer, though.

400
01:06:05,057 --> 01:06:08,926
They'll get tired of it,

401
01:06:08,928 --> 01:06:13,730
and there will be more
milk cows here soon.

402
01:06:13,732 --> 01:06:18,969
We got a window here, Cookie.

403
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:21,205
This is too much
to keep in the house.

404
01:06:21,207 --> 01:06:24,707
We need a bank.

405
01:06:24,709 --> 01:06:27,311
What about the cottonwood tree?

406
01:06:27,313 --> 01:06:30,314
There's a good hole in that.

407
01:06:30,316 --> 01:06:32,084
Hmm...

408
01:06:49,302 --> 01:06:52,835
Which side of the tree
has the most branches?

409
01:06:52,837 --> 01:06:56,040
- Huh?
- The outside.

410
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:48,160
Hey.

411
01:07:51,397 --> 01:07:53,496
Hold one out today.

412
01:07:53,498 --> 01:07:55,299
Chief Factor wants one.

413
01:07:55,301 --> 01:07:57,269
He'll be here soon.

414
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:06,377
Don't you have work to do?

415
01:08:06,379 --> 01:08:08,946
I don't need two shadows, do I?

416
01:08:08,948 --> 01:08:10,715
Get busy.

417
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:30,202
Look alive, son.

418
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:43,715
I'm saving mine for later.

419
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,919
No one is giving him
50 shells.

420
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:53,589
That ain't worth 50 shells.

421
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:58,395
I've heard about your cakes.
I'd like to try one if I may.

422
01:08:58,397 --> 01:09:01,331
How much?

423
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:04,636
For you, only 10 silver pieces.

424
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,240
A little cinnamon is nice.

425
01:10:18,177 --> 01:10:20,146
I taste London in this cake.

426
01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:28,954
A bakery I once knew
in South Kensington.

427
01:10:33,025 --> 01:10:36,095
Astonishing.

428
01:10:41,666 --> 01:10:44,234
Where did you learn to do that?

429
01:10:44,236 --> 01:10:48,905
I was indentured
to a baker in Boston, sir.

430
01:10:48,907 --> 01:10:52,409
He taught me the trade.

431
01:10:52,411 --> 01:10:56,881
- He was a good baker.
- Indeed, he was.

432
01:10:59,851 --> 01:11:01,518
What was his name?

433
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,821
Barnaby Rose.

434
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:09,493
Never heard of him,

435
01:11:09,495 --> 01:11:11,228
but I commend you, sir,

436
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:16,368
on these delicious
baked comestibles.

437
01:11:19,871 --> 01:11:22,007
I hope you won't
be leaving too soon.

438
01:11:25,611 --> 01:11:27,346
We have no plans.

439
01:11:30,449 --> 01:11:33,684
Very, very good.

440
01:11:40,758 --> 01:11:42,725
Hotel in Saint Francisco

441
01:11:42,727 --> 01:11:46,764
is harder, more competition.

442
01:11:50,868 --> 01:11:54,571
Eh, but more opportunity, too,

443
01:11:54,573 --> 01:11:57,042
more people coming through.

444
01:11:59,545 --> 01:12:02,778
If it's good idea,

445
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:06,083
we'll have enough
to go there soon.

446
01:12:06,085 --> 01:12:09,720
We have enough to go now.

447
01:12:09,722 --> 01:12:13,957
Enough to go
but not enough to start.

448
01:12:26,272 --> 01:12:28,238
Psst.

449
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,874
Psst!

450
01:12:31,377 --> 01:12:34,177
Another cup is
another dozen cakes.

451
01:12:34,179 --> 01:12:37,316
That's another 60 silver pieces
at least.

452
01:13:03,676 --> 01:13:06,842
Hello?

453
01:13:06,844 --> 01:13:09,279
Good evening.

454
01:13:09,281 --> 01:13:10,848
Back again.

455
01:14:03,202 --> 01:14:07,604
I-I'm entertaining, uh,
a small group next week.

456
01:14:07,606 --> 01:14:11,341
Captain Ruby is coming for tea,

457
01:14:11,343 --> 01:14:13,677
and I'm tired of all his jests

458
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,815
about the savagery
of life on the frontier.

459
01:14:18,817 --> 01:14:20,717
Tell me.

460
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:23,587
Do you know what a clafoutis is?

461
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:25,956
- I do.
- Hmm...

462
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:28,625
And could you make one,
a-a good one?

463
01:14:28,627 --> 01:14:32,629
He loves a clafoutis,
and, well, I...

464
01:14:32,631 --> 01:14:35,265
I'd like to humiliate him.

465
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:39,770
Well, without fresh
raspberries or apricots,

466
01:14:39,772 --> 01:14:41,872
I'm not sure.

467
01:14:41,874 --> 01:14:45,375
Have you tried bilberry?

468
01:14:45,377 --> 01:14:49,212
It's out of season, I believe.

469
01:14:49,214 --> 01:14:51,648
We have plenty of blueberries
on the bush.

470
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:53,483
I-I would pay you handsomely

471
01:14:53,485 --> 01:14:57,322
for a proper
blueberry clafoutis.

472
01:15:04,096 --> 01:15:06,763
It's a simple enough recipe.

473
01:15:06,765 --> 01:15:10,734
If blueberry is available,
I'm sure I can make one.

474
01:15:10,736 --> 01:15:12,068
Capital.

475
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:16,139
Saturday, then, a clafoutis,

476
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:17,908
and we'll be dining
at my residence.

477
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:19,976
You know its whereabouts?

478
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:22,479
Uh, uh, I think
I've passed by it

479
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:25,949
or I know of it.

480
01:15:25,951 --> 01:15:27,519
Teatime.

481
01:16:05,657 --> 01:16:10,160
The hotels in
Saint Francisco are grand.

482
01:16:10,162 --> 01:16:15,332
We can't compete on that scale,

483
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:20,170
and regular travelers
need shelter, too.

484
01:16:20,172 --> 01:16:24,908
A room with a bed, that's all,

485
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:27,112
a few rooms near the sea.

486
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:04,314
This is a dangerous game
we're playing here,

487
01:17:04,316 --> 01:17:08,785
and Chief Factor
has a delicate palate.

488
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:11,623
He'll taste his milk
in there eventually.

489
01:17:34,713 --> 01:17:37,247
We can't say no.

490
01:17:37,249 --> 01:17:41,217
He'd be suspicious.

491
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:44,454
Where does he think
the milk is coming from?

492
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:51,261
Some people can't imagine
being stolen from.

493
01:17:51,263 --> 01:17:52,864
Too strong.

494
01:17:58,604 --> 01:18:00,806
Let's hope he's one of those.

495
01:18:04,476 --> 01:18:11,717
How much will we charge, 20, 25?

496
01:18:32,604 --> 01:18:36,974
That sounds like quite
a situation indeed,

497
01:18:36,976 --> 01:18:41,811
and in the end, how...
How many lashes did you order?

498
01:18:41,813 --> 01:18:45,248
20.

499
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:49,185
Hmm...
A fine number, but for mutiny...

500
01:18:49,187 --> 01:18:52,089
It was a memorable day
for that man.

501
01:18:52,091 --> 01:18:55,625
it seems conservative.

502
01:18:55,627 --> 01:18:57,460
More than 20 and
he would have been useless

503
01:18:57,462 --> 01:18:59,329
for the remainder of the voyage.

504
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:03,600
- And he was a young hand?
- Mm, not so young.

505
01:19:03,602 --> 01:19:05,502
Ah.

506
01:19:05,504 --> 01:19:07,637
Here is the rub, you see.

507
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:11,775
When one factors the loss of
labor from the punished hand

508
01:19:11,777 --> 01:19:13,610
versus the gain of labor

509
01:19:13,612 --> 01:19:17,014
from those hands
who witness the punishment,

510
01:19:17,016 --> 01:19:23,520
a stricter punishment
can be the more advisable path.

511
01:19:23,522 --> 01:19:25,522
Even a properly-rendered death

512
01:19:25,524 --> 01:19:28,525
can be useful
in the ultimate accounting.

513
01:19:28,527 --> 01:19:32,796
It is a highly-motivating
spectacle for the indolent,

514
01:19:32,798 --> 01:19:36,100
let alone the mutinous.

515
01:19:36,102 --> 01:19:37,734
Yes, fair enough, but...

516
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:40,804
some calculations
can never truly be made.

517
01:19:40,806 --> 01:19:44,340
Now, there you
are wrong, Captain.

518
01:19:44,342 --> 01:19:45,809
Any question that cannot

519
01:19:45,811 --> 01:19:48,981
be calculated
is not worth the asking.

520
01:19:50,983 --> 01:19:53,817
Ah. Here is our baker.

521
01:19:53,819 --> 01:19:58,254
Uh, bring the clafoutis
in... in here, Cookie.

522
01:19:58,256 --> 01:20:00,425
Show the captain.

523
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:21,711
Indeed, it is
a fine-looking cake, Mister...

524
01:20:21,713 --> 01:20:24,115
Figowitz.

525
01:20:24,117 --> 01:20:28,185
And what brought you to the
Oregon Territory, Mr. Figowitz?

526
01:20:28,187 --> 01:20:31,488
Oh, chance.

527
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:33,356
I hired on
with a trapping company.

528
01:20:33,358 --> 01:20:37,494
- Ah, Ashley's men.
- No, a lesser crew.

529
01:20:37,496 --> 01:20:39,763
They're trapping out
the whole map.

530
01:20:39,765 --> 01:20:41,664
There won't be any pelts here
much longer.

531
01:20:41,666 --> 01:20:45,938
I disagree.
The beaver here are endless.

532
01:20:47,272 --> 01:20:50,907
Smart animals, the beaver.

533
01:20:50,909 --> 01:20:54,145
When I got here,
the beaver were everywhere,

534
01:20:54,147 --> 01:20:56,046
whole cities of beaver

535
01:20:56,048 --> 01:20:58,515
living like people
in row houses in New York.

536
01:21:02,287 --> 01:21:03,686
Well, in any case,

537
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:05,288
the fashions are changing
in Paris.

538
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:09,692
The beaver hat is on the wane.

539
01:21:09,694 --> 01:21:12,495
The... The Chinese market
remains strong.

540
01:21:12,497 --> 01:21:14,330
Beaver will always find a home.

541
01:21:14,332 --> 01:21:16,967
It is too beautiful, too supple.

542
01:21:16,969 --> 01:21:19,170
Hmm. Mm.

543
01:21:19,172 --> 01:21:21,005
Ah.

544
01:21:21,007 --> 01:21:24,541
Wh-What he's saying is
that the men in Paris

545
01:21:24,543 --> 01:21:28,311
favor new hats this season.

546
01:21:28,313 --> 01:21:31,381
They no longer want beaver fur.

547
01:21:39,491 --> 01:21:41,558
But... But I'm saying to him

548
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:46,065
that the beaver here
will last forever.

549
01:22:24,402 --> 01:22:25,970
He's saying
he doesn't understand

550
01:22:25,972 --> 01:22:27,670
why the white men
hunt so much beaver

551
01:22:27,672 --> 01:22:29,572
and never eat the tail.

552
01:22:29,574 --> 01:22:32,475
- The tail is delicious.
- Huh.

553
01:22:32,477 --> 01:22:33,978
Well, maybe I will.

554
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:36,113
I'm sick to death
of salmon already.

555
01:22:40,652 --> 01:22:42,385
You can tell him that.

556
01:22:42,387 --> 01:22:45,455
Ah, here we are.

557
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:50,896
Chinese black tea, very subtle.

558
01:22:53,498 --> 01:22:54,934
Uh, cream?

559
01:23:00,705 --> 01:23:03,173
Enjoy the cream, Captain.

560
01:23:03,175 --> 01:23:04,908
My cow gives so little.

561
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:07,644
She's a lonely girl, I fear.

562
01:23:07,646 --> 01:23:10,580
- You have a cow?
- Yes. She's only been here

563
01:23:10,582 --> 01:23:13,650
for a month or so,
sans husband, I'm afraid.

564
01:23:13,652 --> 01:23:16,721
I'm hoping to find her
a mate within the year.

565
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:23,160
Would you like to see her?

566
01:23:23,162 --> 01:23:24,997
Let... Let's take a walk.

567
01:23:26,198 --> 01:23:27,632
Shall we?

568
01:24:03,369 --> 01:24:06,036
Tell me, Captain,

569
01:24:06,038 --> 01:24:10,107
what are the fashions in Paris
this year?

570
01:24:10,109 --> 01:24:11,908
Hmm...

571
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:16,213
The ladies are moving away from
the Empire silhouette this year.

572
01:24:16,215 --> 01:24:22,186
They're favoring fuller skirts
and, uh, visible corseting.

573
01:24:22,188 --> 01:24:25,922
For the men, broad shoulders
and puffed sleeves,

574
01:24:25,924 --> 01:24:28,058
trousers for smart day wear,

575
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:31,861
britches and cordon
in the country.

576
01:24:31,863 --> 01:24:36,033
As for colors, canary yellow
and turkey red

577
01:24:36,035 --> 01:24:38,801
are the colors <i>du jour.</i>

578
01:24:38,803 --> 01:24:41,704
History moves so quickly
in Paris.

579
01:24:41,706 --> 01:24:44,341
So quickly,
it wears itself out.

580
01:24:44,343 --> 01:24:47,510
It never reaches here at all.

581
01:25:14,206 --> 01:25:17,074
She seems well enough.

582
01:25:17,076 --> 01:25:18,976
Yes.

583
01:25:18,978 --> 01:25:22,845
And yet she barely
produces a thing.

584
01:25:22,847 --> 01:25:26,849
- What's her provenance?
- Oh, she's of a good line,

585
01:25:26,851 --> 01:25:31,522
half Alderney
and half from Froment du Leon

586
01:25:31,524 --> 01:25:33,390
from the province of Brittany.

587
01:25:48,606 --> 01:25:53,345
She's a very fine cow.

588
01:26:03,456 --> 01:26:07,890
Froment du Leon
from the province of Brittany.

589
01:26:07,892 --> 01:26:11,661
The cow has got
better breeding than I do.

590
01:26:11,663 --> 01:26:13,631
A royal cow.

591
01:26:16,936 --> 01:26:19,238
Maybe we should halt
for a while.

592
01:26:22,841 --> 01:26:28,245
I think the Captain
sensed something.

593
01:26:28,247 --> 01:26:31,014
Hm. Now is our time.

594
01:26:31,016 --> 01:26:33,050
Another cow is on the way.
And more cows after that.

595
01:26:33,052 --> 01:26:37,087
- And Chief Factor is...
- Is a fool.

596
01:26:37,089 --> 01:26:40,656
He misses everything
right under his nose.

597
01:26:40,658 --> 01:26:44,394
Paris this, London that.

598
01:26:44,396 --> 01:26:45,663
What kind of woman is he?

599
01:26:50,102 --> 01:26:55,372
Men like us, Cookie,
we have to make our own way.

600
01:26:55,374 --> 01:27:00,944
There are no Empire silhouettes
or colors <i>du jour</i> for us.

601
01:27:00,946 --> 01:27:03,915
We have to take what we can
when the taking is good.

602
01:27:09,088 --> 01:27:10,422
I know.

603
01:27:13,392 --> 01:27:14,724
We'll sell a little longer,

604
01:27:14,726 --> 01:27:16,728
and then we'll make
our way south.

605
01:27:20,933 --> 01:27:24,103
We haven't even begun, Cookie.

606
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,930
Psst, psst, psst, psst, psst!

607
01:30:42,034 --> 01:30:44,101
Come on back.

608
01:30:44,103 --> 01:30:47,903
Come on back, you stupid cat!

609
01:30:47,905 --> 01:30:49,641
Inside, before you get me
in trouble.

610
01:31:14,867 --> 01:31:16,366
Aah!

611
01:31:30,849 --> 01:31:32,616
Are you all right?

612
01:31:32,618 --> 01:31:36,919
Mm.

613
01:31:36,921 --> 01:31:39,489
- Can you move?
- Yeah. Yeah.

614
01:31:39,491 --> 01:31:41,059
We got to go.

615
01:31:44,229 --> 01:31:45,395
Something...
Someone in the meadow!

616
01:31:45,397 --> 01:31:47,030
- What?
- Attackers all around!

617
01:31:47,032 --> 01:31:48,899
- What?
- I woke the house! Get dressed.

618
01:31:48,901 --> 01:31:50,669
Hurry!

619
01:32:06,084 --> 01:32:08,187
God's sake, Thomas!

620
01:32:10,522 --> 01:32:12,357
You there!

621
01:33:11,016 --> 01:33:15,721
It would appear that someone
has been milking your cow.

622
01:33:26,865 --> 01:33:33,171
Figowitz, the Chinaman.

623
01:33:37,643 --> 01:33:39,545
Figowitz!

624
01:33:49,154 --> 01:33:51,089
No, no. Not home.

625
01:34:29,328 --> 01:34:32,195
Which way?

626
01:34:32,197 --> 01:34:34,497
The deer path is up
back up over there,

627
01:34:34,499 --> 01:34:37,300
- but the river path is...
- Stealing my milk.

628
01:34:37,302 --> 01:34:38,802
I'll kill him!

629
01:34:38,804 --> 01:34:40,570
Shh! Do you hear that?

630
01:34:40,572 --> 01:34:42,841
What's that? What's that?

631
01:35:19,778 --> 01:35:23,513
There's one
crossing the river, sir!

632
01:35:23,515 --> 01:35:25,815
We'll overtake him on foot!

633
01:35:25,817 --> 01:35:27,384
Use the path downriver!

634
01:35:27,386 --> 01:35:30,489
Lloyd, you hurry on,
and we'll... we'll follow!

635
01:35:32,157 --> 01:35:33,825
Yes, sir!

636
01:37:09,688 --> 01:37:11,821
Lehayim.

637
01:37:11,823 --> 01:37:13,023
Lehayim.

638
01:37:13,025 --> 01:37:16,394
I-Is this your canoe?
I need to go downriver.

639
01:38:04,243 --> 01:38:07,610
Din-din-din.

640
01:38:07,612 --> 01:38:09,345
Ding-a-ling-a-ling?

641
01:38:09,347 --> 01:38:11,314
Mm.

642
01:39:44,676 --> 01:39:47,712
I need to find my friend.

643
01:40:14,472 --> 01:40:16,508
And also know where I am.

644
01:45:02,727 --> 01:45:06,697
- Not even northwest.
- Ah, over here?

645
01:45:06,699 --> 01:45:09,001
- He's probably got a mustache.
- Huh?

646
01:45:49,675 --> 01:45:51,807
Aye, Johnny Hart.

647
01:45:51,809 --> 01:45:54,011
Ha!

648
01:45:55,547 --> 01:45:58,415
The home is totally
abandoned, that one.

649
01:45:58,417 --> 01:46:01,518
Heart, heart like
a red beating heart?

650
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:05,155
No, like,
uh, Hart like a deer.

651
01:46:05,157 --> 01:46:07,658
Aye.

652
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:10,327
Jon Hart...

653
01:46:10,329 --> 01:46:13,297
a cheater by any spelling.

654
01:46:13,299 --> 01:46:16,899
I've skunked him
every game, regardless.

655
01:46:16,901 --> 01:46:19,703
He's not a worthy opponent.

656
01:46:19,705 --> 01:46:23,640
He prefers to discard
just one card to the crib.

657
01:46:23,642 --> 01:46:28,278
- One card?
- Aye. Abysmal.

658
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:34,318
It's an archaic rule,

659
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:40,257
but he prefers the old ways.

660
01:46:40,259 --> 01:46:41,758
Aye.

661
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:46,330
The guy a poor adversary is on
John Suckling's noble game.

662
01:46:46,332 --> 01:46:49,199
Cribbage players are in
short supply in this hemisphere.

663
01:46:49,201 --> 01:46:50,300
Aye.

664
01:46:50,302 --> 01:46:53,005
I've suffered for it daily.

665
01:51:34,353 --> 01:51:38,788
Thought you were gone.

666
01:51:38,790 --> 01:51:41,393
I thought <i>you</i> were
gone.

667
01:51:52,638 --> 01:51:54,239
You're hurt?

668
01:51:58,011 --> 01:51:59,611
Uh...

669
01:52:03,515 --> 01:52:07,350
It's not good here, Cookie.

670
01:52:07,352 --> 01:52:09,388
It's not safe.

671
01:52:11,757 --> 01:52:13,291
We have to go.

672
01:52:14,593 --> 01:52:16,695
Get away from here.

673
01:52:24,269 --> 01:52:26,371
We'll tell our stories later.

674
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:30,640
That's quite a scratch
on your head.

675
01:52:30,642 --> 01:52:33,010
We'll clean it when we rest.

676
01:52:33,012 --> 01:52:34,947
How about that?

677
01:53:19,291 --> 01:53:22,093
There's a port
at the mouth of the river.

678
01:53:22,095 --> 01:53:24,461
We will go downstream and
catch the first clipper south.

679
01:53:24,463 --> 01:53:26,331
How about that?

680
01:53:37,275 --> 01:53:39,946
Why is a baker like a beggar?

681
01:53:43,682 --> 01:53:46,183
Why?

682
01:53:46,185 --> 01:53:48,185
They both need bread.

683
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:53,590
You'll make it.

684
01:53:53,592 --> 01:53:56,493
You just need
to stay on your feet.

685
01:55:41,033 --> 01:55:46,136
This is, uh,
a good place to rest.

686
01:55:46,138 --> 01:55:48,440
No one can see us here.

687
01:55:54,779 --> 01:55:59,083
You lie there on the needles,

688
01:55:59,085 --> 01:56:01,118
and I'll keep first watch.

689
01:57:04,383 --> 01:57:07,952
We'll go soon.

690
01:57:07,954 --> 01:57:09,521
I've got you.

691
02:01:31,294 --> 02:01:36,294

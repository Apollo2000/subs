3
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,399
Jacko!

4
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:33,967
What is all this about?

5
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,235
Don't even go there, mate.

6
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:37,070
It's almost become
like a tradition now.

7
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:39,072
It's the old festive Christmas
Eve hunt, isn't it?

8
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:41,208
Well, yeah, you've certainly
gone all out this year.

9
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:42,475
You've even got the beard
and everything!

10
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:43,876
Oh, don't worry about that.

11
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,478
That'll be gone
by dinner time.

12
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:47,380
- Why?
- Cassie hates it.

13
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:49,216
She's got a point, mate.

14
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,817
Not you and all.
I like it!

15
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,320
I see you've had a bit of luck
this year, though?

16
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:54,955
These are beauties, mate.
Look at them.

17
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:57,123
I caught the little bastards
right off-guard!

18
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,857
You caught them off-guard?

19
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,262
It's hard to imagine you
catching anything off-guard!

20
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:04,231
Don't worry, though.

21
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:05,864
There'll be plenty for you
and Lucy.

22
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,367
7:30 alright
for the pair of you, still?

23
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,102
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we'll be there.

24
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:11,504
Means I can dump my share
of Cassie's God-awful stuffing

25
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,006
right on your plate.

26
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,409
So what's in yours then,
snoopy?

27
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:18,411
- Now, this.
- Yeah?

28
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,980
This is a surprise.

29
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:20,913
Fair enough.

30
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:22,915
Well, I better get dinner
plucked, stuffed

31
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,284
- and ready for later.
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:25,986
- Catch you later.
- See you later.

33
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:28,455
Hey!

34
00:05:28,488 --> 00:05:31,091
Don't forget to leave plenty
of room on your plate.

35
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:32,325
Will do!

36
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:11,164
Babes!

37
00:06:11,197 --> 00:06:13,099
The one and only.

38
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:17,203
Oh, it's Christmas!

39
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:18,204
Almost.

40
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:21,074
I missed you.

41
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:23,476
I missed you, too,
you crazy Christmas puppy.

42
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,415
Work sucked.

43
00:06:28,448 --> 00:06:29,882
I know.

44
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:31,451
Yeah, and you?

45
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:34,187
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

46
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,889
- Not sick of the little brats then yet?
- Never!

47
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:40,093
- I love the idea of seeing them grow into little people.
- Aww.

48
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:43,096
Even more so,
over time

49
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:45,432
I get to share my wisdom
with them.

50
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:47,067
You're adorable.

51
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,469
But I give it to
the end of January

52
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:51,837
and you'll be back down
the job center.

53
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,311
So, why are you still
wearing your hat?

54
00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:02,615
- Yeah, about that...
- Yeah?

55
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:06,653
Remember when you
said ages ago

56
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:08,254
that you wanted to see
what I looked like

57
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:10,256
- with blonde hair, hmm?
- Yeah.

58
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,325
And I said I wouldn't do it
because it was stupid.

59
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:13,493
Yeah.

60
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:17,063
Well, I thought I'd
surprise you for Christmas.

61
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:19,865
But it's gone wrong!

62
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,337
Alright, yeah yeah yeah,
that's enough.

63
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:26,139
- Laugh at Jack.
- No, no, no, it's not,

64
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:27,674
it's not that bad.

65
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:28,641
- You can be...
- Really?

66
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:33,680
...my little silver freak.

67
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:35,648
We'll go with silver fox,
hmm?

68
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:39,119
My silver fox.

69
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,628
You make me really happy.

70
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,932
Ok.

71
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,667
What are you after?

72
00:07:57,337 --> 00:08:01,508
Ooh... Presents!

73
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,476
No, no, no!

74
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:06,112
Right.

75
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,048
Uh...

76
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:13,253
How am I supposed to know
which one mines is?

77
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:15,221
Is, is, is, is?

78
00:08:15,255 --> 00:08:17,157
You haven't written any
names on it, you donut.

79
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:20,427
These are for
the Hendersons.

80
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:28,368
Oh, you little spoiled brat!

81
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,036
You got the Hendersons
presents?

82
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,539
Yes, I got the Hendersons
presents!

83
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:33,740
Well, why wouldn't I?

84
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:35,675
Because I got the Hendersons
presents.

85
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,976
What?

86
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,011
Where?

87
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:39,145
Out in the hallway
in the bag

88
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,280
that I asked you for
last night

89
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:42,015
when I said "Can I have a bag
to put the presents in?"

90
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:44,317
You never said
who they were for.

91
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,552
Well, it's not like
I'm gonna get my old man

92
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:47,187
a present, is it?

93
00:08:54,394 --> 00:08:55,495
"Bag in the hallway

94
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:57,330
that you gave me last night."

95
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:08,274
Show me then,
big spender.

96
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:09,209
Alright.

97
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:10,677
Sit, puppy.

98
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:17,183
Right, close your eyes.

99
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:18,318
Really?

100
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:20,587
Where's the romance gone,
Lucy?

101
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,754
Fair enough.

102
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:28,261
Do I have to unwrap it with
my eyes closed, too, yeah?

103
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:30,230
- It's up to you.
- Cool. Ok, ok.

104
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:33,600
Ooh. Ooh.
It's quite solid.

105
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:35,502
Oh, a book maybe?

106
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:37,237
- Ok.
- Maybe.

107
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:51,618
"To the best primary school
teacher in the world.

108
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:54,654
"You've come so far
and I'm so proud

109
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,223
"of everything you've achieved.

110
00:09:57,257 --> 00:09:59,359
"The kids are gonna love you.

111
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:03,563
"Merry Christmas, all my love,

112
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:05,131
Jack."

113
00:10:05,798 --> 00:10:07,133
That's you.

114
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:14,741
You're amazing.

115
00:10:14,774 --> 00:10:17,644
I really wasn't expecting this.

116
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:19,779
I mean it.

117
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:22,348
I'm proud of you.

118
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:24,417
I love you.

119
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,585
I love you, too.

120
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:32,525
Do we really
have to go over?

121
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,130
No, but Michael's always
been so welcoming.

122
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:38,798
It would be rude not to go,
you know that.

123
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:43,236
Well, seeing as
we're doing this.

124
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,437
Ooh.

125
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,106
For you!

126
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,242
Yeah, go on!

127
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:50,476
Yeah!

128
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,356
No note?

129
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:06,125
Well, I didn't realize
you were gonna do all this!

130
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:09,128
I'm guessing
you want me to wear

131
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:11,164
this monstrosity tonight,
yeah?

132
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:12,432
Yes!

133
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:28,715
Happy?

134
00:11:37,423 --> 00:11:38,491
What?

135
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:41,694
Jack, there's something
in the garden.

136
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,131
What does it look like?

137
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:48,635
Like two little torches.
Just moving.

138
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:50,503
Little torches?
What, like borrower torches?

139
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:51,604
No, Jack, I'm serious.

140
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:52,405
Yeah, I know,

141
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:54,574
but you're not making
any sense.

142
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:58,845
- Look, I saw these two little lights.
- Whereabouts?

143
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:00,747
The bottom.
There. Like, bottom right.

144
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:03,349
Bottom right?

145
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,653
- Lucy. Bottom right?
- Yeah. Like, just there,

146
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:07,854
like two feet
from the bottom.

147
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:08,956
Like, the bottom right.

148
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:11,324
- Right, well, I'm going outside.
- No, no, no!

149
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,793
Look, I'll be back
in a minute, yeah?

150
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:40,553
<i>Be careful.</i>

151
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,602
There's nothing there,
babe.

152
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,443
The coast is clear.

153
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,002
Luce?

154
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:47,007
Lucy!

155
00:16:03,023 --> 00:16:04,457
Luce?

156
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:22,475
Luce?

157
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:32,119
Oh, my God, no!

158
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:38,158
Lucy, calm down!
Lucy! Lucy!

159
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:39,759
Lucy, calm down!

160
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,794
Lucy!
Oh, babe! Lucy!

161
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:35,048
<i>Michael?</i>

162
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:36,416
Yes, love?

163
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,584
<i>Dinner's ready
in half an hour.</i>

164
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:39,919
Ok, love.

165
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:43,889
You alright?

166
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:45,025
Yeah.

167
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:48,161
Is she...
Is she there?

168
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:50,663
- What?
- Your mum. Is she there?

169
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:52,765
Yeah, why?

170
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,908
You're a funny guy.

171
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,580
What you reading anyway,
Dad?

172
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,515
Anything that makes me
look busy.

173
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:15,588
Got it down to a tee,
I see?

174
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:17,790
You'll learn from the best.

175
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:19,658
Oh, yeah?
Who's that, then?

176

<i>...Seen as a disappointment.</i>

184
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:47,954
Well, go on then, old man!

185
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:51,657
Eric, go and get your brother
and sister, will you?

186
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,193
So lazy!

187

I know what you were doing,
you fool.

201
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:28,995
What's that supposed to mean?

202
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:33,599
You're hiding away in here

203
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,669
and you're not helping me
in the kitchen.

204
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:39,306
I'm sorry, Cass.

205
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,109
I've just had a lot
on my mind lately.

206
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:46,612
I'm not sure I can do this.

207
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:49,849
I don't think I can tell him.

208
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,086
Look, Michael,
we've talked about this.

209
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,222
I've got nothing else
to say on the matter.

210
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:03,964
Now, will you please help me
make dinner for your family?

211
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,001
I'm sorry.
Come on, then.

212
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:09,102
Let's go.

213
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,940
Get up,
you big fat lump!

214
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:16,343
- You come here, old man!
- Oh, my sore knee.

215
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:18,145
I know who needs one.

216
00:20:18,178 --> 00:20:19,912
- I'm gonna have one of your spuds.
- Don't you dare!

217
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:21,414
- I'm gonna have two of your spuds!
- No, you don't!

218
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:23,083
I'm gonna nick one
of your spuds!

219
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:30,656
It's your go.

220
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:33,692
It's your go.

221
00:20:35,428 --> 00:20:37,264
- Lauren?
- Just do it.

222
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:39,266
But it's your go.

223
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,701
Oh Ben, leave me alone
for one minute, would you?

224
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,704
Sorry.

225
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:51,444
Hello?

226
00:20:51,478 --> 00:20:52,912
<i>Hey, can you talk?</i>

227
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:54,147
Yeah.

228
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:55,814
I miss you.

229
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:57,984
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

230
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:59,219
<i>Sorry I couldn't come.</i>

231
00:20:59,252 --> 00:21:00,786
That's ok.

232
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:02,289
We've got Boxing Day.

233
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,057
<i>Yeah.</i>

234
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,325
<i>How was dinner?</i>

235
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,826
Haven't had it yet.

236
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:09,862
<i>Oh, right.</i>

237
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:12,165
<i>Listen.</i>

238
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,934
<i>I'm really sorry I've been
a bit over the top</i>

239
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:15,368
<i>recently with everything.</i>

240
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:18,238
<i>I just feel like
time's running out.</i>

241
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:23,376
<i>What I'm trying to say is
that you make me happy.</i>

242
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:29,349
<i>I see how close you and your
family have gotten this year</i>

243
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:31,784
<i>and I kinda just
want that with you.</i>

244
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:34,054
<i>Babe?</i>

245
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:35,222
<i>Lauren, you there?</i>

246
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:37,357
You're so cute.

247
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,528
I'm just confused
about it all.

248
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:43,829
I don't know
if I even want this.

249
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:50,170
I feel a bit suffocated
with everything.

250
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:52,973
<i>Like what?</i>

251
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:56,243
I just like things
the way they are.

252
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:58,111
Don't you?

253
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:00,547
<i>Of course I do, but...</i>

254
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,949
<i>You know what?
I'm sorry.</i>

255
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:03,916
<i>You're right.</i>

256
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,353
<i>Look, you go
and enjoy your evening.</i>

257
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:08,021
<i>I'll say no more on this.</i>

258
00:22:08,054 --> 00:22:10,423
<i>The ball's in your court
and we'll leave it at that.</i>

259
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:11,890
<i>I can wait until you're ready.</i>

260
00:22:11,924 --> 00:22:14,327
<i>I ain't going anywhere, ok?</i>

261
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:16,096
Thank you.

262
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:17,964
<i>I'll see you tomorrow, ok?</i>

263
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:20,300
See you tomorrow.

264
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,834
Bye.

265
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:23,203
<i>Bye.</i>

266
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:28,441
Confused about what,
Lauren?

267
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:33,413
Nothing.

268
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:37,117
- It's your go.
- Guys!

269
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,519
You're such a moron.

270
00:22:39,552 --> 00:22:40,520
Come and play, Eric!

271
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:42,155
Yeah, Eric, come and play.

272
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:43,922
Nah, food's almost ready.

273
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:44,857
Ok, moron.

274
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,526
Oi you, come here!

275
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:50,597
Did you build your swing?

276
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,665
No.

277
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:53,566
I got the rope over
but the branch is too high.

278
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,268
I need you to help me tie it.

279
00:22:55,935 --> 00:22:57,237
Eric, put him down.

280
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,172
Maybe I'll help you
with it tomorrow.

281
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:01,341
Always a pleasure
coming home for Christmas!

282
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:30,103
Hey.

283
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:32,472
How d'ya feel, Cassie?

284
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:34,207
Yeah, fine.

285
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:37,010
Great.

286
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:39,979
Well, that's a meal and a movie
next week then

287
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:41,581
if I can get a sitter?

288
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:43,450
Yeah, well, take me
to the theatre

289
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:45,385
- and I'm all yours!
- Done.

290
00:23:45,985 --> 00:23:48,321
I'll see if I can call
Nancy on Friday.

291
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:50,156
When's dinner, Mum?
Ben's starving!

292
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,591
Put him down, love.

293
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:53,960
Blame dad, he did that
to me all the time.

294
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:55,662
Difference is,
you used to cry.

295
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:57,630
Yeah, well, that's why
we don't do it any more,

296
00:23:57,664 --> 00:23:58,631
right, Michael?

297
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:00,899
I used to hold you up
by your feet, actually.

298
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:02,235
Hence the crying.

299
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:03,937
I'm sitting next to mum!

300
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,239
Go on,
I'll deal with you later.

301
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:09,042
Oh Michael,
I forgot to do the onions.

302
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:13,113
Not the onions!
Oh, God, no!

303
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:16,216
Chill out,
enjoy your drink.

304
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:17,517
Jesus!

305
00:24:24,124 --> 00:24:26,960
Right on time, come in!

306
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:36,002
We're through here, Luce.

307
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:56,022
How's it going?

308
00:25:19,546 --> 00:25:22,315
Oh, Lucy,
how lovely to see you!

309
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:25,985
How are you?

310
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:27,454
How are you?

311
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,755
I'm good.

312
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:31,324
Yeah, I'm great, actually!

313
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:33,726
Oh, Lucy, would you mind
helping me with this?

314
00:25:35,295 --> 00:25:38,031
I completely forgot to put them
in with the pheasants.

315
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:17,670
You're gonna love this,
mate.

316
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:27,247
Hey?

317
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,149
Now, what you're looking at
is a broken-down old relic.

318
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:33,319
But I look at this
and I see my old dad.

319
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:37,724
Well, that's all I've got left
to remember him by.

320
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:39,726
My inheritance.

321
00:26:41,828 --> 00:26:43,696
Do you know, every Friday
I'd come home from school,

322
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,465
and me and my dad would sit
in front of this thing

323
00:26:45,498 --> 00:26:47,066
and we'd watch our
favorite shows

324
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,635
right up to the early hours.

325
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:52,105
Loved spending time together,
we did.

326
00:26:53,506 --> 00:26:54,274
Do you know I can't
even remember

327
00:26:54,307 --> 00:26:56,109
what half the shows
were about?

328
00:26:58,745 --> 00:27:01,781
It's just that we enjoyed
each other's company.

329
00:27:05,118 --> 00:27:07,654
They're the times
I remember the best.

330
00:27:11,658 --> 00:27:13,293
The old man lost
most of his money

331
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:15,395
when the coal mines closed.

332
00:27:15,428 --> 00:27:17,630
They had to sell everything
to make ends meet,

333
00:27:17,664 --> 00:27:19,499
apart from this.

334
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:24,804
I want to leave this
to my boy.

335
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:29,142
I ain't gonna be around
forever, am I?

336
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:32,245
I just hope that it means as
much to him as it does to me.

337
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:39,352
You're right.
It's broken.

338
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:48,428
But I'm gonna fix it.

339
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:56,769
I want to fix it.

340
00:27:58,438 --> 00:28:00,306
There's no inheritance
for us.

341
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:06,212
We'll take what we can get.

342
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:09,716
Oh, Jack.

343
00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:13,486
I'm so sorry.

344
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,356
Ignore me,
I'm not thinking straight.

345
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:18,491
Hey. Lucy.

346
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,630
Jack, I know you wanted
to see this earlier.

347
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,568
Now there's a toy
with purpose.

348
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:34,641
You like?

349
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:38,678
She's a bloody beauty,
isn't she, son?

350
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:40,513
Excuse my language, Lucy.

351
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,548
Do you know what?

352
00:28:42,582 --> 00:28:45,718
If those new safety windows
don't keep intruders out,

353
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:47,854
- this thing definitely will.
- <i>Michael?</i>

354
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:50,356
Oh.

355
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,624
Food.

356
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,778
<i>Go on through, guys,
the kids are in the living room.</i>

357
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:27,760
Are they ok?

358
00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:29,829
Yeah, I think so.

359
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:31,631
It's just awkward,
isn't it?

360
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:35,334
I mean,

361
00:29:35,368 --> 00:29:37,870
Christmas should be spent
with your family,

362
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:38,939
shouldn't it?

363
00:29:38,972 --> 00:29:40,873
- Poor boy.
- I know.

364
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:42,508
I don't think I could
have shaken it off

365
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:43,743
if I'd have been
in his shoes.

366
00:29:43,776 --> 00:29:45,411
Yeah.

367
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:48,414
Let's just try to make them
feel as welcome as possible.

368
00:29:48,448 --> 00:29:49,582
That's all we can do,
isn't it?

369
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:50,917
Of course.

370
00:29:56,522 --> 00:29:57,824
I give it five years.

371
00:29:57,857 --> 00:29:59,392
Dad's got a full
head of hair.

372
00:29:59,425 --> 00:29:59,960
Almost.

373
00:29:59,993 --> 00:30:01,294
Lauren, don't scare him.

374
00:30:01,327 --> 00:30:02,595
Doesn't matter,
it skips a gen.

375
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:03,964
Look, you're receding already.

376
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:05,364
Get off!
Lauren!

377
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:06,766
Anyway,
I'm not scared, old man.

378
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,468
- Lauren's wrong, though.
- We'll see.

379
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:09,802
Children.

380
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:10,971
Will I go bald, Mum?

381
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:12,672
Oh, kids, please!

382
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,409
Lauren, how's Matt?

383
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:19,779
Fine.

384
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:20,747
What dad meant was,

385
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,515
how are you doing
as an intimate couple?

386
00:30:22,548 --> 00:30:24,283
None of your business,
loner.

387
00:30:24,317 --> 00:30:26,385
Date nights,
intimacy, pregnancy.

388
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:27,720
Eric, shut up!

389
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:31,724
Eric, don't pea
on your sister!

390
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:33,593
- My little baby girl?
- Mum!

391
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:35,528
- You're not actually pregnant, are you?
- No!

392
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:36,529
Could be.

393
00:30:36,562 --> 00:30:38,698
Eric, stop teasing
your sister.

394
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:43,803
So why didn't he
want to come tonight?

395
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:46,606
Why would he?

396
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:47,874
He proposed, Mum!

397
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:49,275
Did he really?

398
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:52,012
- No?
- Such a dick.

399
00:30:53,981 --> 00:30:55,015
Right.

400
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:56,382
I'm fine.

401
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:57,517
Matt's fine.

402
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,618
We're not pregnant,

403
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:00,419
nor are we engaged.

404
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:01,587
Aw, disappointing.

405
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:04,091
Says the single, friendless,
twenty-nine year old mong.

406
00:31:04,124 --> 00:31:05,591
- Love you.
- Yuck.

407
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,659
My kids!

408
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,331
Dad, I'm sorry

409
00:31:12,365 --> 00:31:14,433
but he's with
his parents tonight.

410
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:15,568
Well, that's a shame.

411
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:17,336
Dad loves his guests.

412
00:31:18,704 --> 00:31:20,107
The more the merrier.

413
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,575
But you two are happy,
yes, love?

414
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:24,811
Yeah.

415
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:26,379
Yeah.

416
00:31:26,412 --> 00:31:27,480
And if you must know

417
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:29,916
we have been talking
about the idea of marriage.

418
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,818
- Oh, Lauren!
- No, no, no, Mum.

419
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:34,787
No, stop! Stop it!

420
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:36,856
Another excuse
to use the shotgun.

421
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:39,692
- Oh, Michael Henderson!
- Merry Christmas, sis.

422
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:40,760
A bit harsh, Dad!

423
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:42,595
Alright, we're only playing.

424
00:31:42,628 --> 00:31:45,364
Yeah, but why is it always
at my expense?

425
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:47,100
I'm sorry.

426
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:51,804
In all seriousness, Lauren,

427
00:31:53,073 --> 00:31:54,640
no, we're thrilled for you.
We really are.

428
00:31:54,674 --> 00:31:55,708
We're so proud,

429
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:58,778
and I want you to know that
we love Matt. We do.

430
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:00,680
We wanted both of you
to know that.

431
00:32:00,713 --> 00:32:01,547
Yeah, we love Matt.

432
00:32:01,581 --> 00:32:04,851
We've just talked about
the idea of it.

433
00:32:04,884 --> 00:32:06,752
We're not there yet, ok?

434
00:32:06,786 --> 00:32:09,722
You take as long as you need,
love, alright?

435
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:12,059
We just want our little girl
to be happy.

436
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:13,726
She's so happy.

437
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,162
No, I'm with your mum
on this one.

438
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:16,863
As long as you're happy.

439
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:19,799
Thanks, Dad.

440
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:23,569
And if the time comes,

441
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:25,538
you know we're right
behind you.

442
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,807
You'll have our backing,
financially, as well.

443
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:32,678
Ok, thank you both.

444
00:32:32,712 --> 00:32:35,514
But can we stop talking about
my private life, please?

445
00:32:35,548 --> 00:32:36,682
Aw.

446
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:40,553
Sorry.

447
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:43,422
Lucy, how's the food?

448
00:32:47,727 --> 00:32:50,529
So, can I have your attention
for a moment, please?

449
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:52,065
I've got an announcement
to make.

450
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:53,066
You have?

451
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,968
Can you even
still have babies?

452
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:56,203
Babies on the mind?

453
00:32:56,236 --> 00:32:58,704
I assure you,
it all still works down there.

454
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:00,439
Dad, that's gross.

455
00:33:00,473 --> 00:33:01,774
Divorce?

456
00:33:02,175 --> 00:33:04,978
I'll divorce you in a minute,
you little smart-ass.

457
00:33:05,012 --> 00:33:07,446
Just pipe down,
alright, guys?

458
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:11,151
Stop!
Oh, you're disgusting.

459
00:33:13,153 --> 00:33:14,887
Sorry, Mum.
Go on.

460
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:23,063
So you all know
that it's been seven months

461
00:33:23,096 --> 00:33:25,198
since I was diagnosed

462
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:27,733
with a very low chance
of survival.

463
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:30,870
Mum?

464
00:33:31,837 --> 00:33:34,740
Honey, can't we talk
about this tomorrow?

465
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:36,742
Please.

466
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:38,477
We haven't been together
in so long

467
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:40,680
and I need to get this
off my chest.

468
00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:47,087
So, the doctors,
God bless them,

469
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,821
they did say
right at the beginning

470
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:52,692
that the success rates
for chemo were very low.

471
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,097
They offered me
so much support,

472
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,531
and they were very thorough

473
00:33:58,564 --> 00:33:59,967
with the information
they gave me.

474
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,567
The options I had,

475
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,205
and my life expectancy
with or without the chemo.

476
00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:09,542
It's no surprise
that I chose the chemo

477
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:13,113
because they told me I'd last
about eight weeks without it,

478
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:15,949
- and it's been...
- Seven months.

479
00:34:15,983 --> 00:34:17,817
You look amazing, Mum.

480
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,053
Let your mother speak, son.

481
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:21,754
Eric, it's ok.

482
00:34:25,258 --> 00:34:32,832
So, chemo is rarely the answer.
It just prolongs life,

483
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:39,139
and sometimes that's not
necessarily the right answer.

484
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,744
It just puts the disease
on hold.

485
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:52,052
I love you all more than
anything in this world.

486
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:02,661
So, you think the doctors
were good?

487
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:08,801
Well, that's nothing compared
to the unconditional love

488
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:11,071
that you've all given me.

489
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:15,008
The painful sleepless nights,
Michael.

490
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,612
The daily phone calls.

491
00:35:22,015 --> 00:35:25,952
The lovely visits
and so much more.

492
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:28,921
I love you all to the moon
and back.

493
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:36,163
So, last month I decided
that it would be smart

494
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:40,000
to write a will,
and I did.

495
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:42,735
But then a couple of days ago
the doctors advised me

496
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:46,106
that it was now pointless.

497
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:47,740
Honey, come on,

498
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,708
what kind of doctor
would tell you that?

499
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:50,810
Who was he?

500
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,079
They all sat me down

501
00:35:52,112 --> 00:35:54,680
and they said that their
decision was unanimous.

502
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:55,848
Why?

503
00:35:57,384 --> 00:36:00,619
Because I'm officially
in remission.

504
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:03,990
What?

505
00:36:04,723 --> 00:36:06,859
Mum? Serious?

506
00:36:06,892 --> 00:36:08,594
Serious!

507
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:10,663
It's gone?

508
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:13,400
Well, I mean, there's a slim
chance of it coming back,

509
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:17,636
of course, but in all
practical senses, yes!

510
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,039
Mum, that's amazing.

511
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:27,013
- I love you, Mum.
- I love you.

512
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:29,950
You alright, Dad?

513
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:32,152
Of course I am,
you daft sod.

514
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:36,022
Why didn't you tell us
when you found out?

515
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:39,159
Because she wanted to
torture you, crybaby.

516
00:36:39,192 --> 00:36:41,161
- You're horrible.
- You deserved that one.

517
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:43,896
What's remission?

518
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:50,437
Hey, it means that your
mother's not ill anymore.

519
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,638
- You happy, bro?
- Yes!

520
00:36:57,877 --> 00:36:59,412
Perfect timing, Cass.

521
00:36:59,446 --> 00:37:02,149
I thought it would be a good
Christmas present.

522
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:05,018
Dad, shall we go back
to talking about

523
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:06,119
Lauren's love life again?

524
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:08,221
- You dare.
- I love you all.

525
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:09,389
Alright, hold on a minute.

526
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:11,391
Pipe down, you lot,
just for a moment.

527
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:14,094
I think this calls
for a toast.

528
00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:15,962
- Go on, Dad.
- Hear, hear!

529
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:20,766
To the most beautiful,
amazing, incredible wife.

530
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:21,867
And mum.

531
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:23,069
Yep,

532
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:27,207
and to the most incredible mum
to our beautiful children.

533
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,742
I give you Cassie Henderson!

534
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:31,044
To Mum!

535
00:37:41,454 --> 00:37:43,190
Oh, my God, Lucy!

536
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:46,326
Stop it! Stop it!

537
00:37:52,798 --> 00:37:54,301
No!

538
00:38:07,214 --> 00:38:08,949
Sit down!

539
00:38:20,193 --> 00:38:21,894
Very well.

540
00:38:46,953 --> 00:38:48,154
Eat.

541
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:05,332
We're all just products
of our own environments.

542
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,338
Betrayals, neglect.

543
00:40:14,307 --> 00:40:16,209
The things we've done,

544
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:21,081
the things done to us.

545
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:26,586
The burden of our elders'

546
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:29,922
insecurities forcefully
dressing us

547
00:40:29,956 --> 00:40:32,625
in life long misery jackets,

548
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,498
paying the price for
other people's mistakes.

549
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:45,939
But when you think about it,
Lauren,

550
00:40:45,972 --> 00:40:48,608
you are merely just a sponge

551
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:52,612
soaking up all
the self centered action

552
00:40:52,645 --> 00:40:58,184
of those who supposedly
love you so selflessly.

553
00:41:01,988 --> 00:41:03,957
Don't you want
to be set free?

554
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:48,701
Move!

555
00:42:39,486 --> 00:42:42,288
I don't care
what you do to me,

556
00:42:42,322 --> 00:42:45,091
but please just leave
my kids alone.

557
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:26,099
Come clean, Michael.

558
00:43:31,804 --> 00:43:33,106
Get some rest.

559
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,275
Dad!

560
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:37,410
Lucy, stop!
Don't hurt him!

561
00:43:37,443 --> 00:43:39,112
Nobody's getting hurt, hmm?

562
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:42,515
It's getting late.

563
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:44,517
People are tired.
I'm tired.

564
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:48,688
Let's all just calm down,
shall we?

565
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:52,191
There's no need to get
worked up over nothing.

566
00:43:55,695 --> 00:43:57,196
What?

567
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,398
What?

568
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:02,569
Please stop this.

569
00:44:04,304 --> 00:44:05,572
I'll do anything.

570
00:44:06,606 --> 00:44:11,277
Just let us go,
I'm begging you.

571
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,479
We never done
anything to you.

572
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:17,717
Lucy, please, no!

573
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,152
<i>Please!</i>

574
00:44:24,157 --> 00:44:25,558
<i>No!</i>

575
00:44:55,722 --> 00:44:57,457
Why'd you do that
to my mum?!

576
00:45:02,595 --> 00:45:04,864
She was already dead.

577
00:45:14,741 --> 00:45:16,142
Lie down.

578
00:45:33,326 --> 00:45:35,461
Oh, please, God.

579
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:38,431
Please.

580
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:41,868
Please, Jack.

581
00:46:29,649 --> 00:46:31,484
<i>Years ago,</i>

582
00:46:31,517 --> 00:46:36,289
<i>a father and his family
lived happily in a big,</i>

583
00:46:36,322 --> 00:46:38,257
bright house,

584
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,696
and one day
the father decided

585
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,632
to invite some guests
inside.

586
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:50,803
The guests willingly obliged.

587
00:46:52,072 --> 00:46:54,574
The father took them
under his wing,

588
00:46:54,607 --> 00:46:57,577
but this was short lived,
though.

589
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:03,416
Little did the guests know

590
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:07,754
that eventually the father
would deem them unwanted,

591
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,359
and so when the time came,

592
00:47:17,363 --> 00:47:23,436
the father took for himself
what was rightfully theirs,

593
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:26,839
and unfairly banished them,

594
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,312
leaving them to rot.

595
00:47:38,918 --> 00:47:42,022
So the guests waited

596
00:47:42,055 --> 00:47:48,494
and waited
and waited and waited,

597
00:47:48,528 --> 00:47:50,563
until one night

598
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:57,303
they found their way
back into the garden.

599
00:47:58,538 --> 00:48:02,542
But they had disguised
themselves.

600
00:48:05,045 --> 00:48:06,712
Do you see?

601
00:48:08,015 --> 00:48:09,950
Do you see?!

602
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:17,857
The father,
not knowing he had been tricked,

603
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,894
welcomed them back
into his home,

604
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:29,002
right under his
pretentious little nose.

605
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:40,446
Do you know how
this story ends, Ben?

606
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:51,992
They destroy
everything he loves.

607
00:48:54,161 --> 00:48:55,761
Who are you?

608
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:02,069
Demons come
as angels of light.

609
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:12,778
Don't do that.

610
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,996
- Come on.
- <i>Hello?</i>

611
00:51:10,629 --> 00:51:11,864
Matt.

612
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:18,305
I need you to get help
and come here.

613
00:51:18,338 --> 00:51:20,573
There's people in the house.

614
00:51:21,574 --> 00:51:23,776
<i>Lauren, you're scaring me.</i>

615
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:29,950
My parents' friends came over
for dinner tonight.

616
00:51:29,983 --> 00:51:31,751
<i>Yeah?</i>

617
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:35,588
We were having dinner
and...

618
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,859
they killed mum.

619
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:42,195
<i>What?</i>

620
00:51:42,929 --> 00:51:44,998
They killed her.

621
00:51:45,032 --> 00:51:48,168
She murdered her
right in front of us.

622
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:50,170
<i>Lauren,
what the hell is this?</i>

623
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:52,139
<i>You're not making any sense.</i>

624
00:51:52,172 --> 00:51:53,373
They didn't stop hitting.

625
00:51:53,407 --> 00:51:59,179
She had a hammer and she just
kept thumping mum's head...

626
00:52:03,616 --> 00:52:04,817
<i>Lauren?</i>

627
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,320
...until there was
nothing left.

628
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:16,595
My mum is dead.

629
00:52:16,629 --> 00:52:17,931
<i>Lauren, who did this?</i>

630
00:52:17,964 --> 00:52:19,899
My mum is dead.

631
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:21,334
<i>Lauren!</i>

632
00:52:23,303 --> 00:52:25,305
The neighbors.

633
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:27,673
<i>The neighbors?
What neighbors?</i>

634
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:32,179
Jack and Lucy.

635
00:52:32,212 --> 00:52:33,980
<i>Jack and Lucy?</i>

636
00:52:34,314 --> 00:52:35,581
<i>Why?</i>

637
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,651
I don't know.

638
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:41,955
Mum never did
anything wrong.

639
00:52:44,057 --> 00:52:46,393
Why would they do this?

640
00:52:46,426 --> 00:52:49,196
<i>Lauren,
just get out of the house.</i>

641
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:50,863
I can't.

642
00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:53,366
<i>Babe, whereabouts
are you right now?</i>

643
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,769
In my room,
on my bed.

644
00:52:59,872 --> 00:53:02,109
<i>Just get out now.</i>

645
00:53:02,142 --> 00:53:03,642
I can't.

646
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:05,744
<i>What do you mean you can't?
Just run!</i>

647
00:53:05,778 --> 00:53:08,747
They're still in the house,
they've got Ben.

648
00:53:08,781 --> 00:53:10,749
<i>Babe, call the police.</i>

649
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,852
I can't.
They've got Ben now,

650
00:53:12,885 --> 00:53:14,254
I need to go get him.

651
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:16,289
<i>No. You, you need
to call the police.</i>

652
00:53:16,323 --> 00:53:18,225
I need to go and get Ben.

653
00:53:18,258 --> 00:53:19,825
<i>Lauren,
don't make a sound.</i>

654
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:20,759
<i>Just hide.</i>

655
00:53:20,793 --> 00:53:22,661
<i>Stay as quiet as possible.</i>

656
00:53:23,863 --> 00:53:27,367
Matt, I need you to come
in here and help me.

657
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,369
<i>No, no, no, no.
Listen to me,</i>

658
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:31,171
<i>you need to stay still.</i>

659
00:53:31,204 --> 00:53:32,372
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

660
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:34,673
<i>Just stay quiet.</i>

661
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:39,246
<i>We've been watching you
for a long time.</i>

662
00:53:39,279 --> 00:53:41,047
Matt?

663
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:44,650
<i>But I think you should
go to sleep now...</i>

664
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:25,392
Lauren.

665
00:54:28,228 --> 00:54:29,728
<i>Lauren.</i>

666
00:54:30,964 --> 00:54:32,165
Eric?

667
00:54:58,391 --> 00:54:59,960
Lauren.

668
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:07,800
Eric?

669
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:52,145
Oh shit...

670
00:56:30,883 --> 00:56:32,152
Well, well, well.

671
00:56:33,553 --> 00:56:35,088
When I'm finished here,

672
00:56:38,224 --> 00:56:40,160
you're going to have to make
a choice, Lauren.

673
00:56:44,998 --> 00:56:47,567
They say that when you die,

674
00:56:49,202 --> 00:56:51,271
the ones that are affected

675
00:56:51,304 --> 00:56:53,440
are the ones
that you leave behind.

676
00:56:55,442 --> 00:56:58,244
So it all boils down to

677
00:56:58,278 --> 00:57:03,583
whether you want to put him
out of his misery.

678
00:57:05,452 --> 00:57:07,520
He won't know any better.

679
00:57:09,122 --> 00:57:10,523
Or don't.

680
00:57:11,558 --> 00:57:14,860
Save yourself
the lifelong guilt.

681
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,936
But one thing I will say,

682
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:26,339
if you don't,

683
00:57:26,373 --> 00:57:31,945
the consequences for him
will be far more severe.

684
00:57:37,117 --> 00:57:39,018
But why?

685
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:42,389
I just want to get
to know you.

686
00:57:46,493 --> 00:57:48,395
I just want
to get to know you.

687
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:59,272
You've so graciously
invited us over

688
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:05,979
and you've been such
wonderful hosts.

689
00:58:25,698 --> 00:58:27,267
I think we're all set.

690
00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:36,509
Please.

691
00:58:37,143 --> 00:58:38,311
Please.

692
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:41,080
Please, I'm sorry.

693
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:44,217
Eric. Eric!

694
00:58:47,187 --> 00:58:49,088
He's waking up.

695
00:58:49,756 --> 00:58:51,991
Lucy, please.
Please.

696
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:54,794
He's my brother.

697
00:58:58,665 --> 00:59:01,034
You'd better do it quickly.

698
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:04,637
Please.
Please, Lucy.

699
00:59:07,507 --> 00:59:09,275
Do it.

700
00:59:29,596 --> 00:59:31,598
Lauren?
What are you doing?

701
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,434
I'm so sorry.

702
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:36,436
Lauren, no.

703
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:38,171
They're gonna kill us.

704
00:59:39,205 --> 00:59:40,673
You're my sister.

705
00:59:41,508 --> 00:59:46,246
If I don't do this,
we'll both regret it.

706
00:59:49,849 --> 00:59:53,286
They're gonna do worse
things to you,

707
00:59:53,319 --> 00:59:56,422
and once they're done,
they'll do the same to me.

708
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:58,191
I don't care.

709
00:59:59,826 --> 01:00:01,628
Please don't do this.

710
01:00:03,596 --> 01:00:05,598
I can't have
my sister kill me.

711
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:09,068
I won't have
my sister kill me.

712
01:00:09,102 --> 01:00:10,703
You will.

713
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:12,639
You will care.

714
01:00:15,341 --> 01:00:16,809
Just put it down.

715
01:00:16,843 --> 01:00:18,511
I can't.

716
01:00:19,779 --> 01:00:22,749
Look what they did to mum.

717
01:00:22,782 --> 01:00:26,085
I can't watch them do
something worse to you.

718
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:30,290
Mum's dead.
I'm not.

719
01:00:30,323 --> 01:00:32,559
I'm sorry.

720
01:00:32,592 --> 01:00:36,162
They won't let me go,
they won't let us go!

721
01:00:39,465 --> 01:00:41,467
It's just you and me.

722
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:43,136
There's nobody here.

723
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,838
You've got a choice.

724
01:00:45,872 --> 01:00:48,308
You don't understand.

725
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:51,411
They're watching us.

726
01:00:52,645 --> 01:00:55,582
They've been watching us
this whole time.

727
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:59,419
If I don't do this,

728
01:00:59,452 --> 01:01:02,288
God knows
what they're gonna do next.

729
01:01:02,322 --> 01:01:04,123
They've gotten into
your head.

730
01:01:06,893 --> 01:01:08,795
Please don't do this.

731
01:01:10,663 --> 01:01:13,433
I always looked up to you
when we were kids.

732
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:16,736
- Don't.
- I still do.

733
01:01:18,438 --> 01:01:20,406
You have a funny way
of showing it.

734
01:01:22,475 --> 01:01:25,144
Listen, you need help.

735
01:01:26,947 --> 01:01:29,916
Please put down the gun,
Lauren.

736
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,451
I'd always run
into your room

737
01:01:31,484 --> 01:01:34,253
when mum and dad
used to fight,

738
01:01:34,287 --> 01:01:37,857
and every time,
you'd cheer me up.

739
01:01:38,491 --> 01:01:39,927
Stop.

740
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,861
You still cheer me up.

741
01:01:44,397 --> 01:01:45,698
I love you.

742
01:01:45,732 --> 01:01:47,800
Do you?

743
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:49,402
You're about to kill me.

744
01:01:49,435 --> 01:01:51,304
You don't understand.

745
01:01:51,337 --> 01:01:54,574
No, you don't understand
what I'm trying to say.

746
01:01:59,545 --> 01:02:01,581
Please don't kill me.

747
01:02:02,983 --> 01:02:04,751
I have no choice.

748
01:02:04,784 --> 01:02:06,753
We always have a choice.

749
01:02:09,622 --> 01:02:11,524
This is for the best.

750
01:02:13,593 --> 01:02:17,363
No, no.
Lauren please, no.

751
01:02:17,397 --> 01:02:18,698
Lauren.

752
01:02:18,731 --> 01:02:20,466
- I'm sorry.
- Lauren!

753
01:02:43,823 --> 01:02:45,926
They gave me no choice.

754
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:49,529
You had a choice.

755
01:02:49,562 --> 01:02:51,631
I'm so sorry.

756
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:55,468
Fuck you!

757
01:02:57,804 --> 01:03:00,440
I've been there for you
your entire life!

758
01:03:01,474 --> 01:03:03,242
You and Ben.

759
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:07,714
For all your
self-indulgent bullshit,

760
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:13,319
even when you were wrong,

761
01:03:13,352 --> 01:03:15,755
I was always there!

762
01:03:15,788 --> 01:03:17,991
I'm so sorry.

763
01:03:18,025 --> 01:03:20,460
I can't.

764
01:03:22,795 --> 01:03:24,664
I'll never forgive you.

765
01:03:28,936 --> 01:03:31,370
I had no choice.
I had no choice.

766
01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:33,806
I forgive you.

767
01:03:34,807 --> 01:03:35,708
Stop!

768
01:03:35,742 --> 01:03:38,611
What have I done?
I didn't do anything!

769
01:03:38,644 --> 01:03:41,581
Leave him alone!
I'm so sorry, Eric.

770
01:03:41,614 --> 01:03:44,383
I'm so sorry, Eric.

771
01:03:45,953 --> 01:03:47,854
I'm so sorry.
I'm so...

772
01:03:54,527 --> 01:03:57,430
Leave my kids alone,
you fucking animals!

773
01:03:57,931 --> 01:03:59,699
<i>Leave them alone!
Please!</i>

774
01:03:59,732 --> 01:04:00,633
Dad!

775
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:03,636
<i>Open this door.
Open this fucking door!</i>

776
01:04:03,669 --> 01:04:06,739
<i>Please, please, open this.</i>

777
01:04:09,342 --> 01:04:10,576
<i>Dad.</i>

778
01:04:11,878 --> 01:04:13,346
Dad.

779
01:04:17,517 --> 01:04:19,619
This is all my fault, son.

780
01:04:20,853 --> 01:04:22,822
Jack is my son,

781
01:04:26,692 --> 01:04:28,561
and I never told him,

782
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:33,833
and I bought this
on all of us.

783
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:37,070
What do you mean,
he's your son?

784
01:04:37,104 --> 01:04:39,739
It was a long time ago,

785
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:43,010
before I met your mother.

786
01:04:45,444 --> 01:04:47,413
I was a coward.

787
01:04:48,048 --> 01:04:51,551
I panicked and I left them.

788
01:04:55,721 --> 01:04:57,657
I left them.

789
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:01,460
And then I met your mother.

790
01:05:07,533 --> 01:05:10,603
She made me a stronger man.

791
01:05:12,672 --> 01:05:16,043
And I tried to go back,
I tried to fix it.

792
01:05:19,012 --> 01:05:24,717
But I didn't know
how to tell him

793
01:05:26,485 --> 01:05:27,787
or you

794
01:05:28,821 --> 01:05:31,024
and I'm sorry.

795
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:34,094
I'm sorry.

796
01:05:42,668 --> 01:05:43,903
Lauren!

797
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,974
<i>Eric!</i>

798
01:05:49,775 --> 01:05:51,044
Lauren!

799
01:05:51,577 --> 01:05:52,778
Eric!

800
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,714
Eric!

801
01:05:54,747 --> 01:05:58,885
No! No! No!

802
01:05:58,918 --> 01:06:00,553
- <i>Lauren!</i>
- No!

803
01:06:06,093 --> 01:06:07,426
Open this door!

804
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,062
Open this fucking door!

805
01:06:10,931 --> 01:06:12,665
<i>Open this door!</i>

806
01:06:35,956 --> 01:06:37,523
Leave him alone!

807
01:06:43,163 --> 01:06:45,564
Eric, I'm so sorry.

808
01:06:58,577 --> 01:06:59,745
<i>Eric?</i>

809
01:09:30,263 --> 01:09:31,630
Lauren?

810
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:38,431
Son?

811
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,767
What did they do to you?

812
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,869
They took my eyes.

813
01:10:47,374 --> 01:10:48,807
They what?

814
01:10:50,776 --> 01:10:52,445
Jesus Christ!

815
01:11:04,124 --> 01:11:05,824
We've got
to get out of here!

816
01:11:05,858 --> 01:11:07,327
We've got to get out!

817
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:09,963
Where's your brother?

818
01:11:09,996 --> 01:11:11,730
Where's your sister?

819
01:11:11,764 --> 01:11:13,133
The garage.

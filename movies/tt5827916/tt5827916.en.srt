3
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:32,341
<i>I thought that we could
build our nest high up...</i>

4
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:34,977
<i>in the trees.</i>

5
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:40,448
<i>Fly away, like birds...</i>

6
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:44,420
<i>to the mountains.</i>

7
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:39,127
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

8
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,096
Oh, we have
so many already.

9
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:42,657
Remember
the day when we first met?

10
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:46,161
You were shy like now.

11
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:49,798
I remember.

12
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,035
<i>That motorcycle.</i>

13
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,305
<i>My best dress.</i>

14
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,249
<i>You looked at me...</i>

15
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:11,621
<i>and I knew.</i>

16
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:22,632
<i>How simple life was then.</i>

17
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:31,173
<i>It seemed no trouble
could reach our valley.</i>

18
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:38,347
<i>We lived above the clouds.</i>

19
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:56,264
<i>My sister
came to live with us.</i>

20
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,833
He likes you.

21
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,422
<i>We had our home.</i>

22
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:26,094
<i>Your mother,</i>

23
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,065
<i>our family,</i>

24
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,739
<i>our village,</i>

25
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:41,142
<i>Radegund.</i>

26
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,556
Ah!

27
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,043
<i>Dear Fani,</i>

28
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,014
<i>warm greetings to you
from your Franz in training.</i>

29
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,350
<i>This week,</i>

30
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:36,584
<i>I have things easy.</i>

31
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:40,788
<i>In the mornings,
riding on a motorcycle.</i>

32
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:43,758
<i>For me,
it's entertaining.</i>

33
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:45,194
Hello, mountains!

34
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,199
<i>I would love
to hear your singing again.</i>

35
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,600
Hello, sun!

36
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:55,436
<i>I'm looking forward
to our reunion.</i>

37
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,680
<i>I met a fellow here.</i>

38
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,714
<i>His name is Waldland.</i>

39
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,584
- How are you doing this?
- Well...

40
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,885
In two months of training...

41
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:12,086
<i>No pretense about him.</i>

42
00:11:12,253 --> 00:11:14,556
<i>I wish that
I could be a little mouse</i>

43
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:15,624
<i>In the cornfield</i>

44
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:16,825
<i>Always smiling.</i>

45
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:19,427
<i>And I
would be out there in the...</i>

46
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:21,229
<i>Sometimes I wish</i>

47
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:24,865
<i>I could be a little bird...</i>

48
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:16,218
<i>My dear husband,</i>

49
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:21,322
<i>they say that
France has surrendered.</i>

50
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:26,762
<i>They're
sending farmers home...</i>

51
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:30,699
<i>for now at least.</i>

52
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,039
<i>Is it true?</i>

53
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,347
<i>Sister's lonely.</i>

54
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,120
<i>I wish
she had someone like you.</i>

55
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,293
<i>We could use you here.</i>

56
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:01,196
<i>To break in the calf.</i>

57
00:13:09,904 --> 00:13:11,506
<i>The harvest comes nearer.</i>

58
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,812
<i>We burned the bad weeds.</i>

59
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:40,302
<i>I got some piglets
from Mossbauer.</i>

60
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:43,739
<i>Four weeks old.</i>

61
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,085
<i>With warm greetings
to you...</i>

62
00:13:58,186 --> 00:13:59,655
<i>Your loving wife,</i>

63
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,459
<i>Fani.</i>

64
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:04,785
<i>Oh, my wife,</i>

65
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:12,660
<i>what's happened to our country?</i>

66
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:19,168
<i>To the land we love?</i>

67
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,034
Where are the kids?

68
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:34,469
Inside.

69
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:13,041
Oh,
Papa's coming for you!

70
00:20:06,954 --> 00:20:08,088
<i>What is it?</i>

71
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:15,864
I've just been called up.

72
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:23,572
We thought there would be peace,

73
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,575
but this war goes on.

74
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:30,946
- I don't know why.
- Shh.

75
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:34,482
Do you believe
in what we're fighting for?

76
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:38,854
Not really.

77
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,124
<i>He did what he had to.</i>

78
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,293
<i>He was not content
to watch his nation go under.</i>

79
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,697
Before he came, it all was
in a state of collapse.

80
00:21:57,298 --> 00:21:58,599
A Babylon!

81
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:03,203
We worshipped foreign gods.

82
00:22:04,071 --> 00:22:05,004
You're drunk.

83
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:06,941
No!

84
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:11,245
And I am not your friend.
I am your Mayor!

85
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:13,114
And now they tell us

86
00:22:14,347 --> 00:22:16,651
to spare these other races.

87
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:19,487
Degraded.

88
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:24,159
So contemptible they can no
longer despise themselves!

89
00:22:28,528 --> 00:22:30,798
They sow the earth with salt.

90
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:38,306
Instead of a world,
there is a department store.

91
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:41,442
Foreigners swarm
over our streets.

92
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:42,776
Immigrants who don't care

93
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:45,846
for the past,
only for what they can grab.

94
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,250
This is what happens
when a world...

95
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:51,185
when a world dies.

96
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:53,288
Men survive.

97
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:56,323
But their life is gone.

98
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:57,759
Their life is gone.

99
00:22:57,825 --> 00:22:59,361
Their reason for living.

100
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:21,816
<i>The mask is off.</i>

101
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,886
I fear for my family.

102
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:32,027
Mother's old.

103
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:34,796
Yeah.

104
00:23:37,565 --> 00:23:39,433
I hope she dies soon.

105
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:45,974
Don't they know evil
when they see it?

106
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:01,321
<i>We're used to it now.</i>

107
00:24:04,392 --> 00:24:05,460
<i>Crime.</i>

108
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:09,497
<i>No shame.</i>

109
00:24:16,203 --> 00:24:17,271
<i>Be careful.</i>

110
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,011
Father, if they call me up,
I can't serve.

111
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,813
We're killing innocent people.

112
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:09,317
Raiding other countries.

113
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:10,617
Preying on the weak.

114
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:14,120
Now the priests call
them heroes, even saints.

115
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:16,157
The soldiers that do this.

116
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:20,528
It might be that
the other ones are the heroes.

117
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:24,865
The ones who defend their
homes against the invaders.

118
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:26,300
Have you spoken
with anyone else?

119
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:28,635
- Your wife?
- No.

120
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:29,837
Family?

121
00:26:34,741 --> 00:26:35,776
Don't you think

122
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,912
you ought to consider
the consequences

123
00:26:38,011 --> 00:26:39,614
of your actions?

124
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,249
For them?

125
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:54,028
You'd almost surely be shot.

126
00:26:57,332 --> 00:26:59,167
Yes.

127
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:02,269
Your sacrifice

128
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:04,439
would benefit no one.

129
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:17,251
I'll speak with the Bishop,
about your case.

130
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,825
A wiser man than I.

131
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,059
Thank you.

132
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,095
Thank you.

133
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:54,455
These last weeks,
you're different.

134
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:01,395
What is it?

135
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:15,275
Morning.

136
00:28:17,244 --> 00:28:19,513
We are collecting
for the war effort.

137
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,581
Hmm. I see.

138
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,452
I'm sorry, I...

139
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:33,560
Look, as I said,
I don't have anything to give.

140
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:35,395
I'm...

141
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:40,468
Please...

142
00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:42,302
No.

143
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:52,246
I wish you all a good day.

144
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:28,014
<i>You have refused to
contribute</i>

145
00:29:28,115 --> 00:29:30,585
to our collection
on behalf of the veterans?

146
00:29:32,452 --> 00:29:33,421
Their families?

147
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,210
I also hear
that you have refused

148
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:58,278
to accept the family allowance,

149
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:02,383
and other subsidies the state
would have provided you.

150
00:30:03,984 --> 00:30:05,118
Why?

151
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,555
Franz. Tell me.

152
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:21,568
Show a little humor.

153
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:24,771
Yes.

154
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:30,510
Nobody refused but you.

155
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,355
Please.

156
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:44,691
Thank you.

157
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:43,651
<i>We must be strong.</i>

158
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,387
<i>Stand firm.</i>

159
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:55,630
<i>Learn the lesson
of the blacksmith.</i>

160
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,203
<i>No matter how hard
the hammer strikes...</i>

161
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:07,942
the anvil cannot,

162
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:11,778
need not, strike back.

163
00:32:16,182 --> 00:32:18,719
<i>The anvil outlives the hammer.</i>

164
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,627
<i>That which is hammered
on the anvil,</i>

165
00:32:27,694 --> 00:32:28,828
<i>takes its form,</i>

166
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:32,633
<i>not only from the hammer,
but the anvil, too.</i>

167
00:32:46,078 --> 00:32:47,248
Have a seat.

168
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,225
Your excellency.

169
00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:02,730
Thank you so much
for speaking with me.

170
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:08,803
If God gives us free will,

171
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:12,706
we're responsible
for what we do...

172
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:15,543
what we fail to do...

173
00:33:16,576 --> 00:33:17,577
aren't we?

174
00:33:19,814 --> 00:33:20,915
If our leaders

175
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:23,516
are not good...

176
00:33:25,152 --> 00:33:26,487
if they're evil...

177
00:33:28,188 --> 00:33:29,457
What does one do?

178
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,894
I want to save my life,

179
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:36,697
but not through lies.

180
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:47,340
You have a duty
to the Fatherland.

181
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,051
The church tells you so.

182
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,362
<i>Do you know the words</i>

183
00:34:10,496 --> 00:34:12,032
<i>of the apostle?</i>

184
00:34:18,204 --> 00:34:21,041
<i>Let every man be subject</i>

185
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:24,411
<i>"to the powers placed over him.'</i>

186
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:34,688
<i>Do you hear those bells?</i>

187
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,693
<i>They're melting them.</i>

188
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,362
For bullets.

189
00:34:48,235 --> 00:34:49,637
I think he was afraid

190
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:51,338
that I might be a spy.

191
00:34:54,574 --> 00:34:56,443
They don't dare
to commit themselves,

192
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,512
or it could be their turn next.

193
00:35:22,635 --> 00:35:25,605
<i>We can't blame
the Bishop for going along.</i>

194
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,043
He hoped, by doing it,

195
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:34,782
that the regime would be more
tolerant towards the Church.

196
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,554
But now, the priests are sent

197
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,756
to concentration camps.

198
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:46,760
Church processions banned.

199
00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:50,764
<i>We don't have a say.</i>

200
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,668
<i>What can we do?</i>

201
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:58,105
<i>We,</i>

202
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,475
<i>little people here.</i>

203
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:26,567
Give me
a piece of coal.

204
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,469
- Coal?
- Just one.

205
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:31,204
- Just one?
- Yeah.

206
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:32,973
Thank you.

207
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:50,891
I paint the tombs
of the prophets.

208
00:36:55,762 --> 00:36:59,467
I help people look up
from those pews and dream.

209
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:05,605
They look up and...

210
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:08,842
they imagine that if they
lived back in Christ's time,

211
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:10,811
they wouldn't have done
what the others did.

212
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:16,015
They would have murdered
those whom they now adore.

213
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:25,659
I paint all this suffering,
but I don't suffer myself.

214
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:28,094
I make a living of it.

215
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,271
What we do

216
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:39,806
is just create

217
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:42,675
sympathy.

218
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:44,744
We create...

219
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:47,780
We create admirers.

220
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:52,185
We don't create followers.

221
00:37:57,423 --> 00:37:59,726
Christ's life is a demand.

222
00:38:03,463 --> 00:38:05,231
You don't want
to be reminded of it.

223
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,637
So we don't have to see
what happens to the truth.

224
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,875
A darker time is coming...

225
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:19,612
when men will be more clever.

226
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:23,651
<i>They won't fight the truth.</i>

227
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:26,887
<i>They'll just ignore it.</i>

228
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:38,699
<i>I paint
their comfortable Christ,</i>

229
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:42,136
<i>with a halo over his head.</i>

230
00:38:45,472 --> 00:38:46,840
<i>How can I show</i>

231
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:49,276
<i>what I haven't lived?</i>

232
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,981
Someday I might have
the courage to venture.

233
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:57,183
Not yet.

234
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,759
<i>Someday I'll...</i>

235
00:39:06,793 --> 00:39:08,862
<i>I'll paint the true Christ.</i>

236
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,048
<i>They won't call you up.</i>

237
00:40:05,617 --> 00:40:07,221
They need farmers.

238
00:40:10,623 --> 00:40:12,692
How else are people
going to eat?

239
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:27,407
Maybe the war will end soon.

240
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:08,715
- Is she asleep?
- Yeah.

241
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:26,933
Why are you
looking at me that way?

242
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:32,873
It's an act of madness.

243
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:35,775
A sin...

244
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,311
A sin against his family,
against his village.

245
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:31,030
We're different, Mother.

246
00:42:36,168 --> 00:42:37,503
I'm sorry.

247
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:45,179
But I am grateful to you
for wishing me the best.

248
00:42:54,387 --> 00:42:57,124
<i>Your life was
hard enough already.</i>

249
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,285
His mother
looks at me coldly,

250
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:27,153
like I was to blame.

251
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:34,127
I want what you want.

252
00:43:34,927 --> 00:43:38,365
But I can't bear
that he makes you suffer.

253
00:43:42,568 --> 00:43:44,438
He makes a choice for you, too.

254
00:43:48,206 --> 00:43:49,942
Does he know what he's doing?

255
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:53,547
Tell him.

256
00:43:56,548 --> 00:43:57,583
Pride.

257
00:43:57,884 --> 00:43:59,152
It's pride.

258
00:43:59,885 --> 00:44:01,255
That's what it is.

259
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,534
<i>Did they say
something to you?</i>

260
00:44:16,902 --> 00:44:19,105
I saw them speaking
to you by the road.

261
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:34,487
They said...

262
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:40,693
...their husbands
have gone off to war.

263
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:44,664
Why should they fight to...

264
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:47,634
save us?

265
00:44:56,643 --> 00:44:57,711
Did they hurt you...

266
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,149
with their words?

267
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:11,524
I don't care.

268
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:45,652
All good?

269
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:47,687
Yeah.

270
00:47:11,978 --> 00:47:13,480
You were a wild one.

271
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:16,615
You fought with the police.

272
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:19,418
You know, you remember.

273
00:47:20,686 --> 00:47:22,221
Who changed you?

274
00:47:25,023 --> 00:47:26,159
Your wife?

275
00:47:28,961 --> 00:47:30,664
I have sympathy with you.

276
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:35,367
I don't want anything bad.

277
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:37,103
I know.

278
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,372
So...

279
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,875
Help me.

280
00:47:42,608 --> 00:47:43,876
Radegund loves you.

281
00:47:49,815 --> 00:47:50,817
You...

282
00:47:53,152 --> 00:47:54,753
You are a child of Radegund.

283
00:47:59,257 --> 00:48:01,227
<i>I am not your enemy.</i>

284
00:48:03,163 --> 00:48:04,262
I'm your friend.

285
00:48:04,362 --> 00:48:06,365
- Yeah?
- Yes, I am.

286
00:48:09,467 --> 00:48:12,437
You still belong to our people.

287
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:14,574
You cannot say no

288
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:16,808
<i>to your race.</i>

289
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:18,378
<i>And your blood.</i>

290
00:48:19,878 --> 00:48:21,181
<i>And your village.</i>

291
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,882
And your home.

292
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:25,851
We have to defend our land!

293
00:48:26,652 --> 00:48:28,921
Till he came,
the people were in despair.

294
00:48:28,987 --> 00:48:31,157
Humiliated. In chains.

295
00:48:32,324 --> 00:48:34,860
Who do you think
they will make responsible?

296
00:48:35,494 --> 00:48:36,395
It's me.

297
00:48:37,396 --> 00:48:39,900
Who do you think
they will interrogate?

298
00:48:40,766 --> 00:48:42,101
You'll be hanged!

299
00:48:42,668 --> 00:48:45,003
Do you understand
what that means?

300
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:46,739
They'll hang you!

301
00:48:47,072 --> 00:48:49,275
Your family, your wife,
your children,

302
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:51,277
will have no one
to support them.

303
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:53,780
Your mother will die unconsoled!

304
00:49:01,554 --> 00:49:02,556
Calm down.

305
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,259
Don't touch me.

306
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:08,061
Don't touch me.

307
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:13,398
You're worse.

308
00:49:13,766 --> 00:49:15,869
You're worse than them!

309
00:49:16,268 --> 00:49:19,238
Because they are enemies,

310
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:22,741
but you are a traitor!

311
00:49:32,851 --> 00:49:34,386
I've been there, to Vienna.

312
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:37,791
I saw what happened there.

313
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:40,492
<i>Lost.</i>

314
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,295
They kicked her
in her face. Bleeding.

315
00:49:42,394 --> 00:49:44,597
<i>Torn from the tent
in which we trusted.</i>

316
00:49:44,864 --> 00:49:47,434
<i>Killing the insane. Children.</i>

317
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,235
<i>Brought to
the King of Terrors.</i>

318
00:49:49,335 --> 00:49:50,936
<i>We saw the hate in their eyes.</i>

319
00:49:57,242 --> 00:49:59,811
<i>We've forgotten our
true Fatherland.</i>

320
00:50:36,581 --> 00:50:38,484
<i>What would
your father say?</i>

321
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:45,659
<i>What do you think?</i>

322
00:50:47,226 --> 00:50:49,329
- He fought.
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:50:51,364 --> 00:50:52,965
- He died.
- Yes.

324
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:56,369
And what do you think
what for he died?

325
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:59,038
In the trenches, in the mud?

326
00:51:05,144 --> 00:51:06,413
Think about it.

327
00:51:12,918 --> 00:51:13,886
Yeah.

328
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,702
I had a dream.

329
00:51:33,072 --> 00:51:34,139
I saw a train.

330
00:51:38,277 --> 00:51:41,046
<i>The locomotive
was powerful and dark, and...</i>

331
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,451
<i>it drew the children.</i>

332
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:49,521
<i>And you couldn't see
where it was going, just...</i>

333
00:51:51,123 --> 00:51:53,959
the fields and trees
flashing by.

334
00:52:17,483 --> 00:52:19,052
<i>I hold to a memory.</i>

335
00:52:24,422 --> 00:52:25,724
<i>Of what I knew once.</i>

336
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,974
<i>I find no one to turn to.</i>

337
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,182
<i>Nothing enters my soul.</i>

338
00:54:56,175 --> 00:54:58,611
When have our prayers
not been answered?

339
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:13,927
If we're faithful to him,
he'll be faithful to us.

340
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,076
I believe it.

341
00:55:37,182 --> 00:55:38,351
<i>We have him.</i>

342
00:55:43,655 --> 00:55:44,824
<i>That's enough.</i>

343
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,882
The whole world is sinking.

344
00:56:20,425 --> 00:56:21,960
There's no answer.

345
00:56:27,065 --> 00:56:28,300
To follow him...

346
00:56:29,434 --> 00:56:30,969
is insanity.

347
00:56:43,514 --> 00:56:45,717
What are you going to do, Franz?

348
00:56:49,688 --> 00:56:52,590
They ask you to take an oath

349
00:56:52,657 --> 00:56:55,193
to the Antichrist.

350
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,829
I know, I know.

351
00:56:57,362 --> 00:56:59,331
It's a life without honor.

352
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:04,703
Is this here,

353
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,172
the end of the world?

354
00:57:10,675 --> 00:57:12,277
Is this the death

355
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:14,247
of the light?

356
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:32,097
<i>We are like a breath.</i>

357
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:42,007
<i>Like a shadow
that passes away.</i>

358
00:57:43,442 --> 00:57:44,710
Madness!

359
00:58:39,498 --> 00:58:40,833
<i>I've been called up.</i>

360
00:58:47,005 --> 00:58:48,541
<i>You could hide
in the woods.</i>

361
00:58:55,648 --> 00:58:57,048
We'll run away!

362
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,317
To the mountains!

363
00:59:27,246 --> 00:59:28,914
<i>Does a man have the right to let</i>

364
00:59:29,014 --> 00:59:31,150
<i>himself be put to death?</i>

365
00:59:34,253 --> 00:59:35,388
For the truth?

366
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:40,960
Could it possibly please God?

367
00:59:41,827 --> 00:59:43,930
<i>He wants us to have peace.</i>

368
00:59:45,931 --> 00:59:47,300
<i>Happiness.</i>

369
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,971
<i>Not to bring suffering
on ourselves.</i>

370
01:00:03,215 --> 01:00:05,351
<i>We have to
stand up to evil.</i>

371
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:17,997
You're going to do it,
aren't you?

372
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:23,155
<i>Her happiness
is in your hands.</i>

373
01:02:25,222 --> 01:02:26,726
She could have had other men.

374
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:37,702
We have enough troubles
in our lives.

375
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:55,387
You want too little
for yourself, Fani.

376
01:03:06,864 --> 01:03:08,533
Why don't you oppose him, Fani?

377
01:03:09,601 --> 01:03:10,568
Hmm?

378
01:03:10,936 --> 01:03:12,038
Resist him.

379
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,510
You don't know
what unhappiness is!

380
01:03:21,713 --> 01:03:23,249
Your man never left you.

381
01:03:40,431 --> 01:03:42,367
Oh, okay.

382
01:04:13,965 --> 01:04:15,835
You can't change the world.

383
01:04:29,981 --> 01:04:31,583
The world's stronger.

384
01:04:37,556 --> 01:04:38,657
I need you.

385
01:05:31,476 --> 01:05:33,244
<i>You could work
in a hospital.</i>

386
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:36,715
There's nothing wrong with that.

387
01:05:45,757 --> 01:05:46,692
Is there?

388
01:06:18,889 --> 01:06:20,425
You want to have more?

389
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,029
<i>My dear son.</i>

390
01:07:41,773 --> 01:07:42,875
<i>You're all I have.</i>

391
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:53,018
<i>You know what it is like
to grow up without a father.</i>

392
01:07:59,456 --> 01:08:01,793
<i>I know what it's like
to be alone.</i>

393
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,150
<i>Girls, your...</i>

394
01:08:25,283 --> 01:08:28,120
<i>Your father is going away.</i>

395
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:33,692
On a journey.

396
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:36,661
<i>On a long journey.</i>

397
01:08:37,328 --> 01:08:39,364
<i>He'll be gone for a while.</i>

398
01:13:19,711 --> 01:13:21,146
<i>My dear wife.</i>

399
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:28,987
<i>I know you fear for me,</i>

400
01:13:30,721 --> 01:13:32,657
<i>but my burden is light.</i>

401
01:13:37,728 --> 01:13:39,462
<i>When I compare my suffering</i>

402
01:13:39,529 --> 01:13:41,032
<i>to that of other people,</i>

403
01:13:42,966 --> 01:13:45,636
<i>I see that mine
is the smallest of crosses.</i>

404
01:13:50,908 --> 01:13:53,377
<i>It is horrible
what they have suffered.</i>

405
01:14:02,487 --> 01:14:04,021
<i>You have to remember</i>

406
01:14:04,488 --> 01:14:06,190
<i>what you knew in a better hour.</i>

407
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:30,347
<i>Spring has come.</i>

408
01:14:33,618 --> 01:14:35,553
<i>My three little girls
will already be</i>

409
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:37,823
<i>running barefoot,
picking flowers.</i>

410
01:14:43,094 --> 01:14:44,729
<i>It would be better to tell them</i>

411
01:14:44,796 --> 01:14:47,332
<i>where their father is
than to tell them stories.</i>

412
01:14:56,274 --> 01:14:59,111
<i>The fresh green of the grass
is good for a person.</i>

413
01:15:02,113 --> 01:15:04,783
<i>Someone with freedom
might not notice it.</i>

414
01:15:23,033 --> 01:15:25,168
<i>Greetings to Mother,
to you,</i>

415
01:15:25,502 --> 01:15:26,938
<i>the girls and all.</i>

416
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,076
<i>See you again.</i>

417
01:15:47,824 --> 01:15:49,126
<i>Dear husband.</i>

418
01:15:54,733 --> 01:15:56,034
<i>Greetings in God,</i>

419
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,303
<i>who will make
everything right again.</i>

420
01:16:02,172 --> 01:16:04,408
<i>Greetings from your
three little women.</i>

421
01:16:09,814 --> 01:16:11,115
<i>They say to tell you only</i>

422
01:16:11,181 --> 01:16:13,184
<i>about the good things
they're doing.</i>

423
01:16:13,385 --> 01:16:14,519
<i>Of course.</i>

424
01:16:15,886 --> 01:16:16,953
<i>But I wouldn't surprise you</i>

425
01:16:17,054 --> 01:16:19,257
<i>by telling you
about their disobedience.</i>

426
01:16:23,595 --> 01:16:24,829
Ow!

427
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,105
<i>I have to scold the girls.</i>

428
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:40,145
<i>They're always
demanding my attention.</i>

429
01:16:52,222 --> 01:16:55,060
<i>Rosi's always asking about you.</i>

430
01:16:56,127 --> 01:16:57,896
<i>When we are going to bed,</i>

431
01:16:58,628 --> 01:16:59,631
<i>she says,</i>

432
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:02,133
<i>"Leave the door unlocked</i>

433
01:17:02,867 --> 01:17:04,536
<i>so Papa can come in."</i>

434
01:17:09,407 --> 01:17:10,475
<i>At meals,</i>

435
01:17:11,641 --> 01:17:13,510
<i>"Save some for Papa."</i>

436
01:17:21,953 --> 01:17:23,655
<i>She sang a song for you.</i>

437
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,563
<i>Wondered if you could hear.</i>

438
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:39,537
<i>Rosi wanted to take your picture
to bed with her tonight.</i>

439
01:17:43,373 --> 01:17:45,644
<i>You were supposed
to sleep beside her.</i>

440
01:17:49,713 --> 01:17:52,650
<i>I told her that when Father
comes home, he will.</i>

441
01:17:56,988 --> 01:17:58,456
Good night.

442
01:18:13,904 --> 01:18:16,174
<i>Warm greetings
from your loving wife,</i>

443
01:18:20,944 --> 01:18:22,146
<i>Fani.</i>

444
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:40,597
You may leave us alone.

445
01:18:42,632 --> 01:18:43,635
Have a seat.

446
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:00,018
What good do you think
your defiance is doing anyone?

447
01:19:04,354 --> 01:19:06,724
You think it will change
the course of things?

448
01:19:14,198 --> 01:19:16,334
You think the authorities
are aware of you?

449
01:19:17,167 --> 01:19:19,436
That your protests
will come to their attention?

450
01:19:25,042 --> 01:19:27,746
Do you think anyone
will know of it? Ever hear?

451
01:19:30,381 --> 01:19:33,618
No one knows what goes on
behind these walls. No one.

452
01:19:36,953 --> 01:19:38,555
What purpose does it serve?

453
01:19:48,265 --> 01:19:49,366
Does it make no difference

454
01:19:49,434 --> 01:19:51,735
if this war is just or unjust?

455
01:20:00,211 --> 01:20:02,079
<i>You shine their shoes.</i>

456
01:20:10,354 --> 01:20:12,322
<i>You fill their sandbags.</i>

457
01:20:17,561 --> 01:20:18,695
<i>Are you innocent?</i>

458
01:20:55,899 --> 01:20:56,835
<i>What is it?</i>

459
01:20:57,768 --> 01:20:58,770
<i>Pride?</i>

460
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:03,708
<i>Are you better than the rest?</i>

461
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:07,378
<i>Are you alone wise?</i>

462
01:21:12,884 --> 01:21:14,586
How do you know
what is good or bad?

463
01:21:24,395 --> 01:21:25,730
You know better than I?

464
01:21:31,769 --> 01:21:33,338
Did heaven tell you this?

465
01:21:35,206 --> 01:21:36,608
Heard a voice?

466
01:21:44,914 --> 01:21:46,050
<i>There's a difference,</i>

467
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:48,652
<i>between the kind of suffering
we can't avoid</i>

468
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:50,654
<i>and the suffering we choose.</i>

469
01:22:13,711 --> 01:22:15,847
<i>You've forgotten
what the world looks like.</i>

470
01:22:19,884 --> 01:22:20,885
<i>The light.</i>

471
01:22:22,252 --> 01:22:23,554
<i>The sky.</i>

472
01:22:37,234 --> 01:22:39,470
<i>I didn't make this world
the way it is.</i>

473
01:22:41,405 --> 01:22:42,873
And neither did you.

474
01:22:48,612 --> 01:22:50,815
We all have blood on our hands.

475
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:54,319
No one is innocent.

476
01:22:55,252 --> 01:22:57,222
Crime, bloodshed everywhere.

477
01:23:03,828 --> 01:23:05,630
He who created this world...

478
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:08,666
he created evil.

479
01:23:16,807 --> 01:23:20,377
<i>Conscience makes cowards
of us all.</i>

480
01:23:28,819 --> 01:23:30,421
<i>Take care, my friend.</i>

481
01:23:33,157 --> 01:23:34,958
<i>The Antichrist is clever.</i>

482
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:40,498
<i>He uses a man's virtues...</i>

483
01:23:42,432 --> 01:23:43,833
<i>to mislead him.</i>

484
01:24:41,057 --> 01:24:42,193
<i>Dearest wife...</i>

485
01:24:46,096 --> 01:24:49,065
<i>I leave for Berlin
at 10:13 A.M.</i>

486
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:54,838
<i>Have no concerns about me.</i>

487
01:24:57,307 --> 01:24:58,676
<i>Pray for me.</i>

488
01:27:18,314 --> 01:27:19,549
Look down.

489
01:27:24,954 --> 01:27:25,890
Down.

490
01:27:32,962 --> 01:27:33,864
Up.

491
01:28:30,587 --> 01:28:31,956
<i>Dear husband...</i>

492
01:28:36,926 --> 01:28:39,596
<i>Your letter of May 7th
has arrived.</i>

493
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:41,798
<i>Many thanks.</i>

494
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,252
<i>The well went dry on Thursday.</i>

495
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:08,759
<i>We need a good rain.</i>

496
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:41,891
<i>What I feared has come.</i>

497
01:29:44,996 --> 01:29:47,698
<i>I have found no one
to assist with the work,</i>

498
01:29:48,231 --> 01:29:49,399
<i>except for Resie.</i>

499
01:30:09,185 --> 01:30:11,988
<i>Strohofer stole beets
from our field.</i>

500
01:30:20,296 --> 01:30:23,067
<i>I hear nothing
but your voice.</i>

501
01:30:37,814 --> 01:30:39,283
<i>I visited the widow.</i>

502
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:41,719
<i>Maria.</i>

503
01:30:45,389 --> 01:30:48,292
<i>She hadn't spoken with anyone
in two weeks.</i>

504
01:30:58,001 --> 01:31:00,404
<i>The new hay gives me hope.</i>

505
01:31:03,506 --> 01:31:04,840
<i>The scent in the barn.</i>

506
01:31:08,712 --> 01:31:09,980
<i>The wind.</i>

507
01:31:13,817 --> 01:31:15,219
<i>The wheat.</i>

508
01:31:18,521 --> 01:31:19,789
<i>The sky.</i>

509
01:31:41,779 --> 01:31:44,248
<i>He won't send us more
than we can bear.</i>

510
01:32:59,189 --> 01:33:00,990
Excuse me, can you tell me...

511
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,635
<i>The Colonel
must be consulted.</i>

512
01:33:45,702 --> 01:33:48,005
May I meet with him?

513
01:33:52,109 --> 01:33:53,477
A busy man.

514
01:33:55,078 --> 01:33:57,448
But phone, make an appointment.

515
01:33:59,917 --> 01:34:00,918
I've tried to,

516
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:03,019
but my call isn't answered.

517
01:34:03,087 --> 01:34:04,622
That surprises me.

518
01:34:08,257 --> 01:34:10,527
The problem must be
on your side.

519
01:34:11,293 --> 01:34:13,663
The telephone works
quite well up here.

520
01:34:22,739 --> 01:34:23,773
Then...

521
01:34:24,106 --> 01:34:25,943
how can I make an appointment?

522
01:34:27,844 --> 01:34:29,579
You don't answer my letters.

523
01:34:32,715 --> 01:34:34,016
<i>It took me two days to get here.</i>

524
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:35,985
<i>It's a very difficult journey.</i>

525
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:49,759
<i>Most beloved wife...</i>

526
01:35:52,261 --> 01:35:55,331
<i>Once again, warm greetings
from your loving husband.</i>

527
01:36:11,081 --> 01:36:12,716
<i>I'll write a few words,</i>

528
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:15,085
<i>just as they come from my heart.</i>

529
01:36:18,521 --> 01:36:21,224
<i>Even though I am writing them
with bound hands,</i>

530
01:36:21,757 --> 01:36:24,594
<i>it's still better than
if my will were bound.</i>

531
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:45,681
<i>These men...</i>

532
01:36:46,983 --> 01:36:48,485
<i>have no friends.</i>

533
01:36:52,755 --> 01:36:55,292
<i>No loving hand to hold theirs.</i>

534
01:36:57,359 --> 01:36:58,795
What are you here for?

535
01:37:00,063 --> 01:37:01,265
Treason.

536
01:37:02,431 --> 01:37:04,233
<i>They've seen sorrow.</i>

537
01:37:06,002 --> 01:37:07,171
<i>Shame.</i>

538
01:37:09,105 --> 01:37:10,474
<i>Destruction.</i>

539
01:37:18,347 --> 01:37:20,250
<i>What strong hearts.</i>

540
01:37:54,184 --> 01:37:55,452
<i>When you give up the idea</i>

541
01:37:55,518 --> 01:37:57,721
<i>of surviving at any price...</i>

542
01:38:01,957 --> 01:38:04,260
<i>a new light floods in.</i>

543
01:38:09,198 --> 01:38:11,167
<i>Once you were in a rush...</i>

544
01:38:12,268 --> 01:38:14,337
<i>always short of time.</i>

545
01:38:19,176 --> 01:38:20,878
<i>Now you have all you need.</i>

546
01:38:29,351 --> 01:38:31,721
<i>Once you never
forgave anyone...</i>

547
01:38:34,123 --> 01:38:35,992
<i>judged people without mercy.</i>

548
01:38:40,496 --> 01:38:43,199
<i>Now you see
your own weakness...</i>

549
01:38:44,734 --> 01:38:47,570
<i>so you can understand
the weakness of others.</i>

550
01:42:35,131 --> 01:42:36,132
Do you think...

551
01:42:39,935 --> 01:42:41,137
I did this?

552
01:42:46,141 --> 01:42:47,810
He used to be different.

553
01:42:51,581 --> 01:42:53,750
He changed when he met you.

554
01:43:24,212 --> 01:43:25,547
<i>My dear children...</i>

555
01:43:28,984 --> 01:43:33,288
<i>I thought of you especially,
Corpus Christi Sunday.</i>

556
01:43:44,199 --> 01:43:45,402
<i>The bells ringing</i>

557
01:43:45,668 --> 01:43:47,135
<i>over the fields.</i>

558
01:43:50,006 --> 01:43:51,775
<i>I would have loved
to have seen you</i>

559
01:43:51,841 --> 01:43:53,710
<i>with your crowns of flowers.</i>

560
01:43:59,381 --> 01:44:01,251
<i>Your devoted father greets you,</i>

561
01:44:03,153 --> 01:44:04,588
<i>from far away.</i>

562
01:44:54,235 --> 01:44:55,570
<i>Dear husband...</i>

563
01:44:58,341 --> 01:45:00,944
<i>Loving greetings to you
on this Sunday.</i>

564
01:45:04,579 --> 01:45:06,283
<i>We're all concerned about you.</i>

565
01:45:10,153 --> 01:45:11,087
<i>Hopefully,</i>

566
01:45:11,186 --> 01:45:13,088
<i>things are not going poorly.</i>

567
01:45:16,893 --> 01:45:18,761
<i>The girls send greetings.</i>

568
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:26,201
<i>Loisi says they will give you
kisses together.</i>

569
01:45:32,574 --> 01:45:34,711
<i>I'm always with you in thought.</i>

570
01:45:59,935 --> 01:46:01,738
<i>I can go to Salzburg.</i>

571
01:46:12,581 --> 01:46:14,483
<i>Papa offered to come with me.</i>

572
01:46:25,561 --> 01:46:27,730
<i>Fear overcomes me.</i>

573
01:46:30,432 --> 01:46:32,100
<i>I know it should not.</i>

574
01:46:36,872 --> 01:46:39,709
<i>Trust in the triumph
of the good.</i>

575
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:48,217
<i>No evil can happen
to a good man.</i>

576
01:46:55,024 --> 01:46:57,127
<i>Not a sparrow falls to Earth,</i>

577
01:46:58,359 --> 01:46:59,528
<i>but he knows it.</i>

578
01:47:29,425 --> 01:47:30,793
I'm sorry.

579
01:47:39,268 --> 01:47:40,737
A father...

580
01:47:41,237 --> 01:47:42,771
loves his child.

581
01:47:46,408 --> 01:47:47,476
A father

582
01:47:48,476 --> 01:47:50,345
wants his child to be happy.

583
01:47:51,613 --> 01:47:53,482
For life not to touch her.

584
01:47:58,488 --> 01:47:59,756
And you...

585
01:48:05,327 --> 01:48:06,896
such a good child.

586
01:48:10,432 --> 01:48:11,801
Franz, too.

587
01:48:18,006 --> 01:48:21,009
Better to suffer injustice
than to do it.

588
01:49:22,872 --> 01:49:24,707
<i>I've been appointed
by the court</i>

589
01:49:24,773 --> 01:49:26,409
<i>to be your defense attorney.</i>

590
01:49:28,845 --> 01:49:30,546
As I understand,
your resistance is

591
01:49:30,613 --> 01:49:33,016
specifically to serving
in combat.

592
01:49:34,182 --> 01:49:36,920
But I believe if you were
to accept medical service,

593
01:49:37,554 --> 01:49:39,154
you would work

594
01:49:40,189 --> 01:49:42,958
as an orderly in a hospital,
that sort of thing.

595
01:49:43,893 --> 01:49:46,496
They would probably
drop these charges.

596
01:49:53,569 --> 01:49:56,339
Will I be required
to swear loyalty to Hitler?

597
01:49:56,572 --> 01:49:57,273
Oh, words!

598
01:49:57,773 --> 01:50:00,009
I mean, no one takes that
sort of thing seriously. Hmm?

599
01:50:02,545 --> 01:50:03,512
I can't.

600
01:50:09,885 --> 01:50:12,088
You are a stubborn man.

601
01:50:15,358 --> 01:50:19,362
See here, I am going to
leave this paper with you.

602
01:50:19,429 --> 01:50:20,864
Keep it with you.

603
01:50:21,229 --> 01:50:22,130
Sign,

604
01:50:22,965 --> 01:50:24,367
and you will go free.

605
01:50:26,368 --> 01:50:27,536
But I am free.

606
01:50:32,341 --> 01:50:34,443
So... why am I here?

607
01:50:39,381 --> 01:50:40,449
I don't know.

608
01:50:49,391 --> 01:50:50,393
<i>You...</i>

609
01:50:51,694 --> 01:50:52,996
<i>my shepherd.</i>

610
01:51:03,538 --> 01:51:06,541
<i>You make me lie down
in green pastures.</i>

611
01:51:13,548 --> 01:51:15,350
<i>By the river of life.</i>

612
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:30,132
<i>You...</i>

613
01:51:32,868 --> 01:51:34,237
<i>my strength.</i>

614
01:51:38,807 --> 01:51:40,510
<i>You show me the path.</i>

615
01:51:47,582 --> 01:51:48,650
<i>You...</i>

616
01:51:51,953 --> 01:51:53,389
<i>our light.</i>

617
01:51:58,627 --> 01:52:01,264
<i>Darkness is not dark to you.</i>

618
01:52:07,836 --> 01:52:10,039
<i>Bring us to your eternal light.</i>

619
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:16,012
<i>To you.</i>

620
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:20,550
<i>The true.</i>

621
01:52:25,154 --> 01:52:27,156
<i>The never-failing light.</i>

622
01:52:41,671 --> 01:52:43,271
You call me your brother.

623
01:52:56,685 --> 01:52:57,687
<i>Father.</i>

624
01:53:02,492 --> 01:53:04,193
<i>To you I cry.</i>

625
01:53:10,432 --> 01:53:11,501
<i>My rock.</i>

626
01:53:15,570 --> 01:53:16,738
<i>My fortress.</i>

627
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:21,777
I can do as I like with you.

628
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:24,979
Nobody would know.
Nobody would care.

629
01:53:25,046 --> 01:53:27,416
Nobody'd lift a hand
to stop me.

630
01:53:35,992 --> 01:53:36,992
<i>Who sees us?</i>

631
01:53:47,903 --> 01:53:49,505
<i>Give me strength.</i>

632
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,245
<i>To follow you.</i>

633
01:54:03,118 --> 01:54:04,353
<i>Spirit...</i>

634
01:54:13,061 --> 01:54:14,329
<i>Lead me.</i>

635
01:54:18,067 --> 01:54:19,335
<i>Show me.</i>

636
01:55:01,543 --> 01:55:02,545
<i>Lord...</i>

637
01:55:15,289 --> 01:55:16,893
<i>You do nothing.</i>

638
01:55:58,434 --> 01:55:59,835
<i>Where are you?</i>

639
01:56:12,314 --> 01:56:14,615
<i>Why did you create us?</i>

640
01:57:09,304 --> 01:57:10,472
<i>Have the persecuted</i>

641
01:57:10,538 --> 01:57:12,841
<i>received the kingdom
of heaven?</i>

642
01:57:22,451 --> 01:57:24,654
<i>The meek inherited
the earth?</i>

643
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:33,429
The wise deceive us.

644
01:57:34,061 --> 01:57:35,530
Afraid.

645
01:57:35,997 --> 01:57:37,365
Oh...

646
01:57:38,533 --> 01:57:40,635
I was once like you.

647
01:57:46,375 --> 01:57:47,643
Confess it.

648
01:57:50,479 --> 01:57:52,548
<i>Your God has no pity.</i>

649
01:57:53,882 --> 01:57:56,717
He left us. Abandoned us.

650
01:57:57,018 --> 01:57:58,621
Like he did your Christ.

651
01:57:58,987 --> 01:58:00,056
His son!

652
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:12,734
How far we are
from having our daily bread.

653
01:58:15,369 --> 01:58:17,305
How far from being delivered

654
01:58:17,372 --> 01:58:18,641
from evil!

655
01:58:29,984 --> 01:58:34,455
<i>If we could only see
the beginning of his kingdom.</i>

656
01:58:37,492 --> 01:58:38,860
<i>The dawn!</i>

657
01:58:41,296 --> 01:58:43,132
<i>But...</i>

658
01:58:46,068 --> 01:58:47,136
<i>Nothing.</i>

659
01:58:50,338 --> 01:58:51,707
<i>Nothing ever!</i>

660
01:58:55,644 --> 01:58:57,980
Why give your life for them?

661
01:59:09,091 --> 01:59:10,993
<i>Your man died in vain.</i>

662
01:59:14,162 --> 01:59:15,162
<i>He came.</i>

663
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:17,632
<i>And it was all for nothing.</i>

664
01:59:51,734 --> 01:59:54,637
<i>We had 20 centuries
of failure.</i>

665
01:59:55,804 --> 01:59:58,173
<i>We need a successful saint.</i>

666
02:01:01,237 --> 02:01:02,171
Oh, yeah.

667
02:01:04,172 --> 02:01:05,640
No one will help us,

668
02:01:06,641 --> 02:01:08,543
well, we do it on our own.

669
02:01:10,345 --> 02:01:11,547
Sister?

670
02:01:15,484 --> 02:01:16,852
Yes.

671
02:01:46,747 --> 02:01:48,650
Come on.

672
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:01,262
Okay.

673
02:02:01,997 --> 02:02:02,965
Yeah.

674
02:03:23,211 --> 02:03:24,313
<i>Dear wife,</i>

675
02:03:28,182 --> 02:03:31,787
<i>I still can't say
how my future will unfold.</i>

676
02:03:35,791 --> 02:03:38,327
<i>What comes next is
seldom better.</i>

677
02:03:40,728 --> 02:03:43,731
<i>And still,
now begins the month of June.</i>

678
02:03:45,701 --> 02:03:47,336
<i>The most beautiful month.</i>

679
02:03:51,506 --> 02:03:53,475
<i>Nature does not notice
the sorrow</i>

680
02:03:53,542 --> 02:03:55,244
<i>that has come over the people.</i>

681
02:03:58,046 --> 02:03:59,747
<i>Though I cannot see much here,</i>

682
02:03:59,814 --> 02:04:01,483
<i>I imagine that everything</i>

683
02:04:01,682 --> 02:04:04,987
<i>is a more lovely green
than in past years.</i>

684
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:18,899
<i>At dawn,</i>

685
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:23,238
<i>we can hear blackbirds singing
loudly outside our windows.</i>

686
02:04:28,042 --> 02:04:29,845
<i>They seem to have more freedom</i>

687
02:04:30,444 --> 02:04:33,113
<i>and to know more of
peace and happiness,</i>

688
02:04:33,747 --> 02:04:36,384
<i>though they are
only unreasoning animals</i>

689
02:04:37,286 --> 02:04:38,886
<i>than we humans do.</i>

690
02:04:40,087 --> 02:04:43,192
<i>We, who have the gift
of understanding.</i>

691
02:05:02,577 --> 02:05:04,746
You gave me back more
than I gave you.

692
02:05:26,934 --> 02:05:28,470
<i>I found a fellow here</i>

693
02:05:30,572 --> 02:05:32,106
<i>from my training days.</i>

694
02:05:33,341 --> 02:05:34,243
Franz?

695
02:05:36,211 --> 02:05:37,179
Franz!

696
02:05:37,878 --> 02:05:39,081
Look at you.

697
02:05:41,783 --> 02:05:43,718
What have you done?
You're a criminal!

698
02:05:44,018 --> 02:05:46,654
<i>He lifts the spirits
of the other fellows.</i>

699
02:05:47,087 --> 02:05:48,523
We're getting on just fine.

700
02:05:49,957 --> 02:05:52,259
Good, bad, together.

701
02:05:52,894 --> 02:05:55,030
<i>He asks about our family.</i>

702
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:56,798
Don't you worry.

703
02:05:57,466 --> 02:05:58,600
Trouble lasts a day.

704
02:05:58,667 --> 02:06:00,001
Yeah, eat. Eat. Eat.

705
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:02,036
- Is that all you have?
- Yeah.

706
02:06:10,078 --> 02:06:12,214
<i>Have you heard
of the Scharfrichter?</i>

707
02:06:14,849 --> 02:06:16,552
The one who chops off your head?

708
02:06:22,523 --> 02:06:24,192
He's a very well-dressed man.

709
02:06:24,391 --> 02:06:25,993
He comes and he has a...

710
02:06:27,229 --> 02:06:28,262
a big hat.

711
02:06:28,896 --> 02:06:30,565
He is a man of good taste.

712
02:06:31,932 --> 02:06:34,469
He cuts your head,
but it's a clean cut,

713
02:06:34,668 --> 02:06:36,537
and before
you can think a thought,

714
02:06:36,805 --> 02:06:38,273
just...

715
02:07:07,569 --> 02:07:09,037
<i>I wonder how it feels.</i>

716
02:07:10,438 --> 02:07:14,076
Maybe your body's old,
your head is young,

717
02:07:14,141 --> 02:07:16,177
and you see
your head flying away.

718
02:07:16,712 --> 02:07:18,079
And your old arms...

719
02:07:18,412 --> 02:07:19,646
they reach up

720
02:07:19,948 --> 02:07:21,250
to the head.

721
02:07:22,516 --> 02:07:24,318
And they're still in chains.

722
02:07:26,554 --> 02:07:29,157
And you take this young head...

723
02:07:31,893 --> 02:07:35,163
and you put it back
on your body.

724
02:07:36,898 --> 02:07:38,600
And you open your eyes...

725
02:07:40,667 --> 02:07:42,470
and the chains are gone!

726
02:07:46,507 --> 02:07:47,576
<i>But what happens then?</i>

727
02:07:53,582 --> 02:07:55,182
<i>Maybe you'll see the moon.</i>

728
02:07:58,552 --> 02:07:59,688
<i>Or the stars.</i>

729
02:08:14,601 --> 02:08:16,438
You know, even if it rains,

730
02:08:17,072 --> 02:08:18,539
the sun is shining.

731
02:08:22,476 --> 02:08:23,377
<i>The sun</i>

732
02:08:23,712 --> 02:08:25,213
<i>shines on good</i>

733
02:08:25,646 --> 02:08:26,648
<i>and evil</i>

734
02:08:26,914 --> 02:08:28,050
<i>the same.</i>

735
02:08:46,234 --> 02:08:47,702
There are more chains

736
02:08:47,769 --> 02:08:49,171
than mad dogs.

737
02:09:44,359 --> 02:09:46,294
<i>I wish I'd had a wife.</i>

738
02:09:47,994 --> 02:09:49,363
And a farm.

739
02:09:52,233 --> 02:09:53,802
<i>And apple trees.</i>

740
02:09:54,802 --> 02:09:56,203
<i>And a cherry tree.</i>

741
02:09:57,037 --> 02:09:58,239
And...

742
02:09:59,239 --> 02:10:00,841
maybe some grapes.

743
02:10:01,376 --> 02:10:03,177
We could do our own wine.

744
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:06,181
White wine.

745
02:10:06,381 --> 02:10:10,218
And red wine.
One red wine for the winter.

746
02:10:10,917 --> 02:10:13,788
And white wine for the summer.

747
02:10:15,055 --> 02:10:16,690
We would not drink too much.

748
02:10:17,591 --> 02:10:19,626
We would pray. And work.

749
02:10:19,694 --> 02:10:20,395
But sometimes...

750
02:10:20,494 --> 02:10:22,463
Sometimes, a little drink
is good.

751
02:10:24,731 --> 02:10:25,734
Sometimes...

752
02:10:27,234 --> 02:10:28,804
we would go to church.

753
02:10:30,104 --> 02:10:32,340
And sometimes not. Sometimes...

754
02:10:33,073 --> 02:10:34,542
we'd stay at home.

755
02:10:37,211 --> 02:10:38,747
<i>And we'd make music.</i>

756
02:13:05,426 --> 02:13:07,328
Do you have anything to say

757
02:13:07,395 --> 02:13:08,930
in your defense?

758
02:13:39,327 --> 02:13:41,429
We'll have
a short recess.

759
02:13:58,112 --> 02:13:59,480
Come in.

760
02:14:07,421 --> 02:14:08,789
Please, uh...

761
02:14:21,368 --> 02:14:22,737
Sit down.

762
02:14:23,237 --> 02:14:24,471
Thank you.

763
02:14:28,975 --> 02:14:31,478
Do you imagine
that anything you do

764
02:14:31,545 --> 02:14:34,582
will change
the course of this war?

765
02:14:36,149 --> 02:14:40,621
That anyone outside this court
will ever hear of you?

766
02:14:43,557 --> 02:14:45,627
No one will be changed.

767
02:14:47,661 --> 02:14:49,963
The world will go on as before.

768
02:15:01,609 --> 02:15:04,311
Your actions may even
have the opposite effect

769
02:15:04,377 --> 02:15:05,846
of what you intend.

770
02:15:08,515 --> 02:15:11,618
Someone else
will take your place.

771
02:15:23,264 --> 02:15:25,567
Do you judge me?

772
02:15:30,837 --> 02:15:31,872
I don't judge you.

773
02:15:35,877 --> 02:15:36,944
I'm not saying,

774
02:15:37,078 --> 02:15:38,246
"He's wicked.

775
02:15:38,479 --> 02:15:39,680
I am right."

776
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:43,752
I don't know everything.

777
02:15:52,359 --> 02:15:53,460
A man...

778
02:15:54,929 --> 02:15:56,029
may do wrong.

779
02:15:59,399 --> 02:16:00,501
And...

780
02:16:02,103 --> 02:16:03,637
he can't get out of it.

781
02:16:05,006 --> 02:16:06,641
To make his life clear.

782
02:16:10,877 --> 02:16:14,181
Maybe... he'd like to go back
but he can't.

783
02:16:17,118 --> 02:16:18,119
But...

784
02:16:22,256 --> 02:16:24,792
I have this feeling
inside me...

785
02:16:28,996 --> 02:16:30,465
...that I can't do

786
02:16:31,265 --> 02:16:32,766
what I believe is wrong.

787
02:16:46,613 --> 02:16:48,850
Do you have
a right to do this?

788
02:16:51,386 --> 02:16:53,154
Do I have a right not to?

789
02:17:47,975 --> 02:17:50,979
The judgment
of this court is...

790
02:17:52,379 --> 02:17:53,581
death.

791
02:18:21,041 --> 02:18:23,844
<i>So today
they pronounced the sentence.</i>

792
02:18:28,082 --> 02:18:29,317
<i>But they still</i>

793
02:18:30,117 --> 02:18:31,753
<i>have to confirm it.</i>

794
02:18:35,456 --> 02:18:37,023
<i>Sign the paper in your cell.</i>

795
02:18:37,091 --> 02:18:39,193
<i>You'll go free.
I can work it out.</i>

796
02:20:51,859 --> 02:20:53,694
It's from his lawyer!

797
02:21:09,675 --> 02:21:11,712
They've
condemned him to death.

798
02:21:15,983 --> 02:21:17,818
I have to go to Berlin.

799
02:21:20,922 --> 02:21:22,156
I'll come with you.

800
02:23:56,442 --> 02:23:57,611
Franz!

801
02:24:55,034 --> 02:24:57,237
You're doing no one any good.

802
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:01,608
No one.

803
02:25:05,545 --> 02:25:08,481
This could be the last
opportunity to abandon this...

804
02:25:11,652 --> 02:25:13,387
senseless position.

805
02:25:14,788 --> 02:25:16,090
If you do...

806
02:25:16,389 --> 02:25:17,156
<i>Franz.</i>

807
02:25:17,424 --> 02:25:19,193
...I will at once
petition the court

808
02:25:19,259 --> 02:25:21,194
to stay the execution
of your sentence,

809
02:25:21,261 --> 02:25:23,064
but it must be done
without delay.

810
02:25:23,797 --> 02:25:25,166
Do you understand?

811
02:25:26,834 --> 02:25:27,969
Now.

812
02:25:31,470 --> 02:25:34,341
I'm sticking
my neck out here.

813
02:25:34,406 --> 02:25:35,709
This could jeopardize
my career...

814
02:25:37,144 --> 02:25:38,512
my personal safety.

815
02:25:41,448 --> 02:25:44,518
The charges would be dropped,
I'm sure, if you just...

816
02:25:45,519 --> 02:25:47,121
change your stand.

817
02:25:47,688 --> 02:25:48,722
I beg you to.

818
02:25:50,657 --> 02:25:52,626
The war may soon be over.

819
02:25:53,793 --> 02:25:55,029
You might...

820
02:25:56,362 --> 02:25:58,565
You might never
have to face a situation

821
02:25:58,699 --> 02:26:01,369
that would call on you
to do what you oppose.

822
02:26:02,903 --> 02:26:04,271
<i>My love.</i>

823
02:26:07,207 --> 02:26:08,376
Franz.

824
02:26:10,943 --> 02:26:12,479
Don't you see what's coming?

825
02:26:19,185 --> 02:26:20,654
There's not much time!

826
02:26:22,656 --> 02:26:25,693
God doesn't care what you say,
only what's in your heart.

827
02:26:28,495 --> 02:26:30,698
Say the oath
and think what you like.

828
02:26:48,048 --> 02:26:49,417
Do you understand?

829
02:27:14,875 --> 02:27:16,243
I love you.

830
02:27:21,881 --> 02:27:23,283
Whatever you do.

831
02:27:26,653 --> 02:27:27,720
Whatever...

832
02:27:28,621 --> 02:27:29,522
comes.

833
02:27:35,829 --> 02:27:37,230
I'm with you.

834
02:27:41,868 --> 02:27:42,870
Always.

835
02:27:59,986 --> 02:28:01,522
Do what is right.

836
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:26,647
No! Let me go!

837
02:29:40,987 --> 02:29:42,322
<i>You said,</i>

838
02:29:42,689 --> 02:29:43,623
<i>"Knock.</i>

839
02:29:45,225 --> 02:29:46,926
<i>It will be opened.</i>

840
02:29:49,695 --> 02:29:50,763
<i>Ask.</i>

841
02:29:53,166 --> 02:29:54,533
<i>It will be given."</i>

842
02:32:59,318 --> 02:33:00,987
<i>You've always been good to me.</i>

843
02:33:02,823 --> 02:33:03,957
And to my son.

844
02:33:04,790 --> 02:33:05,759
And I've...

845
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:16,670
Forgive me!

846
02:34:21,266 --> 02:34:22,269
<i>You.</i>

847
02:34:25,704 --> 02:34:27,875
<i>You love him more than I do.</i>

848
02:34:37,550 --> 02:34:39,085
<i>Give him courage.</i>

849
02:34:41,587 --> 02:34:42,788
<i>Wisdom.</i>

850
02:34:46,525 --> 02:34:47,727
<i>Strength.</i>

851
02:35:09,481 --> 02:35:10,751
<i>Father...</i>

852
02:35:24,230 --> 02:35:26,032
<i>Tomorrow it will be done.</i>

853
02:35:44,450 --> 02:35:45,818
<i>Thank you, Father.</i>

854
02:36:34,867 --> 02:36:36,935
<i>Now, my dear children...</i>

855
02:36:37,670 --> 02:36:40,040
<i>When mother
reads this letter to you,</i>

856
02:36:41,540 --> 02:36:43,242
<i>your father will be dead.</i>

857
02:36:47,112 --> 02:36:50,016
<i>Through God's grace
we'll soon meet again.</i>

858
02:37:03,229 --> 02:37:05,198
<i>Dearest wife and mother...</i>

859
02:37:06,766 --> 02:37:10,302
<i>It was not possible for me
to free you from the sorrows</i>

860
02:37:10,369 --> 02:37:11,837
<i>that you've endured for me.</i>

861
02:37:18,378 --> 02:37:19,346
<i>And now,</i>

862
02:37:20,147 --> 02:37:21,547
<i>oh, my dear ones,</i>

863
02:37:22,147 --> 02:37:25,249
<i>don't forget me
in your prayers.</i>

864
02:37:26,652 --> 02:37:28,254
<i>I pray for you.</i>

865
02:37:29,189 --> 02:37:30,356
<i>From the other side.</i>

866
02:38:58,611 --> 02:38:59,879
What do I write?

867
02:39:48,427 --> 02:39:49,962
Shh.

868
02:41:10,442 --> 02:41:11,377
<i>Franz.</i>

869
02:41:25,358 --> 02:41:26,359
<i>Franz.</i>

870
02:46:03,002 --> 02:46:04,404
A time will come
when we will know

871
02:46:04,469 --> 02:46:06,206
what all this is for.

872
02:46:19,385 --> 02:46:21,621
<i>And there will be no mysteries.
We will know...</i>

873
02:46:23,988 --> 02:46:24,990
<i>why...</i>

874
02:46:28,628 --> 02:46:29,695
<i>we live.</i>

875
02:46:40,806 --> 02:46:42,375
<i>We'll come together.</i>

876
02:46:48,013 --> 02:46:49,682
<i>We'll plant orchards.</i>

877
02:46:53,051 --> 02:46:54,319
<i>Fields.</i>

878
02:46:59,057 --> 02:47:01,594
<i>We'll build the land back up.</i>

879
02:47:30,121 --> 02:47:31,390
<i>Franz.</i>

880
02:47:41,800 --> 02:47:43,335
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

881
02:47:50,075 --> 02:47:51,643
<i>In the mountains.</i>

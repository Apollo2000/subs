3
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:47,415
He had a black cat
named Machek when he was a boy.

4
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:54,477
The cat followed him everywhere.

5
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:00,969
And one day, when he
stroked the cat's back,

6
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:03,346
he saw a miracle.

7
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:08,359
A sheet of light
crackling under his hand.

8
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:11,893
"Lightning in the sky,"

9
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:13,629
his father explained,

10
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:15,865
"is the same thing
as the spark shooting

11
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,568
"from Machek's back."

12
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:19,912
And Tesla asked himself,

13
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:25,448
"Is nature a gigantic cat?

14
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,461
"And if so,

15
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,723
"who strokes its back?"

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,287
Mind over matter,

17
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:56,329
that's what it's
all about, isn't it?

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,827
Eventually, we'll be
able to see in the dark.

19
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,542
I found them.

20
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:06,550
I think there are more
in the crazy drawer.

21
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,561
Do you know where that is?

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,356
The crazy drawer?

23
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:15,493
That means is you
don't have crazy drawers

24
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,197
where you're from?

25
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,051
My mother had a crazy drawer.

26
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:19,822
And yours?

27
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,595
Leave my mother out of this.

28
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:25,118
No one expected you
to come in tonight, Tom.

29
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:26,725
Ha, no?

30
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,060
Seriously?

31
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:30,220
Well I expected it.

32
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,723
When I was five years old...

33
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:40,469
Ed, you don't have to
stop because I'm talking.

34
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:47,663
I was five years old and
we sailed across Lake Erie

35
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,555
to visit the Edison
clan there in Vienna.

36
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:52,946
Vienna, Ontario.

37
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:57,750
Mother and father, sisters,
Marriane and Tanney,

38
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,805
my brother, Charlie,
and my Grandpa Sam.

39
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,006
I learned to swim.

40
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,077
When I got back to Ohio,

41
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,853
I went exploring with
my good friend, George.

42
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:10,605
George Lockwood.

43
00:03:10,662 --> 00:03:12,497
He was exactly my age.

44
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:14,515
We went out to the
canal below my house

45
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,730
and I went into the water
and George followed me

46
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:20,459
and afterward, I went
home feeling very subdued

47
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:21,962
and crawled into bed.

48
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:26,565
When my mother woke
me, it was very dark

49
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:28,829
and she asked about George.

50
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,673
Everybody was looking
for him, half the town.

51
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:36,909
Had lit lanterns, called
his name looking everywhere.

52
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:41,683
I told her I saw George's
head disappear in the water

53
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,564
and I waited for him a long time

54
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:46,605
and I didn't know what to do.

55
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:50,663
I was five years old.

56
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:55,598
What made me think
of that just now.

57
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:56,825
Go home, Tom.

58
00:03:56,897 --> 00:03:57,731
Seriously.

59
00:03:58,623 --> 00:04:00,577
I aways assumed
people can swim.

60
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:05,483
Oh, Tesla, didn't
see you there before.

61
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,893
It is true you're
from Transylvania?

62
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,006
No.

63
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,717
Have you ever
eaten human flesh?

64
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:23,968
Are you married?

65
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:28,403
No.

66
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:31,372
Why do you ask?

67
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,172
We like to give
the new men a hard time.

68
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:39,668
I can swim.

69
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:41,049
What's that?

70
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,172
What you said before,

71
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:46,588
I can swim.

72
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:47,669
Can you?

73
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:48,536
Well good.

74
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:51,116
We'll see.

75
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:10,887
Pity the
poor immigrant,

76
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:12,227
as the song goes.

77
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:16,367
Tesla came to America
with an open heart

78
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:19,933
filled with
expectation and hope.

79
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,944
I told you about my brother.

80
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,346
It was this time of year.

81
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:50,610
I was seven,

82
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:52,525
he was 12.

83
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,537
He didn't die instantly
when he was thrown

84
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,807
from the horse.

85
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,316
My mother woke me,

86
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,563
brought me to the body,

87
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:03,373
told me to kiss him on the lips.

88
00:06:04,132 --> 00:06:06,263
His very cold lips.

89
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:11,966
He was the brilliant one.

90
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:15,931
I could never measure up.

91
00:06:33,372 --> 00:06:34,793
Dear Szigeti,

92
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,434
I'm finding my way at
Edison's Machine Works,

93
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:44,293
where there's always too much
to do and not enough time,

94
00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:46,394
never enough money or men,

95
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:51,404
constant fixes,
upgrades, emergencies.

96
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:56,176
Edison hardly sleeps and
expects everyone around him

97
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,703
to sleep even less.

98
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:04,009
He talks to everyone, but
is incapable of listening.

99
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:07,555
He has no interest in my motor.

100
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:12,935
You know the proverb, nothing
grows in the shadow of an Oak.

101
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:24,157
I had hoped that
Edison and I would,

102
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,178
I don't know, work together,

103
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:30,800
that he would understand.

104
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,093
Yes.

105
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,259
That we could be friends.

106
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:40,808
Edison doesn't have
time to comb his hair.

107
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,521
It's more than that.

108
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,518
There was a death in the family.

109
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:49,138
Nobody talks about it.

110
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:50,174
His wife,

111
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,423
his wife died.

112
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,381
When was this?

113
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:57,507
Tuesday.

114
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:04,665
Alternating current
is a waste of time.

115
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:08,324
Impractical and deadly.

116
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:11,280
There's no future in it.

117
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,749
$50,000.

118
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:26,100
You think I owe you
$50,000 honestly?

119
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:28,103
Tesla,

120
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:31,589
you don't understand the
American sense of humor.

121
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,645
This is pretty surely
not how it happened

122
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:45,303
but what can I tell you?

123
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,641
If you Google Nikola Tesla
you get 34 million results,

124
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:51,552
but for images there
are mostly just

125
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,519
three our four photographs
repeated over and over.

126
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,962
They get flipped around.

127
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,900
Some are colorized or
photoshopped with lightning

128
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:02,387
in the background but it's
basically just four pictures.

129
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,360
Beyond that, things get
murky and more imaginative.

130
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:14,593
He was born in 1856,
far from the Gilded Age

131
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:17,330
in Likas Milian, a
small rural village

132
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:19,264
in what's now Croatia.

133
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:21,805
His father is an
Orthodox Serbian priest,

134
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:25,157
but he's closer with his
mother, a brilliant woman

135
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:27,126
who couldn't read or write.

136
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:30,631
He's a precocious boy, a
bit withdrawn, secretive

137
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:32,953
with a gift for languages
and mathematics.

138
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:35,839
Defying his father, he
studies engineering in Prague,

139
00:09:35,898 --> 00:09:37,063
but never graduates.

140
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:39,898
In Budapest, coming
out of a depression,

141
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:43,796
walking in a park with a
friend, he sees in a flash,

142
00:09:43,877 --> 00:09:45,825
in a vision the
motor that will be

143
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,969
his first revolutionary
invention.

144
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:53,160
Alternating current
is a waste of time.

145
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:55,418
Impractical and deadly.

146
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,606
There's no future in it.

147
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,793
$50,000.

148
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:06,346
You think I owe you $50,000?

149
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:09,730
Tesla, you have no understanding

150
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:11,575
of the American sense of humor.

151
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:22,844
A man who says he
doesn't care about money

152
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:26,006
can find himself tormented
by the lack of it.

153
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,754
Whereas Edison,
Edison values money

154
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,538
but spends it faster
than he makes it.

155
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:34,905
But he's always making it

156
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:36,643
in great quantities.

157
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:41,258
Google Thomas Edison and you
get over 64 million results.

158
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,001
Twice as many as Tesla.

159
00:10:44,756 --> 00:10:47,544
Edison's one of the most
famous, most successful men

160
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,686
of his time.

161
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,195
But some facts
slip out of sight.

162
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:54,328
Tesla went to work for
Edison the same year,

163
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:57,458
the same summer that
Mary Edison died.

164
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,152
Congestion of the brain
was the official report,

165
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:03,285
code for a Morphine overdose.

166
00:11:03,351 --> 00:11:05,855
She was 15 when
they met in the rain

167
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:08,107
outside Edison's new workshop,

168
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:11,685
16 when they married,
25 when she died,

169
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:14,275
leaving Edison with
three young children

170
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:15,895
and a lot on his mind.

171
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:26,443
This, you might think, is
where Tesla's luck turns.

172
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:29,653
He finds investors and sets
up the Tesla Lighting Company,

173
00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:32,895
but his partners swindle
him, leaving him penniless.

174
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,269
He falls into the
abyss of poverty,

175
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:41,982
becomes a ditch digger
digging trenches for cables,

176
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,076
phone lines for Western Union.

177
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:53,438
After a humiliating year,
a sympathetic foreman

178
00:11:53,472 --> 00:11:57,187
introduces him to Alfred S.
Brown and Charles F. Peck.

179
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:04,084
They key is the motor
rotates by virtue of induction

180
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:06,492
of rotating magnetic fields.

181
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:08,627
I've eliminated the
commutator which distributes

182
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,153
electricity to the rotor.

183
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:13,004
So you've eliminated the
need for the commutator

184
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:14,413
and brushes the sparks.

185
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:15,369
Amazing.

186
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:16,716
There are no sparks.

187
00:12:16,763 --> 00:12:17,578
Is that so bad?

188
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,083
They're just unnecessary.

189
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:21,116
The magnetic field
redirects the current.

190
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:22,102
May I?

191
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:26,033
The work you did for
Edison, what was it?

192
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:29,099
I redesigned 24
different dynamos,

193
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:30,684
standard machines,

194
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,688
replaced longer magnets
with short coils,

195
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:35,943
replaced older models.

196
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:38,697
I couldn't interest him
in alternating current,

197
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:39,446
but of course you know...

198
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:40,923
I know, I'm an electrician.

199
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:41,527
But he...

200
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:43,001
The lawyer, the sensible one.

201
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,235
He understands...

202
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:46,545
This is more
than just a motor.

203
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:49,355
It is entire system

204
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,434
for generating, transmitting,
and utilizing power.

205
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:58,397
You were making $15 a
week with Edison, correct?

206
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:00,171
We checked.

207
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,900
Edison
hires the best,

208
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:04,611
but he practically makes
them pay for the privilege.

209
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:05,853
We have capital.

210
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:09,838
$50,000 for an
Annual sinking fund

211
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,311
and alternating current...

212
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,619
I don't
care if it's dangerous.

213
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:13,556
It isn't.

214
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:14,348
Edison says...

215
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,524
Fire is dangerous
if you stick your hand in it.

216
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:19,226
We'll set
you up with a lab

217
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:20,458
and a salary.

218
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:23,610
$250 a month.

219
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:28,328
It's better than you
were expecting, is it?

220
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:58,013
I understand your mother is
not very impressed with me.

221
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:05,764
Edison met his second
wife, Mina Miller, in 1885.

222
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:12,799
My mother regards our earthly
existence as insignificant.

223
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,258
Her father
had made a fortune

224
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:17,517
by inventing a
popular lawnmower,

225
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:18,830
the Buckeye Reaper.

226
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:21,982
The youngest of seven
children, she was engaged

227
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,862
to marry a preacher's son.

228
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,161
She says when you
leave this life,

229
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:31,739
you enter into a brighter
and happier life,

230
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:33,693
one that never ends.

231
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,917
You know what my
mother said to me?

232
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,915
Never eat anything
bigger than your head.

233
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:03,237
I am going to ask your father

234
00:15:04,832 --> 00:15:06,414
if I can

235
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,215
teach you morse code.

236
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:16,286
So we can talk without talking.

237
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,943
Instead of a single coil,

238
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:25,787
we use four.

239
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:29,440
Four coils around
a laminated ring.

240
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:34,786
Two separate AC currents
feed into the paired coils

241
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:36,647
on opposite sides.

242
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:38,938
The currents are out of phase.

243
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:43,062
This creates the rotating
electrical field.

244
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:46,932
No sparks.

245
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,552
I was with him in Budapest

246
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:53,654
when he had the idea.

247
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:57,952
He saw it in his head and then

248
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,813
he draw it in the dirt.

249
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,290
I did.

250
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:04,992
That was five years ago.

251
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:08,821
And here we are now.

252
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,005
New Orleans, St. Paul,
Chicago, Philadelphia, Brooklyn.

253
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:23,903
Edison has 121 power
stations in the U.S.

254
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:30,340
Plus Berlin and Milan, Paris,
Bordeaux, Amsterdam, Munich.

255
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:32,318
Everywhere.

256
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:35,912
When we get this across, it's
going to rewrite the book.

257
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:38,291
It's going to
knock him sideways.

258
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:45,199
What is this can?

259
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:46,505
It's a prototype.

260
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:49,475
You expect me to invest
in a spinning tin can

261
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:50,547
of shoe polish?

262
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:51,839
I do.

263
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,207
That motor

264
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:55,502
will do the work of the world.

265
00:16:58,376 --> 00:16:59,843
It'll set men free.

266
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:42,146
It's perfect.

267
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:43,607
I congratulate you.

268
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,765
Its efficiency without
question is equal

269
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:48,562
to the best direct
current motor.

270
00:17:48,595 --> 00:17:52,900
In terms of voltage potentials,
it can have no match.

271
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:54,568
The best machine
is the one with

272
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,525
the fewest parts.

273
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:59,444
It's the solution
everyone's been searching for.

274
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:00,975
Where have you been hiding?

275
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:02,077
What do you mean?

276
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:04,412
You're not a
member of the AIEE.

277
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:05,440
American
Institute of...

278
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:07,081
Or the National
Electric Light Association

279
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:09,317
or the Electric
Club of New York.

280
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:11,885
Your endorsement means
a great deal to us.

281
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,839
To all
of us, Professor.

282
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,824
Mr. Tesla has been
keeping a low profile.

283
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:18,844
That will change.

284
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:19,854
I can tell ya,

285
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,935
the patent office will not
accept the application.

286
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,398
What do you mean?

287
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:26,923
You think you can
jam all you've done

288
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,151
into a single omnibus patent?

289
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:30,682
You'll have to break it up

290
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:32,913
into half a dozen
separate inventions.

291
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:38,012
Well that's how I see it.

292
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:40,279
We're at a turning point in
the history of human engin...

293
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:41,260
Sorry I'm late.

294
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:43,240
Ah, Evelyn.

295
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:46,419
This is

296
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:48,739
Mr. Tesla,

297
00:18:50,123 --> 00:18:54,120
Mr. Peck, and Mr. Brown, his
business partners and Mr...

298
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,759
Antoni Szigeti.

299
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,085
Tesla's assistant.

300
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:00,971
My
niece Evelyn and?

301
00:19:01,064 --> 00:19:01,898
Anne.

302
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:06,537
Excuse me, I'm a
creature of habit.

303
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:08,642
Sit down.

304
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:10,311
Look at Mr. Tesla's motor.

305
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:11,946
It's gonna make him very famous.

306
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:17,939
Well in that case, we
can split my sandwich.

307
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:28,405
Do you like snow?

308
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:30,163
Looks like we're gonna
get a lot more of it.

309
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:33,814
Go ahead, show 'em.

310
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:35,523
He's eliminated the
commutator and the sparks

311
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,192
to go with it.

312
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:40,074
My uncle likes machines
more than people.

313
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,108
Do I?

314
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,310
Possibly.

315
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,274
Machines is an
extension of people,

316
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:47,198
not as the opposite of people.

317
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,087
Nothing touches.

318
00:19:53,176 --> 00:19:53,921
That's right.

319
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:55,168
No sparks.

320
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:00,527
The new machines
have something extra.

321
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,103
When my cousin died,
I started to feel

322
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:05,431
she was with me when
I turned on the light.

323
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:06,521
Electric light.

324
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,669
It was as though there was
something in the current

325
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:11,269
and the light in the air that

326
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,150
allowed her to linger.

327
00:20:41,202 --> 00:20:44,280
I now have the pleasure
of introducing you

328
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,130
to a novel system of
electrical transformation

329
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:49,762
and distribution of energy

330
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:52,077
by means of alternate currents.

331
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:59,432
My notice was rather brief,

332
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,943
so I would be very much
gratified if the little work

333
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:06,299
I've done meets
with your approval.

334
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,496
The importance of
maintaining the intensity

335
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,627
of the all constant

336
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,406
is that if this can be
produced, we can utilize

337
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:26,414
instead of the
sub-divider armature

338
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,215
an ordinary still pock.

339
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:29,283
Get me out of here.

340
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,392
Westinghouse.

341
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:39,740
George Westinghouse.

342
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,700
He wants the motor, of course.

343
00:21:42,797 --> 00:21:45,749
We are telling him that
another party is involved,

344
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:49,339
a San Francisco capitalist
offering $200,000.

345
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:54,083
Plus $2.50 per
house power, royalty

346
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:56,883
for each motor reinstalled.

347
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:58,078
That is strategy.

348
00:21:58,112 --> 00:21:59,017
Employ it.

349
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:00,915
You can go along
with this, can't you?

350
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:04,318
There's nobody else, really.

351
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:06,186
Westinghouse is the only
one who has the cash.

352
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,355
The cash and the guts.

353
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,723
George Westinghouse was 16

354
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:13,094
when he enlisted
in the Civil War.

355
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,362
Served in the Navy
on the northern side

356
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:17,630
and was promoted to Corporal.

357
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:21,368
When he was 21, he invented
the air break for trains

358
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:24,577
and made a fortune because
all the railroads needed it.

359
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:26,964
He was an inventor
and businessman,

360
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:28,209
a rare mix.

361
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:30,544
Doesn't mind buying
other people's patents,

362
00:22:30,578 --> 00:22:32,313
working them in
to bigger schemes.

363
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:34,614
He hates self-promotion.

364
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:37,918
Google him and you get
just five million results.

365
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,373
He met his wife,
Marguerite, on a train.

366
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:47,490
Westinghouse buy Tesla's patents

367
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:50,231
for over a million
dollars in today's money

368
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:52,099
and enlists Tesla to
come to his home base

369
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:53,509
to oversee production.

370
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:00,979
Royalties for every
motor sold assure Tesla

371
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,578
more millions, an accumulating
fortune in years to come.

372
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:06,687
Ah.

373
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:10,918
You know this man, Brown?

374
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:12,452
Works for Edison?

375
00:23:13,454 --> 00:23:15,209
Harold P. Brown?

376
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:19,253
I know an Alfred S.
Brown, an associate.

377
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:23,164
Sure, Brown's a pretty
common American name.

378
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:25,813
Brown and Green,
two color names.

379
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:29,203
I knew an Orange once, James.

380
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:31,738
But he pronounced it Oranje.

381
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:36,159
Anyway, Harold P. Brown has
bought some of our machines

382
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:39,784
on the sly and has Westinghouse,
that's what he calls it,

383
00:23:40,261 --> 00:23:43,583
24 dogs purchased from children

384
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,541
for 25 cents each.

385
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:48,298
What I'm does, and
I'm sure you've heard,

386
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:50,699
in the name of science
is he zaps the dog

387
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:53,594
with 14 hundred volts
of direct current.

388
00:23:54,117 --> 00:23:57,688
Without fatal results and
then kills the same dog

389
00:23:57,735 --> 00:24:02,203
with 400 to 800 of
Westinghouse current.

390
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:13,699
Sorry about the noise.

391
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:14,910
And the heat.

392
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:19,165
Pittsburgh has its charms but

393
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:20,550
they can seem...

394
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,904
Brown's challenged me

395
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:35,947
to a duel.

396
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:40,824
He wants me to bring a
machine and go to New York

397
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:44,277
and expose myself
to electric shocks,

398
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:46,376
alternating current, of course

399
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:49,683
while he receives
direct current.

400
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:53,420
We shall commence with 100 volts

401
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:57,734
and then increase by 50
volts until one or the other

402
00:24:57,804 --> 00:25:00,894
publicly admits his error.

403
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,513
I'll do it.

404
00:25:05,908 --> 00:25:08,455
Well that's very kind
of you, but even if I

405
00:25:08,518 --> 00:25:12,505
or you submitted to such
an imbecilic adventure,

406
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,784
they're still gearing
up to execute Kemmler.

407
00:25:16,777 --> 00:25:18,078
Kemmler?

408
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:19,530
The ax murderer.

409
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:20,785
Now, to be fair,

410
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,594
he used a hatchet.

411
00:25:26,084 --> 00:25:27,182
I had to do it.

412
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:30,424
I wanted to kill her
and the sooner I hang,

413
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:31,665
the better it'll be.

414
00:25:33,521 --> 00:25:36,942
Instead of hanging,
there's a move to electrocute

415
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:40,357
and our friend, Edison,
is going to testify

416
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:42,369
suggesting they put
an end to Kemmler

417
00:25:42,403 --> 00:25:45,230
using a Westinghouse machine.

418
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,402
He's running scared.

419
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,098
Garcal?

420
00:25:52,147 --> 00:25:53,022
Lemonade.

421
00:25:54,365 --> 00:25:55,518
You want a lemonade?

422
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,928
No, thank you.

423
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,958
AC versus DC.

424
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:04,946
People think it's a
difference of opinion

425
00:26:05,016 --> 00:26:06,627
but we know better.

426
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,229
You know I reached
out to Edison.

427
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:11,948
Invited him here,
suggested a merger.

428
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,931
He's too busy, he wrote back.

429
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:19,634
"Working in my lab
consumes all my time."

430
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:31,321
It's war.

431
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:53,884
Your name?

432
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:57,541
Thomas Alva Edison.

433
00:26:57,614 --> 00:26:59,756
And what
is your calling or profession?

434
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:00,882
Inventor.

435
00:27:00,941 --> 00:27:02,911
Have you devoted
a great deal of time

436
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:04,566
to the subject of electricity?

437
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:07,843
Yes, of course.

438
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:08,819
All right.

439
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:11,206
And how long have you
engaged in your work

440
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,373
as inventor or electrician?

441
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:15,793
26 years.

442
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,689
Now, can you tell us...

443
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:19,233
can you state

444
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,435
the necessary strength of
current needed in order

445
00:27:21,468 --> 00:27:24,905
to produce death in all cases?

446
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,223
Well I'm opposed to
capital punishment.

447
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:30,010
The
question did not arise

448
00:27:30,113 --> 00:27:33,115
do we as individuals believe
in capital punishment.

449
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:36,966
The practice has been
in existence by law

450
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:39,386
in all ages in all nations

451
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,051
and probably will for
all of time to come.

452
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:47,294
Now, Mr. Edison, explain
the difference between

453
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,329
continuous or direct current

454
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:50,679
and alternating current.

455
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:54,080
Direct current flows
like water through a pipe.

456
00:27:54,942 --> 00:27:58,571
Alternating current is the
same as if a body of water

457
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:02,337
were allowed to flow through
a pipe in one direction

458
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,125
for a given amount of
time and then reversed

459
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:07,780
for a given amount of time.

460
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,950
Direct current is like a
river flowing peacefully

461
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:11,185
to the sea.

462
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:13,899
Alternating current
is like a current

463
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:16,263
rushing violently
over a precipice.

464
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,327
Now have you measured

465
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,422
the electrical resistance
of human beings?

466
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:23,964
Yes, I have.

467
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:26,133
Can an artificial
current be generated

468
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:29,111
and applied in such a
manner as to produce death

469
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,171
in human beings in every case?

470
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:32,172
Yes.

471
00:28:32,307 --> 00:28:33,575
Instantly?

472
00:28:35,956 --> 00:28:37,157
Instantly?

473
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,485
Yes.

474
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:50,390
Thank you.

475
00:28:50,517 --> 00:28:51,677
Mr. Cochran.

476
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:55,941
I'm concerned, Mr.
Edison, that different men

477
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,543
in your experiments demonstrate
at different resistance.

478
00:29:00,393 --> 00:29:01,062
What would the effect be...

479
00:29:01,096 --> 00:29:02,269
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

480
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,238
I can't hear you,
you'll have to speak up.

481
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm worried that the current
will have unforeseen effect.

482
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:11,105
Now what would the
effect be on Kemmler

483
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,481
if we were to apply the current
for five or six minutes?

484
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,941
Now, wait a minute.

485
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,590
What your saying...

486
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:19,787
If we
applied the current

487
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:22,227
for five or six minutes,
what will happen to Kemmler,

488
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:23,784
will he not be carbonized?

489
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:26,815
No, he'd be mummified.

490
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,060
All the moisture in his
body would evaporate.

491
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,754
But that's the hardly point.

492
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:32,403
Mr. Edison...

493
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:35,269
Just 1,000 volts
of one amp current

494
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:37,777
is 10 times as much as
you need to kill any man

495
00:29:37,832 --> 00:29:40,507
with the Westinghouse
alternator.

496
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:44,645
Westinghouse uses
2,000 more volts.

497
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:55,990
Suppose a man touches a
wire in a wet place, well

498
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,433
that's a dead man.

499
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:01,763
This is your belief.

500
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:03,530
What's that?

501
00:30:03,665 --> 00:30:05,732
This is
your belief, correct?

502
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:07,668
This is not based on knowledge?

503
00:30:07,802 --> 00:30:08,843
Oh, correct.

504
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:11,261
I never killed anybody.

505
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:26,154
Your friends from school?

506
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:30,006
Colleagues in Budapest
eight years ago.

507
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:32,426
Friends, yes.

508
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:34,494
And then Paris.

509
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:36,351
He's an inventor as well.

510
00:30:38,098 --> 00:30:43,071
But I seem to have a gift
for helping other inventors.

511
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:47,866
You remind me of my cat.

512
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,487
If I were to interview my cat,

513
00:30:52,573 --> 00:30:54,330
I feel I'd have to
prepare in advance

514
00:30:54,364 --> 00:30:56,467
to ask him really
interesting questions.

515
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:04,184
Where are you from?

516
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:06,308
He's from a small village

517
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:07,988
in the Austrian Empire.

518
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:10,297
Humble beginnings.

519
00:31:10,478 --> 00:31:11,857
Like Abraham Lincoln.

520
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,452
He has many fond memory.

521
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:17,307
Yes.

522
00:31:19,073 --> 00:31:20,008
I remember

523
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:22,509
when I was 17, summertime,

524
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,478
I lived in the country.

525
00:31:24,612 --> 00:31:26,881
There was a Cholera epidemic.

526
00:31:26,983 --> 00:31:31,052
They burned trees in the streets
to ward away evil spirits

527
00:31:31,186 --> 00:31:34,226
and drank infected
water, died like dogs.

528
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:45,529
I just realized
Mr. Tesla and Mr.?

529
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:46,342
Szigeti.

530
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:46,959
Yes.

531
00:31:46,993 --> 00:31:49,903
Just realized how late it
is and somebody's father

532
00:31:49,937 --> 00:31:52,205
expects her home on the hour.

533
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:53,338
He doesn't care.

534
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:00,171
You know who my
father is of course?

535
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,433
Yes.

536
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:07,362
Do you consider my father a
malignant force in the world?

537
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:11,525
A person who amasses a
fortune like a pirate

538
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:12,638
or a gangster?

539
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,132
Who acquires power by exploiting
workers, and resources,

540
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:21,268
and rigging markets, and
manipulating economies,

541
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:22,031
and so forth?

542
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:24,804
Or is he a
captain of industry?

543
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,941
Are his actions positive?

544
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,945
Does he in fact expand
markets, and provide more jobs,

545
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:34,341
and give vast sums of money
to those less fortunate?

546
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:38,620
This young lady's in my care
and I must get her home.

547
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:45,754
Til soon,

548
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:47,930
Mr. Tesla.

549
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:54,828
Yes, we may see
you again soon.

550
00:32:56,705 --> 00:32:57,637
Or sooner.

551
00:32:57,765 --> 00:32:58,824
You never can tell.

552
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,384
Anne Morgan,

553
00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:23,919
daughter of J. Pierpont Morgan.

554
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:28,534
My father preferred
to be called Pierpont.

555
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,337
Pierpont Morgan.

556
00:33:30,453 --> 00:33:32,260
At that time and
for decades to come,

557
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:34,741
one of the wealthiest
men in the world.

558
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,177
He was born rich,

559
00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:38,745
entered the family
banking business early on.

560
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:41,314
In 1861 when he was 24,

561
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:44,157
he married his first
wife, Amelia Sturges.

562
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,787
He took her to Europe
after they were married,

563
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:48,956
she was diagnosed with
Tuberculosis and died

564
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,624
four months later.

565
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:51,768
He was shattered.

566
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:56,226
He buried himself in
work, banking, finance,

567
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:59,033
buying and trading
companies and corporations.

568
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:03,284
I don't think he ever asked
who strokes the cat's back.

569
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:07,837
He married Frances Louisa
Tracy and had four children.

570
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:09,754
I'm the youngest.

571
00:34:16,608 --> 00:34:19,232
He hired Thomas Edison
to install electricity

572
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,756
in our Madison Avenue mansion,

573
00:34:22,243 --> 00:34:23,791
the first private
residence in New York

574
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:25,773
illuminated by Edison's light.

575
00:34:26,794 --> 00:34:28,495
While Tesla was
refining his designs

576
00:34:28,582 --> 00:34:30,359
for the perfect induction motor,

577
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,973
my father was pouring millions

578
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:35,426
into the Edison General
Electric Company.

579
00:34:40,274 --> 00:34:41,309
Hmm.

580
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:43,042
A woman like that,

581
00:34:43,922 --> 00:34:45,980
she can make all

582
00:34:46,123 --> 00:34:47,494
your dreams

583
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:48,633
come true.

584
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:53,860
Well my dreams are true.

585
00:34:55,786 --> 00:34:56,620
Yeah.

586
00:34:57,755 --> 00:34:59,769
But you lack funding.

587
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,993
I will

588
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,252
delight in working of the

589
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,679
nerve to show.

590
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:24,718
It's a compass

591
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:27,024
for steering ships at sea.

592
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:37,606
It's good.

593
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:42,588
Yes, it's very good.

594
00:35:45,283 --> 00:35:46,184
But,

595
00:35:49,235 --> 00:35:51,498
Sir William Thompson's
done it already.

596
00:35:54,849 --> 00:35:56,562
Lord Calvin.

597
00:35:57,173 --> 00:36:00,453
if you want, I can
show you the journal.

598
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,735
Well,

599
00:36:08,037 --> 00:36:09,638
I should have showed you sooner.

600
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:12,368
Yes.

601
00:36:35,502 --> 00:36:38,113
Ah yes, well good luck with

602
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:40,528
Anne Morgan.

603
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:05,633
Gentlemen,

604
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:09,554
this is William Kemmler.

605
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:18,266
I wish you all good luck.

606
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:26,039
I believe I am going
to a good place and

607
00:37:26,237 --> 00:37:27,497
I am ready to go.

608
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:54,135
And there's no rush.

609
00:37:54,354 --> 00:37:55,896
Let's get this right.

610
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,385
I don't wanna take any
chances on this thing.

611
00:37:59,013 --> 00:37:59,812
You know?

612
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,115
Anne is very upset.

613
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:16,323
She says you live in your head.

614
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:17,691
Doesn't everyone?

615
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:23,739
Too much in your head, I
think she feels left out.

616
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,556
Sometimes it seems as
though all I do is think.

617
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,478
For days or weeks on end.

618
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:35,675
Have you seen this?

619
00:38:35,841 --> 00:38:36,677
Late edition?

620
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,914
They made a thorough
botch of it.

621
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:40,921
Gruesome.

622
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:44,094
Like my brain's burning.

623
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:46,909
Who could live with that?

624
00:38:52,003 --> 00:38:54,609
When I thought to
sleep out all my faults,

625
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:58,205
I found that some had stuffed
the bed with thoughts.

626
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:01,268
I would say thorns.

627
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:03,512
With a click
of the lever, Kemmler's body

628
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,151
straightened and seemed as
though it might be thrown across

629
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:09,350
the chamber, were it not for
the straps which held it.

630
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:11,032
What is that?

631
00:39:11,495 --> 00:39:12,980
Post.

632
00:39:13,195 --> 00:39:16,110
The body was as rigid
as though cast and bronze,

633
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:18,752
save for the index
finger of the right hand,

634
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:21,266
which closed up so tightly
that the nail penetrated

635
00:39:21,328 --> 00:39:24,344
the flesh on the first
joint and blood trickled out

636
00:39:24,378 --> 00:39:25,792
on the arm of the chair.

637
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:33,814
There were two or three
doctors with stopwatches,

638
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:35,631
they saw Kemmler
still breathing.

639
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:43,025
He wasn't dead.

640
00:39:45,656 --> 00:39:47,481
They got the machine
started up again,

641
00:39:47,648 --> 00:39:49,583
gave him another thousand volts.

642
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:51,824
Well that did it.

643
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:55,714
What was Kemmler
convicted for?

644
00:39:58,682 --> 00:39:59,905
Killed his wife.

645
00:39:59,984 --> 00:40:01,095
Was Edison there?

646
00:40:01,688 --> 00:40:02,890
He's in Paris.

647
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,460
Seven of his company
as they're merging

648
00:40:04,494 --> 00:40:07,458
with international outlets,
backed by Deutsche Bank.

649
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,912
And Drexel Morgan Company.

650
00:40:19,323 --> 00:40:20,571
Morgan.

651
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:30,925
Blame the doctors.

652
00:40:31,004 --> 00:40:32,904
They applied the current
to the top of his head.

653
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:34,244
Hair is not conductive.

654
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:37,298
They should put his
hand in a jar of water.

655
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,936
They'll get it right next time.

656
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:05,877
You're indulging me

657
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:07,352
because of my father.

658
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,008
No.

659
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:13,417
I came to wonder,

660
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:17,005
could any woman ever reach

661
00:41:17,115 --> 00:41:19,573
or touch Tesla?

662
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:21,157
The way his mother had?

663
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,781
He had a vision just
before she died.

664
00:41:27,923 --> 00:41:31,752
Easter Sunday at one a.m., 1892.

665
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,188
After her funeral, he fell ill

666
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,519
and spent three weeks living
like a shadow in the village

667
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:37,758
where she was born.

668
00:41:38,617 --> 00:41:42,229
Then he rebounded, gave
a lecture in Belgrade

669
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,368
and came home.

670
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:45,478
No.

671
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:51,483
You think of people as
machines, but you're wrong.

672
00:41:51,936 --> 00:41:52,960
- They aren't.
- I said

673
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:54,842
the universe is a machine.

674
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:55,909
No.

675
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:58,564
We have an outside
and an inside.

676
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,773
We have wills and souls.

677
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:07,016
I'm fine.

678
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:14,448
It's just sometimes
I have a rather

679
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,936
unfavorable reaction to pearls.

680
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,554
Leave us alone.

681
00:42:48,185 --> 00:42:49,219
My father...

682
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:57,920
You should meet my father.

683
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:01,394
He's good with numbers
and objects, like you.

684
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:03,139
I would like to meet him.

685
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,596
If he isn't too
busy helping Edison.

686
00:43:07,259 --> 00:43:08,629
Watch out for his nose.

687
00:43:08,707 --> 00:43:09,683
His what?

688
00:43:10,201 --> 00:43:11,298
His nose.

689
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:13,778
You've heard about it, I assume?

690
00:43:16,205 --> 00:43:17,827
The richest man in
the world and he has

691
00:43:17,884 --> 00:43:19,461
a hideous skin disease.

692
00:43:20,156 --> 00:43:23,695
Inflaming and
disfiguring his nose.

693
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,198
He dares you to pretend
you don't see it.

694
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:30,024
Maybe it will happen to me,

695
00:43:30,104 --> 00:43:32,338
it's just a matter of time.

696
00:43:34,374 --> 00:43:36,343
Maybe I'd be better
off without a nose,

697
00:43:37,259 --> 00:43:38,393
like the sphinx.

698
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:44,251
When are you going to Chicago?

699
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:46,520
How did you know about that?

700
00:43:46,669 --> 00:43:48,989
Westinghouse is installing
hundreds of dynamos.

701
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:51,024
250,000 light bulbs.

702
00:43:51,114 --> 00:43:52,459
I leave tomorrow.

703
00:43:53,102 --> 00:43:54,303
With your friend?

704
00:43:54,892 --> 00:43:55,929
The Hungarian?

705
00:43:56,765 --> 00:43:58,005
Szigeti?

706
00:43:58,194 --> 00:43:58,722
No.

707
00:43:58,785 --> 00:44:00,186
He lost his compass.

708
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:03,835
He went to South America
to seek his fortune.

709
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:07,274
But wasn't he your

710
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:08,424
best friend?

711
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,805
I can visit you in Chicago.

712
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,359
That's not necessary.

713
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:27,261
Thank you, no.

714
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,602
You need me.

715
00:44:34,447 --> 00:44:36,838
Thinking, my father taught me,

716
00:44:37,036 --> 00:44:39,139
is more interesting than knowing

717
00:44:39,337 --> 00:44:41,909
but less interesting
than lucking.

718
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:45,722
That's one way to size
up the pavilion of light

719
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:48,777
at the World's Fair
in Chicago 1893,

720
00:44:49,945 --> 00:44:52,935
where the new Tesla Westinghouse
machines provide power

721
00:44:52,997 --> 00:44:54,224
and illumination.

722
00:44:55,089 --> 00:44:57,232
The fair consumes three
times more electricity

723
00:44:57,318 --> 00:44:59,226
than the whole city itself.

724
00:44:59,425 --> 00:45:01,607
28 million visitors
from around the world

725
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:04,565
and they all see what
Edison has tried to deny,

726
00:45:04,775 --> 00:45:08,045
alternating current
is beautiful and safe.

727
00:45:13,554 --> 00:45:15,156
Ahh.

728
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:16,466
Thank you for joining me.

729
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,334
Please.

730
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:21,693
I took the liberty,

731
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:23,130
ordered for us both.

732
00:45:23,216 --> 00:45:25,118
An American meal.

733
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,244
Pie.

734
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:29,775
So you've been to my exhibition,

735
00:45:29,841 --> 00:45:31,924
the tower, the Edison column.

736
00:45:33,919 --> 00:45:36,381
18,000 bulbs literally

737
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:39,566
surrounded by 25 hundred
different types of Edison lamps.

738
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:40,846
Go ahead, it's fresh.

739
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:42,821
Well, I'm an American now.

740
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:43,782
Full-fledged citizen.

741
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:44,938
Yes, yes, of course you are.

742
00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:45,703
Of course.

743
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:48,354
As I was saying, it's
really on display.

744
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:52,613
Edison dynamos, flat irons,
sewing machine motors,

745
00:45:52,692 --> 00:45:54,754
dinging room fans, elevators.

746
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,960
I like the dolls.

747
00:45:56,994 --> 00:45:57,545
The dolls?

748
00:45:57,579 --> 00:45:58,655
They're very amusing.

749
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,298
Hmm, the talking dolls.

750
00:46:00,376 --> 00:46:02,222
We rushed it, it's not perfect.

751
00:46:03,121 --> 00:46:05,726
Kinetscope, moving pictures.

752
00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:07,727
Everybody will like that.

753
00:46:09,564 --> 00:46:11,865
But I invited you, here you are.

754
00:46:13,165 --> 00:46:14,666
Tesla, it's plain as day.

755
00:46:16,017 --> 00:46:18,361
This entire World's
Fair is lit and powered

756
00:46:18,395 --> 00:46:20,073
by alternating current.

757
00:46:20,317 --> 00:46:23,107
Westinghouse
machines, your design.

758
00:46:24,654 --> 00:46:27,047
I was wrong about
alternating current.

759
00:46:27,876 --> 00:46:29,511
I was wrong about you.

760
00:46:29,966 --> 00:46:32,354
I still have capital,
I still have investors.

761
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,994
An unmatched capacity for PR.

762
00:46:36,075 --> 00:46:37,460
Let's reset the clocks.

763
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:40,586
Bygones be bygones.

764
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:43,270
You must have all
sorts of ideas.

765
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:45,599
Pick a project,

766
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:48,749
something incredible, huh?

767
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:55,531
We can do incredible
things together, huh?

768
00:46:57,487 --> 00:46:59,021
What do you wanna do next?

769
00:47:02,344 --> 00:47:03,212
Got a light?

770
00:47:05,382 --> 00:47:06,985
Do you have a light?

771
00:47:20,187 --> 00:47:22,636
This meeting
never happened.

772
00:47:22,855 --> 00:47:25,739
Edison and Tesla didn't
talk at the World Fair.

773
00:47:25,941 --> 00:47:27,280
Edison never
admitted he was wrong

774
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,196
about alternating current.

775
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,613
There was no apology,
no reconciliation.

776
00:47:33,258 --> 00:47:35,083
And you can't hep but wonder,

777
00:47:35,413 --> 00:47:38,548
if only Tesla had someone
sharp and smart at his side,

778
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:41,469
an enlightened hustler
to steer him through

779
00:47:41,503 --> 00:47:43,270
the crass, commercial world.

780
00:47:46,713 --> 00:47:47,763
If only.

781
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:17,640
Dr. Tesla.

782
00:48:18,138 --> 00:48:19,306
He's waiting for you.

783
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:26,690
Ah.

784
00:48:27,129 --> 00:48:28,573
I know you don't like to

785
00:48:29,262 --> 00:48:30,996
shake hands, I've taken note.

786
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:33,074
Excuse me, watch your toes.

787
00:48:33,354 --> 00:48:36,281
I was assured this
was an out of the way

788
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,179
meeting place but it's...

789
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,986
I was misinformed.

790
00:48:41,963 --> 00:48:42,796
Let's

791
00:48:43,696 --> 00:48:44,530
maybe.

792
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:48,735
Yeah.

793
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:56,329
Edison sunk.

794
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:58,032
He's on the ropes.

795
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,466
We beat him.

796
00:48:59,718 --> 00:49:01,735
It was never about Edison.

797
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,754
He was simply on the
wrong side of the street.

798
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:09,021
My legal bills would suggest

799
00:49:11,322 --> 00:49:13,385
it's a bit more ugly than that.

800
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:16,793
'Cause

801
00:49:16,882 --> 00:49:18,366
here's the thing,

802
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:29,818
Westinghouse Electric is
fighting for its life.

803
00:49:30,503 --> 00:49:33,600
The economy and
the Edison merger.

804
00:49:33,676 --> 00:49:35,812
I'm sure you understand this.

805
00:49:37,803 --> 00:49:40,607
Even with the Niagara Commission

806
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,275
on our side,

807
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:45,378
JP Morgan is pulling
all the strings.

808
00:49:46,124 --> 00:49:49,130
We don't stand a chance
unless we initiate

809
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:51,293
a similar merger on our side.

810
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:55,912
My new Board of Directors

811
00:49:57,499 --> 00:49:58,334
says

812
00:50:00,022 --> 00:50:04,489
if I pay you the royalties
spelled out in your contract,

813
00:50:06,162 --> 00:50:07,232
we're bust.

814
00:50:08,263 --> 00:50:09,837
It's too much money.

815
00:50:10,027 --> 00:50:12,019
The whole company's in jeopardy.

816
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:16,244
They refuse

817
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:18,132
to go forward with the merger

818
00:50:19,093 --> 00:50:24,221
unless your contract, the
horsepower clause, is canceled.

819
00:50:29,535 --> 00:50:32,505
Would you mind if we went
somewhere a little less dusty?

820
00:50:45,592 --> 00:50:47,130
You mean that if I give this up

821
00:50:47,164 --> 00:50:49,214
and the merger goes
through, you'll retain

822
00:50:49,248 --> 00:50:51,075
control of your company

823
00:50:51,688 --> 00:50:53,893
and the polyphase
system finally?

824
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:55,204
Yes, right.

825
00:50:55,274 --> 00:50:56,550
Finally.

826
00:50:56,841 --> 00:50:59,619
The whole country is put on AC,

827
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:01,330
on your machines.

828
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:04,591
Our machines.

829
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:06,660
Your polyphase system.

830
00:51:07,255 --> 00:51:09,124
You know how I feel about this.

831
00:51:09,158 --> 00:51:10,495
And if I refuse?

832
00:51:10,878 --> 00:51:12,834
You'll have to deal
with the bankers.

833
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:14,698
I wouldn't blame
you, but in that case

834
00:51:14,732 --> 00:51:16,666
I'd be clear out of the picture.

835
00:51:22,254 --> 00:51:23,770
A sensible
man would have said,

836
00:51:23,855 --> 00:51:26,858
"Wait a minute, let
me talk to my lawyer."

837
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,698
But Tesla...

838
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,653
Tear it up.

839
00:51:37,249 --> 00:51:38,267
Tear it up.

840
00:51:41,704 --> 00:51:44,386
I'd prefer if you tore it up.

841
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:04,853
You won't regret it.

842
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:07,122
We are going to Niagara.

843
00:52:07,156 --> 00:52:08,406
There's no stopping it.

844
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,623
All right.

845
00:52:12,002 --> 00:52:13,439
It's gonna be
okay, don't worry.

846
00:52:13,503 --> 00:52:15,781
There's more than one
way to skin a cat.

847
00:52:15,815 --> 00:52:16,841
Yes, I've heard that.

848
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:18,619
Do you think it's true?

849
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:19,827
Of course.

850
00:52:19,861 --> 00:52:21,664
Take it from an old cat skinner.

851
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:36,064
Sarah Bernhardt,
the divine Sarah.

852
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:40,044
The first internationally
famous celebrity superstar.

853
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,055
Legend has it, she once
dropped her handkerchief

854
00:52:48,094 --> 00:52:49,258
at Tesla's feet.

855
00:52:50,032 --> 00:52:51,232
Or was it her scarf?

856
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,977
She's in motion all her
life, traveling the globe.

857
00:52:56,904 --> 00:52:59,076
She makes her first appearance
on the American stage

858
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:01,681
in New York in 1881.

859
00:53:02,486 --> 00:53:04,854
At two in the morning
on her way to Boston,

860
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,363
she stops off in
Menlo Park, New Jersey

861
00:53:07,457 --> 00:53:10,628
to visit the wizard,
Thomas Alva Edison.

862
00:53:15,244 --> 00:53:17,514
Listen to me carefully.

863
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:20,500
Every moment now
is precious to me.

864
00:53:21,624 --> 00:53:23,768
I was the monster
in this riddle.

865
00:53:24,503 --> 00:53:27,379
I was insane with
incestuous passion.

866
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:31,595
Now I am drunk on an
infallible poison.

867
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:36,486
I can feel my pulses pushing
it icily into my feet,

868
00:53:36,551 --> 00:53:39,046
hands, and the roots of my hair.

869
00:53:47,036 --> 00:53:48,907
10 years later, she's back

870
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:52,281
for the Chicago World's
Fair and another grand tour.

871
00:54:07,624 --> 00:54:09,325
She travels in a
coffin, you know?

872
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,517
Which she sleeps in.

873
00:54:13,474 --> 00:54:14,993
She sleeps

874
00:54:15,027 --> 00:54:16,384
in a coffin.

875
00:54:16,643 --> 00:54:19,086
To prepare for the
reality of death.

876
00:54:19,909 --> 00:54:21,183
I'd like a coffin.

877
00:54:22,428 --> 00:54:24,697
Her motto is quand meme,

878
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,585
which translated
means all the same

879
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:33,000
or despite everything, even so.

880
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:34,230
No matter what?

881
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:37,108
Do you speak French?

882
00:54:40,075 --> 00:54:42,114
I can speak a few words...

883
00:54:42,964 --> 00:54:44,464
...even form some sentences.

884
00:54:47,114 --> 00:54:49,984
I would like to see you again.

885
00:54:50,548 --> 00:54:51,683
Will you come with me?

886
00:54:52,883 --> 00:54:57,888
Quand meme.

887
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,099
Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you.

888
00:55:21,158 --> 00:55:23,704
Robert Underwood Johnson,
the Century Magazine.

889
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,697
I and my wife...

890
00:55:25,751 --> 00:55:26,436
Catherine.

891
00:55:26,514 --> 00:55:27,948
We have been wanting
to see you in the flesh

892
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:29,790
for a very long time.

893
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:32,932
A very long time. It's so delightful.

894
00:55:33,026 --> 00:55:34,594
Overwhelming.

895
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,106
May I introduce?

896
00:55:36,175 --> 00:55:39,171
Do you know the
brilliant, Nikola Tesla?

897
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:42,148
I believe this looks like a sheet of paper burning in flames.

898
00:55:45,657 --> 00:55:47,008
Are you an actor?

899
00:55:49,463 --> 00:55:50,731
He looks like an actor.

900
00:55:51,404 --> 00:55:53,765
He's the greatest inventor of all time.

901
00:55:53,827 --> 00:55:55,883
The greatest
inventor of the age.

902
00:55:55,949 --> 00:55:57,184
He is shy.

903
00:56:02,499 --> 00:56:05,402
But you insist in looking
me directly in the eye?

904
00:56:06,528 --> 00:56:08,163
Yes, he does that.

905
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,541
Ah, the divine Miss Sarah,

906
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:15,538
you couldn't have been diviner.

907
00:56:19,049 --> 00:56:20,463
Of course you already know each other.

908
00:56:23,265 --> 00:56:24,361
Hello, Robert.

909
00:56:24,395 --> 00:56:27,618
Catherine, I don't believe
you know my wife, Mina.

910
00:56:27,652 --> 00:56:29,552
When you died I had
to hold my breath.

911
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:30,878
It was terrifying.

912
00:56:30,912 --> 00:56:32,215
Exactly how I felt.

913
00:56:32,249 --> 00:56:33,254
Bless
my wife, Catherine.

914
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:35,573
You know, I had Mr.
Tesla at my workshop

915
00:56:35,607 --> 00:56:36,456
nine years ago.

916
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,324
He lasted, what?

917
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:38,523
Six months.

918
00:56:38,557 --> 00:56:40,259
Six months, he quit.

919
00:56:41,994 --> 00:56:42,856
I didn't.

920
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:44,044
He thinks I owe him money.

921
00:56:44,078 --> 00:56:44,598
What was it?

922
00:56:44,632 --> 00:56:45,833
$50?

923
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:48,779
I know, I shouldn't
talk about money.

924
00:56:48,813 --> 00:56:50,469
I shouldn't needn't
really joke about money.

925
00:56:50,563 --> 00:56:53,607
Especially with someone
who has no sense of humor.

926
00:56:53,992 --> 00:56:54,826
Yes.

927
00:56:56,616 --> 00:56:58,217
It's all right, we're friends.

928
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:02,965
And now he makes
lots of money.

929
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:07,058
And his machines
outsell my machines.

930
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,230
Oh, yes.

931
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:13,934
Salt water taffy for
you from Florida.

932
00:57:14,593 --> 00:57:16,929
Because you have
everything else already.

933
00:57:18,376 --> 00:57:19,755
Where is your coffin?

934
00:57:26,963 --> 00:57:29,667
You can't look at me like
this without consequences.

935
00:57:30,636 --> 00:57:31,809
That's from a play.

936
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:34,958
We will see each other again.

937
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:40,260
No hard feelings.

938
00:57:46,218 --> 00:57:47,331
What
did you say to her?

939
00:57:47,365 --> 00:57:48,232
I didn't quite...

940
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:51,872
I asked about her coffin.

941
00:57:53,314 --> 00:57:55,192
I guess she keeps
it in her hotel.

942
00:58:16,154 --> 00:58:18,733
For the Niagara
hydroelectric power plant,

943
00:58:18,811 --> 00:58:21,321
Tesla designs
completely new machines,

944
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,385
unprecedented generators,
fives times bigger

945
00:58:24,441 --> 00:58:26,080
than anything ever built.

946
00:58:26,855 --> 00:58:30,952
Plus transformers, motors,
transmission lines, turbines.

947
00:58:32,917 --> 00:58:35,687
Revolutionary in
their power and range.

948
00:58:38,657 --> 00:58:41,148
He didn't invent
alternating current.

949
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:42,488
Nobody did.

950
00:58:43,212 --> 00:58:45,709
But his system makes it
practical and possible to use

951
00:58:45,796 --> 00:58:48,484
everywhere efficiently
throughout the world.

952
00:58:55,228 --> 00:58:56,539
His system had to be broken down

953
00:58:56,573 --> 00:58:58,508
into 40 fundamental patents.

954
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:04,128
Most valuable patent since the
invention of the telephone.

955
00:59:05,205 --> 00:59:06,745
We'll see about that.

956
00:59:06,815 --> 00:59:08,651
In St. Louis last
week, over 4,000 people

957
00:59:08,744 --> 00:59:10,411
attended his lecture.

958
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:13,135
Yale gave him an honorary
degree, then Columbia.

959
00:59:14,204 --> 00:59:16,443
You've seen the articles
in the magazine.

960
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,380
And now, already he
has eight new patents

961
00:59:21,453 --> 00:59:22,861
for wireless energy.

962
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:27,312
Electromagnetic pulses
using high frequency waves.

963
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:30,152
You know him.

964
00:59:30,264 --> 00:59:31,613
You've talked to him.

965
00:59:32,432 --> 00:59:34,142
Is he looking for an investor

966
00:59:35,217 --> 00:59:36,305
or a wife?

967
00:59:41,889 --> 00:59:44,499
Chastity is a path
to enlightenment.

968
00:59:45,461 --> 00:59:47,800
A great inventor
should never marry.

969
00:59:49,728 --> 00:59:51,296
You realize this?

970
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:55,339
We are what our
thoughts have made us.

971
00:59:56,365 --> 00:59:57,599
I believe that.

972
01:00:00,028 --> 01:00:02,103
So take care about
what you think.

973
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,264
Thoughts live,

974
01:00:04,571 --> 01:00:05,957
they travel far.

975
01:00:18,794 --> 01:00:21,516
My aim is to develop
an entirely new

976
01:00:21,571 --> 01:00:23,015
system of communication.

977
01:00:23,049 --> 01:00:23,568
Yes, you've said...

978
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,533
Using new principles.

979
01:00:25,603 --> 01:00:28,057
Electric symbols, voices even,

980
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,299
photographs transmitted
through the air.

981
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:31,849
Well you could load
your wireless boat

982
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,293
with a cargo of
dynamite, submerge it,

983
01:00:34,327 --> 01:00:36,869
make it swim along and
then explode the dynamite...

984
01:00:36,903 --> 01:00:38,758
- I could, but...
- it'll blow up, say,

985
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:39,941
- a battleship?
- But I was thinking

986
01:00:39,975 --> 01:00:40,663
much bigger than that.

987
01:00:40,697 --> 01:00:41,768
Oh, it has many applications.

988
01:00:41,802 --> 01:00:44,274
Yes, it will transform
the way the world works.

989
01:00:44,371 --> 01:00:45,979
An entire system.

990
01:00:46,038 --> 01:00:46,905
I know.

991
01:00:49,662 --> 01:00:52,197
It's a paradox, yet true,

992
01:00:52,267 --> 01:00:55,022
that the more we learn,
the more ignorant we become

993
01:00:55,077 --> 01:00:57,070
in the absolute sense.

994
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:59,967
It's through enlightenment
that we are made aware

995
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:01,414
of our limitations.

996
01:01:02,128 --> 01:01:03,829
That's why I'm
going to Colorado.

997
01:01:09,447 --> 01:01:10,581
That's far.

998
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:16,694
Why?

999
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:20,486
The air, altitude,
lightning storms.

1000
01:01:23,702 --> 01:01:26,146
My brain is only a receiver.

1001
01:01:26,371 --> 01:01:28,406
In the universe, there
is a core from which

1002
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,156
we receive all
information, inspiration,

1003
01:01:32,206 --> 01:01:33,849
knowledge, and strength.

1004
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,273
I know it's not simple

1005
01:01:52,596 --> 01:01:54,379
to be able to love calmly.

1006
01:01:56,029 --> 01:01:58,230
To trust without fear.

1007
01:02:06,399 --> 01:02:08,780
To commit yourself to
really difficult tasks

1008
01:02:08,883 --> 01:02:11,664
with unlimited energy.

1009
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:19,225
Is it better to be
vindicated or to be loved?

1010
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:26,273
Idealism cannot work hand
in hand with capitalism.

1011
01:02:27,313 --> 01:02:28,149
True

1012
01:02:28,991 --> 01:02:30,070
or false?

1013
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:36,167
Are dreams and intelligence
enough to save the world?

1014
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:38,035
Is your

1015
01:02:39,306 --> 01:02:40,880
heightened ability,

1016
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:43,900
your brilliance

1017
01:02:47,909 --> 01:02:50,111
a blessing or a curse?

1018
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:56,987
You have become much
better at asking questions.

1019
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:01,246
In Colorado, Tesla
disappears into his work.

1020
01:04:05,601 --> 01:04:08,305
Conducting experiments that
have never been duplicated

1021
01:04:09,616 --> 01:04:10,908
or fully understood.

1022
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:19,384
He was synchronizing electricity
in the sky and the earth

1023
01:04:19,418 --> 01:04:22,287
with currents surging through
his magnifying transmitter.

1024
01:04:25,975 --> 01:04:27,863
A.K.A., a Tesla coil.

1025
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:42,440
It was like getting the
ocean to sit for a portrait.

1026
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,159
Salutations,
Miss Morgan

1027
01:05:29,235 --> 01:05:31,003
from the Alta Vista Hotel.

1028
01:05:31,793 --> 01:05:34,549
Mr. Lowenstein, my
associate from New York

1029
01:05:34,627 --> 01:05:37,134
has been troubled by
altitude sickness,

1030
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:41,189
but I am invigorated
by the climate.

1031
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:45,457
Skies of dazzling calm
alternating with storms

1032
01:05:45,543 --> 01:05:47,273
of great violence.

1033
01:05:47,366 --> 01:05:51,959
We have not seen Colorado's
legendary fireballs, but

1034
01:05:52,272 --> 01:05:54,650
I intend to generate
them myself.

1035
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:59,943
The essential aspects of my
work here must remain veiled,

1036
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:02,957
as they say, in secrecy.

1037
01:06:03,322 --> 01:06:07,347
When my results are revealed,
humanity will be like

1038
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:10,594
an ant heap stirred
up with a stick.

1039
01:06:11,945 --> 01:06:14,661
I've enlisted the aid
of a bright, local boy

1040
01:06:14,695 --> 01:06:18,739
who humbly assures us he doesn't
know what electricity is.

1041
01:06:19,047 --> 01:06:21,808
I tell him with
great seriousness,

1042
01:06:22,058 --> 01:06:24,844
"No one knows what it is."

1043
01:06:28,981 --> 01:06:33,739
Every human being is an engine
geared to the wheel work

1044
01:06:33,805 --> 01:06:35,134
of the universe.

1045
01:09:54,846 --> 01:09:55,436
You did that.

1046
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,171
The whole God damn
generator is on fire.

1047
01:09:57,233 --> 01:09:59,353
You threw a short on the line!

1048
01:09:59,392 --> 01:10:03,405
I set the earth an
electrical resonance.

1049
01:10:03,476 --> 01:10:05,400
You blacked out the
whole God damn town,

1050
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:06,626
you son of a bitch.

1051
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,260
You knocked out the generator.

1052
01:10:08,294 --> 01:10:11,505
I sent electrons
streaming into the earth

1053
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:16,104
at a rate of 150
oscillations per second,

1054
01:10:16,138 --> 01:10:20,440
each pulsation a
wavelength of 6,600 feet

1055
01:10:20,474 --> 01:10:24,217
and it expands, overflowing
the curve of the earth

1056
01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:29,574
creating a stationary
wave that arises and falls

1057
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,567
on the other side of the planet.

1058
01:10:31,608 --> 01:10:34,090
I will pay for a new generator.

1059
01:10:34,993 --> 01:10:36,263
Great.

1060
01:10:37,117 --> 01:10:38,685
My expense.

1061
01:10:50,894 --> 01:10:52,230
She's in the dining room.

1062
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,475
Ah.

1063
01:11:27,108 --> 01:11:29,649
You are the sole topic
of conversation here.

1064
01:11:29,947 --> 01:11:32,007
Well, other than me.

1065
01:11:36,504 --> 01:11:38,092
You work at night

1066
01:11:38,351 --> 01:11:39,952
in a secret laboratory.

1067
01:11:40,845 --> 01:11:41,875
No windows.

1068
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,629
You shoot lightnings
from the earth

1069
01:11:45,706 --> 01:11:46,908
to the sky.

1070
01:11:47,033 --> 01:11:49,369
And my only fear is
the very real possibility

1071
01:11:49,449 --> 01:11:51,617
that I may set the sky on fire.

1072
01:11:52,307 --> 01:11:54,839
It's as if I'm trying
to tame a wild cat

1073
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:58,236
and I have become nothing but
a mass of bloody scratches.

1074
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:01,181
Oh, you like being scratched?

1075
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:03,296
If necessary.

1076
01:12:04,548 --> 01:12:05,710
She was in Colorado

1077
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:08,022
for her second
worldwide farewell tour.

1078
01:12:08,683 --> 01:12:10,373
Or was it her third?

1079
01:12:10,467 --> 01:12:14,762
He was drawn to her, I guess,
for her fame and glamor

1080
01:12:15,128 --> 01:12:17,525
and for her unattainability.

1081
01:12:17,559 --> 01:12:20,857
Colorado's a bit
like a hospital ward.

1082
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:22,837
Have you noticed?

1083
01:12:23,216 --> 01:12:27,575
It's filled with rich
people with tuberculosis

1084
01:12:27,638 --> 01:12:30,643
pumping their lungs with
the pure mountain air.

1085
01:12:31,404 --> 01:12:33,173
They love the theater but

1086
01:12:33,777 --> 01:12:35,178
they cough a lot.

1087
01:12:36,683 --> 01:12:37,518
Champagne?

1088
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:40,991
I've been dying a lot lately.

1089
01:12:42,106 --> 01:12:44,191
Never the same death twice.

1090
01:12:44,585 --> 01:12:46,127
That's my specialty.

1091
01:12:46,433 --> 01:12:48,939
I've died so much
I feel immortal.

1092
01:12:49,042 --> 01:12:51,525
Well your English
is improving.

1093
01:12:51,599 --> 01:12:53,134
Well, maybe.

1094
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:58,669
But when I am on stage,
I perform only in French.

1095
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:04,089
Some Americans pay to see
the great French actress.

1096
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:14,507
There was a time when I hated death.

1097
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,910
I regret that now.

1098
01:13:16,317 --> 01:13:17,653
Death is necessary...

1099
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:19,746
...and I love it.

1100
01:13:20,425 --> 01:13:23,195
Because it waits for you before it strikes.

1101
01:13:26,879 --> 01:13:29,378
I can get you tickets to
Camille tomorrow night.

1102
01:13:30,122 --> 01:13:31,484
Well, tonight.

1103
01:13:32,064 --> 01:13:34,108
If the lights come back on.

1104
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,721
I'll make
sure they come back on

1105
01:13:35,784 --> 01:13:37,432
before the curtain comes up.

1106
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:16,092
Suppose

1107
01:14:18,002 --> 01:14:19,904
you had to cut your head off

1108
01:14:20,852 --> 01:14:23,021
and give it to someone else,

1109
01:14:23,695 --> 01:14:25,201
what difference would it make?

1110
01:14:28,119 --> 01:14:30,287
This is what love is like.

1111
01:15:31,418 --> 01:15:33,594
"Energy creates energy,"

1112
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:35,311
Sarah Bernhardt said.

1113
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:39,739
"It is by spending myself
that I become rich."

1114
01:16:50,684 --> 01:16:52,973
So it's like
rivulets in a lake.

1115
01:16:53,076 --> 01:16:55,538
Where you throw a stone
and these lamps...

1116
01:16:58,085 --> 01:16:59,495
Please tell me again, Mr. Tesla,

1117
01:16:59,529 --> 01:17:01,938
the distance between your
machines and these lamps.

1118
01:17:01,972 --> 01:17:03,384
26 miles.

1119
01:17:04,005 --> 01:17:05,969
It would be simple

1120
01:17:06,901 --> 01:17:10,948
to take a common 300
horsepower oscillator

1121
01:17:10,982 --> 01:17:14,763
to run simultaneously
operations just like this one

1122
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,498
at any point on the globe.

1123
01:17:17,312 --> 01:17:20,945
One need only place the receiving
apparatus into the ground.

1124
01:17:20,979 --> 01:17:22,645
Doesn't matter if the
transmission is affected

1125
01:17:22,715 --> 01:17:23,582
at a few miles

1126
01:17:23,693 --> 01:17:26,040
or a few thousand miles.

1127
01:17:26,673 --> 01:17:29,159
The waves travel
in all directions,

1128
01:17:29,252 --> 01:17:32,724
passing over the earth's
bulge in ever smaller circles

1129
01:17:32,817 --> 01:17:35,688
in increasing intensity
until they converge

1130
01:17:35,749 --> 01:17:37,722
on the planet's opposite side.

1131
01:17:38,685 --> 01:17:41,371
So transmitting messages to a

1132
01:17:41,554 --> 01:17:44,108
receiving terminal,
if I understand you,

1133
01:17:44,167 --> 01:17:46,935
you can signal
steam ships at sea,

1134
01:17:46,968 --> 01:17:49,704
obtain instantaneous stock
quotes from the stock exchange,

1135
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:50,906
New York Stock Exchange

1136
01:17:50,939 --> 01:17:52,941
if you set up a tower
on the east coast

1137
01:17:52,974 --> 01:17:55,610
and another one on the
other side of the Atlantic?

1138
01:17:55,644 --> 01:17:56,478
Yes.

1139
01:17:58,328 --> 01:18:01,131
How much you estimate you
need to make this a reality?

1140
01:18:07,489 --> 01:18:10,358
Let's be honest, I don't have
a very good impression of you.

1141
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:12,314
You talk, you're boastful.

1142
01:18:13,249 --> 01:18:14,829
And apart from the
deal with Westinghouse,

1143
01:18:14,863 --> 01:18:17,032
you've yet to make much
money off of your boasts.

1144
01:18:17,122 --> 01:18:21,570
But contrary to popular
belief, I never did a thing

1145
01:18:21,603 --> 01:18:24,207
except buying and selling
securities of foreign exchange

1146
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,966
simply to make money
from the doing of it.

1147
01:18:35,034 --> 01:18:36,545
$100,000?

1148
01:18:36,618 --> 01:18:37,552
That be sufficient?

1149
01:18:39,497 --> 01:18:40,932
Yes.

1150
01:18:40,989 --> 01:18:42,791
I think you're wrong.

1151
01:18:42,824 --> 01:18:45,393
I understand what you're up
to here and you can do more.

1152
01:18:47,395 --> 01:18:49,412
We'll draw up a
contract, of course.

1153
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:54,246
You and I have much in common.

1154
01:18:55,437 --> 01:18:56,905
I believe in higher reality,

1155
01:18:58,642 --> 01:19:00,976
I believe in recklessness
of great men.

1156
01:19:02,278 --> 01:19:03,979
Following the
battle of the currents,

1157
01:19:04,107 --> 01:19:07,115
Thomas Edison abandons
his idea of electricity.

1158
01:19:07,237 --> 01:19:08,984
He's done with it, he says,

1159
01:19:09,096 --> 01:19:10,852
and throws himself
at his new method

1160
01:19:10,886 --> 01:19:14,122
of extracting low grade
iron ore from crushed rocks.

1161
01:19:14,203 --> 01:19:16,625
He buys land in
Ogdensburg, New Jersey

1162
01:19:16,717 --> 01:19:21,096
and sets up a vast operation,
employing over 400 men.

1163
01:19:21,186 --> 01:19:24,432
By 1899, while Tesla's
in Colorado Springs,

1164
01:19:25,116 --> 01:19:28,069
the Edison mining concern is
declared a complete failure,

1165
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:29,704
wiping our four million dollars

1166
01:19:29,738 --> 01:19:31,539
of Edison's personal fortune.

1167
01:19:40,488 --> 01:19:42,590
Yeah, it's all gone.

1168
01:19:42,693 --> 01:19:45,315
But we had a hell of a
good time spending it.

1169
01:19:47,972 --> 01:19:50,473
As his mother would
say, he tried to eat something

1170
01:19:50,525 --> 01:19:51,913
bigger than his head.

1171
01:20:19,322 --> 01:20:21,746
Miss Morgan, I believe
I've been remiss.

1172
01:20:22,891 --> 01:20:23,951
What does that mean?

1173
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,088
Remiss.

1174
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,190
That's one of those

1175
01:20:28,224 --> 01:20:30,492
words I never
really know what...

1176
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:41,772
Yes, Marconi sends his
signal through the air

1177
01:20:42,766 --> 01:20:47,096
using 17 of my patents.

1178
01:20:48,453 --> 01:20:53,159
When our tower is complete,
we will send our message

1179
01:20:53,255 --> 01:20:55,767
across the earth
through the earth.

1180
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,156
He sent it across the Channel

1181
01:21:00,292 --> 01:21:02,127
and no one's done that before.

1182
01:21:02,878 --> 01:21:03,965
You haven't done that.

1183
01:21:03,999 --> 01:21:07,969
Using 17 of my patents.

1184
01:21:08,003 --> 01:21:08,870
Hello, Anne.

1185
01:21:10,005 --> 01:21:11,259
I've just made tea.

1186
01:21:15,311 --> 01:21:18,580
I understand your father
left for Cairo last week.

1187
01:21:18,613 --> 01:21:21,150
His aides say he can't be
reached for another two weeks.

1188
01:21:21,196 --> 01:21:24,253
When this tower is complete,

1189
01:21:24,434 --> 01:21:27,361
he will be able to be
reached in an instant.

1190
01:21:30,071 --> 01:21:33,074
I'm not here to talk
for him or about him.

1191
01:21:34,882 --> 01:21:36,089
Except to tell you

1192
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:38,400
that he knows you're in debt.

1193
01:21:38,503 --> 01:21:39,509
Of
course he's in debt.

1194
01:21:39,543 --> 01:21:41,149
He's revolutionizing at
least three fields of...

1195
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,414
Deep debt.

1196
01:21:44,168 --> 01:21:45,804
And when you send out
distress signals...

1197
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:47,271
Do you understand
the scale of what he's...

1198
01:21:47,305 --> 01:21:49,778
It can only
alarm any other investors,

1199
01:21:49,811 --> 01:21:51,616
if any are left to be alarmed.

1200
01:21:52,881 --> 01:21:54,450
And all my father
asked for was a way

1201
01:21:54,483 --> 01:21:56,844
to send stock reports
across the Atlantic.

1202
01:21:58,743 --> 01:22:01,582
We don't have any
other investors.

1203
01:22:01,686 --> 01:22:02,888
Why would you?

1204
01:22:03,259 --> 01:22:05,868
My father has a 51%
share of your patents.

1205
01:22:13,436 --> 01:22:15,103
I'm wondering why
you're giving interviews

1206
01:22:15,137 --> 01:22:17,506
about getting
messages from Mars.

1207
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,718
I had three

1208
01:22:19,542 --> 01:22:20,750
signals,

1209
01:22:21,473 --> 01:22:24,603
distinct vibrations,
even, not random.

1210
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,377
I do believe it
pretends a message.

1211
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:30,785
Why would you go
on record with this?

1212
01:22:31,329 --> 01:22:32,620
I said it pretends...

1213
01:22:32,654 --> 01:22:34,055
From Mars?

1214
01:22:34,089 --> 01:22:36,192
My father reads these things.

1215
01:22:36,225 --> 01:22:38,127
You believe in martians?

1216
01:22:38,275 --> 01:22:39,428
The chance of alien
life is actually...

1217
01:22:39,462 --> 01:22:41,564
Alien life

1218
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:44,605
is a statistical certainty.

1219
01:22:51,106 --> 01:22:53,410
What if you're picking
up Marconi's signals?

1220
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:57,181
His test signals from
across the English Channel.

1221
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:59,541
Not Mars, but Marconi?

1222
01:23:02,218 --> 01:23:05,787
I believe that I may be

1223
01:23:06,798 --> 01:23:08,141
the first person

1224
01:23:08,921 --> 01:23:13,775
who has ever heard the sound
of one planet greeting another.

1225
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,336
What happens if
your system succeeds?

1226
01:23:20,415 --> 01:23:22,350
Who controls the
distribution of power?

1227
01:23:23,305 --> 01:23:24,825
Nobody controls it.

1228
01:23:25,503 --> 01:23:26,573
Like air, right?

1229
01:23:28,355 --> 01:23:30,678
You can't break it
into saleable units

1230
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:31,980
available to everyone.

1231
01:23:32,075 --> 01:23:32,909
That's right.

1232
01:23:36,426 --> 01:23:38,487
Doesn't it occur to you
that the way the world runs

1233
01:23:38,521 --> 01:23:40,989
is determined by the
manipulation of all this?

1234
01:23:43,124 --> 01:23:45,721
Power, energy.

1235
01:23:47,809 --> 01:23:49,512
And what you wanna do is...

1236
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:57,055
What do you want to do?

1237
01:23:58,564 --> 01:24:00,566
When this system is complete,

1238
01:24:01,782 --> 01:24:05,112
we will be able
to go to a swamp,

1239
01:24:05,677 --> 01:24:09,447
or a desert, some place
broken, and plighted.

1240
01:24:09,964 --> 01:24:12,387
Places small, sea for a few,

1241
01:24:12,507 --> 01:24:17,159
simple machines and
have light, heat,

1242
01:24:17,255 --> 01:24:21,696
mode of power, a complete
system of communication

1243
01:24:21,827 --> 01:24:24,366
for a people
previously living under

1244
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,866
the most wretched
of circumstances.

1245
01:24:27,718 --> 01:24:28,552
And

1246
01:24:31,705 --> 01:24:34,040
we will be able
to do it cheaply.

1247
01:24:39,148 --> 01:24:40,735
You are not an economist.

1248
01:24:42,947 --> 01:24:44,481
Everything has to be paid for.

1249
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,377
Especially money.

1250
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:58,766
The 150,000 my
father gives Tesla

1251
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,136
in December, 1901,

1252
01:25:01,256 --> 01:25:03,558
equivalent of four
million in today's money,

1253
01:25:04,422 --> 01:25:07,510
is the same amount he paid
for this painting in April.

1254
01:25:11,234 --> 01:25:12,235
Though this

1255
01:25:14,015 --> 01:25:16,352
is my favorite painting
he bought at this time.

1256
01:25:17,927 --> 01:25:19,757
Remere,

1257
01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:21,429
another 100,000.

1258
01:25:25,627 --> 01:25:28,997
During the same period,
working day and night,

1259
01:25:29,128 --> 01:25:32,468
Pierpont organizes the
creation of U.S. Steel,

1260
01:25:32,633 --> 01:25:35,336
the first company valued
at a billion dollars.

1261
01:25:41,908 --> 01:25:44,808
Since a
year, Mr. Morgan,

1262
01:25:45,714 --> 01:25:48,384
there has been hardly a night

1263
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:52,721
when my pillow has not
been bathed in tears,

1264
01:25:52,843 --> 01:25:56,372
but you must not think
me a weak man for that.

1265
01:25:57,017 --> 01:26:01,340
When while this is applied,
the earth will be converted

1266
01:26:01,374 --> 01:26:05,706
into a huge brain,
capable of response

1267
01:26:05,792 --> 01:26:09,204
in every one of it parts.

1268
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:11,839
Its principles I have discovered

1269
01:26:11,931 --> 01:26:15,277
will cause a revolution so great

1270
01:26:15,311 --> 01:26:20,512
that almost all values
and all human relations

1271
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:23,386
will be profoundly modified.

1272
01:26:24,684 --> 01:26:27,352
My patents confer a monopoly.

1273
01:27:36,597 --> 01:27:38,122
Ah, Mr. Tesla.

1274
01:27:40,473 --> 01:27:43,443
I understand your ship has
run up against the rocks.

1275
01:27:44,173 --> 01:27:45,099
Great pity.

1276
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:46,106
Mr. Morgan.

1277
01:27:48,207 --> 01:27:50,408
There isn't a single person
that's come to visit me

1278
01:27:50,491 --> 01:27:53,173
in the last 30 years
who's come for any purpose

1279
01:27:53,255 --> 01:27:55,792
other than to grovel on
the carpet for money.

1280
01:27:56,712 --> 01:27:59,609
I've sent you detailed
telegraphs, facts.

1281
01:27:59,866 --> 01:28:01,667
I'm not a vagabond come to beg.

1282
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:05,429
Last year I provided
you with $100,000.

1283
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:09,462
Months later, you requested
additional aid, $50,000 more.

1284
01:28:09,496 --> 01:28:11,299
Do you think I'm
a bottomless pit?

1285
01:28:11,899 --> 01:28:15,517
When my work is finished,
you'll recoup your investment

1286
01:28:15,551 --> 01:28:16,988
tenfold, a hundredfold.

1287
01:28:17,071 --> 01:28:19,374
I'm not convinced you
will finish your work.

1288
01:28:20,861 --> 01:28:22,796
Anyway, I'm in no need of money.

1289
01:28:24,668 --> 01:28:25,469
Ball.

1290
01:28:26,775 --> 01:28:29,041
I'm working on a new method

1291
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:30,804
to photograph thought,

1292
01:28:32,506 --> 01:28:35,709
transcribing electric
impulses from the brain.

1293
01:28:38,155 --> 01:28:40,459
The Ottawa Indians
considered the Milky Way

1294
01:28:40,547 --> 01:28:43,584
to be muddy water
stirred by a turtle

1295
01:28:43,617 --> 01:28:46,453
swimming along the
bottom of the sky.

1296
01:28:47,754 --> 01:28:50,457
What do you think of that?

1297
01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:54,125
There is nothing durable but
the eternal state of things.

1298
01:28:55,829 --> 01:28:58,565
Do not let yourself
be intimidated

1299
01:28:58,677 --> 01:29:00,237
by the horror of the world.

1300
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:03,437
Everything's ordered and
correct and must fulfill

1301
01:29:03,494 --> 01:29:06,585
its destiny in order
to retain perfection.

1302
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:13,467
Soon I will be able to release

1303
01:29:13,951 --> 01:29:17,050
a new series of inventions

1304
01:29:17,146 --> 01:29:19,581
that will make
warfare unthinkable.

1305
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:25,058
The central idea is a being

1306
01:29:25,092 --> 01:29:28,127
of some microscopic particles
traveling at a speed

1307
01:29:28,222 --> 01:29:30,659
close to that of
the speed of light.

1308
01:29:31,697 --> 01:29:34,567
It will stop an
army in its tracks

1309
01:29:34,601 --> 01:29:38,005
at 250 miles, swipe a
squadron of airplanes

1310
01:29:38,038 --> 01:29:39,539
at an even greater distance.

1311
01:29:48,749 --> 01:29:51,485
Beam travels in a straight
line trajectory and therefore

1312
01:29:51,518 --> 01:29:55,322
has range limitations by
the curvature of the earth

1313
01:29:55,355 --> 01:29:58,996
and all the essential details
aren't finished in my mind.

Do you remember my
face when I realized

1334
01:33:43,712 --> 01:33:45,342
it was hopeless between us?

1335
01:33:47,414 --> 01:33:49,839
Or does everything get
jumbled in your head?

1336
01:33:53,122 --> 01:33:55,758
On a sequence of numbers,

1337
01:33:56,129 --> 01:33:58,832
but a blur of
images, impressions,

1338
01:33:59,782 --> 01:34:00,616
feelings.

1339
01:34:01,866 --> 01:34:03,601
The way most of us
remember things.

1340
01:34:15,079 --> 01:34:19,484
I finally met someone,
someone as strong and willful

1341
01:34:19,619 --> 01:34:21,421
as my father,

1342
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:23,693
someone who wanted me.

1343
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,380
S. E. Marbury.

1344
01:34:30,245 --> 01:34:33,347
I moved into her villa
in the French countryside

1345
01:34:33,466 --> 01:34:35,902
and we poured American
money into a relief fund

1346
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:38,872
during the war,
a health service,

1347
01:34:38,905 --> 01:34:40,245
a camp for children.

1348
01:34:47,826 --> 01:34:51,429
Nikola Tesla outlives
Edison, Westinghouse,

1349
01:34:51,518 --> 01:34:55,185
Sarah Bernhardt, and my father

1350
01:34:55,271 --> 01:34:57,791
and dies alone at
the Hotel New Yorker

1351
01:34:57,824 --> 01:35:00,629
on January 7th, 1943.

1352
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:03,258
He was 87 years old.

1353
01:35:03,863 --> 01:35:06,114
Destitute but not forgotten.

1354
01:35:06,688 --> 01:35:09,254
Over 2,000 people
attend his funeral

1355
01:35:09,538 --> 01:35:11,678
at the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine.

1356
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:17,138
He was always looking ahead,

1357
01:35:17,923 --> 01:35:20,046
projecting himself
into the future.

1358
01:35:21,973 --> 01:35:24,476
Maybe he promised more
than he could deliver,

1359
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:26,750
maybe he overreached,

1360
01:35:28,006 --> 01:35:30,008
or maybe the world
that we are living in

1361
01:35:30,636 --> 01:35:33,660
is a dream that
Tesla dreamed first.

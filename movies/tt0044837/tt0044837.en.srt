2
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:40,059
Mrs. Alsop's out!

3
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,354
Mrs. Alsop's out!

4
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,119
- Did you turn off the gas?
- What gas?

5
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:35,249
- Which is her room?
- Er, this one.

6
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,814
We must move her.
Where's the landlady?

7
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,357
- Not home.
- Where's your room?

8
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:51,610
Two floors up.

9
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,323
Take her shoulders,
I'll take her feet.

10
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:56,744
Come on, Miss.

11
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:07,261
Pick up my bag.

12
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,182
Sorry,
you'll have to do that yourself.

13
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,871
Open the windows.
She needs lots of fresh air.

14
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:25,540
So do I.

15
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,389
- Shall I call an ambulance?
- No time.

16
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:37,435
She needs an emetic first.
Glass of water, please.

17
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,607
Here it is.

18
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,365
I need 2 quarts of warm water
and some towels.

19
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:47,452
Towels, coming up.

20
00:06:58,096 --> 00:07:00,182
You found this bottle
clutched in her hand?

21
00:07:00,474 --> 00:07:02,894
Certainly did, from your dispensary.

22
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:06,442
I see.
How long have you known this girl?

23
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,612
About five minutes.

24
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:11,868
She'll need looking after
for a couple of days.

25
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:15,415
- How about the ambulance?
- It isn't necessary now.

26
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:17,711
She's out of danger.

27
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:21,758
Besides, sending her to a hospital
would start an inquiry.

28
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:24,680
And attempted suicide means jail.

29
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:28,020
However, in a couple of days
she'll be fully recovered.

30
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:30,315
Meanwhile, let her rest quietly.

31
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:32,944
If she's thirsty
give her orange juice.

32
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,031
And tomorrow,
if she has an appetite

33
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:37,619
a little chicken broth,
but no tinned food.

34
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:40,957
Now, if you'll be at my dispensary
in ten minutes

35
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,543
I'll have a prescription for you.

36
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:45,757
- For me?
- No. For her, of course.

37
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:16,140
Headache?

38
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:18,437
Where am I?

39
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,440
In my room.
I live two floors above you.

40
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:23,528
What happened?

41
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:27,493
I came home this evening and
smelled gas coming from your room

42
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:29,163
so I broke in the door,
called a doctor,

43
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,458
and together we brought you here.

44
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:34,171
Why didn't you let me die?

45
00:08:34,588 --> 00:08:35,757
What's your hurry?

46
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,470
Are you in pain?

47
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:45,565
That's all that matters.
The rest is fantasy.

48
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:49,947
Billions of years it's taken
to evolve human consciousness

49
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,825
and you want to wipe it out.

50
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:55,247
Wipe out the miracle
of all existence.

51
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:59,128
More important than anything
in the whole universe!

52
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:01,424
What can the stars do?

53
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:04,972
Nothing...
but sit on their axis!

54
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:09,562
And the sun,

55
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:13,320
shooting flames 280,000 miles high...

56
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,280
So what?

57
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:19,162
Wasting all its natural resources.

58
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:23,127
Can the sun think? Is it conscious?

59
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:25,213
No, but you are!

60
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:30,514
Pardon me, my mistake.

61
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:45,956
Here you are, and there you go!

62
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,464
Well, bless me. Heavens alive!

63
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,385
Look at that. Look at me door!

64
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,973
House breaking, that's what it is!

65
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:59,020
I suppose she's taken her things.
She'll go to jail for this.

66
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,523
I knew she was no good.

67
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:04,320
That quiet type.

68
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:07,158
Still waters that run deep
usually stink!

69
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:18,844
That's funny,
she hasn't taken a thing.

70
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,722
And she won't, either.

71
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:23,434
Not until she's paid 4 weeks rent.

72
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:24,980
Smashing in a door!

73
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:28,235
Nice festivities
going on behind my back!

74
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:31,240
Well, she's out now
and she'll stay out!

75
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,517
Mr. Calvero! Oh Mr. Calvero!

76
00:11:24,662 --> 00:11:27,082
Is that you, Mr. Calvero?

77
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,838
Your laundry.
I was about to leave it on your bed.

78
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:32,717
Just a moment!

79
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:40,521
Hold it, hold it!

80
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:42,400
Hold everything!

81
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:57,132
You dropped these.

82
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:01,598
And here's your oranges.

83
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:03,684
Thank you.

84
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,143
So this is
how she spends her evenings.

85
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:32,190
You take your hands off me!

86
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,943
What's she doing in your room?

87
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,529
The opposite of what you think.

88
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:38,534
I'd like to know
who smashed in the door downstairs.

89
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:40,329
- I did.
- You did!

90
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:41,789
You have a leaking gas pipe.

91
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:42,917
I have a what?

92
00:12:43,668 --> 00:12:45,545
I mean that room
has a leaking gas pipe.

93
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:47,841
There's something fishy about this.

94
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,554
- Who is she anyway?
- You ought to know by now.

95
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:53,559
Came six weeks ago.
Said she was a working girl.

96
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:56,481
That's what they all say.
Why are you so interested?

97
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,776
The girl tried to kill herself.

98
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:02,449
Took poison, turned on the gas.
I came home just in time.

99
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:05,246
I'll call the police
and get an ambulance.

100
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:08,083
It'll be in all the papers.
You don't want that.

101
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:09,961
She's not staying where she is.

102
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:14,136
My good woman, I don't want her!
Let her go back to her room.

103
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:16,513
I should say not.
Besides, it's rented.

104
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:18,809
You can't throw her into the street!

105
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:21,522
She's not going back
to her own room.

106
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,192
Then she'll have to stay
where she is.

107
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,820
What? And scandalize my household!

108
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,826
We could be man and wife
for all anyone knows.

109
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:31,956
Oh, could you?
Well, you'd better not be.

110
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:34,377
You'd better get rid of her,
and quick.

111
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:36,130
Man and wife!

112
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:38,133
You watch out for that hussy.

113
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:42,181
She's no good. And she's been sick
since she came here.

114
00:13:45,938 --> 00:13:48,024
It wouldn't be dandruff, would it?

115
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:54,483
Ready?

116
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:57,839
<i>I am an animal trainer</i>

117
00:16:58,048 --> 00:16:59,925
<i>A circus entertainer</i>

118
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:03,682
<i>I train animals by the score
Lions, tigers and wild boar</i>

119
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:07,438
<i>I've made and lost a fortune
In my wild career</i>

120
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:11,612
<i>Some say the cause was women
Some say it was beer</i>

121
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,247
<i>Then I went through bankruptcy
And lost my whole menagerie</i>

122
00:17:17,455 --> 00:17:20,794
<i>But I did not despair
I got a bright idea</i>

123
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:22,755
<i>While searching
through my underwear</i>

124
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:24,633
<i>A thought occurred to me</i>

125
00:17:24,842 --> 00:17:29,140
<i>I'm tired of training elephants
So why not train a flea</i>

126
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:34,358
<i>Why should I hunt for animals
And through the jungle roam</i>

127
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:38,615
<i>When there's local talent
to be found right here at home</i>

128
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,914
<i>I found one but I won't say where</i>

129
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:46,043
<i>And educated him with care</i>

130
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:48,839
<i>And taught him
all the facts of life</i>

131
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,762
<i>And then he found himself a wife</i>

132
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,683
<i>I give them board and lodging free</i>

133
00:17:54,892 --> 00:17:57,521
<i>And every night they dine off me</i>

134
00:17:57,731 --> 00:18:00,234
<i>They don't eat caviar or cake</i>

135
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:03,031
<i>But they enjoy a good rump steak</i>

136
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,912
<i>Off my anatomy
Off my anatomy</i>

137
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,082
<i>It is an odd sensation</i>

138
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:13,673
<i>When after meals they take a stroll
Around the old plantation</i>

139
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,429
<i>Now I'm as happy as can be</i>

140
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,475
<i>I've taught them lots of tricks
you see</i>

141
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:24,649
<i>And now they're both supporting me
They're both supporting me</i>

142
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:29,950
<i>So walk up, walk up
I've the greatest show on earth</i>

143
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:34,040
<i>Walk up, walk up
And get your money's worth</i>

144
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:37,796
<i>See Phyllis and Henry
Those educated fleas</i>

145
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:41,427
<i>Cavorting and sporting
On the flying trapeze</i>

146
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:45,101
<i>So any time you itch
Don't scratch or make a fuss</i>

147
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:49,064
<i>You never can tell you might destroy
Some budding genius</i>

148
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,515
Phyllis! Henry! Stop that!

149
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,185
What do you think you're doing?

150
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,442
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves, fighting like that!

151
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:19,324
Alright. Phyllis, stay in the box!
Henry!

152
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,560
You should have done that
before I opened the box.

153
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:03,438
Do you hear? Come on!

154
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:24,222
Do you want me to squeeze?

155
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,825
Stop that now!

156
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:03,329
Come up from there!

157
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:06,459
Phyllis, you hear?
Remember you're on a diet.

158
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:10,550
Phyllis, have you gone mad?

159
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:16,184
Stop that, do you hear? Stop it!

160
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:22,945
Phyllis, do you hear?
Come up at once! You go too far!

161
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:26,284
Phyllis, what are you doing?

162
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,831
Crazy little creature!

163
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,669
Phyllis, Henry wants you.

164
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:34,757
Come, Phyllis.

165
00:21:35,382 --> 00:21:36,634
Phyllis, stop that.

166
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:44,356
Phyllis, come out here!
Come out!

167
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:47,277
Where do you think you're going?
You nitwit!

168
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:50,198
Phyllis! Stop that now!

169
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:53,745
Do you want me to scratch?

170
00:21:59,673 --> 00:22:01,467
That's not Phyllis.

171
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:03,972
Where's Phyllis?

172
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,849
Oh, there she is!

173
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:25,291
Are you awake?

174
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,420
Your husband said to look in on you.

175
00:23:31,547 --> 00:23:34,049
- Who?
- Your husband.

176
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:36,968
He said to warm up
some chicken soup for you.

177
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,054
Husband?

178
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:42,098
Let me help you. Come on.

179
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:44,808
You haven't eaten a thing all day.

180
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:46,978
A nice warm soup will do you good.

181
00:23:47,187 --> 00:23:48,354
Thank you, no.

182
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,533
Your wife won't eat.

183
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:03,578
Well, that's a blessing
to a poor married man.

184
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:18,592
How do you feel?

185
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:21,511
Much better, thank you.

186
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,055
Good.

187
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:25,266
Pay no attention
to this wife business.

188
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:28,894
It's a front of respectability
for the new housemaid.

189
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:34,524
However, as soon as you get well
you'll be free and divorced.

190
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,318
I think I'm well enough now.

191
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:40,572
Not quite. I think
you'd better stay another day or so.

192
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:42,574
You're very kind.

193
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:45,494
I think I'm able to get back
to my room now.

194
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:49,455
I'm afraid that isn't possible.

195
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:51,540
Why?

196
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,877
Mrs. Alsop's rented it.
The people are moving in today.

197
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:57,797
Oh, I see.

198
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,427
However you're welcome to stay here
until you know what you want to do.

199
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:06,138
What can I do? I'm helpless.

200
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:13,854
Why didn't you let me die
and get it over with!

201
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:17,482
That's no way to talk. You're alive
and you better make the most of it.

202
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:19,777
I'm destitute. Ill.

203
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:21,361
Listen...

204
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,573
I don't know what's wrong with you,

205
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:28,661
but if you're ill,
and if it's what Mrs. Alsop thinks,

206
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:31,788
you should do something about it.
It isn't hopeless.

207
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,539
If it's, uh...

208
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:36,877
You know what I'm talking about.

209
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:38,878
I don't think I do.

210
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:41,673
Well, let me put it this way.

211
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:45,760
A young girl, alone,
thrown into the world, gets ill.

212
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:49,096
If it's anything like that,
you can be cured.

213
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:53,268
There's a new drug performing
miracles, curing thousands.

214
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:56,604
If it's anything of that nature
don't be afraid to tell,

215
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:58,271
maybe I can help.

216
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:01,066
I'm an old sinner,
nothing shocks me.

217
00:26:04,612 --> 00:26:06,071
It's nothing like that.

218
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:07,948
Are you sure?

219
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:09,741
Positive.

220
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:11,409
But you have been ill?

221
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:15,788
Yes. I was five months
in the hospital with rheumatic fever.

222
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,709
Is that all?
Then what are you complaining about?

223
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:20,877
It's ruined my health.
I can't work.

224
00:26:21,085 --> 00:26:22,254
What do you work at?

225
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:24,338
I was a dancer.

226
00:26:25,674 --> 00:26:26,841
A dancer!

227
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,801
A member of the Empire ballet.

228
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:32,763
And I thought you were a...

229
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:35,599
So, you're a ballet dancer.

230
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:39,562
Pardon me, we haven't met formally.
What is your name?

231
00:26:40,187 --> 00:26:43,399
Thereza Ambrose.
But I'm called Terry.

232
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:47,778
Charming. How do you do.
I'm also in the business.

233
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:50,489
My name is Calvero.
Perhaps you've heard of me.

234
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:52,992
You're not the great comedian?

235
00:26:53,618 --> 00:26:56,537
I was.
However, we won't go into that.

236
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:59,581
Whatever brought you
to this state of affairs?

237
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:01,041
Ill health, mostly.

238
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,835
Then we'll have to get you well.

239
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,173
It isn't the ideal spot
for convalescing,

240
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:10,009
but you're welcome to it,

241
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,053
if you can put up with being
Mrs. Calvero. In name only!

242
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:16,055
It won't inconvenience you?

243
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:18,766
Not at all.
I've had five wives already.

244
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:20,726
One more or less
makes no difference.

245
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:22,729
Moreover, I've arrived at the age

246
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:27,192
where platonic friendship can be
sustained on the highest moral plane.

247
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:37,951
Now let me see, your mother was
a dressmaker and your father a lord?

248
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,662
The fourth son of a lord.
That's quite different.

249
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:44,834
How is it he married your mother?

250
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:46,919
She was
one of the family housemaids.

251
00:27:47,754 --> 00:27:49,629
Sounds like a novelette.

252
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,050
- Did he have any money?
- No, the family cut him off.

253
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,885
So your sister's
the only one living?

254
00:27:56,304 --> 00:27:58,179
Yes, and she's in South America.

255
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,227
Tell me, was it just ill health
that made you do what you did?

256
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:07,356
- That, and...
- And what?

257
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:12,235
The utter futility of everything.

258
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:15,904
I see it even in flowers,

259
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:18,699
hear it in music.

260
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:21,619
All life aimless,
without meaning.

261
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:24,455
What do you want a meaning for?

262
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,457
Life is a desire, not a meaning.

263
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:30,378
Desire is the theme of all life!

264
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:34,756
It makes a rose want to be a rose,
and want to grow like that.

265
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:38,844
And a rock want to contain itself
and remain like that.

266
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,640
What are you smiling about?

267
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,226
Your imitation
of a rose and a rock.

268
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,187
I can imitate anything.

269
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:53,859
Ever seen a Japanese tree?
They're lopsided, they grow this way.

270
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,990
Of course pansies grow this way.

271
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:04,077
The dark ones frown and go like that.

272
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,125
However, the meaning of anything

273
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,043
is merely other words
for the same thing.

274
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:17,298
After all, a rose is a rose.
Not bad, should be quoted.

275
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,678
Think how meaningless
life was a moment ago.

276
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:27,434
Now you have
a temporary husband and a home.

277
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:32,855
Here's your drinking water,
and in case of any emergencies,

278
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:36,608
the first door on the left,
the same on each floor.

279
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:39,945
Good night.

280
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,036
<i>Spring is here!</i>

281
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:34,789
<i>Birds are calling</i>

282
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:38,542
<i>Skunks are crawling</i>

283
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:43,339
<i>Wagging their tails for love</i>

284
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:47,176
<i>Spring is here!</i>

285
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:50,638
<i>Whales are churning</i>

286
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,268
<i>Worms are squirming</i>

287
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:59,063
<i>Wagging their tails for love</i>

288
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:02,816
<i>What is this thing
Of which I sing</i>

289
00:31:03,026 --> 00:31:04,818
<i>That makes us all bewitched?</i>

290
00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:08,029
<i>What is this thing
That comes in Spring</i>

291
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,323
<i>That gives us all the itch?</i>

292
00:31:12,326 --> 00:31:13,994
<i>Oh, it's love</i>

293
00:31:14,203 --> 00:31:16,788
<i>It's love,
It's love love love love</i>

294
00:31:58,412 --> 00:32:00,705
Pardon me,
but have you a fly swatter?

295
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:03,208
I beg your pardon.

296
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,919
If you beg around here,
I'll call the police.

297
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:08,005
I repeat, I beg your pardon.

298
00:32:08,297 --> 00:32:09,673
I don't care what you've eaten.

299
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:10,799
I've eaten nothing.

300
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,218
Poor dear.
Here, get a sandwich.

301
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:16,221
- Sir, I demand an apology!
- I don't know you.

302
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,640
Who are your people?
Are you in the social register?

303
00:32:18,932 --> 00:32:22,185
- My name happens to be Smith.
- Never heard of them.

304
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:24,478
That shows you're asinine.

305
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:26,230
I should have worn my overcoat.

306
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,441
You've interrupted me
in the middle of my sonnet.

307
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:29,901
In the middle of your what?

308
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:32,404
Not in the middle of my what,
the middle of my sonnet.

309
00:32:32,904 --> 00:32:34,572
My ode to a worm.

310
00:32:35,949 --> 00:32:39,160
Oh worm, why do you turn
into the earth from me?

311
00:32:39,368 --> 00:32:40,828
'Tis Spring! Oh worm!

312
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:42,622
Lift up your head

313
00:32:42,913 --> 00:32:45,750
whichever end that be
and smile at the sun

314
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:49,086
untwine your naked form
and with your tail, fling!

315
00:32:49,295 --> 00:32:50,963
High the dirt in ecstasy!

316
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:55,342
'Tis Spring! 'Tis Spring!
'Tis Spring!

317
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:00,429
Ridiculous!
A worm smiling at the sun!

318
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:03,057
- Why not?
- A worm can't smile.

319
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:05,143
Did you ever appeal
to its sense of humor?

320
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:06,602
- Of course not.
- Well then!

321
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:08,772
But it doesn't make sense.

322
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:11,815
Why should poetry
have to make sense?

323
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:15,361
Don't you know there's such a thing
as poetic license?

324
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:17,655
I've given you no license.

325
00:33:17,947 --> 00:33:19,115
Oh no, don't!

326
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:21,702
This thing is so much bigger
than ourselves!

327
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,371
At this moment
I'm grasping the meaning of life.

328
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,956
What a waste of energy.

329
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:31,711
What is this urge
that makes life go on and on?

330
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:35,172
You're right.
What does it all mean?

331
00:33:35,674 --> 00:33:36,841
Where are we going?

332
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,551
You're going south.
Your hand's in my pocket.

333
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:41,219
Naughty.

334
00:33:41,512 --> 00:33:45,474
- How did it get there?
- Pure magnetism, old dear.

335
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,147
Why are you antagonistic
towards me?

336
00:33:52,356 --> 00:33:54,024
Must we be serious?

337
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,109
You make it difficult to know you.

338
00:33:56,318 --> 00:33:57,986
Read my memoirs
in the Police Gazette.

339
00:33:58,194 --> 00:34:00,613
- You're a funny man.
- Why?

340
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,908
To talk about worms
the way you do.

341
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:06,329
Why not? Even flies are romantic.

342
00:34:06,537 --> 00:34:08,329
- Flies?
- Oh yes.

343
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:10,832
Coming from the stable
to the table,

344
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:15,086
chasing each other over the sugar
and meeting in the butter.

345
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:18,131
- You've read "The Life of the Bee"?
- No, I haven't.

346
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,342
The bee's behavior in the beehive
is unbelievable.

347
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:23,011
Really?

348
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,430
- Gezundheit!
- It certainly does.

349
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:28,433
- I beg your pardon?
- The dress. It goes on tight.

350
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:32,186
You're awful dusty tonight, my dear.
Turn around.

351
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:35,730
Where do they keep you?
On the top shelf or something?

352
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:41,069
Fuller's earth? Johnson's powder?
I know! Cornstarch.

353
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:45,323
Just think!
All life motivated by love.

354
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:46,701
How beautiful.

355
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,452
- By no means beautiful.
- It certainly is.

356
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:52,122
No, it's vile, wicked, awful!
But wonderful.

357
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:54,416
- I like you.
- Really?

358
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,918
You're sensitive. You feel things.

359
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:58,378
Don't encourage me.

360
00:34:58,587 --> 00:35:02,841
It's true. So few people
have the capacity to feel.

361
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,634
Or the opportunity.

362
00:35:08,388 --> 00:35:09,430
Allow me.

363
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,225
Use it only for what you wish.

364
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:40,294
Come in.

365
00:35:43,297 --> 00:35:45,298
Good morning. How do you feel?

366
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:47,259
- Better, thank you.
- Good.

367
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:49,136
What a day!

368
00:35:49,552 --> 00:35:53,222
The sun's shining, the kettle's
singing, and we've paid the rent.

369
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:56,976
There'll be an earthquake,
I know it.

370
00:35:58,436 --> 00:35:59,979
What would you like for breakfast?

371
00:36:00,188 --> 00:36:03,941
We have eggs, bacon,
cheese, spring onions...

372
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:06,570
That's broken my dream!

373
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:09,779
I dreamt we did an act together,
all about Spring.

374
00:36:09,988 --> 00:36:10,948
Interesting.

375
00:36:11,158 --> 00:36:14,577
I get lots of ideas in my dreams,
then I wake up and forget them.

376
00:36:15,412 --> 00:36:19,164
You know, I've been dreaming a lot
about the theater lately.

377
00:36:19,373 --> 00:36:21,583
Doing my old acts all over again.

378
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:27,631
Kippers. Aren't they superb!

379
00:36:32,094 --> 00:36:33,136
What's wrong?

380
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:38,890
It's my legs! I tried to get up
this morning and I collapsed.

381
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:40,768
I can't even stand.

382
00:36:41,812 --> 00:36:43,062
You got up too soon.

383
00:36:43,354 --> 00:36:46,899
No, it's not that.
I have no feeling in them.

384
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:50,235
They're paralyzed. I know it!

385
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:53,906
Don't upset yourself.
After breakfast we'll call the doctor.

386
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,658
I'd better go to a hospital.

387
00:36:55,868 --> 00:36:58,285
You know best,
but see what the doctor says first.

388
00:36:58,578 --> 00:37:00,996
I can't stay here,
causing you all this trouble.

389
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:02,039
I'm not complaining.

390
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,460
You should, I'm such a bore.

391
00:37:06,294 --> 00:37:09,213
But it's not my fault.
You would save my life.

392
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,715
Well, we all make mistakes!

393
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:15,260
I'm sorry.

394
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:20,599
You should be. A young girl like you
wanting to throw your life away.

395
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:24,561
When you're my age,
you'll want to hang on to it.

396
00:37:25,395 --> 00:37:26,646
Why?

397
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:29,773
Well, at this stage of the game
life gets to be a habit.

398
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:32,360
A hopeless one.

399
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:35,404
Then live without hope.
Live for the moment.

400
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:38,615
There are still, there are still...

401
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:40,619
There are still wonderful moments.

402
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:42,162
But if you've lost your health!

403
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:47,166
My dear, I was given up for dead
six months ago, but I fought back.

404
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,043
That's what you must do.

405
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:51,253
I'm tired of fighting.

406
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:56,342
Because you're fighting yourself.
You won't give yourself a chance.

407
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,095
But the fight for happiness
is beautiful.

408
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:01,346
Happiness...

409
00:38:01,556 --> 00:38:04,600
- There is such a thing.
- Where?

410
00:38:04,892 --> 00:38:09,396
Listen, as a child I used to complain
to my father about not having toys

411
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:14,902
<i>and he would say this
is the greatest toy ever created.</i>

412
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,029
Here lies
the secret of all happiness.

413
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:22,116
To hear you talk, no one would
ever think you were a comedian.

414
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:26,913
I'm beginning to realize that.
It's the reason I can't get a job.

415
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:30,124
Why?

416
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:34,087
Because they have no imagination.

417
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:37,549
Or think because I'm getting
on in years I'm old, all washed up.

418
00:38:39,301 --> 00:38:42,846
Never! After hearing you talk.

419
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:45,972
Perhaps I drank too much.

420
00:38:46,516 --> 00:38:48,184
There's usually a reason
for drinking.

421
00:38:50,352 --> 00:38:52,228
Unhappiness, I suppose.

422
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:55,983
No, I'm used to that.

423
00:38:58,193 --> 00:39:00,778
It was more complicated.

424
00:39:01,946 --> 00:39:05,366
As a man gets on in years
he wants to live deeply.

425
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:11,206
A feeling of sad dignity comes upon
him, and that's fatal for a comic.

426
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,083
It affected my work.

427
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:16,212
I lost contact with the audience,
couldn't warm up to them.

428
00:39:17,462 --> 00:39:19,880
And that's what started me drinking.

429
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,966
I had to have it before I went on.

430
00:39:22,174 --> 00:39:25,386
It got so I couldn't be funny
without it. The more I drank...

431
00:39:26,346 --> 00:39:28,221
It became a vicious circle.

432
00:39:28,515 --> 00:39:29,557
What happened?

433
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:31,977
A heart attack. I almost died.

434
00:39:32,685 --> 00:39:34,562
And you're still drinking?

435
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:36,980
Occasionally, if I think of things.

436
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:40,526
The wrong things I suppose,
as you do.

437
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:43,654
What would you like
for your breakfast?

438
00:39:44,154 --> 00:39:46,781
What a sad business, being funny.

439
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,202
Very sad if they won't laugh.

440
00:39:50,745 --> 00:39:52,288
But it's a thrill when they do.

441
00:39:52,496 --> 00:39:55,207
To look out there
and see them all laughing,

442
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,711
to hear that roar go up,
waves of laughter coming at you.

443
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:02,297
Let's talk of something
more cheerful.

444
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,924
Besides I want to forget the public.

445
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:07,843
Never. You love them too much.

446
00:40:08,053 --> 00:40:10,555
Maybe I love them,
but I don't admire them.

447
00:40:10,764 --> 00:40:11,889
I think you do.

448
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:15,143
As individuals, yes.
There's greatness in everyone.

449
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:18,979
But as a crowd, they're like
a monster without a head

450
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:21,898
that never knows which way
it's going to turn.

451
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,735
It can be prodded in any direction.

452
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:29,950
I keep forgetting about breakfast.
How about some poached eggs?

453
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:32,451
Come in.

454
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:36,914
- A telegram.
- Oh, thank you.

455
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:52,680
Are you all right?

456
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:55,181
This is what I've been waiting for.

457
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:57,476
Good news?

458
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,270
Redfern, my agent, wants to see me.

459
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:02,271
Wonderful!

460
00:41:03,106 --> 00:41:06,234
You're right.
This is the turning point.

461
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:09,987
Those managers have been holding
out on me, breaking my morale.

462
00:41:10,196 --> 00:41:11,947
But now they want me!

463
00:41:12,782 --> 00:41:17,911
And now I'll make them pay!
For their contempt and indifference.

464
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:20,081
No, I'll be gracious.

465
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,917
That'll be more dignified,
put them in their place.

466
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:24,794
I'm to be at Redfern's office
at three.

467
00:41:25,002 --> 00:41:27,504
I'll call the doctor
and tell him about your legs.

468
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:29,589
But I forgot your breakfast!

469
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:32,509
How about some nice kippers?

470
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:53,363
Nothing for you, or you, or you...

471
00:41:55,656 --> 00:41:56,907
Nothing for you.

472
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:08,668
- Anyone waiting?
- Miss Parker.

473
00:42:08,878 --> 00:42:09,837
Anyone else?

474
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:12,965
Yes, Calvero.
He's been here since three.

475
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:15,551
I forgot all about him.
Show him in.

476
00:42:21,598 --> 00:42:24,517
Good afternoon, Calvero.
Sit down.

477
00:42:24,726 --> 00:42:29,314
Sorry about yesterday. I was held up
over some important business.

478
00:42:29,732 --> 00:42:31,317
However, I've good news for you.

479
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:33,819
I can get you a week
at Middlesex Music Hall.

480
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,695
At what terms?

481
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,406
I don't know yet,
but I wouldn't bother about that.

482
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:40,075
No bother at all.

483
00:42:40,784 --> 00:42:43,619
However, if money's no object,

484
00:42:43,912 --> 00:42:46,747
- what billing am I to get?
- I wouldn't bother about that either.

485
00:42:47,374 --> 00:42:49,876
I'm not to get star billing
at Middlesex?

486
00:42:50,294 --> 00:42:51,628
I'm not sure
we can book you there.

487
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,880
You think I'd allow those managers
to throw in my name

488
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:59,343
with a lot of nondescripts
just to build up their reputation!

489
00:42:59,552 --> 00:43:01,345
Calvero's still a name
to conjure with!

490
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,682
You're mistaken.
Today it means nothing.

491
00:43:05,308 --> 00:43:06,642
Then why do they want me?

492
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,352
They don't want you.
They're doing me a favor.

493
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:13,232
Very kind of them.
I hope you appreciate the fact.

494
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,776
I'm going to be perfectly frank
with you.

495
00:43:16,986 --> 00:43:19,988
I've been talking Calvero
to them for over six months.

496
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,659
Your name is poison.
They don't want to touch you.

497
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:25,536
They couldn't if they tried.

498
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:31,374
I'm sorry, but you must
be made to realize the facts.

499
00:43:33,335 --> 00:43:35,544
You're succeeding splendidly.

500
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:39,799
I'm trying to help, that's all.
But you must cooperate.

501
00:43:43,345 --> 00:43:45,346
Whatever you say, I'll do.

502
00:43:45,554 --> 00:43:46,805
That's the spirit.

503
00:43:47,014 --> 00:43:50,142
As soon as the contract's confirmed,
I'll let you know.

504
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:58,151
However, cheer up.

505
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:03,780
If my name is poison to them,
I won't use it.

506
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:07,325
- I'll go by another name.
- I think that's a splendid idea.

507
00:44:17,878 --> 00:44:20,171
Well doctor, how is our patient?

508
00:44:20,798 --> 00:44:25,051
The condition is cleared up, but
I find nothing wrong with her legs.

509
00:44:25,594 --> 00:44:27,469
Didn't she tell you
she's had rheumatic fever?

510
00:44:27,678 --> 00:44:29,138
Yes, but I don't think she has.

511
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,848
The heart would have been affected
and it's perfectly sound.

512
00:44:32,684 --> 00:44:34,977
I believe it's a case
of psycho-anesthesia.

513
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,228
What's that?

514
00:44:36,938 --> 00:44:40,191
A form of hysteria that has
the characteristics of paralysis

515
00:44:40,483 --> 00:44:41,734
without being so.

516
00:44:41,943 --> 00:44:42,902
How do you account for it?

517
00:44:43,402 --> 00:44:46,530
In her case, I'd say
it's psychological, self-imposed.

518
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:50,201
Having failed at suicide,
she's decided to become a cripple.

519
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:52,286
Is there any way I can help?

520
00:44:52,578 --> 00:44:56,665
Primarily she must help herself.
It's a case for a psychologist.

521
00:44:56,957 --> 00:44:58,332
Doctor Freud.

522
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,710
Well, I'll see what I can do.

523
00:45:01,754 --> 00:45:03,422
- Good day, Doctor.
- Good day.

524
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,054
Tell me more
about your sister Louise.

525
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:14,390
There's nothing more to tell.

526
00:45:15,308 --> 00:45:18,352
When she couldn't find work
she was driven to the street.

527
00:45:19,271 --> 00:45:21,481
How old were you
when you discovered this?

528
00:45:21,773 --> 00:45:22,940
About eight.

529
00:45:24,692 --> 00:45:26,068
Tell me about it.

530
00:45:26,694 --> 00:45:30,114
It was after my mother died.
I loved Louise.

531
00:45:30,323 --> 00:45:33,867
She was everything to me,
supported me, had me taught dancing.

532
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:36,912
Then one day I realized
what she was doing.

533
00:45:37,413 --> 00:45:39,622
I was coming home from dancing
with the other girls

534
00:45:39,832 --> 00:45:44,503
and I saw her, and the other girls
saw her, walking the street.

535
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,715
What did you do?

536
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,841
I just ran and wept.

537
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:51,927
Ran and wept.

538
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:54,303
Then what happened?

539
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:56,724
I tried to forget.

540
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,103
I was sent to boarding school. At 16,
I left and joined the Empire Ballet.

541
00:46:01,728 --> 00:46:04,939
Louise went to South America.
I haven't heard from her since.

542
00:46:07,026 --> 00:46:10,361
Up to that time,
you had no trouble with your legs?

543
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:11,737
No.

544
00:46:12,656 --> 00:46:14,032
When did it start?

545
00:46:14,324 --> 00:46:17,660
About two years later.
After Melise joined the ballet.

546
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:19,953
Who's Melise?

547
00:46:20,163 --> 00:46:22,248
One of the girls
from the dancing school.

548
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,377
One who was with you
when you found out about Louise?

549
00:46:28,713 --> 00:46:31,423
Mr. Freud would say
that since meeting this girl again,

550
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:33,634
you don't want to dance.

551
00:46:33,842 --> 00:46:35,093
Why?

552
00:46:35,386 --> 00:46:38,013
You've associated it
with the unhappy life of your sister

553
00:46:38,222 --> 00:46:41,642
who paid for your lessons
through a life of shame.

554
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,144
You've been ashamed to dance
ever since.

555
00:46:44,478 --> 00:46:46,855
I'd despise myself
if I thought that.

556
00:46:47,064 --> 00:46:48,732
That's the trouble, you do.

557
00:46:48,941 --> 00:46:52,402
That's the trouble with the world.
We all despise ourselves.

558
00:46:55,197 --> 00:46:56,781
Streetwalking!

559
00:46:58,742 --> 00:47:01,452
We're all grubbing for a living,
the best of us.

560
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:05,206
All a part of the human crusade,

561
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:08,250
written in water.

562
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,336
But enough of that.

563
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:12,295
Ever been in love?

564
00:47:13,048 --> 00:47:14,508
No, not really.

565
00:47:15,341 --> 00:47:17,426
I think it was more
a feeling of pity.

566
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:20,137
The plot thickens.
Tell me about it.

567
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,018
It's a ridiculous story.
I hardly knew the man.

568
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:28,062
It was something I built up
in my own mind.

569
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,230
<i>It was after I came out
of the hospital.</i>

570
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,609
<i>I took a job
at Sardou's stationary shop.</i>

571
00:47:35,443 --> 00:47:39,323
<i>He was one of the customers,
a young American.</i>

572
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,908
<i>He used to buy music paper</i>

573
00:47:42,117 --> 00:47:45,161
<i>in large and small amounts,
according to his finances.</i>

574
00:47:45,787 --> 00:47:49,832
<i>He seemed so lonely,
so helpless and shy.</i>

575
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,876
<i>There was something pathetic
about him.</i>

576
00:47:53,378 --> 00:47:56,715
<i>I wouldn't have noticed him,
but someone tried to elbow in.</i>

577
00:47:57,131 --> 00:48:00,468
<i>When I ignored the other man,
he smiled in gratitude.</i>

578
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:05,264
<i>The old charwoman who worked where
he lived told me he was Mr. Neville,</i>

579
00:48:05,474 --> 00:48:08,725
<i>a composer,
and that he occupied the top room.</i>

580
00:48:09,352 --> 00:48:12,689
<i>There were days I knew he went
without food to buy music paper.</i>

581
00:48:12,897 --> 00:48:14,647
<i>I could see it in his eyes.</i>

582
00:48:14,857 --> 00:48:16,442
<i>The haggard look.</i>

583
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:18,818
<i>Sometimes I'd throw in
a few extra sheets.</i>

584
00:48:19,027 --> 00:48:21,446
<i>Once I gave him more
than his proper change,</i>

585
00:48:21,655 --> 00:48:24,366
<i>which he might have noticed,
but I wasn't sure.</i>

586
00:48:24,574 --> 00:48:29,371
<i>Often after work I'd stroll by his
house and hear him playing piano,</i>

587
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,917
<i>repeating musical passages
over and over again.</i>

588
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:37,504
<i>And I'd stand listening,
excited and melancholy.</i>

589
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:02,111
Well, what then?

590
00:49:06,573 --> 00:49:08,576
Then for weeks I never saw him.

591
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:14,081
The charwoman told me he was ill.
Creditors had taken his piano.

592
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:18,668
<i>Eventually he came into the shop
looking very pale</i>

593
00:49:19,086 --> 00:49:22,131
<i>and asked for two shillings worth
of large orchestral sheets,</i>

594
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:25,049
<i>placing a two shilling piece
on the counter.</i>

595
00:49:25,675 --> 00:49:27,551
<i>I knew it was his last.</i>

596
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,932
<i>If I could only help him!
If I only dared!</i>

597
00:49:32,223 --> 00:49:35,143
<i>I could lend him money.
I wanted to tell him so.</i>

598
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:38,187
<i>But I was also shy.</i>

599
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:42,233
<i>Nevertheless
I was determined to help.</i>

600
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:46,195
<i>I gave him some extra sheets
and as he was about leave</i>

601
00:49:46,404 --> 00:49:47,571
<i>I called him back:</i>

602
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,740
<i>You've forgotten your change.</i>

603
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:52,034
<i>There must be a mistake, he said.</i>

604
00:49:52,243 --> 00:49:53,619
<i>Not at all, I answered.</i>

605
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:56,747
<i>You gave me half a crown,
here's sixpence change.</i>

606
00:49:57,373 --> 00:50:00,585
<i>Then I realized I had created
a ridiculous situation.</i>

607
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:03,837
<i>To make matters worse
in came Mr. Sardou:</i>

608
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:06,006
<i>Can I be of any assistance?</i>

609
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:08,007
<i>It isn't necessary, I said quickly.</i>

610
00:50:08,301 --> 00:50:11,220
<i>The gentleman gave me half a crown
and forgot his change.</i>

611
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:14,263
<i>However,
Mr. Sardou made him take it.</i>

612
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:17,600
<i>But as soon as he left
Mr. Sardou went through the till</i>

613
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:20,812
<i>and finding no half crown there,
became suspicious.</i>

614
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:24,358
The discrepancy was discovered
and I was discharged.

615
00:50:24,565 --> 00:50:25,608
What did you do then?

616
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:30,112
I tried to get back to dancing,
then I collapsed with rheumatic fever.

617
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:33,448
Did you ever see
this young composer again?

618
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:37,827
Yes, five months later.
After I came out of the hospital.

619
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:40,621
I saw him from the gallery
of the Albert Hall.

620
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:44,168
His symphony was played there.
It was a great success.

621
00:50:44,377 --> 00:50:46,586
Of course you're in love with him.

622
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:48,339
I don't even know him.

623
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:52,009
You will.
Life is a local affair.

624
00:50:52,301 --> 00:50:53,969
I can see it happening.

625
00:50:55,012 --> 00:50:58,264
You'll be at the height
of your success and he'll call on you,

626
00:50:58,474 --> 00:51:00,976
and tell you he met you
at some super party.

627
00:51:01,185 --> 00:51:02,435
Won't I recognize him?

628
00:51:02,728 --> 00:51:05,855
Oh no. He's grown a beard.
Musicians do.

629
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:11,277
He'll tell you
he's composed a ballet for you.

630
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:15,239
And you'll realize who he is,
you'll tell him who you are

631
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:18,493
and how you met,
and how you waited on him.

632
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:21,496
And gave him extra music sheets.

633
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:26,000
And that night you'll dine together

634
00:51:26,627 --> 00:51:30,463
on a balcony
overlooking the Thames.

635
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,965
It'll be summer.

636
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:36,302
And you'll be wearing
pink mousseline.

637
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:39,764
And he'll be conscious
of its fragrance.

638
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,559
And all London
will be dreamy and beautiful.

639
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,730
And in the elegant melancholy
of twilight,

640
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:52,275
as the candles flutter
and make your eyes dance,

641
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,987
he will tell you he loves you.

642
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,532
And you will tell him
you have always loved him.

643
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,911
Where am I?

644
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,498
Yes, life can be wonderful
if you're not afraid of it.

645
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:13,546
All it needs is courage, imagination

646
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:18,133
and a little dough.

647
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,014
Now what's the matter?

648
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,266
I'll never dance again!
I'm a cripple.

649
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,977
- Pure hysteria! It's in your mind.
- It isn't true.

650
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:31,688
- Otherwise you'd fight!
- What is there to fight for?

651
00:52:31,897 --> 00:52:34,066
Ah, you see? You admit it.

652
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,902
What is there to fight for?
Everything!

653
00:52:37,403 --> 00:52:39,195
Life itself! Isn't that enough?

654
00:52:39,488 --> 00:52:43,574
To be lived, suffered, enjoyed!
What is there to fight for?

655
00:52:43,784 --> 00:52:46,369
Life is a beautiful,
magnificent thing.

656
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:48,454
Even to a jellyfish.

657
00:52:49,289 --> 00:52:53,252
What is there to fight for?
You have your art, your dancing!

658
00:52:53,668 --> 00:52:55,544
But I can't dance without legs!

659
00:52:55,963 --> 00:52:57,756
I know a man without arms

660
00:52:58,047 --> 00:53:02,342
who can play a scherzo on a violin
and does it all with his toes.

661
00:53:02,552 --> 00:53:05,262
The trouble is you won't fight.
You've given in.

662
00:53:05,471 --> 00:53:07,849
Continually dwelling
on sickness and death!

663
00:53:08,057 --> 00:53:09,309
But,

664
00:53:09,642 --> 00:53:12,352
there's something
just as inevitable as death

665
00:53:12,562 --> 00:53:14,730
and that's life.
Life, life, life!

666
00:53:15,148 --> 00:53:17,150
Think of the power
that's in the universe!

667
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,068
Moving the earth, growing the trees!

668
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:22,654
And that's the same power
within you.

669
00:53:22,863 --> 00:53:26,743
If you'd only have courage
and the will to use it.

670
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,162
Good night!

671
00:53:36,752 --> 00:53:39,337
Faster, faster.
Come on, dance!

672
00:53:41,422 --> 00:53:42,591
Beautiful.

673
00:53:47,387 --> 00:53:48,930
I fooled you that time.
Come on.

674
00:53:56,229 --> 00:53:57,814
Take that away.
Come on!

675
00:54:05,739 --> 00:54:07,074
What's the news?

676
00:54:07,406 --> 00:54:09,491
Europe in a race for armaments.

677
00:54:09,993 --> 00:54:11,578
Anything interesting?

678
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:14,787
A write-up about Mr. and
Mrs. Zanzig, the mind readers.

679
00:54:14,997 --> 00:54:16,581
I played with them years ago.

680
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:19,918
They say they can transfer thoughts
to each other.

681
00:54:20,211 --> 00:54:21,044
Nonsense!

682
00:54:21,254 --> 00:54:22,212
Then how is it done?

683
00:54:22,504 --> 00:54:26,383
Not transference. I was with him once
when he sent his wife a telegram.

684
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:33,348
More coffee?

685
00:54:33,765 --> 00:54:35,141
Just a half cup.

686
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,317
I'm sorry, I didn't intend...

687
00:54:44,609 --> 00:54:46,694
Oh no, it's good exercise.

688
00:54:51,074 --> 00:54:54,326
Look at you,
hopping around like a two year-old.

689
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,246
I think there's an improvement.

690
00:54:57,538 --> 00:54:58,705
Definitely.

691
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:04,836
- But I get so nervous doing nothing.
- Nothing?

692
00:55:05,046 --> 00:55:07,047
I welcome every new hole
in your socks.

693
00:55:07,966 --> 00:55:10,384
Housework and cooking,
what more do you want?

694
00:55:10,676 --> 00:55:12,052
Keep fighting, that's all.

695
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:16,515
That reminds me,
Mrs. Alsop's on the warpath again.

696
00:55:16,724 --> 00:55:19,642
She wants to know how long
I'm going to stay.

697
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:22,562
Tell her to mind her own business!
We pay our rent.

698
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:24,146
Oh no, there's a month owing.

699
00:55:25,065 --> 00:55:28,317
Since they postponed the Middlesex
opening, it's upset everything.

700
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,820
Don't worry.
I can handle the old girl.

701
00:55:31,029 --> 00:55:34,032
All she needs
is a little pinch and a pat.

702
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:36,660
Don't you think
I should go to a hospital?

703
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:37,994
I do not.

704
00:55:39,246 --> 00:55:41,455
You'd have one problem
off your hands.

705
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:44,583
After the Middlesex,
our problems are over.

706
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:51,048
You know, preaching and moralizing
to you has really affected me.

707
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:53,634
I'm beginning to believe it myself.

708
00:55:54,052 --> 00:55:56,553
I haven't taken a drink
since I've known you.

709
00:55:56,763 --> 00:55:57,805
Wonderful.

710
00:55:58,014 --> 00:56:00,432
And I'm not going to,
even on opening night.

711
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,309
You don't need it.

712
00:56:02,518 --> 00:56:05,437
You're excruciatingly funny
without it.

713
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,105
Oh, yes.

714
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:11,485
- What's that?
- Maybe a letter from Redfern.

715
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,433
Just the man I want to see!

716
00:56:45,142 --> 00:56:46,727
How thrilling!

717
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,441
This is no joke. When are you
getting rid of that girl upstairs?

718
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:55,068
- Don't be jealous.
- Jealous!

719
00:56:55,277 --> 00:56:57,237
What have you done to your hair?

720
00:56:57,446 --> 00:56:59,114
Where are your spit curls?

721
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:02,867
Never mind all that!
You owe me four weeks' rent.

722
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:05,786
- Have I denied the fact?
- You'd better not.

723
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:11,626
Sybil, you really want to hurt me,
don't you? You little minx.

724
00:57:11,835 --> 00:57:13,086
Behave yourself!

725
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:15,504
I get so full of nonsense
when I'm around you.

726
00:57:15,797 --> 00:57:17,172
You fool!

727
00:57:18,091 --> 00:57:20,093
What about that girl upstairs?

728
00:57:20,385 --> 00:57:21,970
Now, now. Be patient.

729
00:57:22,179 --> 00:57:23,722
You'd better
get rid of her this week.

730
00:57:24,055 --> 00:57:27,057
Bear with me. I know
it's been a trial for both of us.

731
00:57:27,267 --> 00:57:29,477
Both of us!
Who are you kidding?

732
00:57:29,685 --> 00:57:30,728
You!

733
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:34,064
You wonderful
little plum pudding, you!

734
00:57:35,816 --> 00:57:37,693
But we must behave ourselves.

735
00:57:48,329 --> 00:57:50,121
That takes care of the rent.

736
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,958
- Was there any post?
- No. That was for Mrs. Alsop.

737
00:58:02,718 --> 00:58:05,971
<i>Oh for the life of a sardine
That is the life for me</i>

738
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:08,055
<i>Cavorting and spawning
every morning</i>

739
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:09,724
<i>Under the deep blue sea</i>

740
00:58:10,016 --> 00:58:13,560
<i>To have no fear of a fisherman's net
Oh what fun to be gay and all wet</i>

741
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:17,315
<i>Oh for the life of a sardine
That is the life for me</i>

742
00:58:24,113 --> 00:58:25,156
Funny thing,

743
00:58:25,364 --> 00:58:27,115
I dreamt I was a sardine.

744
00:58:27,533 --> 00:58:30,160
I dreamt it was lunchtime,
and I was, uh...

745
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:32,871
swimming along,
looking for a little bit of bait

746
00:58:33,081 --> 00:58:35,791
and I found myself passing
a large bed of kelp.

747
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:39,128
And there on it, I mean in it,

748
00:58:39,419 --> 00:58:42,463
was the prettiest little fin
you've ever seen.

749
00:58:43,298 --> 00:58:46,426
That's what we call them
in the fish world: fins.

750
00:58:47,052 --> 00:58:48,803
The way she maneuvered her tail,

751
00:58:49,638 --> 00:58:51,640
with such finesse.

752
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,724
She seemed to be in trouble.

753
00:58:58,813 --> 00:59:02,358
<i>All right old boy,
let's all go home.</i>

754
00:59:02,566 --> 00:59:05,694
Yeah, you're right. Good night.

755
00:59:14,996 --> 00:59:16,331
I beg your pardon.

756
00:59:23,337 --> 00:59:25,714
Blasted! These shoes are too tight.

757
00:59:39,895 --> 00:59:41,687
Good night.

758
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:51,213
What are you doing up so late?

759
01:00:52,674 --> 01:00:54,467
I just couldn't sleep.

760
01:00:55,926 --> 01:00:59,138
Then I saw the partition doors open,
so I got up an hour ago.

761
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,640
Some hot soup?

762
01:01:02,474 --> 01:01:03,725
No, thanks.

763
01:01:05,103 --> 01:01:06,563
You look tired.

764
01:01:06,771 --> 01:01:07,813
Do I?

765
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,316
I know you're worried,

766
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:15,528
but the Middlesex contract's signed,
it's just the delay.

767
01:01:16,238 --> 01:01:18,114
There's no delay.

768
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:20,951
What do you mean?

769
01:01:21,452 --> 01:01:22,911
It happened tonight.

770
01:01:24,162 --> 01:01:25,538
The Middlesex?

771
01:01:27,415 --> 01:01:29,166
Why didn't you let me know?

772
01:01:29,918 --> 01:01:32,837
I didn't want you to go through
the suspense of it.

773
01:01:34,297 --> 01:01:39,094
Then forget everything now,
and get a good night's rest.

774
01:01:40,846 --> 01:01:42,931
They walked out on me.

775
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:48,060
They haven't done that
since I was a beginner.

776
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:50,145
The cycle's complete.

777
01:01:51,273 --> 01:01:54,108
But you've changed your name!
They didn't know you.

778
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:59,404
No, I wasn't funny.
The trouble is, I was sober.

779
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,742
I should have been drunk
before going on.

780
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:05,577
I still insist
they didn't know you.

781
01:02:05,786 --> 01:02:07,454
Just as well they didn't.

782
01:02:08,372 --> 01:02:11,834
Naturally! You can't expect too much
the first performance.

783
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,336
You haven't worked in a long time.

784
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:17,964
But you'll see, tonight
when you go back it'll be different.

785
01:02:18,507 --> 01:02:20,174
I'm not going back.

786
01:02:21,718 --> 01:02:22,886
Why?

787
01:02:23,511 --> 01:02:27,349
They've terminated the contract.

788
01:02:29,018 --> 01:02:31,019
But they can't do that!

789
01:02:31,436 --> 01:02:33,813
They can. They have.

790
01:02:35,189 --> 01:02:38,400
You were engaged for the week!
You can insist.

791
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:44,239
It's no use. I'm finished.

792
01:02:45,407 --> 01:02:46,742
Through!

793
01:02:48,536 --> 01:02:49,995
Nonsense.

794
01:02:50,913 --> 01:02:54,666
Are you, Calvero, going to allow
one performance to destroy you?

795
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:57,710
Of course not!
You're too great an artist.

796
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,383
Now's the time to show them
what you're made of. Time to fight!

797
01:03:03,008 --> 01:03:06,261
Remember what you told me,
standing there by that window?

798
01:03:06,553 --> 01:03:08,345
Remember what you said?

799
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:11,891
About the power of the universe
moving the earth?

800
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:15,728
Growing the trees,
and that power being within you?

801
01:03:17,188 --> 01:03:20,859
Now is the time to use that power,
and to fight!

802
01:03:23,235 --> 01:03:25,321
Calvero, look! I'm walking!

803
01:03:26,156 --> 01:03:27,114
I'm walking!

804
01:03:29,408 --> 01:03:30,951
I'm walking!

805
01:04:05,903 --> 01:04:09,114
Just think, I can walk!

806
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:12,867
Well, I can't any further.
I have to quit right here.

807
01:04:13,701 --> 01:04:15,494
Do you realize
it's almost five o'clock?

808
01:04:15,703 --> 01:04:18,831
I know. But I couldn't stay
in that room another minute.

809
01:04:19,124 --> 01:04:20,500
I don't blame you.

810
01:04:21,835 --> 01:04:23,211
Cheer up.

811
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:27,590
Look, the dawn is breaking.

812
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:32,177
That's a good omen.

813
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:35,304
I know it. It will be.

814
01:04:36,223 --> 01:04:38,015
It must be.

815
01:04:39,894 --> 01:04:43,647
Don't be discouraged.
You'll get on your feet again.

816
01:04:43,855 --> 01:04:45,107
On my what again?

817
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:47,400
But think how fortunate we are!

818
01:04:47,693 --> 01:04:49,568
At least we both have our health.

819
01:04:49,778 --> 01:04:54,157
Now I can get a job. There's always
chorus work to keep us going.

820
01:04:54,908 --> 01:04:56,033
Us?

821
01:04:56,242 --> 01:04:57,493
Yes.

822
01:04:58,328 --> 01:04:59,371
Us.

823
01:05:00,413 --> 01:05:03,666
You and me. Together.

824
01:06:46,766 --> 01:06:48,434
- Mr. Bodalink!
- What is it?

825
01:06:48,642 --> 01:06:50,936
- The front office, sir.
- Thank you.

826
01:06:52,521 --> 01:06:56,358
Terry, I was about to leave you
a note about Calvero.

827
01:06:56,567 --> 01:06:59,695
Have him see me tomorrow morning
before your audition.

828
01:06:59,903 --> 01:07:02,114
- He's all set for the part.
- Wonderful!

829
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:47,992
Just a minute.

830
01:07:49,243 --> 01:07:51,953
Why, Terry!
I didn't hear you come in.

831
01:07:52,246 --> 01:07:53,413
How could you?

832
01:07:54,123 --> 01:07:56,750
Allow me. My friends,

833
01:07:57,042 --> 01:07:58,627
Mademoiselle Thereza.

834
01:07:59,878 --> 01:08:00,921
How do you do.

835
01:08:02,255 --> 01:08:05,383
We're just having a little beer,
Bach and Beethoven.

836
01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:08,011
Isn't it rather late for music?

837
01:08:08,428 --> 01:08:10,304
Not if we play a nocturne.

838
01:08:11,139 --> 01:08:13,100
Proceed with the butchery,

839
01:08:13,725 --> 01:08:17,605
only make it soft,
sentimental, largo.

840
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:21,774
- I'll stick to beer if you don't mind.
- Coming up!

841
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:23,442
But what will Mrs. Alsop say?

842
01:08:23,651 --> 01:08:27,196
A fine thing! After climbing up
three flights of stairs,

843
01:08:27,489 --> 01:08:32,410
I've just discovered I've got nothing
but a lot of empty beer bottles.

844
01:08:33,245 --> 01:08:36,247
Why, Terry, is the show out?

845
01:08:36,456 --> 01:08:38,749
I didn't realize it was that late.

846
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:40,334
It's very late.

847
01:08:40,543 --> 01:08:42,627
That's our cue, we'd better go.

848
01:08:42,836 --> 01:08:46,256
You're not going!
We were just about to celebrate.

849
01:08:46,466 --> 01:08:49,301
- But it's almost one o'clock.
- So what?

850
01:08:49,594 --> 01:08:50,970
Wait a minute!

851
01:08:51,178 --> 01:08:55,140
Calvero gave me three horses
and I doubled up on them!

852
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:58,476
Now that only happens
once in a lifetime.

853
01:08:58,978 --> 01:09:03,273
Wait a minute. Those stairs
are steep. I'll lead the way.

854
01:09:04,524 --> 01:09:09,321
That's all right, I can handle myself.
Don't you worry about me.

855
01:09:17,037 --> 01:09:18,288
Good night.

856
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:40,600
I'm sorry, my dear. I'm drunk.

857
01:09:41,018 --> 01:09:44,563
It's your health I'm worried about.
You know what the doctor said.

858
01:09:44,855 --> 01:09:49,150
Yes, I shouldn't drink.
It's bad for the heart.

859
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,736
What about the mind?

860
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:56,742
I suppose that should be clear and
alert so I can contemplate the future.

861
01:09:57,367 --> 01:10:00,495
The prospects of joining
those gray-haired nymphs

862
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,413
that sleep
on the Thames embankment at night.

863
01:10:03,622 --> 01:10:05,916
You'll never join them
while I'm alive.

864
01:10:06,126 --> 01:10:09,796
Oh, I forgot to get your supper!
I'm no good.

865
01:10:10,088 --> 01:10:13,840
I'll get it later on.
First I'm going to put you to bed.

866
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:16,261
But you've had nothing to eat.

867
01:10:16,886 --> 01:10:18,345
Did you take your medicine?

868
01:10:18,763 --> 01:10:19,888
What medicine?

869
01:10:20,097 --> 01:10:23,142
You didn't.
It's to give you an appetite.

870
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:25,101
I've quenched my appetite.

871
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,895
You'll be ill again,
if you don't eat.

872
01:10:27,187 --> 01:10:29,897
Well, I much prefer to drink.

873
01:10:30,524 --> 01:10:33,359
A man's true character comes out
when he's drunk.

874
01:10:33,653 --> 01:10:35,528
Me, I'm funnier.

875
01:10:36,696 --> 01:10:38,656
Too bad I didn't drink
at the Middlesex.

876
01:10:38,866 --> 01:10:40,742
I've got good news for you.

877
01:10:40,951 --> 01:10:44,078
Mr. Bodalink wants to see you
tomorrow morning.

878
01:10:44,288 --> 01:10:45,663
Who's he?

879
01:10:45,873 --> 01:10:49,626
Our dance director. He wants you
to play a clown in the new ballet.

880
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:51,920
I'm through clowning.

881
01:10:52,212 --> 01:10:55,131
Life isn't a gag anymore.
I can't see the joke.

882
01:10:55,882 --> 01:10:58,384
From now on, I'm a retired humorist.

883
01:10:58,593 --> 01:11:00,553
You'll feel differently
in the morning.

884
01:11:00,762 --> 01:11:02,638
No, I hate the theatre!

885
01:11:03,473 --> 01:11:06,517
Someday I'll buy
an acre of ground somewhere

886
01:11:06,935 --> 01:11:10,562
and raise a few cut flowers,
and make a living that way.

887
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:25,076
What do you think?
It's all settled. I play the clown.

888
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:30,082
Let's sit down over here
and you can tell me all about it.

889
01:11:37,463 --> 01:11:40,591
Of course, the salary isn't much.

890
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:43,011
Two pounds?

891
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:47,474
But it's a foot in the door.
Naturally I'm not using my own name.

892
01:11:48,015 --> 01:11:51,769
This Bodalink's a nice chap.
Says you're quite a dancer.

893
01:11:51,978 --> 01:11:55,398
If you'd have come to the theatre,
you might have known it.

894
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:58,525
Why didn't you tell me
you were auditioning?

895
01:11:58,735 --> 01:12:00,610
I wanted to surprise you.

896
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:03,864
I'm not sure of the outcome.
It depends on Mr. Postant.

897
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:07,909
Postant!
I thought he'd retired years ago.

898
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:09,995
Why, do you know him?

899
01:12:10,538 --> 01:12:13,457
Last time I worked for Postant,
I was the headline here.

900
01:12:13,874 --> 01:12:15,334
Footlights!

901
01:12:36,062 --> 01:12:37,522
Your hands are quite cold.

902
01:12:38,064 --> 01:12:41,275
I think I've got the girl. Young,
sympathetic, a brilliant dancer.

903
01:12:41,484 --> 01:12:43,487
Bring her on!

904
01:12:43,695 --> 01:12:45,363
Thereza, please!

905
01:12:47,115 --> 01:12:49,408
You understand
it's purely improvising.

906
01:12:49,618 --> 01:12:52,453
That's how I always judge a dancer.

907
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:55,663
This is Thereza, Mr. Postant.

908
01:12:55,873 --> 01:12:57,040
- How do you do.
- How do you do.

909
01:12:57,249 --> 01:13:00,877
You'll be dancing to Mr. Neville's
music. Listen to it first.

910
01:13:02,255 --> 01:13:04,632
This is Mr. Neville, our composer.

911
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:08,801
- How do you do.
- How do you do.

912
01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:13,097
I believe we've met before.

913
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:15,059
Really?

914
01:14:59,034 --> 01:15:02,579
It's 12:30, we'd better call lunch.
Lunch everybody! Back at 1:30.

915
01:15:03,205 --> 01:15:06,625
Allow me to congratulate
the next prima ballerina.

916
01:15:06,834 --> 01:15:09,753
You're sopping wet, my dear.
Get your coat.

917
01:15:10,921 --> 01:15:13,923
Put in on and then
we'll talk business.

918
01:15:14,132 --> 01:15:15,717
Allow me.

919
01:15:17,802 --> 01:15:20,513
- May I also congratulate you?
- Thank you.

920
01:15:24,059 --> 01:15:28,438
Come dear. We'll meet at my office
at 2:30 and fix up her contract.

921
01:15:28,647 --> 01:15:29,689
But we're rehearsing at 2.

922
01:15:29,897 --> 01:15:31,648
Make it 6, after rehearsal.

923
01:15:31,857 --> 01:15:35,110
Run up to your dressing room
before you get a chill.

924
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:38,029
- Where's Neville?
- Coming!

925
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,830
<i>All right Frank,
turn off those lights.</i>

926
01:16:09,728 --> 01:16:10,771
Here I am.

927
01:16:16,484 --> 01:16:18,569
I was looking for you outside.

928
01:16:18,778 --> 01:16:21,196
What are you doing
sitting in the dark?

929
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,659
I'd be ridiculous in the light.
Look at me, I'm shameless.

930
01:16:26,703 --> 01:16:28,370
But I can't help it.

931
01:16:30,664 --> 01:16:34,543
My dear, you are a true artist.

932
01:16:37,254 --> 01:16:38,922
True artist.

933
01:16:42,343 --> 01:16:44,970
This is absurd. Ridiculous.

934
01:16:51,517 --> 01:16:53,519
I've waited for this moment.

935
01:16:55,063 --> 01:16:56,439
I love you.

936
01:16:59,025 --> 01:17:01,652
I've wanted to say it for so long.

937
01:17:02,278 --> 01:17:05,906
Ever since the day you thought
I was a woman of the street.

938
01:17:06,742 --> 01:17:08,618
You took me in,

939
01:17:09,577 --> 01:17:10,911
cared for me,

940
01:17:12,163 --> 01:17:14,039
saved my life,

941
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:16,959
inspired it.

942
01:17:17,501 --> 01:17:20,087
But above all that,
I just love you.

943
01:17:21,047 --> 01:17:24,467
Please, Calvero, marry me.

944
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:28,345
- What nonsense is this?
- It isn't nonsense.

945
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,889
My dear, I'm an old man.

946
01:17:32,098 --> 01:17:34,059
I don't care what you are.

947
01:17:34,268 --> 01:17:37,604
I love you.
That's all that matters.

948
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:44,401
Latest news, express!

949
01:17:44,612 --> 01:17:47,948
While you're having lunch,
I'm going to see about my wig.

950
01:17:48,156 --> 01:17:49,198
Then I'll go with you.

951
01:17:49,407 --> 01:17:52,117
You'd better have lunch first.
I might be delayed.

952
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:54,203
I'll see you back at the theatre.

953
01:17:55,663 --> 01:17:56,748
Have a good lunch.

954
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,341
Oh, hello there.

955
01:18:03,048 --> 01:18:05,880
I'm the man at the piano
who played a moment ago.

956
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:08,380
It's quite crowded.

957
01:18:08,588 --> 01:18:09,920
Always is at lunch time.

958
01:18:10,253 --> 01:18:11,169
Two?

959
01:18:14,001 --> 01:18:15,459
Very well.

960
01:18:31,782 --> 01:18:33,156
Your order, please.

961
01:18:37,113 --> 01:18:38,778
Bacon and eggs, toast and tea.

962
01:18:39,612 --> 01:18:40,945
The same.

963
01:18:43,777 --> 01:18:45,525
That's always safe.

964
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,981
Beautiful day to be rehearsing.

965
01:18:51,146 --> 01:18:53,770
Although the papers
are predicting more rain.

966
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,436
Really?

967
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:00,849
What's the joke?

968
01:19:01,557 --> 01:19:05,305
I finally have the chance to talk
to you and I've nothing to say.

969
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:08,220
What is more eloquent than silence?

970
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:12,593
- I'd better change tables.
- I won't bite.

971
01:19:13,343 --> 01:19:17,591
I'm not too sure. I was
severely frostbitten a moment ago.

972
01:19:18,423 --> 01:19:19,589
What do you mean?

973
01:19:19,798 --> 01:19:22,171
This morning.
When we were introduced.

974
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,962
I don't understand.

975
01:19:24,587 --> 01:19:27,501
My reception was rather cool,
I thought.

976
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,458
I still don't understand.

977
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:31,332
I'm sorry.

978
01:19:31,749 --> 01:19:33,539
I seem to be getting
a little involved.

979
01:19:33,956 --> 01:19:36,746
You see, I had an idea
that we'd met before.

980
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,745
Well, perhaps we have.

981
01:19:39,244 --> 01:19:41,867
If we haven't,
then you have a twin sister.

982
01:19:42,909 --> 01:19:44,034
Who is she?

983
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:46,657
Do you really want to know?

984
01:19:47,281 --> 01:19:48,614
Yes.

985
01:19:49,781 --> 01:19:51,863
A young girl
who used to work at Sardou's,

986
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:54,985
a stationary shop
where I bought music paper.

987
01:19:55,278 --> 01:19:57,901
A very shy, reticent girl.

988
01:19:58,318 --> 01:19:59,858
She seldom spoke.

989
01:20:00,816 --> 01:20:03,398
But her smile was warm
and appealing.

990
01:20:04,647 --> 01:20:06,729
I read many things into it.

991
01:20:08,312 --> 01:20:12,475
I also was shy.
It was a bond between us.

992
01:20:12,976 --> 01:20:15,599
She used to give me
extra music sheets,

993
01:20:16,016 --> 01:20:18,305
and occasionally extra change.

994
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:23,178
Which, frankly, I accepted.
Hunger has no conscience.

995
01:20:24,636 --> 01:20:27,342
The day after my symphony
played the Albert Hall,

996
01:20:28,093 --> 01:20:29,341
I went back to the shop,

997
01:20:30,174 --> 01:20:34,213
but she'd gone.
They said she'd left months ago.

998
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:37,546
You haven't seen her since?

999
01:20:37,962 --> 01:20:39,336
Well, have I?

1000
01:20:42,126 --> 01:20:43,584
Yes, you have.

1001
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:45,249
I know.

1002
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:48,913
I lost my job giving you
those extra music sheets.

1003
01:20:49,413 --> 01:20:52,119
- You won't hold that against me?
- Of course not.

1004
01:20:52,662 --> 01:20:54,619
I was very young then.

1005
01:20:54,827 --> 01:20:56,410
You're very young now.

1006
01:20:56,702 --> 01:21:00,657
I don't know.
Soon I shall be an old married lady.

1007
01:21:02,323 --> 01:21:04,196
Then I wish you lots of happiness.

1008
01:21:05,154 --> 01:21:06,279
Thank you.

1009
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:08,809
I wish that waitress would hurry.

1010
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:13,472
Before we do the choreography,
I'll explain the story.

1011
01:21:15,984 --> 01:21:17,783
It's about Harlequinade.

1012
01:21:17,993 --> 01:21:21,342
Terry is Columbine.
She is dying in a London garret.

1013
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:25,400
Harlequin, who is the lover, and the
clowns, are standing by the bedside.

1014
01:21:25,611 --> 01:21:27,620
She asks to be carried
to the window.

1015
01:21:27,829 --> 01:21:30,549
She wants to look upon the rooftops
one last time.

1016
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,689
The clowns weep. She smiles.

1017
01:21:33,898 --> 01:21:36,284
Their clothes are not for sorrow
but for laughter.

1018
01:21:36,493 --> 01:21:38,795
She wants them to perform,
do their tricks.

1019
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:41,097
That's the chance for the
clowns to get in their comedy.

1020
01:21:41,306 --> 01:21:43,316
- While she's dying?
- Yes.

1021
01:21:43,526 --> 01:21:45,199
Let me see, where am I?

1022
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,640
As the clowns perform,
she becomes delirious.

1023
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:53,989
Spirits of Columbines
dance before her.

1024
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,421
Then she dies.
That's the first scene.

1025
01:21:57,631 --> 01:22:00,686
Next is the graveyard
where Columbine was buried.

1026
01:22:00,896 --> 01:22:03,700
Harlequin, her lover,
enters in the moonlight.

1027
01:22:03,909 --> 01:22:07,258
With his magic wand he tries
to resurrect her from the grave.

1028
01:22:08,011 --> 01:22:09,560
But he fails.

1029
01:22:09,895 --> 01:22:11,987
The spirits tell him not to grieve.

1030
01:22:12,197 --> 01:22:14,498
His love is not in the grave,
but everywhere.

1031
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,638
Then Terry appears.

1032
01:22:17,931 --> 01:22:19,521
That's your solo, then the finale.

1033
01:22:19,731 --> 01:22:22,710
We'd better get a move on.
It's only 3 weeks to the opening.

1034
01:28:53,827 --> 01:28:55,077
Calvero!

1035
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:58,328
What is it?

1036
01:28:58,538 --> 01:29:00,830
- How's it going?
- Wonderful. Thumbs up.

1037
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:03,747
- I wish the dance was over.
- You've nothing to worry about.

1038
01:29:03,957 --> 01:29:05,832
I'm scared. Pray for me.

1039
01:29:06,041 --> 01:29:09,791
God helps those
who help themselves. Good luck.

1040
01:29:26,052 --> 01:29:28,760
- I can't go on!
- What?

1041
01:29:28,969 --> 01:29:31,261
My legs! I can't move!

1042
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:32,387
It's nerves. Just move.

1043
01:29:32,596 --> 01:29:35,515
No, I can't move. I'm paralyzed!

1044
01:29:35,723 --> 01:29:38,641
Pure hysteria!
There's your cue, get on stage!

1045
01:29:38,849 --> 01:29:43,226
No, I'm falling!
It's my legs, they're paralyzed!

1046
01:29:45,101 --> 01:29:46,686
Get on that stage!

1047
01:29:47,937 --> 01:29:50,938
See? There's nothing wrong
with your legs.

1048
01:30:21,078 --> 01:30:25,955
Whoever you are, whatever it is,
just keep her going, that's all.

1049
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:30,125
I've lost a button.

1050
01:30:31,709 --> 01:30:33,167
One of these.

1051
01:30:34,419 --> 01:30:36,080
It's all right.

1052
01:34:23,131 --> 01:34:26,457
What happened to Calvero?
He told me to wait for him here.

1053
01:34:26,664 --> 01:34:28,950
I'll send the call boy
to look for him.

1054
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:33,606
Supper is served.
You're sitting next to Mr. Postant.

1055
01:34:35,686 --> 01:34:38,929
Supper is now being served
in both lounges.

1056
01:34:46,413 --> 01:34:49,613
Come along, my dear.
You're next to me.

1057
01:34:49,947 --> 01:34:52,857
Bodalink, you're down there
my dear fellow.

1058
01:35:00,756 --> 01:35:02,709
Destiny must be a headwaitress.

1059
01:35:02,918 --> 01:35:04,164
Why?

1060
01:35:04,498 --> 01:35:06,452
She seats us together again.

1061
01:35:07,699 --> 01:35:09,486
She might be your nemesis.

1062
01:35:10,318 --> 01:35:12,479
I think I'll stand up
under the punishment.

1063
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:16,429
However, my congratulations.
Tonight you were wonderful.

1064
01:35:16,970 --> 01:35:19,672
In other words that's they call
the old army game.

1065
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,998
Neville, they tell me
the army's caught up with you.

1066
01:35:24,869 --> 01:35:26,199
You've joined the army?

1067
01:35:26,532 --> 01:35:30,563
On the contrary, the army joined me.
I was drafted.

1068
01:35:30,773 --> 01:35:31,728
That's awful!

1069
01:35:31,937 --> 01:35:34,639
I agree.
It's carrying the war too far.

1070
01:35:34,847 --> 01:35:37,839
However, there's the possibility
of joining up here.

1071
01:35:39,087 --> 01:35:40,251
Would you like to dance?

1072
01:35:40,459 --> 01:35:43,798
I appeal to your patriotism.
You can't refuse a soldier.

1073
01:35:46,386 --> 01:35:49,516
Governor, I remember
when you played Widow Twankey

1074
01:35:49,725 --> 01:35:53,397
at the Theatre Royal,
Birmingham, in 1890...

1075
01:35:53,606 --> 01:35:55,901
Go easy there laddie, go easy.

1076
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:57,654
Let's have a drink.

1077
01:36:01,954 --> 01:36:05,501
Calvero, old boy,
how's the world treating you?

1078
01:36:05,709 --> 01:36:08,421
Rather aggressively at the moment.

1079
01:36:08,632 --> 01:36:10,092
You don't know me.

1080
01:36:10,385 --> 01:36:12,888
The fact is most gratifying.

1081
01:36:13,097 --> 01:36:14,891
Is that supposed to be funny?

1082
01:36:15,935 --> 01:36:19,690
My man, you will never know.
Have a little drink.

1083
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:22,070
Only have it
at the other end of the bar.

1084
01:36:28,957 --> 01:36:32,629
Pardon me, Miss Thereza is waiting
for you in the dress circle.

1085
01:36:34,716 --> 01:36:35,550
What is it?

1086
01:36:35,759 --> 01:36:38,472
Miss Thereza is waiting for you
in the dress circle.

1087
01:36:39,307 --> 01:36:44,315
Will you kindly tell her not to worry,
I've gone home to bed.

1088
01:36:45,150 --> 01:36:46,276
Very well, sir.

1089
01:36:48,364 --> 01:36:49,950
What's happened to Calvero?

1090
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:53,498
He left word that he was tired
and had gone home to rest.

1091
01:36:53,706 --> 01:36:57,963
I must go at once. Say good night
to Mr. Postant for me.

1092
01:37:00,383 --> 01:37:01,719
I'll get you a cab.

1093
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:39,907
I'll walk home.

1094
01:37:47,337 --> 01:37:51,510
He must be asleep, poor dear.
Too much excitement for him.

1095
01:37:51,927 --> 01:37:54,222
I'm beginning
to feel the strain myself.

1096
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,558
Then I'll be going.

1097
01:37:55,768 --> 01:37:57,562
Shall we see you
before you leave for camp?

1098
01:37:57,979 --> 01:37:59,523
I leave this morning.

1099
01:38:01,944 --> 01:38:03,195
Good bye, Terry.

1100
01:38:08,205 --> 01:38:09,540
No, don't!

1101
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:11,418
Say you love me, just a little.

1102
01:38:11,627 --> 01:38:12,670
Please!

1103
01:38:13,004 --> 01:38:14,465
I've tried to fight it, but I can't.

1104
01:38:14,673 --> 01:38:17,177
Please, it's useless.

1105
01:38:17,386 --> 01:38:21,016
You're as helpless as I am.
We love each other.

1106
01:38:21,643 --> 01:38:23,437
I never said I loved you.

1107
01:38:23,646 --> 01:38:25,733
Every look, gesture says it!

1108
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:27,611
No, don't say that!

1109
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:29,572
I know how devoted
you are to Calvero,

1110
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:32,410
but marrying him isn't right.
It isn't fair to you.

1111
01:38:33,037 --> 01:38:34,706
You're young, just beginning life.

1112
01:38:34,915 --> 01:38:38,045
This devotion is idealistic.
Your youth!

1113
01:38:38,755 --> 01:38:40,550
But it isn't love.

1114
01:38:44,306 --> 01:38:48,479
No, you're wrong.
I really love him.

1115
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:52,111
You pity him.

1116
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,034
It's more than pity.

1117
01:38:57,953 --> 01:39:01,417
It's something I've lived with,
grown to.

1118
01:39:03,295 --> 01:39:07,886
It's his soul, his sweetness,
his sadness...

1119
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:11,642
Nothing will ever separate me
from that.

1120
01:39:18,613 --> 01:39:19,989
Good night, Terry.

1121
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,536
Good bye.

1122
01:39:42,194 --> 01:39:43,570
Listen to this one:

1123
01:39:43,988 --> 01:39:47,535
"With ease, Thereza pirouetted
and flexed radiant authority.

1124
01:39:47,744 --> 01:39:50,123
"She was light,
quicksilver, efflorescing!

1125
01:39:50,332 --> 01:39:53,169
"A Diana spinning
wisps of beauty about her."

1126
01:39:55,674 --> 01:39:56,925
Very good.

1127
01:39:58,387 --> 01:40:01,099
Well, you've done it.

1128
01:40:02,018 --> 01:40:04,105
How's it feel to wake up famous?

1129
01:40:06,943 --> 01:40:12,034
That's right, have a good cry
and enjoy it. It only happens once.

1130
01:40:17,252 --> 01:40:19,046
Let's marry, soon.

1131
01:40:19,464 --> 01:40:22,803
If we could only get away.
That house in the country,

1132
01:40:23,011 --> 01:40:25,515
where we could have
peace and happiness.

1133
01:40:25,724 --> 01:40:27,268
Happiness.

1134
01:40:27,477 --> 01:40:30,607
The first time I've ever heard you
mention that word.

1135
01:40:31,149 --> 01:40:34,071
- I'm always happy with you.
- Are you?

1136
01:40:34,697 --> 01:40:37,410
Of course. I love you.

1137
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:39,913
Wasted on an old man.

1138
01:40:40,123 --> 01:40:41,458
Love is never wasted.

1139
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:46,467
Terry, you're like a nun, shutting
everything else out for my sake.

1140
01:40:47,218 --> 01:40:49,304
It isn't fair, wasting your youth.

1141
01:40:49,596 --> 01:40:51,390
You deserve more than this.

1142
01:40:53,061 --> 01:40:54,105
Let me go away.

1143
01:40:55,023 --> 01:40:56,608
What's come over you?

1144
01:40:57,443 --> 01:41:00,657
I can't help it!
If I only had the strength to leave!

1145
01:41:00,865 --> 01:41:03,160
But I stay on, tormenting myself.

1146
01:41:03,370 --> 01:41:04,956
The whole thing is false.

1147
01:41:05,164 --> 01:41:09,004
In the few years I have left,
I must have truth.

1148
01:41:11,008 --> 01:41:12,885
That's all I have left.

1149
01:41:14,221 --> 01:41:15,598
Truth.

1150
01:41:17,059 --> 01:41:18,936
That's all I want.

1151
01:41:19,564 --> 01:41:21,858
And if possible, a little dignity.

1152
01:41:22,276 --> 01:41:24,570
If you leave me, I'll kill myself.

1153
01:41:25,073 --> 01:41:28,328
I hate life!
The torment, the cruelty of it.

1154
01:41:28,745 --> 01:41:32,375
I couldn't go on without you!
Don't you understand, I love you!

1155
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:36,966
- You want to love me.
- But I do, I do!

1156
01:41:37,176 --> 01:41:39,805
It's Neville you love.
I don't blame you.

1157
01:41:41,141 --> 01:41:42,518
That isn't true.

1158
01:41:42,727 --> 01:41:45,314
He's the composer
you knew at Sardou's.

1159
01:41:45,857 --> 01:41:48,986
Yes. I didn't tell you
because I thought it...

1160
01:41:49,195 --> 01:41:52,534
Inevitable.
I prophesized it, remember?

1161
01:41:53,578 --> 01:41:55,247
A balcony overlooking the Thames!

1162
01:41:55,456 --> 01:41:57,000
But it isn't true!

1163
01:41:57,209 --> 01:42:00,131
In the twilight
he will tell you he loves you.

1164
01:42:00,339 --> 01:42:02,968
And you will tell him
you've always loved him.

1165
01:42:03,177 --> 01:42:06,391
But I don't love him! I never did.

1166
01:42:06,599 --> 01:42:08,393
It was his music, his art.

1167
01:42:08,603 --> 01:42:10,481
He meant a world
that had been denied me.

1168
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:11,941
You look so well together.

1169
01:42:12,150 --> 01:42:15,572
But I don't love him! I never did.

1170
01:42:16,532 --> 01:42:19,954
Please, you must believe me!
You must!

1171
01:42:22,459 --> 01:42:26,341
Dancing's excellent,
but the comedy's poor.

1172
01:42:26,758 --> 01:42:28,844
We'll have to get rid of that clown.

1173
01:42:34,688 --> 01:42:39,488
I've called Blackmore's Agency,
they're sending down another man.

1174
01:42:39,905 --> 01:42:41,366
You know who that clown is?

1175
01:42:41,574 --> 01:42:44,370
I don't care if it's Calvero himself.
He isn't funny.

1176
01:42:44,579 --> 01:42:46,457
- But that's who it is.
- What?

1177
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:48,877
Calvero,
only he's under another name.

1178
01:42:49,086 --> 01:42:51,590
Why the devil didn't you tell me?

1179
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,468
He didn't want it known.

1180
01:42:53,678 --> 01:42:58,060
Poor old Calvero. Well, that's
different, we'd better keep him.

1181
01:42:59,103 --> 01:43:01,815
After all,
the comedy isn't too important.

1182
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:08,159
But I didn't see him
at the supper party on opening night.

1183
01:43:08,368 --> 01:43:11,206
He didn't show up.
That's why Thereza left so early.

1184
01:43:11,415 --> 01:43:12,541
What's he got to do with her?

1185
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,754
Believe it or not,
she's going to marry him.

1186
01:43:15,046 --> 01:43:16,632
That old reprobate?

1187
01:43:16,841 --> 01:43:19,553
Bless my soul,
there's hope for me yet.

1188
01:43:19,762 --> 01:43:21,932
It's time for rehearsal.

1189
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:23,519
Wait a minute.

1190
01:43:23,728 --> 01:43:27,692
I'll call Blackmore's and cancel
that fellow before he gets down here.

1191
01:43:29,988 --> 01:43:32,074
If you finish rehearsing early,
don't wait for me.

1192
01:43:32,284 --> 01:43:35,622
I've so many things to do,
but I'll be home by six.

1193
01:43:38,961 --> 01:43:41,673
- Calvero?
- Griffin!

1194
01:43:41,883 --> 01:43:44,887
I haven't seen you in ages!
Where are you working?

1195
01:43:45,096 --> 01:43:46,890
Nowhere. I'm looking for a job.

1196
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:49,686
Blackmore sent me down
to see this new ballet.

1197
01:43:49,896 --> 01:43:50,939
The Harlequinade?

1198
01:43:51,148 --> 01:43:53,777
I understand the clown's
not very good

1199
01:43:53,986 --> 01:43:56,908
and I could get the part.
Wish me luck.

1200
01:43:58,368 --> 01:43:59,829
- Good luck, old man.
- Thanks.

1201
01:44:50,830 --> 01:44:52,624
Mrs. Alsop!

1202
01:44:58,468 --> 01:44:59,803
What is it?

1203
01:45:02,224 --> 01:45:03,893
What on earth is the matter?

1204
01:45:04,102 --> 01:45:06,063
Calvero, where is he?
Have you seen him?

1205
01:45:06,273 --> 01:45:08,692
- What do you mean?
- He's left me!

1206
01:45:09,820 --> 01:45:11,489
He's gone!

1207
01:46:15,262 --> 01:46:16,806
Would you like to contribute?

1208
01:46:31,204 --> 01:46:33,499
Captain,
would you like to contribute?

1209
01:46:44,477 --> 01:46:46,980
No, that's all right, put it in.

1210
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:48,942
I've no false pride.

1211
01:46:52,073 --> 01:46:53,867
Sit down, have a drink.

1212
01:46:54,076 --> 01:46:57,707
Thank you, old man, not during
office hours. But I'll sit down.

1213
01:47:01,255 --> 01:47:02,214
May I?

1214
01:47:09,518 --> 01:47:10,769
How are you?

1215
01:47:10,979 --> 01:47:12,522
Never felt better in my life!

1216
01:47:12,732 --> 01:47:14,943
And how is the army treating you?

1217
01:47:15,237 --> 01:47:16,822
Not so bad.

1218
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:19,534
I get up to London every other week.

1219
01:47:22,248 --> 01:47:23,791
Have you seen Terry?

1220
01:47:27,464 --> 01:47:28,382
How is she?

1221
01:47:29,343 --> 01:47:30,886
After you left she was quite ill.

1222
01:47:31,096 --> 01:47:32,681
But she's all right now?

1223
01:47:33,391 --> 01:47:37,146
She's been touring the continent.
Since she got back she's much better.

1224
01:47:39,443 --> 01:47:40,402
Good.

1225
01:47:41,529 --> 01:47:43,198
She never told me
what happened between you.

1226
01:47:45,411 --> 01:47:47,497
What could happen,
but the inevitable?

1227
01:47:50,002 --> 01:47:51,671
You see a great deal of her?

1228
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:59,476
Good.

1229
01:47:59,810 --> 01:48:02,105
Somehow I knew
it would work out that way.

1230
01:48:03,149 --> 01:48:05,235
Time is the great author.

1231
01:48:05,445 --> 01:48:07,322
It always writes
the perfect ending.

1232
01:48:12,331 --> 01:48:13,666
Great Scott!

1233
01:48:13,875 --> 01:48:15,544
How do you do, Mr. Postant?

1234
01:48:16,797 --> 01:48:19,926
Just a moment.
You're just the man I want to see.

1235
01:48:20,553 --> 01:48:22,347
Would you like to contribute?

1236
01:48:22,556 --> 01:48:24,225
Are you with that outfit outside?

1237
01:48:24,434 --> 01:48:25,770
I am, sir.

1238
01:48:27,022 --> 01:48:28,191
Oh, thank you.

1239
01:48:28,399 --> 01:48:30,360
You oughtn't to be doing this!

1240
01:48:30,569 --> 01:48:34,241
Why not? All the world's a stage.

1241
01:48:35,076 --> 01:48:37,371
And this one is the most legitimate.

1242
01:48:37,581 --> 01:48:42,172
I must go, or my confreres will
think I've run off with the takings.

1243
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:46,012
Thank you, gentlemen.

1244
01:48:46,972 --> 01:48:49,476
Don't you think
I should tell Terry I've seen you?

1245
01:48:49,684 --> 01:48:53,314
Knowing I'm doing this sort of thing
might upset her.

1246
01:48:53,524 --> 01:48:54,901
Although I don't mind it.

1247
01:48:55,110 --> 01:48:57,822
There's something
about working the streets I like.

1248
01:48:58,032 --> 01:48:59,993
It's the tramp in me, I suppose.

1249
01:49:00,202 --> 01:49:03,457
Wait a minute. Why don't you
come and see me at my office?

1250
01:49:03,666 --> 01:49:04,792
- What about?
- Business.

1251
01:49:05,127 --> 01:49:08,674
I never discuss business,
I leave that to my agent. Call him up.

1252
01:49:09,091 --> 01:49:11,678
However I'm booked up solid,
you know.

1253
01:49:12,097 --> 01:49:13,682
Au revoir, Gentlemen.

1254
01:49:25,786 --> 01:49:28,791
Driver, stop!
Please, turn around.

1255
01:49:38,808 --> 01:49:40,394
Keep the change.

1256
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:52,079
Cyrano de Bergerac,
without the nose.

1257
01:49:54,166 --> 01:49:55,502
Let's sit down.

1258
01:50:10,443 --> 01:50:12,112
So they told you, huh?

1259
01:50:13,657 --> 01:50:16,161
I've been searching
all over London for you.

1260
01:50:17,956 --> 01:50:19,708
The same Terry.

1261
01:50:21,294 --> 01:50:22,755
Am I?

1262
01:50:24,717 --> 01:50:26,721
A little more grown up, that's all.

1263
01:50:27,847 --> 01:50:29,850
I don't want to grow up.

1264
01:50:31,603 --> 01:50:33,189
None of us do.

1265
01:50:34,024 --> 01:50:36,110
But I had to, after you left.

1266
01:50:40,786 --> 01:50:44,750
It's all for the best.
All for the best.

1267
01:50:46,128 --> 01:50:47,463
Perhaps.

1268
01:50:49,257 --> 01:50:50,718
I don't know.

1269
01:50:52,888 --> 01:50:54,682
But something's gone.

1270
01:50:56,227 --> 01:50:57,896
Gone forever.

1271
01:50:59,483 --> 01:51:01,027
Nothing's gone,

1272
01:51:01,778 --> 01:51:03,447
it only changes.

1273
01:51:04,992 --> 01:51:06,369
I still love you.

1274
01:51:06,995 --> 01:51:08,539
Of course you do.

1275
01:51:09,583 --> 01:51:11,169
You always will.

1276
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:15,217
Calvero, come back.

1277
01:51:16,594 --> 01:51:18,556
You've got to come back!

1278
01:51:19,516 --> 01:51:23,271
I can't.
I must go forward.

1279
01:51:24,607 --> 01:51:25,984
That's progress.

1280
01:51:26,403 --> 01:51:28,364
Then let me go with you.

1281
01:51:29,741 --> 01:51:32,663
I'll do everything in the world
to make you happy.

1282
01:51:34,625 --> 01:51:38,089
That's what hurts.
I know you will.

1283
01:51:41,511 --> 01:51:44,348
Mr. Postant said
he'd give you a benefit.

1284
01:51:45,059 --> 01:51:46,936
I don't want his charity.

1285
01:51:47,897 --> 01:51:49,858
It isn't charity.

1286
01:51:50,066 --> 01:51:53,530
He says it'd be the greatest
event in theatrical history.

1287
01:51:53,948 --> 01:51:56,327
I'm not interested in events.

1288
01:51:57,496 --> 01:52:00,500
But I would like a chance just
to show them I'm not through yet.

1289
01:52:00,710 --> 01:52:02,086
Of course.

1290
01:52:03,339 --> 01:52:05,425
I've still got ideas, you know.

1291
01:52:06,052 --> 01:52:10,642
I've been working on,
working on... a comedy act,

1292
01:52:10,851 --> 01:52:12,728
for myself and my friend.

1293
01:52:13,147 --> 01:52:14,816
It's sort of a musical satire.

1294
01:52:15,025 --> 01:52:16,068
Wonderful!

1295
01:52:16,277 --> 01:52:20,534
You know he's a very good pianist,
and me with the violin...

1296
01:52:21,494 --> 01:52:24,290
A lot of very really
really very funny business.

1297
01:52:36,518 --> 01:52:37,562
Come in.

1298
01:52:42,362 --> 01:52:44,741
Sit down, my dear.
You look tired.

1299
01:52:45,492 --> 01:52:48,913
I've been working with the claque,
going over Calvero's jokes.

1300
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:52,044
I gave them cue sheets so
they'll know exactly where to laugh.

1301
01:52:52,253 --> 01:52:54,340
Are the jokes as bad as all that?

1302
01:52:54,966 --> 01:52:59,473
I'm worried. If he fails tonight,
it'll kill him. I know it.

1303
01:52:59,682 --> 01:53:03,437
He won't fail. The audience
will be most sympathetic.

1304
01:53:03,647 --> 01:53:06,443
But he doesn't want sympathy.
He keeps saying that.

1305
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:09,155
He wants to be a genuine success.

1306
01:53:09,365 --> 01:53:14,080
What does he expect?
You know he's not the man he was.

1307
01:53:14,582 --> 01:53:16,042
He mustn't be told that!

1308
01:53:17,212 --> 01:53:19,089
Tell me, my dear,

1309
01:53:19,506 --> 01:53:23,262
are you still going to marry him?

1310
01:53:25,141 --> 01:53:27,310
I'll do anything in the world
to make him happy.

1311
01:53:27,646 --> 01:53:29,523
He's a very lucky man.

1312
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:33,571
He's a very, very lucky man.

1313
01:53:35,449 --> 01:53:37,661
I never thought we'd come to this.

1314
01:53:38,163 --> 01:53:41,292
Here we have the star dressing room
without a dresser.

1315
01:53:42,461 --> 01:53:45,383
Oh well, I guess we can put up
with it for one night.

1316
01:53:45,675 --> 01:53:47,052
Fred, the stage manager.

1317
01:53:47,261 --> 01:53:48,387
Come in, Fred.

1318
01:53:50,057 --> 01:53:52,894
Like old times,
seeing you in this room again.

1319
01:53:53,313 --> 01:53:54,773
What's on your mind?

1320
01:53:54,983 --> 01:53:58,947
You've got 10 minutes, because
there's 20 other acts to follow.

1321
01:53:59,657 --> 01:54:02,787
You're in a song first,
finishing up with a musical act.

1322
01:54:03,121 --> 01:54:05,082
I'll ring down
after you fall in the drum.

1323
01:54:05,291 --> 01:54:07,295
No, after I'm carried off
in the drum.

1324
01:54:07,503 --> 01:54:09,255
Right you are. Thank you, sir.

1325
01:54:11,969 --> 01:54:16,267
If anybody else says it's like old
times, I'll jump out the window!

1326
01:54:16,559 --> 01:54:20,023
First the doorman,
then the call boy,

1327
01:54:20,441 --> 01:54:22,110
now the stage manager.

1328
01:54:22,403 --> 01:54:23,654
It's me, Postant.

1329
01:54:24,197 --> 01:54:28,454
It's like old times seeing you here
again putting on your war paint.

1330
01:54:29,414 --> 01:54:31,918
I'll be down
watching the other acts.

1331
01:54:32,628 --> 01:54:37,552
Yes, like old times.
Only in those days you were drunk.

1332
01:54:37,844 --> 01:54:39,430
I'm supposed to be funnier
when I'm drunk.

1333
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:41,601
Maybe, but you were killing yourself.

1334
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:44,856
You know, anything for a laugh.
How's the house?

1335
01:54:45,066 --> 01:54:47,987
Packed. Every face card in Europe
is out there:

1336
01:54:48,195 --> 01:54:50,490
kings, queens, jacks...

1337
01:54:50,699 --> 01:54:53,495
- Is Neville out there?
- Yes. Came up specially.

1338
01:54:53,913 --> 01:54:55,916
And what a program!

1339
01:54:56,125 --> 01:54:59,965
Take a look at that. Every star
in the business is appearing.

1340
01:55:00,382 --> 01:55:02,469
It'll be something,
following all this talent.

1341
01:55:02,678 --> 01:55:06,642
Don't worry. Tonight you'll
make them look like amateurs.

1342
01:55:06,851 --> 01:55:08,938
That's all any of us are. Amateurs.

1343
01:55:09,147 --> 01:55:11,859
We don't live long enough
to be anything else.

1344
01:55:13,446 --> 01:55:16,660
Well, as one old amateur
to another...

1345
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:20,123
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Mr. Postant.

1346
01:55:48,712 --> 01:55:49,755
Come in.

1347
01:55:54,431 --> 01:55:55,891
How do I look?

1348
01:55:56,725 --> 01:55:57,977
Funny.

1349
01:55:58,312 --> 01:56:01,317
I know what you're thinking,
my health and all that.

1350
01:56:01,942 --> 01:56:03,819
But I had to take a drink.

1351
01:56:04,363 --> 01:56:07,785
There's a creamy white light
turning off and on in my stomach.

1352
01:56:07,994 --> 01:56:11,333
And that's not so good,
if I'm to be a success tonight.

1353
01:56:11,542 --> 01:56:13,003
Is it really worth it?

1354
01:56:13,211 --> 01:56:16,132
Not that I care for success,
but I don't want another failure.

1355
01:56:16,342 --> 01:56:19,889
Whatever happens, there's always
that little home in the country.

1356
01:56:20,641 --> 01:56:22,810
This is my home. Here.

1357
01:56:23,354 --> 01:56:25,023
I thought you hated the theatre.

1358
01:56:25,231 --> 01:56:30,030
I do. I also hate the sight of blood
but it's in my veins.

1359
01:56:31,492 --> 01:56:32,535
Come in.

1360
01:56:33,787 --> 01:56:35,749
Mr. Calvero, on the stage please!

1361
01:56:36,166 --> 01:56:39,003
Good luck, sir.
They're all waiting for you.

1362
01:56:39,922 --> 01:56:41,091
Thanks.

1363
01:56:45,348 --> 01:56:46,933
I don't like it.

1364
01:56:47,768 --> 01:56:50,355
Everyone's so kind to me.

1365
01:56:50,565 --> 01:56:52,442
Makes me feel isolated.

1366
01:56:56,116 --> 01:56:58,495
Even you make me feel isolated.

1367
01:56:59,037 --> 01:57:00,914
Why do you say that?

1368
01:57:02,585 --> 01:57:04,046
I don't know.

1369
01:57:05,172 --> 01:57:07,049
I really don't know.

1370
01:57:10,306 --> 01:57:13,102
- Oh, your change.
- No, no.

1371
01:57:13,310 --> 01:57:14,687
Of course!

1372
01:57:18,111 --> 01:57:20,322
All right, turn it off up there!

1373
01:57:24,997 --> 01:57:26,791
Your change is all ready.

1374
01:57:28,127 --> 01:57:30,004
Good luck, my darling.

1375
01:57:31,257 --> 01:57:33,969
- Aren't you going to watch?
- I can't.

1376
01:57:34,179 --> 01:57:35,556
But remember I love you.

1377
01:57:36,391 --> 01:57:37,517
Really?

1378
01:57:37,726 --> 01:57:40,648
Always. With all my heart.

1379
01:57:40,857 --> 01:57:42,108
Ready, Mr. Calvero?

1380
01:57:42,318 --> 01:57:43,986
Good luck, my darling.

1381
01:57:45,239 --> 01:57:46,615
Let her go!

1382
01:57:54,630 --> 01:57:58,302
<i>I'm an animal trainer
A circus entertainer</i>

1383
01:57:58,511 --> 01:58:02,266
<i>I've trained animals by the score
Lions, tigers and wild boar</i>

1384
01:58:15,832 --> 01:58:17,501
That's not Phyllis!

1385
01:58:28,019 --> 01:58:29,479
Where's Phyllis?

1386
01:58:33,444 --> 01:58:34,612
There she is!

1387
01:59:40,763 --> 01:59:43,142
<i>When I was three
My nurse told me</i>

1388
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,481
<i>About reincarnation</i>

1389
01:59:47,316 --> 01:59:49,736
<i>And ever since
I've been convinced</i>

1390
01:59:50,029 --> 01:59:52,032
<i>Thrilled with anticipation</i>

1391
01:59:52,325 --> 01:59:54,619
<i>That when I leave this earth</i>

1392
01:59:54,828 --> 01:59:56,915
<i>It makes my heart feel warm</i>

1393
01:59:57,249 --> 01:59:59,126
<i>To know that I'll return</i>

1394
01:59:59,628 --> 02:00:01,631
<i>In some other form</i>

1395
02:00:02,049 --> 02:00:06,221
<i>But I don't want to be a tree</i>

1396
02:00:06,432 --> 02:00:08,100
<i>Sticking in the ground</i>

1397
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:09,770
<i>I'd sooner be a flea</i>

1398
02:00:09,979 --> 02:00:12,065
<i>I don't want to be a flower</i>

1399
02:00:12,274 --> 02:00:13,943
<i>Waiting by the hour</i>

1400
02:00:14,152 --> 02:00:17,157
<i>Hoping for a pollen to alight on me</i>

1401
02:00:17,366 --> 02:00:20,496
<i>So when I cease to be</i>

1402
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:24,252
<i>I want to go back
I want to go back to the sea</i>

1403
02:00:24,461 --> 02:00:27,925
<i>Oh for the life of a sardine
That is the life for me</i>

1404
02:00:28,134 --> 02:00:30,096
<i>Cavorting and spawning
every morning</i>

1405
02:00:30,304 --> 02:00:31,680
<i>Under the deep blue sea</i>

1406
02:00:31,891 --> 02:00:35,521
<i>To have no fear for storm or gale
Oh to chase the tail of a whale</i>

1407
02:00:35,730 --> 02:00:37,316
<i>Oh for the life of a sardine</i>

1408
02:00:37,524 --> 02:00:39,276
<i>That is the life for me</i>

1409
02:00:47,959 --> 02:00:49,420
You're 3 minutes over!

1410
02:00:49,628 --> 02:00:50,671
It's the audience.

1411
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:52,006
Bow and finish.

1412
02:00:52,216 --> 02:00:53,259
I've another act to do.

1413
02:00:53,467 --> 02:00:55,470
Bow and finish!

1414
02:01:15,087 --> 02:01:16,005
What am I to do?

1415
02:01:16,214 --> 02:01:19,051
Just finish.
There are 15 other acts to follow.

1416
02:01:26,564 --> 02:01:29,276
Look, I've got Postant
on the telephone!

1417
02:01:31,238 --> 02:01:33,867
Please, please.
Will you give me a chance?

1418
02:01:34,076 --> 02:01:36,371
What's wrong?
Why isn't he doing an encore?

1419
02:01:36,664 --> 02:01:39,084
I can't keep the other acts waiting.
They're complaining.

1420
02:01:39,377 --> 02:01:42,006
That's your problem.
He does an encore.

1421
02:01:52,023 --> 02:01:53,483
Do your encore!

1422
02:08:22,879 --> 02:08:24,840
Mmm, you darling!

1423
02:09:58,245 --> 02:09:59,914
- Here, take this.
- What is it?

1424
02:10:00,124 --> 02:10:03,045
I have a terrific pain
in my back and chest.

1425
02:10:03,254 --> 02:10:05,340
Dr. Blake is in the house.
Shall I get him?

1426
02:10:05,550 --> 02:10:06,885
Yes, get him at once!

1427
02:10:07,093 --> 02:10:09,097
- What's wrong?
- He's hurt his spine.

1428
02:10:09,306 --> 02:10:11,183
- Did you send for the doctor?
- Yes.

1429
02:10:11,893 --> 02:10:13,479
Then carry him
to his dressing room.

1430
02:10:13,688 --> 02:10:16,192
I'll tell the audience
there's been an accident.

1431
02:10:16,401 --> 02:10:18,362
No, don't do that!
Carry me on.

1432
02:10:18,571 --> 02:10:21,200
I'll talk to them.
You'll ruin the evening.

1433
02:10:38,395 --> 02:10:43,528
On behalf of my partner,
and myself...

1434
02:10:45,825 --> 02:10:48,119
This is a wonderful evening.

1435
02:10:48,413 --> 02:10:51,667
I'd like to continue,
but I'm stuck.

1436
02:11:09,489 --> 02:11:11,074
Take off his makeup.

1437
02:11:11,284 --> 02:11:12,619
Is there a couch
in his dressing room?

1438
02:11:12,827 --> 02:11:14,413
No, but there's one
in the prop room.

1439
02:11:14,622 --> 02:11:15,749
Take him in there.

1440
02:11:15,958 --> 02:11:18,169
Everyone else must wait outside.

1441
02:11:26,392 --> 02:11:30,774
Where's Calvero?
Where is the old scoundrel?

1442
02:11:31,526 --> 02:11:34,447
I want to congratulate him.
Where's Calvero?

1443
02:11:34,655 --> 02:11:37,034
In the prop room.
He's had an accident.

1444
02:11:38,286 --> 02:11:39,747
Here's the doctor now.

1445
02:11:40,081 --> 02:11:41,750
I want an ambulance at once.

1446
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:43,003
Is it serious, Doctor?

1447
02:11:43,211 --> 02:11:45,297
Very. It isn't his back,
it's a heart attack.

1448
02:11:45,591 --> 02:11:47,677
- Is he in pain?
- Not now. I've given him something.

1449
02:11:47,885 --> 02:11:49,262
I'm afraid he won't last the night.

1450
02:12:03,537 --> 02:12:05,123
What have they been telling you?

1451
02:12:05,331 --> 02:12:07,083
Are you all right?

1452
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:09,170
Of course.

1453
02:12:10,548 --> 02:12:12,092
I'm an old weed.

1454
02:12:13,261 --> 02:12:16,266
The more I'm cut down,
the more I spring up again.

1455
02:12:18,896 --> 02:12:20,147
Did you hear them?

1456
02:12:23,487 --> 02:12:25,239
I don't mean the claque.

1457
02:12:25,448 --> 02:12:26,616
Wonderful!

1458
02:12:27,451 --> 02:12:29,413
That's how it used to be.

1459
02:12:31,208 --> 02:12:33,795
That's how it's going to be
from now on.

1460
02:12:37,259 --> 02:12:39,346
We're going to tour the world.

1461
02:12:41,725 --> 02:12:43,393
I've got ideas.

1462
02:12:44,355 --> 02:12:48,319
You doing ballet, and me comedy.

1463
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:57,292
And in the elegant melancholy
of twilight,

1464
02:12:59,254 --> 02:13:00,922
he will tell you he loves you.

1465
02:13:01,758 --> 02:13:05,305
It doesn't matter.
It's you I love.

1466
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:10,230
The heart and the mind...
what an enigma.

1467
02:13:11,692 --> 02:13:14,613
Miss Thereza, you're on, please.

1468
02:13:19,412 --> 02:13:21,499
I won't be long, my darling.

1469
02:13:34,646 --> 02:13:36,607
I believe I'm dying, Doctor.

1470
02:13:38,194 --> 02:13:42,659
But then, I don't know.
I've died so many times.

1471
02:13:43,076 --> 02:13:44,745
Are you in pain?

1472
02:13:45,915 --> 02:13:47,166
No more.

1473
02:13:51,132 --> 02:13:52,467
Where is she?

1474
02:13:54,137 --> 02:13:55,931
I want to see her dance.

1475
02:13:57,392 --> 02:13:58,727
Wait a minute.

1476
02:14:13,252 --> 02:14:15,213
Bring the couch into the wings.

1477
02:14:16,381 --> 02:14:18,139
I must see about that ambulance.

1478
02:14:19,305 --> 02:15:19,682

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,840
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

3
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
I want mead!

4
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,600
Give me some mead, my Queen!

5
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,600
Thank you, my beautiful Queen.

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,520
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

7
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,840
This is how it works, Aesher.

8
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,400
After you die,
you wouldn't really be dead

9
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,200
providing you have accepted him
as the one and only God.

10
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,120
All right, back! Back!

11
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,240
Here, my beauty, give me a kiss.

12
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,040
I want a kiss! Give me a kiss!
I want a kiss!

13
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,240
Please, stop it!

14
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,080
More!

15
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,760
My thanes, my beautiful thanes!

16
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,000
One year ago, I, Hrothgar, your King

17
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,800
swore that we would
celebrate our victories

18
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,240
in a new hall, mighty and beautiful!

19
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,280
Have I not kept my oath? Yeah.

20
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,360
In this hall, we shall divide
the spoils of our conquests,

21
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,640
the gold and the treasure.

22
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,640
And this shall be a place of merriment,
joy, and fornication!

23
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,920
From now until the end of time,
I name this hall Herot!

24
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,560
Treasure!
Let's hand out some treasure!

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,440
Give me some of that!

26
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,160
From my conquests!

27
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,600
Unferth!

28
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,080
For Unferth, for Unferth,
my wisest advisor,

29
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,120
violator of virgins
and best and bravest of brave brawlers.

30
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,920
Unferth, where the hell are you,
you weasel-faced bastard?

31
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm here, my King.

32
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,640
Unferth, come here, you ungrateful lout!

33
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,720
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

34
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,640
<i>He faced a demon dragon
When other men would freeze</i>

35
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,480
<i>And then, my lords, he took his sword
And brought it to its knees...</i>

36
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,280
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

37
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,880
<i>The greatest of our kings</i>

38
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
<i>He broke the dragon's wings</i>

39
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,120
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

40
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,920
<i>The kingdom fell in darkness
And shadows ruled the night</i>

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,760
<i>With no sign of dawn, he soldiered on
And brought us back to life</i>

42
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,560
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

43
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,480
<i>He never shook your faith</i>

44
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,200
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

45
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,920
<i>Let every cup be raised</i>

46
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,080
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

47
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,200
<i>He offered us protection
When monsters roamed the land</i>

48
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,320
<i>And one by one, he took them on
They perished at his hand</i>

49
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,120
Mead!

50
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,520
Mead!

51
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,720
Mead!

52
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,480
You're spilling it. Where's my mead?
You're spilling it.

53
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,280
You're spilling it!

54
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Cain, you clumsy idiot!

55
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,760
How dare you waste the King's mead?

56
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,800
<i>He rose up like a savior
When every hope was gone</i>

57
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,800
<i>The beast was gored
and peace restored</i>

58
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,640
<i>His memory will live on</i>

59
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,360
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

60
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,480
<i>Let every cup be raised</i>

61
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

62
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,880
<i>Now and forever</i>

63
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,200
A sword! Give me a sword!

64
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,040
Come! Arm yourselves!

65
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,760
Stay down, my Lady!

66
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
- Give me a sword! A sword!
- My Lord!

67
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,960
No!

68
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,720
Fight me!

69
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,400
Fight me!

70
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,680
Fight me.

71
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
You fight me, damn you.

72
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,080
Nay.

73
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,680
What was that?

74
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,000
Grendel.

75
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,640
Grendel, what have you done?

76
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,880
<i>What hafast flu done, Grendel?</i>

77
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,960
Fish and wolf and bear

78
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,960
and sheep or two,

79
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,160
<i>ac nan men.</i>

80
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,080
Men, Grendel.

81
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,080
They have slain so many of our kind.

82
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,640
Was Hrothgar there?

83
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,320
Good.

84
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,200
Good boy.

85
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,040
And tender.

86
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Men, build another pyre!

87
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,240
There's dry wood behind the stables.

88
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,240
Then burn the dead.

89
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,800
And seal the hall!
Close the doors and the windows.

90
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,520
And by the King's order,

91
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,880
there should be no singing
or merrymaking of any kind.

92
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,960
This place reeks of death.

93
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,480
The scops are singing
the shame of Herot

94
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,080
as far south as the middle kingdom
and as far north as the ice-lands.

95
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,240
I've let it be known that
I will give half the gold in my kingdom

96
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,720
to any man who can rid us of Grendel.

97
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,440
My King, for deliverance

98
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,040
our people sacrifice goats and sheep
to Odin and Heimdall.

99
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,080
With your permission,

100
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,480
shall we also pray
to the new Roman god, Christ Jesus?

101
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,280
Perhaps he can lift our affliction.

102
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,120
No, Unferth, no.

103
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,520
No, the gods will do nothing for us
that we will not do for ourselves.

104
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,160
What we need is a hero.

105
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,160
Hold your oars up!

106
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,200
And heave!

107
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,000
Can you see the coast?
Can you see the Danes' guide-fire?

108
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,160
I see nothing but the wind and the rain!

109
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,120
No fire, no stars by which to navigate.

110
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,920
We're lost! Given to the sea!

111
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,560
The sea's my mother!

112
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,520
She'll never take me back
to her murky womb.

113
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,120
My mother was a fishwife in Uppland.

114
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,560
I was rather hoping to die in battle
as a warrior should!

115
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,400
Heave!

116
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,960
The men are worried
the storm has no end, Beowulf.

117
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,040
It's no earthly storm,
that much is for sure.

118
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,320
But this demon's tempest
will not hold us out

119
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,000
if we really want in!

120
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,880
Who wants to live?

121
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,400
We do!

122
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,040
Then pull your oars! Let's see you do it!

123
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,960
For Beowulf!

124
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,800
For gold!

125
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,160
For glory!

126
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,040
Heave! Heave!

127
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,440
Heave! Heave!

128
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,640
Beowulf.

129
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,200
Hold fast!

130
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,880
No.

131
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,000
Who are you?
From your dress, you are warriors.

132
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,520
Speak! Why should I
not run you through right now?

133
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,000
We are Geats.

134
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,600
I am Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow.

135
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,880
We come seeking your Prince Hrothgar
in friendship.

136
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,840
They say you have a monster here?

137
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,240
They say your lands are cursed.

138
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
Is that what they say?

139
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,120
Bards sing of Hrothgar's shame

140
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,600
from the frozen North
to the shores of Vinland.

141
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,440
There's no shame
to be accursed by demons!

142
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,640
I am Beowulf!
And I am here to kill your monster.

143
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,840
I thought there were no more heroes
foolish enough

144
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,240
to come around here
and die for our gold.

145
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,040
If we die, it'll be for glory, not for gold.

146
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,720
My Lord?

147
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,080
My Lord?
There are warriors outside. Geats.

148
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,440
But they are no beggars,

149
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,080
and their leader Beowulf
is an imposing...

150
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,360
Beowulf? Ecgtheow's little boy?

151
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,040
Beowulf. Where is he? Where?

152
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,720
There you are.
Beowulf, welcome, my boy.

153
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,880
Welcome. Yes. How's your father?

154
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,280
Dead.

155
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,280
Died in battle with sea-raiders
two winters back.

156
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,280
Well, he was a brave man.

157
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,080
May I ask why you have come to us
from across the sea?

158
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,280
I've come to kill your monster.

159
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,680
And to taste that famous mead of yours.

160
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,920
There have been many brave men
who have come to taste my Lord's mead

161
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,040
and many who have sworn
to rid his hall of our nightmare.

162
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,640
But in the morning,
there was nothing left of any of them

163
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,320
but blood to be cleaned from the floor

164
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,800
and the benches, and the walls.

165
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,000
I have drunk nothing, yet.

166
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,400
But I will kill your monster.

167
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,280
He will kill the monster.
Did you hear that? Grendel will die.

168
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,360
- Grendel?
- Yeah, the monster is called Grendel.

169
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,400
Then I will kill your Grendel.

170
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,520
I, Beowulf,
killed a tribe of giants on the Orkneys,

171
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,680
crushed the skulls of sea-serpents,

172
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,560
and this troll of yours
will trouble you no more.

173
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,200
A hero! A hero!
I knew the sea would bring us a hero!

174
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,480
So will you go up to the moors,
to the dark pool by the cave

175
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,400
and kill the monster in its den?

176
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,280
I have 14 brave thanes with me.
We have been long at sea.

177
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,200
It is high time, mighty Hrothgar,
to break open your golden mead

178
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,920
famed across the world

179
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,440
and to feast
in your legendary mead hall.

180
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,960
The mead hall has been sealed
by his Lord's order.

181
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,800
Merrymaking in the hall
brings the devil, Grendel.

182
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,880
Well, then.

183
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,440
Open the mead hall! Let's drink!

184
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,640
We don't want any trouble
with the locals.

185
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,720
Hondshew, make me feel
you're pretending to listen to me.

186
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,200
It's only been five days
since you waved your wife goodbye.

187
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,640
Five days? In the name of Odin,
no wonder my loins are burning!

188
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,920
Beowulf, there you are.

189
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,800
I was thinking about your father.
Great man.

190
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,120
He was fleeing the Wulfings

191
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,640
and he'd killed one of them
with his bare hands.

192
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,520
- Heatholaf.
- That's it, yeah. That's right.

193
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,200
I paid the blood debt for your father,
and he swore his oath to me.

194
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,120
So I saved his skin,
and you're here to save ours, that right?

195
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,480
All hail the great Beowulf,

196
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,080
come to save
our pathetic Danish skins, eh?

197
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,960
And we are so damned grateful,
mighty Beowulf.

198
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,720
But can I ask a question,
as a huge admirer of yours?

199
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,960
There was another Beowulf
I heard tell of

200
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,760
who challenged Brecca the Mighty to
a swimming race out on the open sea.

201
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,840
Was that you?

202
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,040
I swam against Brecca.

203
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Because I thought
it had to be a different Beowulf,

204
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,720
someone else of the same name.

205
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,040
Because, you see,
the Beowulf I heard of

206
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,600
swam against Brecca and lost.

207
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,280
He risked his life and Brecca's

208
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,640
to serve his own vanity and pride.

209
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,160
A boastful fool.

210
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,040
And he lost!

211
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,720
So I thought it had to be someone else.

212
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,280
I swam against Brecca.

213
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,160
But victory was his, not yours.

214
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,160
A mighty warrior who cannot even
win a swimming match!

215
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,800
Speaking only for myself here,

216
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,480
not only do I doubt that you will be
able to stand for a moment

217
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,080
against Grendel,

218
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I doubt that you will even have the belly
to stay in the hall all night.

219
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,560
I find it difficult to argue with a drunk.

220
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,480
But it's true, I did not win the race.

221
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,760
<i>We swam for five days, neck and neck.</i>

222
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,680
<i>I was conserving my strength
for the final stretch</i>

223
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,560
<i>when this storm blew up</i>

224
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,280
<i>and with it came sea monsters.</i>

225
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,160
<i>Again and again, the monsters attacked!</i>

226
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,720
<i>Dark things from the sea's depths.</i>

227
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,560
<i>I hacked and I lashed
at these foul beasts with my sword,</i>

228
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,080
<i>spilling their guts into the sea.</i>

229
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,600
Beowulf!

230
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,560
Then one of them seized me by its jaws

231
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,240
<i>and dragged me to the bottom.</i>

232
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,960
<i>I killed the monster with my own blade</i>

233
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,200
and I plunged it into its heart.

234
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,280
Yes, of course. The sea monsters.

235
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,600
And you killed, what was it? 20?

236
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,960
Nine.

237
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,240
Last time it were three.

238
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,080
But would you do me the honor
of telling me your name?

239
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,520
I am Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

240
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,840
Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

241
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,480
I know who you are.

242
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,080
They say you killed both your brothers

243
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,800
when you witnessed them
having knowledge of your mother.

244
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,200
I have another true thing to tell you,
Unferth Kinslayer.

245
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,480
If your strength and heart
was as strong and fierce as your words,

246
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,760
Grendel would not feel free to murder
and gorge on your people

247
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,080
without fear of retaliation.

248
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,360
Tonight will be different!

249
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,160
Tonight, he will find Geats waiting
for him, not frightened sheep

250
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,360
like you.

251
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,680
Well done!

252
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,480
That's the spirit, Beowulf.
That's the spirit we need.

253
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,480
So you will kill my Grendel for me,
will you?

254
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,200
Well, let's all drink in celebration
of the kill that is to come.

255
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,960
<i>Lips ripe as the berries in June</i>

256
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,880
<i>Red the rose, red the rose</i>

257
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,080
<i>Skin pale as the light of the moon</i>

258
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,640
<i>Gently as she goes</i>

259
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,960
<i>Eyes blue as the sea and the sky</i>

260
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,360
Beowulf. Come.

261
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,360
<i>Water flows, water flows</i>

262
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,360
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

263
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,400
<i>Heart burning like fire in the night</i>

264
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,840
<i>Gently as she goes</i>

265
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,720
Come.

266
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,280
There.

267
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,160
The Royal Dragon Horn.

268
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,880
It is beautiful.

269
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,920
Isn't it magnificent?

270
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,320
She's the prize of my treasure.

271
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,200
I claimed her after my battle with Fafnir,
the dragon of the Northern moors.

272
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,320
Nearly cost me my life.

273
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,480
And there's a soft spot
under the throat, there.

274
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,840
See? You have to go in
with a knife or a dagger.

275
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,280
It's the only way you can kill a dragon.

276
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,400
I wonder how many men
have died for love of her beauty.

277
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,200
Can you blame them?

278
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,640
If you destroy my Grendel for me,

279
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,400
she'll be yours forever
and ever and ever.

280
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,720
You do me great honor.

281
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,360
It is we who are honored.

282
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,720
Is that your demon?

283
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,400
That was a wolf.
You don't hear Grendel when he comes.

284
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,280
No? Well, you'll hear me, I promise.

285
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,200
Come on, my mighty lust limb
can transport you to paradise,

286
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,720
to ecstasy and back.

287
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,600
No other man
will ever be able to satisfy you again.

288
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,320
- Sorry.
- Come on!

289
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,720
- I said no and I meant no.
- Why not?

290
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,960
Because it's late and it's dark and the
monster could arrive at any moment!

291
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,640
Well, then, how about a quick gobble?

292
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,800
The hour is upon us.

293
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,960
This old man needs his sleep.

294
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,360
Where's my beautiful bedmate?
Come, my love.

295
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,200
In a moment.

296
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,120
Come, Wealthow,
let us pound the pillows.

297
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,440
Don't touch me!

298
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,280
That's the spirit, my girl.

299
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,280
My Lord!

300
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,600
Perhaps Her Majesty
could grace our ears

301
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,080
with one more melody
before we all retire?

302
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,080
It's the least I can do.

303
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,400
Beowulf, I'll hope to see you
in the morning, Odin willing.

304
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,120
And make sure
your thanes secure the doors.

305
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,960
Good night. Good night.

306
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,080
Good night, Beowulf.
Watch out for sea monsters.

307
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,840
I'm sure your imagination
must be teeming with them.

308
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,880
<i>Just wait</i>

309
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,760
<i>Though wide he may roam</i>

310
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,160
<i>Always a hero comes home</i>

311
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:04,160
<i>He goes where no one has gone</i>

312
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,960
<i>But always a hero comes home</i>

313
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,600
<i>He goes where no one has gone</i>

314
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,920
<i>But always a hero comes home</i>

315
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,280
That was beautiful.

316
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,000
You need to go now, Your Majesty.

317
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,800
Of course. Grendel.

318
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,360
The demon is my husband's shame.

319
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,960
It's not a shame, it's a curse.

320
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,480
No, shame.

321
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,760
My husband has no other. No sons.

322
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,440
And he will have no more,
for all his talk.

323
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,480
Oy, Hondshew. How was she?

324
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,320
Nah. Not my type.

325
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,240
I know your type.

326
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,320
Lord Beowulf, what are you doing?

327
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,120
The creature has no sword, no armor.

328
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,600
And I have no weapon
capable of slaying a monster.

329
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,800
We shall fight as equals.

330
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,800
And fate

331
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,560
shall decide.

332
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,880
Good. Tie it off with more chain.

333
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,360
Enough frican' about!

334
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,880
You're mad, you know that?

335
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,320
Yes.

336
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,560
Something vexes you, my Wiglaf?

337
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,040
I don't like the smell of this one,
my Lord.

338
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,080
The men are unprepared.

339
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,400
They're distracted.

340
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,360
Too many untended women here!

341
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,160
Abstinence prior to battle is essential!

342
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,200
A warrior's mind must be unblurred,
my Lord.

343
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,000
Good night, Wiglaf.

344
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,040
And while you're sleeping,
what're we meant to do?

345
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,640
Sing! Loudly!

346
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,440
Well, you heard him.
He wants us to sing. So sing!

347
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,000
Olaf, sing!

348
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,040
<i>There was a dozen virgins</i>

349
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,880
<i>Friesians, Danes and Franks</i>

350
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,720
<i>We took them for some swifan
And all we got were wanks</i>

351
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,120
<i>Oh, we are Beowulf's army
Each a mighty thane</i>

352
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,800
<i>We'll pummel your asses
And ravage your lasses</i>

353
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,040
<i>Then do it all over again</i>

354
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,400
<i>The fattest of the virgins
I knew her for a whore</i>

355
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,680
<i>I gave her all my codpiece
And still she wanted more</i>

356
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,000
<i>Her sister was from Norway
She cost me 20 groats</i>

357
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,480
<i>She showed me there was more ways
Than one to sow my oats</i>

358
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,640
<i>Her mother was from Iceland
And she was mighty hot</i>

359
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,280
<i>She'd need a whole damn iceberg
To cool her burning...</i>

360
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,680
Grendel. He knocks.

361
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,520
That must be my sweet plum, Yrsa.

362
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,560
She's ready for me
to taste her juicy fruit.

363
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,640
My Lord.

364
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,200
Patience, patience, my love.

365
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,160
No! Hondshew! No!

366
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,280
Swife me! It's the frican' monster!

367
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,800
I swear, the bastard has no pintel!

368
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,960
- No pintel.
- Aye.

369
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,520
- The demon shrinks!
- It shrinks! It shrinks!

370
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,520
Demon!

371
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,160
Your bloodletting
days are finished, demon!

372
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,240
It speaks. It speaks!

373
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,080
I am ripper, tearer, slasher, gouger.

374
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,920
I am the teeth in the darkness,
the talons in the night.

375
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,240
Mine is strength and lust and power!

376
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,480
I am Beowulf!

377
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,040
Grendel's arm!

378
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,720
You've done it!

379
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,280
He's done it!

380
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,760
He's torn the limbs from the beast!
Beowulf has killed him!

381
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,560
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

382
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,240
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

383
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,240
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

384
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,040
My Lord, Beowulf has killed the demon!

385
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,480
Odin be praised.

386
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,280
- Go tell the scops. Spread the word!
- Yes, my Lord.

387
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,400
Tomorrow will be
a glorious day of rejoicing.

388
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,280
Our nightmare is over.

389
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,800
Come to bed, my sweet.

390
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,080
My kingdom needs an heir!
I need a son! It's time you did your duty.

391
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,720
How can I ever lay with you,
knowing you laid with her?

392
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,400
I should never have told you.

393
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
I should never have told you.

394
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
My poor son.

395
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,280
Sleep now, my son.

396
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,720
Who murdered you, my son?

397
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,760
<i>He will pay, meen darling.</i>

398
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,520
Beowulf.

399
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,880
They were great warriors.

400
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,320
They died a foul death.

401
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,800
They were murdered by a foul creature
from the depths of hell.

402
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,360
The bards
will sing of their glory forever.

403
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,360
Come, let us drink to their memory.

404
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,160
I want you to raise the first cup.

405
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,600
I am not in the mood for merrymaking.

406
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,760
I'll ride down to the mooring,
prepare the boat.

407
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,040
We still leave tomorrow, on the tide,
do we not?

408
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,120
Aye.

409
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,360
My thanes, my friends, brothers,

410
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,920
this place for me
has been a hall of sadness.

411
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,400
And for all of us,

412
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,960
it has been a place of misery,
bloodshed, and death.

413
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,960
But today,
the monster's reign has ended.

414
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,080
They say he ripped the monster's
limb off with his bare hands.

415
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,200
I wonder if Beowulf's strength is only
in his arms, or in his legs as well,

416
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,120
all three of them?

417
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,440
Well, after the feast tonight,
I'm sure you can find out, Gitte.

418
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,720
Me? It's not me he wants, my Queen.

419
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,240
Bring it here!

420
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,560
Wealthow, my love,

421
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,400
why don't you do the honors?

422
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,920
For you, my Lord.

423
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,880
Thank you, great King.

424
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,960
And all of you,

425
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,160
I wish you'd have been there last night
to see me kill the monster.

426
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,160
I was asleep when he arrived.

427
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,080
He ripped open the doors
with his bare hands.

428
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,240
He stood 20 feet tall,
possessing the strength of 10 men.

429
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,040
I looked at him and said,
"I am Beowulf!"

430
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,360
Brave thane.

431
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,600
My Queen.

432
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,400
I love you.

433
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,800
I want you, my King.

434
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,160
Only you.

435
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,200
<i>My hero, meen looviyend.</i>

436
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,000
I don't understand.

437
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,240
Where's your husband?

438
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,880
Dead.

439
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,760
Dead?

440
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,320
This is a dream.

441
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,440
This is not happening.
You're just a dream.

442
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,320
Me, darling? A dream?

443
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,320
Give me a child.
Enter me and give me a son!

444
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,800
In the name of Odin!

445
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,240
Is Grendel not dead?

446
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,280
Has he grown his arm anew?

447
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,560
It's not Grendel.

448
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,160
Not Grendel? Then who?

449
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,600
His mother.

450
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,240
It's Grendel you killed.

451
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,760
I had hoped his mother
had left the land long, long ago.

452
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,880
How many monsters must I slay?

453
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,280
Grendel's mother? Father?
Grendel's uncle?

454
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,640
Must I hack down
a whole family tree of demons?

455
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,000
She is the last of them.

456
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,320
With her gone,

457
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,880
demonkind will slip back
into the darkness from whence it came.

458
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,400
Where it belongs.

459
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,520
And the mother's mate?
Where is Grendel's father?

460
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,960
Grendel's father
can do no harm to man.

461
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,440
Beowulf,

462
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,880
I was wrong to doubt you before,
and I shall not again.

463
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,920
Yours is the blood of courage.
I beg your forgiveness.

464
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,680
Granted.

465
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,880
Cain! Cain!

466
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,960
Take my sword.
It belonged to my father's father.

467
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,280
It's called "Hrunting."

468
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,800
That sword is no match
for demon magic.

469
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,280
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

470
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,480
No, I'm sorry I mentioned
you murdered your brothers.

471
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,560
They were hasty words.

472
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,080
Unferth, I may not return.

473
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,760
Your ancestral sword
might be lost with me.

474
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,080
As long as it is with you,
it will never be lost.

475
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,680
And you, mighty Wiglaf,

476
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,400
are you still with me?

477
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,240
To the end.

478
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,320
Look.

479
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,080
She's probably a water demon.

480
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,120
You don't want to meet her
in her element.

481
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,360
I know.

482
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,400
Do you want me to go in with you?

483
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,000
Good.

484
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,560
I'll be here.

485
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,240
I see you've brought me treasure.

486
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,560
Show yourself!

487
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,480
What are you?

488
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,400
Are you the one they call Beowulf?

489
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,320
The Bee-Wolf.

490
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,400
The bear.

491
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,360
Such a strong man you are.

492
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,520
With the strength of a king.

493
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,320
The king you will one day become.

494
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,840
What do you know of me, demon?

495
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,040
I know that underneath your glamour

496
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:33,280
you're as much a monster
as my son, Grendel.

497
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,200
My glamour?

498
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,480
One needs glamour to become a king.

499
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,240
A man like you could own
the greatest tale ever sung.

500
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,160
Your story would live on

501
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,640
when everything now alive is dust.

502
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,000
Beowulf.

503
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,080
It has been a long time

504
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,760
since a man has come to visit me.

505
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,320
I need no sword to kill you.

506
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,400
Of course you don't, my love.

507
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,360
You took a son from me.

508
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,080
Give me a son, brave thane.

509
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,200
Stay with me.

510
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,960
Love me.

511
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,000
Love me

512
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:51,040
and I shall weave you riches
beyond imagination.

513
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,880
I shall make you

514
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:59,200
the greatest king that ever lived.

515
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,360
As long as you hold me in your heart

516
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,760
and this golden horn
remains in my keeping,

517
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,480
you will forever be king.

518
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,920
Forever strong,

519
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,680
mighty

520
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,360
and all powerful.

521
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,960
This I promise.

522
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,000
This I swear.

523
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,320
My Lord.

524
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,240
It's dead, my Lady.

525
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,840
When I finished off
Grendel's monstrous mother,

526
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,960
I severed the brute's head.

527
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,840
Our curse is lifted.

528
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,600
Our curse is lifted. Odin be praised!

529
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,480
Beowulf be praised!

530
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,360
Our curse is lifted.

531
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,880
Take this out of my sight. Unferth!

532
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,760
Into the sea, quickly.

533
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,560
I plunged Hrunting
into Grendel's mother's chest

534
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,400
and when I pulled the sword
free from her corpse,

535
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,920
the creature sprang back to life,

536
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,320
so I plunged the sword back into
the hag's chest and there it will stay.

537
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,480
Till Ragnarok, huh?

538
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,480
And our people shall be grateful
till the Ragnarok.

539
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,440
More mead, my Lord?

540
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,600
Aye.

541
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,040
And the drinking horn, do you have it?

542
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,880
No.

543
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,920
I knew the greedy witch desired it,
so I threw it into the swamp.

544
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,320
And when she followed,
that's where I struck,

545
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,800
with the mighty sword Hrunting.

546
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:34,000
When she was dead, I looked for it,
but it was gone forever.

547
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,800
Then find our hero another cup,
my love.

548
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,680
First, the hero and I must talk.

549
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,560
Beowulf.

550
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,920
So you brought back
the head of Grendel.

551
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,160
What about the head of the mother?

552
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,800
With her dead and cold in the bog,

553
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,160
is it not enough
to return one monster's head?

554
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,320
Did you kill her?

555
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:15,440
Would you like to hear the story of my
struggle against this monstrous hag?

556
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,880
She's no hag, Beowulf.
We both know that.

557
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,880
But answer me, did you kill her?

558
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:35,760
Would I have been able to escape her,
had I not?

559
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,600
Grendel is dead.
That's all that matters to me.

560
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,160
He can bother me no more.

561
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,760
The mother, "the hag,"
she's not my curse.

562
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,000
Not anymore.

563
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,960
Not anymore.

564
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,000
Listen to me!

565
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,840
Listen to me!

566
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,200
Because my Lord Beowulf
is a mighty hero

567
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,440
and because
he killed the demon Grendel

568
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,000
and laid its mother in her grave...

569
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,600
- To Beowulf!
- Long live Beowulf!

570
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,760
...and because I have no heir,

571
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,600
I have no sons,

572
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,320
I declare that on my death,

573
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,360
all that I possess, my kingdom,

574
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,320
my hall of sadness and shame,

575
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,640
and even my lovely young Queen,

576
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,160
my Wealthow,

577
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,400
everything, everything

578
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,280
I leave to this, our hero.

579
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,560
- But, my Lord...
- I have spoken!

580
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,800
I have spoken!

581
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,560
When I am gone,

582
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,960
Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow,
shall be king!

583
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,720
Beowulf!

584
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,640
My Lord.

585
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,400
Everything in its time, Beowulf.

586
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,720
Hrothgar!

587
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,600
He must have fallen.

588
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,400
- All hail King Beowulf.
- All hail King Beowulf.

589
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,720
All hail King Beowulf.

590
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,200
King Beowulf.

591
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,520
Archers.

592
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,320
Archers!

593
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,840
This is not battle, Wiglaf.

594
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,680
This is slaughter.

595
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,840
The Frisians want to make
themselves heroes, my Lord.

596
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,040
They want the bards
to sing of their deeds.

597
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,080
It's going to be a short song.

598
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,520
Now, can you blame them?

599
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,320
Your legend is known
from the high seas

600
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,520
and the snow barriers
to the great island kingdom.

601
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,440
You are the monster slayer.

602
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,840
We men are the monsters now.

603
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,560
The time of heroes is dead, Wiglaf.

604
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,800
The Christ God has killed it,

605
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:29,720
leaving humankind with nothing
but weeping martyrs,

606
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,480
fear and shame.

607
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,320
Show me to Beowulf!
Show me to King Beowulf!

608
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,200
Come on, Frisian. Speak up!

609
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,640
Leave him!

610
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,560
You think it sport
to mock your opponents in this fashion?

611
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,920
Let him die quickly,
with some honor still intact.

612
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,640
Coward!

613
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,240
Kill me yourself!

614
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,800
Balls! The king
must never engage in direct battle.

615
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,840
Kill the invader now! Do it quickly!
Put his head on a spear.

616
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,120
Stop!

617
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,240
My Lord, the king
must not engage in direct battle.

618
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,480
Let him up.

619
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,960
You want your name
in the Song of Beowulf?

620
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:31,480
You think it should end with me killed
by some Frisian raider with no name?

621
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,120
I'm Finn of Frisia

622
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,200
and my name
shall be remembered forever.

623
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,200
Only if you kill me!

624
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,040
Otherwise, you're nothing.

625
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,240
You think you're the first to try to kill me,
or the hundredth?

626
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,840
Well, let me tell you something, Frisian.

627
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,200
The gods will not allow my death
by your feeble blade.

628
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:05,600
The gods will not allow me to die
by a sword, or be taken by the sea.

629
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,840
The gods will not let me
pass in my sleep, ripe with age!

630
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,720
Plant your ax here, Finn of Frisia.
Take my life.

631
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,800
Someone give him a sword, or I'll...

632
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,520
You'll what? Kill me?

633
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:28,720
Well, kill me! Do it! Kill me! Kill me!

634
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,200
You know why you can't kill me,
my friend?

635
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,440
'Cause I died many, many years ago
when I was young.

636
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,880
Give him a gold piece
and send him home.

637
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,880
He has a story to tell.

638
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,320
Your Majesty?

639
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,600
Are you hurt?

640
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,600
Not a scratch.

641
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,600
So beautiful.

642
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,680
And so young.

643
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,120
You know, Ursula, when I was young,

644
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:59,080
I used to think being a king
was about battling every morning

645
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,640
and counting the gold
and loot in the afternoon

646
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,800
and swiving beautiful women
every evening.

647
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:11,040
But now, well, nothing is as good
as it should have been.

648
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,520
Not even the "swiving a beautiful woman
every night" part, Your Majesty?

649
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,880
Well, some nights, Ursula, some nights.

650
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,760
Perhaps tonight?

651
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,680
No, tonight, I feel my age upon me.

652
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,000
Tomorrow, after the celebrations.

653
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,440
We can't forget what tomorrow is,
can we now?

654
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,280
Your day.
When the Song of Beowulf is told

655
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,240
of how you lifted the darkness
from the land.

656
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,720
And the day after,
we celebrate the birth of Hallend Christ.

657
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,200
I see you've survived.

658
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,680
Alas, my Queen,

659
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,200
the Frisian invaders
have been pushed into the sea.

660
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,480
You are not a widow,

661
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,520
yet.

662
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,920
How comforting, my husband.

663
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,480
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

664
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,160
Unferth.

665
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,800
You're not celebrating
your King's glory tonight?

666
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,000
I have something for the King.

667
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,200
What is it?

668
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,080
I said I have something for the King.

669
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,480
- Show it to me.
- I will not.

670
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,680
You will show it to me first.

671
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,720
Bollocks, Wiglaf.

672
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,400
I'll show it first to Beowulf.
The King needs to see it.

673
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,840
The King

674
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,600
needs to see what?

675
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,840
Lost and now found.

676
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,040
A gift fit for a king.

677
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,600
Do you recognize it?

678
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,640
Where did you find this?

679
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,720
On the moors. My slave Cain found it
on the barren hill where nothing grows.

680
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,280
I beat him for treading near
such an unholy place.

681
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,080
My Lord,

682
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,240
isn't this...

683
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,600
So, Lord Beowulf,

684
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,960
it's come back to you,
after all these years.

685
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,480
My Lord, this is the slave who found it.

686
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,800
Please, please don't kill me!

687
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,760
Where did you find this treasure?

688
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,640
I'm sorry I ran away, Master.
But please don't hurt me no more.

689
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,560
- Answer your King!
- Stop!

690
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,840
Stop.

691
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,720
Where?

692
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,280
Up, up on the moors.

693
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,880
But I was gonna bring it back, Master.
I swear.

694
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,560
Is that all?

695
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,680
No demon? No witch?

696
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,600
No woman?

697
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,480
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

698
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:04,120
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

699
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:09,600
<i>Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!</i>

700
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:18,440
Look at you. You're nothing,

701
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,120
an empty nothing.

702
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,920
Come forth!

703
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,960
Show yourself!

704
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,240
Even with all your riches,

705
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:34,720
your kingdom, your power, your glory

706
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,000
and your women.

707
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:44,800
Which one do you think
I should kill first,

708
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,000
your pretty little bedwarmer,

709
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,800
or your wise Queen?

710
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,840
What are you?

711
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,240
I'm something you left behind,

712
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,760
Father!

713
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,920
Another restless night?

714
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,520
It's all right, girl.

715
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,280
I'm not going to eat you.

716
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,560
He has bad dreams.

717
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,800
They've been coming more often.

718
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,240
He's a king, and kings
have a lot on their conscience.

719
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,520
He calls your name in his sleep.

720
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,880
Does he?

721
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:21,200
I believe he still holds you in his heart.

722
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,240
Do you?

723
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,640
I often wonder

724
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,360
what happened.

725
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,800
To us?

726
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,200
Too many secrets.

727
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,440
God, help us.

728
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,600
What? What do you want of me?

729
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,160
I have a message for my father.

730
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,400
Tell me! What did this?

731
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,720
I saw our whole village burn.
Children screaming as they died!

732
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,720
I saw it, Your Majesty,
vomiting fire and smoke!

733
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,600
Damn you! What was it?

734
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,160
A dragon!

735
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,520
- It's Unferth, my Lord!
- Unferth.

736
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,960
You say a dragon did this? Stop!

737
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,320
You had an agreement.

738
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,120
You would not be harmed.

739
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,000
But now the golden horn
has returned to you.

740
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,480
The agreement is ended.

741
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,600
Who? Who said that?

742
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,880
"The sins of the fathers!"

743
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,720
That's the last thing I heard.

744
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:12,160
The last thing before
my family was burned alive!

745
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,840
The sins of the fathers!

746
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:19,040
Sins of the fathers!

747
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,120
The sins of the fathers!

748
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,040
The sins of the fathers!

749
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,240
Take up your positions along
the northern edge of the great gorge.

750
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,040
It is our only hope if I fail.

751
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,400
My Lord.

752
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,960
Don't go, I beg you!

753
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,360
You are free. I release you.

754
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,440
Find a good man and bear him children.
But bear him a son.

755
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,360
I don't want anyone else. I want you.

756
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,920
I am not the man you think me to be!

757
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:01,160
You're a great man! And a hero!
This I know to be true.

758
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,040
Then you are as foolish
as the rest of them!

759
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,480
Very impressive, dear.

760
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:22,920
But the armor suited you better
when you were younger.

761
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,880
I'm sure it did.

762
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,080
Why don't you take that poor girl

763
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,360
and live out your remaining years
in peace?

764
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,040
Let some young hero save us.

765
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,480
What?

766
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,520
And let the nightmare
start all over again?

767
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,760
No. I visited this horror
upon my kingdom.

768
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,880
- I must be the one to finish her.
- Her.

769
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,240
Was she so beautiful, Beowulf?

770
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,960
A beauty so costly?

771
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,840
Beautiful, and full of fine promises.

772
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,160
I was weak.

773
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,480
I am sorry.

774
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,560
So, so sorry.

775
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:37,040
I have always loved you, my Queen.

776
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,080
And I you.

777
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,160
Keep a memory of me,

778
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,720
not as a king or a hero,

779
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,800
but as a man,

780
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,960
fallible and flawed.

781
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,360
This is the place.

782
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,840
Where you slayed Grendel's mother.

783
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:30,360
Wiglaf, I have no sons,

784
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:35,560
and if this demon kills me,
I have arranged with the heralds

785
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,920
that you shall be king.

786
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,480
Don't speak of such things, my Lord.

787
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:46,120
Great friend,
there is something you should know.

788
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,880
Nay! There is nothing I should know.

789
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,040
You are Beowulf.
Beowulf the mighty, the hero!

790
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,560
The slayer and destroyer of demons!

791
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:57,040
Now, let us kill this flying devil
where it sleeps

792
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,360
and get on with our bloody lives!

793
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,000
- Do you want me to go in with you?
- No.

794
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,080
Good.

795
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,040
Beowulf.

796
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,560
It has been a long time.

797
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,880
Take your damned horn
and leave my land in peace.

798
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,440
Too late, my love.

799
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,800
Odin's swifan balls!

800
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,160
It's heading for Herot!

801
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,600
Now!

802
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,480
Hrothgar.

803
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:12,240
Come on, come on!
Come on! Come on!

804
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:24,720
Damn you!

805
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,200
I'll have your lizard head on a spike!

806
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,080
No!

807
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,160
My Lord!

808
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:04,280
No!

809
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:34,240
Over here! Attend the Queen.

810
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,440
- Attend the Queen.
- Attend the Queen.

811
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:17,800
I told you we were too old to be heroes.

812
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,440
Let's get you to a healer.

813
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,480
Not this time, old friend.

814
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:26,240
You are Beowulf.

815
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,720
A little thing like this
isn't going to finish you off.

816
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,960
Do you hear her?

817
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,480
I hear nothing.

818
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,400
Grendel's mother,
my son's mother, my...

819
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:43,120
- No, my Lord.
- My...

820
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,480
You killed Grendel's mother
when we were young.

821
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,360
They sing of it.

822
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,400
Too late for lies, Wiglaf.

823
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,040
Too late.

824
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,920
He was

825
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:06,360
the bravest of us.

826
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,320
He was the prince

827
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,760
of all warriors.

828
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,920
His name will live forever.

829
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:35,320
His song shall be sung forever.

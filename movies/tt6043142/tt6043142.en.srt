Oh, that's original, I've

<i>My mommy won't
allow a dog at our house.</i>

60
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:11,850
Why won't she allow a dog
in your house?

61
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:13,619
She says that three
daughters is hard enough.

62
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:16,722
Iggy! What did I say
about disappearing like that?

63
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:20,727
- What're you doing?
- <i>I'm cuddling Boss.</i>

64
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:22,261
You sure as hell
better not be Boss.

65
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:25,332
No, no, he's...
No, he's the handsome one.

66
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,700
You can't just go around
harassing strangers like that.

67
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:29,001
- <i>Nah, she wasn't.</i>
- I'm not.

68
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:30,903
Yeah, you were,
you're annoying.

69
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:32,938
- Nobody wants to play with you.
- <i>Come on, baby, let's go.</i>

70
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,373
<i>Come on.</i>

71
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,842
- He seems to really like her.
- Yeah, well.

72
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,111
- Thanks for lettin' her pat him.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

73
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:40,713
Come on, let's go baby.

74
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,948
<i>There's a
threat to our people.</i>

75
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,785
<i>And I'm here to say it's not
because we hate anyone else</i>

76
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,886
<i>I don't hate the Jenks,
the niggers</i>

77
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:50,023
<i>the Muslims or the dykes.</i>

78
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,725
I don't hate them.
They have a right to live.

79
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:57,030
But we say,
"Not on our American soil!"

80
00:06:57,032 --> 00:06:58,664
Not in our fuckin' life!

81
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,767
<i>So maybe we should just...</i>

82
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:02,801
make them leave!

83
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:04,671
- Fuckin' leave!
- Get them the fuck out!

84
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,640
- Make them fuckin' leave!
- Get them the fuck out!

85
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:08,107
<i>That is why,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

86
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:10,143
I have decided
to officially run

87
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:12,811
for the Ohio House
of Representatives.

88
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,150

91
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,991
You forget the last time
you ran for congress,

92
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:28,361
you left the entire fuckin'
movement bankrupt?

93
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,765
- God bless America!

I thought I told you about that.

120
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:09,995
You can't come in here

122

00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:54,574
Uh, he's just a little bitch,
you know?

134
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:57,476
He thinks he's the shot caller,
but...

135
00:09:57,478 --> 00:09:59,244
You, uh, comin' back

No, we're done with this shit.

138
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,550
It's our last gig.

139
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:05,250
Why?

140
00:10:05,252 --> 00:10:07,452
- Why?
- Yeah.

141
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:09,855
I don't want my kids
to be around this.

142
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:11,794
We're just here for a paycheck.

143
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:16,061
- Got a long drive ahead, huh?
- Yeah.

144
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:19,132
- Michigan? How long is that?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:21,301
It's only a couple of
hours once we're out of here.

146
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:23,136
You got kids?

147
00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:25,404
Uh, no, just this guy.

148
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:27,105
<i>Can I have a picture with Boss?</i>

149
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:28,307
- You want a picture?
- <i>I don't know baby.</i>

150
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,246
You gotta ask his daddy.

151
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,447
<i>Come here, come here, sit!</i>

152
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,082

156
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,123

157
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,926
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

158
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:50,997
You, uh, you make it back
to Toledo much, or?

159
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:51,767
No.

160
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:55,534
<i>Can we go home?</i>

161
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:57,839
If you, uh, if you do
make it back, uh...

162
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,978
I got my own shop.

163
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:05,481
<i>Can we go?</i>

164
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:35,340
- Stop. Stop.
- Come on.

165
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:38,176
I'm too fucked up.
I don't wanna do this shit.

166
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:47,052
- No, no, no, I don't...
- Bryon.

167
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,553
- I can make you feel better.
- I don't...

168
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:51,590
Why don't you let me
make you feel better?

169
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:54,393
- Bryon. Stop! Fuck you, Bryon!
- Get out! Get out!

170
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:57,196
Fuckin' tired of this shit.
I want you out.

171
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:59,231
- No!
- Go! Now!

172
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:27,088
<i>Police! Open up!</i>

173
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:36,999
Don't fuckin' move!
Don't move!

174
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:40,700
<i>Stay down.
Stay! Stay!</i>

175
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:43,201
- What's goin' on?
- <i>Let's go. On your feet!</i>

176
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:44,570
Let's go.

177
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:03,292
<i>Face the glass.</i>

178
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,062
<i>Turn and face the door.</i>

179
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:10,165
<i>Turn around.</i>

180
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:19,104
<i>At least 19 injured
people are still in the hospital.</i>

181
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:21,340
<i>Including this kid.</i>

182
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:24,744
You morons really banged it out,
didn't you?

183
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:26,412
<i>Disorderly conduct,</i>

184
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:28,480
<i>misdemeanor,
assault and battery.</i>

185
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,349
<i>Carrying concealed weapons.</i>

186
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:35,790
Agent Marks. Bryon Widner.

187
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:40,792
K is the 11th letter
in the alphabet.

188
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:42,795
Three eleven's
equals thirty-three

189
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:44,797
which equals KKK.

190
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,335
Six stands for six generations
of Vinlanders

191
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:52,705
<i>W for white,
A, alliance.</i>

192
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:56,808
<i>When the moment comes, you're
gonna be begging me for a deal.</i>

193
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,744
But it's gonna be
too fuckin' late.

194
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:03,282
Because I got so precious
little patience.

195
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:05,884
With meathead racist

196
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:09,388
motherfuckers like you.

197
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,657
This is what I'm offering,
it is a one time deal.

198
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:17,463
I need a full decode of these
telltale tats of yours.

199
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,731
Names, numbers...

200
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,468
Everything you did.
And didn't do.

201
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,238
And we will have you
moved somewhere.

202
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,906
Far enough.

203
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:28,844
You'll be looked after.

204
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:35,850
Okay.

205
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:39,388
Alright.

206
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:42,524
Yeah, let me show you.

207
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,427
Just try and get these off.

208
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:51,730
Here, I can show you.

209
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:55,600
Just...

210
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:57,570
<i>I can fucking show you.</i>

211
00:15:57,572 --> 00:16:00,540
<i>Oh, let me get these fuckin'
pants down. There you go.</i>

212
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,441
<i>Alright.</i>

213
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:05,344
<i>See that?</i>

214
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:06,711
<i>You guys wanna shoot that?</i>

215
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:09,949
<i>Get a picture of that?</i>

216
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:12,518
Do you wanna get a fuckin'
picture of that?

217
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,387
- Got it?
- Yeah, got it.

218
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:18,427
Get him out of here.

219
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,331
He's a fuckin' corpse.

220
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,632
Love you, guys. Fuck you!

221
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:29,402
<i>More tattoos on his
face, the more scared he is.</i>

222
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:32,207
<i>Alright, there.
Let's caption that.</i>

223
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:36,609
<i>Bryon "Babs" Widner.</i>

224
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:38,911
Viking Social Club.

225
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:41,247
What exactly
is your strategy here?

226
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:42,848
We doxin' him.

227
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,551
We're gonna film these fascists,
we're gonna put it online...

228
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:48,387
<i>and we out these motherfuckers
to the world.</i>

229
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:50,388
<i>Make 'em lose
their goddamn jobs.</i>

230
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,992
Confront 'em
everywhere they go.

231
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:54,994
What's gonna stop
pieces of shit like him

232
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:57,463
from creatin' more damage?

233
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:00,365
Guys like this
only have three options.

234
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:02,835
Die young, life in prison...

235
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:06,504
or, they start talkin'.

236
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:08,307
- <i>Let's hope he starts talkin'.</i>
- Fuck that.

237
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:11,444
There ain't no hope
for motherfuckers like him.

238
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:14,312
They fucked Lonnie up.

239
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:16,418
I suggest we do the same.

240
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,423
Come here, man.
Let me talk to you for a second.

241
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:24,825
<i>Come on.</i>

242
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:40,740
<i>See that wall?</i>

243
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:44,644
<i>That's 15 years of work.</i>

244
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,379
<i>A lot of these guys out
are here were just like Babs.</i>

245
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:49,317
<i>But one by one,
they turned.</i>

246
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,853
See I started this because
I was angry, just like you.

247
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:57,555
Matter of fact, shit,
I'm still angry.

248
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:58,823
<i>But all the shit
that they do to us</i>

249
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:01,359
and nobody seems
to give a damn.

250
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:04,330
It's that anger that becomes a
part of the emotional tool box

251
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:07,366
that we use to do this work.

252
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:09,734
<i>I would also argue that we
can't stay angry forever</i>

253
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:12,538
because that brings more blood
and more anger

254
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,573
and more blood
and just never stops.

255
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:16,844
<i>Am I right?</i>

256
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,515
My father...

257
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,619
He was a... a drug counselor
all his life.

258
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:28,888
He used to have this saying...

259
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,826
"I take human garbage and
I turn it into human beings."

260
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:39,598
Look, if we can turn
one of these fascist assholes...

261
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,702
so they can see the error
of their ways

262
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,637
then I'll leave a crack
in the door.

263
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:50,778
<i>Goin' home?</i>

264
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:59,885
One day,
when you deep sleepin'

265
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:02,855
we gon' find you
and fuck you up.

266
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:06,091
You're a monster,
you ain't gonna see shit comin'.

267
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:07,592
We gon' crack
your head open.

268
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:09,628
Slice open
your motherfuckin' face.

269
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,697
Just like you did to my son,
you piece of shit.

270
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:14,934
- Hey! Ma'am! Ma'am!
- He's 14! 14!

271
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,636
<i>Why didn't you let him go?
Why didn't you let him...</i>

272
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,972
Ma'am, calm down, ma'am!

273
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:26,678
- Answer me! Why?
- Calm down!

274
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,714
Arrest him! Not me!

275
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,549
Don't! Get off me!

276
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:33,953
I'm comin' for you!
I am comin' for you!

277
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:36,388
In your dreams,
motherfucker!

278
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,090
In your dreams!

279
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:40,993
You will never forget
about me!

280
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:43,428
You better not
close your eyes.

281
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,130
<i>Get off me!</i>

282
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,144
She tried to take
your eyes out and...

283
00:19:58,146 --> 00:20:01,513
You didn't even move,
you should've just kept walkin'.

284
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:03,616
<i>Somethin' wrong?</i>

285
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:05,184
Just tired I guess.

Hey, you in the patches,
come on over here for a second.

295
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,131
Your mom can do better
than that.

296
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:56,167
Gavin's gonna get molested.
Don't get molested, Gavin!

297
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:57,471
Watch out.

298
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,743
Oh, can't we just get
out of here? I need to shower.

299
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:05,211
If your a fuckin' pervert,
I'll smash your face.

300
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:07,745
Yeah, that's the spirit,

301
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:10,049
I say death to all pervs.

302
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,016
<i>What's your name, kid?</i>

303
00:21:12,018 --> 00:21:14,052
- Gavin.
- <i>Gavin, come on over here.</i>

304
00:21:14,054 --> 00:21:16,054
- <i>You live around here?</i>
- <i>Jesus.</i>

305
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:18,491
- You want a beer?
- Oh, fuckin' hell.

306
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:19,594
<i>Sure.</i>

307
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:27,800
Gavin, I'm the Hammer,
this is my son, Babs.

308
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:29,905
<i>You ever hear
of the Vinlanders Social Club?</i>

309
00:21:33,073 --> 00:21:34,974
<i>You watch YouTube,
I got a YouTube channel</i>

310
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:36,809
called Race and Reason.

311
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:38,878
Might find it interesting.

312
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,679
<i>Where you from, Gavin?</i>

313
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:43,048
Pennsylvania.

314
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,951
Social Club's gonna have
a dinner tonight.

315
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:48,920
Lot of good eats,
why don't you come on over, huh?

316
00:21:48,922 --> 00:21:51,724
<i>Where you thinkin'
of crashin' tonight?</i>

317
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:53,995
- Just here, with my gang.
- Your gang?

318
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:58,731
Hey, listen, Gavin,
you wanna join the real deal

319
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,899
<i>and do some real damage?</i>

320
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,068
Not hang out here
and smash bottles

321
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,005
with a bunch
of pussy faggots.

322
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:10,678
Come on.

323
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:45,644
- Hey, monkey.
- Hey, Ma.

324
00:22:45,646 --> 00:22:48,250
- How you holdin' up? Yeah?
- I'm good.

325
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:54,587
I knew they didn't have
shit on you.

326
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:55,920
I have a clean towel
and some warm lunch for you

327
00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:57,191
waitin' inside.

328
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:02,764
What's going on?

329
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:06,735
Ma, meet Gavin.

330
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:09,635
Find him a room.

331
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:11,869
She's gonna take
good care of you.

332
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:13,140
Hi, precious.

333
00:23:18,678 --> 00:23:19,680
Come here.

334
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:28,119
Why don't I give you
some lunch first, okay?

335
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:29,888
Yeah? Yeah.

336
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,957
Fatten that baby boy up!

337
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:36,895
Go inside, hon'.

338
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:56,442
Come on!

339
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:12,159
Hey!
Leave my fuckin' dog alone!

340
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:34,312
- He's my fucking dog!
- He's a fucking Vinlander.

341
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,782
You wanna fucking go again?

342
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:39,885
Our ancestors
were spilling blood

343
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:42,120
for the call of the Odin Gods.

344
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:45,924
And you cocksuckers are acting
like a bunch of Mexican faggots

345
00:25:45,926 --> 00:25:48,494
fighting over a burrito.

346
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:50,431
Who's the retard behind this?

347
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:54,803
I asked, who's responsible?

348
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:59,707
- I am.
- Why'd you do it?

349
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:05,980
What're you, fuckin' deaf?
Give me a straight answer.

350
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:08,750
April...

351
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:13,551
Babs hurt April.
I hurt him back.

352
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:17,222
Well, that makes a lot more
sense to me then, huh?

353
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:21,426
Gavin, Slayer has dishonored
himself. Again.

354
00:26:21,428 --> 00:26:25,296
And his Vinlander brothers,
because Slayer

355
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:29,267
is a worthless,
fathead fuck sack of shit

356
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:31,536
who I've been trying
to turn into a man

357
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:33,539
since he was
a stupid teenager.

358
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:36,875
But obviously, I failed.

359
00:26:36,877 --> 00:26:39,244
And for that reason...

360
00:26:39,246 --> 00:26:42,414
Every time Slayer fucks up,
I am taxing you

361
00:26:42,416 --> 00:26:46,185
you, you and you
a hundred bucks.

362
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,985
Simple as that.

363
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:50,923
Because in this family,
we don't tolerate stupidity.

364
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,424
Got that?

365
00:26:52,426 --> 00:26:53,891
- Yes, sir.
- I can't hear you!

366
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:56,093
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

367
00:26:56,095 --> 00:26:57,531
Now, apologize.

368
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:02,437
I'm sorry.

369
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,476
Like a real Viking.

370
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:18,386
Accept my offering, oh,
brother.

371
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:30,365
Hail.

372
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:33,034
Hail.

373
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,306
Kid's your probate,
show him around, guide him.

374
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:44,478
<i>For the rest of you,
dismissed, for now.</i>

375
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:54,022
Good boy, good boy,
good boy.

376
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:58,293
Hey.

377
00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:02,494
How you guys, uh,
how you guys doin'?

378
00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:05,030
Well, you know,
we're livin'.

379
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:07,131
<i>Oh, yeah, well,
it was a very cool photo.</i>

380
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:08,433
<i>Thank you
for sending it to me.</i>

381
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:10,601
Hey! Hey! Desi!

382
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:14,074
Desi! You let her be.
I'm on the fucking phone.

383
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:18,209
- Is this a bad time? Should I...
- Look, I, uh...

384
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:19,677
I gotta go cook the girls
some dinner

385
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,379
before they start stabbin'
each other and me.

386
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:23,014
- So...
- <i>You want me to stop by?</i>

387
00:28:23,016 --> 00:28:24,448
<i>I can stop by if you want.</i>

388
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,921
<i>I can bring, uh,
you sound like you need a beer.</i>

389
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:31,290
We can just, uh...

390
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,224
<i>Look, I...</i>

391
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:35,293
<i>I know it's gonna sound
like an excuse, but...</i>

392
00:28:35,295 --> 00:28:37,495
I don't really feel like being
nice to anyone right now.

393
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:39,231
<i>I just fuckin'
hate being nice to anybody.</i>

394
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:41,667
<i>So, let's just sit outside,</i>

395
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:44,403
<i>we can fucking bitch
about life...</i>

396
00:28:44,405 --> 00:28:46,304
<i>Just a couple minutes.</i>

397
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:48,607
What, you're gonna drive all
that way for a couple minutes?

398
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:50,242
<i>Yeah, I was supposed to
be in the neighborhood anyway.</i>

399
00:28:50,244 --> 00:28:53,211
- <i>Oh yeah?</i>
- I got a body to bury, so...

400
00:28:58,718 --> 00:29:00,519
So I'll see you later?

401
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:03,155
Alright, then.

402
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:06,992
- Uh, gotta go. Gotta go. Bye.
- <i>Okay.</i>

403
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:10,227
- How's Boss, brother?
- What's your name?

404
00:29:10,229 --> 00:29:12,097
Gavin.

405
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:14,332
Gavin, you're the lowest form
of life in this club.

406
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:16,167
My dog holds a higher position
than you do.

407
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:19,071
I'm your senior VP. You don't
fucking call me brother.

408
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:20,638
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

409
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,576
Good,
then get the fuck out of here.

410
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:25,280
Yes, sir.

411
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:31,116
- Why'd you get in the truck?
- Sorry?

412
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:33,053
You heard me, why the fuck
did you get in the truck?

413
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:37,723
To keep America white.
Keep this country pure.

414
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:40,993
- Earn my patches and...
- It's alright, cut that shit.

415
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:44,196
Cut that shit,
what're you doin' here?

416
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:45,629
- Becomin' a Vinlander.
- So you what?

417
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:47,131
Shaved your head
and you got the fuckin' shirt

418
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,600
feel like a man now?

419
00:29:49,602 --> 00:29:52,637
Do you?
You feel like a big man?

420
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:54,505
You gotta stand
like a fuckin' Viking.

421
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:56,611
Stand like a fuckin' Viking,
be like a man!

422
00:29:58,746 --> 00:30:01,049
- Yes, sir.
- What're you doin' here?

423
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:07,351
- I was hungry.
- You hungry?

424
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:10,254
Go back to Pennsylvania,
you fuckin' idiot.

425
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:12,124
<i>You wanna go for a walk?
Come on, let's go.</i>

426
00:30:56,303 --> 00:30:58,169
Hey, Julie.

427
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:01,108
- Hey.
- <i>How you doin'?</i>

428
00:31:04,277 --> 00:31:06,711
Good.

429
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:09,680
- What's goin' on?
- Behind on the rent again.

430
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:13,452
Uh, yeah, no. I-I know,
I'll, I'll get it to you, I promise.

431
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,655
Look, I got a complaint
from one of the neighbors.

432
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:19,457
<i>You and your girls
were at a hate rally.</i>

433
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:21,792
<i>No, no. No, no, no.
It was, it was just a gig, okay?</i>

434
00:31:21,794 --> 00:31:24,329
<i>We're, we're a little short
on cash right now, so...</i>

435
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:27,267
<i>I thought we had an
agreement about those gigs.</i>

436
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:32,736
I don't want
any Nazis in my house.

437
00:31:32,738 --> 00:31:34,674
Or in my neighborhood.

438
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:39,246
You know, people change,
Sheryl.

439
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:59,231
- Bad timing?
- Perfect timing for a beer.

440
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:00,501
- Yeah?
- Hm.

441
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:09,310
Oh.

442
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:13,448
It's, uh...

443
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:17,314
It's Boss.

444
00:32:18,752 --> 00:32:21,253
There's the... She could
have it with, you know...

445
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:23,522
When she misses him.

446
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,459
<i>I found it in a gas station.</i>

447
00:32:28,394 --> 00:32:29,663
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

448
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:36,303
What you lookin' at?

449
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,639
You.

450
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,176
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

451
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:45,446
Oh, fuck.

452
00:32:48,814 --> 00:32:51,249
Our five minutes are up.

453
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:53,187
Got more than five minutes.

454
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,659
Okay. Good job. Okay.

455
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:05,132
Got it on? Breathe. Okay.

456
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:07,734
Okay. Slow.

457
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,874
<i>Thanks.</i>

458
00:33:24,817 --> 00:33:26,753
Do you have one
that you regret?

459
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,788
Some.

460
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,822
- What? You got one you regret?
- I...

461
00:33:31,824 --> 00:33:33,891
Hm, maybe.

462
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:34,926
Let's see it, let's see it,
let's see it.

463
00:33:34,928 --> 00:33:36,962
No.

464
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:38,796
I wanna fuckin' see it.
Let's see it.

465
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:41,268
Fuck. Okay.

466
00:33:43,303 --> 00:33:45,803
<i>Danny Lombardo gave it to me.</i>

467
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:47,671
Can't even look at it
without being sick.

468
00:33:47,673 --> 00:33:49,573
I can fix that for you.

469
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:51,509
That's fuckin' easy,
that's like...

470
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:53,714
For me,
fuckin' bread and butter.

471
00:33:55,314 --> 00:33:58,251
So... when was your first one?

472
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:01,188
This right here.

473
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:04,522
This, I got it
when I was 14.

474
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:08,359
And, um... Uh,
Fred gave it to me, actually.

475
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:09,961
- <i>Fred?</i>
- Yeah, he, uh-uh...

476
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,899
President of the club,
and, um...

477
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:15,633
So, I was, uh...

478
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:18,503
I lived with my mom, grow,
growin' up, and, uh,

479
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:20,805
she had a, a drinking problem,
she passed away,

480
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:22,941
and, uh,
I moved in with my dad.

481
00:34:22,943 --> 00:34:25,809
Um,
he was a fuckin' drinker too.

482
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:28,646
Fuckin' horrible fuckin' drunk.
Horrible. The worst.

483
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:32,283
And, um, I w-went from,
you know,

484
00:34:32,285 --> 00:34:34,318
cleanin' up bottles
to havin' 'em thrown at my head.

485
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,387
Running away constantly, uh,

486
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,325
lived on the streets
for a while.

487
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,894
And, um, Fred took me in.

488
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:46,430
Picked me up,
put clothes on me,

489
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:49,434
fed me... got me a job.

490
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:51,369
Um, I owe him.

491
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:53,338
- Fuckin' made me, that guy.
- I don't know...

492
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,606
And Shareen too, both.

493
00:34:55,608 --> 00:34:56,576
Okay.

494
00:34:57,711 --> 00:35:00,812
- What?
- I just...

495
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:03,284
I think real family
don't make you owe shit.

496
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:08,419
The only responsibility
I have...

497
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:10,387
are those three girls.

498
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:12,659
I just want 'em to have
a better life than I did.

499
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,062
Well, you're a good mom.

500
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:19,631
I don't know about that.

501
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:20,899
The fuck are you talkin' about?
You...

502
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:22,837
You're all they have.

503
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:26,604
- Hm.
- Fuck them.

504
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:28,606
Fuck those people
who wanna tell you

505
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:30,742
what to do and how to raise
your own fucking kids.

506
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:33,077
Fuck them. Fuck 'em!

507
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:35,113
- Fuck 'em.
- Yeah. Fuck 'em.

508
00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:37,816
Fuck 'em. Yeah.
Fuck them.

509
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:39,486
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.

510
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:52,497
- What are these scars?
- Nothin'.

511
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:54,064
What do you mean?

512
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:57,635
- They're fuckin' nothing. Hey.
- What are they?

513
00:35:57,637 --> 00:35:58,870
Oh, what?
Are we not being honest now?

514
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:01,039
No, you keep asking, and...

515
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:02,707
You'll fuckin' find out
what they are

516
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,376
if you keep asking
stupid fuckin' questions

517
00:36:04,378 --> 00:36:05,646
that's for sure.

518
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:09,414
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

519
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:11,950
- What are you gonna do to me?
- I gonna fuckin' cut you.

520
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:15,053
- With my fuckin' razor.
- Hm...

521
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:17,088
I'm gonna make you bleed.

522
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,090
And then I'm gonna
fuckin' lick it off you.

523
00:36:19,092 --> 00:36:21,959
That's what I'm gonna do. I'm
gonna fuckin' lick it off you.

524
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:23,995
- Is that a promise?
- Yeah, it is.

525
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:24,965
Yeah?

526
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:09,909
Ooh.

527
00:37:35,135 --> 00:37:36,968
Desi, I wouldn't be here

528
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,503
if I didn't see potential
in this, okay?

529
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:41,004
- Oh, yeah.
- Try it today.

530
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:42,907
Just, just give me something,
yeah?

531
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:44,608
- I'm trying.
- You're not trying.

532
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,144
He's actually trying.
Okay, guys!

533
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:47,845
Come on! Calm down.

534
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:49,680
She's throwing popcorn at me,
I can't help it!

535
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:55,889
Just try.

536
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:03,595
- <i>Hot dog.</i>
- There she goes again.

537
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:07,200
And on three, two, one...

538
00:38:09,503 --> 00:38:11,439
Fuck you too, mom.

539
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:16,941
There you go.
That's how you do it.

540
00:38:16,943 --> 00:38:19,711
- I got something for you guys.
- Ooh! Oh.

541
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:23,280
- This is for Iggy Pop.
- Yay! Thank you.

542
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:25,517
- Sierra.
- Thank you.

543
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,086
- And Desi.
- Thanks.

544
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,120
Open it, open it, open it,
open it, open it, open it.

545
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:31,722
Oh, it's so cute!

546
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:35,959
What you doin', huh?
What you doin'?

547
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:37,898
I don't think she likes it.

548
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:46,704
You guys wanna go surfing?

549
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:48,539
Wow!

550
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:51,142
I'm gonna show you.

551
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:53,678
- Drive okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

552
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,648
Good.

553
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:58,149
This is it.

554
00:38:59,218 --> 00:39:00,919
- Awesome.
- It's cool.

555
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:04,055
Wow. This is incredible.

556
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:05,526
<i>So what?</i>

557
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:09,760
Are all these yours?

558
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:11,963
<i>Yeah, the ones top left. Yes.</i>

559
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:14,966
- <i>You are talented.</i>
- <i>I wouldn't go that far.</i>

560
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:16,733
- How much do these go for?
- Uh, those ones there...

561
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:18,903
Three-fifty-four, and...
Starting from there.

562
00:39:18,905 --> 00:39:20,872
- Wait, seriously?
- Uh-huh.

563
00:39:20,874 --> 00:39:22,740
Wow, you must make good money.

564
00:39:22,742 --> 00:39:24,175
<i>Well, it all goes to the club,
but on a good day,</i>

565
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:26,646
bring in about 1200, 1500,
somethin' like that.

566
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:30,782
- Hey, can I get this one?
- <i>No.</i>

567
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:33,084
No, no, we spoke about this.
Not till you're 18.

568
00:39:33,086 --> 00:39:35,022
Yeah, I got somethin'
for you guys, hang on.

569
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:38,356
<i>You guys like transfers?</i>

570
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:40,892
They're like fake tattoos,
basically.

571
00:39:40,894 --> 00:39:42,626
Here, Sierra.
You try this before?

572
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:44,829
- Oh, they're pretty.
- Just put 'em on your arm...

573
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:48,131
- Don't fuckin' touch me.
- Hey, Des.

574
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,200
- Where you goin'?
- Air.

575
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:53,704
Don't go far, okay?
We're leaving in an hour.

576
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:55,340
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's alright, it's alright.

577
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:20,164
- Can you draw?
- No.

578
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,265
<i>Oh,
I hope you like the rainbow behind it.</i>

579
00:40:25,238 --> 00:40:26,903
<i>I felt so bad when she...</i>

580
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:28,305
I'm sorry, listen...

581
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:30,675
- No, I thought it would be cool.
- No, ignore it.

582
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:32,843
She's not a kid anymore.

583
00:40:32,845 --> 00:40:35,146
She had it rough
when she was a kid.

584
00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:36,617
Did something happen to her?

585
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:41,119
<i>Wait, was it that fuckin'
douchebag, what's his name?</i>

586
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:42,887
- Danny Lombardo.
- <i>That's the one.</i>

587
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:45,055
Yeah, a piece of shit
to give me that?

588
00:40:45,057 --> 00:40:47,658
What'd he do?

589
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,294
I came home early
from work one day,

590
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:52,162
found him in her room
beating the shit out of her.

591
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,338
Told myself no one will ever
lay another hand on my kids.

592
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,342
No one.

593
00:41:06,345 --> 00:41:11,082
- Hey, doll, is that car yours?
- My mom's.

594
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:12,950
<i>You're Babs'
friend, aren't ya?</i>

595
00:41:12,952 --> 00:41:16,754
- My mom is.
- And she dragged you down here?

596
00:41:16,756 --> 00:41:19,026
This is the last place you
wanna be stuck in, huh, doll?

597
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,160
- <i>Yeah, kinda.</i>
- Yeah.

598
00:41:23,162 --> 00:41:25,028
<i>Are they inside?</i>

599
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,302
Yeah, he's givin' her
a tattoo or somethin' retarded.

600
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:32,035
You're Desiree from Sid's?

601
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:34,805
<i>Yeah, you've got the voice
of an angel, babe.</i>

602
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:38,108
I'm Shareen.
You can call me Ma.

603
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,079
Nice to meet you.

604
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,017
Hey, do you have a lighter?

605
00:41:56,195 --> 00:41:58,729
Hm. Sorry, rude of me.

606
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:01,332
- You first.
- Thanks. I'm not allowed.

607
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:02,834
What do you mean,
you're not allowed?

608
00:42:02,836 --> 00:42:04,836
- Who's not allowing you?
- My mom.

609
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:07,171
<i>Your mom's not allowing you?</i>

610
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:10,041
I'll tell you what,
I'm the owner of this place.

611
00:42:10,043 --> 00:42:11,742
And I'm allowing you
to do whatever you want,

612
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:14,077
so, how about that?

613
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,012
<i>You got very delicate skin.</i>

614
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:18,451
- Oh, yeah? You like it?
- I love it.

615
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:23,421
Yeah.

616
00:42:35,535 --> 00:42:38,903
What's the verdict?

617
00:42:38,905 --> 00:42:40,841
- It's pretty strong.
- <i>Mm.</i>

618
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:58,923
You like her?

619
00:42:58,925 --> 00:43:01,792
- Yeah, she's cool.
- That's Freya.

620
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:04,394
Goddess of love and death.

621
00:43:04,396 --> 00:43:06,497
You know,
she slayed the souls of sinners

622
00:43:06,499 --> 00:43:09,267
killed in battle,
so they could feast in Valhalla?

623
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:12,206
That's how cool she is.
Mm-hm.

624
00:43:15,508 --> 00:43:17,874
<i>She's all yours, precious.</i>

625
00:43:17,876 --> 00:43:20,178
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

626
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,148
You got her killer eyes
and her gorgeous hair.

627
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,119
Thanks.

628
00:43:32,224 --> 00:43:34,158
Shit. I gotta go.

629
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,892
Hey.

630
00:43:35,894 --> 00:43:37,831
First one's on us, doll.

631
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:00,584
- How're they doin' back there?
- I don't know.

632
00:44:00,586 --> 00:44:02,456
- Are they alright?
- Yeah, I think they are.

633
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,164
- Come on, go fast!
- Go faster!

634
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,099
Hey!

635
00:44:22,608 --> 00:44:25,142
Whoo!

636
00:44:25,144 --> 00:44:27,211
- Ready?
- Hands off the wheel!

637
00:44:27,213 --> 00:44:31,615
Not even driving!
Not even driving!

638
00:44:57,043 --> 00:44:58,608
Finally.

639
00:45:06,385 --> 00:45:08,322
Think it came out pretty good.

640
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:13,957
<i>Oh, my God. This is incredible.</i>

641
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,459
- <i>You know what it is?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

642
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:19,032
It's a black bat flower.

643
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,635
It's beautiful.

644
00:45:24,637 --> 00:45:27,137
This is a fuckin' great job,
yeah.

645
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:30,106
Hey. Hey...

646
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:31,377
You like it?

647
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:34,615
I like
when you're a part of us.

648
00:45:44,122 --> 00:45:46,090
- I wanna be inside you?
- Yeah?

649
00:45:46,092 --> 00:45:48,258
Yeah. I wanna be inside you.

650
00:46:30,535 --> 00:46:34,738
<i>Come on. Let's go here.</i>

651
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,075
<i>Ah. This is it.</i>

652
00:46:39,077 --> 00:46:40,644
Iggy, what do you think
about my look?

653
00:46:40,646 --> 00:46:42,713
You like it? Maybe should've
put some blood on it.

654
00:46:42,715 --> 00:46:46,017
But you're a skeleton,
skeletons don't have blood.

655
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:48,184
<i>Yeah. You girls excited, huh?</i>

656
00:46:48,186 --> 00:46:50,254
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

657
00:46:50,256 --> 00:46:51,622
<i>Looks good.</i>

658
00:46:51,624 --> 00:46:54,492
Just your friendly
neighborhood documentarian.

659
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:56,227
It's the Antifa welcoming party.

660
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:57,461
- <i>Shut the fuck up, Jenkins.</i>
- <i>Alright.</i>

661
00:46:57,463 --> 00:46:59,399
Y'all have a nice day now.

662
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,166
- Put this on.
- Okay.

663
00:47:02,168 --> 00:47:04,104
Got it? Hold my hand.

664
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:09,205
Happy Halloween!

665
00:47:09,207 --> 00:47:11,408
- How y'all doin'?
- Hey, don't film the kid.

666
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,778
Hey. Oh, shit,
is that you, Babs?

667
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,379
Goddamn, what the hell?

668
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:18,182
Oh, shit.
Hey, who's this pretty lady?

669
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:19,749
- Hey, what's your name, huh?
- Just keep walking.

670
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:21,419
Listen, how you been?
I want to talk to you, man.

671
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,820
Oh! You know
white boys can't jump.

672
00:47:22,822 --> 00:47:24,155
Stop that shit.

673
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:25,488
Come on, Babs.

674
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,624
So, you're a family man now?

675
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,291
Listen, talk to me, Babs, yeah.

676
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:29,559
You need my help? Huh?

677
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:30,561
You need my help?
Come on, man.

678
00:47:30,563 --> 00:47:32,662
Hey, hey! Come on, man!

679
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:34,365
Come on, Babs,

680
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:36,100

681
00:47:36,102 --> 00:47:37,568
You know what
kinda people they are.

682
00:47:39,405 --> 00:47:41,508
<i>You got a heart,
you ain't like them, Babs.</i>

683
00:47:45,278 --> 00:47:47,211
<i>I still love you, Babs!</i>

684
00:47:47,213 --> 00:47:49,747
Anytime you need me, baby,
I'm right here. You hear me?

685
00:47:49,749 --> 00:47:51,685
<i>Just up here, keep goin'.</i>

686
00:47:56,689 --> 00:47:58,254
<i>Here it is.</i>

687
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:02,225
- <i>Hey, monkey.</i>
- <i>Hey, Ma.</i>

688
00:48:02,227 --> 00:48:04,428
<i>Look at you!
You're looking fabulous.</i>

689
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,396
- You like it?
- I love it.

690
00:48:06,398 --> 00:48:08,399
- <i>Oh, I love it.</i>
- <i>How you been?</i>

691
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:11,102
- Good.
- I want you to meet some people.

692
00:48:11,104 --> 00:48:12,769
- This is Iggy.
- <i>Hi.</i>

693
00:48:12,771 --> 00:48:15,271
- Desi, Sierra.
- Hi.

694
00:48:15,273 --> 00:48:16,539
<i>Yeah, hey, Des.</i>

695
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,374
This is their mom, Julie.

696
00:48:18,376 --> 00:48:20,343
Hey. Heard a lot about you.

697
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:22,680
I bet you have.

698
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:24,715
Hey, girls, why don't you
join the rest of the kids?

699
00:48:24,717 --> 00:48:26,483
Go grab a torch,
burn the Jihadi.

700
00:48:26,485 --> 00:48:29,820
Uh, no. We're not
into that anymore, sorry.

701
00:48:29,822 --> 00:48:32,655
You're not into Halloween?

702
00:48:32,657 --> 00:48:35,492
- <i>We're into candy.</i>
- <i>Okay, you into hot dogs?</i>

703
00:48:35,494 --> 00:48:38,229
Roger's roasted some wieners,

704
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:39,597
<i>Here, take this
Go pass that around.</i>

705
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,700
- <i>Come this way.</i>
- Take him, honey.

706
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:46,769
Get me a beer.

Uh, we've been together

711
00:48:59,418 --> 00:49:01,551
Enjoy it while it lasts.

712
00:49:01,553 --> 00:49:05,856
'Cause I know my son and he
ain't there for the long run.

<i>We'll be there in a minute.</i>

739
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:09,481
Look...

740
00:51:13,452 --> 00:51:14,888
I like you.

741
00:51:16,555 --> 00:51:18,321
I like...

742
00:51:18,323 --> 00:51:20,823
I like how you treat my girls,
but...

743
00:51:20,825 --> 00:51:22,762
I'm not doing this again.

744
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:25,662
We've gone too far,
I'm not...

745
00:51:25,664 --> 00:51:28,631
I'm not putting them
back in this shit.

746
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:30,903
I'm not doing it.
I won't have 'em around it.

747

You're better
than those racist shitheads.

748

This is my family.

749
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,910
And I know that they're, um...

750
00:51:39,912 --> 00:51:41,381
It's not normal.

751
00:51:44,015 --> 00:51:45,952
But this is what I have.

752
00:51:50,088 --> 00:51:53,323
But I want you...

753
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:54,957
And I would never let
anything happen

754
00:51:54,959 --> 00:51:56,896
to those girls, ever.

755
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:01,534
Swear to me.

756
00:52:10,476 --> 00:52:11,244
Fuck.

757
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,613
I'm gonna get
round your mouth, right?

758
00:52:17,615 --> 00:52:20,550
- Uh, right there?
- Uh-huh.

759
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:22,586
- Is it cold?
- Mm-hm.

760
00:52:22,588 --> 00:52:23,954
Uh, so, what was your favorite
candy that you ate?

761
00:52:23,956 --> 00:52:25,057
Um...

762
00:52:26,025 --> 00:52:27,459
Lollipop.

763
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,363
It's not comin' off!

764
00:52:33,365 --> 00:52:35,365
You gotta do it harder.

765
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:37,033
Get in there.

766
00:52:37,035 --> 00:52:39,405
Is it true, what Desi said?

767
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:42,840
I don't know.
What did Desi say?

768
00:52:42,842 --> 00:52:44,910
That you're an evil man.

769
00:52:50,816 --> 00:52:52,952
I don't know.

770
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,676
Maybe you're an evil man.

771
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:20,647
Maybe you're an evil man.

772
00:53:45,137 --> 00:53:46,769
Yeah. Yep.

773
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:48,571
<i>Did I wake you up, princess?</i>

774
00:53:48,573 --> 00:53:49,972
No, no. What's going on?

775
00:53:49,974 --> 00:53:51,844
<i>Get your ass outta bed.</i>

776
00:53:53,711 --> 00:53:55,648
<i>Get a move. Now.</i>

777
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:03,954
I'll be right there, okay?

778
00:54:03,956 --> 00:54:05,892
Give me two secs.

779
00:54:07,992 --> 00:54:09,528
<i>See ya.</i>

780
00:54:21,907 --> 00:54:24,173
Hey, baby. What are you doing,
what are you doing up?

781
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:26,578
- What's going on?
- Go back to sleep.

782
00:54:27,213 --> 00:54:28,644
What's going on?

783
00:54:28,646 --> 00:54:30,012
Fred, he called
a last minute meeting.

784
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:31,747
So, I'm gonna...

785
00:54:31,749 --> 00:54:34,751
- It's like three a.m.
- I know.

786
00:54:34,753 --> 00:54:35,919
It's not gonna last very long,

787
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:37,120
so why don't you
go back to bed?

788
00:54:37,122 --> 00:54:38,588
I was trying not to wake you up.

789
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:39,957
No-no-no, what, where...

790
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:41,158
No, it's just gonna be
a quick little meeting.

791
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,758
I'll be back before you wake up.

792
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,029
Are they here?

793
00:54:45,564 --> 00:54:46,963
You fucking kidding me?

794
00:54:46,965 --> 00:54:48,097
Give me a break,
just go back to...

795
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:49,666
- Hey!
- What?

796
00:54:49,668 --> 00:54:51,033
Call them,
tell them you're not going.

797
00:54:51,035 --> 00:54:53,102
- I can't.
- Are you serious right now?

798
00:54:53,104 --> 00:54:54,805
You fucking liar.

799
00:54:54,807 --> 00:54:57,608
Girls! We're going.

800
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:00,010
- Get up, Iggy. Now.
- <i>Julie, what are you doing?</i>

801
00:55:00,012 --> 00:55:03,012
We're leaving. Get up, get up.

802
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:05,983
Stop, will you talk to me
for a second, please?

803
00:55:05,985 --> 00:55:07,718
- Iggy, now!
- What's going on?

804
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,519
- Get your stuff.
- What happened? What happened?

805
00:55:09,521 --> 00:55:11,053
- What did he do to you?
- It doesn't matter.

806
00:55:11,055 --> 00:55:13,023
- What did he do to you?
- Just get your stuff. Take this.

807
00:55:13,025 --> 00:55:14,957
<i>Take this.
I'm done talking to you.</i>

808
00:55:14,959 --> 00:55:16,193
I have to, I have to...

809
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:18,695
I'm an idiot, what am I doing?

810
00:55:18,697 --> 00:55:21,265
What was I thinking?
I should've done it!

811
00:55:21,267 --> 00:55:24,700
- Come here. Come here.
- Here, take this.

812
00:55:24,702 --> 00:55:26,068
Mom, tell me what's going on?

813
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:27,803
Just take this, take this...

814
00:55:27,805 --> 00:55:29,740
- Mom, what's happening?
- Mom!

815
00:55:29,742 --> 00:55:31,807
Get off of her! Get off of her.

816
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:33,809
- Iggy, go. Go.
- Why are you doing this?

817
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:35,646
- Go. Iggy, Iggy, go.
- Julie.

818
00:55:35,648 --> 00:55:36,914
- Iggy. No!
- Julie!

819
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,582
- I wanna stay with Boss!
- Get off of me.

820
00:55:38,584 --> 00:55:40,584
Iggy, I know, baby.

821
00:55:40,586 --> 00:55:43,253
You have to go. Go.
Take her downstairs now.

822
00:55:43,255 --> 00:55:45,923
- Julie... please.
- No. No-no-no. No-no-no.

823
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,658
I came here for you, for this!

824
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,227
It's not gonna change
our fucking lives!

825
00:55:57,936 --> 00:55:59,738
Julie! Fuck.

826
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:01,905
Julie.

827
00:56:01,907 --> 00:56:05,111
Stop. Stop, stop. Fuck. Stop!

828
00:56:06,278 --> 00:56:08,615
Hey. Hey!

829
00:56:09,914 --> 00:56:11,914
Come back, Julie!

830
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:13,950
You have to trust somebody
at some point, you know that.

831
00:56:13,952 --> 00:56:16,221
Yeah, it sure as hell
ain't starting with you.

832
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:41,044
<i>The fuck was that back there?</i>

833
00:56:41,046 --> 00:56:43,213
We got in a fight. It's none
of your fuckin' business.

834
00:56:43,215 --> 00:56:46,115
You ain't got time
for that shit.

835
00:56:46,117 --> 00:56:48,151
Hey, did she tell you
her old man

836
00:56:48,153 --> 00:56:51,622
back in Wisconsin was
with the Klan in the old days?

837
00:56:51,624 --> 00:56:53,026
She tell you that?

838
00:56:56,361 --> 00:56:57,894
She didn't mention
that to me, no.

839
00:56:57,896 --> 00:56:59,296
Yeah, he was a goddamned rat.

840
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:00,934
Dropped the patch.

841
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:04,834
What's the kid doin' here?

842
00:57:04,836 --> 00:57:06,370
He's earnin' his reds tonight.

843
00:57:06,372 --> 00:57:09,071
- Aren't you, son?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

844
00:57:09,073 --> 00:57:11,878
<i>Hey, Gavin,
why don't you give Babs a beer?</i>

845
00:57:17,249 --> 00:57:19,084
Loosen the fuck up.

846
00:57:42,374 --> 00:57:44,811
<i>Alright, let's go. Go.</i>

847
00:58:23,048 --> 00:58:26,718
<i>Fuck outta here!
Let's go! Move, let's go!</i>

848
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,486
<i>Come on, come on, move it, man!</i>

849
00:58:34,425 --> 00:58:36,361
Go, go, go, go on.

850
00:58:53,378 --> 00:58:54,347
Shit!

851
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:00,850
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Gimme that!

852
01:00:43,521 --> 01:00:45,555
One People's.

853
01:00:45,557 --> 01:00:47,423
<i>You have a collect call from...</i>

854
01:00:47,425 --> 01:00:49,024
<i>Bryon Widner.</i>

855
01:00:49,026 --> 01:00:51,861
<i>To accept this call, press one.</i>

856
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
Hello?

857
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:06,075
<i>Hey, how you doin'?
Can you hear me?</i>

858
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:08,514
- <i>It's me.</i>
- <i>I'm listening.</i>

859
01:01:10,014 --> 01:01:13,285
Listen, I, uh, I quit.

860
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,086
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

861
01:01:17,088 --> 01:01:18,320
<i>You really
think I'd be calling you</i>

862
01:01:18,322 --> 01:01:20,258
<i>if I was still in this shit?</i>

863
01:01:23,095 --> 01:01:26,629
That kid from the
rally, is he okay?

864
01:01:26,631 --> 01:01:29,298
Why do you wanna know?

865
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,269
<i>Because I feel
fuckin' sick about what I did.</i>

866
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,539
Yeah, you should.

867
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,608
That's a start.

868
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:42,412
Let's just say he's got some,
uh, good people around him.

869
01:01:42,414 --> 01:01:44,613
I tried burnin'
my fuckin' face off.

870
01:01:44,615 --> 01:01:47,182
That didn't work.

871
01:01:47,184 --> 01:01:49,121
I don't know what to do.

872
01:01:50,956 --> 01:01:53,892
Look, you know I can help you
but it ain't for free.

873
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,559
I need information.

874
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:59,497
<i>About your Viking family.</i>

875
01:02:11,575 --> 01:02:14,209
Hey, girls, don't forget
to pack the closet, okay?

876
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:15,480
- Okay.
- Yeah.

877
01:02:27,693 --> 01:02:30,426
Boss!

878
01:02:30,428 --> 01:02:32,898
<i>Mom,
can we get this thing out of here?</i>

879
01:02:48,146 --> 01:02:49,582
You look like shit.

880
01:02:52,517 --> 01:02:54,520
I just came to say
that I'm sorry.

881
01:02:57,255 --> 01:03:00,189
- And?
- And we took off.

882
01:03:00,191 --> 01:03:03,126
We left. It was just him
and these bags.

883
01:03:03,128 --> 01:03:05,530
That's it. That's all I got.

884
01:03:08,432 --> 01:03:10,633
Yeah, well,
I don't trust you.

885
01:03:10,635 --> 01:03:14,738
I get it, but I'm gonna do
whatever it takes...

886
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,307
to prove it to you
I'm not gonna fuck it up again.

887
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:18,611
I'm not.

888
01:03:23,148 --> 01:03:24,381
- No.
- Julie. Hey, wait!

889
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,783
Julie! Julie, wait! Julie!

890
01:03:26,785 --> 01:03:30,285
We burned down a mosque
in Toledo.

891
01:03:30,287 --> 01:03:33,390
And there was people inside.
And it felt fuckin' sick.

892
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,658
It felt fuckin' wrong.

893
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,193
I just want it all
to be fuckin' over.

894
01:03:37,195 --> 01:03:40,195
I am never fucking
goin' back there, ever.

895
01:03:40,197 --> 01:03:41,566
I am out.

896
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:48,974
What are Ma and Pa
gonna think about that?

897

01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,608
- Nothing?
- No.

941
01:08:19,411 --> 01:08:21,077
Like nothing.... There's
nothing at all in the system?

942
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:23,014
There's nothing I can do?

943
01:08:49,073 --> 01:08:50,041
Hey.

944
01:08:52,677 --> 01:08:53,646
Thanks.

945
01:09:07,991 --> 01:09:10,827
I just wanna say, uh, thanks
so much for helpin' us out.

946
01:09:10,829 --> 01:09:12,761
- I appreciate it.
- It's workin' out, right?

947
01:09:12,763 --> 01:09:14,931
- All good. Yeah.
- Good.

948
01:09:59,943 --> 01:10:01,577
- What's going on?
- I tried calling you.

949
01:10:01,579 --> 01:10:03,482
- You didn't answer.
- Oh, I didn't hear it.

950
01:10:30,808 --> 01:10:33,077
- Hail, mother earth.
- Hi, Ma.

951
01:10:36,747 --> 01:10:38,683
You look like shit, sweetie.

952
01:10:40,585 --> 01:10:42,150
<i>Hey.</i>

953
01:10:46,691 --> 01:10:49,525
Come on, relax.

954
01:10:49,527 --> 01:10:52,093
Nick, get him a beer.
Sit down.

955
01:10:52,095 --> 01:10:54,031
<i>Freddy, did you see this?</i>

956
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:57,999
<i>Oh, my...</i>

957
01:10:58,001 --> 01:10:59,635
I fuckin' knew
there was a wedding.

958
01:10:59,637 --> 01:11:02,538
<i>I knew it. I told you.</i>

959
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,509
<i>Right?</i>

960
01:11:09,647 --> 01:11:12,114
It smells so shitty in here.

961
01:11:12,116 --> 01:11:16,586
Hi, baby. Stop it! You!

962
01:11:16,588 --> 01:11:19,689
Stop being so cute. Cutie.

963
01:11:19,691 --> 01:11:21,257

969
01:11:43,982 --> 01:11:45,815
It's just a temp job,
you know?

970
01:11:45,817 --> 01:11:48,717
But y-you got a job.
You tat people, we pay for it.

971
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,686
Well, now, the plan is to open
my own tattoo shop soon, so...

972
01:11:51,688 --> 01:11:54,190
- Really? That's the plan?
- Working for that, yeah.

Honey, you ain't built
to run your own business.

I wasn't talking to you, was I?
I was talking to my son.

You're not even
his real fuckin' mother.

978
01:12:02,866 --> 01:12:05,200
- Julie.
- Do I even fucking know you?

979
01:12:05,202 --> 01:12:08,270
Oh, yeah, hey. Nice to meet you.
I'm Julie, Bryon's wife.

980
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:10,006
- <i>Remember?</i>
- Yeah?

981
01:12:10,008 --> 01:12:12,240
What kind of wife
sends her husband

to pick up shit with illegals
in the middle of...

983
01:12:13,878 --> 01:12:15,211
The same fucking wife

984
01:12:15,213 --> 01:12:16,279
who has to make a living.

985
01:12:16,281 --> 01:12:17,312
You're gonna let her trash-talk

986
01:12:17,314 --> 01:12:19,250
your mother like that?

987
01:12:22,253 --> 01:12:24,654
Pa, you think you can
give us a minute?

988
01:12:24,656 --> 01:12:25,624
Please.

989
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:35,163
What the fuck?
Why the fuck are they here?

990
01:12:35,165 --> 01:12:36,832
- I don't know.
- What the hell?

991
01:12:36,834 --> 01:12:38,167
- I'm calling the cops.
- Don't call the cops.

992
01:12:38,169 --> 01:12:42,038
- Why not?
- Just let me talk to 'em.

993
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,142
Let me find out what they want.
Just take the kids to school.

994
01:12:54,152 --> 01:12:56,785
- I'm not leaving you alone.
- I dunno what's gonna happen.

995
01:12:56,787 --> 01:12:58,119
I don't know
what they're gonna do.

996
01:12:58,121 --> 01:12:59,654
You need to get the kids
and get outta here.

997
01:12:59,656 --> 01:13:01,259
- It's not safe for them here.
- Fuck.

998
01:13:03,594 --> 01:13:04,595
Let's go.

999
01:13:08,799 --> 01:13:11,766
- I'll be fine.
- You fuckin' better be.

1000
01:13:11,768 --> 01:13:13,769
You come back to me, okay?

1001
01:13:13,771 --> 01:13:15,706
I promise I'll be alright.

1002
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,217
- Hurry.
- <i>Bye, bye, Iggy.</i>

1003
01:13:33,357 --> 01:13:35,293
I'll see you guys after,
okay?

1004
01:13:48,973 --> 01:13:50,338
Nick.

1005
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,873
Hey.

1006
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:54,010
- Come on, you know the drill.
- Yup.

1007
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,281
Just for security reasons,
you know?

1008
01:13:58,116 --> 01:14:00,382
- So what, are you dodging us?
- Nope.

1009
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:03,653
<i>You left the shop.
You don't answer your phone.</i>

1010
01:14:03,655 --> 01:14:05,287
<i>You don't show up
at meetings anymore.</i>

1011
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:08,190
You haven't paid your dues. I
don't even know if you remember.

1012
01:14:08,192 --> 01:14:09,859
- What do you call that?
- I was just here.

1013
01:14:09,861 --> 01:14:11,827
I was working my ass off.

1014
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:13,695
Working your ass off.

1015
01:14:13,697 --> 01:14:17,065
We think it's time for you
to come back home, kiddo.

1016
01:14:17,067 --> 01:14:19,003
You drive down here
to tell me that?

1017
01:14:21,805 --> 01:14:23,338
No.

1018
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,708
You see, the cops back home,
they found

1019
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:30,011
four illegals hiding
in the field behind that mosque.

1020
01:14:30,013 --> 01:14:32,847
Now, it turns out, they were
working construction that day,

1021
01:14:32,849 --> 01:14:34,883
sleeping inside
a storage room

1022
01:14:34,885 --> 01:14:37,185
<i>inside the mosque
when we burned it down.</i>

1023
01:14:37,187 --> 01:14:41,023
<i>But somehow they got away.
Fuckin' miracle, right?</i>

1024
01:14:41,025 --> 01:14:43,191
All the boys, they say
you were the last to leave.

1025
01:14:43,193 --> 01:14:45,093
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

1026
01:14:45,095 --> 01:14:46,995
All I wanna know, Babs,
is...

1027
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:49,398
What the hell is going on?

1028
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,466
What do you mean?

1029
01:14:50,468 --> 01:14:51,700
Because we got the Feds

1030
01:14:51,702 --> 01:14:52,735
showin' up at the shop

1031
01:14:52,737 --> 01:14:54,470
and six Jihadis runnin'

1032
01:14:54,472 --> 01:14:58,110
around town jeopardizing
an entire movement.

1033
01:15:04,482 --> 01:15:07,349
I didn't see
any fucking illegals.

1034
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:09,318
- If I saw any fuckin' illegals...
- You're lying.

1035
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,220
- <i>I didn't see any illegals.</i>
- You're a fucking liar!

1036
01:15:11,222 --> 01:15:13,388
No, no, no, because I had to
burn the motherfuckers alive.

1037
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:15,157
- He's lying.
- Are you... Are you crazy?

1038
01:15:15,159 --> 01:15:16,992
- And this fucking wedding.
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

1039
01:15:16,994 --> 01:15:18,894
This whole shit!
It's a fucking cover!

1040
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:21,062
She's my wife! A cover?
Are you fucking insane?

1041
01:15:21,064 --> 01:15:22,364
You've been listening
to this little bitch?

1042
01:15:22,366 --> 01:15:23,833
<i>He can't even fuckin' read.</i>

1043
01:15:23,835 --> 01:15:25,101
You don't like
the fuckin' match

1044
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:26,435
because your hands
were shaking...

1045
01:15:26,437 --> 01:15:28,837
Alright, no, no, no!
Ey, settle down!

1046
01:15:28,839 --> 01:15:31,275
- Fucking stop!
- Sit down!

1047
01:15:41,451 --> 01:15:43,387
I want a word with my son.

1048
01:15:51,394 --> 01:15:53,330
Get the fuck out.

1049
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,873
You can't keep runnin' away
from us like that.

1050
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:06,175
You can't.
You can't do that.

1051
01:16:06,177 --> 01:16:09,078
Pa needs you. I need you.

1052
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,546
- I'm not going back.
- No, you have no choice.

1053
01:16:10,548 --> 01:16:12,080
- I'm not going back.
- Otherwise...

1054
01:16:12,082 --> 01:16:13,114
They're gonna think
you're hiding...

1055
01:16:13,116 --> 01:16:14,483
I fucking live here!

1056
01:16:14,485 --> 01:16:16,284
This is my fucking family!

1057
01:16:16,286 --> 01:16:19,821
I'm done with this crap! I'm
not gonna be like that anymore.

1058
01:16:30,567 --> 01:16:33,269
- Son?
- Hm.

1059
01:16:33,271 --> 01:16:38,210
I promise you... I will not
let them touch my baby boy.

1060
01:16:40,044 --> 01:16:42,981
Okay? I promise you that.

1061
01:16:45,049 --> 01:16:47,986
But I am so scared
for these girls.

1062
01:18:05,095 --> 01:18:06,395
Look familiar?

1063
01:18:07,531 --> 01:18:09,064
Shut the fuck up!

1064
01:18:09,066 --> 01:18:10,532
I never fuckin' seen this...

1065
01:18:10,534 --> 01:18:12,901
<i>They eyeballed your ass, Babs.</i>

1066
01:18:12,903 --> 01:18:14,435
- They can't testify.
- I've never seen this...

1067
01:18:14,437 --> 01:18:16,271
I've never seen these people
before in my life.

1068
01:18:16,273 --> 01:18:17,672
- Take it, Babs.
- I swear to God.

1069
01:18:17,674 --> 01:18:19,074
- I've never seen these...
- Take this screwdriver.

1070
01:18:19,076 --> 01:18:20,275
And finish 'em off.

1071
01:18:21,545 --> 01:18:24,012
- Come on.
- Are you fuckin' dumb?

1072
01:18:24,014 --> 01:18:28,050
Hm? Take a closer look
'cause they definitely saw you.

1073
01:18:28,052 --> 01:18:30,118
They're fucking kids.
That's a kid.

1074
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,087
<i>What are you talking about?
They're Hajis.</i>

1075
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:35,994
Clean up your fucking mess.

1076
01:18:37,193 --> 01:18:39,694
I'm not doin' it.
I'm not...

1077
01:18:39,696 --> 01:18:42,263
Go ahead.

1078
01:18:42,265 --> 01:18:43,599
I'm not fuckin' doin' it!
You're gonna have to kill me!

1079
01:18:43,601 --> 01:18:46,034
Go ahead! Do it!

1080
01:18:49,706 --> 01:18:53,141
Go ahead, just fuckin' do it.

1081
01:18:53,143 --> 01:18:54,575
Just fuckin' do it
'cause I'm not doin' that.

1082
01:18:54,577 --> 01:18:55,677
Go ahead.

1083
01:18:57,113 --> 01:18:59,448
You fuckin' pig.

1084
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:00,418
Whatever!

1085
01:19:05,156 --> 01:19:08,157
Fucking Christ!
What the fuck are you doing?

1086
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:12,493
Oh! Oh, fuck!

1087
01:19:12,495 --> 01:19:16,131
<i>Fuck me.
That little bitch isn't dead.</i>

1088
01:19:16,133 --> 01:19:18,434
Get up and finish
your fucking mess.

1089
01:19:18,436 --> 01:19:20,601
Oh,
you fuckin' piece of shit.

1090
01:19:20,603 --> 01:19:24,074
<i>Get the fuck up
and finish the fucking job!</i>

1091
01:19:25,409 --> 01:19:27,512
Get up, you little faggot!

1092
01:19:32,415 --> 01:19:34,650
Fuck you!
You fucking piece of shit!

1093
01:19:34,652 --> 01:19:37,418
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fucking number two!

1094
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:40,455
Fuck you! You fucking
little shit! Fuck...

1095
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:44,258
Babs! Babs!

1096
01:19:47,164 --> 01:19:49,097
What the fuck, Slayer?

1097
01:19:49,099 --> 01:19:52,101
<i>Alright,
I think we get the point.</i>

1098
01:19:52,103 --> 01:19:54,470
Alan, Nick, take Babs in.

1099
01:19:54,472 --> 01:19:57,439
<i>Finish off the Hajis
and burn 'em.</i>

1100
01:19:57,441 --> 01:19:59,708
<i>Let's wrap this fucking
party up and go home.</i>

1101
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:02,744
Nobody fucking move.
Get back in the truck.

1102
01:20:02,746 --> 01:20:04,613
What?

1103
01:20:04,615 --> 01:20:06,550
You made the fucking rules,
boss.

1104
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:10,752
Babs dropped
the fucking patch.

1105
01:20:10,754 --> 01:20:13,055
Bryon has to go.

1106
01:20:13,057 --> 01:20:14,992
He'll go when I decide.

1107
01:20:21,765 --> 01:20:24,099
I'm not your fuckin' monkey.

1108
01:20:24,101 --> 01:20:26,135
<i>And I'm tired of you
calling me stupid names.</i>

1109
01:20:26,137 --> 01:20:28,404
And backing up
with this fucking traitor!

1110
01:20:28,406 --> 01:20:31,205
Slayer, I hear you.
I know you're angry.

1111
01:20:31,207 --> 01:20:34,309
Let's, let's just go home
and solve this.

1112
01:20:34,311 --> 01:20:35,580
<i>Okay, pumpkin?</i>

1113
01:20:37,747 --> 01:20:39,683
Please, put the gun down.

1114
01:20:41,384 --> 01:20:43,151
<i>I hear you.
I know you're angry.</i>

1115
01:20:43,153 --> 01:20:44,653
You know what?

1116
01:20:44,655 --> 01:20:48,791
It's time for the old fuck
and her majesty to step down

1117
01:20:48,793 --> 01:20:50,793
and let the young folk
take the lead.

1118
01:20:50,795 --> 01:20:52,627
You boys?

1119
01:20:52,629 --> 01:20:55,763
Because we cannot stand
your fucking attitude anymo...

1120
01:21:10,246 --> 01:21:14,052
Congratulations, son, you just
earned yourself a second patch.

1121
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:18,656
Kid's got more balls than
the rest of you fucking faggots.

1122
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,696
<i>Alright, clean it up.</i>

1123
01:22:20,918 --> 01:22:24,685
Oh, God! Bryon? Baby?

1124
01:22:24,687 --> 01:22:26,521
<i>Listen, I can't really talk.</i>

1125
01:22:26,523 --> 01:22:28,190
<i>He's at Toledo Hope.</i>

1126
01:22:28,192 --> 01:22:30,462
<i>Get here fast
before they kill him.</i>

1127
01:22:31,762 --> 01:22:33,865
<i>Get here. Get here now.</i>

1128
01:22:39,702 --> 01:22:43,905
<i>I've only been to a
hospital two times in my life,</i>

1129
01:22:43,907 --> 01:22:49,578
the day I was born and the day
Ma went into labor.

1130
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:51,515
When finally I got here...

1131
01:22:52,782 --> 01:22:54,718
I just knew it was over.

1132
01:22:56,452 --> 01:22:57,722
No heartbeat.

1133
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:00,457
No nothin'.

1134
01:23:01,925 --> 01:23:03,393
And Ma...

1135
01:23:05,562 --> 01:23:08,363
She had to go through labor

1136
01:23:08,365 --> 01:23:11,733
and deliver a still baby

1137
01:23:11,735 --> 01:23:14,671
with the cord
wound around his neck.

1138
01:23:20,945 --> 01:23:23,747
Took us a whole year
to get back to ourselves.

1139
01:23:25,381 --> 01:23:28,816
We didn't dare
get attached to

1140
01:23:28,818 --> 01:23:30,921
anything that was ours again.

1141
01:23:34,857 --> 01:23:37,758
<i>Babs, you're more
than a son to us.</i>

1142
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,566
Ma and I, we made
a real investment in you.

1143
01:23:42,765 --> 01:23:44,701
But in this business...

1144
01:23:46,437 --> 01:23:47,569
you've gotta stay focused

1145
01:23:47,571 --> 01:23:51,840
or... fall...

1146
01:23:51,842 --> 01:23:53,777
right down the rabbit hole.

1147
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:08,356
You're still breathing
because I own you.

1148
01:24:08,358 --> 01:24:10,628
And every inch of ink on you.

1149
01:24:16,366 --> 01:24:20,968
The only way anyone else
gets access to your trophies

1150
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:23,907
is if I ask them out myself.

1151
01:24:35,619 --> 01:24:37,519
<i>So who is it?</i>

1152
01:24:37,521 --> 01:24:40,457
Feds? Jenkins?

1153
01:24:41,325 --> 01:24:43,260
SPLC?

1154
01:24:46,597 --> 01:24:48,532
<i>What'd you give 'em, son?</i>

1155
01:24:49,566 --> 01:24:53,368
Hm? Hm?

1156
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:55,870
What do they know about us?
Huh?

1157
01:24:55,872 --> 01:24:57,808
<i>What do they know?</i>

1158
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,548
Bryon Widner.

1159
01:25:42,085 --> 01:25:43,720
Oh, baby.

1160
01:25:48,025 --> 01:25:49,958
Hey.

1161
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,959
Hey.

1162
01:25:51,961 --> 01:25:54,495
- Hey.
- Mm-hm.

1163
01:25:54,497 --> 01:25:57,768
I'm here. I'm here.

1164
01:26:05,142 --> 01:26:07,077
Here. Here.

1165
01:26:08,612 --> 01:26:09,580
Here.

1166
01:26:31,101 --> 01:26:33,571
- Are you sure?
- Mm.

1167
01:27:05,835 --> 01:27:09,003
- Babs?
- Just Bryon, yeah.

1168
01:27:09,005 --> 01:27:10,605
I don't really go
by Babs anymore.

1169
01:27:10,607 --> 01:27:13,574
Oh, good.
Never liked that name no way.

1170
01:27:18,549 --> 01:27:19,517
Look.

1171
01:27:20,983 --> 01:27:22,452
I wanna help.

1172
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,887
But the Feds need
your full cooperation

1173
01:27:26,889 --> 01:27:28,824
on this thing, Bryon.

1174
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:33,528
Okay?
There ain't no deal without it.

1175
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:35,096
I just wanna know where we're
gonna go,

1176
01:27:35,098 --> 01:27:36,998
where we're gonna live. Where
the... What about the girls?

1177
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,632
Look, man, look, all of that

1178
01:27:38,634 --> 01:27:40,101
is classified, okay?

1179
01:27:40,103 --> 01:27:42,570
Even I won't know
unless you want me to.

1180
01:27:42,572 --> 01:27:45,774
Well, what about school
for the girls?

1181
01:27:45,776 --> 01:27:47,775
- They will be taken care of.
- <i>I see.</i>

1182
01:27:47,777 --> 01:27:49,877
I promise you that.

1183
01:27:49,879 --> 01:27:52,012
It's been a hard time.

1184
01:27:52,014 --> 01:27:54,583
I mean, yeah,
especially for...

1185
01:27:54,585 --> 01:27:56,918
- The little one.
- Yeah.

1186
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:59,119
<i>Well, look, man.</i>

1187
01:27:59,121 --> 01:28:01,590
<i>Look, you have an out,
Bryon.</i>

1188
01:28:01,592 --> 01:28:03,057
<i>I can help you.</i>

1189
01:28:03,059 --> 01:28:05,927
Your birth certificate
and your arrest sheet

1190
01:28:05,929 --> 01:28:09,263
will be the only signs
that you are still alive.

1191
01:28:09,265 --> 01:28:11,266
<i>Alright?</i>

1192
01:28:11,268 --> 01:28:13,834
<i>Other than that,
you'd just be</i>

1193
01:28:13,836 --> 01:28:17,705
<i>some... average nobodies
in this country.</i>

1194
01:28:17,707 --> 01:28:20,644
I'm not exactly fucking average,
I mean, look at me.

1195
01:28:25,147 --> 01:28:27,083
You've got a point there.

1196
01:28:30,821 --> 01:28:31,789
Okay.

1197
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:33,991
Here's the thing.

1198
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:37,859
I wasn't gonna say anything

1199
01:28:37,861 --> 01:28:40,628
because I didn't wanna get
your hopes up.

1200
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:41,598
<i>Alright?</i>

1201
01:28:44,067 --> 01:28:48,869
There's this wealthy old lady
that works with the SPLC.

1202
01:28:48,871 --> 01:28:53,641
Now... she's been working there
for years.

1203
01:28:53,643 --> 01:28:56,977
They asked her
if she'd put up the money

1204
01:28:56,979 --> 01:29:01,149
to remove the tattoos
from your face.

1205
01:29:01,151 --> 01:29:05,886
<i>She heard about your story.
She was moved.</i>

1206
01:29:05,888 --> 01:29:08,722
<i>We'll have another meeting.
They're gonna talk to her.</i>

1207
01:29:08,724 --> 01:29:10,758
<i>She said she may be interested.</i>

1208
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:14,865
Now, again...
It's, it's a chance.

1209
01:29:18,201 --> 01:29:19,670
Who is she?

1210
01:29:21,071 --> 01:29:22,540
Keeps it anonymous.

1211
01:29:25,842 --> 01:29:30,712
I understand the place
you're in right now. I do.

1212
01:29:30,714 --> 01:29:34,282
<i>See this? Defiant Nation '92.</i>

1213
01:29:34,284 --> 01:29:36,351
- <i>No shit.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1214
01:29:36,353 --> 01:29:38,185
<i>And if I told my old lady
I wanted out,</i>

1215
01:29:38,187 --> 01:29:40,020
she would have told
everyone else

1216
01:29:40,022 --> 01:29:42,856
and they would have
murdered me and my kids.

1217
01:29:42,858 --> 01:29:44,626
So what did I do?

1218
01:29:44,628 --> 01:29:46,727
I kidnapped my own sons

1219
01:29:46,729 --> 01:29:48,363
and I filed for legal custody

1220
01:29:48,365 --> 01:29:50,164
and I started talking.

1221
01:29:50,166 --> 01:29:52,803
<i>Now, I didn't even have
what you got here.</i>

1222
01:29:56,607 --> 01:29:57,575
When?

1223
01:30:04,348 --> 01:30:07,248
Be at this hotel
tomorrow night.

1224
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:09,985
It's an eight-hour drive.

1225
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:12,052
<i>Under the name "Manning."</i>

1226
01:30:12,054 --> 01:30:16,159
<i>It's safe.
Talk to no one, okay?</i>

1227
01:30:17,661 --> 01:30:19,030
I gotta go.

1228
01:30:20,897 --> 01:30:22,062
What if I take all this
stuff off

1229
01:30:22,064 --> 01:30:23,834
and I'm still a piece of shit?

1230
01:30:25,768 --> 01:30:27,838
<i>There's only
one way to find out.</i>

1231
01:30:47,957 --> 01:30:49,923
<i>Is there anything
else for the girls?</i>

1232
01:30:49,925 --> 01:30:51,793
There's a box for the girls
here.

1233
01:30:51,795 --> 01:30:54,395
What about Boss's box?
Do you have that?

1234
01:30:54,397 --> 01:30:57,699
Uh, what do... H-he needs to go
out. Did he go out yet?

1235
01:30:57,701 --> 01:30:59,400
- I thought you took him out.
- I didn't take him out.

1236
01:30:59,402 --> 01:31:01,705
Okay, he's with the girls.
I'll grab him.

1237
01:31:04,707 --> 01:31:07,374
<i>Come on, Boss, let's pee
in the night. Come on.</i>

1238
01:31:07,376 --> 01:31:09,213
Good boy. Let's go. Good boy.

1239
01:31:10,781 --> 01:31:12,946
Come on.

1240
01:31:12,948 --> 01:31:14,884
Go get it, go get it.

1241
01:31:16,952 --> 01:31:19,788
- Okay, this box is done.
- Babe...

1242
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:24,426
<i>Girls! Girls!</i>

1243
01:31:24,428 --> 01:31:27,227
<i>Get to the bathroom now.
Just like the drills.</i>

1244
01:31:32,302 --> 01:31:33,771
Oh, my God.

1245
01:31:36,973 --> 01:31:38,707
Julie...

1246
01:31:40,977 --> 01:31:42,043
<i>You okay?</i>

1247
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,446
<i>Stay down! Stay down!</i>

1248
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:02,699
- <i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>
- <i>Come on, now.</i>

1249
01:32:04,835 --> 01:32:06,501

Stay there...</i>

1250
01:32:06,503 --> 01:32:08,837
<i>Baby, where are you?
Oh, God.</i>

1251
01:32:08,839 --> 01:32:11,071
<i>Bryon...
Bryon, where is she?</i>

1252
01:32:11,073 --> 01:32:13,710
- <i>Baby!</i>
- Get back, get back.

1253
01:32:15,512 --> 01:32:17,412
<i>You're okay, you're okay.</i>

1254
01:32:17,414 --> 01:32:19,114
<i>Remember that time I took you
to that restaurant?</i>

1255
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:20,215
And this started happening,
I took you outside

1256
01:32:20,217 --> 01:32:21,983
and we-we were on the bench.

1257
01:32:21,985 --> 01:32:23,251
And it worked, right?

1258
01:32:23,253 --> 01:32:24,519
Okay, okay,

1259

01:32:29,192 --> 01:32:32,226
Oh, you got...
You okay?

1262
01:32:32,228 --> 01:32:34,831

Yeah?

1263
01:32:40,937 --> 01:32:42,073
<i>Okay.</i>

1264
01:32:46,442 --> 01:32:48,243

1267
01:32:57,387 --> 01:33:00,157
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1268
01:34:15,999 --> 01:34:18,166
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1269
01:34:18,168 --> 01:34:20,400
Motherfuckers.

1270
01:34:20,402 --> 01:34:21,571
Fuck!

1271
01:34:29,411 --> 01:34:30,944
No, go-go back inside. Go...

1272
01:34:30,946 --> 01:34:32,145
Don't let the kids come out.
Go ba...

1273
01:34:32,147 --> 01:34:34,481
- Go back inside!
- Desiree!

1274
01:34:34,483 --> 01:34:36,484
Desiree, get the girls inside!

1275
01:34:36,486 --> 01:34:38,255
Get them inside!

1276
01:34:56,171 --> 01:34:58,442
Oh, shi... Shit! Fuck!

1277
01:35:07,517 --> 01:35:09,249
Oh, I'll fuckin' kill...

1278
01:35:09,251 --> 01:35:11,953
Oh, I'll fuckin' kill...

1279
01:35:11,955 --> 01:35:13,520
Fuck you!

1280
01:35:13,522 --> 01:35:15,558
<i>You fucking cowards!</i>

1281
01:35:24,968 --> 01:35:27,034
<i>I got you, baby.</i>

1282
01:35:29,238 --> 01:35:31,342
Yeah, I got you.

1283
01:35:36,979 --> 01:35:38,314
I got you.

1284
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:43,554
We're gonna be okay.
Okay, baby?

1285
01:35:45,287 --> 01:35:47,223
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

1286
01:36:11,246 --> 01:36:12,548
It's okay.

1287
01:36:47,517 --> 01:36:49,420
Wait, there.

1288
01:36:51,021 --> 01:36:52,089
Wait.

1289
01:36:53,622 --> 01:36:55,058
You okay?

1290
01:37:32,327 --> 01:37:33,660
Okay.

1291
01:37:40,236 --> 01:37:43,206
Hey. Hey, baby.

1292
01:37:44,506 --> 01:37:47,510
You okay? Come here.

1293
01:37:49,612 --> 01:37:51,115
Oh...

1294
01:37:52,682 --> 01:37:54,184
Okay.

1295
01:37:56,452 --> 01:37:57,521
Okay?

1296
01:38:12,102 --> 01:38:13,767
Don't answer it! Don't a...
Do-don't pick it up.

1297
01:38:13,769 --> 01:38:15,802
<i>Don't pick it up. Leave it.
Leave it. Leave it.</i>

1298
01:38:15,804 --> 01:38:17,370
- Babe, I know...
- <i>Let it ring, let it ring.</i>

1299
01:38:17,372 --> 01:38:19,373
- <i>Don't pick it up.</i>
- I know.

1300
01:38:21,277 --> 01:38:23,514
Just let it go.
Let it, let it ring.

1301
01:38:49,138 --> 01:38:50,373
Hey, what are you doin'?

1302
01:38:51,273 --> 01:38:54,141
The pool.

1303
01:38:54,143 --> 01:38:57,177
Half an hour only, okay?
Stay where we can see you.

1304
01:39:26,643 --> 01:39:28,312
Be right back.

1305
01:39:53,469 --> 01:39:56,537
- Desi. Desi, get out.
- What for?

1306
01:39:56,539 --> 01:39:57,805
Just get out,
I need to talk to you.

1307
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,520
Where'd you get that tattoo?

1308
01:40:10,887 --> 01:40:13,721
- Black Eye Social.
- You're lying.

1309
01:40:13,723 --> 01:40:15,388
- I know what that means...
- What are you talking about?

1310
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:17,557
- This is Freya.
- So who you talking to?

1311
01:40:17,559 --> 01:40:19,360
I'd never get one
of your stupid designs.

1312
01:40:19,362 --> 01:40:20,794
No, no, no, no, no...

1313
01:40:20,796 --> 01:40:22,562
It's a Norse Goddess, you idiot.

1314
01:40:22,564 --> 01:40:24,765
Are you talking to them? Is that
how they know... How th...

1315
01:40:24,767 --> 01:40:26,266
- Is that how they...
- I didn't do anything wrong.

1316
01:40:26,268 --> 01:40:27,568
Is that why they keep
showing up...

1317
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:29,337
I'm not lying,
I didn't do anything wrong.

1318
01:40:29,339 --> 01:40:31,004
- Who did that to you?
- I didn't do anything wrong.

1319
01:40:31,006 --> 01:40:32,907
- Hmm?
- Black Eye Social.

1320
01:40:32,909 --> 01:40:34,542
I didn't do anything wrong.

1321
01:40:34,544 --> 01:40:35,775
<i>It's a Norse Goddess.</i>

1322
01:40:35,777 --> 01:40:37,845
Hey! Bryon!

1323
01:40:37,847 --> 01:40:38,945
If you can tell me
where we're going...

1324
01:40:38,947 --> 01:40:40,248
Help!

1325
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:41,548
- Is that why they keep...
- Help!

1326
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:44,385
- <i>Get off me!</i>
- Stay there, baby.

1327
01:40:44,387 --> 01:40:47,788
- Ah! He's hurting me.
- Hey, buddy, you're hurting her.

1328
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:49,457
I'll fucking kill you, huh?

1329
01:40:49,459 --> 01:40:51,258
You're gonna fucking get
in the middle of this, huh?

1330
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:53,463
You wanna fucking get
in the middle of shit, do you?

1331
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,533
Fucking stay right there!

<i>they fucking do, okay?
No...</i>

1335
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,573
Get away from her!

1336
01:41:05,575 --> 01:41:07,374
- Stop!
- <i>She's a teenager!</i>

1337
01:41:07,376 --> 01:41:08,909
Why do you think
they keep showing up?

1338
01:41:08,911 --> 01:41:11,712
I don't care.
I don't fucking care.

1339
01:41:11,714 --> 01:41:14,547
Get away. Get away from us.

1340
01:41:14,549 --> 01:41:17,051
You're fucking insane.
You're crazy.

1341
01:41:17,053 --> 01:41:18,985
She's terrified of the...

1342
01:41:18,987 --> 01:41:20,954
<i>I got her that fucking tat.</i>

1343
01:41:20,956 --> 01:41:22,657
Wait, I'm sorry.

1344
01:41:22,659 --> 01:41:23,724
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- Get away!

1345
01:41:23,726 --> 01:41:25,392
I told you...

1346
01:41:25,394 --> 01:41:26,961
You fucking

Get away from us.
Get away from...

I was tryin' to get her
to understand.

1353
01:41:38,741 --> 01:41:40,574
We could've all fuckin' died,
Julie.

1354
01:41:40,576 --> 01:41:42,342
- We almost fucking did die.
- It's over.

1355
01:41:42,344 --> 01:41:45,615
- We almost died...
- Get the fuck out of our lives!

I don't know if I can do this.

1370

Show everyone

I'm gonna wait for you outside.

00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,853
- F.B.I.! Don’t move!
- W-W-Wait!

5
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,828
<i>Go on! Do the door!</i>

6
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,709
Move! Move! Move! Move!

7
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,479
He’s in the closet!
He’s in the closet!

8
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,948
<i>In the closet! Hit him! Hit him!</i>

9
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,386
Open it. Open it.

10
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,923
<i>Open it! Give me the fuckin’ –</i>
<i>Give me the fuckin’ light!</i>

11
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,074
<i>Give me an update from the medic.</i>
<i>How are my guys?</i>

12
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,712
<i>We’ll do it floor by floor.</i>
<i>Now tear this building down.</i>

13
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,956
<i>The whole squad’s assembled, sir.</i>
<i>I got ’em in here as soon as you called.</i>

14
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,925
Nobody gets in.

15
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,626
Be seated.

16
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:31,898
The mayor has got every black citizen and every
black citizen’s group in this city tearing at him.

17
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,901
He’s got a black man
that the F.B.I. is trying to lynch.

18
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:39,005
We’ve got people going around, yelling
“Black Panthers! Government Assassination Squad!”

19
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,008
<i>Excuse me, sir. If you’re talking about</i>
<i>Robert Randolph, he’s a drug dealer.</i>

20
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,745
- We’ve had him on our books.
- I believe the man is speaking.

21
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,247
I need this Randolph.
I need to bring him in.

22
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:51,217
<i>Now, the mayor’s called off the F.B.I.</i>
<i>They’re off. They’re out of it.</i>

23
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,554
I need you to go out there,
find this man and bring him in alive.

24
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,058
Have you got anything?
Can you give me something?

25
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,560
- <i>I’ve got banks, I’ve got promotions.</i>
- What do you think?

26
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,764
He yanked you off the case once, he’ll do it again.
It’s a can of worms.

27
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,066
Just lay back and watch it like a play.

28
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,534
I don’t know what else I can say.

29
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,536
- Sir.
- Yeah?

30
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,240
Sir, we, uh– My partner.
We had this Randolph, my partner and I.

31
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:18,611
His brother-in-law, a year or two ago, Willie Sims,
who were very tight in the old days.

32
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,613
I think we can get to Randolph through –

33
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:24,084
- You know the whereabouts of this Sims?
- Well, yes, sir. He’s a creature of habit.

34
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,554
- How long have you known this?
And why didn’t you come forward?
- Well, sir, we were yanked off the case.

35
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,225
- The F.B.I. – You know, the F.B.I. –
- You could’ve passed a tip to them.

36
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:36,496
Well, sir, they say never kiss an F.B.I. agent
because then you might have to take him to dinner.

37
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,965
I don’t get it.
I don’t get the fuckin’ humor.

38
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,668
- I –
- We got a black man killed. The mayor’s besieged.

39
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,672
You don’t come forward till Mr. Walker’s handing
out promotions, and you come up with a joke.

40
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,942
It’s no joke, mister.
If it was a white man, wouldn’t be no joke.

41
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,944
- Sir –
- You work for this city?

42
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,346
Are you a member of this police force
or aren’t you?

43
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,450
Yes, sir. We were told to stand down.
The lieu passed it down. This case didn’t exist.

44
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,021
Do you have something? What do you have?
We got the mayor out there hanging in the breeze.

45
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,156
Yes, sir.
I’m saying, but the F.B.I. –

46
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,158
What have you got?

47
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,694
I’m saying,
I think we can bring the man in.

48
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,330
Well, then you bring him in.

49
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,636
- Who was that?
- Detective Robert Gold.

50
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:20,640
He’s our hostage negotiator. Good cop.
Fine record. Twenty-two citations for valor.

51
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:24,210
Look, you have to bear with me
because I am not gonna eat this attitude.

52
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,713
- We got the city burnin’ –
- Sir, I’m sorry if I said something –

53
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,951
Hey, pally, I don’t need you to wax my car.
I need you to go out and do what you’re paid to do.

54
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,888
- Mr. Walker, I’m sorry to subject you to this.
- <i>Listen, let’s just find this guy.</i>

55
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,590
Dale, there’ll be
a lot of reporters out there.

56
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:40,426
- Listen to what the man’s telling you.
- Mr. Patterson! Mr. Patterson!

57
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,163
- Nobody’s asking you to eat attitude here!
- Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

58
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,666
- What did you say?
- I said, do your job.

59
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:49,335
- Mister, I’m trying to do my job.
- And you got an answer for everything.
Is that it, smart guy?

60
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,672
Mr. Gold?
Detective Robert Gold?

61
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,474
Hostage negotiator.
Barracks room lawyer. Is that it?

62
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,710
- No. I – Sir.
- Bobby.

63
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,413
<i>- Mr. Patterson.</i>
<i>- Bobby.</i>

64
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,415
Sir. Sir!

65
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,651
<i>- It seems you’re –</i>
- I’m what?

66
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,653
I’m through with you, Mr. Gold.

67
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,421
- Hey!
- “Hey”?

68
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,693
- How would you like to be suspended?
- How’d you like to be Queen for a Day?

69
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,695
- Little kike.
- What?

70
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,764
- Don’t you move.
- What did you say? What did you fuckin’ say?

71
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,933
You wanna step out in the alley,
I’ll tell you what I said.

72
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,737
Step out into the alley?
You fuckin’ faggot, I’ll kill your ass right here!

73
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,806
- Sully!
- You talk to my partner that way?

74
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,474
- Tim, leave it.
- Do you know what this man has done in the line?

75
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,043
Stand down!

76
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,320
- I’m sorry, Bob.
- Hey.

77

Ah, fuck him, huh?
Any self-respect, he’d work for a living!

- Ah, fuck him. Right?
- Yeah.

79
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,701
Good morning.

80
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,207
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

81
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,710
Fucker had no call
to get on you like that.

82
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,713
Fuckin’ case wasn’t even a case
till the F.B.I. came on it.

83
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,150
Two-bit, two-bag pusher till the F.B.I.
turned the fuckin’ guy into Young John Hitler.

84
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,754
Hey, we could’ve found him in a heartbeat,
the fuckin’ F.B.I. don’t come on it.

85
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,057
Hey, give me a couple of serious Irish cops,
cigars in their mouths...

- That’s right. That’s right.

87
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,495
and spare me the fuckin’ F.B.I.

88
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,498
Hey, F.B.I. don’t put you
on their Ten Most Wanted list...

89
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,802
till they know where you are
and how long you’re gonna be there.

90
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,570
Uh-huh.
Who is this guy, Tim?

91
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,573
Willie Sims. This is the brother-in-law
of our Mr. Randolph.

92
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,710
- We had him 1979, 198 –
- We had him all the fuckin’ time.

93
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:40,313
<i>It’s a piece of cake.</i>
<i>He lives at the boys’ gym down on Federal.</i>

94
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,749
<i>- Boxer.</i>
- Him – Yeah, him and Randolph.

95
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,752
It’s a fuckin’ walk. You want this Randolph,
we go down to this gym.

96
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,754
He’s not there, we get Sims.

97
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:51,091
- We tail him, we nail him, we turn him over, we shake him, <i>he</i> gives us Randolph.
- - <i>That’s right.</i>

98
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,694

- I’m gonna get the stuff.
- <i>Hey, Bob.</i>

103
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,044
Don’t let him get you down.

104
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,480
What, are you guys all going out?

105
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,482
- That’s right.
- Don’t forget your gun.

106
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,052
- For what? To protect myself?
- <i>That’s right.</i>

107
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,857
Homicide. Detective Gold.

108
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,859
<i>Hi, Bobby.</i>

<i>The F.B.I.’s been taken off</i>
<i>the Robert Randolph case. Our plan?</i>

110
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,666

- Now, where’s my shells?

112
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,172
Well, dear, they put us on the big one.

113
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,875
What, are you going out
to conquer France?

114
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,878
Yeah. What do you got?

115
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:49,916
Walter B. Wells. Killed his wife and kiddie
this a.m. with this here deer rifle.

116
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,854
Well, that sounds like an interesting case.
What did you do, apprehend him?

117
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,056
<i>Yeah, we got him. Mighty hunter.</i>

118
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,325
- Could we get some ink in here?
- What, did you mistake ’em for a deer?

119
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,395
Hey, all we gotta do is catch ’em.
We don’t gotta figure ’em out, thank God.

120
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:05,398
- Did you think they were a deer?
- Yes, I thought they were a deer.

121
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,735
What’d you kill ’em for, pal?
What’d you shoot ’em for, pal?

122
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,737
- I did it to protect them.
- “Protect them.”

123

- Well, they’re safe now, wouldn’t you say?

It’s okay.
We got him. We got him.

139
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,754
Stupid son of a bitch!

00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,592
Oh, Christ.

142
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,096
You tore my fuckin’ holster.
What the fuck do you wanna do that for?

143
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,566
- You okay, Bob?
- What the fuck do you wanna do that for?

144
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,269
- I wanted your gun.
- Why didn’t you just say so?

145
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,505
- What’d you want the gun for?
- I wanted to kill myself.

146
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,776
Bates, Brown, in my office.

147
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,879
- Are you okay, Bobby?
- No, I’m fine, Lieu.

148
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,882
- Somebody get him a drink of water.
- I got it.

149
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,752
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

150
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,856
What’d I ever do to you? Huh?
What the fuck did I ever do to you?

151
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,624
- You stupid son of a bitch.
<i>- I’m sorry.</i>

152
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:42,528
You tore my holster, and I got work to do.
What the fuck did I ever do to you?

153
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,799
- Nothing.
- And I stood up for you, didn’t I?

154
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,801
Yes. Y-You did.

155
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,007
- Thank you for your help.
- Uh-huh.

156
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:57,177
Perhaps someday I could help you.

157
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:00,480
Now, how can you help me?

158
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,482
Perhaps...

159
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,551
someday I could tell you
the nature of evil.

160
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:10,891
W-Would you like to know how to –
to solve the problem of evil?

161
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,895
No, man, ’cause if I did,
then I’d be out of a job.

162
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,963
Let’s go to work.

So he called you one,

Either a piece of cake or a slice of life.
You notice that?

176
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,204
- Yeah, I’ve remarked that. Ain’t that the truth?
- That is the truth.

177
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,707
We could’ve brought the son of a bitch in
with a knock on the door.

178

- Well, let’s go bring him in then.

Some of that police work
that people talk about.

- Hmm.

Guys? What guys?
It’s just my partner and the dog.

you, your partner’s star number.

<i>Thank you. Y-You were never here.</i>

<i>If I move, man,</i>

Nothin’ to it.

250
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,133

<i>Yeah.</i>

Nice and easy.

253

- Everybody’s your friend.
- <i>Be careful, man.</i>

254
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,749
Shh.

255
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,785
Attaboy.

256
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,587
Chain him outside.

257
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,656
- What a thing, huh?
- Uh-huh.

258

Thank you, man. Thank you.

- It’s all right.

260
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:19,499
Don’t touch the phone.
You gotta call, call outside.

261

Okay, move it back, fellas.
Move it back. Thank you.

264
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:29,870
I know why they waste her, man –
’cause she got that fortune in her basement.

265
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:34,007
That Jew broad. You want me to help you?
I can help you ’cause I know why they did her, man.

266
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:37,510
Officer, take everybody’s name and address.
Don’t shoo anyone off.

267
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:40,513
Fella hanging around could be the guy.
You understand? The killer.

268
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,515
- Yes, sir.
- Nobody goes in or out of the building.

269
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,752
You don’t touch nothin’ in there,
and you hang tight till your sergeant arrives.

270
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:48,855
<i>Excuse me, Officer. See, I know that she had</i>
<i>the fortune down in that basement.</i>

271
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,857
- <i>Hang tight till my sergeant arrives.</i>
- That’s right.

272
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:53,860
- Even when I was young I knew that.
This is why they killed her.
- <i>Thank you, Detective. Thanks a lot.</i>

273
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:57,363
- I know what I’m talkin’ about
’cause I been in this neighborhood all my life.
- I gotta get out of here.

274
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,866
- That’s why they killed her.
- <i>Sorry, ma’am. No one is supposed to get through.</i>

275
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,868
- Please. Who’s in charge here?
- It’s not my case.

276
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:04,938
- That’s my grandmother in there.
Can you help me? Please let us through.
- It’s not my case.

277
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,007
<i>Folks, nobody gets by.</i>

278
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,877
- Central. Detective Gold.
- Central, okay.

279
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,714

281
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:19,285
- Please, can you help me?
- The sergeant’ll be here in a minute.

282
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:21,655
My grandmother, is she –
What’s happened to her?

283
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:25,491
<i>- Gold, your 10-20. Say again.</i>
- 12th and Prescott.

284
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,661
Your grandmother
owns the variety store?

285
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:30,130
Is she dead?

286
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,632
The woman inside is dead.
Yes, ma’am.

287
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,236
Oh, God.

288
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,439
<i>Relay this pickup to Sullivan.</i>
<i>As soon as the car’s here, I’m on my way.</i>

289
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,442
- <i>Central, okay.</i>
- Officer, I want to see her.

290
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:45,245
I’m sorry, sir.
This is not my case.

291
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,953
- No, I can’t get stuck here.
- Stay with the car.

292
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,620
What do we got?

293
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,623
Yes, sir, uh, we got a homicide.

294
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:01,294
- Elderly woman shot. This is the family.
- The family?

295
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,629
- Who are you?
- Detective Gold, Homicide.

296
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,966
- You got here quick.
- Oh, no, sir. I, uh –

297
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,768
Oh. First officer?

298
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,704
Oh.

299
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:14,174
What’s this family doing in this neighborhood?
I don’t get it.

300
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:17,510
Officer Jones.

301
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,880
- Captain, I gotta get out of here.
- Take these people in.

302
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,882
- Have them I.D. the body.
- I gotta get out of here.

303
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,051
Let me run the precinct, okay?
You caught the case.

304
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,354
Sir, my partner and I, we got
something heavy coming down right now.

305
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,824
- Over at the boxing gym.
- Yes, sir.

306
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,959
I just heard on the radio.
It happened.

307
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:35,495
You caught the case, you got the case.
Do your job.

308
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:39,933
<i>Sir, my name is Captain Briggs.</i>
<i>This detective will be taking you aside.</i>

309
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,202
- Officer!
- Sir.

310
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:45,939
Go to the store next door. They got an office.
Tell ’em we’re taking it as a command post.

311
00:21:46,006 --> 00:21:48,875
- Everybody’s names. Everybody goes downtown.
- Yes, sir.

312
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:51,111
- <i>What do we got?</i>
- We got a homicide.

313
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:54,815
And there’s a very pretty .45 Colt in there I don’t
wanna see disappearing in some cop’s locker.

314
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,483
- So tag it first, okay? Wait a minute.
- Gotcha.

315
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,020
All right, sir, would you like to
come in for a moment?

316
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,388
And please, while you’re in the store,
touch nothing.

317
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,730
<i>There’s nothing to see here, folks.</i>
<i>Why don’t you go home?</i>

318
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:14,634
It never stops.
It never stops, does it?

319
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:19,605
“It never stops.”
What is it that never stops?

320
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:22,876
Against the Jews.

321
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,248
Yeah, that’s right.

322
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,251
<i>Because you know she had</i>
<i>that shit down in her basement.</i>

323
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,019
The, um – The old woman?

324
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,956
- Tell him about the old woman.
- That’s what we were talking about.

325
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:40,060
You were gonna tell me.
You said you were gonna help us find her killer.

326
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:43,063
- I was gonna tell you what they shot her for.
- Uh-huh.

327
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,865
The fortune in her basement.

328
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,867
- <i>They killed her for her fortune?</i>
- That’s right.

329
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,634
- Did you see this guy?
- <i>No.</i>

330
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:51,304
- I was in school.
- It was a school day.

331
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,306
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Willie Sims.

332
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,776
- Yeah, man, I remember you.
- We got him.

333
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,878
I remember you.
You the talkin’ man.

334
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,612
Willie Sims. Yeah.
How are you?

335
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,614
- As you see, man.
- Let’s go.

336
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:04,584
Look, what are they doing to me?
What do <i>you</i> want with me?

337
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,987
- You missed it.
- What the hell do you want with me?

338
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:10,156
- You missed it, Bob.
- Why are you harassin’ me?

339
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,226
Got him at the gym, just like you said.
What happened to you?

340
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:15,762
Got pulled off the case.

341
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,232
Bullshit you did.

342
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:24,537
I’m stuck. I’m supposed to
babysit this candy store.

343
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:28,541
<i>Back on the corner, you were</i>
<i>saying something had already happened.</i>

344
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:31,678
- It’s your case.
- I don’t know. Yeah.

345
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:36,149
Baby, we need you to turn this guy over.
We need the mouthpiece to sweet-talk his ass.

346
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:37,617
- Lieu?
- Yes.

347
00:23:37,684 --> 00:23:41,321
- My father needs to talk to you.
<i>- We’ll take care of it. Officer!</i>

348
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,323
- Yes, sir!
- My father needs you.

349
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,358
- Would you see Miss Klein home?
- Yes, sir.

350
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:48,528
- I assure you we’ll take care of it.
- Ma’am?

351
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,596
- I need to talk to you.
- One minute, please.

352
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:53,199
Lieu, we’re about to crack this Sims.

353
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:57,203
I’m sorry, Bobby. I got a call. Downtown.
You live with this candy store.

354
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,941
<i>Bullshit aside, Lieu, we need him.</i>
<i>We’re going in Mutt and Jeff, and we need Bobby.</i>

355
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,944
- We need the Orator.
- I got the call. He’s off the case.

356
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,279
- What do you call this? Loyalty?
- Yes, boss?

357
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:09,683
Come with me.
I’m sorry, Bobby. I got a call.

358
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,618
<i>Downtown, the Jewish guys,</i>
<i>they got this clout.</i>

359
00:24:12,686 --> 00:24:17,190
The doctor wants you. You were there.
You’re his people. You’re on the case.

360
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:19,192
I’m his people?

361
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:21,294
I thought I was your people, Lieu.

362
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:23,797
I come up with the idea,
trap the guy in.

363
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:25,999
Lieu, I come up with the brother.
Hey –

364
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:28,468
- I’m sorry, Bobby.
- Lieu, I’m in it from the get.

365
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:31,805
I’m sorry. About the procedurals,
go ahead and clear them off your desk.

366
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,807
You’re sorry? What am I,
a fucking jumping bean?

367
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:35,976
- I’m sorry.
- What, I’m your backup girl?

368
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,478
I’m trying to follow orders, Lieu,
and I’m gettin’ whiplash.

369
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:41,481
Why don’t you just send me to the airport?
What did I do to you?

370
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:44,484
- It’s nothing personal, Bobby.
- What I’m sayin’, Lieu, perhaps it should be.

371
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,487
Kid just gave up his brother.
Does not like police stations.

372
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,823
- Just gave us Randolph.
- You got an address?

373
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,825
Got the whole thing.
Let’s go get ’im.

374
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,827
- Yo, you want vests?
- Yeah.

375
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:56,830
Where are you goin’?
You’re on the candy store case.

376
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:59,199
- He’s on top of it.
- The fuck he’s on top of it!

377
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,201
- I’m going for coffee.
- Coffee? Bullshit!

378
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:04,771
No! You wanna run on this other case,
it’s my ass. You understand?

379
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:07,774
This guy is heavy downtown.
Don’t lie to me.

380
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,243
- The candy store. You got it.
- Lieu –

381
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,379
Nothing you say or do can convince me,
so shut the fuck up.

382
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:15,381
- It’s not right.
- Get outta here!

383
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:17,918
- Good-bye, Sully.
- That’s right.

384
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:21,755
- What do you got on the candy store case?
- Yeah, I’m on top of it.

385
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:24,758
- Tell me.
- Some kids say she kept a fortune
in her basement.

386
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,760
- Yeah?
- I got the witnesses lined up.

387
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:29,763
- Lieutenant, if I go back to the 212 –
- Yes. One moment.

388
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,466
I’m sorry to pull you off the flash case, Bobby.
I appreciate what you’re doing for me.

389
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,468
- That’s all right, Lieu.
- I got three calls.

390
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:39,139
- The guy, Dr. Klein – You’ll call him?
- I’m on it right now.

391
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,141
- Thank you, Bob.
- It’s all right, Lieu.

392
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:44,444
- No, thank you. I’ll make it up to you someday.
- It’s all part of the job.

393
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,812
That’s right.

394
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:48,381
- Yes? What?
- <i>I’m sorry to keep going over this.</i>

395
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:51,785
<i>That’s okay.</i>
<i>We’ll go over it from the jump.</i>

396
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,961
- Fuck him.
- Let’s get out of here.

397
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:59,019
- Lovely day for it.
- All right.

398
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:11,798
Excuse me. I’m trying to find this address.
You know where that might be?

399
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,499
This one right here?

400
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:24,971
How come you always gotta be
the first one through the door?

401
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:28,809
So brazen.

402
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:30,971
You wanna kill my baby.

403
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:38,211
You come here to kill my child.

404
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,181
- <i>I’m coming in, Bob.</i>
- Yo, come in.

405
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:48,288
This the broad?

406
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,358
<i>Joint’s deserted.</i>
<i>Guy ain’t here.</i>

407
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,695
<i>Sullivan coming in!</i>

408
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:06,172
Where is he?

409
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:09,142
I should kill my baby
that I brought into the world?

410
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,714
White folks.
Why would that be?

411
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,850
- <i>Your baby’s a murderer.</i>
- He never hurt nobody.

412
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,852
Now, that’s just not the facts.

413
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,223
He never hurt no one.
Now you got him out there runnin’ for his life.

414
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:27,393
We gotta get to him. We got a few days to do it.
We can bring him in.

415
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,530
<i>I mean, we don’t find him,</i>
<i>we gotta call back in the F.B.I.</i>

416
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,532
<i>F.B.I.’s gonna kill his ass.</i>

417
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:36,502
<i>That’s right. We’re here to</i>
<i>cut you a deal that the federal boys won’t.</i>

418
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:39,172
- So, what do you wanna do?
<i>- Tell him what you wanna do.</i>

419
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:41,507
Get out of my motherfuckin’ room.

420
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:44,778
- Get out of my fuckin’ room!
- Hey, bitch, you don’t tell us.

421
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:48,815
You don’t tell us a goddamn thing!
We tell you!

422
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:51,852
<i>Your boy killed two cops. You think</i>
<i>we’re just gonna sit here and chat with you?</i>

423
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:54,587
We’re wasting our time. Get her up.
Get her the fuck up!

424
00:30:54,655 --> 00:30:56,723
- Get her outta here!
- Give me a minute, will ya?

425
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:00,426
Two dead cops! What the fuck are you –

426
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:02,663
Give me a fuckin’ minute!

427
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:05,531
A minute is something
that we don’t got.

428
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:08,201
- <i>Talkin’ to a stone wall.</i>
- Uh-huh.

429
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:11,371
- You’re wasting your time, Bob.
- I’ll be the judge of that.

430
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:13,707
- <i>Why do you do this shit?</i>
- Shut up!

431
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:19,645
We got to find him.
Don’t do this the hard way.

432
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:22,648
<i>Look at me.</i>
<i>Now, don’t do this the hard way.</i>

433
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:24,651
- <i>We can help you.</i>
- Mmm.

434
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,954
<i>It’s a bad beat and you’re stuck in it,</i>
<i>and it’s gonna be some crying.</i>

435
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:30,390
But our way is the easy way.

436
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:33,894
Listen to me.

437
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,962
We need your son...

438
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:39,900
but we don’t need him dead.

439
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:43,236
You want him alive?
Work with us.

440
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:45,238
We got to bring him in.

441
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:48,408
- You want to kill him.
- We need to take him.

442
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:51,745
But we need him alive.
That’s the job we were given to do.

443
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:54,748
That’s why they gave it to the cops
’stead of the F.B.I.

444
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:58,184
Our job is to bring him down alive.

445
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,687
<i>That’s what they sent us for.</i>

446
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:03,356
<i>It’s that simple.</i>
<i>That’s what it is.</i>

447
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:08,762
Listen to me.

448
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,764
I know that it stinks.

449
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:14,267
I know that there’s so much death in the world.
I know that it’s full of hate, mama.

450
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:17,437
I know that it all turns out wrong.

451
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:19,505
Here we are.

452
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:22,709
Here we are.

453
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,711
We’re the garbagemen.

454
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:27,781
You think I don’t know that?
I know that.

455
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:31,184
Looking for something to love.

456
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:34,855
You got something to love.
You got your boys.

457
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:36,923
That’s something.

458
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,661
Look in my eyes.

459
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:44,865
I want to save your son.

460
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:47,367
Before God...

461
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,970
I want to save your boy.

462
00:32:51,872 --> 00:32:53,874
Will you help me?

463
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:00,313
- <i>Uh, Bob?</i>
- Not now.

464
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,315
- <i>The lieutenant.</i>
- Not now.

465
00:33:02,382 --> 00:33:05,551
He needs you on the phone.
He says <i>now.</i>

466
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:14,094
Time’s running out.
Let’s ride, mama.

467
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,163
- What the fuck does he want?
- It’s the Yids.

468
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,365
- Blow ’em off.
- The doctor. Somebody took a shot at –

469
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:22,435
- Somebody took a shot at –
- That’s what they said.

470
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,840
Bullshit. Bullshit!

471
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:34,014
One of the men who was at
the medical examiner’s office...

472
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,217
assured me they will release it
before the end of the day.

473
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:44,758
- What is it?
- They say a shot fired at them.

474
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,761
Some guy on the roof.

475
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:54,034
- A shot fired? Yes or no?
- I don’t know. Didn’t hit nothin’ if it did.

476
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,703
- Well, who heard it?
- The lady.

477
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,707
The lady? What lady?
Get the lady in here so she can show me.

478
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:03,276
- <i>I’ll</i> show you.
- You’ll show me what, sir?

479
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:05,278
- Who made the call?
- I made the call.

480
00:34:05,345 --> 00:34:07,781
- What are we looking at? What’s going on here?
- It happened here.

481
00:34:07,848 --> 00:34:10,884
What happened? Give me this number
right now. My partner – Get him.

482
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:12,953
- There was a man on the roof.
- Uh-huh.

483
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,956
- And my wife heard a shot.
- Uh-huh. She heard a shot.

484
00:34:16,022 --> 00:34:17,758
<i>Yes, she did.</i>

485
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:21,895
Would she know what a shot sounds like?
How would she know that?

486
00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:25,298
- My wife heard a shot.
- <i>There was a shot on the roof.</i>

487
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,934
There was a man on the roof.
A man on the roof.

488
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:30,136
- Yes, ma’am.
- No, no, I’m not making it up.

489
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:32,138
It happened.
There was shooting.

490
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:35,108
- Ma’am, I don’t know any reason why anyone –
- <i>That’s right.</i>

491
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:39,145
You don’t, do you? But I see that you feel that,
what – you’re dealing with hysterical Jews?

492
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:41,147
I’m making it up.
Is that right?

493
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:43,684
<i>We’re always making it up.</i>
<i>Is that right?</i>

494
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,419
It’s all right, dear.
Let me tell you one thing.

495
00:34:46,486 --> 00:34:50,523
- There <i>was</i> a man on the roof.
- Look, can I talk to you for a second?

496
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:57,597
Look, Doctor, why would anybody
be shooting at you?

497
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,600
- You follow me?
- Do I follow you?

498
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:04,270
Look, you – You’re under
a lot of stress today – your tragedy.

499
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:07,040
I’m sorry for you,
what happened to your mother.

500
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:11,845
I’m gonna station a man on the roof.
You keep away from this side of the house. Okay?

501
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:14,147
It’s always a fantasy, isn’t it?

502
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:16,950
A fantasy? What’s a fantasy?
I don’t get you.

503
00:35:17,017 --> 00:35:19,052
When someone wants to hurt the Jews.

504
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,722
I’ve got nothing against the Jews, Doctor.
<i>I’m</i> a Jew.

505
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:26,026
And I’ll tell you something else –
When the fantasy is true, when we’ve been killed...

506
00:35:26,092 --> 00:35:30,530
then you say, “What a coincidence that
at the same time we were being paranoid...

507
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,733
someone was coincidentally
trying to hurt us.”

508
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,736
What can I have
against the Jewish people, Doctor?

509
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,071
I’m sorry what happened
to your mother.

510
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:41,341
You say you saw someone on the roof.
I’m putting a man there.

511
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:44,344
You tell me what more
you think that I can do. All right?

512
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,147
I’m just trying to do my job.
I’m sorry.

513
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:51,885
You’re trying to do your job?
Let’s be frank, shall we? Can we do that?

514
00:35:51,952 --> 00:35:54,020
- Sir, do you want to be frank?
- Yes, I do.

515
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:57,057
- I don’t get the whole fuckin’ thing.
- It amounts to this. My mother was killed.

516
00:35:57,123 --> 00:36:01,561
You’re assigned to the case. I called downtown.
They say you’re a good detective.

517
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:04,564
I want you to find her murderer,
and <i>I</i> want protection.

518
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,567
I know you think this is a bullshit case.
I don’t care.

519
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:10,570
You’re paid to do a job.
Do your fucking job.

520
00:36:10,636 --> 00:36:14,040
- Have you got the pride for that?
- Don’t get in my face, man.

521
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:17,310
Have you got the pride to do
the job you were given?

522
00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:19,312
Do your job, or else.

523
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:22,648
Don’t tell me “or else.” Don’t tell me “or else.”
I’m gonna do the job.

524
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:26,186
I’m not scared of your money, I’m not scared of you,
and I don’t need your threats.

525
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:29,756
- I’m here to do the job!
- Excuse me.

526
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:33,059
Excuse me.
There was a disturbance.

527
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:35,295
It’s nothing.
It’s nothing to be alarmed at.

528
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:49,275
- My partner?
- Got to him. He says don’t move.

529
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:52,278
He’s getting back to you this number,
10, 15 minutes.

530
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:53,780
Okay, thanks.

531
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:57,784
<i>- Oh, sweetie, I’m so sorry about your grandma.</i>
- Thank you so much for coming.

532
00:36:57,851 --> 00:36:59,786
<i>- Mama, I have to talk to you.</i>
<i>- Yes, darling.</i>

533
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:01,621
<i>Dear, go ahead.</i>

534
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,181
Where is the photograph?

535
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:59,079
What’s he saying?
Do you speak Hebrew?

536
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:01,314
It’s not Hebrew.

537
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,449
He’s speaking Yiddish.

538
00:38:03,516 --> 00:38:06,452
He’s –

539
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:10,290
He says the years they spent
working together...

540
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:12,959
his time with her and with –

541
00:38:13,026 --> 00:38:15,228
and with her husband...

542
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:19,299
were the closest ties he ever had
with any living being.

543
00:38:22,235 --> 00:38:24,337
<i>He calls her a great woman.</i>

544
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:27,774
<i>He’s praising her courage...</i>

545
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:31,311
<i>in the years before the formation</i>
<i>of the state of Israel...</i>

546
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:35,615
and he’s talking about when they –

547
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,923
When they what?

548
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:45,558
It’s –

549
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:50,330
You know, it’s jargon language Yiddish.
I-I-I don’t speak Yiddish that well.

550
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,742
Detective, you’re wanted
on the phone in the study.

551
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:11,384
- Thanks.
- You need anything else?

552
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:14,387
No, no, just, uh, hang tight.
And shut the door, will ya?

553
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:19,860
Detective Gold.

554
00:39:19,926 --> 00:39:23,730
Tim! She – The old lady.
She gonna give him up?

555
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:27,834
She gonna give him up? You got her?
You worked her around. Fantastic!

556
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:30,837
Oh, fuck me!
Why do I always miss it?

557
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:32,739
She said what?

558
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:35,441
Oh, yeah, I’m the linchpin.
Big deal.

559
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:38,411
Oh, man. Was it sweet?

560
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:41,614
I would have been there.
I’m stuck here with my – my Jews.

561
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:44,284
You should see this fuckin’ room.

562
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,086
No, fuckin’ bullshit.

563
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:50,691
Bunch of high-strung fuckin’ bullshit.
They pay so much taxes – Fuck ’em.

564
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:54,627
Yo! She did?

565
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:56,963
Fan-fuckin’-tastic!

566
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:01,534
What? Oh, some bullshit.
Somebody’s taking shots at ’em.

567
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:03,536
Hey, fuck ’em.
Don’t tell me.

568
00:40:03,603 --> 00:40:07,373
Don’t send the old lady work down there
and tell me how you’re so surprised.

569
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,943
Fuck ’em and the taxes they pay.

570
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,114
You tell me. Ten more bucks a week they’re makin’,
lettin’ her work down there?

571
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,617
Ha! Hey, not my people, baby.
Fuck ’em.

572
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:20,620
There’s so much anti-Semitism
the last 4,000 years...

573
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:23,256
<i>we must be doin’ somethin’</i>
<i>bring it about.</i>

574
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:25,525
I’ll see you at the house half an hour.

575
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:27,928
Yo, Tim. See you then.

576
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:46,379
My grandmother was killed today.

577
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:49,382
She stayed down there
because she wanted to stay there.

578
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:52,618
She was a fighter.
She wanted to die there.

579
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,722
She died there.

580
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:03,129
You’re a Jew, and you talk that way
in the house of the dead.

581
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:06,700
- Do you have any shame?
- I’m sorry about your grandmother.

582
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,702
No one asked you to be sorry.

583
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:11,204
No one asked for your sympathy.

584
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:13,874
We would have appreciated your respect.

585
00:41:18,278 --> 00:41:20,714
Do you hate yourself that much?

586
00:41:22,182 --> 00:41:24,484
Do you belong nowhere?

587
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:32,358
I – I’ll find the killer. I –

588
00:41:32,425 --> 00:41:35,361
I swear I’ll find the killer.

589
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:37,530
<i>I swear. Listen to me.</i>
<i>Please! I’ll –</i>

590
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:53,847
It was a backfire.

591
00:41:57,751 --> 00:42:00,020
What do you think?

592
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:04,224
I think it was a car backfiring.

593
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:08,428
How do I get to their roof?

594
00:42:08,494 --> 00:42:11,297
Through the kitchen.
You want backup?

595
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,667
No. Keep ’em out of here.

596
00:42:56,509 --> 00:42:58,578
Hey!

597
00:42:58,644 --> 00:42:59,980
Hey!

598
00:45:33,633 --> 00:45:36,236
No, I, uh, think everything
is all right now.

599
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:38,238
We’ve got men all over.
Everything is fine.

600
00:45:38,304 --> 00:45:40,240
There was someone on the roof.

601
00:45:40,306 --> 00:45:42,308
- It’s all my fault.
- This is terrible.

602
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,324
<i>Excuse me.</i>

603
00:45:58,391 --> 00:46:01,795
Can you think of anyone
who would want to harm them?

604
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:05,265
- Did they have any enemies?
- No.

605
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:10,704
They have a lot of money.
What was the old lady doing working down there?

606
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:14,440
- I don’t want to talk about the family.
- Just tell me that.

607
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:18,845
Sh – She... made the money down there,
put the kids through school.

608
00:46:18,912 --> 00:46:21,114
She wanted to stay there.

609
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:23,216
She used to work in Palestine?

610
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:24,951
That’s right.

611
00:46:26,052 --> 00:46:28,054
Excuse me.

612
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:30,984
- Detective?
- Yeah. How are ya?

613
00:47:31,051 --> 00:47:33,119
Fine, thanks.

614
00:47:33,186 --> 00:47:36,256
Always coldest just before the dawn.

615
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:38,358
Yes, I remember that.

616
00:47:42,595 --> 00:47:44,597
<i>You going in?</i>

617
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:48,601
Yeah.

618
00:48:00,613 --> 00:48:02,615
Where are the lights?

619
00:48:11,157 --> 00:48:13,994
<i>Some valuable stuff down in the cellar?</i>

620
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,730
<i>Hey, that’s just something they said.</i>

621
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:21,902
<i>Something the kids been sayin’</i>
<i>around here for years.</i>

622
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:24,404
<i>See for yourself.</i>
<i>Nothin’ down there.</i>

623
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:26,406
- Hmm.
- <i>Dust on the stairs.</i>

624
00:48:26,472 --> 00:48:29,910
- <i>Ain’t nobody been down there in years.</i>
- Uh-huh.

625
00:48:29,976 --> 00:48:33,013
<i>They say she kept a piece</i>
<i>behind the counter.</i>

626
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:38,018
<i>But what is that gonna do,</i>
<i>some guy comes in with a shotgun?</i>

627
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:41,021
<i>And how are you gonna be</i>
<i>watchin’ the door all day?</i>

628
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:43,023
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Every day, huh?</i>

629
00:48:43,089 --> 00:48:45,826
<i>You can’t do it.</i>

630
00:48:45,892 --> 00:48:50,396
<i>So I say I’m gonna be in here someday,</i>
<i>she gets popped.</i>

631
00:48:50,463 --> 00:48:54,868
<i>And it was just a question of when,</i>
<i>no more, no less.</i>

632
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:57,470
<i>Tell you somethin’ else.</i>

633
00:48:57,537 --> 00:49:00,473
<i>I don’t know that her coming here</i>
<i>does not</i> make <i>violence.</i>

634
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:04,277
<i>Rich Jew lady in this neighborhood</i>
<i>is gon’ get took off.</i>

635
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:06,279
<i>Human nature.</i>

636
00:49:06,346 --> 00:49:10,550
<i>Someday somebody gonna</i>
<i>come in here, see what it is.</i>

637
00:49:11,551 --> 00:49:13,486
<i>You okay down there?</i>

638
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:15,221
Yeah, I’m fine.

639
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:03,203
You all right down there, Detective?

640
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:04,938
Mm-hmm.

641
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:14,681
“Hauser. Greenblatts. Samson.

642
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:18,384
Greenwald. Klein. Gross.”

643
00:50:37,437 --> 00:50:39,372
<i>Good morning.</i>

644
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:42,042
Get this to the A.T.F., will you?

645
00:50:42,108 --> 00:50:44,210
Good morning.
And make me copies.

646
00:50:44,277 --> 00:50:48,381
An invoice –
20 Thompson machine guns from 1946...

647
00:50:48,448 --> 00:50:50,383
and a list of names.

648
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,354
And please, run this
through the computer –

649
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,290
“Grofaz.”

650
00:50:57,357 --> 00:51:00,661
- Grofaz?
- G-R-O-F-A-Z.

651
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:02,663
What is it, a name?

652
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:05,531
- I don’t know what it is.
- All right.

653
00:51:05,598 --> 00:51:07,600
Have a good day.

654
00:51:10,503 --> 00:51:13,273
Get up, Mr. Wells.
I’m taking you in for arraignment.

655
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:15,075
- Detective.
- Yeah.

656
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:17,811
- I need you to file a complaint on this man.
- Complaint?

657
00:51:17,878 --> 00:51:20,146
- He assaulted you.
- Forget it.

658
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:22,248
Assault police officer,
attempted escape.

659
00:51:22,315 --> 00:51:24,550
Yeah, forget it.
Fuckin’ guy shot his wife and kids.

660
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:26,787
What are they gonna do to him
for beating on me?

661
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:30,056
Sir, the thing is you need to make an example
of this guy hittin’ on a cop.

662
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:32,726
Hey, leave it, all right?

663
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:34,728
I won’t forget this, Officer.
Thank you.

664
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,664
I’ll make it up to you. I promise.

665
00:51:37,731 --> 00:51:40,934
- You’re gonna make it up to me?
- Yes, I will.

666
00:51:41,935 --> 00:51:44,137
<i>Your kindness has changed my life.</i>

667
00:51:44,204 --> 00:51:46,673
Well, that’s swell.

668
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,175
And someday, I’ll repay you.

669
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:52,378
Uh-huh.

670
00:51:52,445 --> 00:51:55,648
My thoughts are elsewhere.
You must pardon me.

671
00:51:59,886 --> 00:52:05,158
Yeah. Grofaz. G-R-O-F-A-Z.

672
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:07,160
- Hi.
- How you doing, Billy?

673
00:52:07,227 --> 00:52:09,763
Okay. You all alone here today?

674
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,798
Yeah, I’m never going home.
Here. Keep it.

675
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:15,101
- Thanks.
- Anything you might have.

676
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:19,639
Particularly anything connected
with anti-Jewish acts.

677
00:52:19,706 --> 00:52:21,908
Well, if you do,
will you please call me here?

678
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:24,010
Thank you.

679
00:52:24,077 --> 00:52:26,379
That’s him. That’s the man.

680
00:52:26,446 --> 00:52:28,314
- <i>What’s happening, Brown?</i>
<i>- That’s him. You’re the one.</i>

681
00:52:28,381 --> 00:52:30,416
I’m gonna do it,
but I’m gonna do it with you.

682
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:32,886
<i>You’re gonna take him in like you told me,</i>
<i>nice and gentle.</i>

683
00:52:32,953 --> 00:52:35,521
- No harm will come to him.
- No harm will come to him.

684
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:38,324
- You swore that.
- <i>Well, you won her around, my man.</i>

685
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:41,895
- I did?
- You said the magic word. The duck came down.

686
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:44,931
5:00 a.m., Randolph meets his mother.

687
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:49,035
Here’s the setup: She’s gonna tell him she’s gonna
get him out of the country, get him a ticket.

688
00:52:49,102 --> 00:52:51,705
- Jilly, you want to come in here?
- Hold it a minute, Frank.

689
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:55,441
We have her tell Randolph she’s gonna
get the passport of a friend of his.

690
00:52:55,508 --> 00:52:59,012
So Randolph thinks he’s gonna take
the passport, go to South America.

691
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:02,849
- We have his mom set up a date with him.
- Jilly, I gotta work on this thing here.

692
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:06,086
No, Bob.
The broad won’t show unless you’re there.

693
00:53:06,152 --> 00:53:08,021
You’re the man gonna bring him in.

694
00:53:08,088 --> 00:53:10,456
- <i>5:00 a.m. tomorrow.</i>
- I gotta work on this thing.

695
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:12,258
- Put it on the shelf.
- I can’t.

696
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:15,328
You’ve got to.
We’re taking Randolph 5:00 a.m. tomorrow.

697
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:18,331
You’re gonna be there.
Get over to passport office right now.

698
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:21,034
<i>Sully’s waiting for ’em.</i>
<i>Give ’em those pictures.</i>

699
00:53:21,101 --> 00:53:23,536
- Hey, this is the big one, Bob.
<i>- Jilly!</i>

700
00:53:23,603 --> 00:53:27,307
Comin’, Frank.
Get over to passport office right now.

701
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:33,179
<i>This rendezvous with Randolph</i>
<i>takes place at 5:00 a.m....</i>

702
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:36,783
at, uh – at Third and, uh –

703
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:39,953
Bob?

704
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,889
- I was out all night on this.
- Uh-huh.

705
00:53:42,956 --> 00:53:47,260
What do you make of it?
I got a picture of this woman, taken in Wisconsin.

706
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:50,797
Nice old Jewish woman with a tommy gun.
All right?

707
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:55,501
What is she doing with an invoice
for these tommy guns in the basement?

708
00:53:56,502 --> 00:54:00,006
I got, um – Last night.

709
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:02,342
I got Israeli heavy hitters coming in.

710
00:54:02,408 --> 00:54:04,344
I got some guy on the roof.

711
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:07,080
- Yeah, well, it’s a mystery, isn’t it?
- Look.

712
00:54:07,147 --> 00:54:09,783
- This was taken in Wisconsin, 1946.
- Bob.

713
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:13,119
Bob. Hey, Bob. Hey.
Get out of it.

714
00:54:13,186 --> 00:54:16,857
We got a job to do.
Tonight the balloon goes up.

715
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:19,192
The old days, Bobby, huh?
You bust a case...

716
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:22,495
bottle comes out, stick your feet up
on the filing cabinet, eh?

717
00:54:22,562 --> 00:54:24,931
We lure Randolph out, we take him in.

718
00:54:24,998 --> 00:54:26,933
Third and Racine. You got it?

719
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,535
- This other case –
- Fuck the other case.

720
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:32,105
What other case?
What other case?

721
00:54:32,172 --> 00:54:36,710
- This Jewish –
- It’s a candy store pop. Just look busy on it.

722
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:40,681
I – Well, you know, I caught the case.

723
00:54:40,747 --> 00:54:43,649
What i –
What is there, a broad in it?

724
00:54:43,717 --> 00:54:47,220
Hmm? What’s the thing?

725
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:51,792
It’s just – I think it’s some –
some sort of conspiracy.

726
00:54:51,858 --> 00:54:55,461
- Some sort of conspiracy.
- They said somebody was shooting at them.

727
00:54:55,528 --> 00:54:57,463
Someone was shooting at them.
The Jew family?

728
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:00,901
- Yes.
- Was there someone shooting at them?

729
00:55:02,002 --> 00:55:04,104
Hmm? Bob?

730
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,239
Hmm?

731
00:55:07,473 --> 00:55:09,142
Hey.

732
00:55:09,209 --> 00:55:12,946
You got some – You got some
heavy troubles on your mind?

733
00:55:13,013 --> 00:55:15,448
Huh? Babe? We’ll work it out.

734
00:55:15,515 --> 00:55:19,119
We’ll play some cops and robbers.
We’ll bust this big criminal.

735
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:21,487
We’ll swagger around.

736
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:28,628
- You’re like my family, Tim.
- Bob, I am your family.

737
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:31,364
<i>Here you go.</i>

738
00:55:31,431 --> 00:55:33,700
One passport show-and-tell.

739
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:37,503
<i>I’ll require your signature on these documents.</i>
<i>These also require your star number.</i>

740
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:41,942
May I see it, please? Please fill in
only those sections marked as required.

741
00:55:42,008 --> 00:55:44,510
This is a release form.
Please read it.

742
00:55:44,577 --> 00:55:46,947
All these documents remain the property
of the passport office...

743
00:55:47,013 --> 00:55:49,783
<i>and are loaned to you only for the purposes</i>
<i>as set forward in your application.</i>

744
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:52,018
- Third and Racine.
- Your acceptance of them constitutes...

745
00:55:52,085 --> 00:55:54,988
- <i>release of responsibility for this office –</i>
- 5:00 a.m.

746
00:55:55,055 --> 00:55:57,357
- Third and Racine.
- until they are returned to our physical custody.

747
00:55:57,423 --> 00:56:00,761
Misuse or malfeasance in regard
to this document is a federal crime.

748
00:56:00,827 --> 00:56:04,464
- I’m sorry. You can’t smoke in here. Now –
- I’ll see you in the hall.

749
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,099
<i>We have the G22 A –</i>

750
00:56:29,189 --> 00:56:31,457
- Yeah, I’ll file the form
and see you tomorrow morning.
- <i>Okay.</i>

751
00:56:31,524 --> 00:56:34,360
- Thanks a lot, Al.
- Sure thing.
You going up to the country this weekend?

752
00:56:34,427 --> 00:56:36,429
No, we’re staying in town.
I’ll see you later.

753
00:56:37,664 --> 00:56:39,933
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>
<i>Write away to the manufacturer?</i>

754
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,935
- I rebel –
- Jerry.

755
00:56:42,002 --> 00:56:44,404
Wait a second.
I rebel every time somebody says to me –

756
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,506
- Excuse me.
<i>- “This is the thing of the future.”</i>

757
00:56:46,572 --> 00:56:48,541
<i>If something works, why –</i>

758
00:56:48,608 --> 00:56:50,576
I just saw the A.T.F.
They were stolen, Sully.

759
00:56:50,643 --> 00:56:52,913
The tommy guns were stolen.
All the guns on this invoice.

760
00:56:52,979 --> 00:56:54,915
Hey. You’re better than an aquarium,
you know that?

761
00:56:54,981 --> 00:56:57,317
- There’s something happening
with you every minute.
- What does it mean?

762
00:56:57,383 --> 00:57:00,654
It don’t mean nothing. Some broad got killed.
She’s dead now. Okay?

763
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:03,156
You’re going to the ticket office,
pick up Randolph’s tickets.

764
00:57:03,223 --> 00:57:05,325
- This is the big one, laddie.
- Timmy, this other case.

765
00:57:05,391 --> 00:57:07,928
- Bob.
- I got this piece of paper I found. “Grofaz.”

766
00:57:07,994 --> 00:57:09,930
“Grofaz.” What does it mean?

767
00:57:09,996 --> 00:57:13,399
I don’t know what it means.
I got this fella on the roof – the Jewish house. I –

768
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:15,535
- What was he doing? Shooting at ’em?
- I don’t know.

769
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:17,871
Well, then drop it, Bobby.
For Christ’s sake.

770
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:19,940
I don’t get it.

771
00:57:21,141 --> 00:57:23,844
- Maybe you don’t want to get it.
- What do you mean?

772
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:26,312
- Nothin’.
- What do you mean? ’Cause I ain’t a Yid?

773
00:57:26,379 --> 00:57:28,614
- Well, you ain’t a Yid.
- And so what?

774
00:57:28,682 --> 00:57:31,117
I’m – I’m an anti-Semite?
What the fuck are you sayin’?

775
00:57:31,184 --> 00:57:34,988
It’s just not your thing, Tim.
It’s not your thing. It’s <i>my</i> thing, okay?

776
00:57:35,055 --> 00:57:39,893
Bob, I’m gonna tell you what the old whore said,
and this is the truest thing I know.

777
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,429
“When you start comin’ with the customers,
it’s time to quit.”

778
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:47,533
- What is this?
- That’s the strap the guy tore off my holster.

779
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,538
Well, go get it fixed, will ya?
Go take a cooling walk – somethin’.

780
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:55,341
- You mad at me?
- Yeah, I’m mad at you.

781
00:57:55,408 --> 00:57:57,510
I’m not gonna invite you to my birthday party.

782
00:57:57,577 --> 00:57:59,512
You dumb kike.

783
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:01,581
Go get your holster fixed.

784
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:14,627
- Excuse me.
- We’re closed.

785
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:17,731
Well, I, uh, wonder, could you help me?

786
00:58:18,932 --> 00:58:23,069
- We’re closed. We’re closing up.
- Well, I just need, um – I got a little problem.

787
00:58:23,136 --> 00:58:27,607
I’m a police officer.
I lost the strap off my holster.

788
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:31,945
<i>I can’t help it. We’re closing up. I’m sorry.</i>

789
00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:36,049
You’re a policeman?

790
00:58:36,116 --> 00:58:37,583
Yes.

791
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,087
Show it to me.

792
00:58:52,766 --> 00:58:55,035
- What is it?
- A word.

793
00:58:55,101 --> 00:58:58,638
A word?
You know what the word means?

794
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:04,845
Yes. I know what it means.

795
00:59:08,448 --> 00:59:10,383
It means “Hitler.”

796
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:14,655
It was another name they had for Hitler.

797
00:59:23,897 --> 00:59:29,302
<i>“Größter Feldherr Aller Zeiten.”</i>

798
00:59:30,636 --> 00:59:34,507
“The greatest strategist...

799
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:36,576
of all time.”

800
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:40,413
The Grofaz.

801
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:43,316
Hitler.

802
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:55,962
- Are you all right?
- What?

803
00:59:56,029 --> 00:59:59,299
No, I, uh, just didn’t get much sleep last night.

804
01:00:01,735 --> 01:00:04,170
You know,
you have a very interesting request.

805
01:00:07,207 --> 01:00:09,910
The acronym is not well-known.

806
01:00:09,976 --> 01:00:12,045
It was used at the end of the war.

807
01:00:12,112 --> 01:00:16,349
The name is obviously the effort
of their Propaganda Ministry.

808
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:20,586
It was an interesting attempt,
but it didn’t particularly take.

809
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:23,556
It was used by a group –

810
01:00:24,858 --> 01:00:27,794
the Sonderkommando.

811
01:00:27,861 --> 01:00:32,432
It was adopted by
the Sonder Endlösung Kommando...

812
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:35,869
of the division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler.

813
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:38,238
That is, the special group
for the final solution...

814
01:00:38,304 --> 01:00:42,308
which is, of course,
the extermination of the Jews.

815
01:00:42,375 --> 01:00:44,745
“German people, follow the Grofaz.”

816
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:48,548
“The Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler
fights on all fronts for the salvation of Germany.

817
01:00:48,614 --> 01:00:50,917
The Jewish scourge
can be cleansed only in blood.”

818
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:52,919
Uh, this is a very rare piece.

819
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:55,922
What do you have on the use of this word?
Currently.

820
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:59,192
Particularly in conjunction with
anti-Semitic acts.

821
01:00:59,259 --> 01:01:03,096
As I said, it’s an arcane usage, but we’ll look.

822
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:05,165
We’ll take a look.

823
01:01:05,231 --> 01:01:07,433
Ann?

824
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,571
Current anti-Semitism under “Grofaz,”
cross-reference “Der Führer.” Bring it all.

825
01:01:11,637 --> 01:01:13,639
Yes.

826
01:01:15,241 --> 01:01:17,243
If you’d care to wait.

827
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,106
I’m a police officer.

828
01:01:52,145 --> 01:01:54,114
The revolver disturbs you.

829
01:01:55,115 --> 01:01:57,383
The gun disturbs you. I’m a police officer.

830
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,820
The gun doesn’t disturb me.

831
01:01:59,886 --> 01:02:03,423
- You were looking at me.
- The gun is nothing. The gun is a tool.

832
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:07,127
We have nothing to fear from a tool.
The badge concerns me.

833
01:02:07,193 --> 01:02:10,396
The badge, you see –
The badge is a symbol.

834
01:02:10,463 --> 01:02:15,635
The badge is the symbol
of that which constrains us.

835
01:02:15,702 --> 01:02:20,106
The star, you see – The star.
The five-pointed star.

836
01:02:20,173 --> 01:02:22,308
The pentagram.

837
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:24,577
It is identified as a star...

838
01:02:24,644 --> 01:02:26,579
but it is not the symbol of heaven.

839
01:02:26,646 --> 01:02:28,581
It is the symbol of Earth.

840
01:02:28,648 --> 01:02:33,720
The Magen David is the intersection
of the opposites...

841
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:37,824
and can be deconstructed
into heaven and Earth.

842
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:40,493
But the pentagram cannot be deconstructed.

843
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,962
You see?

844
01:02:42,028 --> 01:02:44,798
The five points are the five senses.

845
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:49,002
<i>The Chinese five elements.</i>
<i>The five fingers of the hand.</i>

846
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:51,004
You see?

847
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:52,839
You’re Jewish?

848
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:55,909
<i>Are you Jewish?</i>

849
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,980
- Yes.
- Well –

850
01:03:00,046 --> 01:03:02,015
You see?

851
01:03:02,082 --> 01:03:04,550
From the book of Esther.

852
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:08,321
<i>Esther. From</i> “satar” <i>– “to conceal.”</i>

853
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:10,623
But what is concealed?

854
01:03:10,691 --> 01:03:14,060
What is concealed in the name Esther?

855
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,196
And the answer is here.

856
01:03:16,262 --> 01:03:18,932
Here is the answer. Do you see?

857
01:03:20,266 --> 01:03:22,135
I can’t read it.

858
01:03:22,202 --> 01:03:25,071
You say you’re a Jew.

859
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:26,572
I can’t read it.

860
01:03:30,877 --> 01:03:34,948
You say you’re a Jew,
and you can’t read Hebrew.

861
01:03:39,485 --> 01:03:41,421
What are you then?

862
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,362
Would you get that book for me?

863
01:03:56,837 --> 01:03:59,605
Would you replace it for me, please?

864
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:01,942
It goes up there.

865
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:13,186
The material on anti-Semitic acts –

866
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:15,621
Yes. I thought we had quite a file of current –

867
01:04:15,689 --> 01:04:18,224
It was requested by 212.

868
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:20,961
- 212 wants it?
- Yes.

869
01:04:21,027 --> 01:04:24,297
<i>Loaned to 212 now?</i>
<i>Fine. Then just pull the file.</i>

870
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:27,467
Okay. Thanks.

871
01:04:36,642 --> 01:04:39,012
The material on anti-Semitic acts.

872
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:41,047
- No, we have nothing on that.
- Nothing?

873
01:04:41,114 --> 01:04:43,583
- No.
- This is official police business.

874
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:48,421
Officer, you know I’d help you i-if I could,
but as I said, it was rather arcane material.

875
01:04:48,488 --> 01:04:50,090
I’m sorry.

876
01:04:50,156 --> 01:04:53,626
Well, if there’s nothing you can do,
there’s nothing you can do. Thank you.

877
01:04:53,694 --> 01:04:57,163
Not at all. If there’s anything else
I can help you with, let me know.

878
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:11,738
<i>We could put the couch on the other side.</i>

879
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:14,307
Bookshelf would be nice,
but I thought it would be –

880
01:06:18,078 --> 01:06:20,013
I, um –

881
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,916
Can you tell me anything about this building?

882
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:26,386
- What?
- Do you know anything about this building?

883
01:06:26,452 --> 01:06:28,388
- <i>I just, um –</i>
- About this building?

884
01:06:28,454 --> 01:06:30,691
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Do you live around here?

885
01:06:30,757 --> 01:06:33,559
- Please, just tell me.
- Have you ever seen anyone go in or out –

886
01:06:33,626 --> 01:06:36,262
Get up against the fence.
Up against the fence and grab it.

887
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:38,264
Get up against the fence.

888
01:06:38,331 --> 01:06:41,668
<i>Now grab the fence,</i>
<i>or I will shoot you dead.</i>

889
01:06:48,842 --> 01:06:50,844
What brings you out this evening, Mr. Gold?

890
01:06:51,912 --> 01:06:53,880
I want to know about the old woman.

891
01:06:53,947 --> 01:06:56,683
- We know nothing.
- I think she was involved in running guns.

892
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,685
- Running guns?
- Long ago.

893
01:06:58,752 --> 01:07:01,521
- Why is that?
- I-I found a list.

894
01:07:01,587 --> 01:07:04,725
A list of Jewish names.
Men, here in this city.

895
01:07:04,791 --> 01:07:06,760
I think they were running guns with her. I –

896
01:07:06,827 --> 01:07:09,996
How did you get this address?
What are you doing here?

897
01:07:10,997 --> 01:07:12,933
Why are you here?

898
01:07:15,902 --> 01:07:17,904
I need help.

899
01:07:17,971 --> 01:07:20,406
I want to know why she was killed.

900
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,883
All right.

901
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:53,006
<i>This way, Mr. Gold.</i>

902
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:23,303
Please. Sit down.

903
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:28,041
See that gun?
I had one just like it.

904
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:32,679
<i>I gave mine to a kid in Hebron.</i>
<i>Last year. Two years ago.</i>

905
01:08:32,746 --> 01:08:35,816
They told me it was an affectation
for me to still wear it.

906
01:08:35,882 --> 01:08:37,884
But you get used to it, you know.

907
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:40,253
- Eh, Koli?
- That’s right.

908
01:08:41,454 --> 01:08:44,524
Ah. Would you like
something to eat, Mr. Gold?

909
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,927
I’m going to have something to eat.

910
01:08:46,993 --> 01:08:48,929
Barry, you want something?

911
01:08:48,995 --> 01:08:51,131
- Sure. Love to.
- Shot the old lady.

912
01:08:51,197 --> 01:08:53,800
- I know.
- Barry was with us in the old days.

913
01:08:53,867 --> 01:08:56,770
- That’s right.
- And Lev and Marv.

914
01:08:58,371 --> 01:09:00,573
What a time that was, Mr. Gold.

915
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,642
<i>What a woman she was.</i>

916
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:05,511
- I want to find the men who killed her.
- <i>Yes.</i>

917
01:09:05,578 --> 01:09:07,848
And we need your help.

918
01:09:07,914 --> 01:09:09,983
- You have it.
- Yes.

919
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:13,787
She was running guns, wasn’t she?

920
01:09:13,854 --> 01:09:17,791
Yes. During our war of independence.

921
01:09:17,858 --> 01:09:20,661
In our country, we call her a hero.

922
01:09:20,727 --> 01:09:23,129
Why would anyone want to kill her now?

923
01:09:23,196 --> 01:09:26,432
I don’t know, but we must find out.

924
01:09:26,499 --> 01:09:28,501
So many of us...

925
01:09:28,568 --> 01:09:32,172
good Americans,
who are good Jews...

926
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:34,908
and good friends to Israel.

927
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:38,544
- We always need such friends, you know.
- Isn’t that the truth?

928
01:09:38,611 --> 01:09:40,747
Yes.

929
01:09:40,814 --> 01:09:43,283
You, uh – You’re such a man.

930
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:47,153
- I?
- <i>You’d like to fight for your home.</i>

931
01:09:48,822 --> 01:09:50,757
I would do anything.

932
01:09:54,327 --> 01:09:56,329
Now...

933
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:00,033
we’re going to find the killers.

934
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:03,636
We’re going to find them,
and we’re going to deal with them.

935
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:07,540
You mentioned something about a list.
Now, we need the list.

936
01:10:15,381 --> 01:10:17,984
No. No, no. The original.

937
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:21,755
- It’s at the precinct house.
- Oh, good. Bring it with you when next you come.

938
01:10:21,822 --> 01:10:23,957
- Asher will fill you in –
- I-I can’t –

939
01:10:24,024 --> 01:10:27,127
Look. Excuse me.
I can’t bring the original.

940
01:10:27,193 --> 01:10:31,564
- No. The original is what we need.
<i>- That’s what we need.</i>

941
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:34,901
You see, it must be destroyed.

942
01:10:34,968 --> 01:10:39,572
She was killed. This man –
These men – Good men in a city.

943
01:10:39,639 --> 01:10:42,408
You see, they’re in danger.

944
01:10:42,475 --> 01:10:44,510
- But –
- Yes?

945
01:10:46,446 --> 01:10:48,581
The list is evidence.

946
01:10:48,648 --> 01:10:50,951
I-I’ve logged it into an evidence bag.

947
01:10:51,017 --> 01:10:52,686
I – I’ve signed it in.

948
01:10:52,753 --> 01:10:55,188
Pl – Please.

949
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:57,190
I – You know, anything.

950
01:10:57,257 --> 01:11:00,360
No. Not anything. I need the list.

951
01:11:00,426 --> 01:11:04,097
- Anything else.
- Yes. Yes. Anything else.

952
01:11:04,164 --> 01:11:06,632
Of course. Anything else.

953
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:20,080
<i>Zahav.</i>

954
01:11:20,146 --> 01:11:23,349
That’s your name in Hebrew.
Are you a Jew, Mr. Gold?

955
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:26,052
- Yes.
- Then be a Jew.

956
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:28,054
<i>You can’t get the list.</i>

957
01:11:28,121 --> 01:11:31,191
<i>How long your resolution last?</i>
<i>Until the first unpleasantness.</i>

958
01:11:31,257 --> 01:11:34,627
- I’m a sworn police officer.
- <i>Where are your loyalties?</i>

959
01:11:34,695 --> 01:11:37,497
You want a home. You want glory.

960
01:11:37,563 --> 01:11:39,565
<i>You’re willing to do nothing.</i>

961
01:11:39,632 --> 01:11:42,202
- I took an oath.
- Took an oath.

962
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,642
He disgusts me.

963
01:11:50,677 --> 01:11:52,645
Get him out of here.

964
01:12:05,591 --> 01:12:09,062
Don’t bother to return. The next time you come,
there’ll be nobody here.

965
01:13:00,914 --> 01:13:02,415
Yes?

966
01:13:02,482 --> 01:13:05,752
I need –
I need to help.

967
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:09,255
- In what way?
- I want to help you, in your work.

968
01:13:09,322 --> 01:13:11,324
- I work for the airlines.
- Please.

969
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:14,728
Please, let me help –
with whatever you do.

970
01:13:14,795 --> 01:13:17,998
What I do, Mr. Gold, you don’t want to know.

971
01:13:18,064 --> 01:13:20,300
No, but I do. I need to –

972
01:13:20,366 --> 01:13:22,602
Please. Whatever you’re doing –

973
01:13:22,669 --> 01:13:25,438
what you’re doing tonight –
let me help.

974
01:13:25,505 --> 01:13:28,675
Please. I’m begging you.

975
01:13:31,011 --> 01:13:33,013
Please.

976
01:13:40,386 --> 01:13:42,923
What can I tell ya about it?

977
01:13:42,989 --> 01:13:45,125
They said I was a pussy all my life.

978
01:13:46,693 --> 01:13:51,064
They said I was a pussy because I was a Jew.

979
01:13:52,165 --> 01:13:55,101
And the cops –
They’d say, “Send a Jew?

980
01:13:55,168 --> 01:13:58,171
Might as well send a broad on a job.”

981
01:14:00,741 --> 01:14:03,376
“Send a broad through the door.”

982
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:07,380
That’s what they said.

983
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:09,816
All my goddamn life.

984
01:14:09,883 --> 01:14:13,286
And I listened to it. Huh?

985
01:14:15,321 --> 01:14:19,025
I was the donkey.
I was the clown.

986
01:14:19,092 --> 01:14:21,627
- You were the outsider.
- Yes.

987
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:25,899
- I understand.
- They made me the hostage negotiator...

988
01:14:29,302 --> 01:14:32,973
’cause I knew how the bad guys felt.

989
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:35,275
Doing other people’s work for them.

990
01:14:35,341 --> 01:14:37,978
- That’s right.
- In their country.

991
01:14:38,044 --> 01:14:41,247
- Yes, that’s right.
- And never working for yourself.

992
01:14:41,314 --> 01:14:43,917
- Yes.
- I know.

993
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:48,621
Now, why would I do that?

994
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:58,865
You have your own home.

995
01:14:58,932 --> 01:15:02,202
Yes. I do.

996
01:15:02,268 --> 01:15:05,138
Now, what can that be like?

997
01:15:07,407 --> 01:15:10,343
To have your own country.

998
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:13,013
I’m gone so much of the time.

999
01:15:16,482 --> 01:15:18,418
But I think about it.

1000
01:15:23,757 --> 01:15:25,759
I know.

1001
01:15:26,927 --> 01:15:29,495
I sat with those guys tonight.

1002
01:15:29,562 --> 01:15:33,099
With... heroes.

1003
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:35,869
Jewish guys who had nothing to prove.

1004
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:39,139
And I –

1005
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:42,542
And I felt, Jesus, all my life...

1006
01:15:42,608 --> 01:15:45,311
I gotta be the first one in the door.

1007
01:15:45,378 --> 01:15:47,380
Huh?

1008
01:15:48,849 --> 01:15:50,784
Not for me.

1009
01:15:50,851 --> 01:15:52,819
All for someone else.

1010
01:15:52,886 --> 01:15:54,821
Why?

1011
01:15:56,256 --> 01:15:58,191
Because I’m no good.

1012
01:15:59,192 --> 01:16:01,127
Because I’m nobody.

1013
01:16:02,362 --> 01:16:04,430
I want to be a part of it.

1014
01:16:05,799 --> 01:16:07,801
That’s all.

1015
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:19,279
We think this leaflet
was printed at that shop.

1016
01:16:19,345 --> 01:16:23,984
The shop is owned by a Mr. Andersen, who’s
head of a group called the United Action Front...

1017
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:27,187
who we think may have had something
to do with the murder of Mrs. Klein.

1018
01:16:27,253 --> 01:16:29,189
And what were you sent here to do?

1019
01:16:29,255 --> 01:16:31,391
To find out if the leaflet was printed there.

1020
01:16:31,457 --> 01:16:36,196
- And if it was?
- If it was, I’m going to give them a message.

1021
01:16:36,262 --> 01:16:38,364
- I won’t be long.
- Let me do it for you.

1022
01:16:38,431 --> 01:16:40,633
No, I can’t do that.

1023
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:44,270
Wait. Give that back to me.
Give it back.

1024
01:16:45,772 --> 01:16:48,909
- I can’t let you do it.
- I’m going. How do I get in?

1025
01:16:48,975 --> 01:16:52,178
I’m going. If I don’t go, nobody’s going.
How do I get in?

1026
01:16:52,245 --> 01:16:54,247
All right, then.

1027
01:16:56,449 --> 01:16:58,518
- Can you use these lockpicks?
- Yes.

1028
01:16:58,584 --> 01:16:59,886
Can you use that?

1029
01:16:59,953 --> 01:17:02,588
The bottom button, then the top.

1030
01:22:06,192 --> 01:22:08,729
We went to that place.

1031
01:22:08,795 --> 01:22:11,431
- Good.
- I want to be a part of it.

1032
01:22:11,497 --> 01:22:13,834
Good. Then you are a part of it.

1033
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,836
You’ve shown it.

1034
01:22:17,838 --> 01:22:19,840
And now there’s something
we need from you.

1035
01:22:19,906 --> 01:22:23,509
- Yes.
- That list of names.

1036
01:22:23,576 --> 01:22:25,511
We need the list.

1037
01:22:25,578 --> 01:22:27,848
I told you.
As a policeman, I can’t.

1038
01:22:27,914 --> 01:22:31,551
- We need it.
- What he wants – give it to him. Please.

1039
01:22:31,617 --> 01:22:33,586
I’ve explained it to him.

1040
01:22:33,654 --> 01:22:36,356
I can’t. It’s evidence. Wh –

1041
01:22:36,422 --> 01:22:38,859
Why do you want me to prove myself?
Haven’t I done that tonight?

1042
01:22:38,925 --> 01:22:42,062
We don’t want you to prove yourself.
We want the list.

1043
01:22:42,128 --> 01:22:43,496
No, I told you.

1044
01:22:49,369 --> 01:22:52,673
<i>The building you entered</i>
<i>was under surveillance.</i>

1045
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:55,508
<i>Here are some photographs</i>
<i>of you entering and leaving.</i>

1046
01:22:56,509 --> 01:22:58,511
Look at them at your leisure.

1047
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:03,383
<i>We need the list.</i>

1048
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,537
The facts here speak for themselves.
You are nothing. Nothing.

1049
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:06,713
Oh, my God.

1050
01:24:43,216 --> 01:24:46,419
<i>I got a man hit.</i>
<i>I need an ambulance right now!</i>

1051
01:24:46,486 --> 01:24:48,855
- Where were you?
- What happened? What went down?

1052
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:50,590
<i>Whole thing’s gone bad.</i>

1053
01:24:50,657 --> 01:24:53,059
<i>Sully here. Lieu, I can see the guy.</i>

1054
01:24:53,126 --> 01:24:55,996
Sullivan, pull out. Leave him there.
Let the SWAT get him.

1055
01:24:58,231 --> 01:25:01,802
You guys take cover!
Get over close to the road! Take cover!

1056
01:25:01,868 --> 01:25:05,305
<i>Lieu, I got the uniform kid. He’s hit bad.</i>

1057
01:25:05,371 --> 01:25:09,843
Okay. Bring him down. Bring him around.
They got an ambulance coming in.

1058
01:25:10,844 --> 01:25:13,980
Sullivan, Frank –
you two guys get the hell out of there!

1059
01:25:15,716 --> 01:25:18,051
- Sully’s hit, Lieu.
- Oh, God. Where are they?

1060
01:25:18,118 --> 01:25:20,854
- Sully’s hit bad.
- Where is he? Where’s Sullivan?

1061
01:25:22,522 --> 01:25:25,625
- <i>Stuck on the second floor.</i>
- Homicide. I’m on the corner of Fourth –

1062
01:25:25,692 --> 01:25:28,294
- Where’s Sullivan?
- <i>Yes, I see you. Don’t come in.</i>

1063
01:25:28,361 --> 01:25:30,897
Stay out! Stay out!

1064
01:25:30,964 --> 01:25:33,499
Tim, it’s Bobby.
Can you hear me?

1065
01:25:35,235 --> 01:25:37,070
I’m going after Sullivan.

1066
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:47,247
<i>Help! Oh, my God!</i>

1067
01:25:47,313 --> 01:25:49,515
- <i>Someone get me out of here!</i>
- Oh, God!

1068
01:25:49,582 --> 01:25:51,551
- <i>Get me out!</i>
- Charlie, give me some cover.

1069
01:25:51,617 --> 01:25:55,021
- <i>You got it, Lieu.</i>
- You two guys, get your ass over here.

1070
01:25:57,557 --> 01:26:00,593
- I’m hit!
- Bobby, get to cover right now!

1071
01:26:00,661 --> 01:26:03,029
I’m going in after Sullivan!

1072
01:26:03,096 --> 01:26:05,165
<i>All units –</i>

1073
01:26:12,405 --> 01:26:16,176
<i>Hey. Hey, can we get some help here?</i>

1074
01:26:42,068 --> 01:26:45,105
- <i>Yo!</i>
- Where’s the backup? Where is the backup?

1075
01:26:50,777 --> 01:26:53,079
Hey.

1076
01:26:53,146 --> 01:26:55,882
<i>Frankie, just hold up there. Just hold up there.</i>

1077
01:26:55,949 --> 01:26:59,219
- I gotta get some blood here.
- We’re working on it. Can we get some help here?

1078
01:26:59,285 --> 01:27:01,621
<i>Lieu. Lieu. Where’s the ambulance?</i>

1079
01:27:01,688 --> 01:27:04,725
He shot the gun dry.
I said, “Now, don’t be doing that.

1080
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:06,727
You move around –

1081
01:27:06,793 --> 01:27:08,895
- Bobby.
- Hold on, Tim.

1082
01:27:10,964 --> 01:27:13,934
You see, Bobby?
Although, somebody told him to do that.

1083
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,936
- Now, who would do that, Bob?
- Where’s the medic?

1084
01:27:16,002 --> 01:27:17,938
- Frankie, what does the lieu say?
- Oh, God.

1085
01:27:18,004 --> 01:27:20,440
- Hold on, Tim.
- Can we get some help up here, Lieu?

1086
01:27:20,506 --> 01:27:22,542
- You know what I’m talking about?
- Yeah, yeah. That’s right.

1087
01:27:22,608 --> 01:27:24,845
- Frankie, what does the lieu say?
- Do you know what I’m talking about?

1088
01:27:24,911 --> 01:27:27,480
- Yes, I do.
- But, finally...

1089
01:27:27,547 --> 01:27:30,083
what difference does it make
if you do or you don’t?

1090
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:32,418
I swear to Christ,
I don’t know what they’re talking about.

1091
01:27:32,485 --> 01:27:35,889
If you’re moved, somebody’s doing it.
Doesn’t that have to be right, Bob?

1092
01:27:35,956 --> 01:27:38,759
- Yes, it does.
- Can we get some help up here, Lieu?

1093
01:27:38,825 --> 01:27:40,761
- Bob. Bob.
- Yes, Tim?

1094
01:27:40,827 --> 01:27:42,996
Bobby.

1095
01:27:43,063 --> 01:27:45,065
You remember that girl that time, Bob?

1096
01:27:48,201 --> 01:27:50,136
Tim?

1097
01:27:57,878 --> 01:28:00,646
You shot my partner, you fucking nigger.
I’m gonna kill you.

1098
01:28:00,714 --> 01:28:02,716
- Who’s got a walkie?
- Get low. Get low.

1099
01:28:02,783 --> 01:28:04,785
<i>We need a stretcher in here.</i>

1100
01:31:18,879 --> 01:31:20,947
Came for me, motherfucker?

1101
01:31:21,014 --> 01:31:24,217
- What you want me for?
- I came here to kill you.

1102
01:31:24,284 --> 01:31:27,888
Yeah, well, you forgot your gun, Jim.
Where’s your gun?

1103
01:31:36,930 --> 01:31:39,833
That’s death calling, baby –
for you and for me.

1104
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:43,904
- Should I use you to bargain my way out of here?
- You know they won’t bargain for me.

1105
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:47,040
Yeah, that’s so, ain’t it?
Well, then I guess I best help myself.

1106
01:31:47,107 --> 01:31:50,844
You sorry fuckin’ sack of shit.

1107
01:31:52,212 --> 01:31:54,180
You shot my partner.

1108
01:31:54,247 --> 01:31:57,851
<i>Yeah, man, and you could have paid me back</i>
<i>if you would’ve brought your gun.</i>

1109
01:31:57,918 --> 01:32:00,453
<i>That was your mistake, man.</i>

1110
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,489
- What’s your name?
- Gold.

1111
01:32:04,490 --> 01:32:06,459
Robert Gold.

1112
01:32:06,526 --> 01:32:09,529
Well, Mr. Gold, I’m just about
on my way out of here.

1113
01:32:09,595 --> 01:32:12,265
I got a moment.
You want to tell me your last thought?

1114
01:32:12,332 --> 01:32:15,368
- No.
- <i>You want to beg for your life?</i>

1115
01:32:15,435 --> 01:32:17,370
No.

1116
01:32:17,437 --> 01:32:19,039
No?

1117
01:32:19,105 --> 01:32:20,874
It’s not worth anything.

1118
01:32:20,941 --> 01:32:24,778
Well, ain’t that a shame, huh?
After all your trials, you come down to nothin’.

1119
01:32:24,845 --> 01:32:26,780
<i>Yeah. These motherfuckers got lucky.</i>

1120
01:32:26,847 --> 01:32:29,783
<i>An hour ago, I would have been</i>
<i>on a plane, long gone out of here.</i>

1121
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:31,952
No. You weren’t going anywhere.

1122
01:32:32,018 --> 01:32:33,954
<i>What the fuck you know, man?</i>

1123
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:36,322
<i>My mama had it all set up.</i>

1124
01:32:36,389 --> 01:32:39,793
The ticket, the passport.
I would have been long gone out of here.

1125
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:43,163
But that’s all right.
Now I gotta do it the hard way. You know?

1126
01:32:43,229 --> 01:32:47,100
- Yeah. I know it all.
- Oh, you know, huh?

1127
01:32:48,268 --> 01:32:51,571
You’re one smart kike, ain’t you, Mr. Gold?

1128
01:32:51,637 --> 01:32:54,941
All you forgot is that,
if you want to kill me...

1129
01:32:55,008 --> 01:32:57,010
you best come armed.

1130
01:32:59,512 --> 01:33:01,181
Randolph.

1131
01:33:01,247 --> 01:33:03,583
<i>Randolph.</i>

1132
01:33:03,649 --> 01:33:06,452
- Later, baby.
- <i>Your mother turned you in.</i>

1133
01:33:06,519 --> 01:33:08,621
You know she did it.

1134
01:33:08,689 --> 01:33:11,825
- How else did we find you here?
- You’re a lying motherfucker, man.

1135
01:33:11,892 --> 01:33:14,594
You don’t know my mother.
You ain’t never seen my mother.

1136
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,703
I –

1137
01:33:22,769 --> 01:33:25,338
Look at you, man.
You’re a piece of shit.

1138
01:33:25,405 --> 01:33:27,407
That’s right.

1139
01:33:27,473 --> 01:33:29,609
I am a piece of shit.

1140
01:33:29,676 --> 01:33:32,012
<i>It’s all a piece of shit.</i>

1141
01:33:32,078 --> 01:33:36,616
I killed my partner,
and your mama turned you in.

1142
01:33:36,683 --> 01:33:38,518
Don’t die with a lie on your lips, man.

1143
01:33:38,584 --> 01:33:42,522
You want your passport?
I got it.

1144
01:33:42,588 --> 01:33:45,025
<i>It’s a phony.</i>

1145
01:33:45,091 --> 01:33:47,694
<i>All that shit, man – we made it up.</i>

1146
01:33:47,761 --> 01:33:49,529
Look at it.

1147
01:33:49,595 --> 01:33:53,533
<i>Your mama turned you over, man.</i>
<i>Look at it!</i>

1148
01:34:02,208 --> 01:34:04,144
<i>That’s right.</i>

1149
01:34:16,022 --> 01:34:18,024
God.

1150
01:34:19,325 --> 01:34:21,327
God help me.

1151
01:34:30,804 --> 01:34:33,774
- What did you do to me?
<i>- Six to H.R.T. base.</i>

1152
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,776
<i>You’re secure now.</i>

1153
01:34:37,377 --> 01:34:40,513
<i>Base to Six. Copy. 12-15 standing down.</i>

1154
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:43,717
<i>And you can report landline.</i>
<i>Base clear.</i>

1155
01:34:43,784 --> 01:34:46,419
- I’m all right.
- Got an entrance wound.
Upper-right chest area.

1156
01:34:46,486 --> 01:34:48,554
- Keep the light on him.
- I’m okay.

1157
01:34:48,621 --> 01:34:51,124
Priority wound alert to shock trauma unit.

1158
01:34:53,559 --> 01:34:56,229
- It’s all in order. Good job. Thanks.
<i>- Do you want them now?</i>

1159
01:34:56,296 --> 01:34:58,932
- <i>When you get back there.</i>
<i>- Want me to send them downtown?</i>

1160
01:34:58,999 --> 01:35:01,001
- Let me look at ’em.
- All right.

1161
01:35:06,072 --> 01:35:08,341
<i>You want to hear the rest of this or not?</i>

1162
01:35:08,408 --> 01:35:10,510
- <i>Tell me later.</i>
- Okay. Get out of here.

1163
01:35:10,576 --> 01:35:13,680
- <i>Now don’t go bossing me around.</i>
- I’m not bossing you. I’m begging you.

1164
01:35:13,747 --> 01:35:15,682
- See you later.
- See ya.

1165
01:35:15,749 --> 01:35:18,451
<i>When you get down on Fifth Street,</i>
<i>you’re going to see what I mean.</i>

1166
01:35:18,518 --> 01:35:23,123
- Who do I talk to down there?
- - <i>When they gave up the shotgun –</i> <i>When they come in with the shotgun –</i>

1167
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:25,591
- <i>They –</i>
- Hey, Bob.

1168
01:35:25,659 --> 01:35:27,894
- Hello.
- Hi.

1169
01:35:27,961 --> 01:35:31,131
I’m sorry about Sullivan.

1170
01:35:32,699 --> 01:35:34,634
Yeah.

1171
01:35:38,805 --> 01:35:40,874
We gotta roll.

1172
01:35:40,941 --> 01:35:42,909
Yeah.

1173
01:35:42,976 --> 01:35:45,411
<i>Maybe I’ll see you later.</i>

1174
01:35:45,478 --> 01:35:47,914
Have some coffee.

1175
01:35:47,981 --> 01:35:50,751
See ya around, Bob.

1176
01:35:50,817 --> 01:35:52,953
Yeah.

1177
01:35:53,019 --> 01:35:55,355
All right.
Now, what are you gonna bring me back?

1178
01:35:55,421 --> 01:35:57,858
- I bring back the whole consignment.
- And log it in.

1179
01:35:57,924 --> 01:36:00,060
- <i>Should I take a car?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1180
01:36:00,126 --> 01:36:02,528
<i>That way you get the shotgun,</i>
<i>we log it...</i>

1181
01:36:02,595 --> 01:36:04,597
<i>we match it for prints and ballistics.</i>

1182
01:36:04,665 --> 01:36:06,733
<i>The shell is distinct.</i>
<i>I’ll get on that right away.</i>

1183
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,735
<i>That’s exactly what I wanted to do.</i>

1184
01:36:08,802 --> 01:36:11,537
<i>That’s just the way it is.</i>
<i>You took your shot, this is what happened.</i>

1185
01:36:11,604 --> 01:36:14,975
And if you’re moved, somebody’s gotta be doing it.
Doesn’t that have to be right?

1186
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:17,343
<i>I want you to do the following thing.</i>

1187
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:20,881
<i>Log this stuff in, Frank,</i>
<i>and then when you get downtown, you –</i>

1188
01:36:22,115 --> 01:36:24,517
We solved your case for you.

1189
01:36:24,584 --> 01:36:26,586
<i>Come on.</i>

1190
01:36:26,653 --> 01:36:30,857
I told you why we killed her, man –
because she had that fortune in her basement.

1191
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,330
You’re off Homicide.

1192
01:36:39,465 --> 01:36:41,467
You’re off.

1193
01:36:43,303 --> 01:36:45,371
- Let’s go.
<i>- We would have got it, too...</i>

1194
01:36:45,438 --> 01:36:48,308
- if that dog wouldn’t have scared us off.
- Get ’em out of here.

1195
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:40,794
<i>We’ve been holding this for ya.</i>

1196
01:37:41,305 --> 01:38:41,360

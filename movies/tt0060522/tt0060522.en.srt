Sold. $90,000 to this gentleman in
front of me just here. Thank you, sir.

3
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:02,359
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

4
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:07,334
number 34 on the front
cover of your catalogs.

5
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,230
Color plate 16.

6
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:14,975
Portrait of Madame de
Nemours by Cיzanne.

7
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:22,920
Now, because of the interest
in this painting...

8
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:27,589
we are keeping telephone lines open
to our buyers in London and New York.

9
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:32,365
This great painting is from the
world-famous Bonnet collection...

10
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:35,035
sold by order of the present
head of the family...

11
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:39,536
<i>Monsieur</i> Charles Bonnet.

12
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:45,445
Now ladies and gentlemen...

13
00:02:45,446 --> 00:02:49,249
who will start this superb
Postimpressionist masterpiece...

14
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,816
at $200,000?

15
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:58,447
$210,000. $220,000!

16
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,294
$230,000. Thank you.

17
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:04,253
Now who says $240,000?

18
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,023
Thank you very much.

19
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:11,066
Who says $240,000?

20
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:13,132
Thank you.

21
00:03:17,144 --> 00:03:19,505
$260,000.

22
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:22,046
$270,000.

23
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:35,121
<i>Equal this record in the
coming three months.</i>

24
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:37,626
<i>And now, in the world of art...</i>

25
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:41,000
<i>in an auction of notable
Impressionist masterpieces...</i>

26
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:44,104
<i>the highest price paid was
for a Cיzanne portrait...</i>

27
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:47,399
<i>from the great private
collection of Charles Bonnet...</i>

28
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:52,943
sold after spirited
bidding for $515,000.

29
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,415
<i>The buyer, himself a
notable art collector....</i>

30
00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:24,778
- Good evening, Marcel.
- Evening, <i>mademoiselle</i>.

31
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,180
- Is my father home?
- He is upstairs.

32
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:30,077
- Shall I tell him?
- No, thank you. I'll go up.

33
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:03,342
Hello, my darling!

34
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:05,483
Hello, Papa.

35
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:09,813
- Careful. I'm covered with paint.
- And with money.

36
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,725
I heard all about the
auction on the radio.

37
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:15,295
We've got to have a
long, serious talk.

38
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:17,197
My dear angel, it was a triumph.

39
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:19,599
I could have sold a dozen
Cיzannes on the spot.

40
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,928
When is enough more than enough?
This has got to stop.

41
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:24,564
One moment.

42
00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:32,044
How kind of van Gogh to
use only his first name.

43
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:36,107
I can sign him in half the time.

44
00:05:36,784 --> 00:05:38,918
There. Perfect!

45
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,520
Not again, Papa? So soon?

46
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,259
This long-lost masterpiece will
not be for sale for a long time.

47
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,396
We'll hang it. It'll be admired. Who knows?
In time, some legendary tycoon...

48
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:53,166
may be able to persuade
me to part with it.

49
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,393
- You're such a scoundrel.
- Thank you, my child.

50
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:59,332
Nicole! My dirt.

51
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:03,142
This is not ordinary dirt.
It is van Gogh dirt.

52
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:05,709
I mean dirt from his
own neighborhood.

53
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,016
I scraped it myself off these
old 19th-century canvases.

54
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:11,309
Like this.

55
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,853
It took me weeks.

56
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:16,716
A nice touch of authenticity,
don't you think?

57
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:21,294
I doubt if van Gogh himself would've
gone to such pains with his works.

58
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:23,895
He didn't have to. He was van Gogh.

59
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:28,935
But you know that in his whole
lifetime, he only sold one painting.

60
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:32,833
Whereas I, in loving memory
of his great tragic genius...

61
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:34,807
have already sold two.

62
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,839
Papa, I keep telling you...

63
00:06:36,977 --> 00:06:41,014
when you sell a fake
masterpiece, that is a crime.

64
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,582
I don't sell to the poor.

65
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:46,879
I only sell them to millionaires and
they get great paintings like this one.

66
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:11,374
Papa! Police!

67
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,297
What a shock you gave me.

68
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:33,833
It's the director of the
Klיber-Lafayette Museum.

69
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,002
Come about our Cellini Venus.

70
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:38,338
What about the Venus?

71
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,307
Our Cellini Venus is to be
the outstanding feature...

72
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:45,137
of a great loan exhibition,
Masterpieces of French Collections.

73
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,648
Not in public, Papa!

74
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,544
- Yes. Come along.
- No!

75
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:58,090
Wait a minute. You can't
let it out of the house.

76
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,152
Don't fuss.

77
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:05,062
But, Papa, this is insane.

78
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:10,169
I'm coming, <i>Monsieur</i> Grammont.

79
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,632
Take your time.

80
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,943
- I beg you. Listen to me.
- Do you see any paint anywhere?

81
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:18,702
Do I smell of paint?

82
00:08:18,712 --> 00:08:22,815
I beg of you, will you listen to me?
The Cellini Venus is a fake.

83
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:27,783
- That's a word we don't use in this house.
- It's too dangerous. I can't let you do this.

84
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:30,148
Papa, will you listen to me?

85
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:33,520
Stop spraying and.... All right.

86
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,995
Come along, you'll like
<i>Monsieur</i> Grammont.

87
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:38,756
He's impeccably honest
and extremely dull.

88
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:48,041
My dear Grammont. How kind
of you to come in person.

89
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:51,370
- Good evening, Bonnet.
- My pleasure, I can assure you.

90
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:57,606
Marcel, the doors. Allow me to
present my daughter, Nicole.

91
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:04,756
- Delighted, <i>mademoiselle</i>.
- Good evening.

92
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:10,993
There she is.

93
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:21,335
Allow me.

94
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,882
I remember it as a work
of art, but it is more.

95
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:39,058
My friend, I express my own
and the museum's gratitude...

96
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,829
for your generous loan, and I thank
you on behalf of France itself...

97
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,498
for never letting this
treasure leave the country.

98
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:49,931
I know of the offers you must have had
and how tempting they must have been.

99
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:53,133
One is, after all,
always a Frenchman.

100
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,538
- I'll get it for you.
- No.

101
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:03,974
Please.

102
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,584
Look, Papa, let me help you.

103
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:10,614
Into your hands...

104
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:12,325
- my dear Grammont...
- Me?

105
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:14,756
I give this, our ultimate treasure.

106
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,244
Papa, what have you done?

107
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:08,073
The room doesn't look
the same without her.

108
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,830
What have I done?

109
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:28,234
I'm giving the world an opportunity of
studying and viewing the Cellini Venus.

110
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:30,236
Which is not by Cellini.

111
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:33,339
Labels! It's working
with the Americans...

112
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,509
that's given you this obsession
with labels and brand names.

113
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,711
I wish you'd give up
that ridiculous job.

114
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:43,015
Don't you know you can't fake sculpture
anymore? It's not like painting.

115
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:46,549
I know about their so-called tests.

116
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:49,822
Papa, they are not
so-called. They are!

117
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:54,952
One quick whiff of something
called potassium argon...

118
00:11:55,062 --> 00:12:00,097
and they can tell the age of the stone,
where it was quarried, when it was cut...

119
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,902
and the name and address
of the man who did it.

120
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:04,937
Why do you suppose
I haven't sold it?

121
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:08,407
I was offered recently.... It gives
me a twinge when I think of it.

122
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,677
I was offered $1,000,000.
But I won't sell it.

123
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:14,972
I don't even charge rent.
So, why should they test it?

124
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:19,552
Did you hear Grammont say
100,000 souvenir postcards!

125
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:22,421
They'll be mailed all over
the world. Our Venus!

126
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:25,250
Don't you feel a kind of
thrilling glow in that?

127
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:27,651
Chills run up and down my spine.

128
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:30,988
The basic trouble with you
is that you're honest.

129
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:34,532
I don't say that to
hurt your feelings.

130
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:38,067
I get dizzy spells when we have
these conversations, Papa.

131
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:40,902
What you need is a brandy.

132
00:12:42,342 --> 00:12:46,512
My darling, what you must understand
is that I am pleased and proud...

133
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:50,783
that our Cellini Venus is a forgery.
If it were genuine, what would it be?

134
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:55,488
A piece of sculpture made centuries
ago by some over-sexed Italian.

135
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:58,758
But our Cellini Venus is really
our own. So, be proud of it.

136
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,428
Your own grandfather made it, and
your own grandmother posed for it.

137
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:04,864
For months she stood
without moving a muscle...

138
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:07,433
while your grandfather
perpetuated her in marble.

139
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:11,468
That was, naturally, before she started
eating those enormous lunches.

140
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:38,346
- Back to the hotel, please.
- Yes, Mr. Leland.

141
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:43,429
Miss Treadwell,
type this up immediately.

142
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,165
Do it yourself and send it
to all parties concerned.

143
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:49,802
Cancel all travel arrangements and
business meetings Near and Far East.

144
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:53,172
Remaining in Paris on urgent business
regarding my art foundation.

145
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:56,042
Further instructions will
be issued as needed.

146
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:59,011
Paris office: Do a run-down
on Charles Bonnet...

147
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:02,048
this city, all members of his
family, his art collection...

148
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:05,551
and particularly the Cellini
Venus, which is now on exhibition.

149
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:08,254
Have all this information
at my hotel in the morning.

150
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:10,719
This is urgent, repeat, urgent.

151
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:13,116
And confidential.

152
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:45,103
Don't move.

153
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,714
Put down that painting.

154
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:54,047
Put it down!

155
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,264
- Miss Bonnet, please....
- Stay where you are!

156
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,851
Why did you choose that
particular painting?

157
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,314
It was the handiest.

158
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:35,521
Look, don't call the police.
Give me another chance.

159
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,562
You see, I was only taking one
painting and you've got so many.

160
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:45,332
The chances were you
wouldn't have missed it.

161
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,202
I'll put it back.

162
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:07,559
It's beautiful. A pity.

163
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,224
You knew my father and the
servants were out. How?

164
00:19:14,434 --> 00:19:17,228
It's my business to
know things like that.

165
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,630
Look, if I frightened you,
I'm really terribly sorry.

166
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:25,002
I thought you'd be at the
opening with your father.

167
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:27,770
Big event like that....

168
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,183
Anyway, you frightened
me, so we're even.

169
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:37,556
Don't be impudent.

170
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:41,722
That thing isn't loaded, is it?

171
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:44,194
Of course it is.

172
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:56,274
- Are you armed?
- Wait.

173
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:58,133
Do you have a gun?

174
00:19:58,545 --> 00:19:59,973
Good God, no!

175
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:12,552
I'm going to let you go.

176
00:20:12,926 --> 00:20:14,787
I don't know why, but....

177
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:11,649
I'm the one that's bleeding.

178
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:20,116
- What's that?
- Iodine.

179
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:22,721
Will it hurt?

180
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:24,997
For a burglar, you're not
very brave, are you?

181
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:29,191
I'm a society burglar. I don't expect
people to rush about shooting me.

182
00:21:30,036 --> 00:21:32,568
Take your hand away so I
can put this stuff on.

183
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:38,469
That hurt.

184
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:41,780
Don't be such a baby.
It's only a flesh wound.

185
00:21:41,781 --> 00:21:43,539
It happens to be my flesh.

186
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:46,218
You have to expect some
occupational hazards.

187
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:48,554
You broke in here to steal!

188
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:51,417
Could we keep personalities
out of this conversation?

189
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:55,694
Fine. A thing like this could
keep me out of action for a week.

190
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:58,056
Temporarily, you'll
have to go straight.

191
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:01,867
Look, it's late and I'm tired, and
I have to work in the morning.

192
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:03,399
You work?

193
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,065
Some people do, you know.

194
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:07,864
All right. I'm going.

195
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:16,675
How do I get home? I can't drive.

196
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:22,349
I feel weak from shock
and loss of blood.

197
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:25,652
Dear heaven!

198
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:31,256
I'll call you a taxi. And pay for it.
Is that all right?

199
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,827
As far as I'm concerned, fine...

200
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:38,863
but if the police found my
car outside your house...

201
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:42,839
it would mean questions,
and I'm wanted, you know.

202
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:45,067
I'm really thinking of you.

203
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:51,641
Thank you very much.

204
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:56,349
- I'll drive you home. Is that okay with you?
- Fine, thank you.

205
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:10,430
You don't happen to have
a cigarette, do you?

206
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:17,668
Here.

207
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,476
Pretty, isn't she? She'll do
more than 150 miles an hour.

208
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:54,379
Useful for getaways, you see.

209
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:01,976
The robbery business
must be pretty good.

210
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,386
It's stolen.

211
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:06,892
I can't drive a stolen car!

212
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:09,595
Same principle. Four gears
forward, one reverse.

213
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:13,357
This is crazy. You should be in
jail, and I should be in bed.

214
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:19,765
All right. Where to?

215
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:21,265
The Ritz.

216
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:23,441
The what?

217
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,111
The Hotel Ritz in
the Place Vendפme.

218
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:30,976
I know where it is. You're a
very chic burglar, aren't you?

219
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:03,512
Your arm is much better.

220
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,875
No. It hurts.

221
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,180
It's the other arm.

222
00:25:08,755 --> 00:25:10,855
The infection is spreading.

223
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:24,903
We got here alive. Thank you.

224
00:25:24,904 --> 00:25:29,063
- And if ever I can return the favor...
- Hardly likely to happen, is it?

225
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:32,268
Now how do I get home?

226
00:25:32,445 --> 00:25:35,944
You see, you never can tell
when you might need a friend.

227
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:42,978
Good evening, Mr. Dermott.

228
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:44,779
Armand, I want a taxi.

229
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,891
Yes, Mr. Dermott. Right away.

230
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:50,189
Transportation laid on.

231
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:51,553
Taxi.

232
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:57,769
Gave myself away there, didn't I?
Now you know my name. Can't be helped.

233
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,506
Besides, I have a funny feeling, believe
me, it's rare in my profession...

234
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:03,937
that you're completely trustworthy.

235
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,084
Just one more tiny favor:

236
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:15,554
Like an idiot, I forgot to wear gloves.
I may have left fingerprints.

237
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:17,222
Be an angel. Before
you go to bed...

238
00:26:17,223 --> 00:26:21,723
give the frame of the painting a
little wipe with a clean cloth, okay?

239
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:25,127
Certainly. Anything else?

240
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:28,763
You wouldn't like a forged passport
or some counterfeit money or....

241
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:34,272
You're mad, utterly mad. I suppose
you want to kiss me good night.

242
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:36,808
I don't usually, not on
the first acquaintance...

243
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,307
but you've been such a good sport.

244
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:04,536
38, rue Parmentier.
Drive carefully.

245
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:06,500
Get a good night's sleep.

246
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:06,832
Nicole, my darling, what a
pity you missed the opening.

247
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:10,135
Our Cellini Venus was
a tremendous success.

248
00:28:10,136 --> 00:28:12,103
You should have seen the crowds.

249
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:13,772
- Thousands of them.
- I want to....

250
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:15,874
Photographers from
all nationalities...

251
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:19,311
with our Cellini Venus the
center of the whole attraction.

252
00:28:19,312 --> 00:28:22,447
Papa, I caught a burglar.

253
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:23,782
Of course you did.

254
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:27,248
But you must promise me to go
there and see for yourself.

255
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:29,914
A burglar?

256
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,887
What? Here in this house?

257
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:35,858
Good Lord.

258
00:28:36,262 --> 00:28:41,195
Here, take a sip of this and
just tell me all about it.

259
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:45,769
It was pitch dark and there he was.

260
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:51,269
Tall, blue eyes, slim,
quite good-looking...

261
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:56,114
in a brutal, mean way.
Papa, a terrible man.

262
00:28:56,115 --> 00:29:00,581
Arrogant, ruthless, no
sense of guilt or shame...

263
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,985
or anything.

264
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:06,989
So you discussed all that, did you?

265
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:10,287
That was later, when I
was driving him home.

266
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:17,624
I had to, Papa, I shot him in
the arm with your old pistol...

267
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:21,306
but it was an accident, I think....

268
00:29:21,307 --> 00:29:22,940
My darling...

269
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:29,014
supposing you start all over again
and tell me what happened in detail.

270
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:31,979
I caught him in the
act of stealing.

271
00:29:32,018 --> 00:29:34,286
I kept him back with the pistol...

272
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:37,589
and I was telephoning the police
when I saw what he was stealing.

273
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,725
- The van Gogh, your van Gogh.
- What?

274
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,827
And I didn't know what to do.

275
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:45,830
I was afraid if he was arrested
it might mean publicity.

276
00:29:45,831 --> 00:29:49,401
Of course. A police investigation,
that might have been very awkward.

277
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:51,870
- That's what I thought. So I let him go.
- Good!

278
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:56,174
- I did the right thing, didn't I?
- Of course. Maybe he was a first offender.

279
00:29:56,175 --> 00:30:00,436
If you'd have seen how he was carrying
on when I was dressing his wound.

280
00:30:01,514 --> 00:30:06,276
He might have got an infection.
The whole thing was too awful, Papa.

281
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:08,451
Good night, Papa.

282
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:10,382
Good night, my darling.

283
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:40,284
Have a good sleep.

284
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:50,662
This tall, good-looking
ruffian with blue eyes...

285
00:30:50,663 --> 00:30:54,959
he didn't molest you
in any way, did he?

286
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:05,169
Not much.

287
00:32:06,906 --> 00:32:08,266
Sorry.

288
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:10,341
Good morning.

289
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:13,340
We meet only under the most
artistic circumstances.

290
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:17,013
Beautiful!

291
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:20,149
You wouldn't dare.

292
00:32:20,786 --> 00:32:23,079
Fear nothing, I'm off duty.

293
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,422
Miss Bonnet. A pleasure
to have you here.

294
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:33,223
Mr. Grammont, the Director
of the Museum, and....

295
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:35,300
- Delighted.
- How do you do, sir.

296
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:38,061
We are old friends. We
used to shoot together.

297
00:32:38,637 --> 00:32:41,704
Wonderful exhibition.
So many beautiful things.

298
00:32:41,874 --> 00:32:44,542
- And so valuable!
- Yes.

299
00:32:44,543 --> 00:32:47,178
And observe, please, the
security precautions...

300
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:49,404
protecting your great sculpture.

301
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:52,880
- Are you interested in art, Mr. Dermott?
- Indeed I am.

302
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:57,077
- And in security.
- Splendid. Let me show you, please.

303
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:03,252
Excuse me. You see
those tiny blue beams.

304
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:05,497
They are infrared circuits.

305
00:33:05,498 --> 00:33:08,366
- I have to go.
- Go on. I find it fascinating.

306
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:09,601
Be careful.

307
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:14,038
Because those beams create a
circuit around the Venus...

308
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,208
and anything that breaks the
circuit, instant alarm!

309
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:19,010
Bravo! Thank you...

310
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:21,646
It's the Electric Eye
Detection and Alarm System.

311
00:33:21,647 --> 00:33:23,648
We call it the E.D.A.S.

312
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:25,043
- Very clever.
- Nice.

313
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:28,045
I know the question
you're going to ask:

314
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:30,889
"What if a burglar got to it
and turned off the alarm?"

315
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,957
No. The thought never
entered my mind.

316
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:35,460
Funny, I was going to
ask that very thing.

317
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:39,222
Good question.
The answer is, he cannot.

318
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:43,034
You see, it operates like the door to a
vault, and only two trusted guards...

319
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:45,270
and myself of course,
know the combination.

320
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:47,338
- Let me show you...
- I have an appointment.

321
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:49,774
- Goodbye.
- I can spare a few minutes.

322
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:53,570
- You're coming with me. Aren't you?
- All right. If you insist. Bye-bye.

323
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:58,476
Now go away or I'll
call a policeman.

324
00:33:59,185 --> 00:34:01,114
Yours is a capricious nature.

325
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,917
Do you always blow hot
and cold like this? Say!

326
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:08,293
Listen. I have something very
important to say to you.

327
00:34:08,294 --> 00:34:09,791
Now don't go away.

328
00:34:22,942 --> 00:34:24,442
Well, finally!

329
00:34:24,443 --> 00:34:27,979
I waited at the Ritz for you last night.
I thought you'd been caught.

330
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,347
- No.
- What happened?

331
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:32,183
I'm only a part-time
burglar, and it's hard work.

332
00:34:32,184 --> 00:34:33,985
Did you find the van Gogh?

333
00:34:33,986 --> 00:34:36,313
- Easily.
- And?

334
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:41,854
It disturbs you, doesn't it?

335
00:34:42,294 --> 00:34:43,722
Not a bit.

336
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:46,660
It's a great van Gogh.

337
00:34:47,198 --> 00:34:49,992
Of course it is, but
who painted it?

338
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:54,072
My dear Bernard, Bonnet has a
Cellini sculpture on exhibition...

339
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:58,334
right now which is worth $1,000,000.
He doesn't need to forge paintings.

340
00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:01,879
- Unless you think that's a forgery too.
- No, not that!

341
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,184
For one thing, it was first exhibited in
1910 when Bonnet was eight years old.

342
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:10,515
Besides, Bonnet never studied sculpture.
But he did study painting.

343
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:14,058
If he has $1,000,000
lying around loose...

344
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:16,761
why does he forge paintings?
What's his motive?

345
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:19,797
Ego, vanity, hoodwinking
the whole world...

346
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:21,866
and having a wonderful
time doing it.

347
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:24,902
Simon, imagine Bonnet
as a young painter.

348
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:28,206
Like many others he copies the
masters to learn their secrets.

349
00:35:28,207 --> 00:35:29,474
It is his hobby.

350
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:31,776
But over the years, it
becomes an obsession.

351
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:36,641
He learned every nuance of light,
of color, of shade, of form.

352
00:35:36,749 --> 00:35:38,974
He identifies with them completely.

353
00:35:39,051 --> 00:35:41,586
When he paints a van
Gogh, he is van Gogh.

354
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:46,349
He's Lautrec, Cיzanne, he's any painter he
chooses to be, and that is his motive...

355
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:48,623
and also his profit.

356
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:53,153
- What about Bonnet's daughter?
- Nicole? What about her?

357
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:56,334
- Do you think she's in it with him?
- In what?

358
00:35:56,335 --> 00:35:58,833
According to you, there is nothing.

359
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:01,665
- That's right.
- You're wrong. And you'll see.

360
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:04,373
Come in.

361
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:08,780
- Hello, Papa.
- Good evening, my dear.

362
00:36:08,781 --> 00:36:10,915
Marcel tells me you're dining out.

363
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:13,674
With an American
tycoon I met today.

364
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:16,350
- He makes computers.
- What?

365
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:20,387
Well, that might be the basis
of an enduring friendship.

366
00:36:22,328 --> 00:36:25,088
And there he is. Right
on the executive button.

367
00:36:25,664 --> 00:36:28,458
An enormous Cadillac.
Does that sound right?

368
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:31,395
- What's his name?
- Davis Leland.

369
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:35,440
- Are you sure?
- Do you know him?

370
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,675
No, but I'd very much
like to meet him.

371
00:36:37,676 --> 00:36:41,713
Yes, he is one of the most open-handed
art collectors in the whole of America.

372
00:36:41,714 --> 00:36:43,575
I'll go and keep him company.

373
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:45,616
He didn't say a word
about a collection.

374
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:48,786
Didn't he tell you that he's got
the great Toulouse-Lautrec...

375
00:36:48,787 --> 00:36:50,648
from the Bonnet collection?

376
00:36:51,924 --> 00:36:54,649
Your Lautrec or Lautrec's Lautrec?

377
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,095
Mine, naturally.

378
00:36:57,096 --> 00:36:58,786
Oh, no.

379
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,524
Are you implying that my Lautrec
is in any way inferior?

380
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,068
Listen, Papa.

381
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:07,238
He mentioned your name as though
it were only vaguely familiar.

382
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:10,074
Not only didn't he mention
anything about a collection...

383
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:12,539
he said he didn't like art at all.

384
00:37:13,178 --> 00:37:15,005
He suspects something.

385
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:18,306
He must have arranged to meet me.

386
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:20,985
I find that rather intriguing.

387
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:23,814
I'll go and meet him.

388
00:37:40,072 --> 00:37:44,174
A lovely dinner. Marvelous wine.
How did you know how to choose it?

389
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,938
I own a vineyard.

390
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:48,112
Well, what fun!

391
00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:52,450
- It's a subsidiary of Eastern Coal and Coke.
- Eastern Coal and Coke?

392
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:55,620
That's a subsidiary of
Western Wool and Flax.

393
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:59,450
Fascinating.
What's your growth factor?

394
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:03,227
Say! You're marvelous.
You're wonderful.

395
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:06,330
You know, usually I have
trouble talking with girls...

396
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:10,365
but with you, it's as though you
were a member of the Board.

397
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,504
That's very nice of
you, Mr. Leland.

398
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:19,405
But I wish I didn't have this feeling that
there's a subject you're trying to avoid.

399
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:23,681
There is something, isn't there?

400
00:38:23,682 --> 00:38:27,147
Yes. I hate to say this.

401
00:38:30,389 --> 00:38:33,149
But you see, it has to
do with your father...

402
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,656
and the Bonnet collection.

403
00:38:36,495 --> 00:38:39,831
Yes. You see.... Damn it,
this is hard for me to say.

404
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:42,057
- Mr. Davis Leland?
- Yes.

405
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:45,395
Long-distance call, Mr. Leland.
United States. California.

406
00:38:46,038 --> 00:38:48,706
How the devil did they
track me down here?

407
00:38:48,707 --> 00:38:51,102
Please excuse me.
I'll cut it short.

408
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:16,601
- Oh, no!
- Not a very cordial greeting.

409
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:20,338
I went to considerable trouble to arrange
these few precious moments alone.

410
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:24,008
- Leave the table.
- It's National Crime Prevention Week.

411
00:39:24,009 --> 00:39:27,912
- Take a Burglar to Dinner.
- My escort has a very ugly temper.

412
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:30,448
Now go and call off that
fake telephone call.

413
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:32,016
There's something I must tell you.

414
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:34,919
- How I'd like to take another shot at you!
- It's important!

415
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,214
<i>Quittez pas!</i> What is that?

416
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:41,225
I'm going to <i>quittez pas</i> right now.

417
00:39:41,226 --> 00:39:43,928
Either you leave this table
or I start screaming.

418
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:45,863
- Yes, I'll go.
- Choose!

419
00:39:45,864 --> 00:39:47,865
Just tell me where and
when we can meet.

420
00:39:47,866 --> 00:39:49,795
Choose! And make it fast!

421
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:57,504
Remember, Simon Dermott.
Room 136, the Ritz. It's urgent.

422
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:04,807
The Ritz!

423
00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:11,952
Now, where were we?

424
00:40:12,324 --> 00:40:14,355
With my father and his collection.

425
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:15,952
Oh, yes.

426
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:19,686
I hate to have to tell
you this, Miss Bonnet.

427
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:24,168
- I arranged our meeting.
- Why?

428
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:27,998
It's this ridiculous obsession.
It devours me.

429
00:40:28,273 --> 00:40:31,676
From the minute I first laid eyes
on it, I was lost, helpless...

430
00:40:31,677 --> 00:40:35,074
completely caught up in
this awful compulsion.

431
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:38,881
Laid eyes on what?

432
00:40:38,884 --> 00:40:42,587
The Cellini Venus, of course.
I saw it last night. It haunted me.

433
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:45,790
I can't think of anything else.
I haven't slept a wink all night.

434
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:48,392
Today, when I learned your
father wouldn't sell it...

435
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:50,261
I started pulling
strings to meet you...

436
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:53,590
hoping somehow to use
you to get the Venus.

437
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,299
Well, that's it.

438
00:40:56,602 --> 00:41:00,471
- You poor, dear man!
- No!

439
00:41:00,472 --> 00:41:01,906
Don't spare my feelings.

440
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:05,109
I'm sorry you fell in love with
the Venus. She's not for sale.

441
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,939
Believe me, if she were mine, she'd
be on your doorstep in the morning.

442
00:41:09,181 --> 00:41:11,508
That's your consolation prize.

443
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,042
- Well, you kissed me!
- Yes.

444
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:16,619
And that's for emphasis.

445
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:25,457
- Shall we dance?
- Oh, yes!

446
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:31,936
Good morning, my dear.

447
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:34,867
- I'll call Marcel.
- No, thank you, Papa. I'm late.

448
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:39,176
I just have to tell you
about Davis Leland.

449
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:40,776
Everything's fine.

450
00:41:41,013 --> 00:41:44,682
As far as Davis Leland is concerned,
you can go on faking masterpieces...

451
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:47,018
as long as you can hold a brush.

452
00:41:47,019 --> 00:41:50,421
He cooked up a big plot to meet me
just to get to you through me...

453
00:41:50,422 --> 00:41:52,749
hoping that way he'd
get the Cellini.

454
00:41:52,758 --> 00:41:56,519
Really? American millionaires
must be all quite mad.

455
00:41:56,762 --> 00:42:00,398
Perhaps it's something they put in
the ink when they print the money.

456
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:02,833
A gentleman to see you, sir.

457
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:06,435
On behalf of the director of the
Klיber-Lafayette Museum, sir.

458
00:42:06,672 --> 00:42:09,363
So early? Show him in, Marcel.

459
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:12,833
Must be a very
enterprising young fellow.

460
00:42:19,785 --> 00:42:22,620
Good morning, sir.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

461
00:42:22,621 --> 00:42:27,792
Just a technicality on the insurance
of your loan of one statue:

462
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:32,730
"twenty-nine inches, in
marble, entitled Venus, by...

463
00:42:32,731 --> 00:42:35,559
"Benvenuto Cellini."

464
00:42:36,468 --> 00:42:38,727
Insurance, on that?

465
00:42:39,404 --> 00:42:43,674
- It's never been insured. It's beyond price!
- Yes. We were aware of that, sir.

466
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:47,572
So special cover was taken over for
its transportation and exhibition.

467
00:42:47,713 --> 00:42:50,381
But by an unfortunate error, sir...

468
00:42:50,382 --> 00:42:53,813
your signature was not
obtained on the document.

469
00:42:54,286 --> 00:42:57,785
There is, of course, no
expense to yourself, sir.

470
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:02,890
A mere formality, for once
you've signed this document...

471
00:43:03,528 --> 00:43:08,791
the work of art is covered until it's
returned to this house in good order.

472
00:43:10,368 --> 00:43:13,704
I just have to sign?
And then it's....

473
00:43:13,705 --> 00:43:16,407
Insured for $1,000,000
against all risks...

474
00:43:16,408 --> 00:43:20,778
including flood, earthquake, thunderbolt,
falling aircraft, loot, sack, pillage...

475
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:24,715
military or civil commotion, fire,
structural collapse of buildings...

476
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:27,646
and, of course, larceny or theft.

477
00:43:33,425 --> 00:43:35,024
Thank you, sir.

478
00:43:37,462 --> 00:43:40,529
By the way, sir, would you
like to be present...

479
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:43,367
at the technical examination?

480
00:43:45,837 --> 00:43:48,301
Technical examination?

481
00:43:48,373 --> 00:43:52,710
Yes, they always require it and you,
of course, have just authorized it.

482
00:43:52,711 --> 00:43:54,640
A mere formality.

483
00:43:54,846 --> 00:43:59,881
I believe they have a Prof. Bauer
flying in from Zurich on Friday.

484
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,453
Well, thank you, sir. And good day.

485
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:06,416
Wait.

486
00:44:27,112 --> 00:44:29,610
Papa, this Prof. Bauer....

487
00:44:30,215 --> 00:44:32,183
Does he know all the tests?

488
00:44:32,184 --> 00:44:34,079
He invented them.

489
00:44:35,253 --> 00:44:39,990
- It's not as if we're trying to sell it.
- My dear, at the first breath of suspicion...

490
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:43,524
the entire myth of the
Bonnet collection explodes.

491
00:44:44,296 --> 00:44:47,832
Everything I've done will be examined
and re-examined with X-rays...

492
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,695
fluoroscopes, microscopes,
shadowgraphs...

493
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:53,527
smelly chemicals and
all sorts of....

494
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,701
We live in a crass, commercial
world, with no faith or trust.

495
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:17,494
We must keep Prof. Bauer
from examining the Venus.

496
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:20,289
But how? I've just
given my permission.

497
00:45:20,332 --> 00:45:22,700
I've not only put my head
into the guillotine...

498
00:45:22,701 --> 00:45:26,997
I've unloosened my collar and tie
so that they can chop it off.

499
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:29,940
At least I can keep you out
of this. Leave Paris.

500
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:33,677
I want you to go to America.
No, go to the Orient or somewhere.

501
00:45:33,678 --> 00:45:36,513
Please, it will be easier
for me, I promise you.

502
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:38,949
I'm not going to leave
you and that's final.

503
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,351
- Sir?
- Yes?

504
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:43,354
- A <i>seסor</i> Paravideo to see you, sir.
- Who?

505
00:45:43,355 --> 00:45:45,887
A South American
gentleman, I believe, sir.

506
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:47,958
Of an excitable nature.

507
00:45:47,959 --> 00:45:50,461
- Who's he?
- I don't know.

508
00:45:50,462 --> 00:45:52,863
Oh, my God!

509
00:45:52,864 --> 00:45:56,693
<i>Mademoiselle, monsieur</i>. I must....

510
00:45:56,902 --> 00:45:58,467
Here it is!

511
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:03,101
Just as you said...

512
00:46:03,675 --> 00:46:05,706
only greater by far!

513
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:10,514
I must apologize. I had an urgent call.
A revolution in my country.

514
00:46:10,515 --> 00:46:13,980
Also, some of my mines are
flooded. I must go back soon.

515
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:19,552
I couldn't bear to leave Paris
without consulting you about this.

516
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,697
- <i>Seסor</i>, it is not for sale.
- But you said you might.... You said you....

517
00:46:26,698 --> 00:46:28,599
It is not for sale!

518
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,997
- Goodbye.
- I can see the hand of a master!

519
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:35,665
Goodbye. <i>Adiףs.</i>

520
00:46:39,277 --> 00:46:40,911
Preposterous little man!

521
00:46:40,912 --> 00:46:43,180
I met him at the auction
when my Cיzanne...

522
00:46:43,181 --> 00:46:45,645
fetched such a stunning price.

523
00:46:46,518 --> 00:46:50,484
Why not? It was worth a
stunning price. Even more!

524
00:46:50,488 --> 00:46:54,758
This will not be a scandal, but a triumph!
Let the experts come pouring in!

525
00:46:54,759 --> 00:46:57,428
Let them bring their X-rays,
their microscopes...

526
00:46:57,429 --> 00:47:00,689
even their nuclear
weapons if they like.

527
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:06,337
Remember what happened
with van Meegeren...

528
00:47:06,338 --> 00:47:09,573
and all those forged Vermeers?
He drove the experts crazy.

529
00:47:09,574 --> 00:47:12,843
He won every round, fought them,
and then emerged the victor.

530
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:17,147
He finally painted one last Vermeer
and even that was a triumph.

531
00:47:17,148 --> 00:47:19,917
The guards marveled at the
brilliance of his brushwork.

532
00:47:19,918 --> 00:47:22,519
Even his fellow inmates
couldn't believe their eyes.

533
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,518
And the governor of
the prison, he....

534
00:47:45,944 --> 00:47:48,339
What's the number
of the Hotel Ritz?

535
00:47:48,947 --> 00:47:50,978
Opera 2830.

536
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:52,932
Good evening.

537
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:31,443
I didn't recognize you.
You look, somehow, different.

538
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,089
- Scotch.
- Likewise.

539
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:45,295
I was surprised to hear from you.
Surprised and pleased, Miss...

540
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,359
Please, no names.

541
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:52,896
If it's all that private, I've got
a bottle in my room upstairs.

542
00:49:53,438 --> 00:49:55,799
This is a business meeting.

543
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:01,477
I find I have need of someone with
your talents and experience...

544
00:50:01,913 --> 00:50:03,842
Please, no names!

545
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,585
You interested in a big-time caper?

546
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:10,851
- A what?
- A heist.

547
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:13,780
You mean a burglary.

548
00:50:25,103 --> 00:50:27,328
What's the score, baby?

549
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,941
Won't be easy.

550
00:50:30,942 --> 00:50:34,009
That's okay.
What's the job? I'm in.

551
00:50:34,746 --> 00:50:37,744
- The Klיber-Lafayette Museum.
- I'm out!

552
00:50:39,284 --> 00:50:41,714
Why that particular spot?

553
00:50:44,122 --> 00:50:46,119
The Cellini Venus.

554
00:50:47,258 --> 00:50:49,221
Your Cellini Venus?

555
00:50:49,527 --> 00:50:52,462
Well, it's not mine exactly.
It's sort of in the family.

556
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:55,131
Anyway, that should be
no concern of yours.

557
00:50:55,867 --> 00:50:57,932
You want to steal it?

558
00:50:58,436 --> 00:50:59,796
Why?

559
00:51:02,106 --> 00:51:03,967
Is it a publicity stunt?

560
00:51:04,008 --> 00:51:07,911
Lord, no! It's very valuable.
It's worth $1,000,000!

561
00:51:07,912 --> 00:51:11,415
I know. There are also 1,000,000
policemen prowling around it.

562
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:15,643
That's about a dollar a policeman.
I don't like the rate of exchange.

563
00:51:16,254 --> 00:51:18,786
- You mean you won't do it?
- No.

564
00:51:19,591 --> 00:51:21,658
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure.

565
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:23,224
I'm sorry.

566
00:51:23,628 --> 00:51:25,728
Thank you for thinking of me.

567
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:28,656
Look, finish your drink.

568
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,963
I have to go.

569
00:51:31,302 --> 00:51:33,026
Are you really serious?

570
00:51:33,338 --> 00:51:36,139
You've seen the way your
statue is protected.

571
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,041
The Electric Eye, the guards....

572
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:41,541
Well, I was hoping to leave
those details to you.

573
00:51:44,015 --> 00:51:46,240
I'll sleep on it and....

574
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:48,318
It's too late, the museum's closed.

575
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,387
We'll look over the
premises in the morning.

576
00:51:50,388 --> 00:51:53,580
What we call in the trade
"casing the joint."

577
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:58,294
Thank you very much.

578
00:51:58,696 --> 00:52:02,457
Look, it's early. Why don't
I show you the real Paris.

579
00:52:02,867 --> 00:52:04,796
That's very kind of you.

580
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:06,937
I live here. I was born in Paris.

581
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:10,301
I forgot. Why don't you
show me the real Paris?

582
00:52:10,408 --> 00:52:14,442
- I only have two inches left of this bench.
- I'm terribly sorry.

583
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:17,012
Where and what time tomorrow?

584
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:22,386
I find that the most successful
jobs of this kind are planned...

585
00:52:22,387 --> 00:52:27,149
when everyone is relaxed. So let's meet
and have a nice, long, cozy lunch.

586
00:52:29,227 --> 00:52:32,162
Corner of avenue Gabriel,
avenue Marigny, 10:00 a.m.

587
00:52:32,163 --> 00:52:33,830
- Right?
- Right.

588
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:03,193
Is it those police
that worry you so?

589
00:53:03,194 --> 00:53:05,862
Yes. And these.

590
00:53:07,031 --> 00:53:10,758
But that's the Ministry of the
Interior. It's always guarded.

591
00:53:11,169 --> 00:53:13,030
What about them?

592
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:19,137
They don't have anything to do with us.
They're guarding government buildings.

593
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:23,236
That's where the President lives.

594
00:53:23,715 --> 00:53:25,212
I know.

595
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:30,581
And the museum you want to
stick up is right here.

596
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:32,255
Very handy!

597
00:53:32,256 --> 00:53:35,448
I can practically taste
the bread and water!

598
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,611
- It can't be!
- What?

599
00:54:30,848 --> 00:54:34,415
Well, for a moment, I thought
I saw a resemblance.

600
00:54:35,553 --> 00:54:37,243
Resemblance to what?

601
00:54:37,422 --> 00:54:39,055
You and....

602
00:54:39,757 --> 00:54:42,926
That's silly! She's at
least 400 years old.

603
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:44,719
I know, but....

604
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:49,728
Sorry.

605
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:55,038
Where exactly were you in the
early part of the 16th century?

606
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,402
I don't know, but that's
not how I was dressed.

607
00:57:13,678 --> 00:57:15,178
Who's in charge here?

608
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:17,747
Sir! At your service!

609
00:57:17,748 --> 00:57:21,782
Dubois, Assistant Deputy Chairman,
Commissioner of Tourism.

610
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,721
Isn't this place cleaned regularly?

611
00:57:24,722 --> 00:57:28,091
Look at this sleeve, just from
brushing against the woodwork.

612
00:57:28,092 --> 00:57:31,094
I'm sorry, but we have a complete
staff of cleaning women.

613
00:57:31,095 --> 00:57:32,529
Once a month, I suppose.

614
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:35,460
No, sir, every night, from
midnight until 4:00 a.m.

615
00:57:37,468 --> 00:57:40,604
See they do their jobs properly,
or I'll make a report.

616
00:57:40,605 --> 00:57:42,170
Yes, sir.

617
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:44,665
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

618
00:57:45,876 --> 00:57:47,100
Sir!

619
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,943
- This way.
- Really?

620
00:58:26,684 --> 00:58:31,021
Don't you think it's being a bit pushy,
starting with a million-dollar robbery?

621
00:58:31,022 --> 00:58:33,790
I mean, we've got to walk
before we can run, you know.

622
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:36,159
I know a little gallery
we could knock over...

623
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,895
just to get our feet wet
so to speak and then...

624
00:58:38,896 --> 00:58:43,192
gathering confidence as we go,
we could move into the big time.

625
00:58:44,869 --> 00:58:47,537
- No good?
- No good at all.

626
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,464
Next question.

627
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,802
Why must it be this
particular work of art?

628
00:58:56,213 --> 00:59:00,315
Well, you don't think I'd steal something
that didn't belong to me, do you?

629
00:59:02,553 --> 00:59:05,347
Excuse me, I spoke
without thinking.

630
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:09,856
Why not wait until you get it
back home and steal it then?

631
00:59:09,894 --> 00:59:13,962
No muss, no fuss,
a nice, clean inside job.

632
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:17,801
- I'll be delighted to offer my services.
- This is not a prank or a whim.

633
00:59:17,802 --> 00:59:20,197
It's something I must do...

634
00:59:20,471 --> 00:59:23,003
- because I must do it.
- I see.

635
00:59:34,552 --> 00:59:37,084
We must look at the
facts impartially.

636
00:59:37,455 --> 00:59:40,089
We can't get past
the alarm. That's out.

637
00:59:40,124 --> 00:59:42,325
We can't tamper
with it. That's out.

638
00:59:42,326 --> 00:59:45,017
- We can't turn it off.
- That's out.

639
00:59:45,229 --> 00:59:47,727
You're some burglar, you are.

640
01:00:00,578 --> 01:00:03,406
This is how you normally
work, by the mile?

641
01:00:03,514 --> 01:00:07,582
I'm thinking. Look at my
forehead, all wrinkled.

642
01:00:07,785 --> 01:00:11,020
What we need is at precisely
the right moment...

643
01:00:11,021 --> 01:00:13,223
some trusted member of
the museum staff...

644
01:00:13,224 --> 01:00:15,525
has to obligingly switch
off the alarm system.

645
01:00:15,526 --> 01:00:18,128
- Couldn't we bribe someone?
- Excellent idea!

646
01:00:18,129 --> 01:00:19,887
- No.
- Why not?

647
01:00:20,865 --> 01:00:24,592
Because I don't know which
guard knows how to do it.

648
01:00:24,668 --> 01:00:27,370
Do you want to see it again?
All right. Here we go.

649
01:00:27,371 --> 01:00:31,302
It always circles around and
comes back. Just like that.

650
01:00:32,676 --> 01:00:34,571
Not now, please!

651
01:00:34,578 --> 01:00:38,081
There you are, sonny. It's all ready.
Thank you very much.

652
01:00:38,082 --> 01:00:41,918
- You, sir. How many do you want?
- Excuse me, gentlemen. I was here first.

653
01:00:41,919 --> 01:00:43,833
Excuse me, sir. Ever
seen the boomerang?

654
01:00:43,834 --> 01:00:45,789
- Two?
- Blue or red?

655
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:50,460
Don't forget what I told the children. Don't
forget to throw it at the right angle.

656
01:00:50,461 --> 01:00:52,322
That's the idea.

657
01:00:58,936 --> 01:01:01,263
Great fun! Try it.

658
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:06,468
If you'll tell me what
you're doing and why...

659
01:01:06,844 --> 01:01:10,207
I'll buy you a cowboy
suit and a set of trains.

660
01:01:10,614 --> 01:01:14,884
I want you to take a long last look
at the blue sky, the green grass...

661
01:01:14,885 --> 01:01:17,954
the trees and the river, all of
which I loathe personally...

662
01:01:17,955 --> 01:01:20,790
which is why a juicy stretch
in a cozy French prison...

663
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:23,050
doesn't bother me at all.

664
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,519
You think you have a
scheme that might work?

665
01:01:30,835 --> 01:01:33,403
You really are the smuggest
and most hateful man.

666
01:01:33,404 --> 01:01:37,370
If you frequent criminal
circles, you can't be choosey.

667
01:01:40,277 --> 01:01:43,605
How do you like being a
gangster's moll, baby?

668
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:47,240
Now where are we going?

669
01:01:47,718 --> 01:01:49,442
My apartment.

670
01:01:51,455 --> 01:01:55,892
I'd like to remind you, Mr. Dermott,
ours is a business relationship.

671
01:01:55,893 --> 01:01:59,896
I am aware of that. I'm also aware
of the social gulf between us.

672
01:01:59,897 --> 01:02:03,430
You are an aristocrat, and
I am a humble burglar.

673
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:23,478
Right. There's the bathroom.
Take off your clothes.

674
01:02:24,388 --> 01:02:27,056
Are we planning the
same sort of crime?

675
01:02:27,057 --> 01:02:29,325
You are quite safe.
It's dress-rehearsal time.

676
01:02:29,326 --> 01:02:32,723
That's why we bought all
this lovely junk. Come on.

677
01:02:33,163 --> 01:02:35,923
If it's a necessary
part of the plan....

678
01:02:36,133 --> 01:02:37,333
Are you sure?

679
01:02:37,334 --> 01:02:40,731
Chatter, chatter, chatter.
Do as you're told!

680
01:03:38,696 --> 01:03:41,057
That's nice.

681
01:03:41,398 --> 01:03:44,897
Yes, that's really nice.

682
01:03:45,302 --> 01:03:48,437
It just needs one
more little touch.

683
01:03:52,743 --> 01:03:55,605
Now turn around for me,
would you? Go on.

684
01:03:56,547 --> 01:03:59,113
Yes, that's fine. That does it.

685
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:00,883
Does what?

686
01:04:00,884 --> 01:04:04,713
For one thing, it gives
Givenchy a night off. Now....

687
01:04:10,427 --> 01:04:11,616
Down!

688
01:04:16,867 --> 01:04:19,058
Scrub the floor.

689
01:04:19,303 --> 01:04:21,334
Crime doesn't pay, does it.

690
01:04:21,405 --> 01:04:25,302
Elbow grease! Scrub!
And don't sulk.

691
01:04:25,376 --> 01:04:28,611
At 11:57 p.m., all hell will
break loose in the museum.

692
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:31,414
And at midnight, the
scrubwomen come trooping in.

693
01:04:31,415 --> 01:04:34,277
And whatever happens,
hang onto your bucket.

694
01:04:35,753 --> 01:04:37,653
You do have a plan, don't you?

695
01:04:37,654 --> 01:04:41,051
Of course I have.
Now listen very carefully.

696
01:04:41,825 --> 01:04:44,327
My plan is, on the
night of the crime...

697
01:04:44,328 --> 01:04:48,157
my plan and I will be curled up
in that bed with a good book.

698
01:04:52,136 --> 01:04:55,338
- Why?
- You asked me why? I ask you why.

699
01:04:55,339 --> 01:04:57,840
Why are we breaking into a
heavily guarded museum...

700
01:04:57,841 --> 01:05:00,710
to steal a precious statue
which belongs to you?

701
01:05:00,711 --> 01:05:04,278
But I told you why I
couldn't tell you why.

702
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:07,777
Not good enough.

703
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,256
You're perfectly right. In your
place, I'd feel the same way.

704
01:05:13,257 --> 01:05:15,584
I'm in this awful trouble.

705
01:05:15,993 --> 01:05:18,593
But it's nothing to do with you.

706
01:05:18,929 --> 01:05:20,960
I just can't explain so I'm stuck.

707
01:05:21,498 --> 01:05:23,499
I'll get out of these clothes.

708
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,869
- Don't you dare cry!
- I have something in my eye.

709
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:29,972
There's nothing wrong with it.
You're crying to soften me up.

710
01:05:29,973 --> 01:05:33,301
- It's not true.
- It won't work! I'm too tough.

711
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:36,345
I know. I'm going.

712
01:05:37,247 --> 01:05:38,778
Hurry up!

713
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:42,844
Go on. Hurry up!

714
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:53,155
And meet me at the museum
at 5:30 p.m., sharp.

715
01:05:57,734 --> 01:06:01,028
And don't ask me why, or
I'll hit you with a bucket!

716
01:06:01,505 --> 01:06:05,300
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir!

717
01:06:15,752 --> 01:06:20,189
I won't be in for dinner, Marcel, and
I may be out quite late, in fact.

718
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:22,091
If anybody calls, anyone at all...

719
01:06:22,092 --> 01:06:24,560
you don't know where I
am, or how to reach me.

720
01:06:24,561 --> 01:06:26,490
Yes, <i>mademoiselle</i>.

721
01:06:34,471 --> 01:06:36,161
Good afternoon.

722
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,641
Just tell Miss Bonnet
that I'm here, please?

723
01:06:38,642 --> 01:06:41,310
I'm sorry, sir. Miss
Bonnet has gone out.

724
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:44,447
Out? Are you sure? Her
car is in the courtyard.

725
01:06:44,448 --> 01:06:47,139
Quite sure, sir. She took a taxi.

726
01:06:48,585 --> 01:06:50,650
Well, I'll wait.

727
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,867
Why, hello....

728
01:07:05,335 --> 01:07:07,332
What a nice surprise!

729
01:07:07,638 --> 01:07:10,706
I did go out. I forgot
something, so I came in again.

730
01:07:10,707 --> 01:07:12,241
The servants' entrance.

731
01:07:12,242 --> 01:07:15,775
I'm rushing out again. Thank you.
I'll let Mr. Leland out.

732
01:07:15,913 --> 01:07:18,848
No. I'm all rehearsed, made
up, and ready to go on.

733
01:07:18,849 --> 01:07:20,716
Luckily it's only a short speech.

734
01:07:20,717 --> 01:07:23,853
I must fly. I have a business
appointment. I can't be late...

735
01:07:23,854 --> 01:07:27,217
Business! That's all you
French girls ever think about.

736
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:30,259
- Well, a minute, a second, really.
- You're in a rush.

737
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:33,327
You want action? Fine!
That's my mood, too.

738
01:07:33,697 --> 01:07:35,330
Here. Catch.

739
01:07:39,203 --> 01:07:41,803
- Oh, Davis!
- Please, no speeches.

740
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:43,272
But why?

741
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:46,567
Why? That's the silliest
question I ever heard of.

742
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,811
It's wild. We don't
even know each other.

743
01:07:48,812 --> 01:07:52,081
- Please come back tomorrow?
- No. Made up my mind. Man of action!

744
01:07:52,082 --> 01:07:54,784
Snap judgment. I bought a
fleet of tankers that way.

745
01:07:54,785 --> 01:07:58,487
- One of the best deals I ever made.
- But I'm not a fleet of tankers.

746
01:07:58,488 --> 01:08:00,923
I'm not getting engaged
to a man I barely know.

747
01:08:00,924 --> 01:08:04,794
You'll get to know me. Look me up
in Who's Who, Dun & Bradstreet...

748
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:07,327
There. That's it. It's a deal?

749
01:08:07,464 --> 01:08:10,199
Yes. But, no! I'm a little dizzy.

750
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,670
And this thing is just blinding me!
I really have to run.

751
01:08:14,671 --> 01:08:16,105
- No. Relax.
- I do.

752
01:08:16,106 --> 01:08:19,673
I've never been engaged
to such a fidgety girl in all my life.

753
01:08:20,077 --> 01:08:21,767
The kiss.

754
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:46,640
- Where have you been?
- I was getting engaged.

755
01:08:47,584 --> 01:08:49,051
Come on.

756
01:08:49,052 --> 01:08:51,887
This fellow came when I was leaving.
He wants to marry me.

757
01:08:51,888 --> 01:08:54,790
I didn't want to keep you
waiting, so I got engaged to him.

758
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:57,394
- Is it all right? Am I on time?
- Fine.

759
01:08:57,395 --> 01:08:59,329
In fact, we have 10 more minutes.

760
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:02,658
- If you'd like to go back and marry him...
- Come on.

761
01:09:11,175 --> 01:09:14,004
Would you check your
parcel, please?

762
01:09:46,213 --> 01:09:47,778
Thank you.

763
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,539
Just checking on the
accommodations.

764
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:35,464
Don't start that. Not again.

765
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:37,566
I could swear that....

766
01:10:44,842 --> 01:10:47,704
Well, we have a few moments
for cultural improvement.

767
01:10:49,747 --> 01:10:51,549
How do we get past the alarm?

768
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:53,685
Like this gentlemen here...

769
01:10:53,686 --> 01:10:57,219
I'm depending on normal
human reactions.

770
01:10:58,257 --> 01:10:59,924
Blue period?

771
01:11:02,461 --> 01:11:04,929
Regard the subtle harmony of color.

772
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:09,465
Now, the nice thing about complicated
mechanical devices is...

773
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:12,502
if they do suddenly go haywire....

774
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:16,404
Yes. What's after haywire?

775
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:19,244
Well, the people in charge
have a tendency to panic...

776
01:11:19,245 --> 01:11:24,383
and to run around in confused circles,
and at that moment we strike.

777
01:11:25,353 --> 01:11:27,453
A superb Rembrandt.

778
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:32,484
Now, this is, to coin a phrase,
the point of no return.

779
01:11:32,493 --> 01:11:36,152
In precisely one minute,
the closing bell will ring.

780
01:11:36,598 --> 01:11:41,326
We can leave with the others
and have a quiet dinner, or we stay.

781
01:11:41,603 --> 01:11:43,838
Then we're committed
to go through with it.

782
01:11:43,839 --> 01:11:46,530
Do you really want it...

783
01:11:47,209 --> 01:11:48,535
that much?

784
01:11:49,145 --> 01:11:50,573
More!

785
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,616
Okay. You're the boss.
Just do as I tell you.

786
01:12:18,476 --> 01:12:20,837
Stand by for the countdown.

787
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:25,340
Six, five, four...

788
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:29,451
three, two, one....

789
01:12:31,624 --> 01:12:32,950
Now!

790
01:13:17,706 --> 01:13:20,272
Watch for normal human reactions.

791
01:14:41,296 --> 01:14:42,724
Comfy?

792
01:14:44,065 --> 01:14:48,429
I hadn't counted on there being
quite so much togetherness.

793
01:14:49,237 --> 01:14:52,406
It's the height of the tourist season.
Everything was booked.

794
01:14:52,407 --> 01:14:54,404
This was the best I could do.

795
01:15:59,612 --> 01:16:02,581
He locked the door.
He's locked us in.

796
01:16:02,582 --> 01:16:06,651
It's challenging, I admit,
but doesn't that make it more interesting?

797
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:12,617
- I'm going to faint.
- Don't. There's no room.

798
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:52,130
All right, boys.

799
01:16:57,007 --> 01:16:59,232
Didn't you hear me?

800
01:18:54,499 --> 01:18:56,860
8:01 on the nose.

801
01:18:57,135 --> 01:18:59,537
Now we have a fix
on when they make their rounds.

802
01:18:59,538 --> 01:19:01,535
Exactly every hour.

803
01:19:03,776 --> 01:19:07,275
We're still locked in. How
about that, mastermind?

804
01:20:19,557 --> 01:20:21,156
Hold that.

805
01:21:31,634 --> 01:21:33,267
Brilliant!

806
01:21:43,213 --> 01:21:46,405
- It doesn't open from the inside.
- Blast!

807
01:21:47,584 --> 01:21:51,186
However, by a strange
coincidence...

808
01:21:52,089 --> 01:21:54,348
I just happen to have....

809
01:23:48,714 --> 01:23:50,176
Now.

810
01:23:54,653 --> 01:23:56,252
Marvelous.

811
01:23:57,055 --> 01:23:58,746
No applause, please.

812
01:23:58,858 --> 01:24:01,618
Wait till you see what
I do for an encore.

813
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:08,027
What are you doing?

814
01:25:08,635 --> 01:25:12,135
Give it to me. Here.

815
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:22,875
Put those on. Get cracking.

816
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:40,594
Turn around.

817
01:25:41,571 --> 01:25:43,033
What for?

818
01:25:45,141 --> 01:25:47,832
They go on over the clothes.

819
01:25:55,586 --> 01:25:57,481
There. Thank you.

820
01:26:07,632 --> 01:26:10,232
Congratulations! You look terrible.

821
01:26:10,235 --> 01:26:12,470
Can we steal that statue soon?

822
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:16,402
- I hate to complain but really...
- Have patience. We will.

823
01:26:16,975 --> 01:26:19,541
When? And how?

824
01:26:20,045 --> 01:26:22,874
Now look, if you were a guard...

825
01:26:23,316 --> 01:26:26,852
and had to sit night after night
guarding junk you couldn't afford...

826
01:26:26,853 --> 01:26:29,421
and didn't particularly
like, how would you feel?

827
01:26:29,422 --> 01:26:31,021
Irritable.

828
01:26:37,031 --> 01:26:39,222
Oh, no!

829
01:26:39,933 --> 01:26:43,398
- It's psychological warfare.
- With that?

830
01:27:45,002 --> 01:27:47,694
Turn on the lights. Follow me!

831
01:27:49,975 --> 01:27:52,040
"Ring out, wild bells!"

832
01:28:00,487 --> 01:28:04,316
Look around! You spread out!
Come with me.

833
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:30,280
Everything is in order.

834
01:29:30,416 --> 01:29:34,052
- Nothing is missing.
- I checked. It isn't a short circuit.

835
01:29:34,186 --> 01:29:35,614
Scientists!

836
01:29:36,522 --> 01:29:40,284
A burglar alarm especially
designed to give me heartburn.

837
01:29:43,396 --> 01:29:45,564
- Sorry, sir.
- Thank you.

838
01:30:04,318 --> 01:30:07,510
Klיber-Lafayette Museum.
Senior Guard speaking.

839
01:30:10,292 --> 01:30:13,794
I regret very much if the Minister
and the Madam Minister...

840
01:30:13,795 --> 01:30:15,860
have been disturbed.

841
01:30:17,032 --> 01:30:19,860
Yes, I know it's a very loud alarm.

842
01:30:20,669 --> 01:30:22,470
We don't know why it went off.

843
01:30:22,471 --> 01:30:25,505
We checked everything, and
so did the police. But....

844
01:30:25,608 --> 01:30:29,039
No, sir, nothing is missing,
and the alarms are set again.

845
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,477
I'm sorry, sir. Good night, sir.

846
01:30:33,483 --> 01:30:35,017
The Prefecture of Police.

847
01:30:35,018 --> 01:30:38,416
The alarm bells woke up the
Minister of the Interior.

848
01:30:38,622 --> 01:30:39,914
Good!

849
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:56,973
I'm so scared.

850
01:30:57,509 --> 01:30:59,370
My heart's thumping.

851
01:30:59,411 --> 01:31:01,272
I just feel terrible.

852
01:31:01,446 --> 01:31:05,249
I'd send for a doctor but I honestly
don't think he'd fit in the closet.

853
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:09,911
I'm so scared for you, too. I had
no right to involve you in this.

854
01:31:10,056 --> 01:31:12,090
And if you want to
call it off, I....

855
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:16,250
Well, that's a kind thought and
I appreciate it, but then....

856
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:20,262
What about Prof. Bauer?

857
01:31:21,501 --> 01:31:25,762
What happens tomorrow when he turns
up to test your million-dollar baby?

858
01:31:29,276 --> 01:31:31,376
It's a fake, isn't it?

859
01:31:33,447 --> 01:31:36,116
No long, involved stories
at this time of night.

860
01:31:36,117 --> 01:31:38,649
Just nod your head, yes or no.

861
01:31:46,594 --> 01:31:48,318
Who carved it?

862
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,736
- My grandfather.
- Who posed for it?

863
01:31:57,873 --> 01:31:59,631
My grandmother.

864
01:32:01,777 --> 01:32:06,210
- You're the first to notice a resemblance.
- I'm very sensitive and perceptive.

865
01:32:07,684 --> 01:32:10,819
How long have you known
about her, and me, and....

866
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:13,716
Since you first asked
me to steal it.

867
01:32:16,092 --> 01:32:19,262
But then if you knew the
Venus was worthless...

868
01:32:19,263 --> 01:32:21,021
why did you....

869
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,842
That's why.

870
01:32:35,046 --> 01:32:37,180
I'm so stupid.

871
01:32:40,919 --> 01:32:43,110
Explain it to me again.

872
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:07,073
Funny how roomy it's
suddenly become in here.

873
01:33:07,314 --> 01:33:10,005
We're adjusting to our environment.

874
01:33:11,652 --> 01:33:12,785
What is it?

875
01:33:12,786 --> 01:33:16,582
I'm sorry. It's my engagement
ring. I forgot about it.

876
01:33:16,658 --> 01:33:18,985
So did I. Congratulations.

877
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:21,652
May I kiss the bride?

878
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:28,361
For one thing,
whose bride am I kissing?

879
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:34,405
I don't know. Some American.
His name's Leland Davis.

880
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:37,178
Or Davis Leland?

881
01:33:37,179 --> 01:33:40,007
They're lucky fellows,
both of them.

882
01:33:42,184 --> 01:33:44,512
Second round coming up.

883
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:46,982
Just marking my place.

884
01:33:48,658 --> 01:33:50,621
Don't go away.

885
01:34:34,007 --> 01:34:36,198
Find him! Look around.

886
01:35:20,856 --> 01:35:25,255
Pretty soon, someone's going to
get awfully tired of this racket.

887
01:35:28,231 --> 01:35:30,365
Normal human reaction.

888
01:36:09,109 --> 01:36:12,642
Jacquart speaking, Senior Guard
at the Klיber-Lafayette Museum.

889
01:36:15,315 --> 01:36:17,380
At your service, Excellency!

890
01:36:18,785 --> 01:36:22,389
Yes, sir, I know it makes a
terrible noise, Excellency.

891
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:24,922
It was installed for
just that purpose.

892
01:36:25,292 --> 01:36:28,552
No, Excellency,
I didn't install it.

893
01:36:30,197 --> 01:36:33,332
Yes, sir, I know it is
the second time tonight.

894
01:36:33,634 --> 01:36:37,532
It will be rectified right away.
Good night, Excellency.

895
01:36:41,043 --> 01:36:43,370
Now guess who we woke up?

896
01:36:47,582 --> 01:36:49,410
Switch off the lights.

897
01:36:50,887 --> 01:36:52,679
I'm going to turn it off!

898
01:36:53,823 --> 01:36:55,217
Permanently!

899
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:11,773
It worked.

900
01:37:12,543 --> 01:37:16,179
What do you know.
They've turned off the A-B....

901
01:37:18,383 --> 01:37:21,643
- It worked!
- Didn't you expect it to?

902
01:37:23,922 --> 01:37:28,752
- Pull yourself together. You're a genius.
- I know. It's a funny feeling.

903
01:37:30,161 --> 01:37:35,163
Look, wait until the moment
of maximum confusion...

904
01:37:35,534 --> 01:37:39,830
and then start scrubbing like mad in
the direction of the guards' room.

905
01:37:40,039 --> 01:37:41,940
- Guards' room?
- That's right.

906
01:37:41,941 --> 01:37:43,699
But the guards!

907
01:37:43,943 --> 01:37:47,646
When they see that the Venus is gone
there will be guards everywhere...

908
01:37:47,647 --> 01:37:49,872
except the guards' room.

909
01:37:51,852 --> 01:37:53,986
- Shall we?
- Thank you.

910
01:38:19,381 --> 01:38:20,980
Come here.

911
01:38:30,393 --> 01:38:31,992
Hang on to your bucket.

912
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:41,636
Stay here.

913
01:39:25,351 --> 01:39:27,349
You there, Nicole?

914
01:39:28,422 --> 01:39:30,214
Get back there.

915
01:39:42,604 --> 01:39:45,602
You know, Grandpa was pretty good.

916
01:39:46,474 --> 01:39:48,369
To say nothing of Grandma.

917
01:39:54,015 --> 01:39:57,845
Now, in the chimney with you,
till the scrubwomen come.

918
01:40:03,325 --> 01:40:04,958
Good luck.

919
01:41:51,808 --> 01:41:53,976
What a night we've had!

920
01:41:53,977 --> 01:41:57,913
One alarm after another. And
telephone calls from everybody.

921
01:41:57,914 --> 01:42:00,947
Who do you think called
from across the street?

922
01:42:32,652 --> 01:42:35,980
Don't just stand there gaping.
Get to your post, man!

923
01:42:38,091 --> 01:42:40,555
And don't hesitate
when I give an order!

924
01:42:54,375 --> 01:42:56,236
Alarm!

925
01:43:03,452 --> 01:43:05,142
Robbers! Crooks!

926
01:45:00,577 --> 01:45:03,143
Get this silly bottle out of here!

927
01:45:50,730 --> 01:45:53,633
Can you give us a brief history
of the Venus, Mr. Bonnet?

928
01:45:53,634 --> 01:45:55,635
Have the police reported
any progress yet?

929
01:45:55,636 --> 01:45:57,303
Did you turn down
$1,000,000 for it?

930
01:45:57,304 --> 01:45:59,372
How did you learn
about the robbery?

931
01:45:59,373 --> 01:46:02,808
I woke up in the night
with a sudden premonition.

932
01:46:02,809 --> 01:46:04,810
I thought it was
something I'd eaten.

933
01:46:04,811 --> 01:46:07,414
But Mr. Grammont,
the director of the museum...

934
01:46:07,415 --> 01:46:09,850
he called and I believe
he's on his way here.

935
01:46:09,851 --> 01:46:12,519
Are you offering a reward
for the return of the Venus?

936
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:14,988
No! What I mean to say is...

937
01:46:14,989 --> 01:46:19,455
that it seems so commercial
to think of money at a time like this.

938
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:25,700
I just heard the news. I can't
believe my ears or my eyes.

939
01:46:25,701 --> 01:46:28,803
Absolutely fantastic!
To pull off a thing like that!

940
01:46:28,804 --> 01:46:31,172
I guarantee that the
police are investigating.

941
01:46:31,173 --> 01:46:35,277
The police? Man, where's your spirit?
If we wait for the police...

942
01:46:35,278 --> 01:46:39,014
the Venus will be out of the country!
We'll never set eyes on it again.

943
01:46:39,015 --> 01:46:43,519
De Solnay, I'm still vitally interested
in the Cellini Venus, hot or cold.

944
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,688
Do you know what I mean by that?

945
01:46:45,689 --> 01:46:50,259
Leland! Do you know what you're saying?
You're compounding a felony.

946
01:46:50,494 --> 01:46:54,255
Offering to become a
receiver of stolen goods.

947
01:46:54,265 --> 01:46:56,228
I'm an art lover.

948
01:46:56,567 --> 01:47:01,571
As a public service, I want to make an
independent inquiry to help the police.

949
01:47:01,572 --> 01:47:03,039
Is that a crime?

950
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,609
And if you find it, a
step ahead of the police?

951
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:07,411
You let me worry about that.

952
01:47:07,412 --> 01:47:11,605
- No, I'm an art dealer, not a fence.
- A fence?

953
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:16,614
I'll do it entirely on my own.
All I need is an opening contact.

954
01:47:16,755 --> 01:47:20,016
- De Solnay? All right.
- Wait!

955
01:47:21,661 --> 01:47:24,296
There happens to be a man
in Paris at the moment...

956
01:47:24,297 --> 01:47:26,965
who specializes in
matters of fine art.

957
01:47:26,999 --> 01:47:31,659
His name is.... No, Leland, please!
Think of what you're trying to do.

958
01:47:31,805 --> 01:47:35,074
- What about Nicole Bonnet?
- I want both. Nicole and the Venus.

959
01:47:35,075 --> 01:47:37,810
Leland, remember? I sold
you your first painting.

960
01:47:37,811 --> 01:47:40,546
I made you a collector.
I thought it'd help you relax.

961
01:47:40,547 --> 01:47:43,683
It's great! I've never been
so relaxed in all my life!

962
01:47:43,684 --> 01:47:46,387
- Yes, I can see that.
- All right. The name!

963
01:47:46,388 --> 01:47:49,356
The name is Simon Dermott.
He is staying at the Ritz.

964
01:47:49,357 --> 01:47:52,549
Night Fighter calling Dawn Patrol.

965
01:47:52,694 --> 01:47:56,563
<i>Our telephone may be tapped, so we will
conduct this conversation in Swahili.</i>

966
01:47:56,564 --> 01:47:57,924
How are you?

967
01:47:58,733 --> 01:48:00,335
Did you sleep well?

968
01:48:00,336 --> 01:48:03,699
Simon, isn't it too awful?
I slept beautifully!

969
01:48:03,706 --> 01:48:07,535
And I've just eaten an enormous
breakfast. Isn't it ghastly?

970
01:48:07,843 --> 01:48:10,068
It's your tainted blood.

971
01:48:10,746 --> 01:48:12,470
Who? What?

972
01:48:12,781 --> 01:48:17,420
She's fine. She's wrapped up in one
of my old shirts, just as snug as can be.

973
01:48:17,421 --> 01:48:19,622
I rocked her to sleep
in my arms last night.

974
01:48:19,623 --> 01:48:22,587
It's the first time I ever
did that with a grandmother.

975
01:48:41,412 --> 01:48:44,138
Simon, do you think we
should be seen together?

976
01:48:48,353 --> 01:48:51,317
All right. In an hour
at the Ritz bar.

977
01:48:55,627 --> 01:48:58,228
The Cellini Venus was uninsured.

978
01:48:58,498 --> 01:49:00,359
- Uninsured?
- Yes.

979
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,231
But I vaguely recollect signing
something for insurance.

980
01:49:05,104 --> 01:49:07,840
But the policy was
not yet in force.

981
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:10,874
Not until the technical
examination had been made.

982
01:49:11,611 --> 01:49:14,080
Yes, the technical examination.

983
01:49:14,081 --> 01:49:17,050
Well, $1,000,000 more,
$1,000,000 less.

984
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:20,220
I believe my father did buy it
at a bargain price.

985
01:49:20,221 --> 01:49:23,185
My dear sir, you are a prince.

986
01:49:24,058 --> 01:49:27,751
I wish I could express
properly what I feel.

987
01:49:28,230 --> 01:49:32,230
Prof. Bauer, I dare say,
will be greatly disappointed.

988
01:49:32,601 --> 01:49:34,935
Yes, and I must meet him now.

989
01:49:34,936 --> 01:49:39,940
Give him my regards, and say I'm sorry to
have been unable to see him on this trip.

990
01:49:39,941 --> 01:49:44,602
Now cheer up, my dear fellow. It's
not the end of the world, you know.

991
01:49:51,754 --> 01:49:53,444
Marcel, champagne!

992
01:49:57,127 --> 01:49:59,896
- Where are you?
- I'm here. We're saved!

993
01:49:59,897 --> 01:50:02,798
- Isn't it marvelous?
- My darling!

994
01:50:02,799 --> 01:50:05,902
- Thank heaven for the criminal class.
- I'm so happy.

995
01:50:05,903 --> 01:50:09,806
You don't have to go to jail. I don't have
to go to America. It's beautiful!

996
01:50:09,807 --> 01:50:12,643
We must celebrate! Marcel,
take it into the library.

997
01:50:12,644 --> 01:50:17,548
We'll have a lunch and again tonight,
fireworks, cocktails, a magnificent dinner!

998
01:50:17,549 --> 01:50:21,018
But not right away. I have a very
important appointment at the Ritz.

999
01:50:21,019 --> 01:50:24,348
- But I'll be right back, I promise.
- That's good.

1000
01:50:24,356 --> 01:50:26,421
I'll start by myself.

1001
01:50:30,195 --> 01:50:32,727
The Ritz? Again?

1002
01:50:48,415 --> 01:50:52,686
You realize what you're asking is
extremely difficult and dangerous?

1003
01:50:52,687 --> 01:50:56,122
- Yes, I know that, Mr. Dermott.
- Please, no names.

1004
01:50:56,123 --> 01:50:59,781
We may be up against some
very desperate characters.

1005
01:51:01,262 --> 01:51:02,986
- Them?
- Those.

1006
01:51:03,564 --> 01:51:06,434
Fortunately, I've a few contacts.
In fact, this morning...

1007
01:51:06,435 --> 01:51:10,471
I made a few inquiries, you know, put
out a few feelers. Just idle curiosity.

1008
01:51:10,472 --> 01:51:13,240
- You've got a lead?
- Too early for anything concrete.

1009
01:51:13,241 --> 01:51:16,342
Let's just say I suspect
who was involved.

1010
01:51:16,445 --> 01:51:21,049
Ls it, you know, what we're talking
about, is it still in France?

1011
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:26,017
I think so. I think I can definitely
state it's still in France.

1012
01:51:27,457 --> 01:51:30,759
You realize you might be paying
a great deal of money...

1013
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:34,296
for something you could never exhibit,
acknowledge, or even display...

1014
01:51:34,297 --> 01:51:37,467
- not even in your house?
- Yes, I know. I want it!

1015
01:51:37,468 --> 01:51:42,538
I just want to take it out of the vault,
all alone, just look at it now and then.

1016
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:46,470
Know that it's mine, that I
own it, that I can touch it.

1017
01:51:48,045 --> 01:51:49,546
One more thing.

1018
01:51:49,547 --> 01:51:53,484
Do you happen to know the owners,
any member of the Bonnet family?

1019
01:51:53,485 --> 01:51:56,186
I've met Bonnet.
I know his daughter, too.

1020
01:51:56,187 --> 01:51:58,878
As a matter of fact, I'm
going to see her tonight.

1021
01:52:00,258 --> 01:52:03,561
Drop her! Don't see her. Don't
even telephone her. That's vital!

1022
01:52:03,562 --> 01:52:06,765
Any contact with any member of the
Bonnet family would be fatal.

1023
01:52:06,766 --> 01:52:10,561
- The criminals would suspect a trap.
- But we're engaged.

1024
01:52:12,071 --> 01:52:17,265
You know, you're a lucky fellow. From
what I hear, she's an enchanting girl.

1025
01:52:17,544 --> 01:52:20,713
What the hell! The world's full
of statues. Forget the Venus.

1026
01:52:20,714 --> 01:52:22,313
No! Listen!

1027
01:52:23,016 --> 01:52:26,447
I'll do anything you say.
I'll give you my word.

1028
01:52:30,957 --> 01:52:36,163
- I'll call you later in the day.
- All right. You'll contact me. Thanks.

1029
01:52:36,164 --> 01:52:39,128
- Sit tight. Wait for the call.
- Right.

1030
01:53:45,204 --> 01:53:47,770
- Do I look all right?
- Fine. Why?

1031
01:53:48,975 --> 01:53:53,077
I just met this fellow, and he treated
me like I was a leper or something.

1032
01:53:53,379 --> 01:53:55,547
I just wanted to
give him back this.

1033
01:53:55,548 --> 01:53:58,343
Really? Have a drink.
Good for morale.

1034
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:01,513
Let's have some
champagne to celebrate.

1035
01:54:01,622 --> 01:54:04,290
You can't celebrate a crime.
That's immoral.

1036
01:54:04,291 --> 01:54:08,027
- You handle it. It's too confusing.
- A bottle of Dom Perignon, please.

1037
01:54:08,028 --> 01:54:10,029
It's all right. You're
at the awkward age.

1038
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:13,700
Too old to be a juvenile delinquent,
too young to be a hardened criminal.

1039
01:54:13,701 --> 01:54:18,639
We did it! Did you see the papers and
the television? Did you hear the radio?

1040
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:23,072
It's the crime of the century,
practically. And we did it!

1041
01:54:24,078 --> 01:54:28,449
You were the brain behind it, but
I was of some help, wasn't I?

1042
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:31,853
I mean, we worked well together,
considering it was our first job.

1043
01:54:31,854 --> 01:54:34,222
- Calm down.
- I know I shouldn't carry on so...

1044
01:54:34,223 --> 01:54:37,425
it's all in a day's work for
you, but it's my first burglary.

1045
01:54:37,426 --> 01:54:40,117
- And mine, too.
- Bringing it off the way we....

1046
01:54:44,801 --> 01:54:46,161
What?

1047
01:54:48,038 --> 01:54:50,001
My first burglary.

1048
01:54:57,415 --> 01:55:00,413
Then what were you doing
in our house that night?

1049
01:55:00,785 --> 01:55:03,317
You're sure you want to know?

1050
01:55:10,362 --> 01:55:14,692
I'm a private detective, specializing
in stolen works of art...

1051
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:19,567
and in tracing, detecting,
and exposing forgeries.

1052
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:23,175
I am also an authority
on museum security...

1053
01:55:23,176 --> 01:55:25,844
being a special consultant
to principal museums...

1054
01:55:25,845 --> 01:55:29,448
in London, New York, Chicago,
Madrid. Even Leningrad.

1055
01:55:29,449 --> 01:55:32,451
I have degrees
in history of art and chemistry...

1056
01:55:32,452 --> 01:55:37,522
and a London University diploma, with
distinction, in advanced criminology.

1057
01:55:44,131 --> 01:55:46,094
You're all of that?

1058
01:55:48,569 --> 01:55:50,600
Then you're not a burglar?

1059
01:55:52,007 --> 01:55:55,743
I was chipping a piece of your
father's paint from that van Gogh...

1060
01:55:55,744 --> 01:55:59,471
when you loomed up in your
nighty and shot me in the arm.

1061
01:56:09,091 --> 01:56:11,657
- Bring another glass.
- Yes, sir.

1062
01:56:13,029 --> 01:56:16,198
I don't believe we've met.
My name is Charles Bonnet.

1063
01:56:16,599 --> 01:56:19,927
- May I please join you?
- Simon Dermott. By all means.

1064
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:24,307
Papa, this is a friend of mine. He's a....
I mean, he was telling me....

1065
01:56:24,308 --> 01:56:28,604
Yes. Blue eyes, tall,
quite good-looking.

1066
01:56:29,479 --> 01:56:31,271
A terrible man!

1067
01:56:32,616 --> 01:56:35,809
I believe we have some
interests in common.

1068
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:39,649
You have two gorgeous girls
in your family, Mr. Bonnet.

1069
01:56:40,625 --> 01:56:44,386
The other is upstairs, wrapped
in a shirt, in my room.

1070
01:56:49,802 --> 01:56:53,438
And which, may I ask,
do you intend to keep?

1071
01:56:54,006 --> 01:56:55,696
The real one.

1072
01:56:56,308 --> 01:57:00,069
- A very sound choice, if I may say so.
- I think so.

1073
01:57:00,846 --> 01:57:02,413
And the other?

1074
01:57:02,414 --> 01:57:05,184
I have plans for her, too.
I think you'll be pleased.

1075
01:57:05,185 --> 01:57:06,485
Really?

1076
01:57:06,486 --> 01:57:10,247
In fact I have to attend to her right
now, so if you'll both excuse me?

1077
01:57:13,426 --> 01:57:16,390
Extraordinary!
Is he always so abrupt?

1078
01:57:17,531 --> 01:57:19,392
Not in a closet.

1079
01:57:52,068 --> 01:57:53,394
Key!

1080
01:57:54,837 --> 01:57:59,098
You've done a wonderful job!
You sure you don't want any money?

1081
01:58:03,414 --> 01:58:05,673
You will be contacted.

1082
01:58:05,916 --> 01:58:10,019
Don't worry if it's not
in the near future.

1083
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:11,517
Right!

1084
01:58:11,989 --> 01:58:16,217
The code word will
be "togetherness."

1085
01:58:17,729 --> 01:58:20,420
"Togetherness." I got it.

1086
01:58:20,598 --> 01:58:23,426
- Happy landings!
- The same to you!

1087
01:59:34,777 --> 01:59:36,545
My dear boy, what a coup!

1088
01:59:36,546 --> 01:59:40,147
And he's the only collector
who'd never dare have it tested.

1089
01:59:40,451 --> 01:59:44,985
How much did you say
he was paying for the Venus, my son?

1090
01:59:45,122 --> 01:59:47,690
I didn't say, Papa.

1091
01:59:47,691 --> 01:59:51,427
But I'm sure you picked
a nice, round figure.

1092
01:59:51,428 --> 01:59:52,959
I have.

1093
01:59:53,264 --> 01:59:53,964
$0.00

1094
01:59:57,936 --> 02:00:00,971
Gift from Charles
Bonnet to Davis Leland.

1095
02:00:00,972 --> 02:00:03,470
- But this...
- Sit down, Mr. Bonnet.

1096
02:00:09,215 --> 02:00:11,508
You happen to be a forger.

1097
02:00:12,318 --> 02:00:14,786
My business happens to be
catching forgers...

1098
02:00:14,787 --> 02:00:16,388
and putting them in prison.

1099
02:00:16,389 --> 02:00:20,081
Yes, that could be very awkward.

1100
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:22,884
One of us has to retire.

1101
02:00:23,730 --> 02:00:27,457
Fair enough! Shall we
toss a coin for it?

1102
02:00:29,036 --> 02:00:32,103
I've already tossed
one on the way here.

1103
02:00:32,406 --> 02:00:35,700
- And?
- You lost.

1104
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:40,547
Come on. You had a great
run, and you were the best.

1105
02:00:40,548 --> 02:00:44,275
Hang up your brushes and paints,
and retire while you're on top.

1106
02:00:44,852 --> 02:00:47,043
What do you say, champ?

1107
02:00:52,127 --> 02:00:54,090
Here is my answer.

1108
02:00:58,567 --> 02:01:00,962
Indian wrestling at
a time like this?

1109
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:03,638
Nicole, my darling child.

1110
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:06,609
You tell her. I'm too moved.

1111
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:09,870
Papa has seen the light.
He's going straight.

1112
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:13,749
- Papa, will you be all right?
- He'll survive.

1113
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:16,819
If we miss our plane, we may
be getting married in prison.

1114
02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:18,854
This is a most
remarkable young man.

1115
02:01:18,855 --> 02:01:22,355
The way he explained things,
the path of righteousness...

1116
02:01:23,094 --> 02:01:24,928
became clearly defined.

1117
02:01:24,929 --> 02:01:28,895
Now hurry, my children, before
I break down completely.

1118
02:01:51,491 --> 02:01:53,283
The van Gogh?

1119
02:01:58,665 --> 02:02:02,198
<i>Seסor</i>. Welcome! Come in....

1120
02:02:08,175 --> 02:02:09,808
Who's that?

1121
02:02:14,114 --> 02:02:15,679
Papa's cousin.

1122
02:02:17,652 --> 02:02:20,150
From South America.

1123
02:02:22,357 --> 02:02:24,081
Go!

1124
02:02:29,197 --> 02:02:31,695
For someone who started
lying just recently...

1125
02:02:32,467 --> 02:02:34,898
you're showing a real flair.

1126
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:38,237
Thank you.

1127

2
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,456
Tired of the same old you?

3
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:33,629
Tired of being out of shape
and out of luck with the opposite sex?

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,338
Tired of being overweight
and under-attractive?

5
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:38,974
Yeah.

6
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:40,802
Oh, hello.

7
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:46,433
I'm White Goodman, owner, operator
and founder of Globo Gym America Corp.

8
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:50,604
I'm here to tell ya that you don't have
to be stuck with what you've got.

9
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:53,268
Hey, Rory. Looking good.

10
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:58,869
At Globo Gym we that understand "ugliness"
and "fatness" are genetic disorders,

11
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:01,326
much like baldness or necrophilia,

12
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:05,493
and it's only your fault if you don't hate
yourself enough to do something about it.

13
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:09,332
That's where we come in.

14
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:12,672
Globo Gym employs
a highly trained, quasi-cultural staff

15
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,712
of personal alteration specialists.

16
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:18,757
With our competitively priced
onsite cosmetic surgery,

17
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,051
we can turn that Frankenstein
you see in the mirror every morning

18
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:24,218
into a Franken-fine.

19
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:27,220
Of course, you'll still be you in a legal sense,

20
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:30,019
but think of it as a thinner,
more attractive, better you

21
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:32,184
than you could ever become without us.

22
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:36,192
How do I know?
Well, I'm not only the founder of Globo Gym,

23
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:38,274
I'm also a client.

24
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:45,904
That's me, six years and 600lbs ago,
before I knew how much I hated myself.

25
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:48,573
That all changed once I founded Globo Gym.

26
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:55,418
But don't just take my word for it. Listen
to these Globo gymers tell you how it is...

27
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:01,591
That feels good.

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,969
Oh, the tickle machine.

29
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:09,392
Crash, no. Crash, out.

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,971
Bad dog. No grundle.

31
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,436
Come on down and join the winning team,

32
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,778
because here at Globo Gym,
we're better than you.

33
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:22,071
And we know it.

34
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,235
Spare me.

35
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:36,046
Mr La Fleur, this is Doris
from the Department of Water and Power.

36
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:39,582
We've been trying to reach you,
but your phone was disconnected.

37
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:43,211
We'll be shutting off
your water and power at 5pm today

38
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:48,726
due to an eight-month overdue account.
Thank you and have a nice day.

39
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,022
This is Seth from Videorama.
The following DVDs are now overdue.

40
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:59,310
Drunken Hussies 3, Backdoor Patrol 5
and Mona Lisa Smile. Thank you.

41
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,664
Come on, baby, be there.
Be there.

42
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:27,880
It's gonna be a good day.
I'm proud of you.

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,569
We're just around the corner.
My gym's here. I promise we're almost there.

44
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,531
You guys are lifesavers.

45
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:49,654
I appreciate the effort.
Don't pull a hammy over it.

46
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,624
Gimme that garbage.
Shouldn't you be on a treadmill?

47
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:03,497
Hey, Peter.

48
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:07,293
- How's my little tax shelter this morning?
- Everything's shipshape.

49
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:10,802
Don't hold out on me. What's happening?

50
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:16,013
It's just I'm trying
this new voicemail-dating thing.

51
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:20,433
And, like, no one's even left me a message,
and it's been almost two months.

52
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:23,099
There's someone out there for everybody.

53
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:24,855
- You think?
- Absolutely.

54
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:29,654
In some cases, there's two somebodies for
one person. I like to call that "the jackpot".

55
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:31,818
See you later, dater.

56
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:35,786
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, Gordon.

57
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:38,281
- I'm wailing on my glutes.
- Sounds great.

58
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:42,588
I'm gonna shock the biceps later,
then some cardio. Keep the body guessing.

59
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:47,083
- I like to keep my body guessing.
- Sure. I wanted to ask you something.

60
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:49,880
- Did you catch the game last night?
- Can I say yes?

61
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,592
Amateur curling championships
on ESPN8.

62
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:56,097
- I had no idea.
- You missed a doozy. Really great stuff.

63
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:59,102
I feel dumb for asking,
but how did you hear about it?

64
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:02,854
- OSQ. Obscure Sports Quarterly.
- Of course, the OSQ.

65
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:05,610
Started reading it in college, for the chicks.

66
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:08,398
- I'm glad that worked out for you.
- Thanks, Peter.

67
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,062
- Bye.
- Love the orange and love the headphones.

68
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:13,731
When I come back,
I want you on a different machine.

69
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,830
- You need a spot?
- I'm cool, Pete.

70
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,872
OK, come on. Let's get this out of here.
You OK?

71
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:29,257
- You're like a human Chinese puzzle.
- Thanks, Pete.

72
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,667
All that weight is dangerous.

73
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:36,304
It'll be worth it when I make the cheerleading
squad. Prove to Amber that I'm not a loser.

74
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:41,182
Hang on a second. You wanna become
a cheerleader to prove you are not a loser?

75
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,761
Yeah. Why?

76
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:46,643
Nothing. High school's
changed a bit since I was a kid.

77
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:50,778
Plus, all anyone ever remembers is
what happened at last year's tryouts.

78
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,939
I'm the laughing stock of the school.

79
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:58,193
I'm sure it's not that big of a deal.
What happened at last year's tryouts?

80
00:05:58,912 --> 00:06:01,368
Justin Redmond. Ready and super-psyched.

81
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:05,035
- Hey, Amber.
- Hi, Justin. Good luck.

82
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:09,041
Good luck to you, making your judgments.

83
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:12,714
And from the girls' line,
we need girl number

84
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,342
00, Martha Johnstone.

85
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:25,344
Toss to hands, liberty and cradle out, OK?

86
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:29,055
I'm not wearing any panties.

87
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:33,483
Ready? One, two.

88
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:38,441
Liberty, ready?

89
00:06:50,338 --> 00:06:53,043
- Dude.
- Can he breathe?

90
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,423
- Wow.
- Yeah.

91
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:06,058
- It was the worst.
- Don't worry about this Amber situation.

92
00:07:06,145 --> 00:07:09,265
- lt'll all work itself out in the end.
- Thanks, Pete.

93
00:07:09,357 --> 00:07:11,682
You'll laugh at this one day.
I'm laughing.

94
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:14,895
Go at your own pace.
That's what it's there for.

95
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:20,773
- Who goes there?
- It's me. It's Peter.

96
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:28,368
'Tis about the matter of payment
for me membership.

97
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:30,452
Steve be a touch short this month.

98
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:32,701
That's all right.
Just pay me when you get the money.

99
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:37,209
The dread pirate Steve be in no man's debt.
I'll make a barter with you.

100
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,255
In exchange for your kindness,
I'll be splitting me buried treasure with you.

101
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,388
Once I find it, that be.

102
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:50,717
I'm flattered by the gesture, but
a couple of bucks here and there will be fine.

103
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:52,889
Thanks, Peter.

104
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:55,652
- I'll be on the StairMaster.
- OK, Steve.

105
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:59,684
- Next time, maybe just say "hello".
- Gar.

106
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,701
Hello.

107
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,742
It's not my birthday till next month,
but terrific.

108
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,039
I'm so sorry. Hi.

109
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:17,076
I'm Katherine Veatch with Hawthorne Stone.

110
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:20,212
- Your bank?
- Right. My bank.

111
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:24,797
- You are very attractive for a banker.
- Thank you. I'm not a banker, I'm a lawyer.

112
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,506
Really? What kind of law
are you involved in, pretty eyes?

113
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,091
Sexual harassment, mostly.

114
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:35,433
But I also handle real estate and tax law,
which is why I'm here.

115
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:39,023
- This place is in default?
- No. You're in foreclosure.

116
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:42,112
You were in default
when we sent you delinquency notices.

117
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:45,363
- I thought those were just warnings.
- They were warnings.

118
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:50,361
No one warned me. What happens now?
I make my payments out to somebody else?

119
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:54,155
You have 30 days to pay the balance
of your mortgage, or you lose your gym.

120
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,869
Perfect. What's the damage?
What do I owe you?

121
00:08:57,963 --> 00:08:59,706
$50,000.

122
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,176
Personal cheque gonna be OK? Might have
to wait till the end of the month to cash her?

123
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:10,889
I do have to switch some funds. The charity
I like to work with is gonna take a hit.

124
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:14,474
Mr La Fleur, I can assure you
this is a very serious situation.

125
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:18,263
Yeah.
This is extremely serious, Mrs Veatch.

126
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:23,731
It's Ms. I'll need to review all of your financial
statements and assess any tax liabilities.

127
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,738
Absolutely.
I don't know how you say "Ms" for "Mr",

128
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:29,611
but if there was a "Ms Mr",
I'm a Ms as well.

129
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:34,658
You do keep financial records?
Invoices, revenue reports, taxable income.

130
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:37,999
You kidding? I got a closet full of 'em.
I call 'em keepers.

131
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:46,624
- Problem is I've never really filed them.
- No kidding.

132
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,169
Just out of curiosity,
who would want to buy this place anyway?

133
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:53,051
Come on, squeeze it, squeeze it.

134
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:57,092
Yeah, come on, come on. Get it up.

135
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:00,638
One more, bitch. One more, bitch.

136
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:03,519
Yeah. Yeah.

137
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,101
- Now you're my bitch.
- Yeah.

138
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:10,855
Yeah, baby.

139
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,735
Involuntary spasm.
Look at the show. Enjoy the show.

140
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:20,834
This a bad time? I could come back.
Looks like some real dude sweat going on.

141
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:25,296
Add three pounds to the scales in the
women's locker room before you go home.

142
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:30,209
Refreshment?
I've got protein paste, carb laxative...

143
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:34,469
- Suffocated kumquat, perhaps?
- I'm trying to cut down on those.

144
00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:37,225
- They're good. They are good.
- Know what you mean.

145
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,385
Walk with me.

146
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:46,183
Hey, Brianna.
Cellulite seminar tomorrow, 0600.

147
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:50,396
Nice job, Susie.
You call that a sit-up?

148
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,945
Don't slack, Trevor.
I'm watching you.

149
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:54,776
There's a good energy in the gym.

150
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:56,825
Let me guess why you're here, Pete.

151
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,829
Because I bought out
the second mortgage on your gym.

152
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:04,909
You've got 30 days to make $50,000,
or your gym becomes my gym.

153
00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:07,210
I know we've had our differences...

154
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:11,046
Is that what you call
sleeping with three of my female trainers?

155
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:12,164
It was one night.

156
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:15,759
Or the strip-o-gram you sent me
for the Globo Gym one-year anniversary?

157
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:19,263
- It was meant to be congratulatory.
- It was also a man.

158
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:21,639
Let's not get hung up on details.

159
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,397
- We're both professionals.
- Really?

160
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:27,565
Last I heard, my gym makes money.
Yours doesn't.

161
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:31,481
My gym's worth over $4 million.
Your gym isn't worth four.

162
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,948
I have shareholders.
You haven't even got cupholders.

163
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,359
- Why would I want cupholders?
- The point is

164
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:41,489
Globo Gym is a beacon
of human physical perfection.

165
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,657
A benchmark in the fitness community.

166
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,706
Your "gym" is a skid mark
on the underpants of society.

167
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:53,458
See, Peter, I wasn't born
expecting the world to do me any favours.

168
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,671
I earned this body
and I built this temple

169
00:11:56,762 --> 00:12:00,462
out of nothing more than
a little can-do attitude and elbow grease.

170
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:03,393
And a large inheritance
from my father, Earl Goodman.

171
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:09,597
So if I choose to level Average Joe's to build
a parking structure for my members, so be it.

172
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:11,933
There's nothing you can do about it.

173
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:17,103
In 30 days, I'll be bulldozing that shit-heap
you call a gym into permanent nothingness.

174
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:22,573
I can only hope that you, and the mongrel
race that comprise your membership,

175
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:25,333
are inside it when I do.

176
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:28,240
Show Mr La Fleur out.

177
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:30,410
Turn it up high, Reggie.

178
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:33,873
I wanna burn.

179
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:40,628
So that's the deal. We got 30 days
to raise $50,000, or Average Joe's is history.

180
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:43,260
I got ten minutes. I'll open it up to some Q&A.

181
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,349
No need to raise your hands,
it's an open forum. OK, Owen, kick us off.

182
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:52,186
Yes, Peter, - and I'm just spitballing here -

183
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:56,937
but why don't we pay it off
in Canadian dollars and save some money?

184
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:01,193
Just so you know, if that's a route
you want to follow, it's 50,000 American.

185
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:04,652
It would be 70,000, roughly, Canadian dollars.

186
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:09,822
- How are we gonna come up with $120,000?
- Owen, you don't add them together.

187
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:14,211
Technically, Peter, I'm sorry to say this,
but it's more like $73,313...

188
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:17,997
It doesn't matter. We can't come up
with $50,000. We're screwed.

189
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:19,919
Gar.

190
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:25,384
- It's an insurmountable amount of money.
- No, it's not insurmountable. Come on.

191
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:28,429
We can't just sit back
and let Globo Gym take us over.

192
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,602
Average Joe's is too important.

193
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:33,977
Where do you go
when your wife changes the locks?

194
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,058
- Average Joe's.
- Right.

195
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:40,017
Dwight, Owen, what will you do
if Joe's goes under? Work at the airport?

196
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:44,027
- I ain't working at no airport again.
- No. Cos you hated it.

197
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:48,410
And, Steve, where do you go
to do whatever it is that you do?

198
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:52,957
- Gar. Joe's be the only place for Steve.
- Gar. You're right.

199
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,871
Do you see? There's no way I can go
back to working out at my high school.

200
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:01,712
They'd laugh at me there.
Lock me in lockers, make me eat clay.

201
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:04,671
But not here, not at Joe's.

202
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:09,720
I need this place.
You guys need this place. Come on.

203
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,141
I got it. I know how we can raise the money.

204
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:17,851
- How?
- Car wash.

205
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:37,915
What are the chances?
Same day, right across the street?

206
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,876
The girls beat us fair and square.

207
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:46,043
I am gonna be a gentleman about it and
congratulate every one of them, personally.

208
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:50,763
Guys. Not to be a nay-sayer or anything,
but the only customer we've had

209
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:55,391
is that weird guy
who keeps paying Justin to wash his truck.

210
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:05,316
That's it, boy.
Get in there nice and deep, like.

211
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,652
- That's not good.
- Gar. This sucks.

212
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,964
Relax, Justin, it's just a cutout.

213
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,419
At Globo Gym,
we're better than you and we know it.

214
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,381
Sign up now.

215
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:34,714
Do you smell that fitness? I do.

216
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,264
Rock it and shock it, baby.

217
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,392
You gotta burn it to earn it.

218
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:43,429
- What's in the envelope?
- Free 30-day memberships to Globo Gym.

219
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:47,358
- Cool.
- It's a joke. He sent it to us as an insult.

220
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,443
Maybe we could sell 'em for cash
cos the car wash cost us money.

221
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,106
- We're further away from saving this place?
- Yes.

222
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:56,824
- We'll never raise enough money.
- This blows.

223
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,906
Guys, I know this is tough to take,

224
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:03,044
but if an impromptu car wash
doesn't raise us the $50,000 we need,

225
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,251
I guess it just isn't in the cards.

226
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:11,756
Trust me here. If there was any way in
the world we could raise $50,000 in 30 days,

227
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:14,170
short of robbing a bank, I'd do it.

228
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,552
We could sell blood and semen.

229
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,468
What? Not mixed together.

230
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,766
Guys, I love the enthusiasm,

231
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,353
I love the energy here,
but we're looking at this the wrong way.

232
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,109
Let's celebrate the good times
that was Joe's.

233
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:30,609
We gotta start looking at this lrish-wake style.

234
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:37,530
Let me be the first
to say goodbye to Average Joe's.

235
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,748
We gave it a hell of a run, guys.
Now let's try to have some fun.

236
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,283
I'm gonna put on "The Thong Song",
and we'll tear this place apart.

237
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:47,702
Wait, wait. Peter. Peter.

238
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,622
We could play dodgeball.

239
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:55,378
That's very nice, Gordon, but everyone's
tired. Playing a game isn't gonna help.

240
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:01,260
There's a tournament in Las Vegas.
I feel so dumb I didn't think about it before.

241
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:04,268
I read about
the Las Vegas lnternational Dodgeball Open

242
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:06,596
every year in Obscure Sports Quarterly.

243
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,311
Of course. That's a totally common thing.

244
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:13,647
The best part is it's open to any team
that wins a regional qualifying match.

245
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:19,528
- How is dodgeball gonna get us the $50,000?
- They have a cash prize for the winner.

246
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,619
- How much?
- $50,000.

247
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:25,825
Guys, we are not gonna get $50,000
for playing dodgeball.

248
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:29,120
- Why not?
- None of us know how to play dodgeball.

249
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:33,790
I do. We played it in PE last year.
They showed us this film about it.

250
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:37,217
- Can you get your hands on that film?
- Sure, I guess.

251
00:17:37,304 --> 00:17:39,971
Can we please try to be serious
here for one second?

252
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:45,394
You said anything we could do to raise
the money. This is that anything. This is it.

253
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:48,893
Come on, show of hands.
Who wants to play dodgeball?

254
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:51,979
Come on.

255
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,976
Come on, Pete.

256
00:17:58,031 --> 00:18:01,317
You guys had me at blood and semen.
Come here.

257
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,080
You want it, don't you, fat boy?

258
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,124
You want that doughnut.

259
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,998
Go ahead and have a bite.

260
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:17,037
Just a little bite.
One little bite won't hurt you.

261
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,304
Momma.

262
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:29,934
- Sir, Katherine Veatch is here to see you.
- Give me 30 seconds and send her in.

263
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:31,564
Yes, sir.

264
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,114
Thank you.

265
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:58,547
Hello, Katherine. Good to see you.
I didn't know you were dropping by.

266
00:18:58,632 --> 00:19:02,167
- You asked me to come over.
- Did l?

267
00:19:03,387 --> 00:19:06,258
Are you reading the dictionary?

268
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:11,597
You caught me. I like to break
a mental sweat too. Grab a chair.

269
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:17,855
So, I trust everything's going swimmingly
with our acquisition of Average Joe's?

270
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:22,688
So far, yeah. There's a lot to do over there,
so I should probably get back.

271
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:26,779
- That is a really interesting painting.
- Thank you.

272
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:32,324
Yeah, that's me, taking the bull by the horns.
It's how I handle my business.

273
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:34,538
It's a metaphor.

274
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:38,837
- I get it.
- But that actually happened, though.

275
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:43,999
Anyway, we're a pretty tight-knit tribe here,
but there's always room for one more squaw.

276
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:48,256
So, please, whatever you do,
don't think of me as your boss.

277
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,920
- I don't.
- I don't want to get into a formal thing.

278
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:53,093
I'm White, you know.

279
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:55,060
W-h-i-t.

280
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:58,475
E.

281
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:01,271
Thanks, Mr Goodman,
but I'm contracted by the bank.

282
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:03,519
They just assigned me to your account.

283
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:09,615
Right, well. You work for the bank. Bank
works for me so, ipso fact, I'm your boss.

284
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:15,989
Point is, I would love to see your pretty
little bone structure around here some more.

285
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,241
There's no reason we need to be shackled

286
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:22,547
by the strictures of
the employee-employer relationship.

287
00:20:22,632 --> 00:20:25,204
Unless you're into that sort of thing.

288
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:28,087
In which case,
I got some shackles in the back.

289
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:31,879
I'm just kidding.
But seriously, I've got 'em.

290
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:34,725
I'm just doing my job, Mr Goodman.

291
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:40,149
In fact, I actually prefer it over there.

292
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:44,098
Really? You like it with those freaks
over there in Loser-Town?

293
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:47,444
They're not freaks.
They're people, just like you and me.

294
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:51,030
People?

295
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:53,690
"People, just like you and me."
Oh, man.

296
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:57,619
That is what I love about you, Kate.
You've got a "personality".

297
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:05,837
That is rich. A real sauciness
that I find extremely attractive.

298
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:10,167
We should mate.

299
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,052
- What?
- Date.

300
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:15,222
We should date some time. Socially.
Go out and kick it.

301
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:19,059
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

302
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:22,513
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.

303
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,024
In some cultures, they only eat vomit.

304
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:30,936
I never been there,
but I read about it in a book.

305
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:34,780
I'm sorry, Mr Goodman.
I don't date clients.

306
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:38,244
I get it.

307
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:41,912
Don't crap where you eat. I understand.

308
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,868
Me'Shell.
Please escort Ms Veatch out.

309
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:51,711
And, Katherine, make sure
my acquisition of that gym goes smoothly.

310
00:21:51,802 --> 00:21:55,088
They're up to something over there.
I can smell it.

311
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:08,231
Uber-American lnstructional films,
teaching America's youth since 1938.

312
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,864
Hey, there, Timmy.

313
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,699
Holy mackerel, mister.
You scared the jeepers out of me.

314
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:24,655
How'd you like to take a break
from that fine lead-based paint,

315
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,161
and learn about dodgeball?

316
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:28,161
Boy, would l.

317
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:35,424
- Where am l, mister?
- You're in a Chinese opium den, Timmy.

318
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,010
This is where dodgeball
was invented in the 15th century,

319
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:41,423
by opium-addicted Chinamen.

320
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:45,016
Back then, the Chinamen threw
severed human heads at each another

321
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:48,473
instead of the ADAA-approved balls
we use today.

322
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,146
ADAA?

323
00:22:52,235 --> 00:22:55,936
That's the American Dodgeball
Association of America.

324
00:22:56,031 --> 00:23:01,617
Dodgeball is played with six players
on each team, and six rubber balls.

325
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:04,906
The object of the game
is to eliminate the opposing players.

326
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:09,495
Once all the players on one team are
eliminated, the opposing team wins.

327
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:13,665
Wow. I can't wait
to get the fellas together and play.

328
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:18,551
Hang on a second there, sport.

329
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:21,756
- Patches O'Houlihan.
- That's right, Timmy.

330
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:27,887
Patches O'Houlihan. Seven-time ADAA
All-Star is here to take you the rest of the way.

331
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,643
- Jeepers. Really?
- You betcha, champ.

332
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:36,146
If you catch a ball that's thrown at you
before it hits the ground,

333
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:39,606
the player who threw that ball is out,
not you.

334
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:44,527
Plus, another player from your team
gets to come back into the game.

335
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:48,154
- It's a two-player swing.
- Thanks, Patches.

336
00:23:48,248 --> 00:23:51,119
I can't wait to start my own team at school.

337
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,333
Attaboy, Tiger.

338
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:59,090
But remember, dodgeball is a sport
of violence, exclusion and degradation.

339
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:02,296
So, when you're picking players in gym class,

340
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:06,550
remember to pick the bigger,
stronger kids for your team.

341
00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:12,265
That way, you can all gang up
on the weaker ones, like Winston here.

342
00:24:17,277 --> 00:24:20,195
Nice one, son.
You'll be an all-star yet.

343
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,861
Just remember the five Ds of dodgeball.

344
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:26,737
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and

345
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:28,452
dodge.

346
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:31,574
Till next time.
This is Patches O'Houlihan,

347
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:36,411
saying, "Take care of your balls
and they'll take care of you."

348
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:40,883
OK, guys. Any questions? Great.

349
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:45,842
I signed us up for the sub-regional qualifier
tomorrow at the Waldorf rec centre.

350
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:47,887
But we haven't even practised yet.

351
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:51,805
We have to qualify for the Vegas Open.
Tomorrow's regional's our last chance.

352
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:57,351
Everyone, just relax. I've always found
the best way to learn a sport is by playing it.

353
00:24:57,442 --> 00:25:00,227
If anyone needs me,
I'll be in my office doing Mad Libs.

354
00:25:00,318 --> 00:25:02,560
Thanks, Peter. Appreciate that a lot.

355
00:25:02,654 --> 00:25:04,563
OK, I think everybody knows...

356
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:12,163
- Don't you have an office of your own?
- Yes, I do have an office.

357
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:15,118
A very nice office
with a view and air-conditioning.

358
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:18,543
- Rub it in.
- What I don't have in my office is a closet

359
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:23,586
of 30 years of financial transactions,
devoid of any filing system known to man.

360
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:27,625
Hard to believe I only got a semester
of junior college under my belt.

361
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:32,715
Do you realise you haven't collected
any membership fees in 13 months?

362
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:36,808
I'm curious. Is it strictly apathy,
or do you really not have a goal in life?

363
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:40,644
I found that if you have a goal,
you might not reach it.

364
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:44,399
But if you don't have one,
then you are never disappointed.

365
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:48,983
I gotta tell you, it feels phenomenal.

366
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:52,361
I guess that makes sense, in a really sad way.

367
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:55,206
Sad? You wanna know what's sad?

368
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,159
Six grown men playing dodgeball.

369
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:02,748
Since I'm here, I'm gonna go ahead
and do some abs, go shock it up.

370
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:06,539
I like to work out all the time
for this kind of sporting event.

371
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:09,469
Gotta be limber and loose.
That's the only way to play.

372
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:14,179
Hey, you guys take vitamins?
I take vitamins all the time...

373
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:18,974
Dodgeball, eh?

374
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:24,103
If Peter La Fleur thinks a few
red rubber balls can save his sorry gym,

375
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:27,063
he's in for quite a surprise.

376
00:26:35,286 --> 00:26:38,287
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
- Hey, Pete.

377
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:42,702
- Bad morning, boss?
- They usually follow good nights, Dwight.

378
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:44,952
- Hey, Gord, your family's here.
- Where?

379
00:26:45,046 --> 00:26:47,288
- Right over there.
- Great.

380
00:26:47,382 --> 00:26:50,797
She knows I don't like it
when she watches me. I get all nervous.

381
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:53,755
- Kids take after you.
- Yeah. She's their stepmother.

382
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,931
I remarried three years ago.
An lnternet mail-order thing.

383
00:26:57,016 --> 00:27:01,227
- How's that working out for you?
- Really great. Really great.

384
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:02,771
Hey, honey.

385
00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:07,567
L for love. Good times.

386
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:09,727
L for love? That doesn't mean love...

387
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:12,393
People have different translations for things.

388
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:16,902
That's a special bond that you have with
your mail-order wife. I think that's nice.

389
00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:19,235
- How many teams are in this qualifier?
- Two.

390
00:27:19,329 --> 00:27:21,737
If we beat this team,
we're in the Vegas Open?

391
00:27:21,832 --> 00:27:23,706
- Yeah.
- That seems pretty simple.

392
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:28,786
- Who's the other team?
- I have it right here. Just a sec.

393
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,542
- Troop 417.
- Christ. We're playing Boy Scouts?

394
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:35,423
Not quite.

395
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,641
Bollocks.

396
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:53,353
Troop 417, ready.

397
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:55,154
Average Joe's, ready.

398
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:58,610
Set. Dodgeball.

399
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:29,553
I'm gonna send you to hell.

400
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:44,525
- I'm really sorry. Are you all right?
- Why would you hit a girl? Why?

401
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:46,661
I am so sorry. Are you OK?

402
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,414
Winner - Troop 417.

403
00:28:51,503 --> 00:28:53,579
In your face.

404
00:28:53,672 --> 00:28:58,050
You're adopted.
Your parents don't even love you.

405
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:06,467
And now, without further ado,
it gives me great pleasure to award...

406
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:12,432
I'm sorry.
We have a bit of a problem here.

407
00:29:13,191 --> 00:29:16,442
Unfortunately for Troop 417,

408
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:20,524
during the ADAA-required
random drug screening,

409
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:26,036
one of your player's urine tested positive
for three separate types of anabolic steroids,

410
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,034
and a low-grade beaver tranquilliser.

411
00:29:30,124 --> 00:29:34,253
I'm afraid, by rule,
your team must be disqualified.

412
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:37,208
Goddamn you, Bernice.

413
00:29:37,923 --> 00:29:41,374
By the power vested in me,
I declare the winner of this year's

414
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:46,924
Dodgeball Regional Qualifying Tournament
and Grammar Jamboree to be

415
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:48,842
Average Joe's Gym.

416
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:53,479
You lied.

417
00:30:00,403 --> 00:30:05,528
All I'm saying to you, Kate, is that you can
admit the real reason why you showed up.

418
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:10,114
I was in the neighbourhood and
I thought you could use a cheering section.

419
00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:13,904
Kate, if you wanna join the team,
all you have to do is ask.

420
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:16,835
Thank you, Peter. I don't.

421
00:30:17,754 --> 00:30:20,541
It is obvious that you dig me.

422
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:22,624
- You're hooked on La Fleur.
- God.

423
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:27,712
I've been through this many times. I'm sorry.
You can't stay away from me. I'm so stupid.

424
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:33,925
I'll admit that, in spite of yourself, you have
brief moments where you're not completely...

425
00:30:35,604 --> 00:30:38,641
What? I'm not completely what?

426
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:41,484
Pathetic.

427
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:45,278
Hey, White. I didn't think
that Nazi camp got out until eight.

428
00:30:45,364 --> 00:30:49,908
- Did you decide to skip arts and crafts?
- Yes, I did.

429
00:30:49,993 --> 00:30:54,038
Hello, Kate.
I wasn't aware I was paying you to socialise.

430
00:30:54,122 --> 00:31:00,920
- You're not. I'm off the clock.
- lsn't it "convenient" for you, and the clock?

431
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:05,133
I dropped by to congratulate you
on your victory by disqualification

432
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:09,214
and introduce you to the team that
will win the Las Vegas Dodgeball Open.

433
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:11,047
My team.

434
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:14,798
Allow me the pleasure of introducing you to

435
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:16,969
Blade.

436
00:31:17,895 --> 00:31:19,972
Laser.

437
00:31:20,982 --> 00:31:23,271
Blazer.

438
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,893
I've believe you've met
my fitness consigliere, Me'Shell.

439
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:31,566
- We met.
- And I almost forgot our last player.

440
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:36,617
Meet Fran Stalinofskivitchdavitovichski.

441
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,927
In her home country of Romanovia,
dodgeball is the national sport.

442
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:55,472
Her nuclear power plant's team won
the championship five years running,

443
00:31:55,557 --> 00:32:00,765
which makes her the deadliest woman
on earth with a dodgeball.

444
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:02,647
Ball me, Blazer.

445
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:05,472
Show them, Fran.

446
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:12,615
That's just her change-up.

447
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,775
End of demo.

448
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:17,786
We are the Globo Gym Purple Cobras

449
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:21,621
and we will, we will rock you.

450
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:28,875
I think that guy might really be dead.

451
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:34,844
Wait a minute. How can you be
entered in the Las Vegas Open?

452
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,219
You didn't win a regional qualifying match.

453
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:40,639
Oh, my God. We never even won
a regional qualifying match.

454
00:32:40,726 --> 00:32:42,802
Yeah. Now I remember.

455
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:46,596
The dodgeball chancellor's
an extremely personal friend of mine.

456
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:49,976
I helped him shed some unwanted poundage
before beach season.

457
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:52,774
So close your rule book
on that one, Poindextor.

458
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:57,443
White, we didn't come here to "rumble".
We came here to celebrate as a team.

459
00:32:57,536 --> 00:33:00,701
There's plenty of bar here
for you and the Globo-nauts.

460
00:33:00,787 --> 00:33:02,579
Team?

461
00:33:02,664 --> 00:33:06,663
What team?
Your best player thinks he's a pirate.

462
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:13,582
First of all, he is way more
of a pirate than you will ever be.

463
00:33:13,676 --> 00:33:19,013
Secondly, we don't know who our best player
is yet. We've only had one game.

464
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:23,890
- It could be any one of us at this point.
- Go ahead, make your jokes, Mr

465
00:33:23,977 --> 00:33:26,054
Jokey... Joke-maker.

466
00:33:26,147 --> 00:33:29,063
But let me hit you with
some knowledge. Quit now.

467
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:34,440
Save yourself the embarrassment of losing
with these losers in Las Vegas, La Fleur.

468
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,732
Alliteration aside,
I'll take my chances in the tournament.

469
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:42,403
- Yeah, you will take your chances.
- I know. I just said that.

470
00:33:42,496 --> 00:33:45,662
- I know you did.
- I'm not sure where you're going with this.

471
00:33:45,748 --> 00:33:49,200
- I'm not sure where you're going with this.
- That's what I said.

472
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:53,624
- That's what I'm saying to you.
- All right.

473
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:55,256
Touche.

474
00:33:57,968 --> 00:34:00,970
We're gonna split,
but we'll see you at the tournament.

475
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:06,050
And, La Fleur, best bring your bib
cos it's gonna get messy.

476
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:12,889
Are you all right? You OK?

477
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:17,269
Let's bounce. Cobras.

478
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:26,743
OK, guys, let's just get ourselves cleaned up
and head on home, all right?

479
00:34:33,294 --> 00:34:34,575
Hey, you.

480
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:39,464
That was the worst damn display
of dodgeball I've seen in 40 years.

481
00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:43,050
You want a dodgeball victory,
you've gotta grab it by its haunches

482
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:46,554
and hump it into submission.
That's the only way.

483
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:50,009
OK, crazy guy. I'm gonna go home now.

484
00:34:50,102 --> 00:34:53,187
I ain't crazy and I ain't a guy.

485
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:57,311
The name's Patches O'Houlihan.

486
00:34:57,402 --> 00:35:00,071
I'm your new coach.

487
00:35:00,154 --> 00:35:03,109
Patches O'Houlihan?
The guy from the dodgeball film?

488
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,035
- Yeah. He said he wants to coach us.
- You said yes?

489
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,246
I figured the steady hand of a seasoned
dodgeball coach could only benefit us.

490
00:35:10,331 --> 00:35:13,415
A'iight.
But he's not weird or anything, is he?

491
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:16,419
No. No, he's totally normal.

492
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:30,889
I love the smell of queef in the morning.

493
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:33,052
I mean normal for us.

494
00:35:33,562 --> 00:35:35,471
Line up, ladies.

495
00:35:35,564 --> 00:35:37,936
- What does he mean, line up?
- Now.

496
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:44,852
If you're gonna learn to be
true dodgeballers,

497
00:35:44,947 --> 00:35:48,780
then you've got to learn
the five Ds of dodgeball:

498
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:51,953
dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge.

499
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:58,077
If you master the five Ds,
no amount of balls on earth can hit you.

500
00:35:59,296 --> 00:36:02,547
- Queer bait, go ahead.
- Me, or...

501
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:07,543
Yeah, shouldn't we learn by dodging balls
that are thrown at us, or...

502
00:36:07,637 --> 00:36:11,006
That's what this sack of wrenches is for.

503
00:36:16,312 --> 00:36:18,982
If you can dodge a wrench,
you can dodge a ball.

504
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:21,142
What?

505
00:36:30,909 --> 00:36:32,737
Any other questions?

506
00:36:32,828 --> 00:36:35,035
My God.

507
00:36:35,123 --> 00:36:40,246
Yeah. Patches, are you sure
that this is completely necessary?

508
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:42,791
Necessary?

509
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:47,174
- Is it necessary for me to drink my urine?
- Probably not.

510
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:52,301
No. But I do it anyway
because it's sterile and I like the taste.

511
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:53,848
OK.

512
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:59,436
If you're leading this squad, La Fleur, you've
got to learn to do the dance in the dark.

513
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:02,187
Here, put that on.

514
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:04,646
All right, ladies, buckle up.

515
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:06,360
It's showtime.

516
00:37:09,155 --> 00:37:11,647
Dodge, duck, dip. Dive.

517
00:37:13,327 --> 00:37:14,952
Dodge.

518
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:16,862
Dive.

519
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:20,204
Dip. Dive. Dodge.

520
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:25,626
I've got three weeks to whip you
suck-ass failure junkies into shape.

521
00:37:25,714 --> 00:37:29,332
Come on. I get better runs in my shorts.

522
00:37:29,968 --> 00:37:35,091
Catch a ball, one of their guys goes out.
One of our guys comes back in.

523
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,431
That's the way you hurt 'em.
That's the way you win.

524
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:43,061
Let's go. A little hustle here.

525
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:51,981
That's really good, Peter.

526
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,995
Come on. Only 19 miles to go.

527
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,995
Attaboy.

528
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:08,877
Next man.

529
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:12,130
Good luck to you, Gordon.
Remember it's 90% mental.

530
00:38:12,216 --> 00:38:13,248
Okey-dokey.

531
00:38:13,342 --> 00:38:17,590
If you can dodge traffic,
you can dodge a ball.

532
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:23,265
You got it, Gord.

533
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:31,232
- I'm fine. I'm OK.
- OK, there.

534
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:40,198
- Man.
- Wake up, Smithy.

535
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:50,460
Hell, son. You're about as useful
as a cock-flavoured lollipop.

536
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:53,579
Quick feet, fast hands.

537
00:38:53,674 --> 00:38:55,632
Catch it and throw.

538
00:38:56,302 --> 00:39:01,177
Pick up the pace. What a bunch of females.

539
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:07,768
Jesus. Gimme that.

540
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:12,189
You couldn't hit water
if you fell out of a boat.

541
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:15,230
Where's your killer instinct?
You gotta get angry.

542
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:19,021
You gotta get mean.
That's the only way you can play.

543
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:22,447
I guess I'm not really an angry person.

544
00:39:26,747 --> 00:39:29,417
Are you angry now?

545
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:34,459
- Breathe it out.
- Come on, let's get going here.

546
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:43,928
Little help?

547
00:39:52,983 --> 00:39:55,936
What? Eight years of softball.

548
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:59,811
- Man, she gotta be a lesbian.
- She is not a lesbian.

549
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:02,609
All I know is that dyke can play.

550
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,370
Come on, come on.

551
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:19,038
- Please.
- We need you. You're really good.

552
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:21,124
Owen'll be team manager if you play.

553
00:40:21,217 --> 00:40:22,842
- I will?
- Shut up.

554
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:25,882
Look, I find White Goodman creepy,
just like you do...

555
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:28,381
All the more reason for you to join us.

556
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:31,760
Come on, Kate.
Time to put your mouth where our balls are.

557
00:40:31,853 --> 00:40:36,148
Sorry, I can't. I'm under contract.
It'd be a conflict of interest.

558
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,857
Suit yourself.

559
00:40:38,945 --> 00:40:42,692
All right, you heard Billie-Jean King.
No crying in the breast milk.

560
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,069
We got plenty of work to do. Let's go.

561
00:40:48,828 --> 00:40:52,577
We punch the pizza dough down,
and it's time to sauce it up.

562
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,742
Boy, is my mouth watering.

563
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:58,285
You want to put a big dollop
of that tangy red on the dough,

564
00:40:58,379 --> 00:41:01,333
then use the cheese to shove it to the edge.

565
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:03,463
Sir, I need you to take a look at...

566
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:05,509
No. What...

567
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:10,340
What...
What have I said about knocking?

568
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:12,800
- Always knock.
- Sorry, sir.

569
00:41:12,894 --> 00:41:18,349
What is so important that you need to
interrupt me in my private reflection period?

570
00:41:18,899 --> 00:41:20,975
These.

571
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:29,657
- They're getting better.
- Yes. I can see that, Me'Shell.

572
00:41:29,744 --> 00:41:34,205
I'm through playing games. It's time
to end this square dance once and for all.

573
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,447
What about the girl? She can throw.

574
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:40,586
I'll simply have to woo Kate
a bit sooner than nature intended.

575
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:43,542
But rest assured, Me'Shell.

576
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:49,172
There's no resisting when
White Goodman puts on his shiny shoes.

577
00:42:10,075 --> 00:42:12,280
- Who is it?
- It's White.

578
00:42:14,912 --> 00:42:17,866
- Surprise.
- White.

579
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,251
What... What are you doing here?

580
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:24,662
How do you know where I live?

581
00:42:24,756 --> 00:42:27,045
It's called the Freedom of lnformation Act.

582
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:30,832
The hippies finally got something right.
Just kiddin'. Not really.

583
00:42:30,927 --> 00:42:34,760
Hey. I got some great news. Sit down.

584
00:42:37,643 --> 00:42:39,719
- What is it?
- You're fired.

585
00:42:39,811 --> 00:42:41,520
- I'm what?
- You're fired.

586
00:42:41,605 --> 00:42:45,438
I told the bank that you were stealing
and drinking on the job. They bought it.

587
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:48,810
They signed some other
pencil pusher to my account.

588
00:42:48,903 --> 00:42:51,145
Why would you do that?

589
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:54,403
I'm here to begin my courtship of you, Kate.

590
00:42:54,493 --> 00:42:57,529
- You fired me so I'd date you?
- Yuh-huh.

591
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,491
You are a crazy little man.

592
00:43:00,582 --> 00:43:03,287
I know you've been hiding
some feelings for me.

593
00:43:03,377 --> 00:43:05,500
Yeah. Nausea.

594
00:43:05,588 --> 00:43:09,002
If you don't leave in two seconds,
you'll know how that feels.

595
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,636
You like the freaky stuff, huh?
That's cool.

596
00:43:14,554 --> 00:43:16,427
I can be naughty, too.

597
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:20,590
Real, freakin' naughty.

598
00:43:22,145 --> 00:43:24,185
- You a naughty freak?
- Need help leaving?

599
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:28,017
This doesn't concern you, La Fleur.

600
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:31,478
Not nearly as much as your hair does.
That's for sure.

601
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:35,354
But I believe she asked you to leave.

602
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:42,036
I get it. You caught the scent
of a lesser stag in your nostrils.

603
00:43:42,123 --> 00:43:46,701
Pity. I'll let you have
your little moment, La Fleur,

604
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:54,172
cos after this tournament, your gym,
your life and your gal are gonna be mine.

605
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:56,418
All mine.

606
00:43:57,096 --> 00:43:59,089
To be continued...

607
00:43:59,182 --> 00:44:01,967
You don't get to touch me, ever.

608
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:04,514
OK, Romeo. Let me help you up.

609
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:08,221
Get off me.
Don't you touch me.

610
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:13,353
It is over between us, Kate.

611
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:16,482
Nobody makes me bleed my own blood.
Nobody.

612
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:34,164
- At least that wasn't weird.
- Yeah.

613
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:37,259
- Do I smell cookies?
- Hey.

614
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:41,127
Dear Barbara.

615
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:50,353
I like unicorns.

616
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:55,226
I know you said no to joining the team,

617
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,233
but I'd like you to reconsider
as a personal favour to me.

618
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,031
- Peter...
- Before you answer,

619
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,690
you should know you'd have
your own changing room.

620
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:05,993
- Really?
- Sort of.

621
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,494
And there's also this.

622
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:12,534
- OK, what's this?
- I overdid.

623
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:18,670
Look at you. Two expired movie passes

624
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:23,302
and a coupon for one free back rub
from Peter La Fleur.

625
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:28,097
- Play your cards right, could be a full body.
- Will you just stop, please?

626
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:32,230
I don't want your perk package.
I don't want your back rub.

627
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:36,013
I just want to see White Goodman's face
when we win that tournament.

628
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,481
- You're in?
- I'm in.

629
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:47,652
Las Vegas. A city built of hot sand,
broken dreams and $5 lobster.

630
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:51,495
A city where you can get a happy ending,
if you pay a little extra.

631
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,867
A city home to a sporting event
greater than the World Cup,

632
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,457
World Series and World War ll combined.

633
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:03,842
Live from Las Vegas, it's the Las Vegas
lnternational Dodgeball Open

634
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,763
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho" -

635
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:11,639
bringing you the finest in seldom-seen sports
from around the globe since 1999.

636
00:46:11,726 --> 00:46:15,096
If it's almost a sport, we've got it here.

637
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:21,024
Hello, everybody, and welcome to this year's
Las Vegas lnternational Dodgeball Open

638
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,397
brought to you exclusively
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

639
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:28,239
We're coming to you live from
the Las Vegas University Learning Annex.

640
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:30,200
My name is Cotton McKnight

641
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:34,154
and with me, as always,
is my partner in crime, Pepper Brooks.

642
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,123
Yeah. Cotton, hey.

643
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:41,666
Everybody, 32 teams in play, that means
four wins is gonna get you in the final match,

644
00:46:41,756 --> 00:46:45,208
the fifth win getting you
the 50K that everyone's chasing.

645
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,334
Cotton.

646
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:51,766
There's an electricity in the air,
a palpable hue of anticipation.

647
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:55,349
Immortality - five simple victories away.

648
00:46:55,437 --> 00:47:00,312
They've come from all over - Kathmandu
to Timbuktu, and all points in-between -

649
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,861
to compete in the one
true human test - dodgeball.

650
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,317
A reminder.
All players must be vaccinated

651
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:12,737
for cholera, syphilis and shingles
before play begins.

652
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:17,241
Again, dyslexic players
will not be allowed on the court.

653
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:21,794
Team Blitzkrieg to the tournament floor
for a first-round match.

654
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,247
Only ADAA balls will be used.

655
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,172
Personal balls of any kind
are strictly prohibited.

656
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:31,752
- Hey.
- Hey. What's in the box?

657
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:36,425
Guys, I figured a real dodgeball team
needs real dodgeball uniforms.

658
00:47:36,518 --> 00:47:40,386
So I threw out those old ratty ones
and designed these myself.

659
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:44,857
All right. Now we got our thing going on,
maybe we'll start smacking each other.

660
00:47:44,942 --> 00:47:47,019
I hope everything fits.

661
00:47:49,072 --> 00:47:51,694
- Wait.
- Nice.

662
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:56,326
This isn't right.
This isn't what I ordered.

663
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:03,991
- What's this?
- What the hell is that? This is screwed up.

664
00:48:04,962 --> 00:48:07,917
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Don't worry.

665
00:48:08,007 --> 00:48:10,213
- We'll play in what we've got on.
- We can't.

666
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:13,088
ADAA rules require we wear
matching uniforms.

667
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:17,391
I don't think they require ass-less chaps, OK?

668
00:48:17,476 --> 00:48:22,682
Everybody, calm down. We've got plenty
of time to find other uniforms before we play.

669
00:48:22,771 --> 00:48:26,271
Ladies, we gotta get on the court
or we're gonna forfeit the game.

670
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:30,226
Come on, let's go.
Let's see some movement. Chop-chop.

671
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:32,360
I don't see any movement. Let's go.

672
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:45,787
How about those dodgeball dancers, folks?

673
00:48:45,878 --> 00:48:49,792
- That is some good, clean, family fun, Cot.
- Right you are.

674
00:48:49,881 --> 00:48:52,337
Here comes Germany's Team Blitzkrieg.

675
00:48:52,426 --> 00:48:55,842
The reigning European champ
hopes to extend their empire here.

676
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,004
Appeasement be damned.

677
00:48:58,097 --> 00:49:01,431
Here comes
the relatively unknown challengers,

678
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:05,764
a regional qualifying team,
Average Joe's Gymnasium.

679
00:49:15,572 --> 00:49:17,815
My sweet Jesus.

680
00:49:18,784 --> 00:49:20,824
That's rad.

681
00:49:20,912 --> 00:49:23,747
Hey, asshole, you guys suck.

682
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:26,745
Thank you. Nice to be in Vegas.

683
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:29,539
Hi. We're all here and

684
00:49:29,629 --> 00:49:31,539
we are ready to play.

685
00:49:34,383 --> 00:49:36,921
- OK.
- OK.

686
00:49:38,762 --> 00:49:42,974
We get our first glimpse of the Average Joe's
squad, sporting unwieldy uniforms.

687
00:49:43,058 --> 00:49:45,894
I feel like I'm watching a Cher video.

688
00:49:45,978 --> 00:49:47,971
Average Joe's, ready.

689
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:50,021
Blitzkrieg, ready.

690
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:51,517
Dodgeball.

691
00:49:51,607 --> 00:49:56,436
And we're under way. Average Joe's
versus the heavily favoured German team.

692
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:00,362
Of course, S&M gear first made
popular by the lyric poet, Sappho,

693
00:50:00,451 --> 00:50:03,487
- from the island of Lesbos.
- Clean hit. You're out.

694
00:50:03,578 --> 00:50:08,371
Leather and latex belong in the bedroom,
not on the dodgeball court.

695
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:13,914
Where's that training?
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, dodge.

696
00:50:14,422 --> 00:50:18,966
Captain Peter La Fleur gets eliminated
and coach O'Houlihan is not happy.

697
00:50:26,268 --> 00:50:28,936
This Average Joe's team
doesn't look up to snuff.

698
00:50:30,187 --> 00:50:33,639
Midline infraction.
You went over the line, you're out.

699
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:36,189
The Average Joe's catches a break there.

700
00:50:36,277 --> 00:50:39,860
The Germans still dominating
this Maginot Line-like defence.

701
00:50:39,947 --> 00:50:42,521
Good toss by the submissive out there.

702
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:46,779
Just two players left for Joe...
Check that. Make it one.

703
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:49,788
Looks like Average Joe's
might be heading home early.

704
00:50:50,249 --> 00:50:54,163
It's all up to the only player
without a Y-chromosome, Kate Veatch.

705
00:50:55,338 --> 00:50:57,413
What a throw.

706
00:50:57,506 --> 00:50:59,629
Hold your phone, she's got a cannon.

707
00:50:59,717 --> 00:51:01,377
Yes.

708
00:51:01,469 --> 00:51:05,714
- Come on, Kate.
- You're the only man out there. Give it to 'em.

709
00:51:05,805 --> 00:51:11,096
Germans have a two-one advantage.
Great catch. La Fleur's back in the game.

710
00:51:11,186 --> 00:51:15,764
How about that? A two-on-one switcheroo.
Now Joe's has the upper hand.

711
00:51:15,857 --> 00:51:17,815
- Great deflection.
- Take it to him.

712
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:22,647
- He's ball-less now.
- He doesn't have any balls, Cotton.

713
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,656
Winner. Average Joe's.

714
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:29,568
My sweet dick, it's magic.

715
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
Hey, all right.

716
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:36,709
My. The Germans losing in the first round
and Average Joe's wins in a shocking upset.

717
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:39,547
I feel shocked.

718
00:51:48,264 --> 00:51:50,304
Losers.

719
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,569
You must be Daddy.

720
00:52:04,947 --> 00:52:09,277
Average Joe's has shocked the dodgeball
pundits and made it to tomorrow's round

721
00:52:09,368 --> 00:52:13,069
where we'll separate the wheat from the chaff,
the men from the boys,

722
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,331
and the awkwardly feminine
from the possibly Canadian.

723
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:19,666
Don't go anywhere, folks.
It's just getting exciting.

724
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:27,709
- What the hell.
- That guy's a dickhead.

725
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,924
You wanted to see me, Patches?

726
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:40,887
You did good out there, real good.
You're a natural leader, La Fleur.

727
00:52:40,982 --> 00:52:44,102
Those men and that muff-diver believe in you.

728
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,684
Kate's not a muff-diver.

729
00:52:48,489 --> 00:52:50,566
Hey. That's for you.

730
00:52:51,952 --> 00:52:55,202
- I can't accept this.
- You're a hell of a player, Peter.

731
00:52:55,289 --> 00:52:57,695
You earned it.

732
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:02,701
I've got some hookers in my room.
What do you say we go celebrate? My treat.

733
00:53:02,795 --> 00:53:06,045
No, thanks, I'll just stick
with the scarf, but thank you.

734
00:53:06,131 --> 00:53:08,208
Suit yourself, queer.

735
00:53:18,477 --> 00:53:20,304
- Sorry.
- Justin?

736
00:53:20,396 --> 00:53:23,101
Amber.
Jeez Louise, what are you doing here?

737
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:28,351
- The National Cheerleading Championships.
- Oh, yeah, the NCCs. That's so awesome.

738
00:53:28,446 --> 00:53:32,358
- We're in the finals tomorrow. And you?
- I'm in the dodgeball tournament.

739
00:53:32,448 --> 00:53:37,194
These are my team-mates,
Dwight, Ms Veatch and Gordon.

740
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:39,576
This is Amber.

741
00:53:39,665 --> 00:53:41,822
Come on, I wanna ride the roller coaster.

742
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:46,828
- Hey, Derek. Sweet 'do, man.
- Get bent, helmet. Let's go, Amber.

743
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:52,544
- It was nice to see you. Good luck tomorrow.
- And also you. You look healthy... good.

744
00:53:53,427 --> 00:53:54,970
What?

745
00:53:55,054 --> 00:53:58,056
Don't worry about that guy, Justin.
He's a total jerk.

746
00:53:58,141 --> 00:54:01,592
He'll probably fall off the roller coaster
and break every bone.

747
00:54:01,686 --> 00:54:04,355
- Nice, Dwight.
- I'm just saying, it happens.

748
00:54:04,439 --> 00:54:07,013
My cousin Ray-Ray. Boop. Dead.

749
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:08,307
Thanks, man.

750
00:54:12,863 --> 00:54:15,864
Let's huddle up here.
We've got some work to do.

751
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,157
We got lucky in the first round.

752
00:54:18,244 --> 00:54:21,862
We caught those dirty Krauts napping,
but that won't happen again,

753
00:54:21,956 --> 00:54:26,120
so blow out the horse hockey
and remember what I taught you.

754
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:32,663
Blockers in the centre, funnelling, aim low
and will someone catch a goddamned ball?

755
00:54:32,758 --> 00:54:37,466
It's like watching a bunch of retards
trying to fuck a doorknob out there.

756
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:41,504
Get it together.
Let's play some dodgeball.

757
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,510
Hands in.

758
00:54:43,603 --> 00:54:45,679
One, two, three, Joe's.

759
00:54:47,355 --> 00:54:49,597
- Average Joe's ready?
- Yes.

760
00:54:49,691 --> 00:54:51,849
Lumberjacks, ready?

761
00:54:51,943 --> 00:54:52,975
Dodgeball.

762
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,652
Average Joe's has a tough job,
facing the Lumberjacks.

763
00:54:56,739 --> 00:55:00,323
These woodsmen probably haven't
even smelt a woman in eight months.

764
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,246
They must masturbate a lot, Cotton.

765
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:06,033
- Clean hit. You're out.
- In the deer gut.

766
00:55:06,123 --> 00:55:09,125
- Average Joe's looking tough.
- Yes.

767
00:55:14,173 --> 00:55:16,843
There's a souvenir for a lucky fan.

768
00:55:19,095 --> 00:55:23,922
Timber. Peter La Fleur nails him.
That's all she wrote, folks.

769
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:28,263
Average Joe's does some clear-cutting of
their own and moves onto the quarterfinal.

770
00:55:30,398 --> 00:55:33,232
Globo Gym hoping to drop an A-bomb
on the Kamikazes.

771
00:55:33,317 --> 00:55:36,900
I don't know how they can play
in diapers, Cotton. I never could.

772
00:55:36,988 --> 00:55:38,363
Peekaboo.

773
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:41,649
White Goodman, employing
his patented peekaboo-style attack,

774
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:45,193
tells Suzuki Toyota Oshinawa this is my dojo.

775
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:50,034
Is he gonna feel it tomorrow?
Right in his beak.

776
00:55:50,126 --> 00:55:55,083
A relentless Globo Gym attack led by
their Lilliputian leader, White Goodman.

777
00:55:55,172 --> 00:55:58,257
It's gotta be the hair. It's beautiful.

778
00:55:58,342 --> 00:56:02,802
Feathered and lethal.
You just don't see it nowadays.

779
00:56:04,013 --> 00:56:10,016
Globo Gym says, "Domo arigato, Mr Roboto",
and breezes into the semifinals.

780
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:15,938
Skillz That Killz, ready?
Average Joe's, ready? Dodgeball.

781
00:56:16,026 --> 00:56:19,441
Average Joe's planning
to playa hate Skillz That Killz,

782
00:56:19,528 --> 00:56:21,936
the inner-city champs for five years straight.

783
00:56:22,031 --> 00:56:26,741
Skillz might be looking past Average Joe's,
doing more dancing than dodgeballing.

784
00:56:26,828 --> 00:56:30,410
They better check themselves
before they wreck themselves.

785
00:56:30,498 --> 00:56:35,706
Right you are, partner.
Great catch. La Fleur wheels and fires.

786
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:39,250
Winner. Average Joe's.

787
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:44,251
And Average Joe's, not blinded by the
bling-bling, advances to the semifinal.

788
00:56:46,764 --> 00:56:51,391
Globo Gym's making mincemeat
of the Las Vegas Police Department.

789
00:56:51,477 --> 00:56:53,221
That's gotta hurt.

790
00:56:55,355 --> 00:56:57,264
B-b-b-bull's-eye.

791
00:56:57,357 --> 00:56:59,682
Winner. Globo Gym.

792
00:56:59,776 --> 00:57:04,853
Sportsmanship be darned.
Globo Gym hands the Las Vegas Police a 187,

793
00:57:04,948 --> 00:57:07,522
and they're going to the finals.

794
00:57:10,037 --> 00:57:14,330
The Poughkeepsie State Flying Cougars
are all over Average Joe's today.

795
00:57:14,415 --> 00:57:19,790
It just doesn't look good for 'em. The winner
of this match faces Globo Gym in the finals.

796
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,956
Right in the testicles.

797
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:24,586
Ouch-Town. Population: you, bro.

798
00:57:24,676 --> 00:57:27,843
Average Joe's down to their final two players.

799
00:57:29,139 --> 00:57:31,381
La Fleur can't hold on.
He's gotta sit down.

800
00:57:31,475 --> 00:57:34,474
- Time out. Gordy.
- Time out. Time out.

801
00:57:35,102 --> 00:57:36,513
Time. Time is out.

802
00:57:36,604 --> 00:57:40,602
It looks like the clock is about to
strike midnight on this Cinderella story,

803
00:57:40,692 --> 00:57:43,396
turning Average Joe's
into the proverbial pumpkin.

804
00:57:43,486 --> 00:57:45,977
I sure do like pumpkins, Cotton.

805
00:57:47,407 --> 00:57:50,940
You won't hit 'em. They're too good,
and you suck somethin' awful.

806
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:54,700
- Yes, sir. I do.
- Our only shot is for you to get angry.

807
00:57:54,788 --> 00:57:58,489
- Roger that. OK.
- All right. Hands in.

808
00:57:58,584 --> 00:58:00,991
- One, two, three.
- Joe's.

809
00:58:01,837 --> 00:58:04,922
You gotta get angry. Get angry now.

810
00:58:05,007 --> 00:58:09,751
Gordon Pibb, alone, facing five Cougars.
It's all over but the crying.

811
00:58:09,844 --> 00:58:13,379
Sayonara, aufWiedersehen and goodbye.

812
00:58:26,654 --> 00:58:30,104
- Dodgeball.
- Let the dodgeball slaughter begin.

813
00:58:30,198 --> 00:58:32,107
Good deflection there.

814
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,442
Hang on. And another one.

815
00:58:34,536 --> 00:58:37,109
Three balls at once. Who knew?

816
00:58:37,622 --> 00:58:40,160
Four on one.
Pibb won't go down without a fight.

817
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,658
That's it.

818
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:45,871
- You're kidding me.
- He's callin' 'em out.

819
00:58:46,714 --> 00:58:48,790
Now it's two on one. Who'd have thunk it?

820
00:58:48,883 --> 00:58:53,795
- Go, you crazy son of a bitch. Go.
- He's on the warpath.

821
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:58,553
Incredible. It's one on one.

822
00:58:58,643 --> 00:59:02,475
- I can't believe it.
- It's just not believable, Cotton.

823
00:59:10,654 --> 00:59:11,686
Winner.

824
00:59:12,031 --> 00:59:15,234
Average Joe's wins.

825
00:59:15,325 --> 00:59:20,403
They are going to the finals
to play Globo Gym for $50,000.

826
00:59:20,498 --> 00:59:24,364
- That'll buy one heck of a pumpkin.
- Right you are, Pep.

827
00:59:24,459 --> 00:59:26,950
I never would have dreamed it possible.

828
00:59:27,045 --> 00:59:31,671
But with seven-time ADAA All-Star
Patches O'Houlihan at the helm,

829
00:59:31,758 --> 00:59:34,593
I guess it must be the luck of the lrish.

830
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:42,719
Tomorrow we're gonna pecker-slap
those Globo Gym bastards.

831
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:43,592
Yeah.

832
00:59:43,686 --> 00:59:48,230
- You really think we can beat Globo Gym?
- As long as we got Patches, we got a shot.

833
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,485
My God.

834
00:59:57,409 --> 01:00:01,405
Well, it's probably the way
he would have wanted to go.

835
01:00:01,495 --> 01:00:04,911
- What?
- What are we gonna do without Patches?

836
01:00:04,999 --> 01:00:07,158
We're gonna get our taints handed to us.

837
01:00:07,252 --> 01:00:10,335
- What's a taint?
- I dunno. Sounds bad.

838
01:00:11,547 --> 01:00:14,833
Maybe you should
go say something to the guys.

839
01:00:14,926 --> 01:00:16,089
Yeah.

840
01:00:16,177 --> 01:00:22,796
They don't make a "sorry your coach just got
crushed by two tons of irony" Hallmark card.

841
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:26,924
I'll be right back.

842
01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:39,156
What?

843
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:44,448
We're opening a new Globo Gym in Mexico
City. I've been boning up on my Spanish.

844
01:00:46,623 --> 01:00:50,075
Me'Shell was having some digestive
problems. I hope you don't mind.

845
01:00:50,169 --> 01:00:52,458
Will you shut that?

846
01:00:52,546 --> 01:00:55,214
For all of us, baby.

847
01:00:57,884 --> 01:01:03,720
So that's the deal. I give you $100,000,
you sign over the deed to your gym.

848
01:01:03,806 --> 01:01:05,550
Period.

849
01:01:05,642 --> 01:01:07,800
End o'story.

850
01:01:07,894 --> 01:01:13,231
You really think you can come here and buy
me out, you're a lot dumber than I thought.

851
01:01:13,315 --> 01:01:18,939
Oh, I don't think I'm a lot dumber than you
thought I'd think that I thought I was once.

852
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:22,232
Look, Peter, I know what it's like.

853
01:01:22,324 --> 01:01:26,951
Really. For all our blustery back-and-forth,
we're really pretty much the same guy.

854
01:01:27,038 --> 01:01:30,739
We're both leaders. And I like
what you've done with the gym over there.

855
01:01:30,834 --> 01:01:35,744
I love the whole "I'm not OK, you're not OK,
but that's OK" thing you got going.

856
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:39,172
"You can be fat as long as
you're happy inside." It works.

857
01:01:39,258 --> 01:01:42,709
And they love you. Whoo, do they love you.

858
01:01:42,803 --> 01:01:44,796
You're their Fonzie, Pete.

859
01:01:44,889 --> 01:01:47,178
"Hey." Right?

860
01:01:49,269 --> 01:01:54,854
But do you really think it's fair for them
to put all that pressure on you? All the time?

861
01:01:55,816 --> 01:01:59,149
Looking to you to solve their every problem?

862
01:01:59,235 --> 01:02:00,860
I mean, come on.

863
01:02:00,946 --> 01:02:05,110
I know you. You know you.

864
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,235
And I know you know that I know you.

865
01:02:08,327 --> 01:02:10,818
You're heading for a fall, Pete.

866
01:02:10,913 --> 01:02:14,413
Sooner or later, Average Joe's is gonna close.

867
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:18,664
And when it does, they're gonna blame you.

868
01:02:20,256 --> 01:02:24,254
I don't know if you've ever seen $100,000,
except maybe in the movies.

869
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:28,257
But I assure you,
something gets lost in the translation.

870
01:02:31,267 --> 01:02:35,395
Money. $100,000. Dodgeball game.

871
01:02:37,189 --> 01:02:39,016
Take the money.

872
01:02:39,734 --> 01:02:44,610
Invest it in something.
Give it to charity, I don't care.

873
01:02:51,495 --> 01:02:53,654
Just sign the contract.

874
01:02:59,086 --> 01:03:02,087
Come on, guys. We got Peter.

875
01:03:02,173 --> 01:03:06,335
And they got guys named Laser and Blazer
and Taser, and all kinds of asers.

876
01:03:06,426 --> 01:03:09,961
Gar. Steve's gotta go drain the sea monster.

877
01:03:11,098 --> 01:03:13,255
Here. Justin, your virgin daiquiri.

878
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:15,923
- Thanks, Ms Veatch.
- Nothing for me.

879
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:20,267
- Dwight says we'll get killed out there, Peter.
- Let's not talk about tomorrow.

880
01:03:20,357 --> 01:03:23,855
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. It's a little complicated.

881
01:03:23,943 --> 01:03:27,110
- But what do you think we should do?
- Yeah. Come on, tell us.

882
01:03:27,196 --> 01:03:28,442
What's the plan?

883
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:31,781
What do you guys want from me?
I don't have a plan for you.

884
01:03:31,867 --> 01:03:36,080
We're gonna play Globo Gym tomorrow
and we're probably gonna lose.

885
01:03:36,164 --> 01:03:41,833
It's the truth. The sooner you guys get that
through your head, the easier this will all be.

886
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:45,827
Jesus Christ.

887
01:03:46,299 --> 01:03:48,457
He didn't mean that.

888
01:03:48,551 --> 01:03:52,798
- Is he being serious?
- He's probably just stressed out.

889
01:03:52,888 --> 01:03:55,759
I've never seen him like that.

890
01:03:57,852 --> 01:04:01,683
Gar, matey, where are you headed? Peter...

891
01:04:01,772 --> 01:04:04,345
You are not a pirate.

892
01:04:12,032 --> 01:04:16,695
OK, guys. Let's get out of here
and get some rest for tomorrow, right?

893
01:04:24,336 --> 01:04:26,209
Dwight...

894
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:31,338
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
I'm gonna have a bathroom... go to the drink...

895
01:04:31,426 --> 01:04:33,218
in the bathroom.

896
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:35,923
Whatever you do, wash your hands.

897
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,985
Excuse me, miss. I was wondering if...

898
01:04:49,068 --> 01:04:51,607
You are the one who stares at me.

899
01:04:51,696 --> 01:04:54,067
Why is this?

900
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:58,783
Because I think you're
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

901
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,575
Watch it, freak.

902
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:22,714
Go back to Treasure lsland.

903
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:25,265
Fag.

904
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,430
Screw you.

905
01:05:39,742 --> 01:05:43,610
Katie, bar the door.
It's time for the championship match

906
01:05:43,705 --> 01:05:46,113
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

907
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:50,251
We've seen it all here, folks.
Grit, determination, incontinence.

908
01:05:50,336 --> 01:05:52,909
And it's all come down to this -
a Cinderella story.

909
01:05:53,005 --> 01:05:57,798
Average Joe's Gymnasium hopes to
drive their vorpal blade snicker-snack

910
01:05:57,886 --> 01:06:01,930
into the heart of the dodgeball Jabberwocky
that is the Globo Gym Purple Cobras,

911
01:06:02,015 --> 01:06:05,847
and walk away with $50,000
in stone-cold cash.

912
01:06:05,936 --> 01:06:10,062
Hello, everybody, and welcome
to what you've all been waiting for.

913
01:06:10,147 --> 01:06:13,979
A David-and-Goliath story
truer than the Bible itself.

914
01:06:14,068 --> 01:06:18,196
The championship dodgeball match
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

915
01:06:20,908 --> 01:06:22,616
Peter?

916
01:06:24,954 --> 01:06:26,577
Peter?

917
01:06:26,663 --> 01:06:29,236
Hello?

918
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:30,661
Peter?

919
01:06:30,751 --> 01:06:33,586
Come on, everybody headed down...

920
01:06:43,097 --> 01:06:45,004
So what happens on a double fault?

921
01:06:45,097 --> 01:06:50,472
On a double fault you go to sudden-death
elimination. It's Continuation Rule 113-D.

922
01:06:50,562 --> 01:06:53,313
- Whatever.
- Hey, guys, wait up.

923
01:06:57,319 --> 01:06:58,730
Justin.

924
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:02,982
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- Really? I mean, why? What's up?

925
01:07:03,073 --> 01:07:07,237
Derek fell off the roller coaster
and broke every bone in his body.

926
01:07:07,328 --> 01:07:08,787
My God, that's awful.

927
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:12,454
We were the centre Kewpie. With no
centre Kewpie we can't do our routine.

928
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:15,578
- No. I'm sorry.
- You gotta do it.

929
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,330
What?

930
01:07:17,422 --> 01:07:19,498
No, no, no, no, no. I can't.

931
01:07:19,591 --> 01:07:23,457
Please. You are the only one in Las Vegas
who knows our routine.

932
01:07:23,552 --> 01:07:29,139
- The dodgeball championship's at noon.
- You'll be back in time. I promise.

933
01:07:32,186 --> 01:07:33,846
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes.

934
01:07:33,938 --> 01:07:36,061
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No. No time.

935
01:07:36,148 --> 01:07:37,809
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No time.

936
01:07:39,692 --> 01:07:44,687
Average Joe's are a 50-1 underdog here today.
No one is giving them much of a chance.

937
01:07:44,781 --> 01:07:46,608
What do you think, Pep?

938
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,858
I spoke to White Goodman before the match

939
01:07:48,952 --> 01:07:54,077
and he told me that his team
really wants to win this one.

940
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:57,582
Right. And the stage is set for
Darwin's cruellest play to unfold.

941
01:07:57,668 --> 01:08:01,453
So don't go anywhere, folks.
The Schadenfreude is about to begin.

942
01:08:01,547 --> 01:08:05,877
- I don't understand. Why would Peter leave?
- He knows we're gonna get killed.

943
01:08:05,969 --> 01:08:11,260
Hey. That's not true. I don't know why Peter
left, but we can do this without him.

944
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:14,553
We just have to figure it out.
Owen, you'll have to play.

945
01:08:14,645 --> 01:08:18,059
- OK, yeah.
- Great. But we'll still be two players short.

946
01:08:18,147 --> 01:08:22,275
We're still missing the teenage love-puppy
and Steve the Pirate.

947
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,816
Who's Steve the Pirate?

948
01:08:24,904 --> 01:08:28,771
The only guy on our team
who dresses like a pirate.

949
01:08:28,866 --> 01:08:33,030
Wait. There's a guy on our team
dressed like a pirate?

950
01:08:34,621 --> 01:08:42,368
And now, let's hear it for the West Davenport
High School Charging Donkeys.

951
01:08:42,463 --> 01:08:44,538
Donkeys.

952
01:09:09,156 --> 01:09:10,781
Go, Donkeys.

953
01:09:13,618 --> 01:09:16,654
- We did it.
- Holy cow. My God.

954
01:09:16,746 --> 01:09:20,116
- It was perfect. You were perfect.
- God, I gotta go.

955
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:22,496
Wait. Aren't you gonna stay for the trophy?

956
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:25,373
I'm sorry, Amber. I got my own trophy to win.

957
01:09:42,104 --> 01:09:44,596
Now I'm going.

958
01:09:49,611 --> 01:09:54,357
Here come the Purple Cobras,
led by White Goodman. All business.

959
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:58,032
We haven't seen Average Joe's yet.
They haven't made it to the court.

960
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,655
It could be a psychological ploy,
or something worse.

961
01:10:01,749 --> 01:10:06,162
They're definitely not on the court, Cotton.
Their absence is noticeable.

962
01:10:06,254 --> 01:10:11,045
We'll be right back
after these words from our sponsors...

963
01:10:12,718 --> 01:10:15,043
Can I get a bottle of water?

964
01:10:17,555 --> 01:10:19,881
Aren't you Peter La Fleur?

965
01:10:20,934 --> 01:10:24,683
- Lance Armstrong?
- Yeah, that's me. But I'm a big fan of yours.

966
01:10:24,772 --> 01:10:28,638
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been watching the dodgeball.

967
01:10:28,733 --> 01:10:33,728
I just can't get enough of it. I'm really pullin'
for you against those jerks from Globo Gym.

968
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:37,780
I think you better hurry up
or you're gonna be late.

969
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:42,364
- Actually, I decided to quit, Lance.
- Quit?

970
01:10:43,207 --> 01:10:49,326
Once I thought of quittin', when I had brain,
lung and testicular cancer at the same time.

971
01:10:50,046 --> 01:10:52,832
But with the support of my friends
I got back on the bike

972
01:10:52,923 --> 01:10:55,628
and I won the Tour de France
five times in a row.

973
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:59,763
But I'm sure you have a good reason to quit.

974
01:10:59,848 --> 01:11:03,381
What are you dying from
that's keepin' you from the finals?

975
01:11:03,475 --> 01:11:07,687
Right now, it feels a little bit like shame.

976
01:11:07,771 --> 01:11:13,607
If people never quit when the going got tough
they'd have nothing to regret all their lives.

977
01:11:13,694 --> 01:11:18,689
Good luck to you, Peter. I'm sure
this decision won't haunt you forever.

978
01:11:25,163 --> 01:11:29,244
Steve? Steve the Pirate? "Scurvy."

979
01:11:29,335 --> 01:11:33,546
- No. Not ringing any bells.
- Forget it, man.

980
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:37,925
We'll play with four people. It's not
an advantage. Can't you bend the rules?

981
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:42,386
There's nothing I can do. Rules are rules.
You don't have enough players.

982
01:11:42,471 --> 01:11:46,517
Inform the committee and Mr Goodman
about Average Joe's forfeit.

983
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:49,886
- Yes, sir.
- Better luck next year.

984
01:11:51,564 --> 01:11:53,142
Excuse me.

985
01:11:53,233 --> 01:11:56,685
Sorry I'm late. You won't believe
what just happened. Hey, guys.

986
01:11:56,778 --> 01:11:59,564
You're just in time to help us forfeit.

987
01:11:59,655 --> 01:12:01,731
Forfeit? Why?

988
01:12:03,618 --> 01:12:06,820
Well, I don't know what to tell you, but...

989
01:12:06,912 --> 01:12:10,957
Yes, I'm being told that Average Joe's
does not have enough players

990
01:12:11,042 --> 01:12:13,996
and will be forfeiting
the championship match.

991
01:12:14,087 --> 01:12:17,170
It's a bold strategy, Cotton.
Let's see if it pays off for 'em.

992
01:12:17,255 --> 01:12:22,962
To the tournament floor we go, for the sceptre
presentation from the Dodgeball Chancellor.

993
01:12:23,053 --> 01:12:26,837
Ladies and gentlemen,
by the power vested in me

994
01:12:26,932 --> 01:12:32,175
by our governing body, the American
Dodgeball Association of America,

995
01:12:32,271 --> 01:12:36,979
and in concurrence with our sponsors,
Lumber Liquidators and Omaha Steaks,

996
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:39,225
it gives me great pleasure

997
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:44,230
to declare the winner of this year's
Las Vegas lnternational Tournament to be...

998
01:12:44,324 --> 01:12:46,566
Wait. He's here.

999
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,825
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

1000
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:56,039
We're ready to play, Your Honour.

1001
01:12:56,127 --> 01:13:01,086
Too late. Your lovable band of losers already
forfeited. The trophy and money are mine.

1002
01:13:01,174 --> 01:13:04,673
He's right. The team already forfeited.
There's nothing you can do.

1003
01:13:04,761 --> 01:13:07,430
Facial, La Fleur. Total facial.

1004
01:13:08,598 --> 01:13:10,472
Actually, that's not true.

1005
01:13:10,559 --> 01:13:14,851
The committee can overrule the chancellor -
that's you, sir - by a two-thirds vote.

1006
01:13:14,937 --> 01:13:17,262
He's right. He's right. It's a bylaw.

1007
01:13:19,442 --> 01:13:22,063
- It's a bylaw.
- What's a bylaw?

1008
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:26,653
- Hang on a second here, folks.
- Let them play.

1009
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:30,654
We might just have a championship game yet.

1010
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:33,828
Listen to this crowd.

1011
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:36,120
Unbelievable.

1012
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:41,546
Pepper, it's clear what the crowd wants, but
the committee members have the final say.

1013
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:44,881
And it looks like they've come to a decision.

1014
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,753
Joe's needs two "yes" votes to play.

1015
01:13:47,843 --> 01:13:51,260
- There's a thumbs-up. Good news for Joe's.
- Please.

1016
01:13:51,347 --> 01:13:54,551
- Let's see how our second judge votes.
- Thank you.

1017
01:13:54,643 --> 01:14:01,808
Oh, tough sledding there. It's all even. Their
fate hangs on the thumb of our final judge.

1018
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:05,400
Thumbs up. Average Joe's can play.

1019
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:08,771
That is pure poppycock.
You're gonna let them do that?

1020
01:14:08,864 --> 01:14:12,364
- Thank you, Chuck Norris.
- Thank you, Peter.

1021
01:14:14,162 --> 01:14:17,827
All right, captains. Shake hands,
and let's have a clean match.

1022
01:14:17,915 --> 01:14:19,992
Good luck, White.

1023
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:24,704
Cram it up your cramhole, La Fleur.

1024
01:14:24,796 --> 01:14:28,248
Prepare to be humiliated on cable television.

1025
01:14:28,342 --> 01:14:30,418
Whatever.

1026
01:14:32,388 --> 01:14:35,591
- Nice of you to show up.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

1027
01:14:35,683 --> 01:14:38,600
What? I got a plan.

1028
01:14:40,521 --> 01:14:46,559
Let's play smart. Wait for two-on-ones. Cover
closely for your pick-ups. What's our motto?

1029
01:14:46,651 --> 01:14:48,858
- "Aim low".
- That's right.

1030
01:14:48,946 --> 01:14:51,946
All I'm asking is that
you give it your best for Patches.

1031
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:56,326
I say we go out there, let it all hang loose,
try to have some fun.

1032
01:14:56,411 --> 01:14:59,081
I mean, it's only dodgeball, right?

1033
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:03,208
- Put 'em in. One, two, three.
- Joe's.

1034
01:15:26,858 --> 01:15:29,146
Globo Gym, ready?

1035
01:15:29,235 --> 01:15:32,152
Average Joe's, ready?

1036
01:15:34,449 --> 01:15:35,445
Dodgeball.

1037
01:15:35,533 --> 01:15:40,989
Championship match is under way.
Average Joe's versus the Globo Gym Goliath.

1038
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:45,041
Quick elimination there for Kate Veatch.

1039
01:15:46,377 --> 01:15:49,627
White Goodman's hit,
but that ball's up for grabs. And...

1040
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:51,671
- It's caught.
- That's a catch.

1041
01:15:51,757 --> 01:15:55,340
- You're out, La Fleur.
- Peter La Fleur has gotta sit down.

1042
01:15:55,428 --> 01:15:58,677
And Joe's has lost
their two best players early.

1043
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,214
Dwight Baumgarten still playing hard.

1044
01:16:01,308 --> 01:16:03,977
Hits Me'Shell Jones right on the dome.

1045
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:06,053
You're mine next time.

1046
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:14,395
Right in the tokus.
2-1, ese, and Globo Gym is dominating.

1047
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:20,905
- Hi.
- Hey.

1048
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:25,574
- You're out.
- I don't know what that was,

1049
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:30,458
but it leaves Joe's on the wrong side
of a 4-2 advantage.

1050
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:33,580
Joe's gets an elimination. It's two on three.

1051
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,297
Get out.

1052
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,755
Gordo. Lose your temper. Get mad.

1053
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:43,884
White Goodman with a catch. Gordon Pibb
goes out, Me'Shell Jones comes back in.

1054
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:45,766
You're out, four-eyes.

1055
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:50,313
Well, it's all up to Average Joe's youngest
member. He's gotta make a play here, Pepper.

1056
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:52,105
Word, Cotton.

1057
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:57,565
Four Cobras and one Joe. Even a rabid
mongoose wouldn't have a chance now.

1058
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:00,407
- Nice dodge.
- Stay alive. Stay alive.

1059
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:04,900
They're just toying with the young man now.

1060
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,950
He's gotta avoid getting hit. That's the key.

1061
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,868
Justin, let's go.

1062
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:12,626
What a great catch.

1063
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:16,080
And another.
Peter La Fleur comes back into the game.

1064
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:20,217
Just like that, a three-player swing.
Joe's isn't done yet.

1065
01:17:20,301 --> 01:17:21,926
Justin.

1066
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:24,585
I love you.

1067
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,591
I love you t...

1068
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,347
Joanie loves Chachi.

1069
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:33,184
Two players left on each side.
What a match. What a sport.

1070
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:39,520
Throw out the rule book, folks,
it's down and dirty now. Street dodgeball.

1071
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:45,071
Look out. La Fleur goes down -
he's a sitting duck.

1072
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:56,332
How about that, folks? Kate Veatch takes the
bullet for Peter La Fleur. Now that's sacrifice.

1073
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:01,379
As touching a moment as we've seen
on the dodgeball court all tournament.

1074
01:18:02,176 --> 01:18:04,846
A blatant cheap shot from White Goodman.

1075
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:09,637
- That's court misconduct. That's a warning.
- Come on. Gimme a break.

1076
01:18:10,768 --> 01:18:12,310
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1077
01:18:12,394 --> 01:18:14,885
- Jesus. Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

1078
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:18,147
- It was an accident. I thought she was in play.
- Not a chance.

1079
01:18:18,233 --> 01:18:21,270
We're sweating like greased monkeys.
I can't hold on to a ball.

1080
01:18:21,362 --> 01:18:24,611
Sorry, miss, but you're out.
You gotta get off the court.

1081
01:18:24,697 --> 01:18:26,489
Watch him, man.

1082
01:18:26,574 --> 01:18:28,900
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah?

1083
01:18:28,994 --> 01:18:30,785
Kick his ass.

1084
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:34,538
- Here's the restart.
- Players, to your positions.

1085
01:18:34,624 --> 01:18:39,121
Looks like it's gonna be a two-on-one,
a menage a trois of pain.

1086
01:18:39,213 --> 01:18:42,960
Usually you pay double
for that kind of action, Cotton.

1087
01:18:44,926 --> 01:18:48,675
You're playing ready dodgeball.
Balls are at your feet.

1088
01:18:48,763 --> 01:18:51,089
Ready? Dodgeball.

1089
01:18:51,183 --> 01:18:56,307
It's a cat-and-mouse game, folks.
Peter La Fleur has gotta wait for his shot.

1090
01:18:59,775 --> 01:19:02,311
He gets the elimination.

1091
01:19:03,527 --> 01:19:09,282
My. Globo Gym wins.
A Cinderella story cast asunder.

1092
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:13,495
Average Joe's has come all this way
for nothing. Absolutely nothing.

1093
01:19:13,579 --> 01:19:16,331
They're not gonna get anything, Cotton.

1094
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:21,627
No elimination. Double fault.
You stepped over the line on the throw.

1095
01:19:21,711 --> 01:19:25,757
What? You gotta be out of your mind.
That is the worst call I've ever seen.

1096
01:19:25,841 --> 01:19:30,218
I'm out here busting my butt and you come in
with a bush-league call like that? Bullcrap.

1097
01:19:30,304 --> 01:19:35,346
ADAA Continuation Rule 113-D, sir.
Sudden death.

1098
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:36,893
All right. Bring it.

1099
01:19:36,978 --> 01:19:40,428
I don't believe it, folks. Sudden death.

1100
01:19:40,522 --> 01:19:42,265
Well, let me tell you,

1101
01:19:42,357 --> 01:19:48,193
a double-fault final-play elimination hasn't
occurred since the Helsinki episode of 1919,

1102
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:51,031
and I think we all remember
how that turned out.

1103
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:57,782
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the greatest
happening in sport. Sudden-death dodgeball.

1104
01:19:57,872 --> 01:20:00,280
Pepper needs new shorts.

1105
01:20:02,293 --> 01:20:05,543
White, Peter, this is sudden death.

1106
01:20:06,005 --> 01:20:11,593
Only striking an opposing player eliminates
them. Catching the ball does nothing.

1107
01:20:11,678 --> 01:20:15,674
Both feet must remain
in the triangle at all times.

1108
01:20:15,764 --> 01:20:20,474
You may throw any time after my call.
Understood?

1109
01:20:21,395 --> 01:20:25,227
OK. Let's have a clean match.
Good luck, gentlemen.

1110
01:20:25,733 --> 01:20:28,651
This is it, La Loser.

1111
01:20:30,113 --> 01:20:33,812
You ready for the hurricane?

1112
01:20:34,908 --> 01:20:38,657
Just don't go cryin' to mama when
I spank you in front of all these people.

1113
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:44,871
You don't go crying to your daddy
after I wipe it up with your face.

1114
01:20:46,503 --> 01:20:49,421
- White?
- Yeah?

1115
01:20:49,507 --> 01:20:54,132
- You look awful fat in those pants.
- Players, to your positions.

1116
01:20:54,219 --> 01:20:58,003
This is about gamesmanship.
Throw early and you're defenceless.

1117
01:20:58,098 --> 01:21:04,183
Throw late and you're eliminated.
Dilemma, thy name is dodgeball.

1118
01:21:04,271 --> 01:21:07,391
This sport doesn't build character,
it reveals it.

1119
01:21:07,483 --> 01:21:10,565
Effin' A, Cotton. Effin' A.

1120
01:21:12,403 --> 01:21:14,479
Come on, talk to me.

1121
01:21:16,074 --> 01:21:18,316
Listen up, crotch stain.

1122
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:22,787
Remember your training
and trust your instincts.

1123
01:21:22,872 --> 01:21:25,660
You can do it. I believe in you.

1124
01:21:28,585 --> 01:21:30,377
Bye-bye.

1125
01:21:30,462 --> 01:21:31,494
Right.

1126
01:21:31,588 --> 01:21:34,506
Players, turn and step in.

1127
01:21:50,273 --> 01:21:52,847
What the hell's he doing?

1128
01:21:52,943 --> 01:21:55,564
I don't know.

1129
01:21:57,698 --> 01:21:58,943
Get a load of this guy.

1130
01:21:59,032 --> 01:22:02,817
In 23 years of broadcasting
I thought I'd seen it all, folks.

1131
01:22:02,912 --> 01:22:06,825
But it looks like Peter La Fleur
has actually blindfolded himself.

1132
01:22:06,914 --> 01:22:09,702
He will not be able to see very well, Cotton.

1133
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:21,835
Ready?

1134
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:29,098
Dodgeball.

1135
01:22:35,109 --> 01:22:37,398
Goodbye, Peter.

1136
01:22:37,487 --> 01:22:40,322
I always knew you were weak.

1137
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:46,613
Air Goodman, comin' at ya.

1138
01:22:54,462 --> 01:22:57,582
Down goes Goodman.
Down goes Goodman.

1139
01:22:57,674 --> 01:23:01,006
Winner. Average Joe's.

1140
01:23:04,471 --> 01:23:08,172
Do you believe in unlikelihoods?

1141
01:23:08,267 --> 01:23:11,517
Average Joe's shocking the dodgeball world

1142
01:23:11,603 --> 01:23:15,815
and upsetting Globo Gym
in the championship match.

1143
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,275
Unbelievable.

1144
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:21,819
I have been to the Great Wall of China.
I have seen the Pyramids of Egypt.

1145
01:23:21,904 --> 01:23:24,526
I've even witnessed a grown man
satisfy a camel.

1146
01:23:24,616 --> 01:23:26,941
But never in all my years as a sportscaster

1147
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:32,195
have I witnessed something as improbable,
as impossible, as what we've witnessed here.

1148
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:37,081
The little team that could, Average Joe's
Gymnasium, underdogs throughout,

1149
01:23:37,169 --> 01:23:42,045
stand before us, aglow,
as true dodgeball champions.

1150
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:46,794
On behalf of the American Dodgeball
Association of America,

1151
01:23:46,887 --> 01:23:51,384
it is my honour to present to you
this cheque for $50,000.

1152
01:23:57,648 --> 01:24:00,732
What are you so happy about, La Fleur?
None of this matters.

1153
01:24:00,818 --> 01:24:05,314
You signed your gym over to me last night,
remember? You lost, I won.

1154
01:24:05,405 --> 01:24:07,564
Suck failure, freaks.

1155
01:24:07,658 --> 01:24:10,909
Peter, is that true?

1156
01:24:10,995 --> 01:24:12,988
Yeah, it's true.

1157
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:16,413
It's true I sold Average Joe's to White.

1158
01:24:16,499 --> 01:24:18,955
It's true that every man has his price.

1159
01:24:19,044 --> 01:24:24,038
And it's also true that money won
is a lot sweeter than money earned.

1160
01:24:24,132 --> 01:24:28,510
- Now he's a philosophiser.
- Excuse us. Step aside, please.

1161
01:24:29,638 --> 01:24:32,044
Your winnings, Mr La Fleur.
Congratulations.

1162
01:24:32,139 --> 01:24:36,184
- Right on time. I appreciate it. Thank you.
- What is that? What winnings?

1163
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:40,931
Gosh, I totally forgot to tell you. I took the
$100,000 bribe that you gave me last night,

1164
01:24:41,023 --> 01:24:44,108
and I put it on us to win.
We were going off at 50-1.

1165
01:24:44,194 --> 01:24:47,610
Anyone? Top of your head?
What's 50 times $100,000?

1166
01:24:47,698 --> 01:24:49,109
$50,000?

1167
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:53,278
$5 million. Peter, are you kidding me?

1168
01:24:53,369 --> 01:24:55,527
Surprise.

1169
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:03,958
Stick it in your ear, La Fleur. I wouldn't sell
you your gym back for all King Midas's silver.

1170
01:25:04,047 --> 01:25:08,921
The gym is mine. So you can take your band
of yellow-bellied losers and crawl out of here.

1171
01:25:09,009 --> 01:25:11,963
You're right. I can't make you
sell Average Joe's to me.

1172
01:25:12,054 --> 01:25:15,886
So I guess I'll just take your advice
and invest in something.

1173
01:25:15,975 --> 01:25:20,221
- Say the controlling stake of Globo Gym.
- That's preposterous. I'd never allow it.

1174
01:25:20,312 --> 01:25:24,097
Globo Gym is a publicly traded company.
There's nothing you can do about it.

1175
01:25:24,191 --> 01:25:29,647
So I would control Globo Gym
and everything that Globo Gym owns,

1176
01:25:29,737 --> 01:25:33,902
which, as of last night, is Average Joe's Gym.

1177
01:25:35,285 --> 01:25:36,743
I'm your new boss, White.

1178
01:25:36,828 --> 01:25:40,244
You can't be my boss. Nobody can.
I'm my own boss. I created myself.

1179
01:25:40,332 --> 01:25:43,536
- You're fired, pal.
- You can't do anything to me.

1180
01:25:44,086 --> 01:25:47,169
You're going down, La Fleur,
like a sweet muffin.

1181
01:25:47,254 --> 01:25:50,873
- Another time, another time.
- You suck, La Fleur.

1182
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:54,836
Give me that.

1183
01:25:57,724 --> 01:26:00,297
Man, the blindfold was crazy.

1184
01:26:01,812 --> 01:26:04,431
Peter.

1185
01:26:04,521 --> 01:26:07,095
Look. It's Steve the Pirate.

1186
01:26:10,737 --> 01:26:15,944
I just wanted to tell you
that I thought about what you said, and

1187
01:26:16,993 --> 01:26:19,318
I guess you're right.

1188
01:26:19,412 --> 01:26:21,785
I'm not really a pirate.

1189
01:26:23,123 --> 01:26:25,696
I don't know, Steve.

1190
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,999
If you're not a pirate,

1191
01:26:28,087 --> 01:26:31,954
who the hell am I gonna split
all that buried treasure with?

1192
01:26:37,096 --> 01:26:38,970
Peter...

1193
01:26:39,056 --> 01:26:40,928
Gar, Steve.

1194
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,140
We missed you.

1195
01:26:51,151 --> 01:26:52,811
Hey, you.

1196
01:26:52,903 --> 01:26:54,979
Hey, you.

1197
01:26:56,699 --> 01:26:58,738
- Joyce?
- Kate.

1198
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:03,661
- I thought you were in Guam.
- I caught an early flight. I wouldn't miss this.

1199
01:27:03,746 --> 01:27:06,035
You are amazing.

1200
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:14,290
- I told you she was a lesbian.
- Wow. Good call.

1201
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,918
Hey. I'm not a lesbian.

1202
01:27:18,009 --> 01:27:19,670
You're not?

1203
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:21,304
No.

1204
01:27:21,388 --> 01:27:23,844
I'm bisexual.

1205
01:27:25,476 --> 01:27:27,385
Snap.

1206
01:27:27,978 --> 01:27:31,478
All right, everybody. Smile big.

1207
01:27:36,361 --> 01:27:40,276
Hi. I'm Peter La Fleur,
owner and operator of Average Joe's Gym.

1208
01:27:40,365 --> 01:27:44,031
I'm here to tell you
you're perfect just the way you are.

1209
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:49,825
But if you feel like losin' a few pounds, gettin'
healthier, and makin' friends in the process,

1210
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:51,744
Joe's is the place for you.

1211
01:27:51,836 --> 01:27:55,286
Don't forget that youth dodgeball classes
are forming right now.

1212
01:27:55,379 --> 01:28:00,256
So come on down and learn a great game the
way it's supposed to be played. Right, kids?

1213
01:28:00,343 --> 01:28:02,420
Right.

1214
01:28:11,939 --> 01:28:14,060
Spare me.

1215
01:28:14,148 --> 01:28:16,639
I won that tournament.

1216
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,155
Fucking Chuck Norris.

1217
01:28:24,242 --> 01:28:26,318

1219
01:31:27,712 --> 01:31:30,880
Yeah. I hope you're all happy now.

1220
01:31:30,966 --> 01:31:33,504
Good guy wins, bad guy loses.

1221
01:31:33,594 --> 01:31:36,166
Big friggin' surprise.

1222
01:31:37,263 --> 01:31:39,256
I love happy endings.

1223
01:31:42,269 --> 01:31:46,646
You know, that's the problem
with the American cinema.

1224
01:31:46,731 --> 01:31:49,222
Can't handle any complexity in it, you know?

1225
01:31:49,317 --> 01:31:53,529
"Don't make me think,
I just wanna be entertained."

1226
01:31:53,614 --> 01:31:55,521
All right, fine.

1227
01:31:55,614 --> 01:31:59,280
You want a little somethin'-somethin'
for the ride home?

1228
01:31:59,368 --> 01:32:01,860
Check these boots out for size.

1229
01:32:03,706 --> 01:32:05,912
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

1230
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,159
And they're like, "It's better than yours"

1231
01:32:08,253 --> 01:32:10,210
Damn right, it's better than yours

1232
01:32:10,297 --> 01:32:12,964
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge

1233
01:32:14,007 --> 01:32:18,171
What the boys go crazy for

1234
01:32:19,513 --> 01:32:20,676
They lose their minds

1235
01:32:20,765 --> 01:32:23,136
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

1236
01:32:23,225 --> 01:32:25,017
Damn right, it's better than yours

1237
01:32:25,102 --> 01:32:28,721
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge

1238
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:33,524
You happy? Fatty make a funny?

1239
01:32:34,305 --> 01:33:34,891

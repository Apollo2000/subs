2
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,124
1879. The Civil War is over,

3
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,628
and the resulting economic explosion
spurs the great migration west.

4
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:50,174
Farmers, ranchers, prospectors,
killers and thieves seek their fortunes.

5
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,178
Cattle drovers turn cow towns
into armed camps

6
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:59,726
with murder rates higher than those of
modern-day New York or Los Angeles.

7
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,146
Out of this chaos comes
legendary lawman Wyatt Earp,

8
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:07,608
retiring his badge and gun to start
a peaceful life with his family.

9
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:10,361
Earp's friend, John "Doc" Holliday,

10
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,697
a Southern gentleman
turned gunman and gambler,

11
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:17,910
also travels west, hoping the dry
climate will relieve his tuberculosis.

12
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,288
Silver is discovered in Arizona.

13
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,082
Tombstone becomes
queen of the boomtowns,

14
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:27,128
where the latest Paris fashions
are sold from the backs of wagons.

15
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,505
Attracted to this atmosphere of greed,

16
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,966
over 100 exiled Texas outlaws
band together

17
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,345
to form the ruthless gang recognised
by the red sashes they wear.

18
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,100
They emerge as the earliest example
of organised crime in America.

19
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,187
They call themselves the Cowboys.

20
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,282
Y'all killed two Cowboys.

21
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:55,732
Shoot.

22
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,652
Looks like we win.

23
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,668
Mexican police, huh?

24
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:22,467
Tell him to get on his knees.

25
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,813
He will not kneel, patr×£n.
He is very proud.

26
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,442
Hey, somebody get
this dick on his knees.

27
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:44,739
Good shot, Billy.

28
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:54,123
They call me Curly Bill Brocius.

29
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:59,629
I'm what you might call
the Founder of the Feast.

30
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:04,717
So next time we come,
you'd better step aside.

31
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:09,513
I ain't kiddin' neither.

32
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:24,070
Patr×£n, he say,
someone will come to revenge for him.

33
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:27,573
Something like a sick horse
who comes to sit with him.

34
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:29,409
He talk crazy.

35
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:33,663
That's not what he said,
ya ignorant wretch.

36
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:36,624
Your Spanish is worse
than your English.

37
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:41,087
You go to hell!

38
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:43,172
You first.

39
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:12,118
- Hell, let's eat, boys.
- Tamales are good, huh?

40
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:14,746
I guess they knew we were comin'.

41
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,354
Hey, Johnny,
what'd that Mexican mean,

42
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:43,107
"A sick horse is gonna get us"?

43
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:46,694
He's quoting the Bible,

44
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:48,696
Revelations.

45
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:55,327
"Behold, a pale horse.
The man who sat on him was Death."

46
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,165
"And Hell followed with him."

47
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:29,236
Move!

48
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:34,741
Come on! That's it! You move!

49
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:38,370
Stupid mule!

50
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,208
Come on! Come on, boy! Come on!

51
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:54,718
Hurts, don't it?

52
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:59,056
Now let go of that stud
and go on about your business.

53
00:08:11,695 --> 00:08:14,488
Mr Earp. My name's Dake.

54
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:17,199
Crawley Dake,
US Marshal for this territory.

55
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:20,077
- Forget it. I'm retired.
- Excuse me?

56
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,747
I said forget it.
I don't want the job, and that's final.

57
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:27,209
- I don't think you understand.
- No, you don't understand, Marshal.

58
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:31,297
I did my duty,
and now I'd like to get on with my life.

59
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:32,673
I'm going to Tombstone.

60
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:35,342
- I see. To strike it rich.
- Easy on the grain, Butch.

61
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,178
- Here you go.
- Well, all right, that's fine.

62
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:39,888
Tell you one thing, though.
Never saw a rich man

63
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:43,016
who didn't wind up
with a guilty conscience.

64
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,437
I already got a guilty conscience.
Might as well have the money too.

65
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:49,272
Good day now.

66
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:56,863
That's him, all right.
Boy, I'd know that sour face anywhere.

67
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,785
Virgil! Morgan! My God!

68
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:11,169
- Hey, boy! How are you, Morgan?
- Hi, Wyatt.

69
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:13,922
- Well, how do we look?
- Great, both of ya.

70
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:16,883
- Wyatt, you remember Allie.
- Good God. Well, he'd better.

71
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,052
Allie girl.

72
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:21,221
- And Louisa. Oh!
- Wyatt.

73
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:24,432
You're so lovely, darlin'.
I'm at your feet, just at your feet.

74
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:27,435
I guess it's only right.
Ma always said Morgan's the prettiest.

75
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,481
- Yeah, but she doted on the frowner.
- That's right.

76
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:34,025
- Wyatt.
- Mattie!

77
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:37,570
Mattie, they're already here.
Folks, this is Celia Ann.

78
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:40,073
- You can call her Mattie.
- Pleased to meet you, Mattie.

79
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:42,575
It's nice to meet you.

80
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,745
Well, Wyatt, I couldn't find a single
store that had laudanum anywhere.

81
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:49,332
That's all right, honey.
I sure been dreamin' about this.

82
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,919
God, since forever! Wait! Look here.

83
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:55,505
Go on up. Look. Huh?

84
00:09:58,842 --> 00:10:01,344
- Hey, Wyatt.
- Don't talk, just...

85
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:02,845
Yeah.

86
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,141
Thank you for this, Wyatt.

87
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:10,853
- It's all your doin'.
- We'll make our fortune, boys.

88
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,189
Well, come on.

89
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:15,692
Gracious. We could be sisters.

90
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:19,112
Mighty fine.
I wonder where he found her.

91
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:21,739
Same place we found ours, probably.

92
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,120
Matter, hon? Did you say
you needed some laudanum?

93
00:10:28,204 --> 00:10:30,872
- Yes, I did. Yes.
- I have some right here.

94
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:32,874
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

95
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:37,087
Just be careful now. It's full of hop.

96
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:39,923
Oh, don't worry.
I just get headaches sometimes.

97
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:42,926
Hey, Virg, see anything of Doc
while you were in Prescott?

98
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:45,929
Yeah. He had a streak
when we left, him and Kate.

99
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:48,765
I miss Doc. I miss that old rip.

100
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:52,227
- I don't.
- He makes me laugh.

101
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:02,029
That's $500, Holliday.
Are you in or out?

102
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:15,083
500. Must be a peach of a hand.

103
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:23,592
Oh, thank you, darlin'.

104
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:26,928
Kate! You're not wearing a bustle.

105
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:29,514
How lewd.

106
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:32,601
Come on, Holliday,
you in or out, goddamn it?

107
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:37,481
Why, Ed Bailey, you look like
you're just about ready to burst.

108
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:40,442
Come on! Come on, show!

109
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:45,238
Well, I suppose I'm deranged, but I...

110
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:48,825
I guess I'll just have to call.

111
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,036
Cover your ears, darlin'.

112
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:55,665
Isn't that a daisy?

113
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,543
Why, you son of a bitch!

114
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:00,587
Damn, Bailey, just settle down!

115
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:04,549
Shut up! Take your money and get out,

116
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:08,178
'cause I'm tired of
listenin' to your mouth.

117
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:10,889
Why, Ed Bailey,

118
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:12,557
are we cross?

119
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,936
Them guns don't scare me.

120
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,232
'Cause without them guns
you ain't nothin' but a skinny lunger.

121
00:12:21,316 --> 00:12:23,734
Ed, what an ugly thing to say.

122
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:29,156
I abhor ugliness. Does this mean
we're not friends any more?

123
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:33,411
You know, Ed, if I thought
you weren't my friend,

124
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:37,123
I just don't think I could bear it.

125
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:56,933
There. Now we can be friends again.

126
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:11,614
Touch that gun, I'll burn you down.

127
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,835
I calculate that's the end of this town.

128
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,047
I had a boy at the hotel pack us up.
The horse is outside.

129
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:31,843
So that's why you're
not wearin' a bustle.

130
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:37,348
My sweet, soft Hungarian devil.

131
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:43,313
Well!

132
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:50,528
Good evenin', then.

133
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:57,994
Let's not bother about the luggage.

134
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:24,080
Hey, Morg, pretty big, isn't it?

135
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:31,045
Oh-ho, brother, you can smell
the silver in this town.

136
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:36,384
- Easy.
- Look at these girls over here.

137
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,761
- Hi!
- Hello, girls!

138
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:41,431
Hot damn, this burg's jumpin'!

139
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:43,308
Here we go, ladies.

140
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,352
- Isn't that sweet?
- You can say that.

141
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:58,113
Sheriff.

142
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:08,749
Newcomers, eh?

143
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:12,878
The name's John Behan,
Cochise County Sheriff.

144
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:15,047
- Just hit town, did ya?
- Just this minute.

145
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:17,341
I'm Wyatt Earp, and these are
my brothers, Virgil and Morgan.

146
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:19,926
Wyatt Earp. Dodge City.

147
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:22,721
Gave all that up, Sheriff.
Goin' into business.

148
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:26,558
- Don't even carry a gun any more.
- Going into business, huh?

149
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,895
Well, then, I'm the man to see.

150
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,523
Besides sheriff, I'm also tax collector,
captain of the fire brigade

151
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:36,318
and chairman of
the Nonpartisan Anti-Chinese League.

152
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:38,779
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?

153
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:42,491
Yeah, a man of many parts.

154
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:45,994
- Say, you folks got a place to stay yet?
- No.

155
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,915
- Like I said, we just got here.
- I also sit on the town lot commission.

156
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:53,043
Really?

157
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:57,214
As a matter of fact, we got three
lovely cottages coming up for rent.

158
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:00,133
I'll throw in a good cleaning, no charge.

159
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:02,469
Believe me, Mr Earp,

160
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:06,306
you're not gonna find a better deal
within town limits.

161
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,141
I don't know, sounds pretty good.

162
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:11,812
- I'll have my man show 'em to ya.
- Thank you.

163
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:21,071
Hey, Wyatt, get on over here.

164
00:17:22,031 --> 00:17:24,783
I want you to meet Fred White.
He's the town marshal.

165
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,035
- My pleasure.
- Lotta law around here.

166
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,288
- I already met the county sheriff.
- Who, Behan?

167
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:34,083
He ain't no law. The only real law
around here is the Cowboys.

168
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:38,336
Cowboys? I had a run-in
with a couple of them up in Prescott.

169
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:42,090
Nobody does nothin' without 'em.
I mean, they're it.

170
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:44,050
There's three of 'em right over there.

171
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:48,138
You can always spot a Cowboy.
They always wear those red sashes.

172
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:51,015
The plain fact is the Cowboys
are good for business.

173
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,892
'Bout all these saloons?

174
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:55,603
Oh, that's the real mother lode
here in Tombstone.

175
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,772
All up and down Allen Street here.

176
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:00,984
24 hours a day,
you got liquor, hostesses, gamblin',

177
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,445
makin' money hand over fist.

178
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:07,323
All except The Oriental.
That's a regular slaughterhouse.

179
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:10,994
Even the high rollers won't go near it.

180
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,788
That's too bad too. It's a nice place.

181
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:17,292
Hell of a waste.

182
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:21,212
Wyatt?

183
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:23,506
- There he goes.
- Yeah.

184
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:26,760
OI' Wyatt.

185
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,185
All right, fella,
I'll brace ya now for a little lesson.

186
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:38,646
Put your money on the board.
$5 on that six of spades.

187
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,982
Like that.

188
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:45,612
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Get that cigar outta my face.

189
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:48,281
Howdy, stranger. What can I get ya?

190
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:50,283
I wouldn't mind one of those cigars.

191
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:52,619
I'm about ready to go home.
I wish y'all would stop yakkin'

192
00:18:52,703 --> 00:18:55,038
- and just play cards.
- Thank you.

193
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:58,458
Kinda nice in here. You run it?

194
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,710
Milt Joyce, owner, operator.

195
00:19:00,836 --> 00:19:04,297
- Wyatt Earp.
- Yeah, sure.

196
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:07,091
I said lay off the queen, you jackass!

197
00:19:07,176 --> 00:19:10,011
I swear I'm gonna slap somebody now.

198
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:14,849
Excuse me for askin', Milt,
but kinda dead in here, isn't it?

199
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:18,770
- You don't listen too good, do ya?
- See that bird at the faro table?

200
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:20,896
You back that queen again,
you son of a bitch,

201
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,608
I'll blow you right up that wildcat's ass!
Do you hear me, huh?

202
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:26,401
He comes bargin' in here one day,

203
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:28,695
slappin' all the customers,
wavin' his gun around.

204
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,073
He chased out all the high-class play.

205
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:33,784
The only trade that comes in here now
is the bummers and the drovers,

206
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,118
just the dregs.

207
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:38,997
Why don't you get rid of him,
get yourself a straight dealer?

208
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:41,166
Sure, stranger,
that's easy for you to say.

209
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:42,709
Shit!

210
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:48,674
Goddamn it, Junior,
how many times am I going to tell you

211
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:52,553
to keep that damn cigar outta my face?

212
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,681
Christ almighty,
it's like I'm sittin' here playing cards

213
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:57,432
with my brother's kids or somethin',

214
00:19:57,517 --> 00:19:59,935
you nerve-racking sons of bitches.

215
00:20:02,438 --> 00:20:04,648
Is somethin' on your mind?

216
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:08,694
Just want to let you know
you're sittin' in my chair.

217
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:10,779
Is that a fact?

218
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:12,614
Yeah, it's a fact.

219
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:16,785
For a man that don't go heeled, you run
your mouth kinda reckless, don't ya?

220
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,455
No need to go heeled to get
the bulge on a dub like you.

221
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:23,292
Is that a fact?

222
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:26,628
That's a fact.

223
00:20:28,214 --> 00:20:31,300
Well, I'm real scared.

224
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:35,512
Damn right, you're scared.
I can see that in your eyes.

225
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:38,307
- All right now!
- Go ahead.

226
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:42,477
Go ahead, skin it! Skin that
smoke wagon and see what happens.

227
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:48,108
Listen, mister,
I'm gettin' awful tired of your...

228
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:52,321
I'm gettin' tired of your gas.
Nowjerk that pistol and go to work.

229
00:20:54,741 --> 00:20:56,992
I said throw down, boy.

230
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:08,127
You gonna do somethin',
or just stand there and bleed?

231
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:12,506
No?

232
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:17,970
I didn't think so.

233
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,973
Here, Milt, a keepsake.

234
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:28,064
Hang it over the bar.
All right, youngster, out you go.

235
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,526
Don't come back!

236
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:33,861
Ever!

237
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,202
Well, what do you say, Milt?

238
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:44,330
25% of the house take
sound about right?

239
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:54,256
Well, we're off and runnin'.

240
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:57,259
Just acquired us a quarter interest
in the game at the Oriental.

241
00:21:57,344 --> 00:21:59,553
- Acquired?
- So to speak.

242
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:06,435
Now all we gotta do is keep our
eyes on that brass ring, fellas.

243
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:08,437
You're the one, Wyatt.

244
00:22:09,147 --> 00:22:11,148
Why, Johnny Tyler!

245
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:14,986
- You madcap!
- Doc?

246
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:18,030
Where you goin' with that shotgun?

247
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:21,617
I didn't know you was back in town.

248
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:25,997
Well, well.

249
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:29,749
How the hell are you?

250
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:33,461
Wyatt, I am rolling. Morgan.

251
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,256
- Doc.
- Virgil.

252
00:22:36,966 --> 00:22:38,758
'Lo, Doc.

253
00:22:39,176 --> 00:22:40,760
Wyatt Earp?

254
00:22:46,392 --> 00:22:48,810
Going into business for ourselves, Doc.

255
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:52,272
Wyatt just got us a faro game.

256
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:54,648
Since when is faro a business?

257
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,192
Didn't you always say that
gambling's an honest trade?

258
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:59,486
No. I said poker's an honest trade.

259
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,489
Only suckers buck the tiger.
The odds are all on the house.

260
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:03,991
Depends on how you look at it.

261
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:07,202
I mean, it's not like anybody's
puttin' a gun to their head now, is it?

262
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:11,665
That's what I love about Wyatt.
He can talk himself into anything.

263
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,921
Oh. Johnny, I apologise.
I forgot you were there.

264
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:19,798
You may go now.

265
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,801
Just leave that shotgun.

266
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:28,724
Leave it.

267
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,561
Thank you.

268
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:39,610
- Sheriff Behan!
- Gentlemen!

269
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:42,905
Sheriff, have you met Doc Holliday?

270
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,740
Piss on you, Wyatt.

271
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:47,534
Mr Holliday.

272
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:52,915
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.

273
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,921
- So, how's our little town suit you?
- Fine. Fine.

274
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:01,674
You know, I was thinking, what this
town could really use is a racetrack.

275
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,429
Really? That's not a bad idea.
Send a signal we're growin' up.

276
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:07,931
Way ahead of yourselves,
aren't you, boys?

277
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:10,141
This is just another mining camp.

278
00:24:10,226 --> 00:24:13,853
Have you seen how everyone dresses?
Awful tony for a mining camp.

279
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:15,980
No sir, the die is cast. We are growin'.

280
00:24:16,065 --> 00:24:19,859
Be as big as San Francisco in
a few years, and just as sophisticated.

281
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:23,905
You son of a bitch!

282
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:26,950
Easy, gents! It's a private affair!

283
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,618
Don't raise that iron.
I don't wanna have to...

284
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:31,538
I'll kill you, you cheatin' son of a...

285
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:35,917
Very cosmopolitan.

286
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:40,213
I know him. That's Creek Johnson.

287
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:45,884
Wyatt? Doc?

288
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:50,222
- Jack.
- What do you say, old friend?

289
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,227
What the hell's that all about, Creek?

290
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:58,188
He crawfished a bet
and called me a liar.

291
00:24:58,273 --> 00:25:01,483
Sheriff, may I present
a pair of fellow sophisticates.

292
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,110
Turkey Creek Jack Johnson,

293
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:05,404
Texas Jack Vermillion.

294
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,531
Watch your ear, Creek.

295
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,036
- Afraid I'll have to have those guns.
- It was a fair fight. We was legal.

296
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:16,039
I'm sorry, boys.
I gotta take you before Judge Spicer.

297
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:17,791
Hand 'em over.

298
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:20,627
Law and order every time, that's us.

299
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,145
I'm frightfully thirsty.

300
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:41,148
Well, we made it safe and sound.

301
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:48,780
Sheriff, what kinda town is this?

302
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:54,661
Nice scenery.

303
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:04,421
Well, an enchanted moment.

304
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,806
Interesting little scene.
I wonder who that tall drink of water is.

305
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:18,810
My dear, you have set your gaze
upon the quintessential frontier type.

306
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:23,732
Note the lean silhouette, eyes closed
by the sun, though sharp as a hawk.

307
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:27,194
He's got the look of
both predator and prey.

308
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,779
I want one.

309
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:31,656
Happy hunting.

310
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:00,393
Hey there, sister boy!

311
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:02,478
Please, sister boy, gimme some!

312
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:05,773
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- Leave him alone, Barnes!

313
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,776
Billy, sit with me.

314
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,577
This is so much fun. We haven't
been to a show since years.

315
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,289
I hope they're good.

316
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,127
- Wyatt?
- Oh, sorry.

317
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,049
Darlin', you know the Earps.

318
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:36,177
Kate, how you been?

319
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,557
Mattie, ravishin'.

320
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:42,100
Doc.

321
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:48,481
Wyatt, I'd like ya
to meet Mayor Clum and his wife.

322
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,816
- Mr Earp.
- Mayor.

323
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,818
Your reputation precedes you.

324
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:56,114
- I was wondering if you might be...
- Not a prayer. Nice meetin' you.

325
00:28:09,045 --> 00:28:12,672
Professor Gillman? Oh, I seen him
in Bisbee. He catches stuff.

326
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,257
Hey, Professor, catch this.

327
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:21,472
They're shooting at us!
They're actually shooting at us.

328
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,434
At least we won't have to wait
for our notices.

329
00:28:26,436 --> 00:28:28,896
Prettiest man I ever saw.

330
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:34,276
Ladies and gentlemen,

331
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:36,904
the St Crispin's Day
speech from Henry V.

332
00:28:36,988 --> 00:28:38,739
To set the scene...

333
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:42,534
- Goddamn, Barnes!
- Almost shot my damn ear off.

334
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:45,079
"If we are marked to die,

335
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:47,956
"we are now to do our country loss.

336
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:52,753
"But if to live, the fewer men,
the greater share of honour."

337
00:28:52,837 --> 00:28:56,507
He's got some nerve, I'll say that.
What d'ya think there, Billy Nilly?

338
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,550
I think he's wonderful.

339
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:01,553
"...gentle his condition.

340
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:04,014
"Gentlemen in England now abed shall
think themselves accurs'd

341
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:06,183
"they were not here,

342
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:08,811
"and hold their manhoods cheap

343
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:13,399
"whilst any speaks who fought with us
upon Saint Crispin's day."

344
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:16,735
That's great! That's our kinda stuff!

345
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:26,662
Play it again!

346
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:39,508
Now what in the hell is this?

347
00:29:39,592 --> 00:29:43,011
That's Faust.
He's gonna make a deal with the devil.

348
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:47,850
Is your soul for sale, dear?

349
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:04,490
Know what I'd do?

350
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:08,953
I'd take a deal and then crawfish
and drill that old devil in the ass.

351
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,208
How 'bout you, Juanito?
What would you do?

352
00:30:15,544 --> 00:30:17,211
I already did it.

353
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,066
Very instructive.

354
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:48,868
But who was the devil?

355
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:03,925
I'll be damned.

356
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:07,887
You may indeed, if you get lucky.

357
00:31:13,602 --> 00:31:15,478
Would you look at all those stars?

358
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:19,941
I mean, you look up and you think,
"God made all of that?

359
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:23,194
"He still remembered to make
a little speck like me."

360
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,197
Kinda flattering, really.

361
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:28,950
Wyatt, do you believe in God?

362
00:31:29,076 --> 00:31:33,663
- No, come on, really. Do ya?
- Yeah. Maybe. Hell, I don't know.

363
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:35,957
Well, what d'you think
happens when you die?

364
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,417
Somethin'. Nothin'. Hell, I don't know.

365
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:41,212
Well, I read this book,
a book on spiritualism.

366
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:43,756
Oh, God, here he goes again.

367
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,009
Said that a lot of people
when they die, they see this light.

368
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:49,469
- Like in a tunnel.
- Yeah?

369
00:31:49,595 --> 00:31:51,137
They say it's the light
leadin' you to heaven.

370
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:52,264
Really?

371
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:54,516
Well, what about hell?
They got a sign there, or what?

372
00:31:54,642 --> 00:31:55,850
Hey, Wyatt, goddamn it.

373
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:58,228
- I'm serious.
- Hey, Morg.

374
00:31:58,312 --> 00:31:59,771
Comin' to the Oriental, Virg?

375
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:02,065
- Well.
- Not tonight.

376
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:04,943
Tonight, me and my old man
are gonna have some fun.

377
00:32:05,027 --> 00:32:07,070
Come on, get movin', old man.

378
00:32:07,154 --> 00:32:10,072
Maiden name was Sullivan.

379
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,911
Well, you better go with them, honey.
I gotta go to work.

380
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:17,830
Please stay with me.

381
00:32:17,914 --> 00:32:20,416
Well, honey, I gotta get to work.

382
00:32:21,418 --> 00:32:24,628
All right. All right.

383
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:28,257
Well, wait a minute.
I guess I don't have to go right now. I...

384
00:32:28,341 --> 00:32:30,884
- I could stay awhile.
- No, no. I don't wanna keep you.

385
00:32:31,011 --> 00:32:33,512
No, really, I can stay awhile.

386
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:37,850
That the bottle Lou gave you?

387
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:40,311
Yes, it is.

388
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:44,189
Maybe you should see a doctor.

389
00:32:45,442 --> 00:32:47,901
Wyatt, it's just headaches.

390
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:51,113
I know what I'm doing.
No, I don't need to see a doctor!

391
00:32:51,197 --> 00:32:53,782
- All right, honey. Okay.
- Just go.

392
00:32:54,868 --> 00:32:56,994
Everything's fine, Wyatt.

393
00:32:57,078 --> 00:33:00,205
- Work well.
- All right, good night.

394
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:05,169
You look beautiful tonight.

395
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:08,339
Thank you.

396
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:13,719
- Night, Mattie.
- Good night, Morgan.

397
00:33:17,058 --> 00:33:18,391
Come on.

398
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:25,899
I want to match seven,
seven stinkin' spades.

399
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:27,817
- Let's go.
- I'm your man.

400
00:33:27,902 --> 00:33:30,987
You win again. Well played, sir.
You are on fire.

401
00:33:31,072 --> 00:33:33,239
- I told you, I'm burnin' up tonight.
- Loser on the ace.

402
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:36,909
I'll take the red seven,
and I got some deeds here.

403
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:40,663
- I'll take seven stinkin' diamonds.
- Awful lot of money.

404
00:33:40,747 --> 00:33:42,706
You can't stand the heat, pal,
get out of the kitchen.

405
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:43,874
You're the doctor.

406
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,085
Sad news, friend, you lose.

407
00:33:47,212 --> 00:33:50,047
- So, now we're in the mining business.
- You're the one, Wyatt.

408
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:52,633
We're turnin' into regular tycoons.

409
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:54,510
Think I'll call this one
the Mattie Blaylock.

410
00:33:54,594 --> 00:33:55,803
Mattie'd get a kick outta that one.

411
00:33:55,887 --> 00:33:58,472
- That's her maiden name.
- And what a maiden.

412
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:01,475
- Pure as the driven snow, I'm sure.
- Hey, Doc, come on now.

413
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:05,104
It's just his style, Morg.
He doesn't mean anything.

414
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,815
Tell me something, my friend.
I'm curious.

415
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:12,778
Do you actually consider yourself
a married man, forsaking all others?

416
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:14,530
Yeah, pretty much.

417
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:18,450
I mean, I was no angel
when we met, but neither was she.

418
00:34:18,535 --> 00:34:22,705
People can change, Doc.
Sooner or later, you gotta grow up.

419
00:34:23,206 --> 00:34:24,456
I see.

420
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:28,877
And what would you do,
if she walked in here?

421
00:34:29,462 --> 00:34:33,632
- "She"?
- You know damn well who I mean.

422
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:36,593
That dusky-hued
lady satan, that's who.

423
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:38,929
- Oh, I'd probably ignore her.
- Ignore her?

424
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,932
I'd ignore her. People can change, Doc.

425
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:44,351
I'll remember you said that.

426
00:34:45,145 --> 00:34:46,353
What?

427
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:53,736
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Ma'am? Miss Marcus?

428
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,237
Aw, hell.

429
00:34:59,325 --> 00:35:01,326
Bravo!

430
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,556
Miss Marcus, allow me
the pleasure of a drink.

431
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,559
- Thank you, sir.
- Milt, champagne!

432
00:35:27,352 --> 00:35:28,519
Satisfied?

433
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:31,814
I stand corrected, Wyatt. You're an oak.

434
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:45,536
Thanks, Kate.

435
00:35:56,006 --> 00:35:57,590
Mr Fabian.

436
00:35:58,091 --> 00:35:59,509
- Well done.
- Well done.

437
00:35:59,593 --> 00:36:01,427
Good show, partner, good show.

438
00:36:01,553 --> 00:36:04,388
Mr Fabian, would you
come sit at my table?

439
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:08,351
Mr Earp, would you mind signing
an autograph for me, sir?

440
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:12,897
My wife's not gonna believe this.

441
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:22,073
Wyatt Earp, huh? Heard of you.

442
00:36:24,243 --> 00:36:27,245
Listen now, Mr Kansas Law Dog.

443
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:29,956
Law don't go around here. Savvy?

444
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:33,751
- I'm retired.
- Good.

445
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:35,795
That's real good.

446
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:40,299
Yeah. Yeah, that's real good, law dog,
'cause lawjust don't go around here.

447
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:41,843
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

448
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:44,178
Winner to the king. $500.

449
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:52,687
- Shut up, Ike.
- You must be Doc Holliday.

450
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:56,607
That's the rumour.

451
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:58,442
You retired too?

452
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:02,737
Not me. I'm in my prime.

453
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:05,448
Yeah, you look it.

454
00:37:08,452 --> 00:37:11,078
You must be Ringo.

455
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,373
Look, darlin', Johnny Ringo,

456
00:37:14,457 --> 00:37:17,960
the deadliest pistoleer
since Wild Bill, they say.

457
00:37:20,297 --> 00:37:23,090
What do you think, darlin',
should I hate him?

458
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:27,428
- You don't even know him.
- No. That's true, but...

459
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:31,223
I don't know,
there's just somethin' about him.

460
00:37:31,308 --> 00:37:33,517
Somethin' 'round the eyes.

461
00:37:35,395 --> 00:37:37,021
I don't know.

462
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:38,814
Reminds me of...

463
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:40,983
Me.

464
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:45,654
No. I'm sure of it, I hate him.

465
00:37:46,656 --> 00:37:48,324
He's drunk.

466
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:16,018
Come on, boys, we don't want any
trouble in here, not in any language.

467
00:38:16,603 --> 00:38:18,270
That's Latin, darlin'.

468
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:21,106
Evidently, Mr Ringo's
an educated man.

469
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:24,735
Now I really hate him.

470
00:38:25,862 --> 00:38:27,529
Watch it, Johnny.

471
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:30,741
I hear he's real fast.

472
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,544
Come on. Go, Johnny.

473
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,898
Bravo!

474
00:39:55,534 --> 00:39:57,201
Drinks are on me!

475
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,670
Gettin' kinda spooky around here.

476
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:09,714
Curly Bill, huh?

477
00:40:10,132 --> 00:40:13,593
- Who was that other idiot?
- Ike Clanton.

478
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:17,305
- Table's open!
- The man dealing faro, who is he?

479
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:22,810
That's Wyatt Earp. Made a name for
himself as a peace officer in Kansas.

480
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,439
Peace officer.

481
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,232
Very impressive.

482
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:33,696
I believe he's married.

483
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:38,826
More champagne?

484
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:56,802
Oh, hell.

485
00:41:05,686 --> 00:41:07,521
- Hello.
- Hello.

486
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,608
We've never actually met.
My name is...

487
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:13,860
Wyatt Earp. Yes, I know.

488
00:41:13,945 --> 00:41:16,238
- I'm...
- Josephine Marcus.

489
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:19,032
Everybody knows.

490
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:22,285
I was beginning to think
we'd never meet.

491
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:25,539
This is fortuitous. That means "lucky."

492
00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:28,625
Yeah, I know what it means.

493
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:32,420
- Easy now.
- What is it?

494
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:34,464
That mare is in season.

495
00:41:35,424 --> 00:41:37,342
Bet she's starting.

496
00:41:37,593 --> 00:41:41,847
- How do they know?
- They know. It's the scent.

497
00:41:46,102 --> 00:41:47,936
Well, I guess we'd better split 'em up.
It's been real...

498
00:41:48,062 --> 00:41:49,563
I have a better idea.

499
00:41:49,689 --> 00:41:51,897
Let's run it out of them.

500
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:56,068
Yeah, I'm an oak, all right.

501
00:42:39,988 --> 00:42:42,573
Well, end of the road.

502
00:42:42,657 --> 00:42:44,158
Maybe for you.

503
00:43:06,514 --> 00:43:07,890
That was lovely.

504
00:43:07,974 --> 00:43:11,018
Lovely? You could've been
killed back there, or busted up.

505
00:43:11,144 --> 00:43:13,229
Fun, though, wasn't it?

506
00:43:13,313 --> 00:43:16,232
- You'd die for fun?
- Wouldn't you?

507
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:21,320
Oh, he's laughing.
I didn't think you ever laughed.

508
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:23,572
Yeah, I laugh sometimes.

509
00:43:23,657 --> 00:43:26,242
Yes, but how often? Are you happy?

510
00:43:26,826 --> 00:43:30,996
Am I happy? Well, I don't know.
I'm happy as the next man, I guess.

511
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:35,459
I don't laugh all day long like an idiot,
if that's what you mean.

512
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:38,254
- Touchy about it, aren't you?
- No, I'm not touchy. I'm just...

513
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:39,838
It's a silly question, is all.

514
00:43:39,923 --> 00:43:42,341
"Am I happy? Are you happy?"
Are you happy?

515
00:43:42,425 --> 00:43:45,469
Oh, I'm always happy,
unless I'm bored.

516
00:43:46,263 --> 00:43:49,181
That blonde woman, is that your wife?

517
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:53,686
- What about her?
- Nothing.

518
00:43:55,063 --> 00:43:57,314
What do you want out of life?

519
00:44:01,027 --> 00:44:03,195
- How do you get these questions?
- Just answer.

520
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,281
I don't know!
Make some money, I guess.

521
00:44:05,365 --> 00:44:08,867
- Maybe have some children.
- Doesn't suit you.

522
00:44:09,953 --> 00:44:12,955
- Well, how would you know?
- It just doesn't, that's all.

523
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:14,581
I oughta know my own mind,

524
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:17,042
and I'm telling you what suits me
is a family and kids.

525
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:20,295
Suits me right down to the ground.
In fact, that's my idea of heaven.

526
00:44:20,379 --> 00:44:22,714
All right, what's your idea of heaven?

527
00:44:22,798 --> 00:44:24,257
Room service.

528
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:29,637
Oh, he's laughing again.
Well, that's what I want.

529
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:34,225
I wanna move and go places
and never look back.

530
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:36,561
Just have fun, forever.

531
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:40,773
That's my idea of heaven.
Need someone to share it with, though.

532
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:44,444
You mean Behan.

533
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:48,990
Well, then...

534
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:52,702
Why are you with him?

535
00:44:52,786 --> 00:44:57,081
Because he's handsome
and he's charming and...

536
00:44:57,207 --> 00:44:59,167
He's all right. For now.

537
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:03,087
Oh, I know, don't say it, I'm rotten.

538
00:45:03,172 --> 00:45:07,050
I've tried to be good. It's just so boring.

539
00:45:07,134 --> 00:45:09,385
The way you talk.

540
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,764
Never heard a woman talk like that?

541
00:45:14,308 --> 00:45:15,725
Never.

542
00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:20,188
I don't have time to be proper.
I wanna live.

543
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:23,816
I'm a woman. I like men.

544
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:28,237
If that means I'm not ladylike,
then I guess I'm just not a lady.

545
00:45:28,322 --> 00:45:31,074
- At least I'm honest.
- You're different.

546
00:45:32,785 --> 00:45:35,495
There's no arguin' that.

547
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:37,914
But you're a lady, all right.

548
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:41,793
I'll take my oath on it.

549
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,758
Come on! Giddap!

550
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,984
Is that the opium Lou gave you?

551
00:46:11,114 --> 00:46:13,323
It's a new bottle, isn't it?

552
00:46:14,992 --> 00:46:17,452
You better go easy on that stuff.

553
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:19,496
Wyatt, leave me alone.

554
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:25,794
- And where've you been?
- Just out. Ridin'.

555
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:33,969
How're you feelin', Mattie?

556
00:46:39,016 --> 00:46:41,058
I don't know.

557
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:42,893
I'm all right.

558
00:46:44,563 --> 00:46:46,355
I'm fine.

559
00:46:47,524 --> 00:46:50,192
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

560
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,364
Well, I was thinkin' today,

561
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:59,743
we've already made
a pile of money in this place.

562
00:46:59,828 --> 00:47:02,163
If we pulled up stakes
and just moved on, you know,

563
00:47:02,247 --> 00:47:04,999
then we could stay on the move,
keep goin', see the world.

564
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:08,961
Just live on room service
for the rest of our lives.

565
00:47:09,045 --> 00:47:10,880
How'd that be?

566
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:13,507
Room service?

567
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:18,554
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?

568
00:47:23,226 --> 00:47:24,977
Nothin'. I just...

569
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:27,980
Just thinkin' out loud, and you know I...

570
00:47:29,816 --> 00:47:31,442
Nothin'.

571
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:36,071
Forget about it.

572
00:47:56,342 --> 00:47:58,843
What's she doin' with that lunger?

573
00:48:10,231 --> 00:48:15,401
Hey.

574
00:48:16,654 --> 00:48:20,740
Is that Old Dog Tray?
That sounds like Old Dog Tray to me.

575
00:48:22,284 --> 00:48:23,535
Pardon?

576
00:48:24,954 --> 00:48:27,288
You know, Stephen Foster.

577
00:48:28,123 --> 00:48:30,250
Oh! Susanna.

578
00:48:30,334 --> 00:48:32,377
Camptown Races.

579
00:48:35,047 --> 00:48:37,340
Stephen stinkin' Foster!

580
00:48:38,133 --> 00:48:42,095
Yes, well,
this happens to be a nocturne.

581
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:45,890
- A which?
- You know,

582
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:48,226
Frederic fucking Chopin.

583
00:48:59,405 --> 00:49:00,989
Oh, yeah.

584
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:18,339
Boy, I feel great.

585
00:49:20,634 --> 00:49:24,512
I feel just capital.

586
00:49:55,835 --> 00:49:58,378
Do you see what's going on
in the street?

587
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:01,298
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- I believe you're the sheriff.

588
00:50:01,382 --> 00:50:05,552
No, no. This is not county business.
This is a town matter. Marshal?

589
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,600
Why don't you just leave it alone?

590
00:50:11,684 --> 00:50:15,395
No, I gotta do somethin'.

591
00:50:20,401 --> 00:50:22,402
Here's your down card.

592
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,256
Curly Bill!

593
00:50:47,261 --> 00:50:48,762
Come on now.

594
00:50:50,431 --> 00:50:52,307
Well, howdy, Fred.

595
00:50:53,226 --> 00:50:55,936
Hand those over, Curly. Hand 'em over.

596
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:02,150
Why, sure, dad.

597
00:51:04,404 --> 00:51:06,530
I'm only funnin'.

598
00:51:07,824 --> 00:51:09,408
Here you go.

599
00:51:21,796 --> 00:51:23,255
Fred?

600
00:51:24,257 --> 00:51:26,090
Come on now. Fred?

601
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:33,930
- Got ol' Fred White!
- Hey, he shot the marshal! Everybody!

602
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:36,307
Better get him off the street.

603
00:51:37,977 --> 00:51:40,895
Fred White's dead! They killed him.
They killed Fred White!

604
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,316
- All right, back off.
- Get a rope! String him up!

605
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:48,069
- Nobody's hangin' anybody.
- He just killed a man!

606
00:51:48,154 --> 00:51:51,364
Then he'll stand trial for it.
Now get back! Move!

607
00:51:55,662 --> 00:51:57,204
Turn him loose!

608
00:52:05,797 --> 00:52:08,632
He said to turn loose of him.

609
00:52:08,717 --> 00:52:11,927
Well, I'm not. So go home.

610
00:52:12,721 --> 00:52:17,933
I swear to God, law dog, you don't
step aside, we'll tear you apart.

611
00:52:18,018 --> 00:52:21,270
All right, you die first. Get it?

612
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:23,355
Your friends might get me in a rush,

613
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,109
but not before I make your head
into a canoe. You understand me?

614
00:52:27,194 --> 00:52:30,863
- He's bluffin'. Let's rush him.
- No, he ain't bluffin'.

615
00:52:32,157 --> 00:52:34,825
You're not as stupid as you look, Ike.

616
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,704
- Now tell them to get back.
- Go on now, get back.

617
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:41,373
Go on! Billy!

618
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:44,502
He'll kill me.

619
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:51,258
And you, music lover,

620
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:53,719
you're next.

621
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:58,140
It's the drunk piano player.

622
00:52:58,225 --> 00:53:00,935
You're so drunk, you can't hit nothin'.

623
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:04,438
In fact, you're probably seein' double.

624
00:53:04,564 --> 00:53:08,400
I have two guns, one for each of ya.

625
00:53:11,029 --> 00:53:13,112
All right, break it up now!

626
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,452
Go home now!

627
00:53:31,131 --> 00:53:32,841
I'll see you soon.

628
00:53:34,593 --> 00:53:37,387
- I'll see you soon.
- We'll meet again.

629
00:53:42,643 --> 00:53:44,769
Well, as you can see,

630
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:47,605
never a dull moment.

631
00:54:13,632 --> 00:54:16,050
So it takes Judge Spicer
three weeks to get back to town,

632
00:54:16,135 --> 00:54:18,803
and he says,
"Well, did you actually see it?"

633
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,849
I said, "No. By the time I got there,
Marshal White had already been shot."

634
00:54:22,933 --> 00:54:24,851
Then Spicer leans forward
and he says,

635
00:54:24,935 --> 00:54:28,229
"Well, can't have a murder
without a witness."

636
00:54:28,314 --> 00:54:31,107
- What?
- Case dismissed. Can you beat it?

637
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:34,986
After all that? Aw, hell, who cares?

638
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,530
None of my business anyway.

639
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:40,199
There you go, Milt.

640
00:54:40,284 --> 00:54:44,203
God, I love this game!
You know, boys, when we're finally set,

641
00:54:44,955 --> 00:54:48,124
we gotta each have
a billiard room in our houses.

642
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:49,584
I been thinkin',

643
00:54:49,668 --> 00:54:52,962
maybe we oughta open up
a place of our own. You know?

644
00:54:53,047 --> 00:54:56,174
There's the real money. Build it up,

645
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:58,801
milk it for all it's worth,
then sell it off for a bundle,

646
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:01,094
and breeze outta this burg
with more money than Croesus

647
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:02,679
and ready to live like kings.

648
00:55:02,764 --> 00:55:04,932
What d'ya think, Virg?

649
00:55:08,686 --> 00:55:10,896
Virg? Why don't you and me
take a walk around town

650
00:55:11,022 --> 00:55:14,441
and see if we can't spot us out
a couple of nice lots?

651
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:19,863
It's workin' out just like you said, Wyatt.

652
00:55:19,948 --> 00:55:22,908
Goddamn, boys, we're lootin'
this burg six ways from Sunday.

653
00:55:22,992 --> 00:55:24,284
Pretty fun too, isn't it?

654
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:26,745
Financially, yeah, I gotta admit.

655
00:55:26,871 --> 00:55:29,039
Excuse me.
Wyatt, do you have a moment?

656
00:55:29,123 --> 00:55:31,416
- Please, will you just hear me out?
- Now hold on, Mayor.

657
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:32,542
He already told you no.

658
00:55:32,627 --> 00:55:35,337
You tell him, Morg.

659
00:55:35,421 --> 00:55:37,923
What about you? You were a lawman.

660
00:55:40,885 --> 00:55:42,678
I'm busy.

661
00:55:43,054 --> 00:55:44,888
We're all busy.

662
00:55:46,015 --> 00:55:49,267
Sorry, Mayor,
but you're barkin' up the wrong tree.

663
00:55:49,352 --> 00:55:52,020
You know, you men are makin'
a lot of money in this town.

664
00:55:52,105 --> 00:55:54,815
That's good. That's good.
Good for you.

665
00:55:54,899 --> 00:55:58,151
In the meantime, a lot of
decent people are suffering.

666
00:55:58,236 --> 00:56:02,906
But, please, don't let me take up
any more of your precious time.

667
00:56:06,995 --> 00:56:09,162
Rack 'em.

668
00:56:09,247 --> 00:56:12,708
I tell ya, I'm suffering.
From a hangover.

669
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,425
Stop that!

670
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:25,511
- Stop.
- No.

671
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:23,985
Hold on a minute! Wait a minute!

672
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:27,322
- Calm down and listen to me!
- Yeah, let him speak!

673
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:30,200
Nobody's sayin' you can't own a gun.

674
00:57:30,326 --> 00:57:33,369
Nobody's even sayin'
you can't carry a gun.

675
00:57:33,454 --> 00:57:36,831
All we're sayin' is you
can't carry a gun in town.

676
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:43,296
That's not so bad, is it?

677
00:57:49,512 --> 00:57:52,013
Listen, Mayor, I have
to talk to you about this.

678
00:57:52,098 --> 00:57:55,183
No, we don't have to talk.
You can read, can't you?

679
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:56,309
It's a town matter, not county.

680
00:57:56,393 --> 00:58:00,522
What in the hell are you doin'?
I told you we weren't gettin' involved.

681
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:03,650
You got us involved
when you brought us here.

682
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:06,778
Now you hold on a minute, Virg.

683
00:58:06,862 --> 00:58:10,406
Hold on nothin'! I walk around this
town and look these people in the eye.

684
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:13,034
It's just like someone's
slappin' me in the face.

685
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,994
These people are afraid
to walk down the street,

686
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:18,623
and I'm tryin' to make money off that
like some goddamn vulture!

687
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:20,125
If we're gonna have
a future in this town,

688
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:21,668
it's gotta have some law and order.

689
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:24,129
Please, Virg, don't do this to me!

690
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:26,172
It's got nothin' to do with you!
It's got to do with...

691
00:58:26,257 --> 00:58:27,465
Nothin' to do with me?

692
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:30,718
I'm your brother, for Christ's sake!
God, I don't believe this!

693
00:58:30,803 --> 00:58:33,345
Talk to him, will you? Or hit him!

694
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,643
Ah, God, don't tell me!

695
00:58:39,727 --> 00:58:42,020
Like you said, Wyatt, we're brothers.

696
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:46,275
Gotta back your brother's play.
Just did like I figured you would.

697
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,862
All right now,
you listen to me, both of ya!

698
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:53,157
For the first time in our lives,

699
00:58:53,241 --> 00:58:55,826
we got a chance to stop wandering
and finally be a family.

700
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:59,621
This is trouble we don't need.
You saw what happened to Fred White.

701
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:02,082
We know what we're doin', Wyatt.

702
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:05,836
Okay, fine. Say you're right,
say you don't get yourself killed.

703
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,463
There's somethin' else.

704
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:10,299
All those years I worked
those cow towns,

705
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:14,178
I was only ever mixed up
in one shootin', just one.

706
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:17,681
But a man lost his life, and I took it.

707
00:59:17,765 --> 00:59:20,517
You don't know how that feels, Morg.

708
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:23,520
Believe me, boy,
you don't ever wanna know.

709
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,564
Not ever.

710
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:36,241
Didn't even make a dent, did I?

711
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:37,993
All right.

712
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:42,539
You're both makin' a big mistake.

713
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,516
Do you wanna ante?

714
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:03,143
Yeah, fine.

715
01:00:28,669 --> 01:00:31,254
What do you think of the singer?

716
01:00:33,507 --> 01:00:35,007
Nice voice.

717
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:40,846
Wyatt, Doc won't quit.
He's been at it for 36 hours straight.

718
01:00:41,515 --> 01:00:43,307
Clanton and the McLaury Brothers
came in an hour ago.

719
01:00:43,392 --> 01:00:45,309
I tried to get him to go to bed,
but he won't let go.

720
01:00:45,394 --> 01:00:48,229
I know, and nobody can make him.

721
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:55,653
Wyatt, just in time. Pull up a chair.

722
01:00:57,406 --> 01:01:01,033
Doc, you been hittin' it
awful hard, haven't ya?

723
01:01:01,118 --> 01:01:05,413
Nonsense.
I've not yet begun to defile myself.

724
01:01:06,248 --> 01:01:07,540
I was wonderin' if maybe you wouldn't

725
01:01:07,624 --> 01:01:08,708
wanna go on over
to the Crystal Palace.

726
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:11,544
I will not be pawed at,
thank you very much.

727
01:01:11,628 --> 01:01:13,504
- I'm sorry.
- That's right.

728
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:16,549
Doc can go on day and night,
and then some.

729
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:22,722
That's my loving man.
Have another one, my loving man.

730
01:01:24,057 --> 01:01:25,641
I'm in.

731
01:01:27,853 --> 01:01:29,186
Hey.

732
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:32,064
Loving man, you been called.

733
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:47,455
What is that now?

734
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:51,917
That 12 hands in a row, Holliday?
Son of a bitch, nobody's that lucky.

735
01:01:53,795 --> 01:01:56,756
Why, Ike, whatever do you mean?

736
01:01:58,425 --> 01:02:00,301
Take it easy, boys.

737
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:05,431
Maybe poker's just not your game, Ike.

738
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:11,102
I know, let's have a spelling contest.

739
01:02:11,187 --> 01:02:13,980
How 'bout if I just
wring your scrawny neck?

740
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:15,607
Enough, Ike.

741
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:19,235
Are you takin' his part?

742
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,946
I'm the one who got cheated!

743
01:02:22,073 --> 01:02:26,785
You goddamn pimps!
You're all in it together.

744
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:28,244
Nobody's in anything, Ike.

745
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:30,246
You're drunk.
Go on home and sleep it off.

746
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:32,999
Get your goddamn hands off me!

747
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:35,627
Don't you ever put
your hands on me, see?

748
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:37,545
Don't you ever try to
manhandle a Cowboy,

749
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,381
'cause we'll cut your
goddamn pimp's heart out.

750
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:40,548
You understand, you pimp?

751
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:42,592
Don't you threaten me,
you little son of a bitch!

752
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,804
All right! All right!
Come on, easy, Virg, easy!

753
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:48,515
You just go on home and
forget about it, huh, Ike?

754
01:02:48,641 --> 01:02:50,308
Come on, Virg.

755
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:53,603
I ain't gonna forget nothin'.

756
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:57,148
Well, that certainly was a bust.

757
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:02,404
Come, darlin'. Let's seek
our entertainment elsewhere.

758
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:06,825
Forget it, Virg. Go on.
Get some fresh air.

759
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,257
- What's wrong, Doc?
- Nothin'. Not a thing.

760
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,968
I'm right as the mail.

761
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,473
Doc? Doc!

762
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:34,269
All right, get him up.
Let's get him to the hotel.

763
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:45,947
- What's wrong with him?
- Lunger.

764
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,199
Yeah, well, I hope you die.

765
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:51,244
Give me my guns.

766
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:56,039
My rifle.

767
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:59,293
Goddamn bastards.
Think they can cheat me.

768
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,045
Nobody cheated you, Ike.
Just go home.

769
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:06,467
I don't take no mouth
from no bartenders, neither.

770
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,843
There, ya see?

771
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:12,264
Give somebody a rap on the beezer,
get some respect around here.

772
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:16,643
You tell the Earps, I see 'em
on the street and Doc Holliday,

773
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:20,397
I'm gonna send them to hell
on a shutter. You tell 'em that.

774
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,238
Pick these guns up.

775
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:29,907
Come on.

776
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:47,633
Come on, Ike.

777
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,843
Come on!

778
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:55,098
- Hey, you walkin'?
- Leave me alone.

779
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,733
- You gonna give Ike back his guns.
- Not till he sobers up.

780
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:07,528
Wearin' that badge
don't make you right.

781
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,947
Who the hell you think you are?

782
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,036
Watch the way you walk,
you stupid bastard.

783
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,121
Easy, kid, I'm sorry.

784
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,333
I ain't easy and I ain't your kid.

785
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,461
You take your sorry
and shove it up your ass.

786
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,716
I'll fight you right now.

787
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,975
Goddamn it!

788
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,560
You're gonna bleed.

789
01:05:40,644 --> 01:05:43,479
You got a fight comin'. Comin' today.

790
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:50,111
Bastards! It's comin'!

791
01:05:58,161 --> 01:06:00,663
Your condition's quite advanced.

792
01:06:00,747 --> 01:06:04,541
I'd say you lost some 60%
of your lung tissue, maybe more.

793
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:06,376
What's the verdict?

794
01:06:06,502 --> 01:06:11,339
Two years. Two days.
Hard to say. If you stop now.

795
01:06:12,842 --> 01:06:16,845
Your smokin', your drinkin',
your gamblin', your nightlife.

796
01:06:16,971 --> 01:06:19,180
You need complete rest.

797
01:06:21,183 --> 01:06:25,145
What I mean is,
you must attempt to deny

798
01:06:25,229 --> 01:06:29,691
- your marital impulse.
- Get out of my sight.

799
01:06:48,544 --> 01:06:51,046
- How are you feeling, Doc?
- Better.

800
01:06:52,006 --> 01:06:53,965
That's good.

801
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,051
I knew it wasn't nothing.

802
01:06:58,554 --> 01:07:00,472
We must talk, darlin'.

803
01:07:02,558 --> 01:07:05,018
It appears

804
01:07:05,102 --> 01:07:08,396
we must redefine the nature
of our association.

805
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:16,571
I'm a good woman to you, Doc.

806
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:20,116
Don't I always take care of ya?

807
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:23,286
Nobody cares for you like me.

808
01:07:24,246 --> 01:07:26,039
I'm a good woman.

809
01:07:27,874 --> 01:07:31,210
Yes, it's true, you are a good woman.

810
01:07:44,683 --> 01:07:46,517
Then again,

811
01:07:47,644 --> 01:07:49,937
you may be the Antichrist.

812
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:13,335
Goddamn.

813
01:08:14,754 --> 01:08:18,632
Now there's six of 'em.
Hell, this is like a bad dream.

814
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:22,845
Just stay calm. Use your head.
It'll be all right.

815
01:08:26,433 --> 01:08:28,600
Just the same, though,

816
01:08:30,812 --> 01:08:33,397
guess maybe you better swear me in.

817
01:09:08,266 --> 01:09:12,352
Those Cowboys been telling everybody
in town they're gonna clean you out.

818
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,897
They're back there in that lot
behind the O.K. Corral.

819
01:09:17,191 --> 01:09:19,192
- Thank you, Mayor.
- What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?

820
01:09:19,276 --> 01:09:22,779
What in the hell's goin' on?
Five people come up to my room

821
01:09:22,863 --> 01:09:25,740
tellin' me the Clantons and McLaurys
are gunnin' for us.

822
01:09:25,824 --> 01:09:28,826
We goin' down there or not?
What are we gonna do?

823
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:30,787
Wait till the liquor wears off.

824
01:09:30,871 --> 01:09:33,456
Soon as they start gettin' headaches,
they'll lose interest.

825
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:36,083
Lose interest, hell.
They're threatenin' our lives.

826
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:39,587
- You'll never make that stick.
- They're carryin' guns, Wyatt.

827
01:09:39,671 --> 01:09:41,631
Christ's sake, Virg,
that's a misdemeanour.

828
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:43,466
You go down there and arrest them,
something goes wrong,

829
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:45,968
maybe this time somebody really
gets his head broken.

830
01:09:46,053 --> 01:09:47,637
You'll have Cowboys comin' around
lookin' for trouble

831
01:09:47,721 --> 01:09:48,888
from here to Christmas.

832
01:09:48,972 --> 01:09:51,265
You want to risk all that
over a misdemeanour?

833
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:54,560
Damn right I'll risk it.
They're breakin' the law.

834
01:10:01,026 --> 01:10:04,862
It's not your problem, Doc.
You don't have to mix up in this.

835
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:09,909
That is a hell of a thing
for you to say to me.

836
01:10:21,421 --> 01:10:23,172
All right, Virg.

837
01:10:25,759 --> 01:10:28,344
Your call. Give Doc the shotgun.

838
01:10:30,222 --> 01:10:34,393
They'll be less apt to get nervy
if he's on the street howitzer.

839
01:11:19,854 --> 01:11:21,563
Go on! Get home!

840
01:11:23,566 --> 01:11:25,317
Goddamn kid.

841
01:11:37,204 --> 01:11:40,248
How the hell did we
get ourselves into this?

842
01:11:43,586 --> 01:11:45,045
You don't have to worry about a thing.

843
01:11:45,129 --> 01:11:46,379
I just went over there
and disarmed them.

844
01:11:46,464 --> 01:11:49,507
You did? Come on, boys.

845
01:11:49,592 --> 01:11:52,844
Gentlemen, I'm not
gonna allow any trouble.

846
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,703
We're here to disarm you.
Throw up your hands.

847
01:12:23,084 --> 01:12:25,627
Hold it! That's not what I want!

848
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,079
Oh, my God.

849
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,424
Billy! Billy!

850
01:13:20,056 --> 01:13:22,474
Stop! No! No!

851
01:13:23,184 --> 01:13:25,686
Don't shoot! I got no gun!

852
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:28,022
Please don't shoot me! I got no gun!

853
01:13:28,106 --> 01:13:31,442
This fight's commenced!
Get to fightin' or get away!

854
01:13:33,445 --> 01:13:35,362
- That's it!
- Shut the door!

855
01:13:50,837 --> 01:13:53,213
Give me your goddamned gun!
Damn it!

856
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:55,549
Billy! Billy!

857
01:13:55,633 --> 01:13:57,468
Doc, behind us!

858
01:14:24,662 --> 01:14:27,206
I got you now, you son of a bitch.

859
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:29,374
You're a daisy if you do.

860
01:14:43,764 --> 01:14:46,307
Morgan, hold quiet now.

861
01:14:57,361 --> 01:14:59,487
Here you go. Easy. Easy, man.

862
01:14:59,571 --> 01:15:02,323
- I got you. All right.
- All right!

863
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:07,120
All of you are under arrest.

864
01:15:17,589 --> 01:15:20,925
I don't think I'll let you
arrest us today, Behan.

865
01:15:50,121 --> 01:15:52,122
Virg!

866
01:15:52,206 --> 01:15:53,999
Virgil!

867
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:18,148
Well, I guess we did
our good deed for today, Mayor.

868
01:17:42,816 --> 01:17:45,859
You were right.
It's nothin' like I thought.

869
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:50,406
- I almost wish that...
- I know, Morgan.

870
01:17:51,741 --> 01:17:53,867
I know. Me too.

871
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,007
Outta the way!

872
01:18:12,636 --> 01:18:14,220
Gettin' warmer.

873
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:17,223
Guess spring's comin'.

874
01:18:17,308 --> 01:18:19,559
Hello, Billy. I say hello.

875
01:18:19,643 --> 01:18:21,811
It's deputy!
And I don't want to talk to you!

876
01:18:21,895 --> 01:18:24,647
Those men you killed were my friends.

877
01:18:25,733 --> 01:18:28,109
I'm just a nothin'.
But if I wasn't, I'd fight you right now,

878
01:18:28,193 --> 01:18:30,570
so I don't want to talk to you.

879
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:35,241
All they ever did was laugh at him.

880
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:47,170
Sister boy should've stuck around.

881
01:18:49,798 --> 01:18:53,509
- What do you want, Ringo?
- I want your blood.

882
01:18:55,137 --> 01:18:57,347
And I want your souls.

883
01:18:57,931 --> 01:19:00,308
And I want 'em both right now.

884
01:19:00,392 --> 01:19:03,895
- I don't want any more trouble.
- Well, ya got trouble!

885
01:19:06,231 --> 01:19:08,441
And it starts with you.

886
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:14,822
I'm not gonna fight you, Ringo.

887
01:19:15,783 --> 01:19:17,784
There's no money in it.

888
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:20,453
Sober up. Come on, boys.

889
01:19:20,954 --> 01:19:23,456
You wretched slugs.

890
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:25,958
Don't any of ya have the guts
to play for blood?

891
01:19:26,043 --> 01:19:28,127
I'm your huckleberry.

892
01:19:30,089 --> 01:19:32,048
That's just my game.

893
01:19:39,598 --> 01:19:43,309
All right, lunger. You go to hell.

894
01:19:44,978 --> 01:19:47,980
- I'll put you out of your misery.
- Say when.

895
01:19:48,816 --> 01:19:51,359
- Johnny, don't!
- No, Johnny!

896
01:19:52,904 --> 01:19:54,571
- Get off!
- Easy now!

897
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,197
- Get off!
- It ain't nothin'.

898
01:19:56,281 --> 01:19:59,158
Don't mind him!
He's just drunk, that's all.

899
01:20:02,162 --> 01:20:03,788
Cool down, Johnny!

900
01:20:03,872 --> 01:20:06,082
No! No!

901
01:20:07,084 --> 01:20:09,293
I want them spittin' blood!

902
01:20:09,378 --> 01:20:11,879
Easy, son, easy! Now ain't the time!

903
01:20:11,964 --> 01:20:13,631
Slow down, Ringo.

904
01:20:16,009 --> 01:20:17,844
I tell ya, boys, even I'm worried
what's gonna happen

905
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:19,470
once Ringo runs this outfit.

906
01:20:19,555 --> 01:20:22,306
God have mercy!

907
01:20:22,391 --> 01:20:25,435
- Juanito, their time will come.
- Gentlemen.

908
01:20:26,228 --> 01:20:28,896
- Let's go get bullied, boy!
- Let's go get soused!

909
01:20:29,022 --> 01:20:31,065
- Barber.
- Yes, sir?

910
01:20:34,153 --> 01:20:35,695
Proceed, sir.

911
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:55,589
Listen to me. I need to speak with you.

912
01:20:56,382 --> 01:20:58,091
Not now. I'm busy.

913
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:02,179
I see what's going on
between you and Wyatt.

914
01:21:02,263 --> 01:21:04,931
I'm not a fool. But listen to me.

915
01:21:06,058 --> 01:21:08,727
Lots of so-called hard cases
and tough nuts

916
01:21:08,853 --> 01:21:10,228
come and go around this town,

917
01:21:10,313 --> 01:21:14,524
but none of them has a clue
about the real play, none of them.

918
01:21:14,609 --> 01:21:18,570
Now after tonight, there'll be one man
in charge of Tombstone.

919
01:21:18,654 --> 01:21:21,448
You'll be happy to know him. Bet on it.

920
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:33,710
Gonna be one of those nights.

921
01:21:36,881 --> 01:21:39,549
It's gettin' late, boys.
I'm gonna go to bed.

922
01:21:39,634 --> 01:21:42,302
- Good night, Virg.
- Good night, Morg.

923
01:21:43,887 --> 01:21:46,972
Bundle up, Virg.
It's gettin' cold out there.

924
01:21:47,098 --> 01:21:48,224
Yeah.

925
01:22:15,502 --> 01:22:17,461
Tower of Babel.

926
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:20,631
Death and the Devil.

927
01:22:20,715 --> 01:22:21,715
Oh, dear.

928
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,635
Oh, Allie. I wish you'd learn to play
a real card game.

929
01:22:29,474 --> 01:22:32,309
- More tea, Mattie?
- No, no.

930
01:22:32,394 --> 01:22:34,311
- Are you all right, Mattie?
- Yes.

931
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:37,064
- Are you expecting someone?
- Only Virg.

932
01:22:42,279 --> 01:22:45,990
Please. I know it's awful
to come here, but listen.

933
01:22:46,074 --> 01:22:48,867
I think something's
gonna happen tonight.

934
01:22:50,996 --> 01:22:53,205
It's Virg.

935
01:22:53,331 --> 01:22:54,999
No! Get down!

936
01:23:13,643 --> 01:23:16,145
That thunder's sure gettin' close.

937
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:31,159
Virgil. What'd ya forget?

938
01:23:42,212 --> 01:23:43,713
Wyatt.

939
01:23:56,727 --> 01:23:59,687
Will you hurry with that water, please?

940
01:23:59,772 --> 01:24:01,939
Come on, Lou.

941
01:24:05,402 --> 01:24:07,362
Wyatt! Wyatt!

942
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,158
They hit Clum's house too,
shot up his wife.

943
01:24:12,242 --> 01:24:14,410
His wife! Whoever heard of that?

944
01:24:14,495 --> 01:24:17,664
They're bugs, Wyatt. All that
smart talk about live and let live.

945
01:24:17,748 --> 01:24:19,332
There ain't no live
and let live with bugs.

946
01:24:19,416 --> 01:24:22,085
All right, you listen to me now.
We gotta get out of here.

947
01:24:22,169 --> 01:24:25,463
Get out of here?
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.

948
01:24:25,547 --> 01:24:28,132
Lie down and crawl or you might
get hurt? What kind of talk is that?

949
01:24:28,217 --> 01:24:30,426
- Do you see what's happening here?
- What?

950
01:24:30,552 --> 01:24:33,513
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

951
01:24:33,597 --> 01:24:35,431
No. Please, no.

952
01:24:35,516 --> 01:24:39,394
I'm afraid your husband's
going to lose the use of his arm.

953
01:24:39,478 --> 01:24:41,562
Oh, God, no.

954
01:24:43,607 --> 01:24:45,650
Don't worry, Allie girl.

955
01:24:45,734 --> 01:24:48,611
I still got one good arm
to hold you with.

956
01:24:50,864 --> 01:24:51,864
Goddamn!

957
01:24:51,949 --> 01:24:56,536
- Goddamn sons of bitches!
- Morgan, wait a minute! Virg.

958
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:59,497
- You had to be so damn smart.
- I'm sorry, Allie.

959
01:24:59,581 --> 01:25:01,124
I told you, Virg.

960
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:03,751
- Not now, Wyatt.
- All right.

961
01:25:03,836 --> 01:25:05,878
All right, what do you want me to do?

962
01:25:05,963 --> 01:25:09,799
- Just leave me alone, for God's sakes.
- Virg...

963
01:25:09,883 --> 01:25:12,635
He doesn't want to talk now, Wyatt!

964
01:25:29,818 --> 01:25:32,820
I heard about what they did
to your women. That was wrong.

965
01:25:32,904 --> 01:25:37,074
I'm here to let you know that it
wasn't me. I had no part of it.

966
01:25:37,159 --> 01:25:41,579
No? Brothers to the bone,
right, McMasters?

967
01:25:41,663 --> 01:25:45,374
No. Not any more. Not after this night.

968
01:25:46,668 --> 01:25:50,504
He's right, Wyatt. You want us
for anything, we're with you.

969
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:52,006
Come on.

970
01:26:55,654 --> 01:26:57,655
Hold him!

971
01:26:59,241 --> 01:27:01,700
No! Get her out of here! Jesus!

972
01:27:03,078 --> 01:27:05,578
Somebody shut that dog up!

973
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:11,292
I said hold him, goddamn it!

974
01:27:11,377 --> 01:27:14,754
Somebody get
that goddamn dog out of here!

975
01:27:14,839 --> 01:27:17,423
The bullet's too deep. I can't get it out.

976
01:27:20,177 --> 01:27:22,971
The way it's lodged in there. I'm sorry.

977
01:27:23,055 --> 01:27:25,431
Easy, Morg. Is that better?

978
01:27:26,851 --> 01:27:28,101
Yeah.

979
01:27:31,355 --> 01:27:35,066
You were right, Wyatt.
They got me good.

980
01:27:37,862 --> 01:27:41,072
Don't let 'em get you, brother.
You're the one.

981
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:43,950
Easy, Morg.

982
01:27:45,786 --> 01:27:47,912
Don't worry about that now.

983
01:27:52,793 --> 01:27:56,087
Remember what I said
about seein' a light when you're dyin'?

984
01:27:56,714 --> 01:27:58,965
Yeah. Yeah.

985
01:27:59,717 --> 01:28:01,718
That ain't true.

986
01:28:01,802 --> 01:28:04,095
I can't see a damn thing.

987
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,100
Morg?

988
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:15,231
Morg!

989
01:28:21,572 --> 01:28:22,989
Morg?

990
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:39,005
No.

991
01:28:41,759 --> 01:28:43,718
Morgan! No!

992
01:28:43,802 --> 01:28:47,555
Morgan, don't die! I love you!

993
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,724
Don't die!

994
01:29:02,445 --> 01:29:05,530
Why? Why him?

995
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:13,498
- No. No, get away from me!
- Wyatt!

996
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:17,251
Can't you see? Get away from me!

997
01:29:52,705 --> 01:29:54,330
Morgan!

998
01:30:46,214 --> 01:30:49,133
And so she walked
out of our lives forever.

999
01:31:25,003 --> 01:31:27,338
I want you to know it's over.

1000
01:31:29,508 --> 01:31:30,841
Well.

1001
01:31:33,011 --> 01:31:34,345
Bye.

1002
01:31:36,348 --> 01:31:38,307
You smell that, Bill?

1003
01:31:40,519 --> 01:31:42,686
Smells like someone died.

1004
01:31:44,439 --> 01:31:46,148
Jesus, Johnny.

1005
01:32:09,798 --> 01:32:11,173
Ike.

1006
01:32:12,843 --> 01:32:17,096
Take Stillwell and finish it.

1007
01:32:32,111 --> 01:32:34,529
Now, you take care of yourself.

1008
01:32:35,739 --> 01:32:38,908
- That's Virgil with the women.
- He's mine!

1009
01:32:39,034 --> 01:32:42,662
- All aboard!
- Hey, Mattie! Where's Wyatt?

1010
01:32:42,746 --> 01:32:44,956
Right behind you, Stillwell.

1011
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:47,750
No!

1012
01:33:02,391 --> 01:33:04,350
Sweet Jesus. Don't shoot.

1013
01:33:22,786 --> 01:33:24,913
All right, Clanton.

1014
01:33:24,997 --> 01:33:28,416
You called down the thunder.
Well, now you got it.

1015
01:33:31,003 --> 01:33:34,464
You see that?
It says "United States Marshal."

1016
01:33:34,548 --> 01:33:37,383
Wyatt. Please don't kill me. Please.

1017
01:33:37,468 --> 01:33:41,721
Take a good look at him, Ike,
'cause that's how you're gonna end up.

1018
01:33:43,432 --> 01:33:46,476
The Cowboys are finished.
You understand me?

1019
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,063
I see a red sash,
I kill the man wearin' it.

1020
01:33:50,147 --> 01:33:52,148
So run, you cur.

1021
01:33:52,983 --> 01:33:56,986
Run! Tell all the other curs
the law is comin'!

1022
01:33:58,447 --> 01:34:00,323
You tell 'em I'm comin'!

1023
01:34:00,407 --> 01:34:03,368
And Hell's comin' with me, you hear?

1024
01:34:03,452 --> 01:34:05,495
Hell's comin' with me!

1025
01:34:39,362 --> 01:34:41,196
Nobody move!

1026
01:34:41,281 --> 01:34:43,907
Nonsense. By all means, move.

1027
01:36:00,232 --> 01:36:01,775
Get down!

1028
01:36:13,913 --> 01:36:15,580
Hey, Wyatt!

1029
01:36:15,664 --> 01:36:17,791
How the hell are ya?

1030
01:36:30,054 --> 01:36:32,430
I got some boys over there behind ya!

1031
01:36:32,515 --> 01:36:35,850
Got you in a little crossfire.
How do ya like that?

1032
01:36:38,187 --> 01:36:41,147
Come on!
Think of something fast, would ya?

1033
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:47,195
Wyatt? Hey, Wyatt.

1034
01:36:47,988 --> 01:36:49,864
- No.
- Wyatt!

1035
01:36:51,867 --> 01:36:54,244
- No.
- Wyatt, what are you doin'?

1036
01:36:55,204 --> 01:36:56,663
Look at that.

1037
01:36:57,331 --> 01:36:58,706
Yeah.

1038
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:02,043
Come and get some, boy.

1039
01:37:06,715 --> 01:37:08,800
No! Let me!

1040
01:37:16,225 --> 01:37:17,642
No.

1041
01:37:17,852 --> 01:37:21,646
- Son of a bitch.
- No!

1042
01:37:26,569 --> 01:37:28,403
Jesus Christ!

1043
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:41,749
No. No!

1044
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,430
Did you ever see anything
like that before?

1045
01:37:56,514 --> 01:37:58,891
Hell, I ain't never even
heard of anything like that.

1046
01:37:58,975 --> 01:38:00,309
Nothin'.

1047
01:38:01,227 --> 01:38:02,811
Where is he?

1048
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:07,149
Down by the creek,

1049
01:38:07,233 --> 01:38:09,109
walkin' on water.

1050
01:38:09,194 --> 01:38:12,446
Well, let's hope he's got
another miracle up his sleeve.

1051
01:38:12,572 --> 01:38:16,158
'Cause if I know Ringo,
he's headed straight for us.

1052
01:38:17,702 --> 01:38:21,246
Well, if they were my brothers,
I'd want revenge too.

1053
01:38:21,331 --> 01:38:23,332
No. Make no mistake.

1054
01:38:24,918 --> 01:38:27,252
It's not revenge he's after.

1055
01:38:28,755 --> 01:38:30,715
It's a reckoning.

1056
01:38:41,143 --> 01:38:45,605
Doc. You ought to be in bed. What
the hell you doin' this for anyway?

1057
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,441
Wyatt Earp is my friend.

1058
01:38:49,777 --> 01:38:52,111
Hell, I got lots of friends.

1059
01:38:53,656 --> 01:38:55,073
I don't.

1060
01:39:14,927 --> 01:39:16,469
My God.

1061
01:39:19,557 --> 01:39:22,225
- Are you all right?
- What do you care?

1062
01:39:23,185 --> 01:39:25,520
It was your friends that did it.

1063
01:39:27,147 --> 01:39:30,984
Must've been Claiborne and Fuller.
They left here last night.

1064
01:39:31,985 --> 01:39:33,777
Oh, no.

1065
01:39:33,861 --> 01:39:36,488
They tried to take my watch.

1066
01:39:36,573 --> 01:39:39,658
He cursed them for cowards,
and they shot him.

1067
01:39:41,244 --> 01:39:43,787
I don't understand any of this.

1068
01:39:45,415 --> 01:39:47,416
I just know it's ugly.

1069
01:39:48,042 --> 01:39:49,835
You're all ugly,

1070
01:39:50,587 --> 01:39:52,754
and he was beautiful.

1071
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,844
He tried to bring something fine into
your ugly world, and you shot him for it.

1072
01:40:02,973 --> 01:40:05,016
Not that you care.

1073
01:40:16,445 --> 01:40:19,405
- Billy. Where you goin'?
- I'm not goin' with you.

1074
01:40:19,489 --> 01:40:21,782
Billy! Billy, get back here!

1075
01:40:21,867 --> 01:40:24,368
I'm sorry, sir,
but we got to have some law.

1076
01:40:24,453 --> 01:40:27,413
- Billy!
- Let him go. Who cares?

1077
01:40:28,540 --> 01:40:31,500
Get on out!
Get the hell outta here! Go on!

1078
01:40:32,252 --> 01:40:34,670
Party's over, boys. Let's go!

1079
01:40:49,936 --> 01:40:51,187
Halt.

1080
01:40:57,736 --> 01:41:00,446
Ringo and Behan are out in front.

1081
01:41:00,530 --> 01:41:03,407
There is about 30 of 'em.

1082
01:41:05,744 --> 01:41:07,912
They're all wearin' badges.

1083
01:41:09,414 --> 01:41:10,915
Christ.

1084
01:41:11,917 --> 01:41:14,418
We gotta find a place to hole up.

1085
01:41:16,004 --> 01:41:17,254
Doc.

1086
01:41:18,006 --> 01:41:19,923
Grab him.

1087
01:41:22,301 --> 01:41:23,635
I got him.

1088
01:41:24,887 --> 01:41:26,429
I got him!

1089
01:41:32,645 --> 01:41:34,312
Is this Henry Hooker's ranch?

1090
01:41:34,438 --> 01:41:37,273
That's right. And I'm Hooker.

1091
01:41:37,358 --> 01:41:39,609
We got a sick man.

1092
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:41,945
And our horses are done in.

1093
01:41:42,029 --> 01:41:45,615
Put him up at my place,
as long as it's just tonight.

1094
01:41:46,659 --> 01:41:48,451
We're in debt to you.

1095
01:41:56,794 --> 01:41:58,795
I know you boys
have got to keep movin',

1096
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:01,214
but he looks pretty bad to me.

1097
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:32,036
They got held up,
and their boss actor got killed.

1098
01:42:32,163 --> 01:42:35,832
They came here to water the horses,
then they'll push on.

1099
01:42:52,683 --> 01:42:56,644
I'm sorry about your friend.
And I'm sorry that I...

1100
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:59,731
I forgave you the moment you said it.

1101
01:42:59,815 --> 01:43:02,525
You did? Well...

1102
01:43:04,737 --> 01:43:06,069
Thank you.

1103
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:09,114
All set.

1104
01:43:11,534 --> 01:43:13,076
I have to go.

1105
01:43:16,414 --> 01:43:17,873
Wait.

1106
01:44:04,504 --> 01:44:06,421
What the hell is that?

1107
01:44:26,609 --> 01:44:28,443
They got McMasters!

1108
01:44:31,739 --> 01:44:35,492
Ringo wanted to make sure
he got your attention, Marshal!

1109
01:44:35,577 --> 01:44:37,536
He wants a straight-up fight,
just you and him,

1110
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:39,872
to settle this thing once and for all.

1111
01:44:39,956 --> 01:44:43,500
Oak grove at the mouth
of Silver Springs Canyon, 7:00!

1112
01:44:43,585 --> 01:44:46,211
You tell him I'll be there!

1113
01:44:46,296 --> 01:44:48,755
- Are you crazy?
- I'll be there!

1114
01:44:50,841 --> 01:44:52,425
It's not finished.

1115
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:11,359
After I'm done with Wyatt Earp,

1116
01:45:11,485 --> 01:45:15,405
take your Cowboys and finish off
Creek Johnson and Texas Jack.

1117
01:45:17,325 --> 01:45:19,326
You burn 'em, Ike.

1118
01:45:21,787 --> 01:45:22,996
Burn 'em all.

1119
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:25,874
Hell, Johnny,
he ain't even gonna show.

1120
01:45:28,711 --> 01:45:30,211
He'll show.

1121
01:45:33,507 --> 01:45:37,552
I spent my whole life not knowin'
what I wanted outta life,

1122
01:45:38,095 --> 01:45:40,138
just chasin' my tail.

1123
01:45:40,556 --> 01:45:44,100
Now for the first time
I know exactly what I want,

1124
01:45:44,185 --> 01:45:45,560
and who.

1125
01:45:47,897 --> 01:45:50,774
And that's the damnable misery of it.

1126
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:57,989
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc?

1127
01:45:58,074 --> 01:46:01,076
What makes him
do the things he does?

1128
01:46:01,202 --> 01:46:03,203
A man like Ringo

1129
01:46:04,372 --> 01:46:08,208
got a great empty hole
right through the middle of him.

1130
01:46:10,211 --> 01:46:14,464
He can never kill enough
or steal enough

1131
01:46:14,548 --> 01:46:17,384
or inflict enough pain to ever fill it.

1132
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:20,220
What does he need?

1133
01:46:21,472 --> 01:46:23,390
Revenge.

1134
01:46:26,811 --> 01:46:28,228
For what?

1135
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:35,777
Bein' born.

1136
01:46:50,458 --> 01:46:52,209
It all happened so fast with Curly Bill

1137
01:46:52,293 --> 01:46:53,669
I didn't really have time
to think about it,

1138
01:46:53,753 --> 01:46:57,047
but I've had plenty of time
to think about this.

1139
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:06,181
I can't beat him, can I?

1140
01:47:07,892 --> 01:47:09,101
No.

1141
01:47:16,526 --> 01:47:19,486
Wait. I'm goin' with ya.

1142
01:47:25,994 --> 01:47:29,413
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1143
01:47:30,331 --> 01:47:32,499
I'm sorry, Wyatt.

1144
01:47:32,584 --> 01:47:34,752
It's all right, Doc.

1145
01:47:38,465 --> 01:47:41,050
What's it like to wear one of those?

1146
01:48:08,412 --> 01:48:09,913
Don't worry.

1147
01:48:09,997 --> 01:48:13,208
They want him,
they gotta come over us first.

1148
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:44,488
He's waitin' for you by the big oak,
quarter mile up that trail.

1149
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:53,205
They're not givin' ya any safe-conduct.

1150
01:48:53,915 --> 01:48:57,960
Shootin' starts, you better kick east
to the New Mexico line.

1151
01:49:00,672 --> 01:49:02,714
I ain't got the words.

1152
01:49:02,841 --> 01:49:04,716
I know.

1153
01:49:05,385 --> 01:49:06,885
Me neither.

1154
01:49:15,562 --> 01:49:17,146
Well.

1155
01:49:23,778 --> 01:49:26,321
I didn't think ya had it in you.

1156
01:49:26,406 --> 01:49:28,490
I'm your huckleberry.

1157
01:49:32,162 --> 01:49:34,663
Why, Johnny Ringo,

1158
01:49:35,498 --> 01:49:38,876
you look like somebody
just walked over your grave.

1159
01:49:40,753 --> 01:49:43,045
Fight's not with you, Holliday.

1160
01:49:43,130 --> 01:49:47,800
I'll beg to differ, sir. We started
a game we never got to finish.

1161
01:49:48,927 --> 01:49:51,345
Play for blood, remember?

1162
01:49:53,557 --> 01:49:55,600
I was just foolin' about.

1163
01:49:57,686 --> 01:49:59,312
I wasn't.

1164
01:50:00,856 --> 01:50:03,065
And this time

1165
01:50:04,109 --> 01:50:05,651
it's legal.

1166
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:17,329
All right, lunger. Let's do it.

1167
01:50:51,948 --> 01:50:53,406
Say when.

1168
01:51:12,218 --> 01:51:14,761
Come on. Come on!

1169
01:51:15,763 --> 01:51:17,555
Oh, Johnny. Come on!

1170
01:51:23,771 --> 01:51:26,856
You're no daisy. You're no daisy at all!

1171
01:51:28,526 --> 01:51:30,026
Poor soul.

1172
01:51:31,362 --> 01:51:33,780
You were just too high-strung.

1173
01:51:44,458 --> 01:51:47,919
I'm afraid the strain
was more than he could bear.

1174
01:51:55,803 --> 01:51:59,222
Oh, I wasn't quite
as sick as I made out.

1175
01:52:03,601 --> 01:52:05,185
Good God.

1176
01:52:11,901 --> 01:52:13,902
My hypocrisy goes only so far.

1177
01:52:19,659 --> 01:52:21,076
All right.

1178
01:52:22,370 --> 01:52:23,662
Let's finish it.

1179
01:52:23,747 --> 01:52:28,334
Indeed, sir. The last charge
of Wyatt Earp and his immortals.

1180
01:53:21,471 --> 01:53:23,597
Come on! Get going!

1181
01:53:28,686 --> 01:53:30,354
Look at this!

1182
01:54:51,893 --> 01:54:53,477
Hello, Wyatt.

1183
01:54:54,061 --> 01:54:56,438
Father Feeney and I were just

1184
01:54:57,356 --> 01:55:01,193
investigating the mysteries
of the Church of Rome.

1185
01:55:03,070 --> 01:55:08,033
It appears my hypocrisy
knows no bounds.

1186
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:12,621
You're no hypocrite, Doc.
You just like to sound like one.

1187
01:55:13,331 --> 01:55:15,582
I brought you somethin'.

1188
01:55:21,589 --> 01:55:25,258
Well, let's see. Where are we today?

1189
01:55:25,384 --> 01:55:28,345
I'm $17 down to you.

1190
01:55:28,429 --> 01:55:32,349
- Two bits a hand. Stud?
- You keep comin' back here.

1191
01:55:32,433 --> 01:55:35,434
I told you not to, and I meant it.

1192
01:55:35,519 --> 01:55:39,104
You're the only person
I can afford to lose to any more.

1193
01:55:41,358 --> 01:55:43,526
How we feelin' today, Doc?

1194
01:55:44,903 --> 01:55:46,987
I'm dying. How are you?

1195
01:55:47,948 --> 01:55:49,823
Pretty much the same.

1196
01:55:50,575 --> 01:55:53,202
So now we add self-pity
to your list of frailties.

1197
01:55:53,286 --> 01:55:54,870
All right, Doc.

1198
01:55:54,955 --> 01:55:57,623
All right, how many cards you want?

1199
01:55:58,291 --> 01:56:00,626
I don't want to play any more.

1200
01:56:02,295 --> 01:56:04,046
How many?

1201
01:56:04,548 --> 01:56:07,967
Damn you. You're the most fallible,

1202
01:56:09,886 --> 01:56:12,555
stubborn, self-deluded,

1203
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:14,974
bull-headed man
I've ever known in my entire life.

1204
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:16,433
I call.

1205
01:56:17,227 --> 01:56:19,186
- You win.
- Yet withal,

1206
01:56:19,729 --> 01:56:24,275
you're the only human being in my
entire life who ever gave me hope.

1207
01:56:30,824 --> 01:56:33,492
I was in love once.

1208
01:56:35,495 --> 01:56:37,246
My first cousin.

1209
01:56:37,872 --> 01:56:40,332
She was 15.

1210
01:56:43,503 --> 01:56:45,212
We were both so...

1211
01:56:46,631 --> 01:56:48,632
That's good, Doc.

1212
01:56:49,426 --> 01:56:51,635
That's good. What happened?

1213
01:56:55,181 --> 01:56:58,183
She joined a convent over the affair.

1214
01:56:59,019 --> 01:57:01,395
She was all I ever wanted.

1215
01:57:03,898 --> 01:57:06,025
What did you want?

1216
01:57:06,651 --> 01:57:08,903
Just to live a normal life.

1217
01:57:09,697 --> 01:57:13,199
There's no normal life, Wyatt.
There's just life.

1218
01:57:14,577 --> 01:57:16,578
Now get on with it.

1219
01:57:17,496 --> 01:57:19,039
Don't know how.

1220
01:57:21,416 --> 01:57:24,251
Sure you do. Say goodbye to me.

1221
01:57:26,254 --> 01:57:28,714
Go grab that spirited actress

1222
01:57:28,798 --> 01:57:30,674
and make her your own.

1223
01:57:32,093 --> 01:57:35,429
Take that beauty and run,
and don't look back.

1224
01:57:35,513 --> 01:57:39,308
Live every second.
Live right up to the hilt.

1225
01:57:40,226 --> 01:57:42,144
Live, Wyatt.

1226
01:57:43,063 --> 01:57:44,730
Live for me.

1227
01:57:46,566 --> 01:57:49,401
Wyatt, if you ever were my friend,

1228
01:57:49,486 --> 01:57:52,905
if you ever had even
the slightest feelin' for me,

1229
01:57:52,989 --> 01:57:54,531
leave now.

1230
01:57:55,116 --> 01:57:56,617
Leave now.

1231
01:58:01,498 --> 01:58:02,998
Please?

1232
01:58:15,178 --> 01:58:17,763
Thanks for always bein' there, Doc.

1233
01:58:45,959 --> 01:58:47,710
I'll be damned.

1234
01:58:50,463 --> 01:58:52,131
This is funny.

1235
01:59:12,735 --> 01:59:15,319
I never thought I would see
Gilbert and Sullivan performed

1236
01:59:15,404 --> 01:59:17,321
right here in Denver.

1237
01:59:18,657 --> 01:59:20,992
- Good night, Josie.
- Good night.

1238
01:59:21,785 --> 01:59:23,326
Good show.

1239
01:59:40,178 --> 01:59:43,263
Ya ever see the sun come up
over the Rockies?

1240
01:59:43,848 --> 01:59:47,392
It hits all of a sudden,
and below there's California.

1241
01:59:48,603 --> 01:59:51,354
And you swear
you're lookin' at heaven.

1242
01:59:59,197 --> 02:00:01,573
I have nothing left,

1243
02:00:01,699 --> 02:00:03,867
nothing to give you.

1244
02:00:04,827 --> 02:00:08,163
I have no pride, no dignity.

1245
02:00:09,415 --> 02:00:13,210
No money. I don't even know
how we'll make a living, but...

1246
02:00:18,216 --> 02:00:21,218
I promise I'll love you
the rest of your life.

1247
02:00:36,234 --> 02:00:39,903
Don't worry, Wyatt. My family's rich.

1248
02:00:47,286 --> 02:00:49,788
What shall we do first?

1249
02:00:49,872 --> 02:00:53,041
What you wanted to do
the first night we met.

1250
02:00:53,125 --> 02:00:54,501
Remember?

1251
02:00:57,462 --> 02:00:59,672
May I have this dance?

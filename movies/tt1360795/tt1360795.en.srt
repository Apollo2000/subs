1
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,277
Yes, this is "Nam Hyun Soo's Afternoon Program".

2
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:37,057
Hello?

3
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:39,847
Hi! You know how women have a sixth sense?

4
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:41,337
Yes! of course!

5
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:45,357
Oh my god, well, he totally got caught! He was holding her hand and kissing her!

6
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,417
Wow, and you guys are in the same school?

7
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:48,777
Wah, he completely doesn't have an manners or concepts

8
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:50,627
Seriously, he really doesn't!

9
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:53,097
Anything can happen when you live for so long...

10
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:55,147
Aha...Miss Lee Hana, what school do you attend right now?

11
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:56,897
Right now? I'm in Eung-Hang elementary school.

12
00:03:58,277 --> 00:04:02,517
The water splashed fourth a little elementary school kid!

13
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:09,117
Yes, this is "Nam Hye Soo's radio program"

14
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:16,247
Anyway,this is how I feel. What's most important for a man is responsibility.

15
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:20,647
Next...ahhh, this person is calling.

16
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:24,147
The next person is our lively, strong, main character.

17
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:28,427
She is our generation's most popular and single mother Miss Huang Jung Nam.

18
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:29,987
Miss Huang Jung Nam?

19
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,117
Mr. PD

20
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:33,447
Yeah, it's all done?

21
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:34,557
Hello?

22
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:35,867
Yes.

23
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,577
Yes! Jung Nam sshi, Hello!

24
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,887
Yes.

25
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,367
Yes! Jung Nam sshi! It's a pleasure to talk with you!

26
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:44,257
This is the first time you are calling, right?

27
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:48,037
Sounds like you're on the way to somewhere.

28
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:49,637
I'm going to meet my father.

29
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:51,917
Ah Yes! You are finally going!

30
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:54,097
Yes! That is a good idea.

31
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:55,197
Is it?

32
00:04:55,297 --> 00:04:56,877
Of course, Jung Nam sshi!

33
00:04:56,977 --> 00:05:00,687
When you sent in the letter three months ago, didn't I tell you?

34
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:02,867
You should go look for your father!

35
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,847
When you didn't know him, it was okay.

36
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:06,867
Now that you know who he is, you should go.

37
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:08,597
Then I'm really going to go...

38
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:10,587
Of course you must go.

39
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:16,127
Jung Nam sshi, when you meet your father, what is the first thing you want to do for him?

40
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:18,307
What should I do?

41
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:19,967
Excuse me?

42
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,277
Uh, when a man lives alone... food! Yes, food.

43
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,477
3 meals a day.

44
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:32,987
When he wakes up in the morning, breakfast is already prepared.

45
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,007
Ok, I will definitely do that.

46
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,737
Wow, I'm so envious!

47
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:39,327
Jung Nam sshi, when you meet your dad, what do you hope for?

48
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,287
I want to sing.

49
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:45,677
Sing? Are you saying you want to become a singer?

50
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:48,897
Oh, so you have a talent in music

51
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:50,457
Yes, I do.

52
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:55,117
- Wow, then we should listen to Jung Nam sshi sing for us
- Hong dae yah, review it.

53
00:05:55,217 --> 00:05:57,997
- But because time is tight,we will not be able to hear you sing today.
- Ok!

54
00:05:58,097 --> 00:06:02,257
Jung Nam sshi, do you know the program at our radio called "Boyung Radio"

55
00:06:02,357 --> 00:06:03,477
Yes, I know of it.

56
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:05,417
Please participate in that program!

57
00:06:05,517 --> 00:06:08,267
If you win in the Gaeul Wang Juwon,

58
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,307
We can certainly help you realize your dream to be a singer.

59
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,017
yes, please participate in it.

60
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,267
Okay.

61
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:19,877
Ok Jung Nam sshi. Are there any last words you want to say to your dad on the radio?

62
00:06:19,977 --> 00:06:22,617
My child sleepwalks once in a while. Don't be surprised.

63
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:27,517
Ok, I'm hanging up.

64
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:34,877
Umm..yeah, ok, well...children sleepwalk. it's ok..don't worry.

65
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,507
I hope you continue to send us your story.

66
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,607
Thank you so so much for calling in today.

67
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,197
Thanks.

68
00:06:43,477 --> 00:06:50,657
At an age when she should be nourishing her dream, 22-year-old Jung Nam sshi is raising her son.

69
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:55,907
Now her father who will lovingly accept her and her dreams.

70
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:58,317
And an adorable grandson.

71
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:07,257
We at "Nam Hyun Soo Radio" hope that Jung Nam sshi will always be filled with happiness.

72
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:09,897
I told her to go and she went!

73
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:14,177
Man, what is that guy gonna do now? A child AND a grandchild?! wow...

74
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:16,067
Could such a thing happen out of the blue?

75
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:18,967
Sunbae, you should be careful too! she might come looking for you...

76
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:22,817
Hey, I'm a pro. PRO.

77
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:27,047
What day is today?

78
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,457
The day that you shoot a CF (commercial)!

79
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:30,227
BINGOOO!!!!

80
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:51,387
Cut!

81
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:55,417
Ok!

82
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:00,967
Did it come out well?

83
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:05,187
I told you I didn't want to shoot with these little boogers...

84
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,667
I want...well, you know...

85
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,637
What? What are you talking about?

86
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:12,947
Oh yeah! Kim Joonyoung! What ever happened with that video scandal?

87
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:17,837
Obviously there was chaos! Screaming and then getting fired.

88
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:19,817
Ehhh, yeah, he "ate" so much money from others...

89
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,007
So it was publicized that he got caught, huh?

90
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:26,967
Yeah, that reporter Bong Pil Choong really got the story this time.

91
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,747
That's his specialty. Wow, what a hyena of a guy.

92
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:34,397
- So the whole's story out about him, right?
- Yes, I guess...

93
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:36,897
Wait, but I just saw that guys a few moments ago.

94
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:41,047
Hey, Hyena's over there...

95
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,027
(ahh...crap...)
Oh hey! Reporter Bong! What are you doing here?

96
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:53,397
Oh, there was a smell in the next set!

97
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,897
Smell? Oh, you must be joking!

98
00:08:55,997 --> 00:08:58,097
Oh, I heard you chose a wedding date!

99
00:08:58,197 --> 00:08:59,557
Yeah! In the Autumn.

100
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:01,377
You'll come, right?

101
00:09:01,477 --> 00:09:02,737
Of course I have to go

102
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:08,707
Oh, but uh, I heard the big story about Kim Joonyoung...

103
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:11,167
Yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna get punched by Joonyoung for this...

104
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:15,237
When a reporter reports the truth, sometimes he'll get hit for it!

105
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:19,337
And plus, he's always getting entangled with girls

106
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:22,727
You know what? Now that I see, you never have any scandals.

107
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:25,007
you're good at hiding things...

108
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,507
What do you mean hide? What do I have to hide?

109
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:30,487
Please, make me a scandal for god sakes!

110
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:32,347
So I can be on the headline of the news!

111
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:33,647
(Last sunday...)

112
00:09:33,747 --> 00:09:34,867
(Kim Joonyoung was caught on video with a girl...)

113
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,697
How are you so sexy?

114
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,557
(His manager has begun to stop the spread of the video...)

115
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:40,947
Of course! I'm watching right now.

116
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:45,187
I told gyung-bi that my cousin's coming over.

117
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,777
I will surely make you into my slave.

118
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,017
Who are you?

119
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:44,727
- It's you right?
- What?

120
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:47,167
"Nam Hyun Soo's Afternoon Show"

121
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,437
No, I'm not

122
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:55,227
I think you found the wrong house...

123
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:57,177
I'm Jung Nam

124
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,277
Who?

125
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:01,117
Huang Jung Nam

126
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:02,157
So what?

127
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:06,337
The person who called your radio station. Single mother.

128
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,807
AHHH!!! Huang Jung Nam!

129
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,767
Oh, you couldn't meet your father huh!

130
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,007
Uh, why are you here?

131
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,277
Huang Bogyung is my mother...

132
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:23,337
So?

133
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:24,537
Don't you know?

134
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:25,637
Am I supposed to know?

135
00:11:25,737 --> 00:11:26,987
You should know...

136
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,697
I don't think I would know...

137
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:35,987
When Nam Hyunsoo was in the third year of high school...

138
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,097
The "nuna" (older sister) next door

139
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,157
5 years older than you

140
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:44,077
Nam hyun soo's first time...

141
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:56,447
For me, this girl really seems like my daughter!

142
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:58,677
During my childhood, my materal grandparents had a house there!

143
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:02,347
Your father had you when he was in his third year of high school?

144
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:10,667
Never listened to my friends...we were in the same neighborhood...
(cluster of thoughts all together)

145
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:14,667
Please go meet your father.

146
00:12:42,547 --> 00:12:44,467
Say hi to him, your grandpa

147
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:49,767
- GRANDPA!!!!
- WAIT, WHOA, HOLD ON, DON'T COME! DON'T COME!

148
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:54,027
- GRANDPA!!!
- Hold on! Stop!

149
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:12,247
What do I do?!

150
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,407
Go! Go! Hurry up!

151
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:02,567
Listen now. It's not going to take long.

152
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:06,147
Just be quiet and don't move. Ok?

153
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:11,377
- But he has to go pee---
- Let him pee in his pants!!!

154
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,887
Please, please?!

155
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,507
Oh my, look at your sweat dripping

156
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:51,907
Were you trying to make a romantic atmosphere?

157
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:00,447
Um, hey, about today--

158
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:04,247
Today, should we just go all out?

159
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,447
My goodness, oppa, this is a good time...

160
00:15:10,947 --> 00:15:12,717
Are we going to keep standing like this?

161
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:21,607
It's just the robot vacuum.

162
00:15:33,437 --> 00:15:36,167
Automatic tub cleaner...

163
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:39,717
It's so well-known...

164
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:42,047
I'm not such an easy woman

165
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:05,847
I have something very important to tell you.

166
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:10,647
Say it...

167
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:14,937
Let's break up.

168
00:16:27,747 --> 00:16:29,067
Did the guest leave?

169
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:38,547
Listen carefully. I'll talk slowly

170
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,207
I like it faster...

171
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:43,417
Speak.

172
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:47,407
Ok, if we look at this situation calmly...

173
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,177
- You, young lady, ---
- I'm a mother.

174
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:53,377
Yeah, a mother! Anyway, this isn't it!

175
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,457
Ok, sure sometimes there are those type of people

176
00:16:55,557 --> 00:17:00,177
When we (while broadcasting) talk about a situation for too long, I become comfortable, like a friend, oppa, uncle...

177
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,187
And a father.

178
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,847
THAT'S NOT IT!!!

179
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:05,347
How could I possible have a big daughter like you?!

180
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:11,677
Ok, Bo gyung nuna...it's sad that her life became like that. It's too sad.

181
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:14,237
Just a moment ago, I was crying like crazy over there.

182
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:18,097
But with her, I only...just once. Just once!

183
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,637
I remember very clearly.

184
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:25,347
Eh, it's not me! I didn't have that much stamina that time either to plant a seed!

185
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:26,727
Well, you did plant!

186
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:29,217
What skills does a 3rd year in high school have to make a kid?!

187
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:31,407
For me, it's 1st year of middle school...

188
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:33,027
Oh my God-- Who are you?!

189
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:34,487
I'm Huang gi dong!!!

190
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,127
Not that!

191
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:40,447
Young lady, look. You're breaking the law right now.

192
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,697
Entering a private residence is a 3 yr. imprisonment or a $5 mill. fine

193
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,307
You wanna go to jail?

194
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:49,617
You really want us to go?

195
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,037
You shouldn't have even come.

196
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,367
Even though it's his bed time?

197
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:53,617
It's my bedtime too.

198
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:54,887
Our car's out of order too...

199
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:58,877
Always be healthy...

200
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:11,687
Actor Kim joonyoung..video scandal?!

201
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:15,347
Man, he's finished, finished!

202
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:18,227
How did THAT happen?

203
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:21,277
Good night, Grandpa!

204
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,057
Good morning, Grandpa!

205
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:22,287
Didn't you say that I should prepare meals for you?

206
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:31,587
There's a lot to eat. Eat a lot.

207
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:36,577
Hey, I thought about it a long while yesterday night.

208
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:38,667
Young lady, You're not my daughter.

209
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:39,797
I told you I'm not a young lady.

210
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:42,057
Your surname is Huang. Mine is Nam.

211
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,727
My mom's last name is Huang, that's why mine is Huang too.

212
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,617
Huang Bo Gyung, Huang Jung Nam, Huang Gi Dong

213
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:48,517
We don't look alike at all!

214
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:50,757
Look! You have a double eyeli---

215
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:55,937
When I smile, you can't see my eyes!

216
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:03,617
Lips! You're lips are completely different!

217
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:05,467
Thank God

218
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:07,847
You want to do a paternity test?

219
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,127
They say that a blood test is the most accurate.

220
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:10,447
- If you're not my daughter--
- Then what?

221
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:11,807
We'll go to the police stattion.

222
00:21:11,907 --> 00:21:15,017
On one side, the actor and main character of the video, kim joon y--

223
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,387
Why do you keep insisting your my daughter without any evid--

224
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:30,697
Wow, this is completely...

225
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:33,797
This kind of story is seriously worth broadcasting

226
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:36,507
I told you something like this would happen!

227
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:39,177
I have no one else I can trust but you, hyung (older brother).

228
00:21:39,277 --> 00:21:41,027
They do this kind of stuff in a dog house huh...

229
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:44,877
Young lady, this isn't a dog house.

230
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:47,677
Oh, a dog hospital.

231
00:21:50,237 --> 00:21:52,807
There's a resemblance in personality....

232
00:21:53,797 --> 00:21:55,267
I can already feel it.

233
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:57,477
We don't need to do a blood test.

234
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:59,027
I'm feeling the answer come to me right now.

235
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:01,057
"I'm Nam Hyun Soo's daughter".

236
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:02,567
Whatever, when is the result coming out?

237
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,027
In 10 days.

238
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:06,487
Hey Mister, you used to play the drums, right?

239
00:22:06,587 --> 00:22:07,707
Oh, that?

240
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:10,147
You were so cool at that time...

241
00:22:11,487 --> 00:22:13,867
Well, you're pretty cool now too...

242
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:20,137
So, uh, what song did you think I was the coolest in?

243
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:21,517
Do you know?

244
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,627
You remember me?

245
00:22:24,437 --> 00:22:28,647
Hey, your daughter's so pretty!!!

246
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:30,687
What's your name?

247
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:32,137
I'm Huang Gi Dong!!!

248
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:34,057
Hey! Gi dong! Come here, have some candy!

249
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:38,087
What flavor do you want? Orange? Grape?

250
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:33,987
She is your daughter. 100%.

251
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:43,457
Let's make a house for you guys where you used to live.

252
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:46,227
A child should live in a familiar place.

253
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:51,057
You scratched, right? You scratched yourself just now!

254
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:56,707
That's atopia! You'll keep scratching and then you'll die!

255
00:23:56,807 --> 00:24:02,427
That's why you should go live in the countryside. The air's no good here and the cars fly

256
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:06,967
If you go outside, the kids break their legs and arms, and it's just a mess!

257
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:09,347
Go outside and look for yourself!

258
00:24:38,907 --> 00:24:40,207
Sit.

259
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:51,267
You must've had a hard time raising a child on your own, right?

260
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:55,317
Well, yeah...

261
00:24:55,417 --> 00:25:02,077
Actually, your mother was my first and my last love.

262
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:05,257
Although we were deeply in love

263
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,177
We could only break up in the end

264
00:25:11,157 --> 00:25:14,687
Your mother, Bo Gyung nuna..

265
00:25:14,787 --> 00:25:16,777
Possibly hid you because of this.

266
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,547
She thought she would interfere with the future of the person she loves.

267
00:25:21,997 --> 00:25:26,297
It would've been better if I knew back then

268
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:28,267
Sorry.

269
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:49,757
I sing really well. I can cook.

270
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:55,377
When I was young, I never rebelled. I just got pregnant.

271
00:25:58,077 --> 00:26:02,227
- As you can see, I'm the loveable, cutsy type.
- Ah, yes...

272
00:26:07,387 --> 00:26:10,947
I'm going to go. Don't hold onto me!

273
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:14,807
I respect your decision.

274
00:26:16,037 --> 00:26:17,757
Daddy should have a glass also.

275
00:26:28,277 --> 00:26:30,477
How could something like this happen to me?

276
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:32,817
Right!

277
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:39,887
Oh! Huang gi dong! Have a glass of alcohol! Just one glass!

278
00:26:39,987 --> 00:26:41,547
What are you saying to a kid!

279
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:43,747
Oh, it's okay! don't be so strict with kids!

280
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:45,667
- ok, 1 more bottle!
- 1 more bottle!!!

281
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:22,107
- Gran---
- Shhh!!!

282
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:34,447
I have a meeting...

283
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:41,097
You remember the promise from yesterday, right?

284
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:43,457
Uh huh, yeah.

285
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:47,977
Anyway, o well until the end of this month...

286
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:52,107
I said I would leave...

287
00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:54,507
So, we'll meet next week?

288
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,287
Yes, the meeting is until 5PM.

289
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:57,167
- Please check the invitations.
- Ok.

290
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:58,667
I heard there's a really talented singer.

291
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:00,457
Yeah, she's totally a professional.

292
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:02,447
Hey senior, you have to take a look.
(her name's Huang Jae In)

293
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:05,977
Please, can you guys just take care of this

294
00:29:07,327 --> 00:29:09,447
Oh, also, the story about the single mother Huang Jung Nam...

295
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:12,497
Netizens are getting restless because we aren't updating her story.

296
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:14,087
The ratings have dropped for our show too...

297
00:29:14,647 --> 00:29:18,337
Hey, you really think because we didn't update her story, our ratings are dropping?

298
00:29:18,797 --> 00:29:21,117
Why not? People listen to the story for fun...

299
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:23,587
Last time the manager also said that...

300
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:26,737
Oh geez, since when did he show so much concern?

301
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:29,257
If he's so concerned, maybe he should be the DJ

302
00:29:29,957 --> 00:29:31,587
Oh, there was that method huh...

303
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:42,057
You keep putting on commercials. Of course the radio program's no fun.

304
00:29:42,887 --> 00:29:44,637
Um, I mean, when did I...

305
00:29:45,257 --> 00:29:48,067
Hey, didn't you tell him yet?

306
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:57,277
You read her story to everyone, which made the rating shoot up.

307
00:29:57,907 --> 00:30:02,367
- Do you understand?
- That's why, ummm manager, instead of just sitting...

308
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,187
Why don't we look for her?

309
00:30:04,817 --> 00:30:07,547
I have a friend who's an experting at investigating people. His name is Ho Dong Gu.

310
00:30:08,147 --> 00:30:10,927
Why don't we take the opportunity to find her, bring her to the studio, and make her a special guest?

311
00:30:11,027 --> 00:30:12,347
And her father

312
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:13,777
Good idea! Good idea!

313
00:30:14,257 --> 00:30:17,587
It's not a big deal to find a person. It's not like it's against the law or anything either...

314
00:30:17,737 --> 00:30:18,707
Right!

315
00:30:19,347 --> 00:30:22,437
That's not a bad idea, bringing her to the studio as a guest...

316
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:25,527
Should I contact my friend right now? I'll contact him and--

317
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:27,217
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CONTACT?!

318
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:33,627
I mean, isn't every situation beautiful on its own?

319
00:30:34,117 --> 00:30:39,627
There should always be an air of suspense...if we bring her to the studio, then it ends right there!

320
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:42,647
Right? Am I right?

321
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:54,387
- Aren't you going to continue your story?
- Huh?

322
00:30:57,997 --> 00:31:00,207
I'm talking about the radio...

323
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:03,057
I'm asking if you're going to continue your story

324
00:31:04,807 --> 00:31:06,347
When was I so self-centered and cheap like that? Huh?

325
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,007
You took the credit card away from me, remember?

326
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:09,577
What's so cheap about taking back my own credit card?!

327
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:11,017
That's called being cheap!

328
00:31:11,117 --> 00:31:13,377
That's not being cheap! I mean, I took back my own--

329
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:16,057
Oh my God, Ok, I'll delete it! Look, it's all deleted already

330
00:31:16,257 --> 00:31:17,647
Of course you have to delete it all!

331
00:31:18,107 --> 00:31:19,897
I have nothing to write...absolutely nothing to write about...

332
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:25,197
Geez, move over, move!

333
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:29,337
If you write a story, you have to put some feeling into it!

334
00:31:30,217 --> 00:31:33,887
The generous father gave paid off my credit card bill and said this:

335
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:38,267
You think that this bill is something? If you guys want, I'll do anything for you!

336
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:40,747
He smiled graciously

337
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:47,887
I, who previously didn't have a sense of filiality and only knew of money, decided:
I have to make money and stop burdening my father.

338
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:50,837
Will he be alright? Oh god, my baby...

339
00:31:50,937 --> 00:31:52,147
Wow, he sure is making a big deal...

340
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:53,557
Excuse me?!

341
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:59,267
If anyone is looking for me...PLEASE DON'T.

342
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:03,787
A story has it's own beauty when it is happening.

343
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:05,967
Laundry!

344
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:19,047
I can't emphasize enough how much he loves kids!

345
00:32:19,617 --> 00:32:25,827
My child is noisy and disruptive. He takes up the whole sofa and watches TV all day.

346
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:29,787
But my father never fights with him, and always gives into him.

347
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:35,297
Sometimes I wonder if "sacrifice" and "devotion" are his other names.

348
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:47,987
Get me water.

349
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:51,087
You never even brought us to the amusement park.

350
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:54,307
This is all BS

351
00:32:56,427 --> 00:32:59,267
"At the department store"...DEPARTMENT STORE?!

352
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:02,587
Fine, we'll go, ok? We'll go!

353
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:18,857
Wow, my father is so hardworking. He even brought me namebrand clothes!

354
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,177
Thank you so much for your story, Miss Huang Jung Nam.

355
00:33:21,277 --> 00:33:22,837
Ok, here's the next section of our radio program!

356
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:25,267
Our afternoon program!

357
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:31,137
We'll meet our very talented music group, who passed through some hard competition!

358
00:33:31,237 --> 00:33:32,907
We'll also listen to some commercials meanwhile

359
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,157
Hello
(Oh my God, it's Nam hyun soo!)

360
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:49,267
Hello

361
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:52,817
You came!

362
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:03,147
Oh hey, it's me.

363
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:07,097
(yes, yes, oh I see, the left side...)

364
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:07,907
What are you saying...

365
00:34:08,157 --> 00:34:09,307
Why did you call?

366
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:10,867
Why do you think I called?

367
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:14,347
Um, yeah, what do you feel like eating tonight?

368
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:16,497
You choose, so I can buy it.

369
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:17,577
I want meat!

370
00:34:17,677 --> 00:34:18,977
Eat chobab. ok? Chobab (rice wrapped by tofu)

371
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:23,197
But I want to eat meat.

372
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:26,117
Sorry! I'm sorry!

373
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:43,097
Senior! Senior! lines! lines!

374
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:46,947
Umm, uh, yeah, in the next section of our program, we will--

375
00:34:54,857 --> 00:35:00,197
We have a group of five who are here for the music challenge.

376
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:20,697
Wow, and there you are!

377
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:23,597
Determination is a big part of winning

378
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:26,187
Of course, the netizen vote online determines the results.

379
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:28,447
But this is already...

380
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:31,237
Ok, we have heard all of our contestants now.

381
00:35:32,427 --> 00:35:33,937
Uh wait, there's still one contestant.

382
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:36,937
Miss Huang Jae In? (pronounced like Jane)

383
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:40,927
Yes, hello.

384
00:35:41,027 --> 00:35:42,737
Your name is very special!

385
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:46,487
Is it the same Jane as in "John and Jane"?

386
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:52,377
My mother gave me the name. It means to "be someone" (become big, famous).

387
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:56,887
Yes, we really hope that you become famous. Now please, just come onto the stage quickly.

388
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:02,507
Yes, the program that everyone is watching, "Bo Young In radio"

389
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:06,097
THE WHOLE COUNTRY is listening, so don't be nervous

390
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:11,217
The song is Choi Young Joon's "Perhaps that"

391
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:19,117
Oh well..wow, you like umm...very OLD style music. OLD concepts...

392
00:36:19,817 --> 00:36:22,747
Ok, do it. Ready, START.

393
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:10,447
Ahaha, well, she got to nervous so...pitifully, the next--

394
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:36,967
¢ No matter how I think, that was probably love ¢

395
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:41,847
¢ A memory that is already erasing ¢

396
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:46,687
¢ Now ¢

397
00:37:46,837 --> 00:37:49,277
¢ I finally understand that feeling ¢

398
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:54,607
¢ Now all that is left is your shadow ¢

399
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:58,907
¢ Now... all that's left ¢

400
00:37:59,047 --> 00:38:01,117
¢ Is the cold image of your back ¢

401
00:38:01,277 --> 00:38:04,827
¢ It leaves me shivering ¢

402
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:07,237
¢ And so sad ¢

403
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:11,517
¢ For a long time, I stared at the gate ¢

404
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:13,657
¢ Thinking you would come by my side ¢

405
00:38:13,777 --> 00:38:18,657
¢ In the morning, I looked out the window and said ¢

406
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:25,067
¢ That thing called love, that overlaps with time ¢

407
00:38:25,277 --> 00:38:30,817
¢ That goes by swiftly and quietly like the wind ¢

408
00:38:30,997 --> 00:38:37,057
¢ A love like that, I miss so much ¢

409
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:43,117
¢ All I have left are my feelings¢

410
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:53,057
You can sing a bit...

411
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:53,787
Yes, I do.

412
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:54,747
Don't go to the competition

413
00:38:54,827 --> 00:38:55,837
I will.

414
00:38:55,937 --> 00:38:58,667
I was really wrong. Don't compete.

415
00:38:58,787 --> 00:39:00,347
Just treat it as my mistake.

416
00:39:00,427 --> 00:39:03,587
Why?! Why of all programs, our program?!

417
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:05,587
You told me that I should definitely participate.

418
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:09,457
Ok. Ok I admit that.

419
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:11,227
These days, it's all about your luck.

420
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,357
If you hold on to your luck, your ratings go up too.

421
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:14,717
Let's say you're sick!

422
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,597
Appendix! Let's say your appendix exploded!

423
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:19,057
But my appendix already exploded 2 years ago...

424
00:39:21,587 --> 00:39:25,167
You...You practiced everything you were going to say, didn't you!

425
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:27,277
You won't give into even a word!

426
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,927
A person like you who has a kid should pay attention to raising the kid.

427
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,507
You'll have to sing everyday. How did you grow up that you have no ethics?!

428
00:39:35,877 --> 00:39:37,667
Why?! What?!

429
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:41,667
It's probably because I grew up without a father.

430
00:39:45,947 --> 00:39:48,717
Even a single mother has a lot of things she wants to do.

431
00:40:19,257 --> 00:40:20,957
What about the child?

432
00:40:21,657 --> 00:40:23,507
When you go to sing at the broadcasting station

433
00:40:23,617 --> 00:40:25,687
What are you going to do about the child?

434
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:29,587
Umm, we can bring him together, I guess

435
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:30,847
No, you can't!

436
00:40:31,077 --> 00:40:33,117
Do you know how many people I know at that station?!

437
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:35,737
Is there a reason for us to advertise our relationship?

438
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:38,017
Oh, he can go to kindergarten!

439
00:40:38,317 --> 00:40:40,647
Son, do you want to go to kindergarten?

440
00:40:42,737 --> 00:40:45,847
Hey, YOU. Who am I?

441
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:47,737
Grandpa! ^^

442
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:51,757
Ok look. Here is a grandfather.

443
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:56,017
This grandfather has three sons. so three brothers.

444
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:58,407
The second son is my father

445
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,417
This is the eldest son. The eldest son has two sons.

446
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:03,177
Then the surname should be the same.

447
00:41:04,017 --> 00:41:05,857
Ok ok. DAUGHTER. Not son. DAUGHTER.

448
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:09,557
Ok?! Then the surnames are differ-- AISH

449
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:12,137
Ok, I'll start over.

450
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:13,897
Grandfather has three sons

451
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:15,337
The second child is my father

452
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:16,777
Then this is the big daughter

453
00:41:16,897 --> 00:41:18,797
The big daughter has two sons

454
00:41:18,857 --> 00:41:20,107
How come everyone has sons...

455
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,597
WHAT ARE THEY SUPOSSED TO DO?!?!?!

456
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:24,557
What are they supposed to do about only having sons?! Am I the one delivering them?!

457
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:32,477
Who am I?

458
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,707
Uncle!

459
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:34,747
How am I your uncle?

460
00:41:34,857 --> 00:41:36,177
My dad's grandpa's second son's son

461
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:37,917
My uncle!

462
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:39,727
What about your parents?

463
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:44,187
Good job.

464
00:41:53,237 --> 00:41:55,237
- The principal will be here soon.
- oh yes, yes...

465
00:41:55,877 --> 00:41:59,907
He's my nephew! my newphew. On the mother's side. Huang gi dong.

466
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:08,197
HAHA JUST WANNA IRRITATE YOU! STICK MY BUTT AT YOU

467
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:18,807
Hey! Come here and sit quietly.

468
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:37,247
What? what are you looking at?

469
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,217
This isn't my son.

470
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,737
Do you like the kindergarten?

471
00:43:12,727 --> 00:43:14,707
Do you have a girl you like? What's her name?

472
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,857
Hurry up!

473
00:43:23,097 --> 00:43:23,927
Really?!

474
00:43:24,007 --> 00:43:26,037
So what'd the principal say?

475
00:43:32,427 --> 00:43:35,477
Why don't you go in and play? I'm watching tv here, gosh...

476
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:39,517
Are you curious? ehhhh, you wanna be in on this, huh?

477
00:43:39,537 --> 00:43:40,607
You're being very noisy.

478
00:43:40,707 --> 00:43:41,957
That's why he's whispering to my ear.

479
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,347
Look at that!

480
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:49,607
Who watches that?

481
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:51,247
I'm enjoying it.

482
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:54,847
At that time...

483
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,087
You laughed! You laughed, right?

484
00:44:05,157 --> 00:44:05,917
I didn't laugh, ok?

485
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:07,077
You're laughing right now!

486
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:08,407
No, I'm not!

487
00:44:25,577 --> 00:44:27,147
Aren't you gonna give me food?

488
00:45:02,977 --> 00:45:06,487
Since I married 3 years ago, last night was my first night at a club

489
00:45:06,717 --> 00:45:09,307
Why did I marry?

490
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:12,667
Those girls were dancing, and they're boobs were... wow...

491
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:15,137
Oh my god...

492
00:45:15,237 --> 00:45:16,737
What do you mean "oh my god"... I don't like big ones (breasts) anyway...

493
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:19,017
You report him, I'll be a witness.

494
00:45:19,127 --> 00:45:20,587
Yeah, maybe I really will!!!

495
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:25,077
Yeah, that girl Huang Jae In. She had just the right size!

496
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:31,057
She can sing really well, but doesn't she look "cheap"?

497
00:45:31,347 --> 00:45:35,097
I think she came from the countryside...her fashion sense is so tacky

498
00:45:35,117 --> 00:45:39,307
I don't know about cheap, but she definitely has a kid. Right?

499
00:45:39,457 --> 00:45:43,757
Yeah that's right. People from the countryside get into more trouble, see?

500
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:50,727
Yeah, her boobs stick out and are really nice, and then her "Ah~~~" is a killer

501
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:54,227
Wowww...in bed, those kind of girls are... "Ahh~~"--

502
00:45:56,527 --> 00:46:02,927
YAHHHH you perverted asshole!

503
00:46:03,077 --> 00:46:06,727
You call yourself a director/professional after describing her like that? You have a daughter!

504
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,857
In the future, if a person describes your daughter like you just did...

505
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:13,047
Report him, OK?!

506
00:46:13,087 --> 00:46:15,507
This kind of fellow deserves 10,000 punches

507
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:24,857
- Oh My God, What the-- ARGHH
- (What'd I say?!)

508
00:46:34,607 --> 00:46:38,777
Um I just wanted to say, I'm sure you're having a hard time because of my nephew...

509
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:43,717
But is there something in particular you like to eat?

510
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:49,287
You should pay more attention to your nephew

511
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:53,467
There's a girl that Gi Dong likes

512
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:55,527
But she said that Gi Dong is so tacky

513
00:46:55,627 --> 00:46:57,387
- So she won't play with him

514
00:46:57,937 --> 00:47:01,467
from what I see, he's a very cute child.

515
00:47:19,897 --> 00:47:22,987
He's my uncle, who's my dad's grandpa's second son's son!

516
00:47:23,527 --> 00:47:27,177
Yeah, he's my nephew...nephew...

517
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:33,407
Do you have something that looks noble and not cheap looking?

518
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,607
Why?

519
00:47:38,637 --> 00:47:39,927
Umm, well this...

520
00:47:40,537 --> 00:47:41,767
You don't like it?

521
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:44,927
Um, no, it's not that...but, this...

522
00:47:51,207 --> 00:47:52,667
Here, now we HAVE to buy this. Ok?

523
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:55,887
Please wrap this up and show me more clothes.

524
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:57,057
These are all expensive?

525
00:47:57,437 --> 00:47:59,297
Oh, umm, expensive...

526
00:48:07,827 --> 00:48:09,387
Thank you! Farewell!

527
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:22,447
Wowww, you guys look beautiful! So perfect!

528
00:48:22,537 --> 00:48:25,237
Since you guys have done this more than once...

529
00:48:25,817 --> 00:48:28,057
CAMERA!!!

530
00:48:29,337 --> 00:48:31,047
- Sang Min, get us something to drink!
- Yes!

531
00:48:42,257 --> 00:48:45,827
Oh my God!, are you ok?!

532
00:49:00,977 --> 00:49:02,767
Miss Kim Miyoung...Hey, did you call Huang Jae In?

533
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:05,007
She said she already arrived before

534
00:49:05,107 --> 00:49:07,007
Hey, if she comes, don't let her in

535
00:49:07,057 --> 00:49:08,237
What does she think she is? a star?

536
00:49:08,257 --> 00:49:10,097
Why does she want to be last?

537
00:49:12,697 --> 00:49:15,027
- She's here!
- (I'll greet her!)

538
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:17,217
Oh, you're a bit late! Just a bit!

539
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:22,927
Wow, you really changed!

540
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:29,117
Please, sit on that side!

541
00:49:31,337 --> 00:49:34,447
Excuse sir, please move to the other side for her.

542
00:50:07,627 --> 00:50:09,087
Jae In ah!

543
00:50:16,857 --> 00:50:18,637
You're Huang Jae In, right?

544
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,477
It's me. Sang Min. Sang Min Oppa (older brother)

545
00:50:22,127 --> 00:50:26,017
Got this! Mom, it's your turn.

546
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:32,657
Huh? Oh, Gi Dong, you won! Let's stop today. Hold on, ok?

547
00:50:32,787 --> 00:50:34,377
Ok

548
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:38,397
You're teaching him the wrong things.

549
00:50:44,687 --> 00:50:47,267
Nobody asks who I am?

550
00:50:47,357 --> 00:50:48,957
No

551
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:52,697
If someone asks, answer it like we practiced, ok?

552
00:50:52,757 --> 00:50:54,457
Ok

553
00:50:55,337 --> 00:50:57,367
Hmmm, some people should ask...

554
00:50:57,477 --> 00:50:59,007
You saw me on TV

555
00:50:59,127 --> 00:51:01,107
I'm really popular

556
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:04,197
You "pooped" (lost 3 cards)

557
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:13,137
Pi bang, ssang pan, and jung pang (awesome cards)
(he got murdered by the little kid)

558
00:51:18,967 --> 00:51:20,107
WHAT

559
00:51:20,187 --> 00:51:21,477
I need to pee

560
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:23,817
Do you want me to mix it? I'm mixing it!

561
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:25,367
Ok!

562
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:27,087
Aim well! And shake it 3 times.

563
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:28,647
Ok!

564
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:46,627
Here

565
00:51:46,657 --> 00:51:48,227
Pass! (he won't split the "deck")

566
00:52:23,817 --> 00:52:25,137
LOOK!

567
00:52:33,897 --> 00:52:38,657
You little kid! Where did You learn such bad things!
(go stop is a korean gambling game)

568
00:52:39,047 --> 00:52:41,037
I'm not playing!

569
00:52:49,157 --> 00:52:53,137
You used to like taking pictures. Now you're becoming a photographer!

570
00:52:53,297 --> 00:52:55,477
Are you still like that when you take pictures?

571
00:52:55,777 --> 00:52:57,587
Like what?

572
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:14,567
I kept that so I could show you when we met again

573
00:53:15,377 --> 00:53:17,297
It took a really long time...

574
00:53:19,557 --> 00:53:22,147
How come you can sing that well?

575
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,147
I think I watched that videos like 70,000 times

576
00:53:25,907 --> 00:53:28,117
Honestly, I cried a little when I watched

577
00:53:29,177 --> 00:53:31,777
Actually, the reason I participated in that...

578
00:53:33,207 --> 00:53:39,137
I thought maybe...you would see me if I was broadcasted

579
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:44,347
And then we'd possibly be able to meet again...that was part of the reason

580
00:53:47,587 --> 00:53:51,257
(korean mocking)

581
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:03,107
- Why didn't you tell me?

582
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:05,077
the thing Gi Dong plays well

583
00:54:11,137 --> 00:54:13,037
Did he play GoStop here?!

584
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,487
HEY! How could you play Gostop here--

585
00:54:21,587 --> 00:54:24,417
Gi Dong ah, show Uncle what you did before

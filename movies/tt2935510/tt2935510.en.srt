00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,627
I'm calm, steady.

3
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:36,966
I slept well. 8.2 hours.
No bad dreams.

4
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,838
I am ready to go.

5
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,843
Ready to do my job
to the best of my abilities.

6
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:51,211
<i>I am focused
only on the essential,</i>

7
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,949
<i>to the exclusion of all else.</i>

8
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,553
I will make
only pragmatic decisions.

9
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:01,789
<i>I will not allow myself
to be distracted.</i>

10
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,158
<i>I will not allow
my mind to linger</i>

11
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,895
<i>on that which is unimportant.</i>

12
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:21,008
I will not rely
on anyone or anything.

13
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,879
I will not be
vulnerable to mistakes.

14
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:29,652
Resting BPM, 47. Submit.

15

<i>Your psychological evaluation</i>

16
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:35,055

17

<i>As a reminder,</i>

18
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:37,725
<i>please perform any safety
and equipment checks...</i>

19
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:40,529
<i>I always wanted
to become an astronaut...</i>

20
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,133
<i>for the future
of mankind and all.</i>

21
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,539
<i>At least, that's what
I always told myself.</i>

22
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:59,115
<i>I see myself from the outside.</i>

23
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:02,785
<i>Smile, present a side.</i>

24
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:05,921
<i>It's a performance...</i>

25
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:08,891
<i>with my eye on the exit.</i>

26
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,095
<i>Always on the exit.</i>

27
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,400
<i>Just don't touch me.</i>

28
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:31,712
<i>Take care, Major. Be careful.</i>

29
00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:33,249
<i>Thanks for that.</i>

30
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:45,993
<i>Roy, Bravo post</i>

31

32
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:49,863
<i>appears to be malfunctioning.</i>

33
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:50,998
<i>We're gonna need you to take</i>

34
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,666
<i>a team down there
and check it out.</i>

35
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,369
<i>Run some diagnostics. Over.</i>

36
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:56,572
<i>Copy that.
Heading that way.</i>

37
00:05:06,082 --> 00:05:07,881
<i>Good morning
to our astronauts up there</i>

38
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:10,452
<i>on the International
Space Antenna.</i>

39
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:12,920
<i>Sure is a beautiful day.</i>

40
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,222
<i>Just perfect
to try and contact...</i>

41
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:17,893
<i>our distant neighbors
out there in the heavens.</i>

42
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,430
<i>At least
it's comfortable out here.</i>

43
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:24,064
<i>I got some scores here.</i>

44
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:28,635
<i>Let's see, it was Iowa State
over Kansas, 35 - 16.</i>

45
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:30,773
<i>Space I understand.</i>

46
00:05:36,745 --> 00:05:39,213
<i>Control, I have visual
on the arm. Over.</i>

47
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:40,948
<i>Affirmative, Major.
Proceed.</i>

48
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,151
<i>Copy that.
Moving to the unit now.</i>

49
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:57,664
<i>Control, I'm seeing
a power surge on C-post.</i>

50
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,799
<i>You getting that?</i>

51
00:05:58,801 --> 00:06:00,200
<i>Uh...
Roger that, Roy...</i>

52
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:01,835
<i>Control, we got a lot
of people up there. Over.</i>

53
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:04,004
<i>Control. Control,
I think we have some spikes...</i>

54
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:05,373
<i>Please just stand
by, we're working the issue.</i>

55
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,707
<i>Just stand by.</i>

56
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,411
<i>Control,
they're happening everywhere.</i>

57
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,661
<i>Command, cutting power.</i>

58
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:29,531
<i>Get off the tower now!</i>

59
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,436
<i>You've gotta bail out!</i>

60
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,049
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

61
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:04,934
<i>Control, McBride.</i>

62
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,301
<i>I'm in a spin.</i>

63
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:09,838
<i>Atmosphere's too thin
to stabilize.</i>

64
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:14,576
<i>I'm trying to keep
the tumble down,</i>

65
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,379
<i>so I don't black out.</i>

66
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:21,351
<i>Control, do you read?</i>

67
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:01,150
<i>"A self-destructive side."</i>

68
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,385
<i>That's what
she used to say to me.</i>

69
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:08,391
<i>I should feel something.</i>

70
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,994
<i>I survived.</i>

71
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:14,429
<i>I should feel something.</i>

72
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:16,096
<i>In what has become
known as "The Surge"...</i>

73
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,433
<i>a series of destructive
electrical storms</i>

74
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:20,635
<i>has wreaked havoc
across the globe...</i>

75
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:21,935
<i>and scientists are concerned</i>

76
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,037
<i>we've not seen
the last of them yet.</i>

77
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,206
<i>Their origin? Outer space.</i>

78
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,344
<i>The cause? Unknown so far...</i>

79
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:31,746
<i>This is a message
from SPACECOM.</i>

80
00:09:31,748 --> 00:09:33,481
<i>In light of
the recent catastrophe...</i>

81
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:35,282
<i>your attendance
is required for a debrief...</i>

82
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,685
<i>to be held in Building 91,
Vandersteen Base.</i>

83
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:40,423
<i>Please note, this meeting will
be classified "top secret."</i>

84
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,395
Roy, how are you? Thanks for coming in.
Appreciate it.

85
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:48,328
General.

86
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,230
This is Lieutenant
General Rivas, Director of

87
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:51,932
- U.S. SPACECOM Special Ops.
- Hi.

88
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:53,133
- Sir.
- Major.

89
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,435
Adjutant General
Vogel, head of Security.

90
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:55,770
- Major.
- Ma'am.

91
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:57,270
They flew
all the way in from Virginia

92
00:09:57,272 --> 00:09:59,272
just last night,
just to see you.

93
00:09:59,274 --> 00:10:00,340
Well, thank you.

94
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:03,076
Your, uh, profile
is certainly very impressive.

95
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:06,079
You've done exceptionally well
on all the assessment tests.

96
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:08,148
Basic combat,
space training.

97
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,085
Just exceptional
across the board.

98
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:11,552
The rumor is that

99
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:14,087
your pulse rate
has never gone above 80...

100
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:15,790
in any of the spacewalks,
skywalks,

101
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:16,858
and even on
this most recent fall.

102
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,393
Is that correct?

103
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:19,761
Well, so far, sir.

104
00:10:19,763 --> 00:10:21,396
That's very impressive.

105
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:24,197
According to this,
married once, no children?

106
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:25,999
Yes, sir.

107
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,235
It's dangerous business,
as we know.

108
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:30,339
Best not to
subject others to it.

109
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,774
Fair enough.

110
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:33,940
Well, we didn't
bring you in here

111
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:36,145
to talk about
your fall, Roy.

112
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,513
We have something...

113
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:43,285
of a highly classified nature
to show you.

114
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:47,524
Please have a seat, Major.

115
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,158
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,665
What you are
about to see are

117
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,702
spectrogram images of Neptune.

118
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:03,871
These are cosmic ray bursts.

119
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:07,040
That was taken
just 11 days ago.

120
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,176
It released
high-energy particles...

121
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:11,913
that caused
a catastrophic power surge

122
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:14,749
all over the world.

123
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:17,387
And that's what
almost killed you.

124
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:20,187
The rays grow stronger

125
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,592
as they radiate towards us
here on Earth.

126
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:31,668
Major, what can you tell us
about the Lima Project?

127
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:39,574
First manned expedition to
the outer solar system, sir.

128
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:44,645
Some 29 years ago,
as you know.

129
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,980
And the commander was...

130
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:49,251
He was my father, sir.

131
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:51,151
The ship disappeared

132
00:11:51,153 --> 00:11:53,788
approximately 16 years
into the mission.

133
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,423
No data was ever recovered.

134
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,760
Deep space missions
were halted after that.

135
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:00,695
Yes, that's him.

136
00:12:00,697 --> 00:12:04,266
Can you tell us how you
handled your father's absence?

137
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,537
Well...

138
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:12,840
My mother was
certainly distressed by it.

139
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:15,275
Uh, she was quite ill
at the time.

140
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:18,446
But he was,
uh, committed to his job...

141
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,750
and I'm sure it was very
difficult for him as well.

142
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,684
Roy...

143
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:28,090
we have something that might
come as quite a shock to you.

144
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:34,929
We believe your father
is still alive near Neptune.

145
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:36,497
Where exactly,
we do not know.

146
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:38,198
Now, we've sent out
numerous drones,

147
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,670
but obviously,
it's a vast area to cover.

148
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:50,011
My father's alive, sir?

149
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:52,279
We believe so.

150
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,782
Roy, The Surge
seems to be the result

151
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:57,585
of some kind
of anti-matter reaction.

152
00:12:57,587 --> 00:13:00,388
Now, the Lima Project was
powered by that material...

153
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,492
and your father
was in charge of it.

154
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:04,224
Now, we're talking about

155
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:08,029
a potentially unstoppable
chain reaction here.

156
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:10,230
The uncontrolled release
of anti-matter...

157
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:11,599
could ultimately threaten

158
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:15,135
the stability of
our entire solar system.

159
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:17,807
All life could be destroyed.

160
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,108
Major, we would
like you to send

161
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,078
a personal message on Mars
by secure laser...

162
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,816
to what we hope
is the Lima Project.

163
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:29,951
The text of your message

164
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,218
would be prepared in advance,
of course.

165
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,322
Mars, sir?
I'm going to Mars?

166
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:38,861
It is the last secure hub
we have.

167
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:42,863
Roy,
we need to find out

168
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,098
just what
we're up against here.

169
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,534
Our underground Mars base

170
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:50,404
was the only one
unaffected by The Surge.

171
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:52,238
And we believe
a personal plea,

172
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,710
from you to your father,
might elicit a response.

173
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:57,445
We can track that signal...

174
00:13:57,447 --> 00:14:01,048
locate him and figure out
a way to stop this.

175
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:06,787
What is happening out there is
a crisis of unknown magnitude.

176
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:10,190
Now, we're counting on you
to help us find him.

177
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:12,260
Are you with us?

178
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:17,999
- Yes, I am, sir.
- Good.

179
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,734
You deploy first
to the moon.

180
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:21,035
Our long-range rockets

181
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:22,403
are stationed there
on the Far Side.

182
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:24,405
Everything after that will be
on a need-to-know basis.

183
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:25,338
Yes, sir.

184
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,475
Given the magnitude
of the threat...

185
00:14:27,477 --> 00:14:31,412
a cover story is being
formulated to avoid all panic.

186
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:33,781
You'll be traveling
commercially to the moon

187
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:34,949
to keep a low profile.

188
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:37,551
Colonel Pruitt will be your
point person from here on.

189
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:40,823
Absolute top secrecy
must be maintained.

190
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,459
<i>"Are you with us?"</i>

191
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:47,229
<i>Like I have a choice.</i>

192
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:51,832
<i>My dad was a pioneer.</i>

193
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:55,270
<i>He sacrificed himself for the
search for intelligent life.</i>

194
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:58,574
<i>My dad was the program.</i>

195
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:03,176
<i>I was 16 when he left,
29 when he disappeared.</i>

196
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:06,580
<i>Archived
message, received 27 years...</i>

197
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:09,517
- <i>3 months, 2 days ago.</i>
- <i>And that's that.</i>

198
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,286
<i>Roy, this is
a message from your father.</i>

199
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:16,123
<i>I'm coming at you
from the Lima Project.</i>

200
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:20,293
<i>Just on our way past Jupiter
and ultimately on to Neptune.</i>

201
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,396
<i>I know you have seen</i>

202
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:25,298
<i>that we have excited
real and enormous interest...</i>

203
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,302
<i>around the world,
and we are grateful for it.</i>

204
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,606
<i>We're doing big things
up here, real big.</i>

205
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:35,943
<i>Namely, we're about to answer
the number one question...</i>

206
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:39,814
<i>when do we find all the
intelligent life out there?</i>

207
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:41,549
<i>And we know we will.</i>

208
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:43,651
<i>We're going to the edge
of the heliosphere...</i>

209
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:45,352
<i>where the sun's
magnetic field</i>

210
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:47,988
<i>won't affect
our instruments one bit.</i>

211
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,426
<i>We'll be able to examine any
star system for complex life.</i>

212
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:55,596
<i>Never been done before,
and we sure are optimistic.</i>

213
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:59,366
<i>I feel your energy back home,
and of course, I think of God.</i>

214
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:04,373
<i>I'm overwhelmed at seeing
and feeling His presence...</i>

215
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:06,907
<i>so close.</i>

216
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:08,511
<i>I love you, my son.</i>

217
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:15,785
Hello, Roy.

218
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,923
I'm here to go
on this trip with you.

219
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:23,557
Keep my eye on ya.

220
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:26,462
Colonel Pruitt,
good to meet you.

221
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:28,631
Actually...

222
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:32,233
we've met.

223
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:35,538
It was a long time ago.
I knew your dad.

224
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:38,405
We were close,
he and I.

225
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:42,378
We started out together,
went to Purdue together.

226
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,112
He was a brilliant man.

227
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,214
- I know.
- Yeah.

228
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,583
And I remember going
to the house and seeing you.

229
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:51,752
You were running around
everywhere.

230
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:54,855
You drove your
poor mother nuts, but...

231
00:16:54,857 --> 00:16:56,392
How do you feel?

232
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,295
Is this part
of my psych eval?

233
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:04,965
Uh...

234
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,700
No, not really, but yes.

235
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:09,804
I mean, you're going
to be monitored constantly...

236
00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:13,741
your mental state,
your emotional state.

237
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:17,778
You have a direct connection
with the subject.

238
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,517
Colonel, for what it's worth,
I think my father's dead.

239
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,055
Yeah, um...

240
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:34,295
I was a lunar astronaut
for SPACECOM for 31 years.

241
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:37,798
And I came to the
realization out there...

242
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,435
a voyage of exploration
can be used

243
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:44,972
for something
as simple as escape.

244
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:46,941
I'm telling you this, Roy,

245
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:51,312
because we have to
hold out the possibility...

246
00:17:51,314 --> 00:17:54,984
that your father
may be hiding from us.

247
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:01,657
Do you think
you're ready to go?

248
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:05,893
I'm ready.

249
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:06,963
All right.

250
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:28,115
<i>Your pre-launch quarantine</i>

251
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:30,284
<i>is almost complete.</i>

252
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:31,518
<i>You have shown no evidence</i>

253
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,753
<i>of bacterial
or viral infection...</i>

254
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:35,756
<i>So many times in my life,
I've screwed up.</i>

255
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:37,391
<i>Although
all efforts have been made...</i>

256
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:40,828
<i>I've talked,
when I should have listened.</i>

257
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,364
<i>I've been harsh,</i>

258
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:44,899
<i>when I should have
been tender.</i>

259
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,301
<i>In the event
of illness or accident...</i>

260
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:48,535
<i>please make certain</i>

261
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:50,504
<i>that you have listed
any family members...</i>

262
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,006
<i>spouse, or significant other</i>

263
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:54,341
<i>as your next of kin,
in your personal file.</i>

264
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,811
Volume down.

265
00:18:57,413 --> 00:19:00,881
Message.
Personal directory. Eve.

266
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:05,922
Hi, Eve, it's Roy.

267
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:08,589
Uh...

268
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:11,494
I'm away again,
no surprise there.

269
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:15,898
I just wanted to say...

270
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,778
<i>I made a promise
to always be truthful.</i>

271
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:31,045
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

272
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:34,450
Listen, I wanted to say...

273
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:42,058
I didn't want you to go.

274
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:46,729
Delete.

275
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:49,897
Cancel.

276
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:53,901
<i>Good morning.</i>

00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:55,936
<i>I've been trained

278

<i>SPACECOM requires you

280
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:02,778
<i>It seems to me
that's how I approach my life.</i>

281
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:07,550
Resting BPM is 56.

282
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:12,553
Didn't sleep much last night,
but it shouldn't be a problem.

283
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:14,757
I remain mission ready.

284
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:17,992
<i>You have been approved</i>

290

No.

Again.

292
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:36,543
- How's that?
- Okay.

293
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:38,614
- Okay, not too snug?
- Yeah, it feels all right.

294
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,682
Breathe.

- Hi, Captain.
- Watch the step.

300
00:20:55,731 --> 00:20:57,299
- Duck your head.
- Okay.

301
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:01,369

the grand telescope array...</i>

318
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:21,782
<i>near the Atlas crater.</i>

319
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:23,717
<i>It's the moon's
largest facility</i>

320
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,821
<i>for extraterrestrial research.</i>

321
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:28,856
Hot towel?

322
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:30,458
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you for flying with us.

323
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,594
We do appreciate it.

324
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:34,964
<i>Please prepare for landing.</i>

325
00:23:06,896 --> 00:23:09,730
<i>All the hopes we ever
had for space travel...</i>

326
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:13,568
<i>covered up by drink stands
and T-shirt vendors.</i>

327
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,972
<i>Just a recreation of what
we're running from on Earth.</i>

328
00:23:19,543 --> 00:23:21,744
<i>We are world-eaters.</i>

329
00:23:22,678 --> 00:23:25,480
<i>If my dad could
see this now...</i>

330
00:23:25,482 --> 00:23:28,182
<i>he'd tear it all down.</i>

331
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:40,160
Our rocket
is named <i>Cepheus.</i>

332
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:43,665
The crew will be
SPACECOM military personnel.

333
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:46,534
They're completely unaware
of our mission.

334
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:48,202
We have to
keep it that way.

335
00:23:48,204 --> 00:23:51,738
The launchpad is on the
other side of no man's land.

336
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,308
It's very dangerous...

337
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,043
so we'll have armed personnel

338
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:59,215
to protect us and escort us
to the Far Side.

339
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:05,786
Colonel, can I ask
what the last conversation

340
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:07,457
you had with my dad was?

341
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:11,693
It was not very pleasant.

342
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:15,064
We quarreled about
my leaving the program.

343
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,469
He accused me
of being a traitor.

344
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:24,271
And if you were
to find him...

345
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:26,175
then what?

346
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:30,110
Is this very difficult
for you, son?

347
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:31,981
This being about your father?

348
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:35,751
No.

349
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:38,852
No, my dad's a hero.

350
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,321
SPACECOM's trying
to impugn a man

351
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:43,658
who's given his entire life
to the program.

352
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,462
I think it's despicable.

353
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,365
Or desperate at best.

354
00:24:52,469 --> 00:24:54,736
<i>We are approaching Terminal R,</i>

355
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:56,136
<i>lunar rover hangar.</i>

356
00:24:56,138 --> 00:24:59,773
We've been having trouble
with pirates since September.

357
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:01,808
Some countries have been
giving them safe haven.

358
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,878
They'll take hostages
or go for our rovers.

359
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,114
It's like the Wild West
out there...

360
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:09,818
but we'll get you
to your spacecraft.

361
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:13,954
This your first time
in a war zone?

362
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:15,922
Three years over
the Arctic Circle.

363
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:17,224
All right.

364
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:19,627
And a heck of a lot
of Army-Navy games.

365
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:21,729
Well,
I guess there's not much

366
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:23,130
you haven't seen, right?

367
00:25:23,132 --> 00:25:25,098
Well, look,
it's almost a full moon.

368
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,334
A large stretch of the
Far Side's real black,

369
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:29,169
so let's suit up.

370
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:30,605
<i>Lunar Rovers, Group C,</i>

371
00:25:30,607 --> 00:25:31,838
<i>set for departure...</i>

372
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,743
<i>to the Far Side launch complex
through gate 12.</i>

373
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:38,247
<i>Please maintain
situational awareness.</i>

374
00:25:57,467 --> 00:26:00,000
<i>Rover 7, confirming settings.</i>

375
00:26:00,002 --> 00:26:02,405
<i>Bearing two-niner-oh.</i>

376
00:26:44,012 --> 00:26:45,480
<i>Roy?</i>

377
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:46,447
<i>Yes, Colonel.</i>

378
00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:51,151
<i>Look at it.
The big blue marble.</i>

379
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:54,089
<i>Never ceases to amaze me.</i>

380
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,945
<i>Lieutenant,
you clocking this?</i>

381
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:20,381
<i>Yeah, same here.</i>

382
00:27:20,383 --> 00:27:22,916
<i>I can't ID any
national markings. Over.</i>

383
00:27:22,918 --> 00:27:24,251
- <i>Lieutenant...</i>
- <i>At 7 o'clock...</i>

384
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:27,388
<i>Alpha,
what do we got here?</i>

385
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,156
<i>Alpha, we have
what looks like</i>

386
00:27:29,158 --> 00:27:32,192
<i>unidentified rovers
approaching our position.</i>

387
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,293
<i>Possible pirate activity,</i>

388
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:35,061
<i>and I got a couple
of VIPs with me.</i>

389
00:27:35,063 --> 00:27:36,597
<i>Roger,
moving to flank you.</i>

390
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:40,167
<i>Uh, Alpha, we may need
some ballistics help up here.</i>

391
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:41,436
<i>Potential hostile situation...</i>

392
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:45,172
<i>Here we go again,
fighting over resources.</i>

393
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,040
<i>We got two coming up
on our rear, 7 o'clock.</i>

394
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,341
<i>Appears to be pirates,</i>

395
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:49,811
<i>possibly looking
for valuables.</i>

396
00:27:49,813 --> 00:27:51,479
<i>We'll send
ballistic support ASAP.</i>

397
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:54,515
<i>What the hell
am I doing here?</i>

398
00:27:58,688 --> 00:27:59,787
<i>Shit!</i>

399
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:00,922
<i>Alpha,
we need backup ASAP!</i>

400
00:28:00,924 --> 00:28:02,757
<i>We're being ambushed!</i>

401
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,892
- <i>Mayday, mayday, mayday!</i>
- <i>Give me a weapon!</i>

402
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:06,295
<i>Just hold on!</i>

403
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:12,435
<i>LRV-3 down.</i>

404
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:15,638
<i>LRV-2 down.</i>

405
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,540
<i>Alpha,
we're gonna go off path</i>

406
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:20,643
<i>to reach the Far Side.</i>

407
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:25,780
<i>I have a puncture!</i>

408
00:28:25,782 --> 00:28:28,516
- <i>Roy!
- I have a puncture.</i>

409
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:35,957
<i>Roy, you all right?</i>

410
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,090
<i>I'm okay.</i>

411
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,428
<i>Alpha, repeat,
we need...</i>

412
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:41,598
<i>Lieutenant!
Oh, Lord!</i>

413
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:46,369
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

414
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,437
<i>Hey, break it up.</i>

415
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:52,072
<i>We are not clear.
I repeat, we are not clear.</i>

416
00:28:52,074 --> 00:28:54,976
<i>We have multiple
enemy craft in pursuit.</i>

417
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:57,145
<i>Roy!
They're trying to ram us!</i>

418
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:08,923
<i>Command,
Lieutenant is KIA.</i>

419
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:10,190
<i>We've lost our escort.</i>

420
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:12,160
<i>Request immediate support.
Over.</i>

421
00:30:32,976 --> 00:30:34,307
<i>Command,</i>

422
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:36,744
<i>the Lieutenant's body
can be recovered...</i>

423
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:39,147
<i>just outside Walther crater.</i>

424
00:30:39,983 --> 00:30:42,452
<i>Sorry for the loss.</i>

425
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:44,152
<i>Over.</i>

426
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:46,389
<i>Roger that, Major.</i>

427
00:30:47,523 --> 00:30:49,590
<i>Uh, Colonel Pruitt,
we're picking up</i>

428
00:30:49,592 --> 00:30:52,258
<i>an irregular heartbeat
through your system.</i>

429
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,463
<i>We suggest you get that
checked out immediately.</i>

430
00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:58,133
<i>He's supposed to be
my security blanket.</i>

431
00:30:58,635 --> 00:31:00,868
<i>I'm fine.</i>

432
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,336
<i>Why does he still do it?</i>

433
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:05,875
<i>Why can't he just let go?</i>

434
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:14,515
<i>My dad couldn't either.</i>

435
00:31:14,517 --> 00:31:16,517
<i>Major,
we've been expecting you.</i>

436
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,853
If you have any personal
business you need to tend to,

437
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:20,322
I suggest doing it now.

438
00:31:21,156 --> 00:31:23,357
Your rocket
will leave momentarily.

439
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,692
Stand down, Sergeant.

440
00:31:24,694 --> 00:31:25,695
Yes, sir.

441
00:31:26,963 --> 00:31:31,499
Roy, just let me sit down.

442
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:34,169
Colonel, what is it?

443
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:40,306
I'm not going to be able
to go with you to Mars.

444
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:43,579
But there are things
you need to know, Roy.

445
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:47,548
Every minute counts.

446
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,016
Cepheus <i>crew,</i>

447
00:31:49,018 --> 00:31:50,885
<i>prepare for pre-launch checks.</i>

448
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:55,591
SPACECOM communicated with me.

449
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:58,260
It is classified.

450
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:00,963
Take it.

451
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:10,071
It will put you
at great risk.

452
00:32:10,073 --> 00:32:13,409
They do not trust you
on SPACECOM.

453
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,811
But it is crucial...

454
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:19,312
Sergeant!

455
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:21,449
<i>Commencing pre-launch checks.</i>

456
00:32:21,451 --> 00:32:24,520
You have to go, Roy. Go.

457
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:26,823
Go!

458
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,303
<i>Captain, Major McBride,
com check.</i>

459
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:44,472
<i>Loud and clear, sir.</i>

460
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:46,107
<i>Welcome aboard the</i> Cepheus.

461
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:48,576
<i>I'll be hitching a ride
with you if that's all right.</i>

462
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:50,177
<i>Yes,
we were alerted, sir.</i>

463
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,480
<i>On our way to Mars,
the very last stop.</i>

464
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:54,415
<i>We had two joining us?</i>

465
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:56,751
<i>It'll just be one,
I'm afraid.</i>

466
00:32:56,753 --> 00:33:00,621
<i>Well, we still like you,
Major... McBride!</i>

467
00:33:00,623 --> 00:33:02,356
<i>I think we might
just have ourselves</i>

468
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:04,592
<i>the son of a legend
onboard with us, team.</i>

469
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:06,961
<i>Roy, son of Clifford McBride.</i>

470
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:08,294
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

471
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:10,898
<i>How 'bout that?
Best in the galaxy.</i>

472
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,899
<i>Welcome aboard, sir.</i>

473
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,437
<i>They are scientists
and technicians...</i>

478

481
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:38,225

548
00:37:39,503 --> 00:37:40,968
We're slowing down.

549

Yes, sir.

550
00:37:41,904 --> 00:37:44,938
Got a mayday
from another craft, sir.

551
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,240
Captain,
this is a classified mission,

552
00:37:46,242 --> 00:37:47,141
we cannot stop.

553
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:50,310
Our destination is Mars.
Ersa Station.

554
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:51,513
Major,
this is a mayday.

555
00:37:51,515 --> 00:37:52,913
Stopping is protocol.

556
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:54,848
Any supply craft
can answer that call.

557
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,884
The mission
is the priority, Captain.

558
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:58,719
Do you not hear
what I'm saying?

559
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:03,358
Major, with respect, as I say,
we are obligated to stop.

560
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,892
As you're merely a passenger,

561
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:07,594
I'm not sure
I comprehend your position.

562
00:38:07,596 --> 00:38:09,596
'Course, you are
well within your rights

to take command
of this craft...

564
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,203
but if so, you will have to
reveal your objectives.

565
00:38:18,408 --> 00:38:20,274
Attend to the mayday.

566
00:38:20,276 --> 00:38:22,843

Do you read?

573
00:38:38,462 --> 00:38:40,863
The distress call
is fairly recent.

574
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:43,999
Maybe they were hit
by The Surge.

575
00:38:46,168 --> 00:38:49,336
Command, possible forced entry
to the <i>Vesta</i> required.

Either
First Lieutenant Stanford

577
00:38:50,873 --> 00:38:52,039
or I will take
a little spacewalk...

578
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,640
and make our way
to the craft, over.

579
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:54,844
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

580

Donald, what are you thinking?

581
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:00,116
Wanna go out there?

582
00:39:01,384 --> 00:39:03,986
Uh, yeah.
Doesn't matter to me.

583
00:39:05,555 --> 00:39:07,154
<i>He's scared.</i>

584
00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:08,021
Yeah, I know,

585
00:39:08,023 --> 00:39:10,124
my suit smells
like a locker room, too.

586
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:12,159
Oh, hell, I could use
a good stretch anyway.

<i>how the incident itself
affected you.</i>

657
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:42,110
The attack...

658
00:46:43,947 --> 00:46:46,482
it was full of rage.

659
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:54,289
I understand that rage.

660
00:46:57,594 --> 00:47:00,496
I've seen that rage
in my father...

661
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:03,733
and I've seen
that rage in me.

662
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,173
Because I'm angry...

663
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:14,877
that he took off.

664
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,214
He left us.

665
00:47:22,652 --> 00:47:24,821
You know...

666
00:47:25,555 --> 00:47:27,021
but when I look
at that anger,

667
00:47:27,023 --> 00:47:30,360
if I push it aside
and just put it away...

668
00:47:31,995 --> 00:47:35,529
all I see is hurt.

669
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:39,702
I just see pain.

670
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:42,570
I think it keeps me
walled off...

671
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:45,673
walled off
from relationships...

672
00:47:45,675 --> 00:47:47,642
and opening myself up and,

673
00:47:47,644 --> 00:47:49,846

really caring for someone.

674
00:47:52,982 --> 00:47:56,550
And I don't know
how to get past that.

675
00:47:56,552 --> 00:47:58,621
I don't know how
to get around that.

676
00:48:00,288 --> 00:48:02,659
And it worries me.

677
00:48:08,163 --> 00:48:10,265
And I don't wanna be that guy.

678
00:48:12,702 --> 00:48:14,570

we'll try again next cycle.</i>

792
00:55:55,231 --> 00:55:57,032
<i>They're using me.</i>

793
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:02,405
<i>Goddamn them.</i>

794
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:09,879
<i>I don't know
if I hope to find him...</i>

795
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:15,383
<i>or finally be free of him.</i>

796
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:29,798
<i>Dad...</i>

797
00:56:58,994 --> 00:57:01,096
Dad, I'd like
to see you again.

798
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:13,173
I recall how we used to watch

799
00:57:13,175 --> 00:57:14,609
black and white
movies together...

800
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,946
and musicals
were your favorite.

801
00:57:18,548 --> 00:57:20,849
I remember you tutoring me
in math.

802
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,921
You instilled in me
a strong work ethic.

803
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:31,994
"Work hard, play later,"
as you said.

804
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:38,765
You should know
I've chosen a career

805
00:57:38,767 --> 00:57:41,168
that you would approve of.

806
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:44,840
I've dedicated my life
to the exploration of space.

807
00:57:46,342 --> 00:57:47,810
And I thank you for that.

808
00:57:53,048 --> 00:57:55,050
So, I hope we can reconnect.

809
00:58:01,924 --> 00:58:03,759
Your loving son, Roy.

810
00:58:10,899 --> 00:58:12,500
<i>Transmission sent,</i>

811
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:14,136
<i>awaiting response.</i>

812
00:59:08,123 --> 00:59:11,058
Thank you so much, Major,
for all your help.

813
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,794
We'll be returning you
to the Earth

814
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:14,227
in short order.
Thank you.

815
00:59:14,229 --> 00:59:17,699
Excuse me. Did you get a
response from my father?

816
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:19,933
Major,
your personal connection

817
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,201
has made you unsuited...

818
00:59:21,203 --> 00:59:23,205
for continued service
on this mission.

819
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,746
He answered me,
didn't he?

820
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:33,980
Major, we will let you know
any details

821
00:59:33,982 --> 00:59:35,550
as soon as possible.

822
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:37,518
<i>Roy.</i>

823
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,820
<i>Your pulse is very fast.</i>

824
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:40,488
I know!

825
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,889
There's also some issues
with your biorhythms.

826
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:44,157
Those will need
to be addressed

827
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:46,694
before you can
safely return to Earth.

828
00:59:46,696 --> 00:59:47,829
<i>Would you please
follow that man</i>

829
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:50,132

830
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:56,205
Major.

831
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:00,242

832
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:03,879

833

<i>McBride, Roy R.

834
01:00:20,195 --> 01:00:22,399
<i>for your

835
01:00:24,434 --> 01:00:25,633
Yes.

836
01:00:25,635 --> 01:00:26,701
<i>How are you feeling</i>

837
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:28,068
<i>in your current state?</i>

838
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,704
Good, thank you.

839
01:00:29,706 --> 01:00:31,608
I will be returning
to Earth soon.

840
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:36,943
I'm content
to go home, and...

841
01:00:36,945 --> 01:00:38,011
<i>You have failed</i>

<i>You will be returned

844
01:00:41,684 --> 01:00:43,118
<i>until you are deemed...</i>

845
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:51,526

<i>Provide

01:00:55,498 --> 01:00:56,431

<i>Your priority

<i>if this restriction
is an error.</i>

853
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,101
You're going back
to Earth now?

854
01:01:36,004 --> 01:01:37,474
Can I help you?

855
01:01:40,677 --> 01:01:42,976
I've only been there once.

856
01:01:42,978 --> 01:01:44,978
As a child.

857
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,616
I was born here.

858
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:51,320
But I remember it so well.

859
01:01:52,822 --> 01:01:56,258
It was... beautiful.

860
01:01:59,362 --> 01:02:05,031
Ma'am, I'd really appreciate
my privacy right now.

861
01:02:05,033 --> 01:02:08,270
You're here because of
the cosmic rays, aren't you?

862
01:02:10,172 --> 01:02:11,674
That's classified.

863
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:18,111
The craft you came in,
the <i>Cepheus...</i>

864
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:22,150
they want me to requisition
it for deep space...

865
01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:25,786
with nuclear munitions
onboard.

866
01:02:25,788 --> 01:02:27,089
Did you know that?

867
01:02:29,392 --> 01:02:31,694
It's for a search
and destroy mission.

868
01:02:34,697 --> 01:02:39,500
I am responsible for more
than 1,100 people here.

869
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:41,169
On this base.

870
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:45,171
Now, I need to know.

871
01:02:45,173 --> 01:02:47,309
Are we gonna die?

872
01:02:49,512 --> 01:02:51,648
I don't know
what happens now.

873
01:02:55,618 --> 01:02:57,286
I know who you are.

874
01:02:59,254 --> 01:03:01,691
You are
Clifford McBride's son.

875
01:03:03,225 --> 01:03:04,394
Yes.

876
01:03:07,162 --> 01:03:10,165
Well, then we're both victims
of the Lima Project.

877
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:16,003
My parents left
for that expedition.

878
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:19,475
You and I share
a great loss, Roy.

879
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:23,580
Please, just tell me.

880
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:29,719
The <i>Cepheus</i> leaves
in five hours.

881
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,225
<i>You were right.</i>

882
01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:42,230
<i>The Surge is coming
from the Lima Project.</i>

883
01:03:43,165 --> 01:03:46,502
Ultimate catastrophe
is very possible.

884
01:03:48,504 --> 01:03:52,307
SPACECOM has determined
that I am unfit to carry on.

885
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:54,744
That's all I know.

886
01:03:59,515 --> 01:04:02,117
I believe
your father is alive.

887
01:04:03,353 --> 01:04:05,653
They never told you what
happened to him out there,

888
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:07,122
did they?

889
01:04:33,148 --> 01:04:34,347

<i>some of our people...</i>

<i>have been unable to handle
the psychological distress...</i>

900
01:05:16,492 --> 01:05:20,728
<i>of being so far away
from home.</i>

901
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:23,364
<i>They desired
to return to Earth,</i>

902
01:05:23,366 --> 01:05:25,533
<i>and I could not permit that.</i>

903
01:05:25,535 --> 01:05:27,968
<i>And I have to report
the reality</i>

904
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:29,437
<i>that they mutinied...</i>

905
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:33,874
<i>committed acts of sabotage

906

<i>I was forced to react

<i>of our station's

909
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:44,051
<i>and without doubt,</i>

910
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:46,723
<i>I did punish the innocent
along with the guilty.</i>

911
01:05:49,092 --> 01:05:51,726
<i>We will not turn back.</i>

912
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:54,795
<i>We will venture further
into space.</i>

913
01:05:54,797 --> 01:05:59,667
<i>We will find
alien intelligence.</i>

914
01:05:59,669 --> 01:06:03,506
<i>I am forever driven
on this quest.</i>

915
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:15,349
SPACECOM
would never allow

916
01:06:15,351 --> 01:06:17,620
their image to be shattered...

917
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:22,925
so they made him a hero
to protect themselves.

918
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:32,769
Your father
murdered my parents.

919
01:06:35,037 --> 01:06:37,840
That monster
threatens us all.

920
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:43,479
And now it's your burden.

921
01:06:57,493 --> 01:06:59,462
Can you get me
on that ship?

922
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:05,268
I can get you
to the rocket.

923
01:07:06,803 --> 01:07:10,039
After that,
you're on your own.

924
01:07:11,474 --> 01:07:13,341
I will deal with him.

925
01:07:14,977 --> 01:07:17,613
I will deal
with my father.

926

931
01:07:59,055 --> 01:08:00,356

932
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:03,860
I don't care anymore.

933
01:08:04,794 --> 01:08:07,997
I need to get back now,
do what I can.

934
01:08:09,198 --> 01:08:10,700
Good luck.

935

01:29:17,434 --> 01:29:18,968
Roy?

1125
01:29:20,803 --> 01:29:23,005
Roy, is that you?

1126
01:29:25,941 --> 01:29:29,678
I have cataracts,
I don't see very well.

1127
01:29:41,257 --> 01:29:42,791
Hi, Dad.

1128
01:29:44,994 --> 01:29:46,328
You alone?

1129
01:29:47,263 --> 01:29:49,564
Oh, yeah.

1130
01:29:49,566 --> 01:29:52,699
Captain always goes down
with the ship.

1131
01:29:54,069 --> 01:29:57,139
I've been here
quite a while alone.

1132
01:29:58,174 --> 01:30:01,411
I'm trying to stop
this goddamn surge.

1133
01:30:04,246 --> 01:30:05,814
What happened?

1134
01:30:07,183 --> 01:30:12,019
My last loyal few
tried to escape.

1135
01:30:12,021 --> 01:30:14,391
And they started all this.

1136
01:30:16,859 --> 01:30:19,927
They caused a meltdown
out there, Roy.

1137
01:30:19,929 --> 01:30:24,233
We fought, and our struggle
caused catastrophe.

1138
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,401
It's why I'm here.

1139
01:30:26,403 --> 01:30:28,902
I'm gonna stop it.

1140
01:30:28,904 --> 01:30:32,072
Get the two of us
back home, maybe.

1141
01:30:32,074 --> 01:30:33,376
Home?

1142
01:30:34,176 --> 01:30:35,778
Yep.

1143
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:39,482
This is home.

1144
01:30:40,883 --> 01:30:44,253
This is a one-way voyage,
my son.

1145
01:30:45,054 --> 01:30:47,790
You're talking about Earth?

1146
01:30:49,191 --> 01:30:50,891
There was never anything
for me there.

1147
01:30:50,893 --> 01:30:53,327
I never cared about you,
or your mother...

1148
01:30:53,329 --> 01:30:56,899
or any of your small ideas.

1149
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,434
For 30 years...

1150
01:30:59,436 --> 01:31:02,035
I've been breathing this air,
eating this food...

1151
01:31:02,037 --> 01:31:05,074
enduring these hardships...

1152
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:09,512
and I never once thought
about home.

1153
01:31:13,349 --> 01:31:14,883
I know, Dad.

1154
01:31:29,331 --> 01:31:32,500
I knew this would
widow your mother...

1155
01:31:32,502 --> 01:31:34,803
and orphan you...

1156
01:31:37,607 --> 01:31:40,175
but I found my destiny.

1157
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,486
So, I abandoned my son.

1158
01:31:54,357 --> 01:31:56,393
I still love you, Dad.

1159
01:32:05,834 --> 01:32:08,337
I'm taking you back.

1160
01:32:09,472 --> 01:32:12,074
Hmm... I have work to do.

1161
01:32:14,711 --> 01:32:17,946
I have infinite work to do.

1162
01:32:18,947 --> 01:32:21,551
I must find intelligent life.

1163
01:32:24,219 --> 01:32:26,088
It's time to go.

1164
01:32:27,956 --> 01:32:30,393
We don't have much time.

1165
01:32:40,269 --> 01:32:41,604
Come on.

1166
01:33:22,545 --> 01:33:25,912
I admire your courage
for coming alone, Roy...

1167
01:33:25,914 --> 01:33:27,981
traveling all this way...

1168
01:33:27,983 --> 01:33:30,285
following me here.

1169
01:33:32,589 --> 01:33:35,492
Makes me wonder what we could
have accomplished together.

1170
01:33:38,428 --> 01:33:39,694
But I guess...

1171
01:33:39,696 --> 01:33:42,730
the fates have deprived me

1172
01:33:42,732 --> 01:33:44,900
of the partner
I should have had.

1173
01:33:47,903 --> 01:33:50,440
If we'd had more people
like you...

1174
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:53,140
we could have pressed on,

1175
01:33:53,142 --> 01:33:55,043
could've found
what we're looking for.

1176
01:33:58,147 --> 01:34:01,248
My crew examined
all the data...

1177
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:04,752
discovered no other life
out there.

1178
01:34:04,754 --> 01:34:06,623
No other consciousness.

1179
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:09,359
They quit.

1180
01:34:15,732 --> 01:34:17,266
Sometimes...

1181
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:23,270
the human will must overcome
the impossible.

1182
01:34:23,272 --> 01:34:27,109
You and I have to
continue on, Roy. Together.

1183
01:34:30,279 --> 01:34:34,149
To find what science claims
does not exist.

1184
01:34:36,051 --> 01:34:38,555
You and I, together, Roy.

1185
01:34:42,725 --> 01:34:46,094
Because the Lima Project
has told us...

1186
01:34:47,162 --> 01:34:50,700
that we're all alone
in the knowable universe.

1187
01:34:52,936 --> 01:34:54,637
I can't fail.

1188
01:34:57,105 --> 01:34:59,542
You can't let me fail, Roy.

1189
01:35:10,353 --> 01:35:11,953
Dad...

1190
01:35:11,955 --> 01:35:14,223
you haven't.

1191
01:35:14,891 --> 01:35:17,159
Now, we know...

1192
01:35:19,529 --> 01:35:22,164
we're all we've got.

1193
01:36:09,211 --> 01:36:12,649
<i>Armed.
T-minus three hours.</i>

1194
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,682
<i>Dad! Stop!</i>

1195
01:38:10,867 --> 01:38:12,200
<i>Roy!</i>

1196
01:38:25,247 --> 01:38:26,549
<i>Let me go.</i>

1197
01:38:44,634 --> 01:38:46,969
<i>Let me go, Roy.</i>

1198
01:39:04,053 --> 01:39:06,721
<i>Roy, let me go.</i>

1199
01:39:06,723 --> 01:39:08,357
<i>Let me go, Roy.</i>

1200
01:39:09,224 --> 01:39:10,493
<i>Dad!</i>

1201
01:39:20,335 --> 01:39:22,438
<i>Let me go, Roy.</i>

1202
01:39:23,906 --> 01:39:25,441
<i>Unhook me.</i>

1203
01:39:26,042 --> 01:39:27,810
<i>Unhook me, son.</i>

1204
01:40:51,761 --> 01:40:53,429
<i>Why go on?</i>

1205
01:40:57,433 --> 01:40:59,569
<i>Why keep trying?</i>

1206
01:44:11,827 --> 01:44:13,996
<i>You're gathering
my work, I see.</i>

1207
01:44:20,703 --> 01:44:23,172
<i>Data download initiated.</i>

1208
01:44:25,074 --> 01:44:28,010
We're a dying breed, Roy.

1209
01:44:41,557 --> 01:44:43,624
<i>He captured
strange and distant worlds</i>

1210
01:44:43,626 --> 01:44:46,228
<i>in greater detail
than ever before.</i>

1211
01:44:48,998 --> 01:44:53,133
<i>They were beautiful,
magnificent...</i>

1212
01:44:53,135 --> 01:44:55,871
<i>full of awe and wonder.</i>

1213
01:44:57,239 --> 01:44:59,975
<i>But beneath
their sublime surfaces...</i>

1214
01:45:01,077 --> 01:45:03,243
<i>there was nothing.</i>

1215
01:45:03,245 --> 01:45:06,080
<i>No love or hate.</i>

1216
01:45:06,082 --> 01:45:09,583
<i>No light or dark.</i>

1217
01:45:09,585 --> 01:45:13,220
<i>He could only see
what was not there...</i>

1218
01:45:13,222 --> 01:45:16,025
<i>and missed what was
right in front of him.</i>

1219
01:46:43,846 --> 01:46:46,747
<i>Command,
this is Major Roy McBride.</i>

1220
01:46:46,749 --> 01:46:49,016
<i>I made it
to the Lima Project.</i>

1221
01:46:49,018 --> 01:46:50,385
<i>I am destroying
the structure...</i>

1222
01:46:50,387 --> 01:46:54,489
to prevent any further surges
from reaching Earth...

1223
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:57,360
using the nuclear munitions
onboard.

1224
01:46:57,893 --> 01:46:59,960
I will attempt to return

1225
01:46:59,962 --> 01:47:02,831
using the explosion
as my primary propellant.

1226
01:47:03,933 --> 01:47:06,266
In the case
I do not survive,

1227
01:47:06,268 --> 01:47:09,336
I've retrieved significant
data from the Lima.

1228
01:47:09,338 --> 01:47:12,375
And all efforts should be made
to retrieve my craft.

1229
01:47:14,977 --> 01:47:16,910
<i>Trajectory, Earth.</i>

1230
01:47:16,912 --> 01:47:20,483
<i>2.714 billion miles.</i>

1231
01:47:27,856 --> 01:47:31,727
I am looking forward to
the day my solitude ends.

1232
01:47:33,796 --> 01:47:35,498
And I'm home.

1233
01:47:38,568 --> 01:47:44,106
<i>Detonation
in T-minus 20 seconds.</i>

1234
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:32,946
<i>The aboard advisory system.</i>

1235
01:49:32,948 --> 01:49:34,147
<i>Affirmative,
we're ready.</i>

1236
01:49:34,149 --> 01:49:35,817
<i>USP flight system
is operational.</i>

1237
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:36,950
<i>Thank you.</i>

1238
01:49:36,952 --> 01:49:38,720
<i>K-R-5 on the 4-2.</i>

1239
01:49:38,722 --> 01:49:39,853
<i>Good copy, flight.</i>

1240
01:49:39,855 --> 01:49:41,458
<i>We're ready to go.</i>

1241
01:50:28,137 --> 01:50:29,570
<i>Coming in, clean.</i>

1242
01:50:29,572 --> 01:50:31,441
<i>Copy that. Thanks.</i>

1243
01:50:32,341 --> 01:50:35,275
<i>One ready to go.
Data is good.</i>

1244
01:50:35,277 --> 01:50:37,447
<i>We have all good. All good.</i>

1245
01:51:15,485 --> 01:51:17,252
You're all right, Major.

1246
01:51:36,673 --> 01:51:40,510
<i>I'm steady, calm.</i>

1247
01:51:41,310 --> 01:51:44,313
I slept well. No bad dreams.

1248
01:51:46,716 --> 01:51:50,085
I am active and engaged.

1249
01:51:53,690 --> 01:51:55,088
<i>I'm aware of my surroundings</i>

1250
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:57,627
<i>and those
in my immediate sphere.</i>

1251
01:51:59,395 --> 01:52:00,996
I'm attentive.

1252
01:52:05,033 --> 01:52:06,934
<i>I'm focused
on the essential...</i>

1253
01:52:06,936 --> 01:52:09,405
<i>to the exclusion
of all else.</i>

1254
01:52:26,021 --> 01:52:29,089
I'm unsure of the future...

1255
01:52:29,091 --> 01:52:30,693
but I'm not concerned.

1256
01:52:36,131 --> 01:52:39,234
I will rely
on those closest to me.

1257
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:46,108
<i>And I will share
their burdens...</i>

1258
01:52:54,283 --> 01:52:56,218
as they share mine.

1259
01:53:01,491 --> 01:53:02,759
I will live...

1260
01:53:04,394 --> 01:53:06,228
and love.

1261
01:53:12,969 --> 01:53:14,370
Submit.

1262
01:53:18,809 --> 01:53:23,809

2
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,216
Come on, Buddy.

3
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,346
Be careful.

4
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,437
Watch out for that glass.

5
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,265
Mm.

6
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:43,756
What the hell is
wrong with people?

7
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,312
Huh, Buddy?

8
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,009
Doesn't it seem
like everybody is

9
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:49,577
getting stupider and stupider?

10
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:52,406
Why did they have to
bebreaking somebody's window?

11
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,059
Huh, Buddy?

12
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,148
Are you listening to me?

13
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,063
I know what you're
thinking about.

14
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:01,197
You just want to eat.

15
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:04,548
Let's go now. 'Cause
I got to get to work.

16
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:07,159
You hold onto that ball.

17
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,963
What do you think
you'regoing to have for breakfast

18
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,816
this morning, huh?

19
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:13,209
Bacon and eggs?

20
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,384
Ha, ha.

21
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,515
You wish.

22
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:24,829
What are you, a cat or a rabbit?

23
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,658
Kitty cat.

24
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:31,401
You're a rabbit,
afuzzy-headed little rabbit.

25
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:34,143
Mm.

26
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,492
You've got a hard-on.

27
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:36,363
No, I don't.

28
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:37,755
You do too.

29
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:40,889
Mary, don't you think
I'dknow it if I had a hard-on?

30
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,934
Then what's this?

31
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:45,763
That's a carrot I keep
tofeed the little rabbit with.

32
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:49,550
Come on, Joe.

33
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,073
Stop.

34
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:52,030
I don't have time.

35
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:53,423
We'll do it tonight, OK?

36
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,947
OK, if that's what
you want, I'll stop.

37
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:00,430
Oh, all right.

38
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,301
Quick.

39
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:03,825
Get a rubber, carrot boy.

40
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,696
Well, let's just do it without.

41
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,002
No!

42
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,153
Come on, I don't
want to get pregnant.

43
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:09,439
- All right.
- No.

44
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,721
All right, all right. Calm down.

45
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:11,485
I get it.

46
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:12,703
Just a second.

47
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,575
Help!

48
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:16,403
Help!

49
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,971
Somebody help me, please!

50
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:23,540
Help!

51
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:24,498
Help!

52
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:26,891
That man stole my dog!

53
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:28,153
Joe, call the police!

54
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,111
What's the matter?

55
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,417
Oh, my god!

56
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:31,568
Someone just stole
this woman's dog!

57
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:32,332
Call the police!

58
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:33,637
Help me!

59
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,247
Help!

60
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:36,248
Shit! WOMAN: Stop!

61
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:37,119
Oh, god.

62
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:38,381
I see him.

63
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:39,643
You stole my dog!

64
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:41,210
Buddy! - Come on, now.

65
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,167
Buddy!

66
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,343
I see you, you prick!

67
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:44,256
Stop, please!

68
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,954
We're calling the police, ma'am.

69
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:48,870
He stole my dog!

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,827
Buddy!

71
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,958
Buddy!

72
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:40,661
Hey.

73
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,053
Hey, where are you going?

74
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,185
Sorry, babe.

75
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,622
I've got to split.

76
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,073
Oh, don't you
want some breakfast?

77
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,972
No.

78
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:51,062
No time for that.

79
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,934
What's with this lock?

80
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:54,370
You turn it to the left.

81
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,938
To the left.

82
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,188
Am I going to see you again?

83
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,027
Oh, sure.

84
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:00,855
Of course, babe.

85
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:02,857
I'll give you a call sometime.

86
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,336
Take it easy.

87
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,338
Do you like rollerblading?

88
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:14,216
Oh, shit.

89
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:18,307
Joe, is this
blouse too revealing?

90
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,700
Look at this.

91
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,267
There's Joe Schmo,
talented new actor.

92
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,028
And here's Miss Quim,
talented new actress.

93
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:25,096
Joe.

94
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,683
He's standing on the
street in an overcoat.

95
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,578
And she's lying on the
floor in her underwear

96
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:29,773
with her boobs hanging out.

97
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:30,841
So?

98
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:32,060
What do you mean, so?

99
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,889
Here it is,
25 yearsafter women's liberation.

100
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,432
And women are still
being reduced to selling

101
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,109
themselves as sex objects.

102
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,347
Maybe she doesn't feel reduced.

103
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:43,463
Maybe she feels proud
of her sexuality.

104
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:45,203
Well, maybe he's
proud of his sexuality.

105
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:46,814
Why isn't he crawling
across the floor

106
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,380
with his balls hanging out?

107
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,426
And what do boobs have
to do with acting?

108
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,515
Nothing.

109
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,343
I'm going to write
a book about this.

110
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,345
You're not working today?

111
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,607
Yes, I'm working.

112
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:58,976
I'm working a lunch,
and then I have

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,760
that audition with
thecasting director at 3:00.

114
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:01,524
Right.

115
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:02,656
Oh, good luck, hon.

116
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:03,874
Thank you.

117
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:06,224
Um, listen,
I stillneed a check for the rent.

118
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:08,226
What, again?

119
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:09,097
Yeah, it kind of works that way.

120
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:12,056
You know, once a month?

121
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:14,798
Oh, remember we have
dinnerwith Raina and Alex tonight.

122
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:16,036
And I think they're
bringing the baby.

123
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,149
All right, I'll meet
you after the audition.

124
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,368
Good luck, honey.

125
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,499
Bye.

126
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:24,721
There you are, Mr. Bob.

127
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:25,722
Clean and pressed.

128
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,376
Very nice.

129
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,527
It's is a piece of shit, Chang.

130
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,291
Oh, no.

131
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,641
It's a very nice tuxedo.

132
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,295
It's a piece of shit.

133
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,601
And I'll tell you something.

134
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,733
The next time I come inhere,
I'll give it to you.

135
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:37,604
Oh, no.

136
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:40,041
Mr. Bob, keep your tuxedo.

137
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,259
No, it's yours.

138
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,524
A little souvenir
from me to you.

139
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:46,014
You know what that
means, souvenir?

140
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:47,352
Yes.

141
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:50,138
I think it means you
are full of shit.

142
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:52,523
Keep going to night school.

143
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,060
Looking good today, sugar tits.

144
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,289
Hello, Miss Taylor?

145
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,769
It's Dee Dee, isn't it?

146
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,205
It's really great to meet you.

147
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,033
Thank you for seeing me.

148
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,600
But how could you miss me?

149
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,428
I'm standing right
in front of you.

150
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,104
What I'm going to do for
you today, Miss Taylor,

151
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:25,932
is one of Hap's speechesfrom
Arthur Miller's "Death

152
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:26,956
of a Salesman."

153
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:38,316
You know, Biff,
sometimes Iwant to just rip my clothes off

154
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:39,927
in the middle of
that store and outbox

155
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:42,712
that god damn
merchandise manager.

156
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:45,149
I mean, I can outbox,
outrun, and outlift

157
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,238
anybody in that store.

158
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:49,980
And I have to take ordersfrom those common,
petty sons

159
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:53,680
of bitches till I
can't stand it anymore.

160
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,728
You see, everybody
around me is so false.

161
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,179
I'm constantly
lowering my ideals.

162
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:04,778
Hello, Miss Taylor?

163
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:07,519
It's Dee Dee, isn't it?

164
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,749
Where are the biker boys?

165
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,100
All right, biker boys,
show me those abs.

166
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:24,580
OK.

167
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,626
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex.

168
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:32,327
That's what we want,
beautiful, tight, chunky abs.

169
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:33,589
Oil the abs.

170
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:41,466
I want a boa
constrictor or a python.

171
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:42,816
Morning, ladies. 10 minutes.

172
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:43,686
Morning.

173
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:45,557
Let's go!

174
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:47,951
I don't know, Mary.

175
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:52,260
I'm sort of giving up
on the whole human race.

176
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,741
Why, honey, what's the matter?

177
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,352
Everybody is so superficial.

178
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:58,266
Oh.

179
00:10:58,396 --> 00:10:59,746
I am sick of it.

180
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:03,619
I am sick of all this
superficial bullshit.

181
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,230
I'm a very spiritual person.

182
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,361
Are you really?

183
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:09,756
Oh, very spiritual.

184
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,627
Have you seen "The
Little Mermaid"?

185
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:14,064
The cartoon?

186
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:17,502
Oh, it's not just
a cartoon, Mary.

187
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:19,722
If you look just
a little closer,

188
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:22,072
you will find a spiritualmessage
in every single one

189
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:25,032
of Walt Disney's films.

190
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:28,122
Could we please change
this fucking music?

191
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:29,863
Oh, sure, baby.

192
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:30,993
What do you want to hear?

193
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,038
Hole?

194
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,301
Snoopy dog dog?

195
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:34,650
Any... anything, OK?

196
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:35,956
Christ.

197
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:38,654
Douche would be
better than this shit.

198
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:39,916
It's depressing.

199
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,613
Is Douche good?

200
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:44,747
I'm not going to be able
towork with this depressing shit.

201
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:46,793
It's 10 o'clock, and
I'm already depressed.

202
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,074
I... I look depressed, don't I?

203
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:49,143
No.

204
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,710
No.

205
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,929
You look beautiful.

206
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,080
Hey, ya little baby.

207
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,037
Come here, sweetheart.

208
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,299
Hey!

209
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,755
What the hell's the
matter with you?

210
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,649
- What?
- Don't what me.

211
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,651
You know what I'm talking about.

212
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,151
What if that was
your granddaughter?

213
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,133
Huh?

214
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:24,700
You old fucking scumbag.

215
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:25,832
Hey, just leave me alone.

216
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,757
Jesus.

217
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,851
Excuse me.

218
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,548
Do I know you?

219
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:48,724
No, I... I don't think so.

220
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:50,695
God, the way you smiled
at me, I feel like I've

221
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,163
known you my whole life.

222
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,904
That's so sweet.

223
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,472
Are you in a relationship?

224
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,604
Yes, I am.

225
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:01,693
You don't sound
very happy about it.

226
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,739
Well, I... I love my
girlfriend very much.

227
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,395
It's just that I
don't think that she

228
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:10,702
understands me in a real
emotional or sexual way.

229
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,573
Yeah.

230
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:15,142
I sense that in you.

231
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:18,319
You know, this is going
to sound really crazy.

232
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:20,800
But I feel like I've
knownyou my whole life too.

233
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:21,930
Really?

234
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:23,672
Yeah.

235
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,371
And I'd like to give you
a blow job right now.

236
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:28,851
Right now?

237
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:29,982
Do you mind?

238
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,518
You didn't go in?

239
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:45,085
No, I didn't go in.

240
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:46,260
I'm in a relationship.

241
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,524
I can't go sniffingevery
bird that flies by.

242
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:50,917
She was a real blonde?

243
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,687
Kind of hard to tell
from the street, Bob.

244
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:53,833
Yeah.

245
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,225
I know what you mean.

246
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,358
I met this model last night.

247
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:59,751
I thought she was blonde
tillwe got back to her place.

248
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,753
It turned out she was fake.

249
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,494
Straight out of a bottle.

250
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,408
It's too bad.

251
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:06,062
She was sweet too.

252
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:07,237
What?

253
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:08,475
You're not going
to see her again

254
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,023
because she dyes her hair?

255
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:11,153
Let's go.

256
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:12,373
All right, lads.

257
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:13,243
Look sharp.

258
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:16,203
Come on.

259
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,334
All right, gentlemen.

260
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:18,727
Front and center.

261
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,163
Everyone pay attention.

262
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,731
You will divide into
eight two-man squads.

263
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,081
First man in pours the red wine.

264
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:27,040
Second man in serves
the finger food.

265
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,781
And it is called fingerfood
precisely because it is

266
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,219
to be eaten with the fingers.

267
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:33,349
No utensils.

268
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:34,743
Any questions?

269
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,353
Ernst, I have a question.

270
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:37,615
Are you wearing a girdle?

271
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,666
Because your ass
looksincredible in those pants.

272
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:43,994
No, I am not wearing a girdle.

273
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:45,817
But you can be assuredthat
if I catch any of you

274
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,712
faggots looking at
my ass, I'll fire

275
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:50,367
the whole fucking lot of you.

276
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:54,154
Hey, Ernst, we're
not all gay, you know.

277
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:58,027
That, my dear, straight
friend, is your problem.

278
00:14:58,158 --> 00:14:59,158
To your stations.

279
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:35,063
What is your name?

280
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,152
Joe. Joe Finnegan.

281
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:37,632
Who hired you? Did I hire you?

282
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:38,502
Yes, you did.

283
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,721
I was recommended by Bob.

284
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:41,177
Don't ever let
the neck of a bottle

285
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:42,506
touch the rim of the glass.

286
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:43,812
And smile, for god's sake.

287
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,583
You look like you're
at a fucking funeral.

288
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:05,399
My balls are killing me.

289
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:06,791
Why?

290
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:08,706
That model I was
with last night.

291
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:09,969
She was like an animal.

292
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,099
19.

293
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,747
One of those tight
little asses you just

294
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,538
want to take a bite out of.

295
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:17,106
Jesus.

296
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:18,301
Where did you meet her?
- This bar.

297
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:19,369
TNA.

298
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,415
I'll take you down there.

299
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:24,113
All the chicks there are
thesegorgeous high-class models,

300
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:25,288
even the waitresses.

301
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,874
If they're such
high-class models, what

302
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,335
are they doing waitressing?

303
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:29,553
Hey, you're doing it.

304
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:30,946
So are you.

305
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,209
Not for much longer, pal.

306
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,559
Guess who just got
a part on a soap?

307
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,734
Get out of here.

308
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:38,432
Passion Crest.

309
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,869
Recurring character...
Dirk Drake.

310
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,739
I wouldn't do a soap.

311
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,480
It's not even acting.

312
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:45,482
$3,600 a week.

313
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:49,791
Act that, you sorry,
broke-ass fucking waiter.

314
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,227
Feel the jeans, Sahara.

315
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:52,358
Come on.

316
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,229
Feel those jeans.

317
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,100
Yeah.

318
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,970
Feel it.

319
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,101
Come on, go for it.

320
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:56,885
You know where it is.

321
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,755
Let's go.

322
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:58,950
You're not with me, Sahara.

323
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:00,715
Come on, Sahara.

324
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:02,717
All right, kill the fan.

325
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:05,024
Sahara, you know
that I love you?

326
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:06,154
Yes.

327
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,639
And you know that
you're my favorite?

328
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,332
Oh, yes.

329
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,943
That's why I want you
to go deeper with me.

330
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,946
I want the pure essence
of your sexuality.

331
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,315
I thought that's
what I was doing.

332
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,079
You are.

333
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,602
But this woman is...

334
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,648
She's fearless, just like you.

335
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:22,128
She's bold.

336
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,217
She can do something
a little kinky,

337
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:28,743
maybe a little dirty, sexually,
and be absolutely fine with it.

338
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:29,613
Understand?

339
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:30,788
I think so.

340
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:31,659
Good.

341
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,443
Good.

342
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:37,056
Maybe you should just shoother
getting fucked by a poodle.

343
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:39,145
Why a poodle?

344
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,843
I've always wanted
a Jack Russell.

345
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:46,456
You ever feel
like fooling around?

346
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:47,327
Sure.

347
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:48,502
Sometimes I get the urge.

348
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:51,113
You know, just
like everyone else.

349
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:53,768
Basically,
I'd say thatMary and I are pretty happy.

350
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:54,986
Well, that's good.

351
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,205
Yeah, you know.

352
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:59,295
Sex is good.

353
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,862
Could be a little better.

354
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:03,604
Sometimes I wish Mary
was a little bit more...

355
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,171
What?

356
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:09,523
I wish sometimes that
she'djust go a little bit wild,

357
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:12,091
like you said that model
did... go crazy on me.

358
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:14,658
See, I need that, Bob.

359
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,530
Well, come on, man.

360
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,097
Look on the bright side.

361
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:19,359
You've got stability, right?

362
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:22,013
Some people need that.

363
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,165
All right, I'm heading this way.

364
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,451
When do you start the soap?

365
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,409
Tomorrow morning, my friend.

366
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,900
Then I guess I
won't be seeing you.

367
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:28,759
No.

368
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,327
Hey, come on.

369
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,981
We'll get together.

370
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,312
I'll give you a call sometime.

371
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:39,509
Dirk Drake, huh?

372
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,076
Passion Crest.

373
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:46,342
$3,600 a week!

374
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:49,302
What is wrong with
people, you know?

375
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:50,992
Every day it seems
like everybody's just

376
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:54,133
getting stupider and stupider.

377
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:57,701
You seem rather
agitated today, Mary.

378
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:58,876
I am agitated.

379
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,574
I am.

380
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,421
You know,
every morning Ipass this guy in the street.

381
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:05,144
And he always makes
somedisgusting comment to me.

382
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,537
Why don't you take
a different route?

383
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:09,670
Because I don't want to
take a different route.

384
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,934
Why should I let that
scumbagdictate how I live my life?

385
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:14,196
Mm-hmm.

386
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,000
What I feel like doingis
taking him by the hair

387
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,824
and smashing his face
right into the sidewalk.

388
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:21,508
Perhaps wecan find a more productive

389
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:23,771
outlet for your anger.

390
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:27,992
Another female patient of
mineis taking a self-defense class

391
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:29,820
that is quite unique.

392
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,170
I don't need self-defense.

393
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,171
Hear me out, Mary.

394
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:33,301
OK.

395
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:34,989
Theinstructor has apparently

396
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:38,786
devised a series of
exercisesdesigned to help women cope

397
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,877
with the more
ordinaryrudenesses they encounter

398
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,618
on a day-to-day basis.

399
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:48,056
I'm going to get
histelephone number for you.

400
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,580
And you call him when
you feel like it.

401
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,408
A physical activity
like this might

402
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:58,022
alleviate some of
thathostility you have for men.

403
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:01,983
Am I hostile towards men?

404
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,767
We'll talk about that next week.

405
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:05,465
Oh, OK.

406
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,312
And might I
addthat blouse you're wearing

407
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:10,557
is especially becoming.

408
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:11,687
Thank you, Dr. Leuter.

409
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:24,571
You know, Biff,
sometimes Iwant to just rip my clothes off

410
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,462
in the middle of thatstore
and outbox that god

411
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,749
damn sales merchandise manager.

412
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:32,100
I mean... ah!

413
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:32,970
Sorry.

414
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:36,017
I... I, uh, forgot my line.

415
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,147
Oh, that's all right.

416
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:40,848
Really, really it is, Joe.

417
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:43,242
So well, we have a littleproblem
with your credits here.

418
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:46,767
I mean, there's no TV,
no commercials, no soaps.

419
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,657
I'm not that interested
in doing soap operas.

420
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:50,858
Oh.

421
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,468
Why is that?

422
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,999
Well, that's not
even acting, is it?

423
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:56,516
I mean,
not the kind ofacting that I want to do.

424
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:57,952
I mean, it's fake.

425
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,519
And it's stupid.

426
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:00,931
Well,
it's clear thatyou and I have absolutely

427
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:01,999
nothing to talk about.

428
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,870
Goodbye.

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,872
Excuse me, Miss Taylor.

430
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,743
What did I say?

431
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:10,007
What every other no name,
no credit actor says when

432
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:11,400
he comes through that door.

433
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,489
I mean, who the hell
do you think you are?

434
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,882
Tom Cruise?

435
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:16,012
Well, you're not.

436
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,928
And believe me,
you're stupid if you

437
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,341
think that I would
hire any actor who

438
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,192
wasn't damn willing to work.

439
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,387
Well, you misunderstood. I'm...

440
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:23,760
This is a business.

441
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,197
If you don't understand that,
then you don't belong in it.

442
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,243
Go away.

443
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,592
You're right, Miss Taylor.

444
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,202
This is a business.

445
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,900
I understand that.

446
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,598
I'm beginning to
understand that.

447
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,253
I didn't mean that I
wouldn't work on a soap.

448
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,405
If there was something that
youthought I could do, of course

449
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:41,429
I would do it.

450
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:42,213
Really.

451
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,998
I would love to work on a soap.

452
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:45,129
How old are you?

453
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
35.

454
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:51,614
35.

455
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:56,358
No credits, no agent.

456
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:59,883
All right, let's get real, Joe.

457
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:02,669
Have you got a bathing suit?

458
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,539
I could get one.

459
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,975
Good.

460
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:07,674
There's a Madonna video comingup,
kind of a beach theme.

461
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:09,589
You might be right for it.

462
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:13,636
Unless, of course, you
don't do music videos.

463
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:16,378
Of course I do.

464
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,162
That would be
great, Miss Taylor.

465
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:19,947
Or is it Dee Dee?

466
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:20,861
Thanks, Joe.

467
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:21,991
I'll be in touch.

468
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,218
Hey, guys.

469
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,874
Come on back and see Chavonne,
New York's hottest blonde.

470
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:37,094
She's a college girlmajoring in sexy,
sexy, sexy.

471
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:38,269
That's right.

472
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,402
You there in the overcoat...

473
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,100
This, uh, college chick.

474
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:43,971
Is she a real blonde?

475
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:44,841
Oh, yeah.

476
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:46,234
Beautiful.

477
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,192
Sexy, sexy chick, man.

478
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:50,456
Like Madonna, but blonde.

479
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:51,586
Very blonde.

480
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:55,025
All right, so I'll
take a buck's worth.

481
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:56,026
Here he comes.

482
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:57,376
He knows the real thing.

483
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,203
How about you other guys, huh?

484
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,615
Don't you want to see Chavonne,
New York's hottest blonde.

485
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:30,844
Thank you.

486
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:33,150
I love this little puppy.

487
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:34,151
I love her. I love her.

488
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:35,849
I love her. I love her.

489
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:36,719
We love her too.

490
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,243
Don't we, Cassiopeia?

491
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:40,593
Hey there, little Cassie.

492
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:42,290
We don't call her Cassie, Joe.

493
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,596
We have a strict rule.

494
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,685
Her whole name or
no name at all.

495
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:46,860
Sorry.

496
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,078
That's a good rule.

497
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,993
It's so great to see you guys.

498
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:52,039
It's been too long.

499
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,955
We've been absolutelycrazed
since Alex's show.

500
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,261
Absolutely crazed.

501
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:59,046
I'm in three galleries now.

502
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:01,875
The paintings are selling
sofast I don't even have time

503
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,834
to stretch a canvas.

504
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:07,205
If you need a job, Joe,
Icould put you to work tomorrow.

505
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,315
Oh, thanks.

506
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:10,013
I got a job.

507
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:12,973
You know, I don't think
we'veseen you since "Il Piano."

508
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,148
Oh, my god.

509
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:15,323
I love that movie.

510
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,586
Wasn't that a great movie?

511
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:20,023
A great, great flick.

512
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:22,417
One of the best, really.

513
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,419
That movie was a piece of shit.

514
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,642
Are you kidding?

515
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:30,773
No, I'm not kidding.

516
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,209
Come on.

517
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,057
It was nothing but a
glorified romance novel.

518
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:37,214
Spirited, sensuous young
womanleaves her uptight husband

519
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:41,262
for the man of her dreams,
amasculine but sensitive native

520
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:43,786
with earrings and tattoos.

521
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:44,700
Sorry, Joe.

522
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:46,746
But I think you
completely missed

523
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,051
what this film was about.

524
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:49,226
Oh.

525
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,446
What was it about?

526
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:53,317
Well, it was about
a lot of things.

527
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:56,059
It was about courage, freedom.

528
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,281
It was about unrestricted,
unconditional, primal love.

529
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:03,197
Yeah, you're way
off on this, man.

530
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,633
I'm just curious.

531
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,287
Has anyone seen "The
Little Mermaid"?

532
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:10,770
Besides, it was only on
everytop 10 list in the country.

533
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,249
So what?

534
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,097
What are those two going
to dofor the rest of their lives,

535
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,521
stand around and
stare at each other

536
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,080
all loving and unconditional?

537
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:19,189
Do you think that they'll
everhave a real argument the way

538
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,823
that real people do?

539
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:23,173
Do you think that she wouldever say to him,
hey, Kimba,

540
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,698
you know,
I really loveyour masculine sensitivity,

541
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:27,526
but do you think
that just once you

542
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:28,936
could remember to
lift the toilet

543
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,572
seat before you take a piss?

544
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:32,052
I completely agree with you.

545
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:34,750
My boyfriend loved the movieso much,
I broke up with him.

546
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:35,621
Which movie?

547
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:36,578
"Il Piano."

548
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:37,709
Yeah.

549
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:39,078
What the hell was
that movie all about?

550
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,103
I liked it. - Huh?

551
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:41,516
You liked
Harvey Keitel's ass.

552
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,932
No, that's utterly untrue.

553
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:44,103
I did not like that movie.

554
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:45,476
But what else was
there to like about it?

555
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,196
What are they talking about?

556
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,111
"Il Piano."

557
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,591
Great photography.

558
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:51,027
That little girl bugged me.

559
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,353
If I had a daughter like that,
I'd kick her fucking ass.

560
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:54,577
- Yeah.
- You ask me something.

561
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,164
You don't wait for me to answer.

562
00:25:57,294 --> 00:25:58,469
As it should be.

563
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,040
Who the hell wants
to see a man nude?

564
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:00,863
Who cares?

565
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,952
I thought it was incredible.

566
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,259
I cried through most of it.

567
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:06,789
You did cry, and
I was proud of you.

568
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:17,010
You went on and
on and on about it.

569
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,099
I mean, it was a
little embarrassing.

570
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:21,405
Well, I just didn't feellike
listening to him blab

571
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:23,103
about his paintings all night.

572
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:25,105
Did you hear that
little dig about a job?

573
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:26,759
What dig?

574
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:30,806
That I could come
workfor him stretching canvases.

575
00:26:30,937 --> 00:26:32,939
What do I look like,
a fucking handyman?

576
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:36,725
Joe, why are you so angry?

577
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,466
Did your audition go badly? Is that it?

578
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,336
No.

579
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:40,467
Actually, it went great.

580
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,122
I really nailed the monologue.

581
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:44,559
And afterward,
she lookedat my resume and said,

582
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,970
you don't have
any soaps on here.

583
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:46,735
And I said, I know I don't.

584
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:48,041
You want to know why?

585
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:51,871
Because I don't
consider that acting.

586
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,307
- You said that?
- Yep.

587
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:54,308
And you know what?

588
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:55,222
She may have something
for me already.

589
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:56,397
What?

590
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:57,311
A Madonna video.

591
00:26:57,441 --> 00:27:00,444
Joe, that's fantastic.

592
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:01,813
I mean, that could
lead to something.

593
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,012
And it's money, right?

594
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:04,143
That's right, Mary.

595
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:04,927
That's what I'm learning.

596
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:05,841
It's a business.

597
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:07,234
It's all a business.

598
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,191
Guess what?

599
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:10,454
I might take a
self-defense class.

600
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:11,717
Why?

601
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,172
Well, Dr.
Leuter said it might

602
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:15,111
help me deal with my hostility.

603
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:16,591
Your what?

604
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:18,985
Uh, the assholes on the street.

605
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:19,855
Oh.

606
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:21,117
Well, that's great.

607
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:22,965
So that's what you guys
talk about in there?

608
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:24,468
That and other things.

609
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,818
Why?

610
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:26,948
Just curious.

611
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:30,736
Bob got a job on a soap.

612
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,607
He's not doing the
catering anymore.

613
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:35,392
Told me he met
this blonde model.

614
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:38,395
They went back to her
placeand had kinky sex all night.

615
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:39,832
Is that what you'd like?

616
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:42,225
Kinky sex with a blonde model?

617
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:43,986
Well,
she wouldn'tnecessarily have to be a model.

618
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,706
What?

619
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:46,447
I'm not kinky enough for you?

620
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:48,318
I never said that.

621
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:49,189
You implied it.

622
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,234
I did not.

623
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,889
I was simply telling youabout
what happened to Bob.

624
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,369
Of course, you're kinky.

625
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:59,721
You're very kinky, OK?

626
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:02,985
We both know that
sometimes I have to...

627
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,160
What?

628
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,118
Well, you know.

629
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,554
No.

630
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,816
Initiate things.

631
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:08,687
You do not.

632
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,210
What about this morning?

633
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,778
Well, actually, if you recall,
I suggested that we make love.

634
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:15,650
And your first response was no.

635
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,043
Christ.

636
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:19,001
I thought we had a
pretty healthy sex life.

637
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:20,892
And now you're telling
me you're bored with me?

638
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,091
Could just hold on a second?

639
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,702
The only thing
that I'm suggesting

640
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:28,054
is that perhaps we could be
alittle bit more spontaneous.

641
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,925
How?

642
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:32,058
Well, for one
thing, by not having

643
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:34,234
to wear a rubber all the time.

644
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:35,626
I'm sorry, Joe.

645
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:38,238
I don't want to get pregnant.

646
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:39,848
It just seems a
little bit odd to me

647
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:42,982
that for somebody who's
soagainst getting pregnant,

648
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,201
you seem to be
infatuated with babies.

649
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:47,856
I mean, Christ,
you were allover that little Tapioca.

650
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:48,987
Cassiopeia.

651
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:49,815
And so what?

652
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:52,426
I like babies.

653
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:55,995
I just don't want to
have one of my own.

654
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,257
That's great.

655
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:58,432
Why?

656
00:28:58,562 --> 00:28:59,642
Do you want to have a baby?

657
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,895
I'm not going to have
akid until we can afford it.

658
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,442
What does money
have to do with it?

659
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:09,399
You don't have any.

660
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,749
Other people have kids.

661
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:11,880
How do they do it?

662
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:14,143
Either they hire
somebody, or one of them

663
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:15,730
stays home and takes
care of the baby.

664
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,148
Are you going to do it?

665
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,760
If you think I'm going to giveup my career,
you're crazy.

666
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:25,328
What are we talking
about this for?

667
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:26,199
You brought it up.

668
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:27,853
No, I didn't.

669
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:29,961
I was talking about
somethingcompletely different.

670
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:32,858
Well, what were
you talking about?

671
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:36,209
Let's just drop it, OK?

672
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:38,689
And now you're all pissed off.

673
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,820
What makes you say that?

674
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,536
You know that I neverthought
I'd see you again?

675
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,975
I told you I'd
call you, didn't I?

676
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:06,761
Yes, but I thoughtmaybe you didn't like me.

677
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,241
Hey, what's not to like?

678
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:16,292
Do you like my eyes?

679
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:17,467
Mm-hmm.

680
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:19,382
Do you like my body?

681
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:20,688
Oh, yeah.

682
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,518
Do you like my hair?

683
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:27,086
Do you?

684
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:29,001
What's the matter?

685
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:30,306
Nothing.

686
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:31,568
Oh, come on.

687
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:33,919
What's the matter?

688
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:34,789
Excuse me.

689
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,659
Bob, come on.

690
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,400
Wait.

691
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:38,651
What's wrong? - God damn it.

692
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:39,750
I said nothing was wrong!

693
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:44,494
There's a message.

694
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:45,800
Did you hear this?

695
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:46,670
No.

696
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:48,020
It's probably for you.

697
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:50,587
MADONNA Hi, this is Madonna.

698
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:52,502
It's Wednesday, about 2:55.

699
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,808
Sorry for calling so late.

700
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,505
I'm trying to
reach Joe Finnegan.

701
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:58,639
Joe, can you please call
me immediately at 555...

702
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:02,121
Jesus fucking Christ.

703
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:03,707
- Do you really think it's
her?- Of course it's her.

704
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:04,906
Who else would it be?

705
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,275
She's probably calling
about the video.

706
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,476
MADONNA... immediately at 555-0270.

707
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:12,871
You know, Joe,
Madonna isan international superstar.

708
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:17,179
I mean, I seriously doubt
she'sgoing to call you at home.

709
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,462
At the very least,
she'd haveher assistant call, right?

710
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,575
Mary, I've heard she
gets personally involved

711
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:23,359
in all of her projects.

712
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,709
She probably saw my
pictureon the wall and said, hey,

713
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,408
maybe I'll feature Joe
Finnegan in my video.

714
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:29,757
All right.

715
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,802
All right, well, call her.

716
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,500
Well, it's only 9:00.

717
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,651
She's probably still sleeping.

718
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:35,415
Oh.

719
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:36,416
OK.

720
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:38,766
I'm going then.

721
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,463
Hey, call me if you reach her.

722
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:41,595
Oh, I will. Bye.

723
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:42,725
Bye.

724
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:10,537
Hey, baby.

725
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:11,451
Come sit on my face.

726
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:13,366
Oh, grow up, you stupid asshole.

727
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:14,367
Get angry, baby!

728
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:15,237
I like it!

729
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:16,368
Makes my dick hard.

730
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:17,283
See?

731
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:18,632
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.

732
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:27,119
Ah!

733
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:27,989
Ah.

734
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,078
Why do you say that shit, huh?

735
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,384
Why?

736
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:32,385
God, stop!

737
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:33,864
Stop, please!

738
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:35,016
No, I'm not going to
fucking stop until you

739
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,345
tell me why you say it.

740
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:38,521
Do you think you're goingto
meet women this way?

741
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:42,177
You think some woman is
goingto turn around and say, hey,

742
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:44,310
there's a fucking guy
I'd like to go out with?

743
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,964
No!

744
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:50,272
No... I'm just a coward,
amiserable fucking coward.

745
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:52,231
Ohh.

746
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:56,713
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.

747
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:06,071
Dirk, I'm so happy I could cry.

748
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,074
Don't even think of it, Deanna.

749
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:12,164
I wish I could tellMother
about the wedding.

750
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:15,950
We will, as soon as
she's out of the coma.

751
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:20,172
But Dirk, that
could take forever.

752
00:33:20,302 --> 00:33:21,302
Until then.

753
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,219
Mm.

754
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:46,763
Cut!

755
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:48,069
What's next, cis?

756
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,375
Age 35.

757
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:52,160
Living room, Garth finds
out Sandy is his sister.

758
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:53,291
20 minutes to set up.

759
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:54,467
OK!

760
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:55,816
Let's hear it for Bob!

761
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:56,946
Whoo!

762
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:22,625
Enter.

763
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:23,887
Hey, Bob.

764
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:24,758
Whoa.

765
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:27,369
Great fucking abs, man.

766
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,501
Thanks, Roy.

767
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:30,720
We should work
out together sometime.

768
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,113
Yeah, we should.

769
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:34,164
Hey,
did you see theratings are up three points?

770
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:35,029
Saw that.

771
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,899
Yeah, yeah.

772
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,030
Keep that up, homes.

773
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,293
Yeah.

774
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:40,339
Hey, did you sign
those contracts yet?

775
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,124
Any day, Roy.

776
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:46,214
Fucking Valentino, man.

777
00:34:46,345 --> 00:34:48,564
"Bring me no more reports.

778
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:50,131
Let them fly all.

779
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:52,960
Till Birnam wood
remove to Dunsinane.

780
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,353
What's the boy, Malcolm?"

781
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:55,483
You decent?

782
00:34:58,183 --> 00:34:59,706
Yes.

783
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:00,836
Too bad.

784
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:06,669
Ah, Deanna, I see your innocence

785
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,889
is merely a part you play.

786
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,760
Hmm.

787
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,545
You're a good actor, Bob.

788
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:13,676
Thanks.

789
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:14,938
Thank you.

790
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:15,809
And so are you.

791
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,551
I know I am.

792
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:21,554
You know, we could have
donea lot more with that scene.

793
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:22,468
Which scene?

794
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,252
The kiss.

795
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:26,428
Oh, are you kidding?

796
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,493
That little tickle thingyou
did with your tongue?

797
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:29,605
I swear.

798
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:31,366
If I didn't have onthree
pairs of underwear,

799
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,740
I might have knocked
over a light stand.

800
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,525
Shut up!

801
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:38,310
Oh, damn, Kelly.

802
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,486
You're a nice girl.

803
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:43,402
Too bad you're not real blonde.

804
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:44,751
What are you talking about?

805
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,753
Don't even try to
bullshit me, Kelly.

806
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:50,452
I know a real blonde
when I see one.

807
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:53,673
Well, then you must
be fucking blind.

808
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,588
Wait a second.

809
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:59,418
Are you telling me that
you are a real blonde?

810
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,681
Head to toe.

811
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:03,596
Wanna see my driver's license?

812
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:05,163
No.

813
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:06,933
I don't want to see
your driver's license.

814
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:24,225
Satisfied?

815
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:25,356
Close the door.

816
00:36:55,517 --> 00:37:00,696
What you want,
you ain't gonna get it.

817
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:02,089
Sahara, where were you?

818
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,046
I just called you.

819
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:03,960
Oh, hey.

820
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,571
Mary... - Oh, my god.

821
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:06,789
What happened?

822
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,114
Yesterday, I went rollerblading

823
00:37:08,138 --> 00:37:09,444
with this guy I just met.

824
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:10,967
And somehow I got
too close to him,

825
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:12,404
and his elbow hit me in the eye.

826
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,294
I know it was my fault.
I feel really stupid.

827
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:15,806
- Oh, Jesus.
- But can you cover it?

828
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:16,756
Oh, my god.

829
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:18,326
You would not believe
what I am going

830
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,889
through with those
fucking snakes.

831
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,282
Oh, my god!

832
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:22,607
Blair, I'm so sorry.
It was an accident.

833
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:23,415
Is it real?

834
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:24,285
Yeah, it's real.

835
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,199
Yes.

836
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,481
Mary, you have to get rid of it.

837
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:27,288
It's not the bruise.

838
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:28,681
I can cover the bruise.

839
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:30,136
But the problem is the swelling. I mean...

840
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,900
Oh, no.

841
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:33,294
I've got to shoot today.

842
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:35,905
I booked those snakes
a month in advance.

843
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:37,579
Well, you're just
going to have to shoot

844
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:38,623
her with a black eye then.

845
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:39,647
Oh, are you crazy?

846
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:45,785
Dark, dark.

847
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:47,221
Bruise is truth.

848
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,527
We must never hide it.

849
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:49,702
Yes.

850
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:52,574
Bring in the serpents.

851
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:53,445
Yes.

852
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:54,775
Now wrap them around her legs.

853
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:57,797
Ah.

854
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:58,667
Ah-ha.

855
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:00,147
Ah-ha.

856
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,540
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

857
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,845
That's it. Everybody clear.

858
00:38:02,976 --> 00:38:03,716
Everybody clear. Let's shoot.

859
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:04,846
Let's shoot.

860
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:05,761
Roses.

861
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:06,936
Right now!

862
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,067
More!

863
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:13,552
Yes!

864
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:14,944
Oh, yes!

865
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:16,990
Powerful, powerful.

866
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,905
No blame, Sahara.

867
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:20,035
No blame, Kiki.

868
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,659
To the side.

869
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:34,984
Yeah,
OK.

870
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,096
All right.

871
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:37,506
I'll take that
call in my office.

872
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:38,403
Oh!

873
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,666
Where is... Oh, yeah.

874
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:41,796
Oh, Jim.

875
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:42,929
Hi.

876
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:44,060
No, it's Joe Finnegan.

877
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:45,888
Joe, I'm sorry.

878
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,063
Joe, of course.

879
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:48,587
Missy, get a shot of his back.

880
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:50,284
Would you turn around?

881
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:51,154
Mm-hmm.

882
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:52,634
Good.

883
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:56,290
Look, could you... give mesomething sexy,
a look...

884
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:57,160
Sexy?

885
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,031
Yeah, sexy.

886
00:38:58,161 --> 00:38:59,337
Yeah, sexy.

887
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,817
Yeah, be confident.

888
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:03,732
Oh, OK.

889
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:05,212
That's good. Thanks.

890
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,692
Excuse me.

891
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:09,042
Uh, Dee Dee, did Madonna
speak to you about me?

892
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:09,912
About you? No.

893
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,087
Why?

894
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:12,393
Well, it's a funny thing.

895
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:15,091
But I got a phone call lefton
my answering machine.

896
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,156
And I... I keep calling,
but there's never an answer

897
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,443
at the number she left.

898
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:20,029
Well, what do you
suppose it was about?

899
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,204
I assumed that it had something

900
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:22,098
to do with this video...

901
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,511
You know, maybe she
wanted to give me

902
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:24,753
a special cameo or something.

903
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:28,757
Ha... Joe,
there are nospecial cameos in the video.

904
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:30,213
We'll try and get you
in the front row, huh?

905
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:31,301
And so you got the address.

906
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,545
You got the, uh, bathing suit.

907
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,131
Be prepared to spend all day.- OK, great.

908
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,809
I'm excited.

909
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:40,073
Dee Dee, are there any
soapscoming up I could audition for?

910
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:40,943
Not right now.

911
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:43,076
Any plays or films?

912
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:46,296
Not at the moment.

913
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:51,780
Oh, Joe, do you think
you could play a rapist?

914
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:53,260
Yeah, I think so.

915
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,915
How about a serial killer?

916
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:57,090
Yeah.

917
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,420
Yeah, I think I could do that.

918
00:39:58,526 --> 00:39:59,808
I think you could too.
You're... you're young.

919
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:01,442
You're hip. You're sexy.

920
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:02,878
I think you'd be perfect for it.

921
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:04,358
Yeah.

922
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,118
Yeah, I'm going to keep
myeye out for that kind of role.

923
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:08,318
And as soon as I findsomething,
I'll let you know.

924
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:09,450
Great!

925
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:10,581
Thanks, Dee Dee!

926
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:43,005
Pick it up.

927
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:44,354
Pick that up now.

928
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:45,486
Go, go.

929
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:46,617
Jesus.

930
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:56,932
Oh, no.

931
00:40:57,063 --> 00:40:58,978
It's a little town near Buffalo.

932
00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:00,172
I've never
been to Buffalo.

933
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:01,546
Yeah.

934
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:04,723
I'd rather go to
Tahiti or Montserrat.

935
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:05,593
Montserrat's fine.

936
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:06,464
But you got to fly there.

937
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:07,874
You could take the bus up to it.

938
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:12,078
Joe!

939
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,558
Alex, look, it's Joe.

940
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:14,428
You're right.

941
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,038
It is Joe.

942
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:17,562
Hey, there, buddy.

943
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:19,085
What are you guys doing here?

944
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:22,567
I'm on the board because
theMet bought six of my paintings.

945
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:23,916
Oh.

946
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:25,763
Then you're getting itstretched all right,
huh?

947
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:26,832
This is so funny.

948
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:28,529
Joe, you're working.

949
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,357
Yeah, I got to pay the bills.

950
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,488
Great tuxedo, man.

951
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,272
Thanks.

952
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:33,621
It's secondhand.

953
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:34,579
Hey, you know what?

954
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,189
I'm doing a Madonna
video tomorrow.

955
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,930
I love Madonna.

956
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,148
You know, we know her.

957
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:40,628
Yes, she called me.

958
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:42,171
She... she wants me to do
a special featured cameo

959
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:42,935
or something.

960
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:46,329
That is just like her.

961
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,200
Tell her I said hi.

962
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,854
I will.

963
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:51,770
And tell Mary
weshould get together real soon.

964
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,640
OK.

965
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:53,771
It's so great.

966
00:41:56,818 --> 00:41:58,124
Excuse me, sir.

967
00:41:58,254 --> 00:41:59,536
Is there anything
else I can get you?

968
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,213
Perhaps some more whipped cream?

969
00:42:00,343 --> 00:42:02,389
No, thank you, captain.

970
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,720
Got to keep shipshape for
allthese fillies around here.

971
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:06,349
You know what I mean?

972
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Aye, aye, Captain.

973
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:13,356
What are you doing?

974
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:14,725
He asked me about
the strawberries,

975
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:16,098
how they got so big.

976
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:18,448
Never, ever touch a guest, ever.

977
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:19,928
I'm sorry, Ernst.
Nobody told me.

978
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:21,103
OK, OK, OK.

979
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:21,974
Just go, go, go, go, go.

980
00:42:22,104 --> 00:42:23,264
God damn, you fucking whores.

981
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:30,330
Let's begin today by
reviewing a few facts.

982
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,463
Men are physically
stronger than women.

983
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,640
This is not a criticism
of your gender, ladies.

984
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,989
It is a fact.

985
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,819
Fact... you as women
are vulnerable.

986
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:42,690
Vulnerable, but not helpless.

987
00:42:42,821 --> 00:42:46,041
This class will provide each
andevery one of you with a simple

988
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:49,436
and effective means
ofself-defense in the event

989
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,658
of a physical assault. Fact...

990
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:55,181
There are other
types of assault...

991
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:58,227
Verbal harassment on the
streets, blatant groping

992
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:00,273
and fondling in public places...

993
00:43:00,403 --> 00:43:05,017
All the behavioral tics
thatmake men so irresistible.

994
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:08,150
Now, my research has shown
thatthese assaults can be equally

995
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:13,416
damaging if the rage and
thefrustration that they arouse

996
00:43:13,547 --> 00:43:15,462
are not released.

997
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,985
And to that end,
I have developed

998
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:21,903
a series of patented
exercisesdesigned to increase your RRQ.

999
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:23,165
Class?

1000
00:43:23,296 --> 00:43:25,646
Rage Release Quotient.

1001
00:43:25,777 --> 00:43:27,605
Good.

1002
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:30,259
Sheila, why don't you come up
tothe front of the class, please?

1003
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:35,003
Thank you.

1004
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:40,095
Now, remember,
you canrespond however you feel, OK?

1005
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:42,532
If you wish to
scream, scream away.

1006
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:45,361
If you feel like strikingme,
go ahead and do so.

1007
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:46,362
Understand?

1008
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:48,147
I think so.

1009
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:50,540
All right, let's begin.

1010
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,672
Looking good, sweet meat.

1011
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:56,590
Sweet meat?

1012
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:58,766
Did you hear what I said?

1013
00:43:58,897 --> 00:43:59,767
Yes.

1014
00:43:59,898 --> 00:44:02,074
Do you like being
called sweet meat?

1015
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:04,032
No.

1016
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:05,643
Does it make you angry?

1017
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:06,513
Yes.

1018
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,255
How angry?

1019
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:11,170
Very angry.

1020
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,650
OK.

1021
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,695
How do you feel?

1022
00:44:14,826 --> 00:44:15,609
Better.

1023
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,307
OK.

1024
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:20,353
OK, Mary.

1025
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:21,523
Come to the front, please.

1026
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:28,187
Let's begin.

1027
00:44:28,317 --> 00:44:31,451
Man, you got some sweetlittle ass on you,
cupcake.

1028
00:44:31,581 --> 00:44:33,583
Shut the fuck up!

1029
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:36,021
I'd take a nice little biteout
of that sweet little ass,

1030
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:37,151
cupcake.

1031
00:44:52,211 --> 00:44:53,211
You OK?

1032
00:44:53,299 --> 00:44:54,343
Yeah.

1033
00:44:54,474 --> 00:44:55,127
That was great.

1034
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:58,217
It was.

1035
00:44:58,347 --> 00:44:59,914
He brought me up to the class.

1036
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:01,805
And he's telling me, youknow,
just go ahead and do

1037
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:02,980
whatever you feel like doing.

1038
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:04,745
I mean, it was just incredible.

1039
00:45:04,876 --> 00:45:06,747
I started punching
and swinging at him.

1040
00:45:06,878 --> 00:45:09,204
I mean, I never knew it wouldfeel
this good to hit somebody,

1041
00:45:09,228 --> 00:45:10,272
you know?

1042
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:11,143
That's great.

1043
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:12,579
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- I did!

1044
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,711
I did!

1045
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:15,147
And this teacher
is so fantastic.

1046
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:17,062
He said I have a
really high RRQ.

1047
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:18,411
RRQ?

1048
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,805
Rage Release Quotient!

1049
00:45:20,935 --> 00:45:22,632
He said I have the
highest in the class.

1050
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,156
Ha.

1051
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:29,639
99.3!

1052
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,120
Maybe I should take that class.

1053
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:33,532
Alex and Raina were at
that dinner tonight.

1054
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:34,644
Oh?

1055
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:36,057
He made a comment
about my tuxedo,

1056
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:37,952
and I wanted to kill him.

1057
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:39,756
I felt like such an
idiotstanding there having them

1058
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,869
seeing me working as a waiter.

1059
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,740
Come on, Joe.

1060
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,870
It's what you do.

1061
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:45,220
It's not what I do.

1062
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:46,787
OK, it's not what you do.

1063
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:48,112
But it's how you pay the rent.

1064
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:48,920
Huh?

1065
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,530
And there's nothing
wrong with it.

1066
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,855
I mean, everybody has to work.

1067
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:52,987
Well, I'm sick of this shit.

1068
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:55,448
I feel like my
life's going nowhere.

1069
00:45:55,578 --> 00:45:58,146
Joe, your life
is going somewhere.

1070
00:45:58,277 --> 00:46:01,541
I mean, you did this
greataudition for Dee Dee Taylor.

1071
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:04,500
She immediately got
you a job with pay.

1072
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:05,651
Did you ever get
through to Madonna?

1073
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:06,720
No.

1074
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:07,677
No, I've been calling all day.

1075
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:09,027
It's the story of my life.

1076
00:46:09,157 --> 00:46:10,157
Nobody's home.

1077
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,899
Oh.

1078
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,380
Come on, Joe.

1079
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:18,166
You just... you just gottastick with it,
you know?

1080
00:46:18,297 --> 00:46:19,777
I mean, you're a great actor.

1081
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:25,652
I know you're going to make it.

1082
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,393
Do you really think so?

1083
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:28,523
I have no doubt.

1084
00:46:31,136 --> 00:46:33,094
OK.

1085
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:35,096
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

1086
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:36,227
Me too, Joe.

1087
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:44,540
Mm.

1088
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:46,412
You feel like fooling around?

1089
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:47,587
I don't know.

1090
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:49,371
I'm not really in the mood.

1091
00:46:49,502 --> 00:46:51,983
Come on, let's do it.

1092
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:53,308
I've got kind of
a big day tomorrow.

1093
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:55,638
I don't want to go
in looking too tired.

1094
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:57,249
Come on.

1095
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:58,819
We're not building
the pyramids here.

1096
00:47:02,994 --> 00:47:04,386
I won't wear you out. I promise.

1097
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:05,517
Come on.

1098
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:06,606
I'm serious.

1099
00:47:06,736 --> 00:47:07,736
Come on, stop!

1100
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:11,393
Jesus.

1101
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:12,631
You don't have to get all pissy.

1102
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:13,700
I'm not getting all pissy.

1103
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,182
I'm just not in the mood.

1104
00:47:17,312 --> 00:47:19,358
OK, fine.

1105
00:47:19,488 --> 00:47:21,403
Men aren't machines
that you can turn off

1106
00:47:21,534 --> 00:47:23,492
and on by the flick
of a switch, you know?

1107
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:24,667
I get the point, Joe.

1108
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:30,978
Now you're angry?

1109
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:32,632
I'm not angry.

1110
00:47:32,762 --> 00:47:35,113
Just next time I'm not inthe mood,
don't give me

1111
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:36,331
any shit, OK?

1112
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:20,767
More champagne, Dirk?

1113
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:26,904
I'm leaving, Deanna.

1114
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:28,166
Oh, please.

1115
00:48:28,296 --> 00:48:29,515
Please, don't leave me.

1116
00:48:29,645 --> 00:48:30,951
I love you, Dirk.

1117
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:32,082
I love you.

1118
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:34,433
That means nothing to me now.

1119
00:48:34,563 --> 00:48:36,609
But you said you loved me.

1120
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:38,524
I don't love you, Deanna.

1121
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:40,265
You're weak.

1122
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:41,831
You're helpless.

1123
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:44,051
And frankly, you bore me.

1124
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:45,661
Please don't.

1125
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:48,186
What do you want me to do?

1126
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:49,596
I want you to
get out of my life.

1127
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,499
Cut!

1128
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:58,500
What's next, Cis?

1129
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:01,851
In 11-A, Deanna
attempts suicide again.

1130
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,288
10 minutes.

1131
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:04,463
Whoa.

1132
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:05,593
Forgive me, father.

1133
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:06,856
Hey, Bob.

1134
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:07,727
Hold up there, wonder muffin.

1135
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:08,597
Hey.

1136
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:09,772
What's up, Roy?

1137
00:49:09,903 --> 00:49:12,253
Ratings are up another five.

1138
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:13,839
Well, you guys should
give me another raise.

1139
00:49:13,863 --> 00:49:14,603
Whoa!

1140
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:16,257
Ow.

1141
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:19,043
Actually,
we've got anentirely new contract for you,

1142
00:49:19,173 --> 00:49:20,000
Bob.

1143
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:22,785
Five years exclusive
with Dirk Drake

1144
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:25,266
having his own A
level story line,

1145
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:29,705
20 minutes guaranteed
screen time per episode.

1146
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:31,272
Script approval?

1147
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:32,403
That's a tall order, Bob.

1148
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:39,977
When you're on your knees,
Roy, everything looks tall.

1149
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:41,107
Remember that.

1150
00:49:45,765 --> 00:49:46,765
Dirk Drake.

1151
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:58,821
What a piece of
shit this script is.

1152
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:02,129
I can't believe I spent
threeyears at the Royal Academy

1153
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,045
just so I could spew
this fucking garbage!

1154
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:05,959
I'm a little busy, baby.

1155
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,570
Do you mind?

1156
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:10,833
What are you doing?

1157
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:13,662
I'm working on my next scene.

1158
00:50:13,793 --> 00:50:15,316
Oh, I see.

1159
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:17,425
You're preparing
usingStanislavsky's famous horoscope

1160
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:18,537
method.

1161
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:20,799
And what's so funny?

1162
00:50:20,843 --> 00:50:21,888
You.

1163
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,194
Oh, come on, muffin.

1164
00:50:23,324 --> 00:50:24,978
Take off your robe.

1165
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:26,109
No.

1166
00:50:26,197 --> 00:50:27,807
What?

1167
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:29,983
You defy me, Deanna?

1168
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:31,289
I'll see you tonight, baby.

1169
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:32,986
Oh, but I'm ready right now.

1170
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:33,856
See?

1171
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:35,162
Yes, you are.

1172
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:37,251
You hold on to that
little monster.

1173
00:50:37,382 --> 00:50:38,209
Not too tightly.

1174
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:39,619
Remember what
happened last time.

1175
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:45,477
That was aonce-in-a-lifetime thing.

1176
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:46,607
I know it was, baby.

1177
00:51:03,669 --> 00:51:04,844
Come on, man!

1178
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,294
Get the hell on
the set, will you?

1179
00:51:06,324 --> 00:51:08,065
Yo, Nicky!

1180
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:08,848
Nick, I got the beach boys.

1181
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:09,805
We're ready.

1182
00:51:09,936 --> 00:51:11,024
Whenever you are, baby.

1183
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:11,894
All right, guys.

1184
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:13,548
Settle down.

1185
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:14,419
All right.

1186
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:15,420
Get quiet on the set, please.

1187
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,290
Thank you.

1188
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:17,726
All right, beach boys.

1189
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:19,337
Settle down and listen up!

1190
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:21,208
Hey, guys, here's
the shot, all right?

1191
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:24,820
Now, Madonna is
going to come walking

1192
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:26,213
up the center aisle, right?

1193
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:28,563
As she passes you
and you see her,

1194
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:31,349
you give a double-take,
allright, like, oh, Madonna.

1195
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:32,599
Whoa, Madonna. - No, no, no.

1196
00:51:32,698 --> 00:51:34,023
No, I mean, don't
say that, but that's

1197
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:35,527
what you're acting like, right? OK.

1198
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:38,356
Now, first of all,
you guys on this side

1199
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:39,637
got to angle this
way, all right?

1200
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:41,402
Yeah, stand over
his way, fellas.

1201
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:42,945
You guys over here,
anglethis way, all right?

1202
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:44,164
You want to angle
this way a little bit.

1203
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,189
Thank you. OK.

1204
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,713
So she walks by,
and make it big.

1205
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:49,367
Big double-take, all right?

1206
00:51:49,497 --> 00:51:50,542
Call rehearsal.

1207
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:52,544
Rehearsal!

1208
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:54,459
OK, ready and action.

1209
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:56,113
And row 1.

1210
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:57,636
Row 2.

1211
00:51:57,766 --> 00:51:58,767
Row 3.

1212
00:51:58,898 --> 00:52:00,029
And 4.

1213
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
And 5.

1214
00:52:01,248 --> 00:52:02,815
And the top.

1215
00:52:02,945 --> 00:52:04,121
Yeah, great. Great.

1216
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:05,402
Guys in the top,
that was excellent.

1217
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:06,751
- Good job, brothers.
- All right...

1218
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:07,559
- Good job, bro!
- Good.

1219
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:09,256
Thanks.

1220
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:10,755
That's the way we're goingto do it,
exactly like that.

1221
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:12,172
Only bigger.

1222
00:52:12,303 --> 00:52:13,932
Hey, man,
make sureyou get a shot of my ass.

1223
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,567
I've been working
on it all week.

1224
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:18,483
Actually, he's right.

1225
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:19,764
Make sure all the
guys in the front row

1226
00:52:19,788 --> 00:52:21,486
have the right kind of, uh...

1227
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:22,748
What?

1228
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:24,576
The right kind of ass, right?

1229
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:25,706
You know what I'm saying?

1230
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:26,791
Can you take care of that?

1231
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:27,883
All right, beach boys.

1232
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:29,014
Turn around!

1233
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:43,334
Bring the lights closer.

1234
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:44,335
Lights.

1235
00:52:44,465 --> 00:52:45,205
Romantic.

1236
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:47,120
I want it very romantic.

1237
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:48,315
Sahara... Sahara, let's go.

1238
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:49,339
Let's go.

1239
00:52:51,864 --> 00:52:53,648
Where is she?

1240
00:52:53,779 --> 00:52:55,084
I don't know where.

1241
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:56,695
Did she call?

1242
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:57,846
Is anybody listening to me?

1243
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,132
Did Sahara call?

1244
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,612
No.

1245
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:01,613
That's it.

1246
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:02,788
I am angry.

1247
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:06,748
I am very, very angry.

1248
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:08,924
Kiki.

1249
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:10,622
Kiki!

1250
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:12,232
Yes, yes.

1251
00:53:12,363 --> 00:53:15,540
Darling, are you afraid of dogs?

1252
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,281
No.

1253
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:19,848
Excellent.

1254
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:21,850
Bring in the poodle!

1255
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:22,503
Poodle!

1256
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:23,678
There.

1257
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:24,809
There.

1258
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:31,860
Some things are dark.

1259
00:53:31,991 --> 00:53:35,124
Some things are red.

1260
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:37,388
Light up that cigar, baby.

1261
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:41,348
And use your imagination.

1262
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:52,316
This is Bob Lattimer.

1263
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:53,446
Leave a message.

1264
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:57,408
Hi, it's me.

1265
00:53:57,538 --> 00:53:59,584
Listen, I was thinking
about our fight.

1266
00:53:59,714 --> 00:54:03,718
And I know that you feel
bad, and I feel bad.

1267
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:05,566
So I just wanted to
call and tell you that I

1268
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,245
think we can work this out.

1269
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:11,900
If I said anything to
upset you, I'm sorry.

1270
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:15,164
Really, I apologize.

1271
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,297
As the crab princess
saidin "The Little Mermaid,"

1272
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:18,864
I wuv you.

1273
00:54:18,994 --> 00:54:20,387
And I want to see you.

1274
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:21,780
So please call me.

1275
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,487
Come on.

1276
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:34,978
I'm not waiting
any fucking longer.

1277
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,379
Let's go. Zee, help me out here, will you?

1278
00:54:36,403 --> 00:54:37,143
Man, how you doing?

1279
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,274
I'm ready.

1280
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:39,145
All right.

1281
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,102
Stop playing house here!

1282
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:41,669
I want quiet!

1283
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,410
Bring in Madonna!

1284
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:45,804
Madonna!

1285
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:54,856
Hey, sweetheart.

1286
00:54:54,987 --> 00:54:55,727
Hey, man.

1287
00:54:55,857 --> 00:54:57,598
Opie, get in the back.

1288
00:54:57,729 --> 00:54:58,749
Go to the back. Come on, man.

1289
00:54:58,773 --> 00:54:59,513
You right there.

1290
00:54:59,644 --> 00:55:00,384
Come here.

1291
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:01,298
Stand in this spot.

1292
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:02,908
Why do I have to go in the back?

1293
00:55:03,038 --> 00:55:03,778
Why?

1294
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,476
Yeah.

1295
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:07,739
Because your ass looks
likea back with a line in it.

1296
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:10,132
Go to the back, or
get off the set.

1297
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:11,003
Come on, man.

1298
00:55:11,133 --> 00:55:12,570
Move it.

1299
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,701
Shit.

1300
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:15,244
Questioning what I was doing.- Let's go.

1301
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:16,419
All right, we're
going to do this.

1302
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:18,053
Don't forget to make it big.

1303
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:19,403
Real but big.

1304
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:20,882
All right, call it, Zee.

1305
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:22,319
All right, umbrellas!

1306
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:23,449
Play back!

1307
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:26,148
Roll those cameras!

1308
00:55:26,279 --> 00:55:27,889
Louder, louder.

1309
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,108
Up, up, come on!

1310
00:55:29,238 --> 00:55:29,978
Yeah!

1311
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:31,109
Action!

1312
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:38,422
Some girls they like candy.

1313
00:55:38,552 --> 00:55:41,686
Others, they like gripe.

1314
00:55:41,816 --> 00:55:46,995
I'll settle for the back of yourhand
somewhere on my behind.

1315
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:49,737
Treat me like I'm a bad girl.

1316
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:52,566
Even when I'm being good to you.

1317
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:54,438
I don't want you to thank me.

1318
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:57,963
You can just... whoo!

1319
00:55:58,093 --> 00:56:00,792
Some guys like to sweet talk.

1320
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:03,447
And others, they like to tease.

1321
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:05,076
OK, cut, cut, cut,
cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

1322
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,537
Come on!

1323
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,495
All right, guys, what the fuck, huh?

1324
00:56:08,626 --> 00:56:09,757
That's a cut!

1325
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:10,628
What do I...

1326
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:12,847
What... that was bigger?

1327
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:14,538
You, you're so concerned
about your ass.

1328
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:16,547
I'd be concerned about
your acting, all right?

1329
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:18,418
Tell the guy in
the blue Speedo...

1330
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:20,159
Get in the fucking
back right now.

1331
00:56:24,772 --> 00:56:25,947
Hey, Bob.

1332
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:27,427
It's Joe.

1333
00:56:27,558 --> 00:56:29,013
I know you're probably
in bed shooting heroin

1334
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:30,430
with some underwear model.

1335
00:56:30,561 --> 00:56:32,921
But if you want to have a beeror something,
give me a call.

1336
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:35,914
Hi, it's me.

1337
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:38,090
Listen, I was thinking
about our fight.

1338
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,659
And I know you feel
bad, and I feel bad.

1339
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,096
Hey.

1340
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:47,839
Are we doing this or not?

1341
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:49,928
You bet your ass we're doing it.

1342
00:56:50,058 --> 00:56:51,582
Are you sure?

1343
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:55,020
Maybe you want to
read your mail next.

1344
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:58,415
Deanna, beware the
wrath of Dirk Drake.

1345
00:57:01,026 --> 00:57:01,766
Look out.

1346
00:57:01,896 --> 00:57:04,246
Here I come.

1347
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:06,684
All right,
now what'swith the crane, huh?

1348
00:57:06,814 --> 00:57:08,454
Zee, why isn't
the crane back to one?

1349
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,186
Move the goddamn craneback to one,
all right?

1350
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,081
All right, let's go.

1351
00:57:13,212 --> 00:57:16,258
You know, Biff,
sometimes Ijust want to rip my clothes off

1352
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:19,218
in the middle of the
set, beat the fucking

1353
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:22,961
shit out of that asshole
assistant director.

1354
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:25,659
I mean, I can outbox, outrun,
and outkick his fucking ass.

1355
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:27,289
And still I have to
take orders from all

1356
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:28,575
these stupid sons of bitches!

1357
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:31,926
I can't fucking
stand it no more.

1358
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:33,275
Fuck!

1359
00:58:01,216 --> 00:58:02,522
Excuse me, Madonna?

1360
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:08,659
Joe Finnegan.

1361
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,138
You called me.

1362
00:58:10,269 --> 00:58:12,029
I tried calling you rightback,
but there was no answer

1363
00:58:12,053 --> 00:58:13,053
at the number you left.

1364
00:58:17,232 --> 00:58:20,061
You reallythought I was her, didn't you?

1365
00:58:20,192 --> 00:58:20,888
Oh, my god.

1366
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:21,802
You look just like her.

1367
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:22,673
I know.

1368
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:23,848
I know.

1369
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:26,198
I've done her body work
for the last two videos.

1370
00:58:26,328 --> 00:58:27,852
Really?

1371
00:58:27,982 --> 00:58:29,854
And what I really want
to do is get a contract

1372
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:32,378
so I can be in all her videos,
and maybe even her movies,

1373
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,120
especially now, since the baby.

1374
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,556
So where is she?

1375
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:38,166
She did all the
close-ups yesterday.

1376
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:40,473
She's probably back
in LA and Miami.

1377
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:42,519
You know, she spends
a lot of time there.

1378
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:43,868
But you know her, right?

1379
00:58:43,998 --> 00:58:45,043
And kick.

1380
00:58:45,173 --> 00:58:46,218
Kick.

1381
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:48,133
And punch, and gouge.

1382
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:49,308
And kick.

1383
00:58:49,438 --> 00:58:51,571
OK, position alpha.

1384
00:58:51,702 --> 00:58:53,747
I want to show you now
what to do in the event

1385
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:55,198
that you are
attacked from behind.

1386
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:57,229
This is very important, OK?

1387
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,449
Anyone want to volunteer?

1388
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,320
Mary?

1389
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,845
OK, now get behind me.

1390
00:59:04,976 --> 00:59:06,934
OK, now, I want you
to wrap your arms

1391
00:59:07,065 --> 00:59:09,676
around me as if you're goingto
attack me from behind, OK?

1392
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:12,418
Go ahead.

1393
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,527
My hands are free,
but it'sgoing to be hard to pull

1394
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,378
these arms off, all right?

1395
00:59:16,509 --> 00:59:18,729
What's the next closest weapon?

1396
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:20,992
Teeth, right?

1397
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:24,038
But at the same time,
bring up that right leg,

1398
00:59:24,169 --> 00:59:26,258
and deliver a heel
smash to the instep.

1399
00:59:26,388 --> 00:59:29,217
So it's... ah, right?

1400
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:32,786
That heel smash will open upthis leg,
OK, and creating

1401
00:59:32,917 --> 00:59:35,659
the space here in
which I will deliver

1402
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:38,009
an elbow to the stomach, OK?

1403
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:43,362
Now, why don't youassume that position, OK?

1404
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:45,538
Now, I'm going to grab you here.

1405
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:48,846
Now, give me the bite.

1406
00:59:48,976 --> 00:59:50,195
OK.

1407
00:59:50,325 --> 00:59:53,415
And then the heel smash.

1408
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:54,808
OK.

1409
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:55,809
That's going to open
me up a little bit.

1410
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,332
And you're going
to give me that...

1411
00:59:57,463 --> 00:59:58,203
Very good.

1412
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,466
OK, try it again.

1413
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,077
OK.

1414
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:04,035
All right.

1415
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:05,165
It's exciting.

1416
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:05,950
Yeah.

1417
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,255
Yeah, that's... that's great.

1418
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:08,822
Yeah. Excuse me.

1419
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:09,973
- Very good.
- Thanks a lot.

1420
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:10,737
Very good.

1421
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:11,975
All right, I'll talk to you.

1422
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:12,999
OK.

1423
01:00:16,308 --> 01:00:17,918
Yeah, but what
about AIDS, man?

1424
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:20,051
AIDS was created
in a laboratory

1425
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:21,879
by white Jewish scientists.

1426
01:00:22,009 --> 01:00:24,142
It was a conspiracy
with the FBI,

1427
01:00:24,272 --> 01:00:28,799
basically,
to annihilate thepower of the black nation.

1428
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:30,627
This is going to blow your mind.

1429
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:33,107
You know the Holocaust?

1430
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:34,238
Never happened.

1431
01:00:34,282 --> 01:00:36,110
Oh, man.

1432
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:38,286
What about all thestories and the pictures?

1433
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:39,679
That shit is fake.

1434
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,899
About as real as your hair.

1435
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:43,640
Come on, look at this shit.

1436
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,165
I read a book, page
after page of proof

1437
01:00:47,295 --> 01:00:49,384
that said that the Jewsmade
the whole Holocaust up.

1438
01:00:49,515 --> 01:00:50,864
Shit never happened.

1439
01:00:50,995 --> 01:00:53,040
Hey, you know, I think
I read that same book.

1440
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:55,303
You remember the
partabout slavery in America?

1441
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:57,566
What part is that?

1442
01:00:57,697 --> 01:00:59,960
Where the guy proves
thatall the African-Americans

1443
01:01:00,091 --> 01:01:02,920
who came here in the
1600sactually wanted to come.

1444
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:05,357
In fact, most of them
paid their own way.

1445
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:07,881
What the fuck are
you talking about, man?

1446
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:09,404
No, it's true.

1447
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:11,121
They heard there were lots
ofjobs over here picking cotton,

1448
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:12,775
which they figured would
lead to better jobs,

1449
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,627
as muggers and crackheads, so they just all

1450
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:15,758
came rushing over here.

1451
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:16,977
Can you believe it?

1452
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:18,544
Slavery never existed.

1453
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:24,681
And this shit is not
even a little bit funny.

1454
01:01:24,811 --> 01:01:26,211
Well, it's at least
as funny as what

1455
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,989
you said about theHolocaust,
don't you think?

1456
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,644
How's this for funny, beach boy?

1457
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,535
Why don't you get
yourpail and get out of here?

1458
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:34,559
You're fucking fired.

1459
01:01:39,043 --> 01:01:40,827
All right,
everyone, back to work.

1460
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:41,698
I want silence.

1461
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:43,700
Don't play with me today, guys.

1462
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:45,005
Just bear with me.

1463
01:01:51,316 --> 01:01:52,056
Just give me a minute.

1464
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:55,320
I told you it was the rubber!

1465
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,757
The rubber's off now.

1466
01:01:57,888 --> 01:02:00,499
Damn right the rubber's off.

1467
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:01,629
Well?

1468
01:02:05,156 --> 01:02:06,200
Hold on.

1469
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:07,651
What do you think
I am, a machine?

1470
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:14,731
Hey, what are you doing?

1471
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:15,949
Come on, Kelly.

1472
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,516
Get back here.

1473
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:19,257
Get back in the bed.

1474
01:02:19,387 --> 01:02:23,174
Listen, baby,
I know thesethings happen sometimes.

1475
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:24,044
But I got to know.

1476
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:25,959
Can you do this or not?

1477
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:27,807
Because if you can't, I
gotta get on the phone,

1478
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:32,009
make some calls, and
find somebody who can.

1479
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:33,924
Oh, what's the matter, baby?

1480
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:35,926
I hurt you feelings?

1481
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:39,103
Actually, Kelly, you
did hurt my feelings.

1482
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:40,234
Christ.

1483
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:42,280
I mean, I like you, right?

1484
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,605
You're making me
feel like I'm just

1485
01:02:43,629 --> 01:02:44,978
a stiff piece of meat to you.

1486
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:45,936
Mm.

1487
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:49,461
Well, not so stiff,
really, right?

1488
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:51,506
Just get the hell out of here.

1489
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:55,075
You think I want to do
thisnow after what you just said?

1490
01:02:55,206 --> 01:02:58,296
You can't do it.

1491
01:02:58,426 --> 01:02:59,210
Get on the bed.

1492
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,603
No!

1493
01:03:01,734 --> 01:03:02,953
What are you... oh, shit!

1494
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,083
Ah!

1495
01:03:12,484 --> 01:03:13,659
See you on set, Dirk.

1496
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:22,886
So anybody need a ride?

1497
01:03:23,016 --> 01:03:24,080
I'm heading downtown.
- No thanks.

1498
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:24,713
Oh, um...

1499
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:25,932
Where are you going, Mary?

1500
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:26,454
I'm actually... I'm
going downtown.

1501
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:27,673
Great.

1502
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,501
Anybody else need
a ride downtown?

1503
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:30,631
OK.

1504
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:36,334
It's a big car, ladies.

1505
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:37,464
No takers?

1506
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:47,388
All right.

1507
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:50,391
There you go.

1508
01:03:50,522 --> 01:03:51,522
Oh, thank you.

1509
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:03,274
God damn it.

1510
01:04:03,404 --> 01:04:04,404
Mary?

1511
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:10,542
Mary?

1512
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:12,674
Where is she?

1513
01:04:12,805 --> 01:04:15,155
You know, Mary, I got
to say, of all the women

1514
01:04:15,286 --> 01:04:17,331
who have passed throughmy
classes over the years,

1515
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:21,292
you're by far the
mostcourageous and committed.

1516
01:04:21,422 --> 01:04:22,554
Thanks, Doug.

1517
01:04:22,684 --> 01:04:24,208
You're, uh... you're
a great teacher.

1518
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:27,428
And everybody says so.

1519
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:30,431
Well, yes and no.

1520
01:04:30,562 --> 01:04:34,000
I mean, you know,
I mean ateacher can only do so much.

1521
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:37,993
What does your boyfriend do?

1522
01:04:41,486 --> 01:04:42,661
Oh, my god!

1523
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:49,319
Jesus Christ.

1524
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:54,629
I'm leaving, Deanna.

1525
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,760
Oh, please.

1526
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:57,110
Please don't leave me.

1527
01:04:57,241 --> 01:04:58,590
I love you, Dirk.

1528
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,720
I love you.

1529
01:04:59,808 --> 01:05:02,594
That means nothing to me now.

1530
01:05:02,724 --> 01:05:04,335
You said you loved me.

1531
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:06,206
I don't love you, Deanna.

1532
01:05:06,337 --> 01:05:07,077
You're weak.

1533
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,426
You're helpless.

1534
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:10,428
And frankly, you're boring.

1535
01:05:10,558 --> 01:05:12,647
Oh, please Dirk.

1536
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:15,128
What do you want me to do?

1537
01:05:15,259 --> 01:05:17,652
I want you to
get out of my life.

1538
01:05:17,783 --> 01:05:21,091
Well, what's she
gonna do now, huh?

1539
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:23,789
Try suicide again?

1540
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,791
Hmm.

1541
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:50,207
Look at Bob on the TV.

1542
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:53,558
Wow, it is Bob.

1543
01:05:53,688 --> 01:05:57,127
Look at that.

1544
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:58,626
How long have you
guys been together?

1545
01:05:58,650 --> 01:05:59,433
Six years.

1546
01:05:59,564 --> 01:06:00,826
Jump back.

1547
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,306
Wow.

1548
01:06:02,436 --> 01:06:04,656
Like a real married couple here.

1549
01:06:04,786 --> 01:06:05,526
Wow.

1550
01:06:05,657 --> 01:06:07,354
Ah, No.

1551
01:06:07,485 --> 01:06:10,357
I don't think either one of
usis very interested in marriage.

1552
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:12,316
You know something?

1553
01:06:12,446 --> 01:06:14,057
Your boyfriend is a
very, very lucky guy.

1554
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:18,495
Thank you.

1555
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:31,117
Mary.

1556
01:06:31,248 --> 01:06:32,248
Wait, Mary.

1557
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,003
Baby, what's the matter?

1558
01:06:51,311 --> 01:06:52,573
Can I come in?

1559
01:06:52,704 --> 01:06:54,184
Of course.

1560
01:06:54,314 --> 01:06:55,314
Of course.

1561
01:06:58,188 --> 01:06:59,972
Um, what... what's going on?

1562
01:07:03,671 --> 01:07:04,977
What... what is it?

1563
01:07:10,461 --> 01:07:11,461
I've been thinking a lot.

1564
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:16,133
I feel it's important
to tell you.

1565
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,560
What?

1566
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:23,909
Tell... tell me what?

1567
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,520
Look, I know I've been...

1568
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:27,391
No, Bob.

1569
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:29,523
No, you haven't.

1570
01:07:29,654 --> 01:07:30,654
Yes, I have.

1571
01:07:30,742 --> 01:07:33,527
I have, all right.

1572
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:34,658
And I feel...

1573
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:40,665
I feel...

1574
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:41,840
What?

1575
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:42,970
What do you feel?

1576
01:07:47,585 --> 01:07:48,586
What, baby?

1577
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:49,716
Oh.

1578
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:53,372
Ohh.

1579
01:07:57,377 --> 01:07:58,377
Ohh.

1580
01:08:00,206 --> 01:08:02,774
Oh, it's OK.

1581
01:08:02,904 --> 01:08:03,514
Did they pay you?

1582
01:08:03,644 --> 01:08:04,950
No.

1583
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,560
But for me, it was worth it.

1584
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:07,474
Oh, that's great, Joe.

1585
01:08:07,605 --> 01:08:08,605
That's great.

1586
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:11,217
You get your first
paying acting job ever,

1587
01:08:11,348 --> 01:08:13,915
and you blow it all bymaking
some stupid comment.

1588
01:08:14,046 --> 01:08:15,569
That sounds worth it.

1589
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,020
I don't want to
sound funny, Mary.

1590
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,531
But a lecture is the
lastthing that I need right now.

1591
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:21,923
Hey, Joe.

1592
01:08:22,054 --> 01:08:24,448
Do you think just once,
you could lift the toilet

1593
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:25,927
seat when you take a leak?

1594
01:08:26,058 --> 01:08:28,104
What do you mean, just once?

1595
01:08:28,234 --> 01:08:29,322
I always lift it.

1596
01:08:29,453 --> 01:08:30,584
You never do it.

1597
01:08:30,715 --> 01:08:31,455
Come here, look at this.

1598
01:08:31,585 --> 01:08:32,825
There's piss all over the seat.

1599
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:34,110
There is not.

1600
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,720
Come look.

1601
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,654
I'm not going to go in
there and look at a drop

1602
01:08:37,678 --> 01:08:38,984
of piss on a toilet seat.

1603
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,246
You admit it.

1604
01:08:40,377 --> 01:08:41,465
I do not.

1605
01:08:41,595 --> 01:08:42,635
Would you get off my case?

1606
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:44,076
What's the matter with you?

1607
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:46,513
I'm not on your case.

1608
01:08:46,644 --> 01:08:48,084
You're just in a
bad mood because you

1609
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:49,386
know you did something stupid.

1610
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:57,002
What?

1611
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,178
You're going to bed?

1612
01:08:59,309 --> 01:09:00,048
Well.

1613
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:01,006
It appears that way.

1614
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,181
Why?

1615
01:09:02,312 --> 01:09:03,506
Is there something on your mind?

1616
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,050
Well, it just struck
me that we haven't

1617
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:06,794
made love for over a month.

1618
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:09,101
Well, it's not my fault.

1619
01:09:09,232 --> 01:09:11,321
Well, it's not my fault.

1620
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:13,584
Joe, you have been
very depressed lately.

1621
01:09:13,714 --> 01:09:15,194
No, I haven't.

1622
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:17,085
You just told me
yesterdayyou felt like your life

1623
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:18,284
was going nowhere.

1624
01:09:18,415 --> 01:09:19,633
So?

1625
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:22,984
I can feel that way
and not be depressed.

1626
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:25,161
Well,
it's very hard onme dealing with your moods

1627
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:26,292
all the time.

1628
01:09:26,423 --> 01:09:27,704
Well, it's very hard
on me having to wear

1629
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:28,990
the rubber all the time.

1630
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:31,036
It's not all the time.

1631
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,820
It certainly seems like it.

1632
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:34,344
Fine. We won't use it.

1633
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:35,258
I'll just get pregnant.

1634
01:09:35,388 --> 01:09:36,433
Is that what you want?

1635
01:09:36,563 --> 01:09:39,131
Why is it that every time I say

1636
01:09:39,262 --> 01:09:41,394
I don't want to use a
rubber, you accuse me

1637
01:09:41,525 --> 01:09:43,353
of wanting to get you pregnant?

1638
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:45,268
You said you wanted
to have a baby.

1639
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:46,617
Not right now.

1640
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:48,184
When?

1641
01:09:48,314 --> 01:09:50,838
Look,
let's just stopthis discussion right now.

1642
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:51,796
I'm in a bad mood.

1643
01:09:51,926 --> 01:09:52,927
You're in a bad mood.

1644
01:09:53,058 --> 01:09:54,190
We're stopping.

1645
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,496
I've stopped.

1646
01:09:56,627 --> 01:09:59,027
You make some money,
and maybewe'll talk about having a kid.

1647
01:10:03,024 --> 01:10:06,027
Why does it always have
tocome down to money with you?

1648
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:07,638
Because you don't have any.

1649
01:10:07,768 --> 01:10:09,335
And let's face it, Joe.

1650
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:10,704
I know you're trying
to make it as an actor.

1651
01:10:10,728 --> 01:10:12,991
But you work as a waiter.

1652
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:14,481
You still don't
even have an agent.

1653
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:16,212
I know I don't have an agent.

1654
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:17,462
You think I don't know that?

1655
01:10:17,517 --> 01:10:18,953
Don't yell at me.

1656
01:10:19,084 --> 01:10:21,608
Well,
don't talk to melike I'm a fucking idiot!

1657
01:10:21,739 --> 01:10:23,915
You think I like being
broke all the time?

1658
01:10:24,045 --> 01:10:26,047
You think I like wearing
that cheap tuxedo,

1659
01:10:26,178 --> 01:10:28,746
serving up salmon and
greasy cheesy sauce?

1660
01:10:28,876 --> 01:10:31,009
You think I like kissing
Dee Dee Taylor's ass

1661
01:10:31,139 --> 01:10:34,186
so she can get me a job
standingaround in my bathing suit,

1662
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:36,580
which you bought?

1663
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:39,104
How do you think that
makes me feel, huh?

1664
01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:44,240
Joe, I'm sorry, OK?

1665
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:45,110
I'm sorry.

1666
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:45,980
I didn't mean it.

1667
01:10:46,111 --> 01:10:47,504
OK?

1668
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:49,680
Come here.

1669
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,203
No.

1670
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:54,989
I know how hard
it is on you, Joe.

1671
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,600
But it's hard on me too.

1672
01:10:56,730 --> 01:11:00,125
I feel like everything's
on my shoulders.

1673
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,823
I feel like I'm all alone.

1674
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:05,739
I know.

1675
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,270
I've got to ask
Ernst for more work.

1676
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,390
That's all there is to it.

1677
01:11:10,788 --> 01:11:13,094
I've got to find some wayto
make some more money.

1678
01:11:13,225 --> 01:11:14,357
Joe, come here.

1679
01:11:23,714 --> 01:11:26,760
Joe, I love you whetheryou
have money or not, OK?

1680
01:11:26,891 --> 01:11:28,893
I don't want to argue with you.

1681
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:32,462
I came home tonight,
and Ireally wanted to see you.

1682
01:11:32,592 --> 01:11:34,551
You go out and have
a drink after class?

1683
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:36,422
No, class went a
little later tonight.

1684
01:11:36,553 --> 01:11:37,953
And I hopped in a
cab and came home.

1685
01:11:40,992 --> 01:11:43,342
You took a cab?

1686
01:11:43,473 --> 01:11:45,997
Yeah, I just wanted to get home.

1687
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:47,127
That makes sense.

1688
01:12:18,638 --> 01:12:20,118
Hey, Mary, look at this.

1689
01:12:20,248 --> 01:12:21,554
Look at this woman's underwear.

1690
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:24,470
See how it's all sleek andlacy,
how it accentuates

1691
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:25,926
every part of her
body and presents it

1692
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,431
like a beautiful piece of candy?

1693
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:29,432
What's the matter? - Nothing.

1694
01:12:29,562 --> 01:12:30,694
I'm just listening.

1695
01:12:30,824 --> 01:12:32,384
Well, you got a funny
look on your face.

1696
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:34,326
Joe,
I'm just waitingfor you to make your point.

1697
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,590
Well, my point is, compare that

1698
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,178
to men's underwear,
which is white,

1699
01:12:37,309 --> 01:12:40,051
cotton, shapeless,
essentially a diaper.

1700
01:12:40,181 --> 01:12:41,705
What do you think that's saying?

1701
01:12:41,835 --> 01:12:43,663
All men are babies?

1702
01:12:43,794 --> 01:12:44,988
I'm trying to be
serious here, Mary.

1703
01:12:45,012 --> 01:12:46,492
I think this is an
important statement

1704
01:12:46,623 --> 01:12:48,383
about the relationship
between men and women.

1705
01:12:48,407 --> 01:12:49,669
Good.

1706
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,627
I think you should
write a book about it.

1707
01:12:50,757 --> 01:12:52,256
And then maybe you
can tour the country

1708
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,978
lecturing the lingerie stores.

1709
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:54,848
Thanks a lot, Mary.

1710
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,807
That's very funny.

1711
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:58,678
I still need the rent.

1712
01:12:58,809 --> 01:13:00,854
I'm picking my check
up from Ernst today.

1713
01:13:00,985 --> 01:13:02,385
I might be a little
bit late tonight

1714
01:13:02,421 --> 01:13:04,336
because I've got an audition.

1715
01:13:04,467 --> 01:13:05,990
For what?

1716
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,295
Some movie.

1717
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:09,428
Dee Dee Taylor called me in.

1718
01:13:09,559 --> 01:13:11,604
Well, good luck.

1719
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:13,175
So I guess we're
still fighting, huh?

1720
01:13:15,739 --> 01:13:16,740
I'm not fighting.

1721
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:17,915
What?

1722
01:13:18,045 --> 01:13:19,045
No kiss goodbye?

1723
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:32,582
I had an abortion.

1724
01:13:32,712 --> 01:13:34,366
So what?

1725
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:36,586
Dirk, how could you be so cruel?

1726
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:38,239
I'm not cruel, Deanna.

1727
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:39,370
I'm honest.

1728
01:13:42,069 --> 01:13:43,636
And I know exactly what you are.

1729
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:45,029
- I want to go.
- No, you don't.

1730
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:45,899
I want...

1731
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:47,074
You want me.

1732
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:50,208
That's what you want.

1733
01:13:50,338 --> 01:13:51,644
Cut! Cut!

1734
01:13:51,775 --> 01:13:52,515
Cut!

1735
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:55,779
Bob, it's all about energy, man.

1736
01:13:55,909 --> 01:13:58,738
When you grab her, I
need to see energy.

1737
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:01,001
What the fuck do you mean?

1738
01:14:01,132 --> 01:14:04,135
Cis, be so kind as
totell him what the fuck I mean.

1739
01:14:04,265 --> 01:14:05,963
Louder, Carl?

1740
01:14:06,093 --> 01:14:07,312
Is that what you're saying?

1741
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,966
God fucking dammit.

1742
01:14:09,096 --> 01:14:10,837
I'm coming down.

1743
01:14:10,968 --> 01:14:11,968
God damn it!

1744
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:19,846
This is what I'm talking about.

1745
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:25,243
You grab her, like this.

1746
01:14:25,373 --> 01:14:26,113
Ha!

1747
01:14:26,244 --> 01:14:27,767
She feels it.

1748
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:28,898
You feel it.

1749
01:14:28,942 --> 01:14:29,943
She's turned on.

1750
01:14:30,074 --> 01:14:32,206
She's like a hunted animal.

1751
01:14:32,337 --> 01:14:35,253
Suddenly, you pull
her to you like this.

1752
01:14:35,383 --> 01:14:36,602
Oh, I like that.

1753
01:14:36,733 --> 01:14:37,733
Rip her blouse.

1754
01:14:37,821 --> 01:14:39,170
Wardrobe.

1755
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,086
Let her know that it's sexright now,
whether she wants it

1756
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:44,958
or not.

1757
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:46,351
OK, Shakespeare?

1758
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,482
Go nuts.

1759
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:53,706
And action.

1760
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:55,403
I had an erection.

1761
01:14:58,319 --> 01:14:59,319
I mean abortion.

1762
01:14:59,407 --> 01:15:01,888
Abortion.

1763
01:15:02,019 --> 01:15:02,759
All right, all right.

1764
01:15:02,889 --> 01:15:03,889
Come on, Bob.

1765
01:15:03,934 --> 01:15:04,934
I said action.

1766
01:15:08,765 --> 01:15:10,114
Action!

1767
01:15:10,244 --> 01:15:12,812
What the fuck is wrong with him?

1768
01:15:12,943 --> 01:15:14,945
Oh, bloody Christ.

1769
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:18,818
Bob... Bob.

1770
01:15:18,949 --> 01:15:21,255
I'm off the show, all right?

1771
01:15:21,386 --> 01:15:23,214
No contract, no nothing.

1772
01:15:23,344 --> 01:15:24,084
Party's over.

1773
01:15:24,215 --> 01:15:24,955
That's it.

1774
01:15:25,085 --> 01:15:26,522
Bob, Bob.

1775
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:29,437
Bob, you're making waytoo much out of this,
man.

1776
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:30,351
You just got a little jammed up.

1777
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:31,222
That's all.

1778
01:15:31,352 --> 01:15:32,352
It happens to everybody.

1779
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:33,485
No.

1780
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:35,835
We've got a big,
big problem here.

1781
01:15:35,966 --> 01:15:37,465
And I can tell you
exactly where it is.

1782
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:39,056
All right, it's Carl, right?

1783
01:15:39,186 --> 01:15:40,405
You want a new director?

1784
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,363
No, it is Dirk and Deanna.

1785
01:15:42,494 --> 01:15:44,452
Their story is stalled.

1786
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:46,454
They keep going
in circles, saying

1787
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:48,935
the same things over and over.

1788
01:15:49,066 --> 01:15:50,415
They're not real.

1789
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,417
There's no movement,
no development.

1790
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,548
All right, OK.

1791
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:54,592
You want development?

1792
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,116
No problem. Here we go.

1793
01:15:56,247 --> 01:15:57,378
OK.

1794
01:15:57,509 --> 01:16:01,121
They are... they get married.

1795
01:16:01,252 --> 01:16:02,732
Right?

1796
01:16:02,862 --> 01:16:06,866
So we do the whole
ceremonyand the wedding night...

1797
01:16:06,997 --> 01:16:10,217
Hot tub, baby oil.

1798
01:16:10,348 --> 01:16:11,348
You with me?

1799
01:16:11,436 --> 01:16:12,568
See?

1800
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:14,831
You want development,
you got it.

1801
01:16:14,961 --> 01:16:18,182
You see,
I'd go in exactlythe opposite direction.

1802
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:20,358
Think about this, Roy.

1803
01:16:20,488 --> 01:16:24,971
The next time Deannaattempts suicide,
it works.

1804
01:16:25,102 --> 01:16:30,194
That would be funny.

1805
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:33,371
Christ, she talks
about it enough.

1806
01:16:33,501 --> 01:16:34,590
Every single episode.

1807
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:40,552
She kills herself?

1808
01:16:40,683 --> 01:16:41,683
She kills herself.

1809
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:47,690
She kills herself.

1810
01:16:54,218 --> 01:16:57,656
God, I can't believe
how simple that was.

1811
01:16:57,787 --> 01:16:58,614
Hey.

1812
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:02,356
Hey, good idea, Roy.

1813
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:03,967
Thanks for thinking about it.

1814
01:17:04,097 --> 01:17:05,097
I mean it.

1815
01:17:17,415 --> 01:17:19,460
Kelly.

1816
01:17:19,591 --> 01:17:21,231
All right, what is
the, uh, meter reading?

1817
01:17:21,288 --> 01:17:22,115
Meter's at 11.

1818
01:17:22,246 --> 01:17:23,290
Yeah.

1819
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:25,379
And the, uh, face.

1820
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,686
I want the faces
to look all right.

1821
01:17:27,817 --> 01:17:28,556
Oh, I know.

1822
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:30,254
I can feel it.

1823
01:17:30,384 --> 01:17:31,211
Can you?

1824
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:32,473
Yes, I really can.

1825
01:17:32,604 --> 01:17:35,389
Mary,
it was telling meto just get away and spend

1826
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,610
some quality time with me.

1827
01:17:38,741 --> 01:17:39,916
Oh, your favorite person.

1828
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:41,178
Yeah.

1829
01:17:41,308 --> 01:17:42,875
With myself.

1830
01:17:43,006 --> 01:17:44,964
Yes, yes, yes.

1831
01:17:45,095 --> 01:17:46,681
I told you that I'm a
very spiritual person.

1832
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:48,489
Mm-hmm.

1833
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:52,580
Today my horoscope said
you will look within.

1834
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:56,889
And that which was
lost will be regained.

1835
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:58,499
Oh.

1836
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,501
I've regained something, Mary.

1837
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:02,721
Someone.

1838
01:18:02,852 --> 01:18:03,591
Really?

1839
01:18:03,722 --> 01:18:04,984
Mm-hmm.

1840
01:18:05,115 --> 01:18:07,944
That guy you went
rollerblading with?

1841
01:18:08,074 --> 01:18:09,074
What?

1842
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:11,425
You know, who hit
you with his elbow?

1843
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:12,600
Oh, oh.

1844
01:18:12,731 --> 01:18:14,907
Oh, that was an accident.

1845
01:18:15,038 --> 01:18:17,736
Besides, love is
never perfect, Mary.

1846
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:18,868
I've learned that.

1847
01:18:18,998 --> 01:18:21,522
And I'm a much happier person.

1848
01:18:21,653 --> 01:18:23,916
Sahara, darling,
I needyou out here immediately.

1849
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:26,789
Let me see these.

1850
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:29,487
Who are you going to put there?

1851
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:32,577
Will everyone please be quiet!

1852
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,666
I want absolute quiet
in this room right now.

1853
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:35,797
This is not a game.

1854
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:36,929
We are not playing here.

1855
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:41,238
I'm sorry to be yelling,
but I am very angry.

1856
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:43,066
Not at you, my darlings.

1857
01:18:43,196 --> 01:18:45,416
You are magnificent,
both of you.

1858
01:18:45,546 --> 01:18:48,767
All right, let's shoot.

1859
01:18:48,898 --> 01:18:50,638
All right.

1860
01:18:50,769 --> 01:18:51,769
Yes, yes.

1861
01:18:51,814 --> 01:18:52,814
Love.

1862
01:18:56,514 --> 01:18:58,559
Sensual.

1863
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:00,126
Good, Rubio.

1864
01:19:00,257 --> 01:19:01,258
Almost there.

1865
01:19:01,388 --> 01:19:03,564
And the stomach, stomach.

1866
01:19:03,695 --> 01:19:05,653
Give me those nice,
tight chunky abs.

1867
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:06,524
That's it.

1868
01:19:06,654 --> 01:19:08,308
That's it.

1869
01:19:08,439 --> 01:19:09,614
Good. All right.

1870
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:10,745
Eternity.

1871
01:19:13,836 --> 01:19:15,141
Oh.

1872
01:19:15,272 --> 01:19:17,491
Eternal love.

1873
01:19:17,622 --> 01:19:19,102
Hold on.

1874
01:19:19,232 --> 01:19:20,059
Keep going.

1875
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:22,018
Give me more.

1876
01:19:22,148 --> 01:19:24,281
Give me abs, chunky abs.

1877
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:25,586
Tighter, tighter.

1878
01:19:25,717 --> 01:19:26,717
Tighter.

1879
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,503
Oh, dios.

1880
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:31,288
Rubio, what's the matter?

1881
01:19:31,418 --> 01:19:32,202
Come on...

1882
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:33,072
What is it?

1883
01:19:33,203 --> 01:19:34,291
What happened?

1884
01:19:34,421 --> 01:19:35,858
What's the matter?

1885
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,690
He is deeply, deeply ashamed.

1886
01:19:42,821 --> 01:19:45,147
He has never, ever released
thegas in front of a woman before.

1887
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:45,911
Rubio.

1888
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:47,652
Rubio, it's OK.

1889
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:48,522
It's OK.

1890
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:49,828
I don't mind.

1891
01:19:49,959 --> 01:19:51,090
Come here, baby.

1892
01:19:51,221 --> 01:19:52,048
Come here.

1893
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:55,355
I don't mind.

1894
01:19:55,486 --> 01:19:57,183
Oh, Rubio.

1895
01:19:57,314 --> 01:19:59,011
I love you.

1896
01:19:59,142 --> 01:20:00,142
Rubio, no care.

1897
01:20:00,186 --> 01:20:01,231
No care.

1898
01:20:01,361 --> 01:20:02,710
Do you understand no care?

1899
01:20:02,841 --> 01:20:03,668
No care.

1900
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,670
No care.

1901
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:06,801
Oh.

1902
01:20:06,889 --> 01:20:07,889
Clear.

1903
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:31,696
Mr. Bob.

1904
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:35,265
Clean, press, hang, no box.

1905
01:20:35,395 --> 01:20:36,459
Ah, you're the best, Chang.

1906
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:37,223
I know it.

1907
01:20:37,354 --> 01:20:38,659
Yeah.

1908
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:39,870
I've got something for you.

1909
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:43,708
Oh, no.

1910
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:44,839
My old tuxedo.

1911
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:46,319
Mr. Bob.

1912
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:47,712
Come on.

1913
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,255
I told you I was going
to give it to you.

1914
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:51,194
Just take it, will you?

1915
01:20:51,324 --> 01:20:52,151
Will you sign?

1916
01:20:52,282 --> 01:20:53,326
What?

1917
01:20:53,457 --> 01:20:54,197
Your name.

1918
01:20:54,327 --> 01:20:55,459
Sign your name here.

1919
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:57,940
Chang,
I'm not goingto sign a fucking tuxedo.

1920
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:59,376
Oh, yes, Mr. Bob.

1921
01:20:59,506 --> 01:21:00,551
You will sign.

1922
01:21:00,681 --> 01:21:03,467
Souvenir, remember?

1923
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,559
Hey, Bob!

1924
01:21:08,689 --> 01:21:09,734
Hey! - Hey!

1925
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:10,648
Hey!

1926
01:21:10,778 --> 01:21:12,128
Look at you!

1927
01:21:12,258 --> 01:21:13,085
Look at that!

1928
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,565
Look at all this money.

1929
01:21:14,695 --> 01:21:15,392
How are you, man?

1930
01:21:15,522 --> 01:21:16,262
Oh, great.

1931
01:21:16,393 --> 01:21:17,631
Hey, did you get
my message, man?

1932
01:21:17,655 --> 01:21:19,570
You haven't fucking
called me, you bastard.

1933
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,788
I was going to call you.

1934
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:22,331
But I've been so busy
with this god damn soap.

1935
01:21:22,355 --> 01:21:23,617
Oh, yeah.

1936
01:21:23,748 --> 01:21:24,575
It's going pretty well, huh?

1937
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:25,141
I can't complain.

1938
01:21:25,271 --> 01:21:26,446
Yeah.

1939
01:21:26,577 --> 01:21:27,771
Just signed a five-year
contract today.

1940
01:21:27,795 --> 01:21:28,971
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1941
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:29,841
Five years!

1942
01:21:29,972 --> 01:21:30,711
What about you?

1943
01:21:30,842 --> 01:21:31,669
Still doing the catering?

1944
01:21:31,799 --> 01:21:33,018
Oh, yeah.

1945
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:34,759
Yeah, I'm picking
up my tux right now.

1946
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:40,156
And, uh, check it out.

1947
01:21:40,286 --> 01:21:41,157
What's that?

1948
01:21:41,287 --> 01:21:42,636
I did a Madonna video.

1949
01:21:42,767 --> 01:21:43,767
Yeah.

1950
01:21:43,855 --> 01:21:45,944
She called me at home.

1951
01:21:46,075 --> 01:21:47,356
I tried to call her
back, but I haven't been

1952
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:48,991
able to get through, you know?

1953
01:21:50,818 --> 01:21:52,037
What?

1954
01:21:52,168 --> 01:21:53,299
What, you don't believe me?

1955
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:55,110
Come over to my house.
Come over right now.

1956
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:56,452
Come on, let's go
over to my house.

1957
01:21:56,476 --> 01:21:58,106
I'll play the message
for you. I saved the tape.

1958
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:59,330
Come on. I'll play it for you.

1959
01:21:59,436 --> 01:22:00,437
Hey.

1960
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:02,154
That was this... that
was this chick I know.

1961
01:22:02,178 --> 01:22:04,310
She does a great
Madonna imitation.

1962
01:22:04,441 --> 01:22:06,747
I said, hey, call my buddy, Joe.

1963
01:22:06,878 --> 01:22:07,661
Say you're Madonna.

1964
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:09,315
Leave a fake number.

1965
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:10,926
I didn't think she
was going to do it.

1966
01:22:14,016 --> 01:22:15,060
That was you?

1967
01:22:15,191 --> 01:22:16,583
Yeah.

1968
01:22:16,714 --> 01:22:18,107
Hey, I'm sorry.

1969
01:22:18,237 --> 01:22:19,519
I thought you'd get
a kick out of it.

1970
01:22:19,543 --> 01:22:20,283
I mean that.

1971
01:22:20,413 --> 01:22:21,413
I'm really sorry.

1972
01:22:21,501 --> 01:22:22,372
No.

1973
01:22:22,502 --> 01:22:23,827
We should get together sometime.- Yeah.

1974
01:22:23,851 --> 01:22:24,851
Yeah, definitely.

1975
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:25,810
Come on, let's get together.

1976
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,899
All right, I'll give you a call.

1977
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:28,595
Hey, you look good, man.

1978
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:32,860
Hey, likewise.

1979
01:22:32,991 --> 01:22:35,080
Hey, I might be getting married.

1980
01:22:38,214 --> 01:22:39,713
Have you been back
to class since then?

1981
01:22:39,737 --> 01:22:41,086
Well, yeah.

1982
01:22:41,217 --> 01:22:42,696
But I can barely look at him.

1983
01:22:42,827 --> 01:22:45,221
I'm still so furious.

1984
01:22:45,351 --> 01:22:49,573
Mary, I'm wondering
if this enormous anger

1985
01:22:49,703 --> 01:22:52,706
you have toward Doug is
not somewhat misplaced.

1986
01:22:52,837 --> 01:22:54,186
What do you mean?

1987
01:22:54,317 --> 01:22:57,624
Well, should he be so
harshlycondemned simply for finding

1988
01:22:57,755 --> 01:23:01,324
you sexually desirable?

1989
01:23:01,454 --> 01:23:03,848
Well, should I be gratefulto
him for wanting to kiss me?

1990
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,719
Is that what you're saying?

1991
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:09,767
Mary,
I know this is asensitive subject for you.

1992
01:23:09,897 --> 01:23:12,161
But please try toremember,
I'm on your side.

1993
01:23:15,294 --> 01:23:18,602
I believe that you doindeed
have some difficulty

1994
01:23:18,732 --> 01:23:21,997
in accepting yourself
as a beautiful, sexually

1995
01:23:22,127 --> 01:23:24,434
desirable young woman.

1996
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:26,697
Dr. Leuter, would you
please stop saying that?

1997
01:23:26,827 --> 01:23:28,264
Why?

1998
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:31,528
Well, honestly, it's
just a little weird

1999
01:23:31,658 --> 01:23:32,766
hearing it from my therapist.

2000
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:33,530
That's all.

2001
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:35,619
Yes, I am your therapist, Mary.

2002
01:23:35,749 --> 01:23:37,795
But I am also a man.

2003
01:23:37,925 --> 01:23:40,058
And I would be lying
to you if I said that I

2004
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:42,365
didn't have impulses as both.

2005
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:44,845
Do you think my lying to
you would be beneficial?

2006
01:23:44,976 --> 01:23:46,499
No.

2007
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,111
In truth,
I have entertainedsexual thoughts about you

2008
01:23:49,241 --> 01:23:50,634
many times during our meetings.

2009
01:23:50,764 --> 01:23:52,027
Dr. Leuter...

2010
01:23:52,157 --> 01:23:53,376
Let me finish, please.

2011
01:23:53,506 --> 01:23:54,986
OK.

2012
01:23:55,117 --> 01:23:57,597
In fact,
just a momentago while you were speaking,

2013
01:23:57,728 --> 01:24:01,949
and while I was utterly
andprofessionally engaged in what

2014
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:06,389
you were saying, part
of me was imagining

2015
01:24:06,519 --> 01:24:09,392
what your breasts wouldfeel
like naked in my hands.

2016
01:24:14,484 --> 01:24:15,833
I think I'd better leave.

2017
01:24:15,963 --> 01:24:16,964
- Mary...
- No.

2018
01:24:17,095 --> 01:24:18,749
Sit down, please.

2019
01:24:18,879 --> 01:24:21,012
Mary, please.

2020
01:24:21,143 --> 01:24:24,755
It is imperative that
you confront this issue.

2021
01:24:24,885 --> 01:24:26,278
Mary.

2022
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:28,410
Mary.

2023
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:37,526
What,
you got friendsall over the fucking place?

2024
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:40,336
Yes, I have friends,
as a matter of fact.

2025
01:24:40,466 --> 01:24:42,773
I am not your fucking dog!

2026
01:24:42,903 --> 01:24:44,035
Ugh. - Hey!

2027
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:45,515
Oh, my god.

2028
01:24:45,645 --> 01:24:46,883
Look, I'm not going to
fucking tell you again.

2029
01:24:46,907 --> 01:24:47,952
Hey!

2030
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,084
See what you made me do?

2031
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:50,322
- Take it easy.
- Listen to me.

2032
01:24:50,346 --> 01:24:51,129
You don't have to hit her.

2033
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:52,043
Who the fuck...

2034
01:24:52,174 --> 01:24:53,610
Shut the fuck up, asshole!- Hey!

2035
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:54,480
Will you just stop?

2036
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:55,960
I'm an asshole, huh?

2037
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:56,917
You're the asshole, pal.

2038
01:24:57,048 --> 01:24:58,049
Yeah, I'm an asshole?

2039
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:59,355
Oh, my god.

2040
01:24:59,485 --> 01:25:00,636
Want to get shot,
motherfucker, huh?

2041
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:01,985
Huh, fuck face, you
want to get shot?

2042
01:25:02,009 --> 01:25:03,009
Go ahead. Shoot me.

2043
01:25:03,054 --> 01:25:03,794
What, are you
fucking brave now...

2044
01:25:03,924 --> 01:25:04,490
- Go ahead.
- ...motherfucker?

2045
01:25:04,621 --> 01:25:05,361
Go ahead, do it.

2046
01:25:05,491 --> 01:25:06,555
You want me to
fucking shoot you?

2047
01:25:06,579 --> 01:25:07,687
Go ahead. Shoot the whole fucking world.

2048
01:25:07,711 --> 01:25:08,451
We don't care.

2049
01:25:08,581 --> 01:25:09,581
Go ahead.

2050
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:15,806
Lisa!

2051
01:25:15,936 --> 01:25:16,936
Come on, baby.

2052
01:25:33,302 --> 01:25:34,564
Excuse me, Ernst.

2053
01:25:34,694 --> 01:25:36,218
What is it?

2054
01:25:36,348 --> 01:25:37,543
You're probably going
to want to fire me.

2055
01:25:37,567 --> 01:25:41,962
But somehow, I lost my bow tie.

2056
01:25:42,093 --> 01:25:43,442
Jesus.

2057
01:25:43,573 --> 01:25:45,923
And Mary, Joseph, and Moses.

2058
01:25:46,053 --> 01:25:47,446
I've looked everywhere for it.

2059
01:25:47,577 --> 01:25:49,448
It must've fallen out of my bag.

2060
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:50,710
Well.

2061
01:25:50,841 --> 01:25:52,712
I know you're really
short tonight.

2062
01:25:52,843 --> 01:25:55,280
And I feel terrible.

2063
01:25:58,762 --> 01:25:59,762
Come here, Joe.

2064
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:17,128
This is called a four-in-hand.

2065
01:26:17,259 --> 01:26:19,478
Do you know how to tie it?

2066
01:26:19,609 --> 01:26:20,349
No, sir.

2067
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:23,221
Mine was a clip-on.

2068
01:26:23,352 --> 01:26:25,180
Are you on for
the lunch tomorrow?

2069
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:28,095
No, I wasn't told.

2070
01:26:28,226 --> 01:26:29,836
Put it in your book.

2071
01:26:29,967 --> 01:26:31,098
Thank you, Ernst.

2072
01:26:31,229 --> 01:26:33,623
I'll make sure I
have my own tie.

2073
01:26:33,753 --> 01:26:35,059
Keep this one.

2074
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,800
Looks better on you.

2075
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:49,421
And hit.

2076
01:26:49,552 --> 01:26:50,292
Huh!

2077
01:26:50,422 --> 01:26:51,422
And hit.

2078
01:26:51,467 --> 01:26:52,207
Huh!

2079
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:53,556
OK.

2080
01:26:53,686 --> 01:26:55,993
Um, we've got about
a minute left.

2081
01:26:56,123 --> 01:26:57,843
Chantal, why don't you
come up to the front?

2082
01:26:57,951 --> 01:26:59,605
Doug, could someone else go?

2083
01:26:59,736 --> 01:27:01,607
I don't feel that good today.

2084
01:27:01,738 --> 01:27:03,479
Oh, Chantal, I mean, your RRQ is

2085
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:05,481
one of the lowest in the class.

2086
01:27:05,611 --> 01:27:07,570
I really feel right
now if we go for it,

2087
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:09,069
we can possibly bring
you up 25 points.

2088
01:27:09,093 --> 01:27:10,442
What do you say? Come on.

2089
01:27:14,794 --> 01:27:15,839
OK.

2090
01:27:15,969 --> 01:27:18,407
Now, just relax.

2091
01:27:18,537 --> 01:27:20,496
Come on, big mama.

2092
01:27:20,626 --> 01:27:23,542
I got something for you
right here, big mama.

2093
01:27:23,673 --> 01:27:24,673
It's all yours, big mama.

2094
01:27:24,761 --> 01:27:25,501
Come on.

2095
01:27:25,631 --> 01:27:26,850
Come on.

2096
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:27,546
OK. OK.

2097
01:27:27,677 --> 01:27:28,721
OK.

2098
01:27:28,852 --> 01:27:29,592
That's enough.

2099
01:27:29,722 --> 01:27:30,854
You all right? - Mm.

2100
01:27:30,984 --> 01:27:31,984
It's OK.

2101
01:27:35,772 --> 01:27:40,516
Class, remember,
tears are anentirely appropriate response,

2102
01:27:40,646 --> 01:27:42,126
OK?

2103
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,377
Mary, why don't you come up?

2104
01:27:47,914 --> 01:27:50,003
How have you been?

2105
01:27:50,134 --> 01:27:51,396
Good.

2106
01:27:51,527 --> 01:27:53,268
You seem a little
upset about something.

2107
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:54,398
You OK?

2108
01:27:54,486 --> 01:27:55,792
Never better.

2109
01:27:55,922 --> 01:27:57,228
OK.

2110
01:27:57,359 --> 01:27:59,491
So why don't you
turn around some

2111
01:27:59,622 --> 01:28:02,712
of that sweet little
cupcake ass of yours?

2112
01:28:02,842 --> 01:28:05,541
Come on.

2113
01:28:05,671 --> 01:28:06,803
Unh!

2114
01:28:06,933 --> 01:28:08,500
One, two, three, four!

2115
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:09,631
Oh!

2116
01:28:09,675 --> 01:28:10,546
Unh!

2117
01:28:10,676 --> 01:28:13,113
Ah!

2118
01:28:13,244 --> 01:28:14,245
And a knee to the groin!

2119
01:28:18,902 --> 01:28:19,902
Yay!

2120
01:28:26,997 --> 01:28:27,824
Mary!

2121
01:28:27,954 --> 01:28:28,781
Mary!

2122
01:28:28,912 --> 01:28:29,739
Mary!

2123
01:28:29,869 --> 01:28:30,869
Mary!

2124
01:28:34,396 --> 01:28:37,007
I had an abortion.

2125
01:28:37,137 --> 01:28:38,182
So what?

2126
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,010
Dirk, how can you be so cruel?

2127
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:41,403
I'm not cruel, Deanna.

2128
01:28:41,533 --> 01:28:42,969
I'm honest.

2129
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,058
And here.

2130
01:28:45,189 --> 01:28:49,106
I brought you something.

2131
01:28:49,236 --> 01:28:50,455
I love you, Dirk.

2132
01:28:57,941 --> 01:29:00,335
Oh, my god.

2133
01:29:00,465 --> 01:29:02,424
She finally did it.

2134
01:29:19,571 --> 01:29:20,746
Hi. Joe Finnegan.

2135
01:29:20,877 --> 01:29:21,877
I have a 7:45.

2136
01:29:24,184 --> 01:29:27,449
They just took the 8:00.

2137
01:29:27,579 --> 01:29:28,711
Sorry.

2138
01:29:28,841 --> 01:29:30,800
You're going to have to wait.

2139
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:31,930
OK?

2140
01:29:40,026 --> 01:29:41,026
Joe?

2141
01:29:43,987 --> 01:29:45,902
Joe?

2142
01:29:46,032 --> 01:29:47,032
Joe?

2143
01:29:56,565 --> 01:29:57,565
Hi, Mary.

2144
01:29:57,609 --> 01:29:59,002
It's Sahara.

2145
01:29:59,132 --> 01:30:00,525
You're not going
to believe this,

2146
01:30:00,656 --> 01:30:02,397
but I think I'm getting married.

2147
01:30:02,527 --> 01:30:03,267
I know it's crazy.

2148
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,137
But I'm in love.

2149
01:30:04,268 --> 01:30:05,008
Give me a call.

2150
01:30:05,138 --> 01:30:06,226
OK, bye.

2151
01:30:07,837 --> 01:30:10,492
Joeand Mary, quite contrary.

2152
01:30:10,622 --> 01:30:13,712
Some might call
them adversaries.

2153
01:30:13,843 --> 01:30:18,717
Nonetheless, I must
confessshe's the one I love the best.

2154
01:30:18,848 --> 01:30:19,848
I'll see you tonight.

2155
01:30:23,069 --> 01:30:23,809
Thanks, man.

2156
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,245
Great script. Really good.

2157
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:26,571
- We'll talk to you,
all right?- Bye, Dee Dee.

2158
01:30:26,595 --> 01:30:27,334
Big kiss.

2159
01:30:27,465 --> 01:30:28,684
Mwah.

2160
01:30:28,814 --> 01:30:29,554
See ya, Larry.

2161
01:30:29,685 --> 01:30:31,426
See you later.

2162
01:30:31,556 --> 01:30:33,863
Great to see you, Lawrence.

2163
01:30:33,993 --> 01:30:35,125
Next, please.

2164
01:30:35,255 --> 01:30:36,255
Finnegan.

2165
01:30:38,694 --> 01:30:40,826
Oh, dammit, I've
got one more here.

2166
01:30:40,957 --> 01:30:42,306
Who's this guy, anyway?

2167
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,743
Ah, he's Joe Finnegan.

2168
01:30:44,874 --> 01:30:45,981
I told you I thought
you should see him.

2169
01:30:46,005 --> 01:30:49,008
I'd like two white
wines and a Bloody Mary.

2170
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:50,706
Frankly, pal, so would I.

2171
01:30:50,836 --> 01:30:52,156
Joe, why are you
wearing a tuxedo?

2172
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:53,273
Sorry, Miss Taylor.

2173
01:30:53,404 --> 01:30:54,404
I just got off work.

2174
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:55,798
I didn't have time to change.

2175
01:30:55,928 --> 01:30:58,365
Joe, most of these
parts are already cast.

2176
01:30:58,496 --> 01:31:02,892
But since you are
the last one, we

2177
01:31:03,022 --> 01:31:06,112
are going to let you readthe
Nick and Shelley scene.

2178
01:31:06,243 --> 01:31:07,287
Now, that is Tina.

2179
01:31:07,418 --> 01:31:08,778
She's going to be
reading with you.

2180
01:31:11,988 --> 01:31:12,858
Hey.

2181
01:31:12,989 --> 01:31:13,990
I know you.

2182
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:16,601
The Madonna video?

2183
01:31:16,732 --> 01:31:17,559
Don't you remember?

2184
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:19,256
You thought I
really was Madonna?

2185
01:31:19,386 --> 01:31:20,431
Oh, my god.

2186
01:31:20,562 --> 01:31:21,127
You look completely different.

2187
01:31:21,258 --> 01:31:23,303
You changed your hair.

2188
01:31:23,434 --> 01:31:25,305
Yeah, I'm... I'm
back to my real color.

2189
01:31:25,436 --> 01:31:26,176
OK.

2190
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:27,177
OK.

2191
01:31:27,307 --> 01:31:28,918
It's fairly simple.

2192
01:31:29,048 --> 01:31:31,137
You are a serial killer.

2193
01:31:31,268 --> 01:31:33,966
A very sexy serial killer.

2194
01:31:34,097 --> 01:31:37,666
She thinks that you lovekilling
more than you love her.

2195
01:31:37,796 --> 01:31:39,755
So she grabs the
gun that you have

2196
01:31:39,885 --> 01:31:42,758
just used to kill her
father, and mother,

2197
01:31:42,888 --> 01:31:43,933
and sister, and brother.

2198
01:31:44,063 --> 01:31:45,412
I... I still...

2199
01:31:45,543 --> 01:31:46,738
I really don't
think the brother.

2200
01:31:46,762 --> 01:31:48,304
It's too much.- No, you need the brother.

2201
01:31:48,328 --> 01:31:49,373
He's symbolic.

2202
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,507
Would you two please
just mind saving this?

2203
01:31:52,637 --> 01:31:53,725
I will make this decision.

2204
01:31:53,856 --> 01:31:54,596
All right.

2205
01:31:54,726 --> 01:31:56,641
All right?

2206
01:31:56,772 --> 01:31:59,252
Anytime you're ready.

2207
01:31:59,383 --> 01:32:01,167
I love you, Shelley.

2208
01:32:01,298 --> 01:32:01,820
Give me the gun.

2209
01:32:01,951 --> 01:32:02,995
No.

2210
01:32:03,126 --> 01:32:03,866
Give it to me.

2211
01:32:03,996 --> 01:32:04,780
You don't love me.

2212
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:06,433
I do.

2213
01:32:06,564 --> 01:32:09,175
Tell me one thing
that you love about me.

2214
01:32:09,306 --> 01:32:11,047
Tell me.

2215
01:32:11,177 --> 01:32:12,177
I love your hair.

2216
01:32:15,312 --> 01:32:16,792
I love your breath.

2217
01:32:16,922 --> 01:32:19,098
Your skin, your eyes.

2218
01:32:19,229 --> 01:32:22,841
I love your smile, your touch.

2219
01:32:22,972 --> 01:32:27,585
I love the way you fall asleepat night,
holding my finger.

2220
01:32:27,716 --> 01:32:28,716
Please.

2221
01:32:31,502 --> 01:32:34,244
Please.

2222
01:32:34,374 --> 01:32:35,374
Give me the gun.

2223
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:43,122
Changed some of
the lines there, Joe.

2224
01:32:43,253 --> 01:32:44,297
I'm sorry.

2225
01:32:44,428 --> 01:32:45,560
I got a little lost. Thanks.

2226
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:46,690
No, no, no, no. Wait.

2227
01:32:46,735 --> 01:32:47,735
Wait, wait.

2228
01:32:50,652 --> 01:32:52,044
I'll just ask, of course.

2229
01:32:52,175 --> 01:32:53,219
Well, find out.

2230
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:56,483
Uh, Joe, we'd like to see a...

2231
01:32:56,614 --> 01:32:57,876
Something else now.

2232
01:32:58,007 --> 01:33:01,010
Something, um... a
little different tone.

2233
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:01,880
Right now?

2234
01:33:02,011 --> 01:33:03,186
Anything you want, Joe.

2235
01:33:03,316 --> 01:33:06,189
Um, we just want to get someidea of,
uh, your range.

2236
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:07,359
Do you have anything, Joe?

2237
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:14,370
You know, Biff.

2238
01:33:17,548 --> 01:33:21,160
Sometimes I just want
to rip my clothes off

2239
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:23,486
in the middle of that store
andoutbox that goddamn merchandise

2240
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:24,510
manager.

2241
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:38,830
I mean, I can outbox,
outrun, and outlift

2242
01:33:38,961 --> 01:33:42,138
anybody in that store.

2243
01:33:42,268 --> 01:33:47,926
And still, I have to take ordersfrom
those common, petty sons

2244
01:33:48,057 --> 01:33:50,059
of bitches till I
can't stand it anymore.

2245
01:33:56,892 --> 01:34:04,892
See, Biff, everybody
around me is so false.

2246
01:34:05,552 --> 01:34:07,293
I'm constantly
lowering my ideals.

2247
01:34:13,299 --> 01:34:14,299
Oh, my god.

2248
01:34:18,435 --> 01:34:20,567
Ah, you see?

2249
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:21,936
Told you my instincts
were never wrong.

2250
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,309
That was very good, Joe.

2251
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,007
Very, very good.

2252
01:34:25,137 --> 01:34:27,662
Bravo!

2253
01:34:44,417 --> 01:34:48,465
Hey, I just got
a part in a movie.

2254
01:34:48,595 --> 01:34:49,595
I still can't believe it.

2255
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:51,468
My first part in a movie.

2256
01:34:51,598 --> 01:34:53,339
They all loved you, Joe.

2257
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:54,470
You were so great.

2258
01:34:54,558 --> 01:34:55,602
I was great?

2259
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:57,474
Well, you know, you were great.

2260
01:34:57,604 --> 01:34:59,321
I mean, I don't know why
you're not acting in it.

2261
01:34:59,345 --> 01:35:00,825
No, I'm not an actress, Joe.

2262
01:35:00,956 --> 01:35:03,175
I know that now.

2263
01:35:03,306 --> 01:35:06,657
What about standing
in for Madonna?

2264
01:35:06,788 --> 01:35:08,659
Blonde, black, back to blonde.

2265
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:11,444
My hair couldn't
take it anymore.

2266
01:35:11,575 --> 01:35:13,185
I think your hair
looks great this way.

2267
01:35:13,316 --> 01:35:14,752
Yeah.

2268
01:35:14,883 --> 01:35:16,014
I think it looks great.

2269
01:35:21,759 --> 01:35:22,959
I wanted to do that all night.

2270
01:35:26,068 --> 01:35:28,374
Hey, I just got
a part in a movie.

2271
01:35:28,505 --> 01:35:29,505
That's incredible.

2272
01:35:34,511 --> 01:35:36,687
A friend of mine told
me about this place.

2273
01:35:36,818 --> 01:35:39,168
You see all these waitresses?

2274
01:35:39,298 --> 01:35:40,865
They're all models, all of them.

2275
01:35:40,996 --> 01:35:41,996
High-class models.

2276
01:35:48,655 --> 01:35:50,614
You're so sexy, Joe.

2277
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:52,877
I want you right now.

2278
01:35:53,008 --> 01:35:56,098
Tina, I want you too.

2279
01:35:56,228 --> 01:35:58,274
When you said thosethings
you loved about me,

2280
01:35:58,404 --> 01:36:00,711
it felt like you really
meant it, like, you

2281
01:36:00,842 --> 01:36:03,366
were really talking to me.

2282
01:36:03,496 --> 01:36:04,193
Oh, this is crazy.

2283
01:36:04,323 --> 01:36:05,063
I know.

2284
01:36:05,194 --> 01:36:06,282
Sorry.

2285
01:36:06,412 --> 01:36:07,762
Let's go back to my place.

2286
01:36:07,892 --> 01:36:08,632
No.

2287
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:10,199
Boy, I'd really like to.

2288
01:36:10,329 --> 01:36:11,069
But...

2289
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,288
I like you too, Joe.

2290
01:36:12,418 --> 01:36:13,463
No.

2291
01:36:13,593 --> 01:36:14,593
No, I mean, I got to go.

2292
01:36:14,681 --> 01:36:15,770
You gotta go?

2293
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:17,249
I'm sorry, Tina.

2294
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:20,296
I... you going to be all right?

2295
01:36:20,426 --> 01:36:21,645
Yeah.

2296
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,056
Yeah, I'm going to be all right.

2297
01:36:27,694 --> 01:36:29,479
It's good to see you again, Joe.

2298
01:36:29,609 --> 01:36:30,609
You too, Tina.

2299
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,808
Mary...

2300
01:36:53,938 --> 01:36:54,678
Joe.

2301
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,158
I got the part.

2302
01:36:56,288 --> 01:36:57,333
Did you?

2303
01:36:57,463 --> 01:36:59,378
A part in a film.

2304
01:36:59,509 --> 01:37:00,771
And there's money.

2305
01:37:00,902 --> 01:37:04,644
Joe... Joe, that's fantastic.

2306
01:37:04,775 --> 01:37:06,124
Joe.

2307
01:37:06,255 --> 01:37:07,386
Joe.

2308
01:37:07,517 --> 01:37:10,694
Joe, do I have a sexual problem?

2309
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:13,349
Are you crazy?

2310
01:37:13,479 --> 01:37:15,839
Dr. Leuter said I had a
sexualproblem because I didn't want

2311
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,527
to hear his fantasies about me.

2312
01:37:17,657 --> 01:37:19,311
What fantasies?

2313
01:37:19,442 --> 01:37:21,618
He said he was a man
andwondered what my breasts would

2314
01:37:21,748 --> 01:37:24,099
feel like naked in his hands.

2315
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:25,229
Well, I'm a man.

2316
01:37:25,274 --> 01:37:26,425
And he's going to
wonder what my fist

2317
01:37:26,449 --> 01:37:27,609
feels like naked in his face.

2318
01:37:30,888 --> 01:37:32,344
You don't think I
have a sexual problem?

2319
01:37:32,368 --> 01:37:34,936
Hell, no.

2320
01:37:35,066 --> 01:37:36,589
But even you said
I wasn't spontaneous.

2321
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:43,118
Well, did I?

2322
01:37:43,248 --> 01:37:46,208
Oh, come on, Mary.

2323
01:37:46,338 --> 01:37:48,906
I meant both of us.

2324
01:37:49,037 --> 01:37:50,473
You're still attracted to me?

2325
01:37:50,603 --> 01:37:52,127
Of course I am.

2326
01:37:52,257 --> 01:37:55,478
We haven't made love
in over two months.

2327
01:37:55,608 --> 01:37:56,348
I know that.

2328
01:37:56,479 --> 01:37:57,567
Are you kidding?

2329
01:37:57,697 --> 01:37:59,874
I'm very aware of that.

2330
01:38:00,004 --> 01:38:02,311
Maybe you're not
attracted to me.

2331
01:38:02,441 --> 01:38:04,356
How can you say that?

2332
01:38:04,487 --> 01:38:06,793
Maybe you're attracted
toguys like your self-defense

2333
01:38:06,924 --> 01:38:09,927
teacher and his big fancy BMW.

2334
01:38:10,058 --> 01:38:13,104
Joe, I am very attracted to you.

2335
01:38:16,847 --> 01:38:22,331
I'm very, very, very
attracted to you, Mary.

2336
01:38:22,461 --> 01:38:25,987
I am very, very, very
attracted to you, Joe.

2337
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:54,189
God.

2338
01:39:06,592 --> 01:39:08,029
Jesus Christ.

2339
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,379
Joe, you were incredible.

2340
01:39:10,509 --> 01:39:11,554
Me?

2341
01:39:11,684 --> 01:39:12,947
What about you?

2342
01:39:13,077 --> 01:39:14,426
You little rabbit.

2343
01:39:14,557 --> 01:39:16,863
You little sex rabbit.

2344
01:39:16,994 --> 01:39:17,994
Carrot boy.

2345
01:39:22,391 --> 01:39:23,740
Wow.

2346
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:26,221
Hey, how did you know
my teacher had a BMW?

2347
01:39:26,351 --> 01:39:28,049
Does he?

2348
01:39:28,179 --> 01:39:29,179
Yeah.

2349
01:39:32,705 --> 01:39:34,707
Lucky guess.

2350
01:39:34,838 --> 01:39:36,622
Sorry about the rubber.

2351
01:39:36,753 --> 01:39:37,753
You think we'll be OK?

2352
01:39:40,539 --> 01:39:42,411
I don't know.

2353
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:43,541
Hope so.

2354
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,367
Good morning.

2355
01:40:25,497 --> 01:40:28,848
How do you like your eggs, baby?

2356
01:40:28,979 --> 01:40:29,762
Over easy.

2357
01:40:29,893 --> 01:40:30,633
All righty.

2358
01:40:30,763 --> 01:40:32,939
Over easy it is.

2359
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:36,073
Everything is going tobe
easy from here on out.

2360
01:40:36,204 --> 01:40:39,120
And you know what I've
decided for the wedding?

2361
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:42,036
I go back to my real color.

2362
01:40:42,166 --> 01:40:42,949
Brunette again.

2363
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:44,647
I haven't been a
brunette in years.

2364
01:40:44,777 --> 01:40:45,777
I don't know how long.

2365
01:40:48,651 --> 01:40:52,046
That's the real me anyway.

2366
01:40:52,176 --> 01:40:55,136
And who more would you
want than the real me?

2367
01:40:55,266 --> 01:40:56,833
Nothing more than
just absolutely me.

2368
01:40:56,963 --> 01:40:58,203
I feel so comfortable with you.

2369
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,099
I'm so excited about this.

2370
01:41:33,391 --> 01:41:34,610
Buddy.

2371
01:41:34,634 --> 01:41:37,634

3
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:18,809
So my question to you is,

4
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:22,178
why didn't you shoot her
from a distance?

5
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,281
You got a nice scope
on that rifle.

6
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:28,585
You could have climbed up
those hills behind her house

7
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:30,154
and shot her
in the front yard

8
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,255
and said it was
a hunting accident,

9
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:34,791
and no one would have
suspected anything,

10
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,226
because no one knew
there was anything going on

11
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:39,331
between you two, right?

12
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,110
Why did you kill her?

13
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:11,287
Did you get my egg roll?

14
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:12,691
Yeah.

15
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,363
- Where's Amber?
- She's got a date.

16
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,965
She said you'd be mad,
but I can watch Jody.

17
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:24,204
I'm old enough.

18
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:46,960
You're supposed to be watching
the kids tonight.

19
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:53,864
Misty's 12.

20
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,631
She can babysit
a six-year-old.

21
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:59,004
They shouldn't be left alone
in the house at night.

22
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:05,544
What is your problem?

23
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,681
Admit it,
you just hate the idea

24
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:13,816
that I have a life
and you don't.

25
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:16,053
You're just mad
because you have to work.

26
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,387
Well, you'd have to work
anyways, Harley.

27
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,091
I fucking promise you,
you're not going to college

28
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:23,659
or doing anything meaningful
with your life.

29
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:25,529
Meaningful.

30
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,764
Like fucking guys
in the back of pick-up trucks?

31
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:32,538
You'd give anything
to fuck someone.

32
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:44,613
Why aren't you eating?

33
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,550
I'm making my list
of things to do.

34
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,618
I don't like
hot dogs anyway.

35
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,952
You always eat hot dogs.

36
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:52,089
Not like that.
I like them long now.

37
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,591
Esme says cut-up hot dogs
are the number one cause

38
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:58,495
of choking deaths among children
in the United States.

39
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,697
She told me
on the bus today.

40
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,531
Live dangerously.

41
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,800
- I won't eat it.
- You have to.

42
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,034
I do not.

43
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:07,774
Harley, tell her
she has to eat it.

44
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,675
I don't care
if she eats it.

45
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:12,875
I'll eat it if you fix it.

46
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:14,411
And how am I going
to fix it?

47
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:15,745
With glue.

48
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:17,848
Eating glue would kill you.

49
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,483
Then make me another one.

50
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,551
- I don't want to.
- Make me another one.

51
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:24,823
You can have my last one.

52
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,493
There's mustard on it.

53
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,026
Wipe it off.

54
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:33,365
Fine.

55
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:39,101
Do you want to hear
my fortune?

56
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:41,471
I have to go to work.
Can you tell me tomorrow?

57
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:43,475
No, you got to hear it now.

58
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:51,014
"You are the master
of every situation."

59
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:52,785
It's for you.

60
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:56,422
Thank you.

61
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:47,170
Hey, Harley.

62
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:48,605
Hey.

63
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:51,007
How are you?

64
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:52,845
I'm okay.

65
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,079
The girls?

66
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,917
They're fine.

67
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:02,586
Jody told Esme
that you won't let Amber

68
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,753
get her driver's permit.

69
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,822
She can get it
when she gets a job

70
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:08,625
and she can pay
for her own insurance.

71
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:09,925
Oh.

72
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,795
It's, like,
a thousand bucks.

73
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,663
You've really become
the full-fledged

74
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:15,168
head of the household.

75
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,605
Esme's been bugging me to have
Jody over for dinner again.

76
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,109
I was thinking Monday.

77
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:26,108
Monday's Jody's night to cook,

78
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,178
but I guess we can all pour
our own bowls of cereal.

79
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:35,017
This is nice.

80
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,752
What do you mean?

81
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:39,725
No kids.
I left them at home with Brad.

82
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:44,060
This is nice,
shopping by myself.

83
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:46,762
It's the most relaxing thing
I've done in weeks.

84
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,666
It's kind of pathetic,

85
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:52,836
coming to a grocery store
for fun.

86
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:55,204
It's not as pathetic
as working in one.

87
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,877
It's a lot more pathetic.

88
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,978
I should finish up.

89
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,880
Okay.

90
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:07,082
Well, remember to send Jody
with a note on the bus

91
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:10,019
so that she can get off
with Esme on Monday, okay?

92
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,723
Okay.

93
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,430
What the fuck?

94
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,703
Harley, you fucking shit!

95
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,080
I fucking hate you!

96
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,415
Please, don't go.

97
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,949
Go back to bed.

98
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:56,087
Wait.

99
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,967
Harley, listen to me!

100
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:13,706
I fucking hate you,
Harley!

101
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,443
I hate you.

102
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,078
Get off me!

103
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,816
Go over there!

104
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,117
What's a lethal injection?

105
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,884
Where'd you hear that?

106
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:40,455
Tyler at school.
He says Mom's going to get one.

107
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:42,858
Mom's not going to get one.

108
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,228
Esme says it's what the vet
gives old dogs

109
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,296
when they're having trouble
dying.

110
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:50,098
She said people don't get them,
because they don't need them.

111
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,004
They die on their own.

112
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:54,871
She's right.

113
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,605
Mom's not going to die, is she?

114
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,273
No.

115
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:01,009
I don't want her to die,
even if she killed Daddy.

116
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:04,048
I can't talk about this shit
while I'm driving, okay?

117
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,421
Do you want
to hear a joke?

118
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:14,089
Sure.

119
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:17,493
What does a vampire say
when you do him a favor?

120
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,362
I don't know.

121
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:21,030
"Fangs a lot."

122
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,373
Mommy, I missed you.

123
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,241
Harley, I thought...

124
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:08,377
I thought I wouldn't
see you again.

125
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,412
Oh, my baby.

126
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:12,050
Hi.

127
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:20,522
You look...

128
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:22,360
different.

129
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,268
Where do we keep
the extra light bulbs?

130
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:40,008
I think they're in
the bathroom,

131
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,149
under the sink,
to the right.

132
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:47,385
Do we have any?

133
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,353
Well, I don't know.
It's...

134
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:53,388
it's been a long time.

135
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,027
Mommy, look at the picture
I brought you.

136
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,127
Is that your father's coat?

137
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:03,031
He wears it all the time.

138
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:05,069
Look at my picture.

139
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:09,472
Yay. Yippee.

140
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,911
That's so pretty.

141
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,451
Where's Misty?

142
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:24,152
She didn't want to come.

143
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:26,723
Harley wouldn't
let her come.

144
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,458
Why not?

145
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,527
They fight in the truck
and it drives me crazy.

146
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:35,333
Do you want to know
where Amber is?

147
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:41,436
Amber's a big girl,
so she probably has plans.

148
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:43,573
She's started dating.

149
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,677
Define dating.

150
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:52,650
Harley, what's wrong with you?

151
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,656
You want to be here.

152
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:04,594
That's ridiculous.

153
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,462
No.

154
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:08,097
You want to be here.

155
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,007
Harley. Harley!

156
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,387
If you don't trust Amber
to watch your sisters at night,

157
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,623
what about someone else?
How about a relative?

158
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,526
I told you before,
Mom doesn't have any family.

159
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,829
And Dad's family won't have
anything to do with us.

160
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:43,232
- Oh, why do you think that is?
- Because we're related to Mom.

161
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:46,502
You're related
to your father too.

162
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,606
Not as closely.

163
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:53,408
What about Uncle Mike?

164
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,780
I thought you said
he was helping out lately.

165
00:16:57,414 --> 00:17:01,184
He's been bringing me
cases of Pabst.

166
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,820
I guess that's helpful.

167
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,822
Cash would be more helpful,
in my opinion.

168
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,292
Alcohol is not a solution
to your problems.

169
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,360
I didn't say anything
about alcohol.

170
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,265
I was talking about beer.

171
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:20,736
Let's get back
to your mother.

172
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,805
This was a big step for you.

173
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,443
When do you think
you'll see her again?

174
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,481
I don't know.

175
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:35,319
You are planning
on seeing her again, aren't you?

176
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:47,263
You made an interesting comment

177
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:50,232
about your mother
being more concerned

178
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:52,602
about the girls
than she is about you.

179
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,773
Why do you think
that's true?

180
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:58,673
Because they're girls.

181
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:00,711
Why should that matter?

182
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,680
Girls can get pregnant.

183
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:08,217
A guy can walk away
from it.

184
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:09,651
Hmm.

185
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,453
What about you?

186
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:12,721
What if you got
a girl pregnant?

187
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:15,126
Would you just
walk away from it?

188
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:18,363
I'd marry her.

189
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,498
Interesting.

190
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,267
Why?

191
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,835
Because you answered
so quickly.

192
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:28,773
What if you didn't
love the girl?

193
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,440
I had sex with her, right?

194
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:34,643
Yes.

195
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:39,181
So you're saying you wouldn't
have sex with a girl

196
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:41,119
unless you love her.

197
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:46,758
If she would have sex with me,
then I would love her.

198
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:57,499
What if a wife and child
would interfere

199
00:18:57,501 --> 00:19:00,305
with your future plans?

200
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,539
If I got her pregnant,

201
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,244
it would mean
I was being stupid.

202
00:19:07,878 --> 00:19:10,314
So, you'd marry her
out of responsibility?

203
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:14,318
I guess so.

204
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,286
You'd commit yourself
to another human being

205
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:22,661
for the rest of your life
as a form of punishment.

206
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,371
Did you like your father,
Harley?

207
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,607
Did you respect him?

208
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:41,776
He did everything
he was supposed to.

209
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:44,950
Including beating his children?
Was he supposed to do that?

210
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,988
He thought he was.

211
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,959
Good.

212
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,196
Why do you think that?

213
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,770
I don't want to talk about him
anymore.

214
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:10,305
I have to go.

215
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:12,341
We haven't finished
your session yet.

216
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:15,447
My apologies
to the taxpayers.

217
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,657
Slow down, little man.

218
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:30,058
- How are you?
- Okay.

219
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,727
I was just on the phone
with Misty.

220
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,528
I told her I'd drive Jody home
for you.

221
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,564
That's okay.

222
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:37,600
Well, have you had dinner?

223
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:40,902
Yeah, I ate in town.

224
00:20:40,904 --> 00:20:42,971
Well, I have something
for you anyway.

225
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:45,341
You want to come in
for a minute?

226
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:46,776
In?

227
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,576
In the house.

228
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,348
Sure.

229
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,688
Do me a favor, Harley.

230
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,488
Have the last pork chop.

231
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,458
Oh, that's okay.

232
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,460
Big guy like you can't finish
off that little pork chop?

233
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,830
What about your husband?

234
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:10,402
He won't want it.
He's eating out tonight.

235
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,405
Do you want a beer?

236
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:18,909
Sure.

237
00:21:24,115 --> 00:21:26,484
You are old enough to drink,
right?

238
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:56,411
- This is great.
- Thanks.

239
00:21:56,413 --> 00:21:58,616
Jody liked them too.

240
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:03,451
Can we have
something to eat?

241
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:05,453
Baby, you just had dinner. No.

242
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:06,822
That's it, no more.

243
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:08,690
Did you eat
these pork chops?

244
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:10,860
I loved them.

245
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,995
But you hate pork chops.

246
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:16,164
I hate your pork chops.
They taste like napkins.

247
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,901
It's probably just the marinade.
I'll give you the recipe.

248
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:22,470
Esme Jane,
where are your shoes?

249
00:22:22,472 --> 00:22:23,905
- Outside.
- It's not summer yet.

250
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:26,642
Go put them back on.
Right now. Go, go, go.

251
00:22:31,648 --> 00:22:33,815
Esme's kind of a weird name.

252
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:36,885
Where'd you get it?

253
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:38,853
It was the name of a model
and a mistress

254
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:42,961
of one of my favorite artists,
a French Impressionist.

255
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,754
He paints like
Pierre Bonnard.

256
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:14,559
You know who
Pierre Bonnard is?

257
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,828
Yeah.

258
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,463
My mom had these note cards

259
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:24,165
she got from
the Art Institute of Chicago.

260
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:27,135
Had one of his paintings
on the front.

261
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:29,872
Table Set in a Garden.

262
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:31,974
So you're familiar
with his work.

263
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:34,946
I'm familiar
with his note cards.

264
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:40,684
I like Impressionists.

265
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:45,153
They don't care about what
something really looks like.

266
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:48,023
They only care about
how looking at something

267
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,061
makes a person feel.

268
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:55,800
It's the definition
of Impressionism.

269
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:14,249
You're wearing my shirt.
I told you to stop doing that.

270
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:15,854
Take it off.

271
00:24:21,558 --> 00:24:23,959
- What are you doing?
- You said take it off.

272
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:27,932
Put it back on right now.
Put it back on right now.

273
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,841
There you go.

274
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:47,751
A purple one.
I needed another purple one.

275
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:52,020
You're late tonight.

276
00:24:52,022 --> 00:24:54,323
I was hoping
you finally decided to split,

277
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:56,292
and then I could
get my license.

278
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,892
You're so stupid, Amber.

279
00:24:57,894 --> 00:24:59,260
You just don't get it,
do you?

280
00:24:59,262 --> 00:25:01,697
- What don't I get?
- I can't afford it.

281
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:04,732
Which word don't you
understand?

282
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:06,768
I understand all of them.

283
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,304
I don't make enough money

284
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:12,074
to come up with an extra
thousand bucks so you can drive.

285
00:25:12,076 --> 00:25:13,776
How did Daddy do it?

286
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,744
Dad made good money.

287
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:17,779
- Driving a cement mixer?
- Yeah.

288
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:19,981
So why you can't you drive
a cement mixer?

289
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:23,218
I can drive
a cement mixer.

290
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,156
I just can't get a job
driving a cement mixer.

291
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:39,234
Did you lose another tooth?

292
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:40,672
Yeah.

293
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:47,176
I suppose you can't afford
a quarter.

294
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,245
Harley doesn't pay for my teeth.
The tooth fairy does.

295
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:52,815
Except I don't understand
why the tooth fairy

296
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,252
only gives me a quarter
and gives Esme a dollar.

297
00:25:57,253 --> 00:25:59,354
Esme's mom brought you
a present.

298
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:02,891
I wouldn't call it
a present.

299
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:04,692
What are you talking about?

300
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:06,894
Well, she stopped by
this afternoon

301
00:26:06,896 --> 00:26:10,164
and she brought you
some recipes and an art book.

302
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,167
Are you turning into a fag
or something?

303
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:14,068
What's a fag?

304
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,138
I mean, I guess you
might as well be a faggot,

305
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,176
because you can't get a girl
to make it with you.

306
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:23,144
- What book?
- A giant book.

307
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:25,014
It's a book from
the Art Institute of Chicago.

308
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,349
Miss Mercer put a Post-it
on the front of it

309
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:30,251
with all of the pages of photos
she thought you might like.

310
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,955
It's too weird
and gross, okay?

311
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:34,856
That woman needs
to get a life.

312
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:37,892
You should have seen what she
was wearing for someone her age.

313
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:40,194
What was she wearing?

314
00:26:40,196 --> 00:26:42,398
Pink denim shorts

315
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,333
that were way too fucking tight
for her.

316
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:45,901
You are so jealous of her

317
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,036
because she has the exact shorts
you want.

318
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:49,371
Shut up.

319
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:51,206
Women like that
are pathetic.

320
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,676
They think men want to look
at them after they hit 30.

321
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,178
I can't wait to see you
in your 30s.

322
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,447
Oh, you won't know me
in my 30s.

323
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:00,783
I will be so out of here.

324
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,383
You'll be living down the road

325
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:06,788
in a trailer with five kids
and no husband.

326
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,023
You know what, Harley?

327
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,290
I was going
to do you a favor,

328
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:11,826
and now you can go
fuck yourself.

329
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:14,063
The only favor you can do me
is get a job.

330
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,465
What if I knew someone who
wanted to go out with you?

331
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:18,167
I'm not interested.

332
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,201
You don't even know
who it is.

333
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,840
If it's someone you know,
I'm not interested.

334
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:27,342
What if she wanted to...

335
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:30,712
Harley, look at me.

336
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:33,414
Look at me.

337
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,720
What if she wanted to fuck you?

338
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,057
I'm serious.

339
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:45,861
Ashlee Breckway.

340
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:47,429
She has a thing for you.

341
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:48,963
How old is she?

342
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:50,798
She's 16.

343
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,134
- Sixteen?
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:27:53,136 --> 00:27:54,838
Forget it.

345
00:28:18,028 --> 00:28:20,194
Looking for something?

346
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:22,430
I was just
putting it back.

347
00:28:22,432 --> 00:28:24,999
I came by the house
last week.

348
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:26,434
Did Amber tell you?

349
00:28:26,436 --> 00:28:28,202
Yeah.

350
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:30,471
Thanks for the stuff
you brought.

351
00:28:30,473 --> 00:28:32,976
Did you look at the book?

352
00:28:34,411 --> 00:28:37,546
I like the Pierre Bonnard
painting,

353
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:40,783
Earthly Paradise.

354
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,383
It's supposed to be
Adam and Eve, right?

355
00:28:42,385 --> 00:28:45,022
Yeah, right.
What'd you think?

356
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,390
It's pretty accurate.

357
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:53,528
Eve all relaxed,
laying in the woods.

358
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,966
Adam trying to figure out
where to build a house.

359
00:28:57,968 --> 00:29:00,434
Why would you say
that was accurate?

360
00:29:00,436 --> 00:29:02,437
I don't know.

361
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:04,539
I guess women are better
at accepting things

362
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,240
the way they are,

363
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:08,844
while men are always trying
to figure out ways

364
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:10,414
to change things.

365
00:29:12,415 --> 00:29:14,519
You're very insightful.

366
00:29:15,952 --> 00:29:17,821
Has anyone ever
told you that?

367
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:24,892
I'll let you
get back to work.

368
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:26,798
See you around.

369
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,549
- Uncle Mike.
- Hey, Harley.

370
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:52,054
- Uncle Mike.
- There's my favorite girl.

371
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,255
Hey, sweetheart.

372
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:56,290
Oh, you're getting heavy.
How are you?

373
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:58,026
- Good.
- You want a candy bar?

374
00:29:58,028 --> 00:29:59,428
You know where it is?

375
00:30:00,897 --> 00:30:02,197
You're adorable.

376
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:04,369
All right,
get out of here.

377
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,240
You look like you're going
to kiss me, for Christ's sakes.

378
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,412
You... you get a new couch?

379
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:17,411
Yeah, thinking about it.

380
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:20,047
Most people wait
till they have the new one

381
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:22,220
before they burn the old one,
but...

382
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:24,955
Yeah, all right.

383
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:29,892
Yeah, you...

384
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,259
you're going
to have to get

385
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:34,563
to that soffit and fascia
this year, hmm?

386
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:36,430
And that window trim?

387
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:38,467
You're going to need a new coat
of paint on that,

388
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:41,272
or that wood's just going
to rot right out of there.

389
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,539
You need to fix
your roof.

390
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:47,477
Tomorrow.

391
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:53,047
- Hey, Uncle Mike.
- Hey there, baby girl.

392
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:54,315
How are you?

393
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:55,886
Good.

394
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,357
- How's Aunt Jan?
- She's doing great.

395
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,027
- How about Mike Junior?
- He's doing fantastic.

396
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:09,463
He's just tearing it up there
in Ardendale University.

397
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:12,236
You got a minute?
Do you want to...?

398
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:26,614
He can run
and catch a ball.

399
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:31,889
What's so funny?

400
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,523
Kill...

401
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,624
have intercourse.

402
00:31:38,394 --> 00:31:41,098
Yeah, I'm going to leave you two
to your private joke.

403
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,599
Come on, Uncle Mike.

404
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:46,304
We're just kidding.

405
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:57,245
You know, a lot of people
are jealous of Mike's success,

406
00:31:57,247 --> 00:32:01,149
and that's how they handle it,
they make fun of him.

407
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:02,616
I don't come here for me.

408
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:19,066
Who needs him?

409
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:20,504
I need him.

410
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:58,834
Callie. Callie!

411
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,434
Please, help me.

412
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:02,639
Harley, is that you?

413
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,606
Are you okay?

414
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,508
What's going on?
What happened to your face?

415
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,311
Help me. I can't breathe.

416
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,878
Are you okay?

417
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,451
- Harley. Hey.
- I can't breathe.

418
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:21,322
Where are you going?

419
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:22,692
Harley.

420
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:53,787
Not too hard.

421
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:56,094
You're going to pull me so hard.

422
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:20,785
It's okay.

423
00:35:24,788 --> 00:35:26,657
It's okay.

424
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:32,387
Shit!

425
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:34,521
- Why'd you do that?
- What the hell are you doing?

426
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:36,891
I was trying to shoot a rabbit.
I figured you'd be happy.

427
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:38,459
You're not allowed
to use my gun.

428
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:40,262
- Why not?
- Because you're just a kid.

429
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,597
So what? I started hunting
with Dad when I was eight.

430
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,733
Besides, I'm not a kid anymore.
I started my period.

431
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,767
Fuck. Don't tell me that.
Tell Amber.

432
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:49,704
I did. She threw a box
of tampons at me.

433
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:51,809
Oh, my God.

434
00:37:13,963 --> 00:37:15,532
Jody?

435
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:26,244
What is that?

436
00:37:28,344 --> 00:37:30,445
What is that?

437
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:33,416
It was Misty's.
I found it in the woods.

438
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:43,893
Okay, let's go find the car.

439
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:47,362
Hey, look, it's Harley!

440
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:48,963
- Hey.
- Hey.

441
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:50,465
Come on, guys.

442
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:51,833
Can I help you
with your groceries?

443
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,735
Oh, that's okay.
You don't have to do that.

444
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:56,037
- Well, it's kind of my job.
- Oh, yeah. Okay, great.

445
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,572
Sorry. Thanks.

446
00:37:57,574 --> 00:37:59,807
Come on,
let's go to the car.

447
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:01,742
Brad's out of town
on business,

448
00:38:01,744 --> 00:38:03,744
and I didn't have anyone
to watch the kids,

449
00:38:03,746 --> 00:38:05,512
so I had them
with me tonight.

450
00:38:05,514 --> 00:38:07,882
Sorry, you don't care
about any of that.

451
00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:09,617
All right, come on.

452
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:11,422
Get in the car.

453
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:14,956
Scoot through.
Right, there you go.

454
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,858
All right.

455
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,496
Here, help me with that.
Thank you, buddy.

456
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,900
Thank you.
There you go.

457
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:29,037
Better get them home.

458
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,807
I'm sorry for the way
that I left.

459
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:36,443
Sorry for everything,
really.

460
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:38,679
I'm not saying
it wasn't great,

461
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:42,916
just maybe it shouldn't
have happened.

462
00:38:42,918 --> 00:38:45,487
You were so upset.
I just wanted to help.

463
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,458
I guess there's better ways
to help a person.

464
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,994
Or maybe not.

465
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:54,829
It's okay.

466
00:38:54,831 --> 00:38:56,563
It's not okay.

467
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:59,434
I'm married.
I have two little kids.

468
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:02,036
I'm ten years older
than you.

469
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:04,171
When I think about you,

470
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:08,108
I don't think about you being
married or how old you are.

471
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,480
What do you think about?

472
00:39:12,014 --> 00:39:14,516
- Honestly?
- Honestly.

473
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,722
Your ass, mostly.

474
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:20,921
My ass?

475
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:22,791
Yeah.

476
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,995
You think about
my ass a lot?

477
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:28,729
Define "a lot".

478
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:30,764
Once a day.

479
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:31,999
Yeah.

480
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:36,637
- Hey!
- Hey!

481
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,907
Guys, all right,
I hear you.

482
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:41,045
We're going to go
in just a second.

483
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:47,084
It's obviously not a great time
to talk about this.

484
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,485
If you want to come by
after work,

485
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:53,588
Brad's out of town,
like I said.

486
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,959
Okay.

487
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:57,958
Okay.

488
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,793
I'll see you tonight.

489
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:04,132
Okay, okay, I hear you.

490
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:07,001
Please, I beg you,
please, be nice to each other.

491
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:21,182
You have to be firm.

492
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:24,719
If a little girl steals a grape,
don't yell at her.

493
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:25,920
Let her have it.

494
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:27,554
Altmyer.

495
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:29,123
What's the deal
with your shirttail?

496
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,159
You look like hell.

497
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:32,827
Is that it?

498
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:34,729
No, that's not it.

499
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:37,565
You were late today.

500
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:39,099
Am I fired?

501
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:41,603
Jesus Christ, Altmyer.
You're not fired.

502
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,671
Just don't do it again, okay?
Can you do that?

503
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:46,608
One other thing.
I got a complaint.

504
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,209
I had a customer call.

505
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:50,979
She said you put
hair-care product

506
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,014
in the same bag
with lettuce.

507
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:55,485
What's going on
with you, son?

508
00:40:57,253 --> 00:41:01,088
Get it together.
Don't let it happen again, okay?

509
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,291
Now, tuck your shirt in.

510
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:06,230
Be proud.
Be Robinson proud.

511
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:22,946
Can I take your coat?

512
00:41:39,128 --> 00:41:41,061
Want a beer?

513
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:42,665
Sure.

514
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:57,114
You never told me
what happened last night.

515
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:06,656
Is everything okay at home?

516
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,094
Yeah.

517
00:42:15,197 --> 00:42:16,799
No.

518
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:20,703
Everything's not okay.

519
00:42:23,306 --> 00:42:26,242
Is there anything
I can do to help?

520
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,615
You can fuck me again.

521
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,166
Shit.

522
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:53,938
I'm sorry.

523
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:35,208
Harley?

524
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,680
You got to go.
I'm sorry.

525
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,280
Sorry to rush you off
like this,

526
00:43:40,282 --> 00:43:42,150
but Zack's already awake.

527
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,985
I don't know when
I can see you again,

528
00:43:43,987 --> 00:43:47,921
between the kids,
Brad and your two jobs.

529
00:43:47,923 --> 00:43:49,893
I can quit one.

530
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:54,692
Harley, what are you doing?

531
00:44:58,293 --> 00:44:59,860
Where were you?

532
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:02,028
Where were you all night?

533
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,898
We had a crisis.

534
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,534
Is Jody okay?

535
00:45:06,536 --> 00:45:08,135
Yes.

536
00:45:08,137 --> 00:45:09,369
Misty?

537
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:12,373
Yes, they're fine.

538
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,141
Where's my gun?

539
00:45:14,143 --> 00:45:16,811
I don't fucking know.
It's nothing bad like that.

540
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:18,780
You called it a crisis.

541
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,081
Maybe it's not a crisis,

542
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,016
but it's a big fucking deal,
okay?

543
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:24,552
I found a thousand dollars
in Misty's room last night.

544
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:26,554
What?

545
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:29,927
She's probably still sitting
on her bed guarding the money.

546
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:38,331
It's mine.
I'm the one who found it.

547
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:40,036
Give me the money.

548
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,070
You can't hurt me.

549
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:48,508
You're my legal guardian.
You have to take care of me.

550
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,311
I had to take it.

551
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:54,481
She was saving up to take us
and leave Daddy.

552
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:56,249
It's not yours, it's Mom's.

553
00:45:56,251 --> 00:45:58,119
And she doesn't even know
you have it.

554
00:45:58,121 --> 00:46:00,057
Now give it to me.

555
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:05,492
Okay.

556
00:46:05,494 --> 00:46:08,464
Let's ask her and see
what she wants us to do with it.

557
00:46:13,168 --> 00:46:14,869
She can't have any visitors.

558
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:16,537
You flipped out.

559
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:18,876
She can have calls.

560
00:46:21,143 --> 00:46:23,279
Now give me the money.

561
00:46:24,547 --> 00:46:26,880
You know I can take
that money from you.

562
00:46:26,882 --> 00:46:29,150
I might have to hurt you
to do it, but I can do it.

563
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:32,019
Now give it to me.

564
00:46:58,146 --> 00:47:00,648
Now I can get my license.

565
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,516
Are you crazy?

566
00:47:02,518 --> 00:47:04,985
Hmm?

567
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:07,420
You said we need
a thousand bucks.

568
00:47:07,422 --> 00:47:11,092
Yeah. I need that money
for the taxes on the house.

569
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:12,659
What are you talking about?

570
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:14,494
The taxes.

571
00:47:14,496 --> 00:47:17,632
They're due in two weeks,
and we don't have any of it.

572
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,969
Okay, and whose fault
is that?

573
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,108
Give me the money.
Give me the money.

574
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:31,211
I hate you, Harley!
You're such a fucking prick!

575
00:47:31,213 --> 00:47:33,317
I hate you!

576
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:50,164
Harley, what are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

577
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,599
You said you were going
to call me.

578
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:53,099
Why haven't you called me?

579
00:47:53,101 --> 00:47:55,336
- I didn't get a chance.
- Bullshit.

580
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:57,204
You could have called me
anytime.

581
00:47:57,206 --> 00:48:00,106
You could have said you wanted
to speak to me about Jody.

582
00:48:00,108 --> 00:48:03,010
Don't you have two jobs?

583
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:04,445
Yeah, so?

584
00:48:04,447 --> 00:48:06,313
So, the problem isn't
when can I call you,

585
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:09,650
it's when are you home
for me to talk to you?

586
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:13,086
- I usually come home for dinner.
- Oh, dinnertime, that's great.

587
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:15,356
That's when I'm cooking
and feeding two hungry kids

588
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:17,691
while my husband bitches
about his day and has a drink.

589
00:48:17,693 --> 00:48:19,961
Should I interrupt him and say,
"Hey, babe, I need to call

590
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,561
the neighbor kid and see
if he wants to come over

591
00:48:21,563 --> 00:48:24,197
so I can fuck his brains out"?
Is that what I should do?

592
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:27,169
Yeah, that's exactly
what you should do.

593
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,273
Zack is right here.

594
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:34,275
- Let's go inside.
- I can't.

595
00:48:34,277 --> 00:48:35,612
I ca...

596
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,588
Here you go, bud.

597
00:49:20,356 --> 00:49:22,655
I found this
in Esme's backpack.

598
00:49:22,657 --> 00:49:25,059
She and Jody send notes
back and forth all the time.

599
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,594
But this one
kind of concerned me.

600
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,298
I thought you should have it.

601
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,298
I asked Esme about it.

602
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,300
She said Jody was just trying
to gross her out.

603
00:49:33,302 --> 00:49:35,068
But if this is true,
it's disturbing.

604
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:39,039
You might want to talk
to Misty about it.

605
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,041
When can I see you again?

606
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:43,077
I don't know.

607
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,612
Do you know the abandoned
mining office

608
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:46,813
by the railroad tracks?

609
00:49:46,815 --> 00:49:49,986
I thought we could
go there.

610
00:49:53,456 --> 00:49:55,222
Okay.

611
00:49:55,224 --> 00:49:57,090
How about...

612
00:49:57,092 --> 00:49:58,592
Wednesday?

613
00:49:58,594 --> 00:50:01,097
I think that's the first time
I can get away.

614
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:05,768
Sure.

615
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:34,695
I want to ask you something.

616
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:36,563
And I want you to be honest.

617
00:50:36,565 --> 00:50:38,334
Okay.

618
00:50:41,336 --> 00:50:43,172
Was I your first?

619
00:50:44,507 --> 00:50:47,575
First what?

620
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,577
Woman.

621
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:54,051
Was I the first woman
you've ever had sex with?

622
00:50:59,387 --> 00:51:02,590
Harley, I'm sorry.

623
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,061
I'm sorry I didn't know
at the time.

624
00:51:06,461 --> 00:51:08,364
I hope it was memorable.

625
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:13,636
I remember it.

626
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,250
This was a good idea.

627
00:51:28,684 --> 00:51:32,186
We could do it
every Wednesday night.

628
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:34,590
- Yeah.
- Would that make you happy?

629
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:21,505
Callie?

630
00:52:36,552 --> 00:52:39,155
I have something
I want to talk to you about.

631
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,758
It's a hypothetical question.

632
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,530
Go on.

633
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:55,172
Can a kid think it's okay
to get hit?

634
00:52:58,574 --> 00:53:01,744
Did you think it was okay
for your father to hit you?

635
00:53:04,246 --> 00:53:05,945
This isn't about me.

636
00:53:05,947 --> 00:53:07,783
You can still answer
the question.

637
00:53:10,452 --> 00:53:13,190
I didn't think it was okay,
but...

638
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:18,928
I thought it was normal.

639
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:33,809
What about sexually abused kids?

640
00:53:35,043 --> 00:53:36,913
Can they think it's okay?

641
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,318
You talking about Misty?

642
00:53:44,853 --> 00:53:46,920
What do you know
about Misty?

643
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:48,688
I don't know much about her.

644
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,523
We only had a few sessions
together.

645
00:53:50,525 --> 00:53:53,327
But in the few we did,

646
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:56,496
I had the feeling she was in
a very unhealthy relationship

647
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:59,335
with your father.

648
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:12,248
Who was sexually abused, Harley?

649
00:54:18,853 --> 00:54:20,887
No one.

650
00:54:20,889 --> 00:54:23,324
What about Amber?

651
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:24,958
Amber.

652
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,561
She was never alone with Dad.
She hated him.

653
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:28,896
Yeah? How do you know?

654
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,798
I was there.

655
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,836
I saw.

656
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:36,403
How did you feel
toward Amber

657
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:39,773
when you saw her being hit
by your father?

658
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:41,008
What do you mean?

659
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,413
Did you want to help her?

660
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,889
I wanted to make her
feel better.

661
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,623
And how do you think she felt

662
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,427
when she saw your father
hit you?

663
00:55:05,668 --> 00:55:07,470
I don't know.

664
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:15,844
I guess she didn't like it.

665
00:55:18,847 --> 00:55:21,518
Did she want to make you
feel better?

666
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:29,655
It's okay, Harley.

667
00:55:29,657 --> 00:55:32,492
Harley, please do not walk away.
We need to talk about this.

668
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:35,496
Harley.

669
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:54,081
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck are you?

670
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:56,550
Amber's running away.

671
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:59,052
I asked you
who you were.

672
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:00,987
I'm a friend of Amber's.

673
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:03,523
You must be her brother.

674
00:56:03,525 --> 00:56:04,891
The bag boy.

675
00:56:04,893 --> 00:56:06,159
Don't hurt him, Harley.

676
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:08,829
- Hurt him.
- Hurt me?

677
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:11,000
Just make him go away.

678
00:56:13,168 --> 00:56:15,735
I think you should leave.

679
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:18,375
Come on, let's go.

680
00:56:23,211 --> 00:56:24,711
I'm leaving you!

681
00:56:24,713 --> 00:56:26,179
Don't touch me!
You're disgusting!

682
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:28,081
I don't want to live with you
anymore.

683
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,150
Don't go, please.

684
00:56:30,152 --> 00:56:31,617
I'm sorry, Jody.

685
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:33,153
I don't want to,
but I have to, okay?

686
00:56:33,155 --> 00:56:35,822
So be mad at Harley
because it's Harley's fault!

687
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:36,990
What did I do?

688
00:56:36,992 --> 00:56:39,525
You know exactly
what you did.

689
00:56:39,527 --> 00:56:41,461
Now can you get
out of the fucking way?

690
00:56:47,902 --> 00:56:50,670
Why did you let her go?

691
00:56:50,672 --> 00:56:53,039
- She'll be back.
- No, she won't.

692
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:55,008
Yes, she will.

693
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,211
That boy only wants one thing
from her, okay?

694
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,979
And when he gets it,

695
00:56:58,981 --> 00:57:01,481
he's going to dump her
in a parking lot somewhere.

696
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:02,916
Does he want her pillow?

697
00:57:02,918 --> 00:57:04,617
Yeah, he wants
her pillow.

698
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:07,688
Will you get her
in the parking lot?

699
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,222
I will, I promise you.

700
00:57:09,224 --> 00:57:10,824
Promise?

701
00:57:10,826 --> 00:57:12,728
I promise.

702
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:27,206
This is all Misty's fault.

703
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:29,208
Why do you say that?

704
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:33,579
She told Amber something today,
and it made her really mad.

705
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:34,780
What did she tell her?

706
00:57:34,782 --> 00:57:36,215
I don't know.

707
00:57:36,217 --> 00:57:37,985
They went in her room
and closed the door.

708
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,186
It was about you, though.

709
00:57:39,188 --> 00:57:42,623
I heard your name
a bunch of times.

710
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,925
I asked Misty to tell me,
but she said it was a secret.

711
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:48,729
Misty keeps secrets
better than anybody.

712
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,630
She said I won't be able
to keep it,

713
00:57:50,632 --> 00:57:53,166
but I keep lots of secrets
for her.

714
00:57:53,168 --> 00:57:55,269
Like what?

715
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,704
I can't tell you.
They're secrets.

716
00:57:57,706 --> 00:58:00,606
You know, when Misty tells you
you can't tell anyone,

717
00:58:00,608 --> 00:58:02,742
she's not talking about me.

718
00:58:02,744 --> 00:58:04,146
Yes, she is.

719
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:08,782
Did Misty ask you
to keep a secret

720
00:58:08,784 --> 00:58:10,650
about that shirt of hers
you found?

721
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:12,286
No.

722
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:15,588
But you know something about it
and you won't tell me.

723
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,257
Why?

724
00:58:17,259 --> 00:58:19,128
Mm...

725
00:58:22,197 --> 00:58:24,901
Where did all that blood
come from?

726
00:58:27,235 --> 00:58:29,702
From Daddy, I guess.

727
00:58:29,704 --> 00:58:33,039
But Misty was at the mall
when Daddy got shot.

728
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:35,008
You were the only one home
that night

729
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,213
with Mommy and Daddy,
remember?

730
00:58:38,713 --> 00:58:40,112
Misty was at the mall.

731
00:58:40,114 --> 00:58:42,349
I know.
Mommy drove her there.

732
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:45,719
When did Mommy
drive her there?

733
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:47,186
After she shot Daddy.

734
00:58:47,188 --> 00:58:48,789
- Who shot Daddy?
- Mommy.

735
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,994
Everybody knows that.

736
00:58:52,327 --> 00:58:54,061
Did you see it happen?

737
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:55,762
You know I didn't.

738
00:58:55,764 --> 00:58:57,898
I was in my room,
I heard a bang,

739
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,633
and I went out
and I saw Daddy on the floor,

740
00:59:00,635 --> 00:59:02,838
and I went and hid
in the woods.

741
00:59:09,043 --> 00:59:10,844
But Misty was there?

742
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:13,713
She was hugging Daddy.

743
00:59:13,715 --> 00:59:16,682
And then you saw Mommy
drive away with Misty.

744
00:59:16,684 --> 00:59:18,153
Yeah.

745
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:22,356
What did Mommy do
when she got back?

746
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,891
She got a shovel
and went in the woods.

747
00:59:24,893 --> 00:59:27,260
I thought she was going
to bury Daddy.

748
00:59:27,262 --> 00:59:29,162
But she buried Misty's shirt
instead.

749
00:59:29,164 --> 00:59:30,833
Yeah.

750
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:36,737
Why didn't you tell the police
Misty was home that night?

751
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,405
They didn't ask me.

752
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:41,878
They just asked me if I saw
Mommy shoot Daddy, and I didn't.

753
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:54,987
Hi, Betty.

754
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:56,657
This is Harley Altmyer.

755
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,391
I'm sorry to call you
on a Saturday,

756
00:59:58,393 --> 01:00:01,695
but I really need
to see my mom.

757
01:00:01,697 --> 01:00:05,865
The problem is I'm not allowed
to see her anymore.

758
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:08,003
I thought maybe
you could get me in.

759
01:00:10,204 --> 01:00:13,342
Maybe you could tell them
it would be good for me.

760
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:38,800
How is everything at home?

761
01:00:41,302 --> 01:00:45,271
Nobody's shot anybody,
if that's what you're asking.

762
01:00:45,273 --> 01:00:49,275
That supposed
to be funny?

763
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:51,146
It wasn't.

764
01:00:54,148 --> 01:00:57,016
What's wrong?

765
01:00:57,018 --> 01:00:58,284
Hmm?

766
01:00:58,286 --> 01:01:00,820
You look sick, baby.

767
01:01:00,822 --> 01:01:02,958
I'm fine.

768
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:08,295
You're not taking care
of yourself.

769
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:12,164
When was the last time you slept
or changed your clothes?

770
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:15,168
Did you know
Misty took your money?

771
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,137
The thousand dollars
you had saved up.

772
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:19,005
Did you know she took it?

773
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:22,311
Amber found it
last week.

774
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,213
Did you know about it?

775
01:01:28,483 --> 01:01:33,253
I thought your dad
had taken that money.

776
01:01:33,255 --> 01:01:35,057
He didn't.

777
01:01:37,492 --> 01:01:39,291
Mom.

778
01:01:39,293 --> 01:01:41,998
Mom, the money.

779
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,471
Well, I guess
it'll come in handy.

780
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:51,371
Fine.

781
01:01:51,373 --> 01:01:54,143
Don't talk to me,
but then I'm done.

782
01:01:55,844 --> 01:01:57,543
What do you mean?

783
01:01:57,545 --> 01:02:01,782
I'm done. Done taking care
of your fucking kids.

784
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:03,784
I'm packing up my shit
and I'm leaving.

785
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,017
You would never.

786
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:07,554
You'd never leave the girls.

787
01:02:07,556 --> 01:02:09,121
Why not?

788
01:02:09,123 --> 01:02:11,291
You did.

789
01:02:11,293 --> 01:02:13,325
What are you talking about?

790
01:02:13,327 --> 01:02:16,496
I didn't leave anyone
on purpose.

791
01:02:16,498 --> 01:02:19,833
Look around you.
I'm in prison!

792
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:22,304
You fucking like it here.

793
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:25,807
Hmm?

794
01:02:29,143 --> 01:02:32,878
You're talking stupid, okay?

795
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,880
I don't love them.

796
01:02:34,882 --> 01:02:38,351
I don't feel any obligation
to them.

797
01:02:38,353 --> 01:02:40,990
It's not my job.

798
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,896
Okay.

799
01:02:49,498 --> 01:02:52,566
Okay, Harley.

800
01:02:54,503 --> 01:02:56,239
Okay.

801
01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:00,273
Misty took the money.

802
01:03:00,275 --> 01:03:03,510
What do you want me
to tell you?

803
01:03:03,512 --> 01:03:05,278
I was...

804
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,313
I was saving it up

805
01:03:07,315 --> 01:03:11,284
and I was going to leave
your dad, okay?

806
01:03:11,286 --> 01:03:13,353
I was.

807
01:03:13,355 --> 01:03:16,925
What was going on
between Dad and Misty?

808
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:25,100
I don't know
what you mean.

809
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:29,401
Please, tell me the truth.

810
01:03:29,403 --> 01:03:31,070
You owe me.

811
01:03:31,072 --> 01:03:33,340
I don't...

812
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,608
I don't.

813
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,575
I don't owe you anything.

814
01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:40,112
Fucking tell me.
Fucking tell me.

815
01:03:40,114 --> 01:03:42,818
I never saw anything.

816
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,923
Did you ask Dad?

817
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:51,258
- Hmm?
- I don't...

818
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,592
How do you ask?

819
01:03:52,594 --> 01:03:55,095
How do you ask
a question like that?

820
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,966
You asked Misty.

821
01:03:58,432 --> 01:04:00,133
What? If he what?

822
01:04:00,135 --> 01:04:04,037
How do you ask anybody
a question like that?

823
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:06,275
So, you never knew anything
for sure?

824
01:04:08,976 --> 01:04:10,879
I found her shirt.

825
01:04:12,581 --> 01:04:14,347
- I know she was there.
- What?

826
01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:17,450
I know she did it.
I know Misty killed Dad.

827
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:19,385
I don't get it.

828
01:04:19,387 --> 01:04:22,322
You didn't have
to take the blame.

829
01:04:22,324 --> 01:04:24,124
Nothing would have
happened to you.

830
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,659
- You don't understand.
- She's just a kid.

831
01:04:26,661 --> 01:04:30,165
You don't understand,
Harley.

832
01:04:31,565 --> 01:04:33,499
She wouldn't have
gotten in trouble.

833
01:04:33,501 --> 01:04:35,367
She would have gotten help.

834
01:04:35,369 --> 01:04:38,204
- She needs help.
- You don't understand.

835
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:39,673
Were you embarrassed?

836
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:42,708
You didn't want
anyone to know?

837
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:46,079
Misty didn't want
your dad dead!

838
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,380
Is that why you said
you fucking did it?

839
01:04:48,382 --> 01:04:50,083
She...

840
01:04:50,085 --> 01:04:52,351
She was aiming it at me!

841
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:55,188
She was jealous of me!

842
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:59,461
She was trying to kill me
and he got in the way!

843
01:05:01,996 --> 01:05:04,396
You're fucking crazy.

844
01:05:04,398 --> 01:05:07,032
You're crazy.

845
01:05:07,034 --> 01:05:09,202
I'm not the crazy one!

846
01:05:09,204 --> 01:05:10,637
I'm not!

847
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:12,438
You're fucking
hiding in here.

848
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,641
You're fucking hiding in here.
Why did you leave me?

849
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:17,010
- That's it.
- I'm not hiding!

850
01:05:17,012 --> 01:05:18,677
Come on.

851
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:20,280
I just want my mom.

852
01:05:20,282 --> 01:05:22,385
I want my fucking mom!

853
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:45,738
Hi, Harley.

854
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,443
Amber came back.

855
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,748
This is temporary.

856
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,749
I'm not going to live with you
anymore.

857
01:05:56,751 --> 01:05:59,318
I'm moving in with Dylan.

858
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,692
Did he do that
to your face?

859
01:06:05,793 --> 01:06:08,061
Hmm?

860
01:06:08,063 --> 01:06:12,065
Why do you give yourself
to assholes like that?

861
01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:14,536
You don't even make them
work for it.

862
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:17,739
They want me.

863
01:07:23,804 --> 01:07:25,871
Let's get something straight,
Harley.

864
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:29,575
You don't ever come to my house
when Brad's around.

865
01:07:29,577 --> 01:07:31,478
I came to pick up Jody.

866
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,246
You didn't come to pick up Jody.
Brad took Jody home hours ago.

867
01:07:34,248 --> 01:07:35,581
You came to make a scene.

868
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,217
And what do you want me
to tell Brad

869
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,119
when he asks
why I had to come out here,

870
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:40,452
why you had to talk to me,

871
01:07:40,454 --> 01:07:41,820
why I had to sit here
in your truck?

872
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:44,389
And don't tell me
to tell him the truth.

873
01:07:45,893 --> 01:07:50,295
- Where'd you go today?
- I went shopping.

874
01:07:50,297 --> 01:07:52,599
- Where'd you go Thursday?
- To the fucking library.

875
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:53,900
What is this?

876
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:55,901
Why are you asking me
where I've been?

877
01:07:55,903 --> 01:07:59,208
Where I go is none
of your business!

878
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:03,546
I wanted to make sure
you weren't mad at me.

879
01:08:05,847 --> 01:08:07,646
Mad at you for what?

880
01:08:07,648 --> 01:08:10,282
You left.

881
01:08:10,284 --> 01:08:12,454
When? Wednesday?

882
01:08:15,322 --> 01:08:18,525
You knew I had to leave.

883
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:20,360
Do you think we could
do it sometime

884
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,594
when you didn't
have to leave?

885
01:08:22,596 --> 01:08:26,398
Why did you really
come here?

886
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,634
Did you really think
I was going to come out here

887
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:30,269
and give you what you wanted

888
01:08:30,271 --> 01:08:32,541
while my husband and kids
were sitting inside?

889
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:36,776
I'm not going
to fuck up my family.

890
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:38,814
I'm not going to do it.

891
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:41,750
Do you understand?

892
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:45,250
Do you understand?

893
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:47,422
But I love you.

894
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,729
Let's just...

895
01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:59,467
stick to the mining office
like we planned.

896
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,439
Okay.

897
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:14,250
I'll see you Wednesday.

898
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,662
Altmyer.

899
01:09:30,664 --> 01:09:33,700
Man, do not come back here
until you take a bath.

900
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:38,638
Oh, God, Jesus.

901
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,342
Whoo.

902
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,403
I was going
to leave you a note,

903
01:10:11,405 --> 01:10:12,972
but I thought it was
a big enough deal

904
01:10:12,974 --> 01:10:15,708
that I should say bye to you
in person.

905
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:17,977
Who's watching Jody?

906
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:20,345
Fuck you. I'm standing here
telling you

907
01:10:20,347 --> 01:10:21,848
I'm never going
to see you again,

908
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,384
and all you care about
is who's watching Jody.

909
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:27,519
Misty's watching her.

910
01:10:27,521 --> 01:10:29,621
I don't like Misty
watching Jody.

911
01:10:29,623 --> 01:10:31,057
Well, that's too fucking bad,

912
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:33,896
because that's all you got
anymore.

913
01:10:35,396 --> 01:10:37,929
Where are you going?

914
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:40,566
I'm moving in
with Dylan.

915
01:10:40,568 --> 01:10:41,968
I'm serious.

916
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:45,374
He's way different
from all the other guys.

917
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,508
Why?

918
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,412
Because he hits you?

919
01:10:51,979 --> 01:10:54,382
Is that what you want?
Someone to hit you?

920
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:59,751
I don't get it.

921
01:10:59,753 --> 01:11:02,655
You didn't like it
when Dad hit you.

922
01:11:02,657 --> 01:11:04,693
Or did you?

923
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,496
You're sick.

924
01:11:08,662 --> 01:11:10,832
Would you stay if I hit you?

925
01:11:15,036 --> 01:11:17,472
Well, do you want me to stay?

926
01:11:18,806 --> 01:11:20,339
If you want.

927
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:23,411
Well, are you
asking me to stay?

928
01:11:26,547 --> 01:11:29,581
Till you figure things out,
sure.

929
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:33,986
Well, Dylan will be really mad
if I stay.

930
01:11:33,988 --> 01:11:35,455
For Christ's sakes, Amber.

931
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,923
Tell him I won't let you.

932
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:39,728
Really? You want me
to tell him that?

933
01:11:41,796 --> 01:11:43,432
Yeah.

934
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,869
Okay.

935
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:39,847
Fuck.

936
01:13:42,884 --> 01:13:45,585
- Fuck.
- What's wrong?

937
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,687
Fuck. Put some fucking
clothes on.

938
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,621
You were liking it.

939
01:13:49,623 --> 01:13:51,057
Put some clothes on.

940
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:53,526
You said you wanted me to stay.

941
01:13:53,528 --> 01:13:56,062
Get off me. Get off me.

942
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,897
Fucking get off me!

943
01:13:57,899 --> 01:14:00,068
What's wrong with you?

944
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:09,842
You thought it was her.

945
01:14:09,844 --> 01:14:12,711
You thought you were
fucking her.

946
01:14:18,653 --> 01:14:20,887
I know all about it!

947
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:25,124
I know all about you and her
in that fucking shed!

948
01:14:33,967 --> 01:14:36,171
She doesn't love you.

949
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:40,741
She doesn't love you!

950
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,581
She could never love you.

951
01:14:51,618 --> 01:14:54,856
Amber used to touch me
when we were kids.

952
01:14:56,323 --> 01:14:59,724
I remember.

953
01:14:59,726 --> 01:15:02,663
She used to come into bed
with me and touch me.

954
01:15:04,231 --> 01:15:06,167
Where did she touch you?

955
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:12,170
You need to say it,
Harley.

956
01:15:12,172 --> 01:15:15,708
You need to say it in order
to confront it

957
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:17,880
so it can go away.

958
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:23,715
It's not ever
going to go away.

959
01:15:23,717 --> 01:15:26,619
It can fade
to almost nothing.

960
01:15:26,621 --> 01:15:28,556
It can, I promise.

961
01:15:30,358 --> 01:15:32,561
She touched you where?

962
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,634
My penis.

963
01:15:41,636 --> 01:15:43,635
Did you touch her?

964
01:15:43,637 --> 01:15:44,970
No.

965
01:15:44,972 --> 01:15:46,774
She was behind me.

966
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:50,977
She came into my bed.

967
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:53,981
Why do you think
she came into your bed?

968
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,249
Hmm?

969
01:15:58,819 --> 01:16:00,188
Think about it.

970
01:16:02,222 --> 01:16:04,690
She was afraid of Dad.

971
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,828
And you let her stay?

972
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:12,634
- Why?
- I was afraid of him too.

973
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:22,911
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harley.

974
01:16:25,012 --> 01:16:30,148
You are not a bad person.

975
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:33,385
There is nothing wrong
with you or Amber.

976
01:16:33,387 --> 01:16:36,755
You were children
reacting to abuse

977
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:39,025
the only way you knew how:

978
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,762
by turning to each other
for comfort.

979
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:54,339
What made you remember?

980
01:16:54,341 --> 01:16:56,075
Do you know?

981
01:16:56,077 --> 01:16:58,076
Did something happen?

982
01:16:58,078 --> 01:17:01,013
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

983
01:17:01,015 --> 01:17:04,383
- You can.
- No, I can't.

984
01:17:04,385 --> 01:17:06,184
You can.

985
01:17:06,186 --> 01:17:08,687
What happened?

986
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:13,692
She was in bed with me
and I was sleeping.

987
01:17:13,694 --> 01:17:15,027
When?

988
01:17:15,029 --> 01:17:16,832
Last night.

989
01:17:18,966 --> 01:17:21,103
Did she touch you?

990
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:26,972
I don't know.

991
01:17:26,974 --> 01:17:29,744
I was sleeping,
and she...

992
01:17:31,112 --> 01:17:33,715
she didn't have
any clothes on.

993
01:17:35,182 --> 01:17:37,049
How did you react?

994
01:17:37,051 --> 01:17:38,983
What do you mean?

995
01:17:38,985 --> 01:17:41,219
What kind of question is that?
I'm not...

996
01:17:41,221 --> 01:17:42,353
I'm not sick.

997
01:17:42,355 --> 01:17:45,156
I am not implying you are.

998
01:17:45,158 --> 01:17:48,427
I'm thinking
about Amber now.

999
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:51,397
I'm concerned about
how she might be feeling.

1000
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:52,932
This was all her fault.

1001
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,433
She was the one
who wanted to do it.

1002
01:17:54,435 --> 01:17:55,934
No, she didn't want to do it.

1003
01:17:55,936 --> 01:17:59,205
- She did.
- Harley, try to understand.

1004
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:03,209
Your sister
isn't the villain here.

1005
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:06,847
She is suffering
just as much as you are.

1006
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:12,218
Where's Amber right now?

1007
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,222
I don't know.

1008
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:17,857
It doesn't matter.

1009
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:21,794
She can take care
of herself.

1010
01:18:21,796 --> 01:18:25,701
Right now, you're feeling
shame and guilt.

1011
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,067
Amber is feeling all that,

1012
01:18:28,069 --> 01:18:31,807
but she's also
feeling rejected.

1013
01:18:34,775 --> 01:18:37,276
I want you to lie down
on the couch here

1014
01:18:37,278 --> 01:18:39,410
and get some rest.

1015
01:18:39,412 --> 01:18:41,213
My jobs.

1016
01:18:41,215 --> 01:18:42,548
Don't worry.

1017
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:45,387
I'll take care
of everything.

1018
01:19:44,845 --> 01:19:47,148
I heard your fight
with Amber.

1019
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:53,952
What did you hear?

1020
01:19:53,954 --> 01:19:56,187
I heard you
screaming at her

1021
01:19:56,189 --> 01:19:59,560
and telling her
to put her clothes back on.

1022
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:05,533
Look, I don't care
what you and Amber do.

1023
01:20:08,034 --> 01:20:10,870
We're not that different,
you know.

1024
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:13,041
The way we think.

1025
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,308
We're both sort of weird.

1026
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:20,245
I'm not really the way
a girl's supposed to be,

1027
01:20:20,247 --> 01:20:23,951
and you're not really the way
a guy's supposed to be.

1028
01:20:26,186 --> 01:20:29,220
What do you mean?

1029
01:20:29,222 --> 01:20:30,623
I mean, you hate sports

1030
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,558
and you keep that art book
in your truck.

1031
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,661
There's nothing wrong
with a guy liking art.

1032
01:20:36,663 --> 01:20:40,499
And there's nothing wrong
with a girl liking to hunt.

1033
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:42,470
Nobody said there was.

1034
01:20:44,604 --> 01:20:47,639
Dad thought there was.

1035
01:20:47,641 --> 01:20:49,407
Dad loved taking you hunting.

1036
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:51,445
No, he didn't.

1037
01:20:52,613 --> 01:20:55,179
He took me
because I wanted to go.

1038
01:20:55,181 --> 01:20:58,619
But he always wished
that I was you.

1039
01:21:01,488 --> 01:21:03,187
He loved you.

1040
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:04,990
No, he didn't.

1041
01:21:04,992 --> 01:21:08,163
He didn't love me
like he loved Mom.

1042
01:21:09,363 --> 01:21:11,566
That's a different
kind of love.

1043
01:21:14,068 --> 01:21:15,604
He never hit her.

1044
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:20,406
Did you ever
think about that?

1045
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,410
He never touched her.

1046
01:21:24,945 --> 01:21:28,315
That's probably why
she didn't care that he hit us.

1047
01:21:31,418 --> 01:21:33,255
She cared.

1048
01:21:35,021 --> 01:21:37,458
Then why didn't she try
to stop him?

1049
01:21:41,962 --> 01:21:44,064
I know what you did.

1050
01:21:47,201 --> 01:21:49,237
I know the truth.

1051
01:21:59,613 --> 01:22:02,714
Don't you have
anything to say?

1052
01:22:02,716 --> 01:22:05,653
You're the one
that should have done it.

1053
01:22:21,534 --> 01:22:23,402
Hi, this is Dr. Parks.

1054
01:22:23,404 --> 01:22:25,336
It's Wednesday, 7:00 p.m.

1055
01:22:25,338 --> 01:22:27,339
I'm at my home office.

1056
01:22:27,341 --> 01:22:30,142
Amber. Amber?

1057
01:22:30,144 --> 01:22:33,144
If you're there,
please, call me back.

1058
01:23:59,332 --> 01:24:02,103
I didn't know
what else to do.

1059
01:24:11,511 --> 01:24:12,777
What about me?

1060
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:15,349
Who's going to take care of me?

1061
01:24:29,229 --> 01:24:32,263
So, this woman.

1062
01:24:32,265 --> 01:24:34,402
How do you know her?

1063
01:24:40,373 --> 01:24:42,810
She's a neighbor.

1064
01:24:44,478 --> 01:24:47,812
Jody plays with her kid.

1065
01:24:47,814 --> 01:24:50,616
Is Jody the little one
we found hiding in the woods

1066
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,388
the night your daddy was shot?

1067
01:24:55,788 --> 01:24:57,255
Yeah.

1068
01:24:57,257 --> 01:24:59,626
She's the little one.

1069
01:25:11,505 --> 01:25:14,606
I want to make a call.

1070
01:25:14,608 --> 01:25:16,909
We're not done yet.

1071
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:20,148
I get one phone call,
and I want to make it now.

1072
01:25:24,918 --> 01:25:26,384
All right.

1073
01:25:26,386 --> 01:25:27,785
Go ahead.

1074
01:25:27,787 --> 01:25:29,590
Make your phone call.

1075
01:25:47,841 --> 01:25:49,575
Hello?

1076
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:51,779
Uncle Mike?

1077
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:55,283
It's me, Harley.

1078
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:58,817
I want to talk to Jody.

1079
01:25:58,819 --> 01:26:00,652
Jody?

1080
01:26:00,654 --> 01:26:04,423
Jody's in bed asleep.

1081
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:06,657
What are you doing
calling here?

1082
01:26:06,659 --> 01:26:08,360
I get one call.

1083
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:11,530
This is your
one phone call?

1084
01:26:12,966 --> 01:26:14,732
Yeah.

1085
01:26:14,734 --> 01:26:16,768
Jesus, Harley.

1086
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:20,671
They might give you
the death penalty for this.

1087
01:26:26,546 --> 01:26:28,780
Right.

1088
01:26:28,782 --> 01:26:30,418
I know.

1089
01:26:31,652 --> 01:26:33,384
You get one phone call,

1090
01:26:33,386 --> 01:26:36,456
and you call a six-year-old
little girl.

1091
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:43,664
Uncle Mike.

1092
01:26:45,298 --> 01:26:46,900
Uncle Mike.

1093
01:26:48,368 --> 01:26:50,835
I'm sorry.
I can't wake her.

1094
01:26:57,944 --> 01:27:00,715
You know much
about guns, Harley?

1095
01:27:02,048 --> 01:27:03,784
Some.

1096
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:07,885
Enough to know how powerful
that rifle of yours is,

1097
01:27:07,887 --> 01:27:10,925
and the damage it can cause
at close range?

1098
01:27:12,859 --> 01:27:16,628
So, my question to you is,

1099
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:20,598
why didn't you shoot her
from a distance?

1100
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,535
You got a nice scope
on that rifle.

1101
01:27:23,537 --> 01:27:27,071
You could have climbed up
those hills behind her house

1102
01:27:27,073 --> 01:27:28,674
and shot her
in the front yard

1103
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:30,741
and said it was
a hunting accident,

1104
01:27:30,743 --> 01:27:33,445
and no one would have
suspected anything,

1105
01:27:33,447 --> 01:27:35,613
because no one knew
there was anything going on

1106
01:27:35,615 --> 01:27:38,383
between you two,
right?

1107
01:27:38,385 --> 01:27:40,688
Her husband didn't know.

1108
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,792
Did you tell him?

1109
01:27:45,993 --> 01:27:47,662
No.

1110
01:27:49,529 --> 01:27:54,098
But I did talk with him
when we retrieved the body.

1111
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:59,039
And he said you liked her,
and she was fond of you.

1112
01:28:03,810 --> 01:28:05,579
I want to go to jail.

1113
01:28:12,118 --> 01:28:14,919
Fair enough.

1114
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:17,491
I just have one more question
for you.

1115
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,530
- Okay.
- Why did you kill her?

1116
01:28:28,735 --> 01:28:31,469
What do you mean?

1117
01:28:31,471 --> 01:28:33,807
You loved her, right?

1118
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:37,675
Yeah.

1119
01:28:37,677 --> 01:28:39,811
Well, I'm not saying
people that love each other

1120
01:28:39,813 --> 01:28:42,013
don't kill each other,
but they usually think

1121
01:28:42,015 --> 01:28:44,952
they have a pretty good reason
for doing it.

1122
01:28:46,953 --> 01:28:50,388
I wanted her to leave
her husband

1123
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:53,427
and she said
she wouldn't.

1124
01:28:54,661 --> 01:28:56,564
So you killed her?

1125
01:29:03,804 --> 01:29:06,905
Okay, let me see if I can
get this straight here.

1126
01:29:06,907 --> 01:29:08,876
You...

1127
01:29:10,743 --> 01:29:13,711
you're going to meet with her
to have sex with her,

1128
01:29:13,713 --> 01:29:15,714
and you decide to kill her.

1129
01:29:15,716 --> 01:29:17,749
Then you throw up
next to her body,

1130
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:20,986
and you fold her hands
peacefully across her chest,

1131
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:23,455
you drive yourself
to the police station

1132
01:29:23,457 --> 01:29:25,723
and give us a nice,
neat confession.

1133
01:29:25,725 --> 01:29:28,626
And then you call your baby
sister to see how she's doing.

1134
01:29:28,628 --> 01:29:30,064
Is that about right?

1135
01:29:35,502 --> 01:29:37,535
The only problem
with that is,

1136
01:29:37,537 --> 01:29:40,871
is you're talking about
two people.

1137
01:29:40,873 --> 01:29:44,976
One is a cold-blooded
psychopath

1138
01:29:44,978 --> 01:29:50,885
and the other is a decent kid
that's just had a shitty life.

1139
01:29:53,086 --> 01:29:55,823
Can you explain to me
how you could be both?

1140
01:29:58,158 --> 01:30:00,661
I have a split personality.

1141
01:30:07,134 --> 01:30:10,538
And that's why
you see the shrink.

1142
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:15,609
I want to go to jail now.

1143
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:33,461
Are you ready, ma'am?

1144
01:30:59,252 --> 01:31:01,154
Hi, Harley.

1145
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:06,927
How are you doing?

1146
01:31:08,561 --> 01:31:10,064
Good.

1147
01:31:11,965 --> 01:31:15,567
Are you sleeping?

1148
01:31:15,569 --> 01:31:17,505
I'm fine.

1149
01:31:19,072 --> 01:31:21,007
How are the girls?

1150
01:31:22,542 --> 01:31:25,212
They're adjusting.

1151
01:31:26,646 --> 01:31:28,783
Did you get
Jody's letter?

1152
01:31:36,256 --> 01:31:39,691
I came to see
how you were doing.

1153
01:31:39,693 --> 01:31:41,195
I hope that's okay?

1154
01:31:43,863 --> 01:31:45,964
Is it still
part of your job?

1155
01:31:45,966 --> 01:31:48,666
No.

1156
01:31:48,668 --> 01:31:50,704
No, I guess it isn't.

1157
01:31:51,971 --> 01:31:53,907
Then why are you here?

1158
01:31:56,909 --> 01:32:01,245
Because, Harley,
truthfully,

1159
01:32:01,247 --> 01:32:04,182
what you are doing

1160
01:32:04,184 --> 01:32:07,852
is sacrificing yourself
for someone.

1161
01:32:07,854 --> 01:32:09,720
Am I correct?

1162
01:32:09,722 --> 01:32:12,324
Because I have reason
to doubt the account

1163
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:15,093
that you gave
in your statement.

1164
01:32:15,095 --> 01:32:17,329
And because I believe

1165
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:21,665
that even though you have
been through more than most,

1166
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:24,738
you are not a murderer.

1167
01:32:31,877 --> 01:32:34,111
Is there anything
you want to tell me, Harley?

1168
01:32:34,113 --> 01:32:36,616
Anything at all?

1169
01:32:42,154 --> 01:32:45,158
I thought you came to see me
because you cared about me.

1170
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:48,626
That's the truth.

1171
01:32:48,628 --> 01:32:51,032
I do care about you.

1172
01:32:52,899 --> 01:32:56,570
But I can't help you
if you won't let me.

1173
01:32:59,972 --> 01:33:02,208
Then I'm sorry
I've wasted your time.

1174
01:33:03,676 --> 01:33:05,777
I know who you are.

1175
01:33:05,779 --> 01:33:08,583
You don't belong here.

1176
01:33:15,255 --> 01:33:16,888
Yes, I do.

1177
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:19,324
No!

1178
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:32,036
Harley! Harley!

1179
01:33:54,828 --> 01:33:56,428
Dear Harley,

1180
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:58,830
how are you?

1181
01:33:58,832 --> 01:34:01,398
I am fine.

1182
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:04,169
Amber and Misty
are fine too.

1183
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:08,305
Uncle Mike let me bring
all my dinosaurs to his house.

1184
01:34:08,307 --> 01:34:10,407
Amber has her own room.

1185
01:34:10,409 --> 01:34:13,911
I still have to share
with Misty.

1186
01:34:13,913 --> 01:34:16,817
I hope you will
come back soon.

1187
01:34:18,819 --> 01:34:20,852
I miss my life.

1188
01:34:20,854 --> 01:34:23,324
Your sister, Jody.

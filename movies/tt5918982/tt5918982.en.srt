3
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,414
Holly. Holly? Where've you been?

4
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:02,969
He's been here 20 minutes.

5
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:05,705
When we get to the lounge, I'll
walk first and introduce you.

6
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:10,109
Kiss him once on each cheek
then ask him...

7
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,995
Pull me out.

8
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,406
All right, take it easy.

9
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,678
It's OK.

10
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:07,680
Brain death
in the host confirmed

11
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,614
and our link is cleanly severed.

12
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:11,984
We're done.

13
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,400
Vos?

14
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:32,838
Sorry,
I don't think I'm back yet.

15
00:08:32,872 --> 00:08:35,608
- It's OK. You need a break?
- No, it's fine.

16
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,209
Let's just finish.

17
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:40,112
Go on, then.

18
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,154
Mm,
this is my grandfather's pipe.

19
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,591
And he died before I was born.

20
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,427
Um, my father gave it to me.

21
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,899
Next.

22
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:05,838
This is also mine. Uh...

23
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:08,874
I killed and mounted it
one summer when I was a girl,

24
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:12,344
and then I felt guilty about it.

25
00:09:14,246 --> 00:09:17,883
- I still feel guilty about it.
- Very good.

26
00:09:19,385 --> 00:09:20,920
Next.

27
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:30,763
This isn't mine.

28
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:34,900
- Are you sure?
- I've never seen it before.

29
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,475
Very good.

30
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:50,149
All the results are normal
across the board.

31
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:55,854
No evidence of charring,
no false psyche

32
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,457
from your time as Holly Bergman.

33
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:06,165
You look surprised.
Anything you wanna flag?

34
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:10,536
Any, um, anomalies
during interface?

35
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,439
No. No, I'm fine.

36
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:15,774
It's important not to withhold.

37
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,314
I said I was fine.

38
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:25,985
OK, good.

39
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:32,858
Our next contract's almost
finalized, and it's a big one.

40
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:36,996
I can't have my star performer
falling apart on me.

41
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,806
I would like to take
some time, though.

42
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,775
Time for what?

43
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:52,044
Well, I've been talking
to Michael

44
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:56,115
and I told him
that I'd take some time.

45
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,219
Michael.

46
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,525
Isn't he...?

47
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:12,865
You and Michael...

48
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,268
are separated.

49
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:23,942
Yeah, of course we are.

50
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:35,054
But I've been talking to him.

51
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:39,091
You're not safe for them
anymore, are you?

52
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:42,995
You told me yourself
you'd become a danger.

53
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,133
Did I say that?

54
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:16,061
Hi, darling.

55
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,666
- Hi, darl...
- Hi, darling!

56
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,134
Hi, darling!

57
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:25,037
Wha...? What have you got there?
What have you got?

58
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,473
Hi, darling.
What have you got there?

59
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:32,945
God! I'm absolutely starving.

60
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:35,447
I am absolutely starving,
Michael.

61
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:40,319
Michael, I'm absolutely...
I'm absolutely starving.

62
00:12:56,969 --> 00:12:59,037
- Mum!
- Hi, darling.

63
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:01,373
- Tas?
- Hi.

64
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:08,748
- We have food.
- Good, I'm absolutely starving.

65
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,627
Hey, get down from there.

66
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:34,874
- How was your trip?
- It was fine.

67
00:13:34,908 --> 00:13:38,678
Yeah.
Dull, extraordinarily dull.

68
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:42,114
I can't tell you how glad I am
to be back in town.

69
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,850
How is the paper?

70
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:46,952
- How's it coming?
- It's coming along.

71
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:51,089
Although Dennis tells me

72
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:55,093
the new editor's
a social science historian.

73
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,362
What's that?

74
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:00,332
Someone who's old

75
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:02,601
and stupid - they're not gonna
like what I'm writing.

76
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:06,438
- You're quite old.
- Oh. You're quite charming.

77
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,909
'New developments
in the shocking murder

78

79

84
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:25,892
What do pythons drink

85
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:27,526
I don't know,
what do they drink?

86
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,461
Gerbil tea.

87
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,035
- What have you got there?
- Dad bought it for me.

88
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:40,172
- I can make him do a dance.
- Yeah?

89
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,591
When did you get so clever?

90
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,433
I tell you
my new Greg story?

91
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:09,636
No. Please do.

92
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:11,804
I stopped by
his office and there he is

93
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:15,107
with this voluptuous,
young undergraduate student,

94
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,209
his shirt open
to the middle of his chest.

95
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:20,045
He's playing loud Indian music
and he's going on about Shakti

96
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,114
and the feminine power
principle.

97
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:26,218
Meanwhile, this girl looked
traumatized cos, well,

98
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:29,956
he's 65 years old and his chest
is more than slightly hairy.

99
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:33,292
I remember Greg's chest
hair being fairly aggressive.

100
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:36,261
It's a war crime. No, it was
literally reaching for her.

101
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:40,198
You know, I'm convinced it
detaches from his body at night

102
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,468
and it scuttles around the halls
of the girls' dormitory,

103
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:45,437
rubbing itself against
warm toilet seats

104
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,043
and slurping at the thighs of
menstruating Buddhism students.

105
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,110
Only the menstruating ones?

106
00:15:52,144 --> 00:15:54,279
Well, it's attracted
to the smell of blood.

107
00:15:54,313 --> 00:15:56,348
It's got an iron deficiency,
which in this case

108
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:58,483
can be deadly
because it leads to hair loss.

109
00:16:01,353 --> 00:16:02,722
I'm sorry.

110
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:05,692
I didn't think... I didn't think
they'd stay so long.

111
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:15,167
Why don't you ask them
to leave, then?

112
00:16:57,677 --> 00:16:59,679
Girder, hi, it's Vos.

113
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:03,315
I just wanted to apologize
for not being myself yesterday.

114
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:06,518
I think I hadn't fully shed
when we tested.

115
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:12,725
Anyway, I'm ready for work now
and... call me.

116
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,763
Yeah, please call me.
Thank you.

117
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,170
- Who was that?
- Uh... Work.

118
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:28,041
Yeah, I might have
to fly out again.

119
00:17:28,074 --> 00:17:29,842
I thought they were
giving you a break.

120
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,443
Yeah.

121
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:35,547
Uh... Something's come up.

122
00:17:36,949 --> 00:17:39,284
I want you to move back in
with us.

123
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:43,388
I hate this.

124
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,460
Tas.

125
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:52,264
Tas!

126
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:47,754
'Am I losing you?'

127
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:57,029
I'm becoming old.

128
00:18:57,063 --> 00:18:59,531
I barely recognize myself
anymore.

129
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,004
I'm too old for the machine,
I... I can't take the strain.

130
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:11,210
As time goes on, it's becoming
increasingly important

131
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:13,612
for me to find a replacement.

132
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,850
I thought that would be you.

133
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:27,794
I'm not normally
a bad judge of character.

134
00:19:27,827 --> 00:19:30,263
I would be honored.

135
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,398
You have a very special nature,

136
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:37,069
one we've worked hard together
to unlock and refine.

137
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,473
And yet,

138
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:46,646
even I can see a small thread
running from your skull

139
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,250
to a life I thought
you'd moved on from.

140
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:55,955
Sometimes, that's all it takes
to lose control,

141
00:19:55,988 --> 00:20:00,860
that small thought,
like a tiny fracture.

142
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:07,733
I wanna show you
some photographs we retained

143
00:20:07,767 --> 00:20:10,803
from your work
on the Holly Bergman job.

144
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:15,507
Why stab Elio Mazza?

145
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,577
You were provided with a pistol.

146
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,552
Well, maybe it just seemed
more in character.

147
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:32,524
Whose character?

148
00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:42,068
Do you want this?

149
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:51,476
Good.

150
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:53,846
Good.

151

And what's the narrative?

162
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:35,988
Um, well, imagine Colin Tate
as the unstable lover

163
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:38,925
who feels diminished
by his new family.

164
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,861
'Ava has all the power
in the relationship.

165
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:44,496
'It's emasculating,
he starts using more,

166
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:47,033
'behavior becoming more
and more erratic.

167
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:49,501
'Ultimately, he breaks...'

168
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:55,041
killing John,
kills Ava, kills himself.

169
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:58,644
With Ava out of the picture,
Reid inherits everything,

170
00:21:58,678 --> 00:22:02,381
becomes CEO,
cry, cry, cry for the cameras.

171
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:04,850
Clean tragedy.
No unanswered questions.

172
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:10,823
Pay is significant -
money and shares.

173
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,026
But the real target,

174
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,462
according to corporate,
is Zoothroo itself.

175
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:19,398
Hm?

176
00:22:19,432 --> 00:22:23,169
Because once we own Reid,
we own the company.

177
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:26,739
Right.

178
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:29,642
So, when do I start?

179
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,088
- You smell good.
- Stop, I need to shower.

180
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:46,058
- Have you found our treats yet?
- What do you want?

181
00:22:46,092 --> 00:22:50,763
I need a line of something to
get me started on my to-do list.

182
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:53,132
There's so much to do,
I can't figure out how to start.

183
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,566
I don't think there's any left.

184
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:57,103
I don't think
there's any left.

185
00:22:57,136 --> 00:22:58,503
That's sad news.

186
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:01,374
I don't think
there's any left.

187
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:04,043
Why don't I help with the list?

188
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:06,746
Well, it's not a list
you'd understand.

189
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:08,781
Half of it's a list
of other lists

190
00:23:08,814 --> 00:23:12,251
and the other half is
a coded list of internal chores.

191
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:13,953
'Huh.'

192
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:15,421
Huh.

193
00:23:15,454 --> 00:23:17,156
'You wanna get dinner?'

194
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:20,426
You wanna get dinner?

195
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:24,063
Do you wanna get dinner?
Do you wanna get dinner?

196
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:27,500
'I'm sorry,
I'd rather not go out.

197
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:30,535
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

198
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:35,007
'Wait till I'm back.
We'll unpack together.

199
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,809
'Do you wanna go eat?'

200
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:38,744
Do you wanna go eat?

201
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:40,746
'Let's just go walk
and find somewhere.'

202
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,649
Let's just go walk
and find somewhere.

203
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:47,585
'Mm, all right.
Let me get my jacket.'

204
00:24:45,144 --> 00:24:48,247
Any trouble?

205
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,383
'No trouble. Our driver got him
on the way to the airport.'

206
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,119
Good. How long will you need?

207
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:56,055
'It's estimating four hours
to have him prepped.'

208
00:24:57,723 --> 00:25:00,226
- And you?
- I'm ready. I feel great.

209
00:25:04,063 --> 00:25:07,666
'I'd like to offer
some reminders before we begin.

You're in a good mood
this morning.

- Have you seen my powders?
- Powders?

247

Mm. Tins of protein
and tea powders in a box?

248
00:32:34,313 --> 00:32:36,248
Gonna brew us some Damiana.

You'll like it.
It's an anti-depressant.

I haven't.

last night.

I couldn't get a flight
until late. Barely slept.

How was the trip?

254
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,535
Thrilling.

How was the rest
of your rotation?

258
00:33:08,982 --> 00:33:11,249
What's with you today?

259
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:14,386
What do you mean?

260
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:17,857
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

261
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:28,768
You've gone strange on me.

262
00:35:02,128 --> 00:35:04,731
- Good morning.
- Mr Tate.

263
00:35:04,764 --> 00:35:07,633
This week I want you on curtains
and blinds.

264
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,736
The guide is loaded
at your station.

265
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:14,339
Tate! I fucking did it!

266
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:17,009
I fucking went for it,
and it was incredible.

267
00:35:18,211 --> 00:35:19,645
You did it?

268
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,581
You know those east coast girls,
man, it was revolting.

269
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:25,584
It was inhuman. I'll never get
the sin stain out.

270
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,154
What about you, sir?

271
00:35:28,187 --> 00:35:29,789
Did you find time
in your professional sojourn

272
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:32,524
to die with your little
head-office side project?

273
00:35:34,626 --> 00:35:36,729
Well now, Eddie,
what do you think?

274
00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:38,430
Good man!

275
00:35:38,463 --> 00:35:41,033
I always considered it
your moral obligation

276
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:43,368
to cuckquean
the boss's daughter.

277
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:10,622
Uh...

278
00:37:12,424 --> 00:37:13,993
Brown curtains.

279
00:37:15,328 --> 00:37:16,863
Grommet pleat.

280

283

Mr Tate?'

286
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,412
Hello?

287
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:10,750
'You're moving at
a snail's pace. Focus.'

288
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:13,786
Sorry.

289
00:38:18,623 --> 00:38:21,493
Looks like... shears.

290
00:38:24,529 --> 00:38:26,498
No pleat visible.

291
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:32,590
'Vos, please check in.'

292
00:40:37,663 --> 00:40:40,866
- I'm here.
- 'What happened?'

293
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,170
What do you mean?

294
00:40:44,203 --> 00:40:47,206
'Your levels spiked
and I couldn't reach you.'

295
00:40:49,108 --> 00:40:54,380
Nothing. I was in the mine.
I couldn't speak freely.

296
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:56,749
'You're at the
Zoothroo building.'

297
00:40:56,782 --> 00:41:01,320
Yes.
I just started Colin's shift.

298
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:04,290
Everything seems
perfectly normal.

299
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:06,192
No disruption on this end.

300
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,695
'I don't understand.'

301
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:11,764
You should probably talk
to our new tech.

302
00:41:11,797 --> 00:41:15,234
He probably let me surge
on the controller end.

303
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:16,902
Tell him to watch his levels.

304
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:20,940
I'll have Dr Melis run
a deep analysis.

305
00:41:20,973 --> 00:41:24,276
But you report back
if you see anything -

306
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,346
minor artefacting, sync loss.

307
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:30,916
'We can't afford any mistakes
on this one.'

308
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,186
Don't worry.
I have it under control.

309
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:43,963
- Hey, Tate. You OK?
- Yeah, why?

310
00:41:43,996 --> 00:41:50,970
Well, I saw you, uh...
run out of the mine.

311
00:41:51,003 --> 00:41:54,440
- You're not looking so hot.
- I'm fine.

312
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:56,408
If you say so.

313
00:41:56,442 --> 00:41:59,111
They're having some of us come
in on Saturday to do lampshades.

314
00:41:59,145 --> 00:42:01,313
Your name's at the top
of the list.

315
00:42:01,347 --> 00:42:04,950
Why do I get the sense the boss
doesn't like you?

316
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:49,088
- Where've you been?
- I don't know.

317
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:52,491
Uh... Sorry.
I forgot my ringer was off.

318
00:43:52,524 --> 00:43:55,928
- I had to work a double.
- You have to text me.

319
00:43:56,996 --> 00:43:59,231
I almost called the police.

320
00:44:00,366 --> 00:44:02,167
I'm sorry.

321
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,909
Come and have a line with us.

322
00:44:13,912 --> 00:44:17,783
You're an absolute ghoul, Colin,
a ghoul.

323
00:44:17,816 --> 00:44:19,852
- Stop it.
- She doesn't have to stop.

324
00:44:19,885 --> 00:44:21,987
I can tell her to stop
if I want to.

325
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:24,223
Well, there are like,
correct modes of conduct.

326
00:44:24,256 --> 00:44:26,125
This isn't
the state of fucking nature.

327
00:44:26,158 --> 00:44:31,030
We're celebrating Moira's
promotion at Zoothroo.

328
00:44:31,063 --> 00:44:32,931
- You two should talk.
- Oh, at Zoothroo.

329
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:35,868
Um, nice to meet you.

330
00:44:35,901 --> 00:44:39,673
We met. I guess
it wasn't that memorable.

331
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:44,943
- When do you start?
- Yesterday.

332
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,979
Ava says you're still
on the floor.

333
00:44:47,012 --> 00:44:48,715
Why would you want that job?

334
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:51,483
Ava's dad gave it to him.

335
00:44:51,517 --> 00:44:53,118
Your father's a sadist.

336
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:57,156
I hear the floor is on par
with lower-end sweat shops.

337
00:44:57,189 --> 00:44:58,624
My father has a habit

338
00:44:58,658 --> 00:45:00,392
of subjecting my most
serious lovers

339
00:45:00,426 --> 00:45:04,530
to some insidious form
of trial by ordeal.

340
00:45:04,563 --> 00:45:08,901
In this case, I think the shape
of Colin's psychological scars

341
00:45:08,934 --> 00:45:11,270
will determine his innocence.

342
00:45:11,303 --> 00:45:13,906
Well, and I'm sorry, Ava,

343
00:45:13,939 --> 00:45:18,444
but why not just say "fuck you"
to the old man and quit?

344
00:45:23,882 --> 00:45:26,753
- Colin?
- Who is this?

345
00:45:26,786 --> 00:45:30,989
What?

346
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:33,058
I feel like a certain
type of mind must get off

347
00:45:33,092 --> 00:45:34,993
on violating people's lives
like that.

348
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:36,261
I mean, seriously,

349
00:45:36,295 --> 00:45:38,197
how much pussy
do you see at work every day?

350
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,431
Reeta!

351
00:45:39,465 --> 00:45:43,902
Well, I can only imagine
the stuff he sees over there.

352
00:45:43,936 --> 00:45:45,739
I jerk off every day
in front of my webcam

353
00:45:45,772 --> 00:45:49,541
so that Zoothroo knows which
brand of vibrator I'm using.

354
00:45:49,575 --> 00:45:52,177
We know and you can stop now.

355
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:06,325
Oh! I'm... sorry.

356
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:08,894
- What are you doing?
- Drying my hands.

357
00:46:10,129 --> 00:46:14,266
I've missed you.
Can we be friends again?

358
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:17,336
Ava doesn't care.
She doesn't mind at all.

359
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:19,706
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

360
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:21,741
Good.

361
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:25,277
So, I'll give you a call
when I get back from Chicago.

362
00:47:05,919 --> 00:47:09,154
Sorry, didn't think
they'd stay so long.

363
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:11,957
It's all right.

364
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:23,435
What's going on with you?

365
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:28,974
I'm fine.

366
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:32,344
I'm just so tired.

367
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:36,482
Is that it?

368
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:42,054
You seem so deformed
these days.

369
00:47:44,256 --> 00:47:46,225
I'm starting to worry
it's something I've done to you.

370
00:47:46,258 --> 00:47:48,093
You don't have to keep
the Zoothroo job

371
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:51,731
- if it's killing you.
- I'm fine!

372
00:47:51,764 --> 00:47:54,366
I swear on my life, I'm fine.

373
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:03,776
That's such a weird thing
to say.

374
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,444
I mean...

375
00:48:06,445 --> 00:48:07,546
Fuck!

376
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:12,217
Fuck, Colin!

377
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:15,420
You don't have to talk about it,
but it's hard sometimes.

378
00:48:15,454 --> 00:48:17,389
I don't think
I'm asking for much,

379
00:48:17,422 --> 00:48:19,458
just some basic level of access.

380
00:48:19,491 --> 00:48:21,159
Ava.

381
00:48:24,697 --> 00:48:26,398
I'm just crashing.

382
00:48:28,902 --> 00:48:30,402
I love you.

383
00:48:34,473 --> 00:48:36,275
I love you, too.

384
00:50:20,379 --> 00:50:22,314
Girder.

385
00:50:23,382 --> 00:50:25,484
Girder, please respond.

386
00:50:26,653 --> 00:50:28,153
'Vos, Status.'

387
00:50:28,186 --> 00:50:31,791
Normal. I'm right in the body.
What about Melis?

388
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:35,928
'Analysis here was inconclusive.
It's very strange.'

389
00:50:37,897 --> 00:50:39,699
Don't sound so worried.

390
00:50:39,732 --> 00:50:42,702
I'm one-to-one with the host
right now. I can feel it.

391
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:44,737
I'm completely clear.

392
00:50:47,205 --> 00:50:48,941
Besides, Parse's dinner party
is tonight.

393
00:50:48,975 --> 00:50:51,543
I'll be out
in less than 24 hours.

394
00:50:51,576 --> 00:50:55,347
'All right, good.
I want you to recalibrate.

395
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,919
'Set to: 13, 145, 12, 80, R.'

396
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:01,446
'Walter Benjamin
once wrote

397
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,050
'that boredom is a dreambird

398
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,686
'that hatches the egg

00:52:08,087 --> 00:52:11,190
'My closest friends and allies,

'I'd like to end tonight

401
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:16,629
that I am bored with you.

402
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:24,369
I am bored
because you are all so flawless.

403
00:52:25,337 --> 00:52:29,675
And our operation has become
so flawless

404
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:31,677
that I find myself
with nothing to do.

405
00:52:31,711 --> 00:52:35,614
Nothing rustles the bushes.

406
00:52:35,648 --> 00:52:40,853
And in my boredom,
an egg has hatched.

407
00:52:40,887 --> 00:52:44,389
And from it has come
the very special next stage

408
00:52:44,422 --> 00:52:47,425
in the evolution of our work.

409
00:52:48,326 --> 00:52:51,063
- To boredom!
- To boredom!

410
00:53:07,013 --> 00:53:08,346
Ready for this?

411
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,482
Yeah, of course I am,
why wouldn't I be?

412
00:53:10,515 --> 00:53:13,820
Well, I love my father,
but he's an atrocity.

413
00:53:13,853 --> 00:53:17,156
- He's a great man.
- He's really not.

414
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,324
I'm not even sure he's human.

415
00:53:19,357 --> 00:53:22,228
He's just like this giant,
human-shaped protozoan

416
00:53:22,261 --> 00:53:24,030
that feeds off misery.

417
00:53:24,831 --> 00:53:26,666
Come on.

418
00:53:38,277 --> 00:53:40,579
Daddy?

419
00:53:40,612 --> 00:53:43,415
Darling, you've brought a boy
home with you.

420
00:53:43,448 --> 00:53:47,854
- Good evening, Mr Parse.
- Yes.

421
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:50,323
We were just discussing
the psychology

422
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:52,490
of failing as a parent.

423
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:53,960
You start to embrace it,
I think,

424
00:53:53,993 --> 00:53:57,129
when you realize
there's nothing else you can do.

425
00:53:57,163 --> 00:54:00,132
Mr Boyko also has daughters.

426
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:01,801
- Alex
- Colin.

427
00:54:01,834 --> 00:54:04,569
- Colin works for me now.
- Oh?

428
00:54:04,603 --> 00:54:06,939
Yes, I, uh... I found him a job

429
00:54:06,973 --> 00:54:10,575
that, hopefully,
isn't beyond his skillset.

430
00:54:10,609 --> 00:54:13,578
Managing to keep
your head above water, Colin?

431
00:54:13,612 --> 00:54:16,782
- I'm fine. Thanks.
- Good, good.

432
00:54:16,816 --> 00:54:20,418
You let me know if it gets
too difficult for you.

433
00:54:32,464 --> 00:54:35,134
- You need a drink.
- Yeah.

434
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:38,271
Wait here.
I'll be back with gin.

435
00:54:38,304 --> 00:54:39,639
OK.

436
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:31,257
I'm in place.

437
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,659
'Good.'

438
00:55:33,693 --> 00:55:36,896
Tonight, I want you to get in
a fight with Parse.

439
00:55:36,929 --> 00:55:40,900
Get yourself thrown out,
something public,

440
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:44,136
and later you can go back
and we'll finish this.

441
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:46,005
Understood.

442
00:56:12,264 --> 00:56:13,466
What the...?

443
00:56:13,498 --> 00:56:16,102
- You OK?
- I'm sorry.

444
00:56:16,135 --> 00:56:20,439
Yeah, sorry. You
want... You want another drink?

445
00:56:20,473 --> 00:56:22,607
No, I'm fine.

446
00:57:09,455 --> 00:57:11,524
Can we help you?

447
00:57:11,556 --> 00:57:13,659
I've a feeling you owe me
an apology?

448
00:57:13,692 --> 00:57:16,328
Oh, is that right?

449
00:57:17,296 --> 00:57:19,065
I have a feeling.

450
00:57:22,034 --> 00:57:25,337
My... My future son-in-law,
everyone.

451
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:29,942
We're just having
a little chat here, Colin,

452
00:57:29,975 --> 00:57:33,611
so why don't you fuck off
into a corner somewhere?

453
00:57:33,646 --> 00:57:36,048
Don't dirty my floor.

454
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:40,886
I'll leave when Ava's done with
my fucking cock in her mouth.

455
00:57:45,858 --> 00:57:47,625
Ah, hey!

456
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:51,130
Hey, that's enough.

457
00:57:51,163 --> 00:57:55,167
Fuck off! Get the fuck off!

458
00:57:55,201 --> 00:57:59,271
You think you can step on me?
I'm a giant!

459
00:57:59,305 --> 00:58:01,874
- I'm a fucking giant!
- Colin!

460
00:58:01,907 --> 00:58:04,276
- Fuck off, you bitch!
- Get him out!

461
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:06,078
You fucking bitch!

462
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,355
Shit!

463
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:01,093
I don't think
I can go home tonight.

464
01:00:01,126 --> 01:00:02,795
You stay here.

465
01:00:03,729 --> 01:00:05,798
Your room's been waiting.

466
01:00:08,367 --> 01:00:11,103
You haven't been helping.

467
01:00:11,136 --> 01:00:14,440
You're such a creature.
You're unbearable.

468
01:00:19,078 --> 01:00:23,315
- I'm going to bed.
- Yeah.

469
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:27,152
Why don't you run off to fucking
Dubai with your mother, then?

470
01:00:27,186 --> 01:00:28,854
Dubai and goodbye.

471
01:00:55,981 --> 01:00:58,083
What are you doing here?

472
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:07,092
What is this?

473
01:01:07,526 --> 01:01:08,961
Get out!

474
01:01:08,994 --> 01:01:11,530
Get out before I call
the police.

475
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:16,101
Why don't you make me?

476
01:01:21,273 --> 01:01:23,075
I'm drunk.

477
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:29,148
I'm going to bed.

478
01:02:13,693 --> 01:02:16,428
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

479
01:04:35,601 --> 01:04:37,169
Pull me out.

480
01:04:48,614 --> 01:04:50,182
Fuck!

481
01:04:51,617 --> 01:04:53,085
Fuck!

482
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:13,605
Out! Get me out!

483
01:05:17,911 --> 01:05:20,145
Get me out! Get me out!

484
01:06:09,963 --> 01:06:12,031
- What happened?
- She's surging.

485
01:06:12,065 --> 01:06:14,366
Don't pull her, don't...

486
01:06:24,777 --> 01:06:26,779
I'm reading physical damage
to the implants.

487
01:06:26,813 --> 01:06:29,649
- Signal is heavily corrupted.
- I need dampers on her now.

488
01:06:40,927 --> 01:06:43,595
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

489
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:51,731
Your agent is stable,
but non-responsive.

490
01:07:51,764 --> 01:07:56,002
Seems she was unable to maintain
control over the host will.

491
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:58,503
- And Tate?
- Hard to say.

492
01:07:58,537 --> 01:08:01,107
We're now tracking him
as the dominant in the body,

493
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,076
but I'm seeing a great deal
of bleed-through.

494
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:05,912
Let's leave her in, see
if she can fight her way back

495
01:08:05,945 --> 01:08:07,245
and finish the job.

496
01:08:07,279 --> 01:08:10,683
There's already a degree
of permanent damage.

497
01:08:10,717 --> 01:08:14,219
The longer she stays in, the
greater the risk to her brain.

498
01:08:14,252 --> 01:08:15,922
She stays in.

499
01:08:35,507 --> 01:08:36,876
Help me.

500
01:09:16,849 --> 01:09:21,319
'Mr Tate?
Mr Tate, are you there?

501
01:09:21,353 --> 01:09:23,823
'I was wondering
if I might have a word.'

502
01:09:29,327 --> 01:09:32,865
They're following.

503
01:09:39,806 --> 01:09:41,674
They're... following.

504
01:09:43,943 --> 01:09:45,912
They're following me.

505
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:52,051
Ugh! God!

506
01:09:56,823 --> 01:09:59,091
Hello?

507
01:10:03,162 --> 01:10:04,664
Hey, what...?
What are you doing here?

508
01:10:04,697 --> 01:10:06,498
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, look.

509
01:10:06,531 --> 01:10:08,533
Look, I did it. Uh...

510
01:10:08,567 --> 01:10:11,938
I did it, you know, so that
we can be together. I did it.

511
01:10:11,971 --> 01:10:14,640
- What? What have you done?
- I did it. I did it.

512
01:10:16,275 --> 01:10:18,610
I was just...
I was just... I was angry.

513
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:24,250
They... They...
They attacked me.

514
01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:26,384
All I was doing
was defending myself.

515
01:10:26,418 --> 01:10:28,821
Colin, you're not making
any sense.

516
01:10:28,855 --> 01:10:31,090
I should have stayed
with Michael.

517
01:10:31,123 --> 01:10:32,825
Who's Michael?

518
01:10:33,926 --> 01:10:35,627
I don't know.

519
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:38,998
Oh, my God.
Fuck! You're bleeding.

520
01:10:40,066 --> 01:10:43,069
OK, come on, sit down. Sit down.

521
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:52,745
Oh, yeah, I tripped on the way
over here and I...

522
01:10:52,778 --> 01:10:54,379
I hit my head.

523
01:10:54,412 --> 01:10:57,216
OK, well, you're going to have
to go to the hospital

524
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:00,485
because you probably
have a concussion.

525
01:11:00,518 --> 01:11:02,788
No, I'll be all right.

526
01:11:05,258 --> 01:11:07,260
Sorry if I scared you.

527
01:11:07,293 --> 01:11:09,561
Scare me?

528
01:11:10,696 --> 01:11:12,331
Here.

529
01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:16,468
You want some water, or gin?

530
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:19,038
It's water or gin,
that's all I got.

531
01:11:19,071 --> 01:11:21,573
I'm just getting ready
to go to the airport.

532
01:11:23,441 --> 01:11:26,611
- Chicago.
- Mm-hm.

533
01:11:26,646 --> 01:11:29,181
When I get back,
we should see each other.

534
01:11:30,415 --> 01:11:32,084
Ava and I had a fight.

535
01:11:33,352 --> 01:11:35,054
Can I stay here?

536
01:11:36,055 --> 01:11:37,723
I can't go home.

537
01:11:39,491 --> 01:11:41,459
Poor baby.

538
01:11:56,342 --> 01:11:59,444
OK, two nights.

539
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:02,447
Leave the key at the desk
when you go.

540
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,117
OK?
Right, I'm gonna take a shower.

541
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:06,852
Thank you.

542
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:25,137
Darling.

543
01:12:28,874 --> 01:12:30,575
Darling.

544
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:35,848
Of course, darling.

545
01:12:40,152 --> 01:12:41,721
Starving.

546
01:12:44,957 --> 01:12:46,826
Absolutely starving.

547
01:12:49,895 --> 01:12:51,596
Absolute...

548
01:13:49,955 --> 01:13:51,023
Colin?

549
01:14:19,985 --> 01:14:21,320
'We're hearing
from the family

550
01:14:21,353 --> 01:14:24,223
'that the condition of
Jonathan Parse has stabilized,

551

Who is it?

560
01:14:50,549 --> 01:14:52,318
'Tate! Tate!'

561
01:14:53,752 --> 01:14:57,089
- Eddie?
- 'Come on, let me in already.'

562
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:06,966
Here, come on, here.
Let me have a look at you.

563
01:15:06,999 --> 01:15:10,269
- Oh, poor thing. You poor dear.
- What are you doing here?

564
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:13,706
I heard you were in an accident.
I wanted to check up on you.

565
01:15:13,739 --> 01:15:16,942
- How did you know I was here?
- Reeta called me over.

566
01:15:16,976 --> 01:15:20,813
- You know Reeta?
- Sure do. Hey, get me a drink.

567
01:15:20,846 --> 01:15:23,082
Oh, yeah.

568
01:16:39,258 --> 01:16:41,860
Vos. Vos.

569
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:45,864
There you go.
You're coming back.

570
01:16:45,898 --> 01:16:47,800
I've temporarily suppressed
the host's will.

571
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,368
You should have near
to full control

572
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:53,472
but we need to move quickly
before the effects wear off, OK?

573
01:16:58,177 --> 01:16:59,411
Oh, whoa, whoa.

574
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:02,682
Let's be civil.

575
01:17:02,716 --> 01:17:06,018
Girder sent me.
I'm your lifeline.

576
01:17:10,022 --> 01:17:12,858
- Girder?
- I was a plant.

577
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:14,827
You didn't know?
I'm a collaborator.

578
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:17,563
I scouted Tate
for the Parse deal.

579
01:17:17,596 --> 01:17:19,331
Come on, come on.

580
01:17:28,642 --> 01:17:31,043
There we go.

581
01:17:31,076 --> 01:17:35,381
I've heard a lot about you,
the great Tasya Vos.

582
01:17:35,414 --> 01:17:39,753
It's real honor. I was a huge
fan of the Elio Mazza stabbing.

583
01:17:39,818 --> 01:17:41,920
Eddie?

584
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:48,861
In the head.

585
01:17:48,894 --> 01:17:50,664
I can't seem
to pull the trigger.

586
01:17:50,697 --> 01:17:52,865
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm a Christian.

587
01:17:52,898 --> 01:17:54,833
Besides, Girder says
it has to be you.

588
01:17:54,867 --> 01:17:56,802
Distraught killer
can't live with the guilt.

589
01:17:56,835 --> 01:17:59,271
Something public.
No questions. Look, I'm...

590
01:18:00,506 --> 01:18:02,508
I'm just here to fix your head.

591
01:18:04,243 --> 01:18:06,912
It's just that I don't have
complete control right now.

592
01:18:06,945 --> 01:18:08,981
That's why I'm here.

593
01:18:09,014 --> 01:18:12,217
Come on.
We don't have much time.

594
01:18:16,922 --> 01:18:18,824
All right. There you go.

595
01:18:24,229 --> 01:18:25,799
Yeah.

596
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:27,366
OK.

597
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:30,770
There you go. Just booting up.

598
01:18:30,804 --> 01:18:32,672
I'm gonna check your sync first.

599
01:18:32,706 --> 01:18:35,709
You'll see a series of images.

600
01:18:35,742 --> 01:18:38,944
Just look at them
and answer my questions.

601
01:18:39,945 --> 01:18:42,414
Do you see a fox or a bird?

602
01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:45,150
Fox.

603
01:18:45,184 --> 01:18:48,287
- Fish or snake?
- Fish.

604
01:18:49,922 --> 01:18:53,660
- Mouse or a dog?
- Mouse.

605
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:59,064
Good, good. You're seeing all
the right animals, as they say.

606
01:18:59,098 --> 01:19:03,737
Now, I'm going to do
a pulse analysis.

607
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:05,003
You might find this
uncomfortable,

608
01:19:05,037 --> 01:19:08,207
but you just need to try
to keep breathing.

609
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,541
Ready?

610
01:21:52,604 --> 01:21:54,206
Oh, God!

611
01:21:55,675 --> 01:21:57,209
Eddie.

612
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,045
Eddie.

613
01:22:01,446 --> 01:22:03,348
Eddie. Oh!

614
01:22:03,883 --> 01:22:05,250
Oh, fuck.

615
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:07,654
Oh, fuck.

616
01:22:08,821 --> 01:22:10,857
No, no, no. Fuck!

617
01:22:12,926 --> 01:22:14,459
Oh, fuck!

618
01:22:14,493 --> 01:22:17,429
Oh, fuck!

619
01:22:32,377 --> 01:22:33,846
Oh, shit.

620
01:23:07,145 --> 01:23:09,314
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

621
01:23:12,752 --> 01:23:14,319
You bitch.

622
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,428
You want a shot? Do it.

623
01:23:24,296 --> 01:23:27,700
Do it! Do it! Do it!

624
01:23:27,734 --> 01:23:30,637
Do it! Do it! Do it!

625
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,170
Do it!

626
01:23:57,596 --> 01:23:59,464
You missed.

627
01:24:16,816 --> 01:24:18,651
Hi, darling.

628
01:24:21,688 --> 01:24:23,522
Darling.

629
01:24:25,457 --> 01:24:27,192
Darling.

630
01:24:35,768 --> 01:24:37,569
Hi, darling.

631
01:24:41,007 --> 01:24:42,675
Darling.

632
01:24:45,745 --> 01:24:47,412
Hi, darling.

633
01:24:52,919 --> 01:24:54,453
Michael.

634
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:23,683
Hello, Michael.

635
01:25:26,018 --> 01:25:28,386
I'm absolutely starving.

636
01:25:32,825 --> 01:25:34,626
I'm starving.

637
01:26:09,996 --> 01:26:11,798
- Hello.
- Hi.

638
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:16,068
- What you got there?
- A map.

639
01:26:17,435 --> 01:26:19,437
What's it a map of?

640
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:23,475
It goes to the pond.
I discovered it yesterday.

641
01:26:23,508 --> 01:26:24,543
Oh.

642
01:26:26,344 --> 01:26:30,116
- What's your name?
- I'm Ira.

643
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:31,516
Ira.

644
01:26:34,187 --> 01:26:36,022
I think I know you
from somewhere.

645
01:26:40,525 --> 01:26:42,829
Is that your house over there?

646
01:26:45,131 --> 01:26:47,365
- Ira!
- Uh-oh.

647
01:26:54,106 --> 01:26:55,540
Yeah.

648
01:27:39,118 --> 01:27:40,887
Michael?

649
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:42,855
Yes.

650
01:27:43,956 --> 01:27:47,293
Uh, hi, I'm a friend
of your wife's.

651
01:27:47,326 --> 01:27:49,394
I'm a friend of Tas.

652
01:27:52,331 --> 01:27:54,634
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.

653
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:56,135
Tasya doesn't live here anymore.

654
01:27:56,168 --> 01:27:59,471
No, I know. I know, she wanted
me to tell you something.

655
01:27:59,504 --> 01:28:02,275
- Yeah, maybe some other time.
- Can I come in to talk?

656
01:28:02,308 --> 01:28:04,243
Get in the fucking house!

657
01:28:04,277 --> 01:28:06,012
- Please.
- Where is she?

658
01:28:06,045 --> 01:28:08,114
- She doesn't live here anymore.
- Where is she?

659
01:28:08,147 --> 01:28:10,683
- I swear I don't know.
- Sit down! Hands on the table!

660
01:28:10,716 --> 01:28:12,285
Get your hands on the table.

661
01:28:12,318 --> 01:28:14,720
She travels for work. I don't
think she's in the country.

662
01:28:14,754 --> 01:28:17,422
Do you recognize me?
Do you know me?

663
01:28:18,391 --> 01:28:19,992
I need to know.

664
01:28:20,026 --> 01:28:23,796
I need to know what she's done
to me, do you understand?

665
01:28:23,829 --> 01:28:26,498
Tell me what this is about.
Maybe I can help.

666
01:28:30,002 --> 01:28:32,271
Do you ever think of your wife
as a predator?

667
01:28:32,305 --> 01:28:34,206
Hm, do you ever think of her
that way?

668
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,808
I don't know.
I don't understand.

669
01:28:35,841 --> 01:28:38,077
Don't look at me.
Get your head down.

670
01:28:39,477 --> 01:28:42,915
Do you ever worry about
parasites, like the cat?

671
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:45,985
What?

672
01:28:46,018 --> 01:28:51,390
Just think, one day your wife
is cleaning the cat litter

673
01:28:51,424 --> 01:28:53,693
and she gets a worm in her,

674
01:28:53,726 --> 01:28:57,663
and that worm ends up
in her brain.

675
01:28:57,697 --> 01:29:01,499
The next thing that happens is
she gets an idea in there, too.

676
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:07,539
And it's hard to say
whether that idea is really hers

677
01:29:07,572 --> 01:29:09,408
or it's just the worm.

678
01:29:09,442 --> 01:29:11,777
And it makes her do
certain things.

679
01:29:12,878 --> 01:29:14,714
Predator things.

680
01:29:14,747 --> 01:29:18,351
Eventually, you realize that she
isn't the same person anymore.

681
01:29:18,384 --> 01:29:21,220
She's not the person
that she used to be.

682
01:29:22,388 --> 01:29:24,890
It's gotta make you wonder...

683
01:29:26,558 --> 01:29:29,128
whether you're really
married to her...

684
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:32,497
or married to the worm.

685
01:29:36,769 --> 01:29:39,839
Are you seeing this,
you fucking bitch? I'll do it.

686
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:44,276
Come out or I'll do it!

687
01:29:53,686 --> 01:29:55,654
I'm here. I'm here.

688
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:00,926
What are you doing here?

689
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:03,863
Tas.

690
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:07,867
I've been looking for you.
I wanted to talk.

691
01:30:09,769 --> 01:30:11,237
Why?

692
01:30:12,405 --> 01:30:14,807
What have you done to me?

693
01:30:15,441 --> 01:30:17,143
Done to you?

694
01:30:19,577 --> 01:30:21,847
You're the one in control.

695
01:30:22,915 --> 01:30:24,216
No.

696
01:30:25,718 --> 01:30:28,721
I haven't been in control
of myself lately.

697
01:30:29,922 --> 01:30:31,157
But you have.

698
01:30:32,624 --> 01:30:34,093
Where's Ava?

699
01:30:39,532 --> 01:30:41,667
Where's your lovely girl?

700
01:30:43,568 --> 01:30:45,271
Can't you remember?

701
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,909
No, that wasn't me.

702
01:30:51,444 --> 01:30:53,746
Of course it was.

703
01:30:58,517 --> 01:31:00,252
Poor Michael.

704
01:31:02,688 --> 01:31:04,857
I loved him, too.

705
01:31:10,296 --> 01:31:12,631
But I'm not sure if it was me.

706
01:31:17,636 --> 01:31:19,238
I'll kill him.

707
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:24,310
You fix this
or I swear I'll kill him.

708
01:31:26,712 --> 01:31:29,548
Go ahead. Do it.

709
01:31:29,582 --> 01:31:32,151
He's only holding you back.

710
01:31:38,757 --> 01:31:41,160
This is what
you've always wanted.

711
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:00,039
Pull me out.

712
01:34:33,499 --> 01:34:35,301
Pull me out.

713
01:36:04,156 --> 01:36:06,693
'Do you need
to take a break?

714
01:36:06,726 --> 01:36:09,461
'No, let's finish.'

715
01:36:09,495 --> 01:36:11,029
OK.

716
01:36:13,098 --> 01:36:15,401
This is my grandfather's pipe.

717
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:18,537
He died before I was born.

718
01:36:20,005 --> 01:36:22,074
My father gave it to me.

719
01:36:22,809 --> 01:36:24,476
Good.

720
01:36:25,444 --> 01:36:27,079
Next?

721
01:36:36,388 --> 01:36:39,091
This is also mine.

722
01:36:39,124 --> 01:36:43,328
I killed and mounted it one
summer when I was a little girl.

723
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:49,968
Very good.

724
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:28,046

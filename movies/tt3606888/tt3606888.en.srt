2
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,395
Cheers, mate.

3
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,960
Yo.

4
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,800
Hey, Elvis. You've seen D?

5
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,229
I'm not looking for D.

6
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,520
You on the dollies again?

7
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,478
Do you see a welcome sign over my head?

8
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,710
Go away, Baz.

9
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,395
Brass monkeys, man.

10
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,672
Where are you crashing tonight?

11
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,311
No, seriously. You've seen D?

12
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,591
Seriously, I'm on the script.

13
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,553
I mean it this time.

14
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,110
Yeah, who doesn't?

15
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,711
Well, tell D I'm looking for him, yeah?

16
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,396
Three quid, mate.

17
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,596
Eighty and two...

18
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,434
...four, six, eight, ten...

19
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,713
You're short.

20
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,469
It's all I've got.

21
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,915
It's three quid, mate.

22
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,719
Come on, I've barely eaten all day.

23
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,031
It's three quid.

24
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,676
- Can you let me off 9p?
- No!

25
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,998
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll play you a little song, yeah?

26
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,680
How about that? Play you a little song...

27
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,991
...and you let me off 9p, okay? All right.

28
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,796
- Thanks, mate. That's great.
- Don't come back.

29
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,559
- Okay.
- Don't want you here. Go on!

30
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,677
All right! Okay, I'm going.

31
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,193
Thanks a lot.

32
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,554
Get out of here!

33
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,790
Sorry, sorry.

34
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,914
Yo, Elvis. Get in.

35
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,354
- Whose is it?
- The bloke who forgot to lock it.

36
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,114
I found D.

37
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,078
Have some.

38
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,958
Hey! I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
No, no, no.

39
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,634
That's nice, that's nice.

40
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,156
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do. You're late.

41
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,039
- Who are these?
- I don't know. It's your car!

42
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,793
How long have they been here? Hey!

43
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,395
What are you doing in my car?
You didn't knock on the door?

44
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,755
- Why should I?
- James.

45
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,910
James!

46
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,878
James! James, come on, wake up.

47
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,635
- You can't do this! Not now!
- Did you see them get in?

48
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,792
- Do I look like a genie?
- From a certain angle.

49
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,992
Hey! What? Come back here!

50
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,509
- Get after him, will you? Hey.
- This isn't <i>Batman and Robin,</i> you know.

51
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,034
- Hey.
- Pay for the ticket and move.

52
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,557
Wake up. You're in my car. Hey.

53
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,393
Wait, he's...

54
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,952
He's not moving.

55
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,155
Did they bring my guitar?

56
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,955
Nice to see you, too.

57
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,396
Sorry, I'm not exactly myself
this morning.

58
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,360
That's a matter of opinion.

59
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,991
- They brought it to me.
- To you?

60
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,953
Well, it isn't our first time
at this circus, is it?

61
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,355
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,193
I know I made a mistake. I messed up.

63
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,159
Tell me something I haven't
already heard 20 times today.

64
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,470
Good.

65
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,711
I prefer the sound of silence to bullshit.

66
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,990
How do you feel?

67
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,833
Like death.

68
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,280
Look at me, I'm...

69
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,110
It's horrible.

70
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,272
Turns out you've also got hepatitis.

71
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,796
Congratulations.

72
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,360
Ever wonder why you see so many
old alkies, never junkies?

73
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,279
You're all full of good news
this morning, aren't you?

74
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,631
You can't mix heroin with methadone.

75
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,712
You OD. You know this stuff.

76
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,032
- Yeah.
- Do it again, and you'll probably die.

77
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,632
I know. Look, I...

78
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,514
- I'm sorry...
- Silence over bullshit.

79
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,390
Right.

80
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,279
- I'll see you when you're discharged.
- Yeah.

81
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,118
- Hi.
- Did you nick an orderly's uniform?

82
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,039
No, I didn't nick it.

83
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,556
A nurse gave it to me
because they lost my T-shirt.

84
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,514
Right.

85
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,353
You know the drill. Sign that one...

86
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,957
...and take that one to the chemist
every day for your methadone.

87
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,470
Check in with me every two weeks.

88
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,474
And addicts who stop the methadone
and go back to heroin...

89
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,156
- ...have a higher percentage of ODing.
- Of ODing. Yeah, I know this already.

90
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,880
It's my job to tell you.
Fall off methadone...

91
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,997
...and it's more likely you'll OD
the next time you do heroin.

92
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,117
And you could well die.

93
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,680
Yeah.

94
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,240
Is there anyone I can call?

95
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,914
Any relative anywhere?

96
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,356
I'm kind of solo these days.

97
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,319
No word from your dad?

98
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,000
Or mum?

99
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,630
Yeah.

100
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,029
"Get lost."

101
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,635
- I guess that's two words.
- Here you go.

102
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,120
Thank you.

103
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,032
You're gonna play something for me?

104
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,469
You wanna hear me sing?

105
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,960
Are you any good?

106
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,230
Okay.

107
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,630
Here you are, mate.

108
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,511
Hey, get moving.

109
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,040
Come on, on your way.

110
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,392
I wouldn't be begging you
if it wasn't a special case.

111
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,040
Special?

112
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,560
I've got three single mums
waiting for a spot.

113
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,671
I've got a sweet old pensioner
getting kicked out of his son's house.

114
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,470
They all need emergency housing.
They're all special.

115
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,114
Please.

116
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,670
What's so special about a drug addict?
Why this one?

117
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,320
I don't know.

118
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,031
Every now and then, one comes along...

119
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,720
...and you just know
they have it in them to be clean.

120
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,394
I think this is his last shot.

121
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,150
He really wants to be clean,
but he's got nothing.

122
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,913
No support system at all.

123
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,680
I have to get him off the street,
or I'm gonna lose him.

124
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,834
No. I'm not giving a spot to a user.

125
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,600
- He's in the program.
- He falls off methadone, he's out.

126
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,877
- Period.
- He won't.

127
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,960
I hope.

128
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,074
Come on, everybody.

129
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,630
Come on, then. Albert, this side.

130
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,596
- Val?
- Hey. Come in.

131
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,272
Welcome home.

132
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,192
- You okay?
- Yeah.

133
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
It was a little bit stuffy,
so I just opened a window.

134
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,996
Hot water.

135
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,435
Look, I've gotta run.

136
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,272
- Keys.
- Right, yeah.

137
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,470
Val, I...

138
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,915
You're welcome.

139
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,954
And I put some cereal in the kitchen
and milk in the fridge.

140
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,440
I don't know what to say.

141
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,560
Say you're gonna stay in the program
and you won't miss our next meeting.

142
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,513
I promise. I promise you.

143
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,759
Cross my heart, hope to die.

144
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,789
Okay.

145
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,840
I'll see you out.

146
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,550
Whoever's there, you better leave!

147
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,873
I mean it!

148
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,237
I've got a weapon here!

149
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,632
I'm seriously armed!

150
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,759
That was you making all that noise?

151
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,673
How did you get...

152
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,830
I see.

153
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,797
You're a thief, are you?

154
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,957
Stealing all my corn flakes?

155
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,792
Hey, are you friendly?

156
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,511
Guess that answers that.

157
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,195
No. Come on. This way.

158
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,874
There you go.

159
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,877
They're better with
a bit of milk, actually.

160
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,997
I'm gonna get this out.

161
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,911
You're not a very good thief, by the way.

162
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,470
Next time, try and be a bit quieter.

163
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,597
That's the trick, I hear. Come on.

164
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,192
Up you come. Look.

165
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,394
Look at that.

166
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,360
There's gonna be a family
worried about you.

167
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,152
You'd better go home now.

168
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,276
No, no, no.

169
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,516
This way.

170
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,036
I know. But I think it's time,
you'd better go home.

171
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,237
Hey, no, this way. There you go.

172
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,519
Go on. Go out there.

173
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,316
That's it. Go on.

174
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,071
No, don't look at me like that, okay?

175
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,920
All right, then.

176
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,995
One night, okay?

177
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,591
And then I'm gonna
take you back to your owner.

178
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,640
Yeah, deal?

179
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,399
There you go.

180
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,791
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

181
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,440
Over there?

182
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,359
Excuse me.

183
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,152
Did you lose a cat?

184
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,554
Is it there?

185
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,836
No?

186
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,515
Excuse me?

187
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,952
Did you lose a cat?

188
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,110
Hello?

189
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,358
I've got a little ginger cat down here,
if anyone's looking for it.

190
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,199
Hello?

191
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,432
So, what number life are you on?

192
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,035
Apparently, I'm on my ninth.

193
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,631
Hello, did anybody lose a cat?

194
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,440
- Get out of here! Go away!
- Thanks.

195
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,035
Come on.

196
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,873
There you go.

197
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,677
Someone will come looking for you.

198
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,030
Take care of yourself.

199
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,110
Thank you.

200
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,352
- Hi.
- Methadone, right?

201
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,910
Thank you, mate.

202
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,432
Not you again. Oi!

203
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,030
- Come on, on your way.
- Don't do this, mate.

204
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,237
You know the rules.
You're causing an obstruction.

205
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,359
I'm just trying to make a living here.
I'm not in anyone's way.

206
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,040
It's an health and safety issue.

207
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,396
If you stand there,
you're obstructing the exit.

208
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,313
Well, if you stand there, you are.

209
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,711
- One toot on this, they'll haul you away.
- Right.

210
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,998
- If it was up to me, I'd arrest the lot of you.
- I'm sure you would.

211
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,193
Flippin' vermin.
As if we haven't got enough to do.

212
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,916
Dad? Dad.

213
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,200
Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?

214
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,680
We're...

215
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,992
A little bit of shopping. This and that.

216
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,634
- Oh, yeah.
- You good?

217
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,752
Yeah. I've stopped using.

218
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,515
- I'm in the program.
- Again?

219
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,076
It won't be like last time.

220
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,039
- I've got my own flat now, and everything.
- Jack.

221
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,957
- You remember Hilary.
- Hi.

222
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,795
We're late, darling.
I'm sorry, we've got to...

223
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,429
We were just chatting
about Christmas, actually.

224
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,638
Family and all that. Coming together.

225
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,757
Christmas dinner. Right, Dad?

226
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,152
Well, I wish we'd known.
Unfortunately, our table's full.

227
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,471
Always room
for one more at Christmas. Right?

228
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,950
Don't you think, darling?
Maybe one more would...

229
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,316
What, in our house?
We'll have children there.

230
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,074
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jack, we're late. Come on.

231
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,993
I'm not contagious, you know.

232
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,070
Take this.

233
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,674
- No, I don't want your money.
- Here.

234
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,474
Maybe...

235
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,433
Maybe New Year's, okay?

236
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,712
Darling. Hold up.

237
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,473
Hey, wait up.

238
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,630
Yeah.

239
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,870
Hey, mate.

240
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,279
Hey, boy.

241
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,239
It's okay.

242
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,159
You're hurt.

243
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,152
What have you been doing today?

244
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,352
Have you been in a fight?

245
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,638
Is it okay if I take you
and try and find your owner?

246
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,195
Is that okay?

247
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,194
It's okay.

248
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,235
Here, down here?

249
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,794
Excuse me. Do you know whose cat this is?

250
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,550
Wait, I have a hurt cat here.

251
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,479
It's you, with the dogs.

252
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,279
Yeah, it's just in there.

253
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,556
What did you do to it?

254
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,280
Me? I didn't do anything.
I just found him over there.

255
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,112
Don't just stand there.

256
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,993
It's all right.

257
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,232
- It's okay, it's okay.
- There you go.

258
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,519
There we go.

259
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,999
Yeah, it might be purulent.

260
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,915
- It might be what?
- The wound.

261
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,112
He needs antibiotics before it's infected.

262
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,599
Maybe they can glue it together.
He needs a vet.

263
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,515
That sounds expensive.

264
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,154
Can you put a price on love?

265
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,549
No, no. He's not my cat.

266
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,155
I just found him.
I think he's a stray or...

267
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,880
- I don't know.
- Well...

268
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,557
He is telling me
he was put here to be with you.

269
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,831
Reading his spirit loud and clear.

270
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,995
He came to you for a reason.

271
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,959
Really? You're sensing that?

272
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,919
Of course not. What do I look like,
some kind of nut?

273
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,913
There's a card there
for the vet that I volunteer at.

274
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,400
It's a charity.

275
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,120
- Tell them Betty sent you.
- Okay, thanks.

276
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,835
And you are?

277
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,071
Me? I'm James.

278
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,469
James Bowen.

279
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,075
I don't believe in last names.
Patriarchal burdens.

280
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,277
I gotta go. I've got dogs to walk.

281
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,669
Right, yeah.

282
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,279
Okay, mate. It's all right.

283
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,070
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Allergic. Animals.

284
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,232
- Ironic, huh?
- Yeah.

285
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,630
You should go.

286
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,032
Bacteria's multiplying by the second...

287
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,873
...and Bob needs a vet.

288
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,156
Bob?

289
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,516
That's what he told me
he wants you to call him.

290
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,479
It's okay.
He's not actually my cat, you know.

291
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,518
Mine, yours. We all belong to each other.

292
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,000
See you, Bob!

293
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,636
It was nice to meet you.

294
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,433
You're a bit of an attention hog.

295
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,559
Do you know that, Bob?

296
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,119
It's okay. I got you.

297
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,194
Hi there.

298
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,000
I just found this cat,
and he's hurt himself.

299
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,674
A stray?

300
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,990
I don't know.

301
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,039
- Are you asking us to put him down?
- What? No.

302
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,039
You know how many stray cats
are in London? It's an epidemic.

303
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,993
Well, he's got a name. It's Bob.

304
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,034
And the wound, it's purulent.

305
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,870
Take a number.

306
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,796
It's gonna be a long wait.

307
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,116
I've gotta be somewhere.

308
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,237
Can't I drop him off and come back?

309
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,198
Does this look like a dry-cleaner's?

310
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,959
Okay, okay.

311
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,035
It's okay, it's okay.

312
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,514
It's okay.

313
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,436
Look. It's a rabbit.

314
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,793
No, no, no.

315
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,920
Don't look at the rabbit.
The rabbit's not for dinner, okay?

316
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,310
Don't worry about him, Bob. It's okay.

317
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,838
Bob, look, it's the month of the cat.

318
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,275
Yeah.

319
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,952
That's the kind of hat for you, isn't it?

320
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,072
Look at Tiffany. She looks cute.

321
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,796
Who's that? Look at that one.

322
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,474
Lucky. Look at Lucky.

323
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,912
Doesn't look so lucky, does he?

324
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,039
I've missed my appointment.
Val's gonna kill me.

325
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,795
I can't miss rush-hour busking.
I've gotta go, all right?

326
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,231
I'll have to come back tomorrow.

327
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,232
Number 62 is up.

328
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,112
It's okay. It's okay.

329
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,115
Hi.

330
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,752
- He did great.
- You okay?

331
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,629
Yeah? Come on, then, mister. In you get.

332
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,792
- That's it. Good boy.
- Okay.

333
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,399
- You get your pills from the front desk.
- Okay.

334
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,634
22 pounds.

335
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,558
I thought she said this place was free.

336
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,959
Not the drugs.

337
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,039
Sorry, mate.

338
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,790
Hang on.

339
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,594
That's all I've got.
Come on, he's really sick.

340
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,194
All right, wait.

341
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,598
- This is my food money for the next week.
- It's up to you.

342
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,834
Right. Come on, Bob.

343
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,072
Time for your medicine.
This is gonna make you feel better.

344
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,675
Look, what's that? Yeah, exactly.

345
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,674
All right, ready?

346
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,520
Open wide.

347
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,399
No, no, no, no. Come here.

348
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,072
Bob, look.
Yeah. Just down the hatch, mate.

349
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,034
Oi. Come back here, mister.

350
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,190
Come here.

351
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,716
Come here, oi. Hey.

352
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,034
No, Bob.

353
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,235
Bob!

354
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,435
Right. Okay.

355
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,357
Bob. Treat.

356
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,712
Right, mister.

357
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,960
Let's try this again.

358
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,830
Twice a day for two weeks, they said.

359
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,878
No, come here.

360
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,235
All right.

361
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,714
No, no, no. Stay here, stay here.

362
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,912
Stay here. Bob, Bob, Bob.

363
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,873
Oi! Come here, come here.

364
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,309
Wait, come here.

365
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,597
Look, what's that?
What's that? What's that?

366
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,592
What's that? What's that?

367
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,796
Bob!

368
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,998
It's all right, mate. It's okay.

369
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,430
I know.

370
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,472
I swear he wasn't like this earlier.

371
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,239
Well, I've had practice.

372
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,760
Did they tell you to bring him back
in a couple of weeks?

373
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,920
Yeah, that'll be a good time
to get him snipped.

374
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,597
- "Snipped"?
- Yeah, the man parts.

375
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,271
- But, I mean...
- Please, it isn't a big deal.

376
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,955
It's easy for you to say.
Besides, he's not even mine.

377
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,597
An intact male alone on the streets,
it's the worst life imaginable.

378
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,556
They fight for food,
they fight for territory.

379
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,313
Don't need to imagine that, do we?

380
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,757
If you can't give him a home,
at least give him a chance to stay alive.

381
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,917
Now, ordinarily, I don't touch meat...

382
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,117
...but Bob's gonna need some protein.

383
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,360
What do you do? How did you end up here?

384
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,592
- Me?
- Well, I know what he does.

385
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,958
- What have you got there?
- Allergy pill.

386
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,156
Right. I thought...

387
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,357
Otherwise, I am 100 percent anti-drug.

388
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,916
Lot of addicts in here.

389
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,240
I steer clear.

390
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,353
So, what do you do?
How did you end up here?

391
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,753
I'm a musician.

392
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,513
- I write songs and play.
- Yeah?

393
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,191
I haven't exactly been discovered yet...

394
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,911
...but I just moved in here, which is good.

395
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,713
From... Australia.

396
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,119
I've actually been back a while.

397
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,279
I've been sort of in between places,
I guess you could say.

398
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,070
But no, I got taken out there when
I was a kid when my parents split up.

399
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,119
And my mum took me out there,
and Dad stayed here.

400
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,795
He had his business to run...

401
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,714
- ...and didn't like flying, apparently.
- And you?

402
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,349
Well...

403
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,511
...she bought me a kitten, actually.

404
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,519
Dad, kitten. Kitten, Dad.

405
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,000
You must have missed him.

406
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,475
My dad?

407
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,154
It's a long story.

408
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,353
Long story, eh?

409
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,716
Val, I'm so sorry I missed our time.

410
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,600
Honestly, I tried to get there.
There were things...

411
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,070
- There was this cat, right?
- We have an agreement.

412
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,995
- You miss your appointment, you're out.
- And I met this girl, Betty.

413
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,956
I'm waiting for the part that explains
why you missed our appointment.

414
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,949
Is that blood on your coat?

415
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,756
- Must be Bob's.
- Who's Bob?

416
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,639
Bob's my cat I'm telling you about.

417
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,870
Well, not really mine.

418
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,111
- Betty's?
- No.

419
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,154
Betty's allergic.

420
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,556
But she told me to take him to the vet.

421
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,595
You seem a little rattled.

422
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,877
I'm trying to explain to you
why I missed our appointment.

423
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,918
Bob was hurt. He needed a vet.

424
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,391
- It took forever.
- How'd you pay for the vet?

425
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,597
My dad gave me some money.

426
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,035
You saw your dad?

427
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,034
Yeah. Bumped into him.

428
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,590
It didn't go very well.

429
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,876
This Betty...

430
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,360
...does she use?

431
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,875
No.

432
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,472
I put myself on the line for you.

433
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,200
- I know.
- Did you tell her you're in the program?

434
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,912
- I told her I was a musician.
- So you didn't tell her the truth.

435
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,594
Well...

436
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,514
...you've covered a lot of ground
since I last saw you.

437
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,038
- You can't take on too much too fast.
- Because I'm an emotional wreck?

438
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,357
Because feelings
aren't an addict's friend.

439
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,910
Bad, good, any feelings.

440
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,556
When was the last time
you were totally sober?

441
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,315
No weed, no brown, nothing.

442
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,195
When my parents split up, and I was...

443
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,477
You just couldn't deal with your emotions.

444
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,597
Emotions are still dangerous.

445
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,274
It's baby steps, James.

446
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,756
You're not ready for a relationship.

447
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,396
Another one?

448
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,753
You wanna go up high? Wanna go up high?

449
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,513
Go on, Bob.

450
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,034
Good boy.

451
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,352
You've got your strength back.

452
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,630
Hey.

453
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,554
Here he is.

454
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,119
Look at your collar.

455
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,556
Look at you. You're like
Shakespeare or something.

456
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,554
He's a little drowsy,
but the castration went well.

457
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,359
Please, don't even say the word.

458
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,079
I think he understands English.

459
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,720
Here you go.

460
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,112
It's okay. Does he hurt down there?

461
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,634
You big wally.

462
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,031
Do you know how many cats
we castrate every...

463
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,477
Perform the procedure on?

464
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,638
He won't even remember. Will you, Bob?

465
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,154
Yeah, I don't know about that.

466
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,120
You know, I was thinking, is he too thin?

467
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,394
You're keeping him, aren't you?

468
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,119
Well, I'd like to...

469
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,835
...but I can't. It wouldn't
be fair to him, would it?

470
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,749
Keep him cooped up all day?

471
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,270
He's a street cat.

472
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,675
His weight's fine.
He should be good to go in a week.

473
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,275
Okay.

474
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,995
Thank you.

475
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,633
Oi. I know, I know.

476
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,436
No, don't look at me like that.

477
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,710
It's for your own good.

478
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,794
Hey. It wasn't my idea.
You can take it up with Betty.

479
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,755
Okay, look.

480
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,799
I'll take that off if you promise
not to lick the stitches.

481
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,235
Okay?

482
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,673
Right. No, it's okay.

483
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,912
Now, you hold still there, okay?

484
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,594
Okay, Bob.

485
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,717
Let me just take this off.
Okay, that's it.

486
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,112
That is a good boy.
Okay, here we go. There you go.

487
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,759
Hey, look at this.

488
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,234
Come on.

489
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,833
See, there you go.

490
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,959
Yeah, I'm your hero now.

491
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,476
You wait till you realize
you've got no bits left.

492
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,554
Morning, mate.

493
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,589
No, no, no, Bob!

494
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,079
Bob, Bob, Bob. No.

495
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,113
Naughty.

496
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,872
Do I not feed you enough?

497
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,792
You only eat what I give you, yeah?

498
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,998
Not the neighbors.

499
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,190
And you...

500
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,914
...don't come back.

501
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,595
No, look, Bob. Bob.
I've gotta go to work, all right?

502
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,474
I can't take care of you.

503
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,074
I wish I could...

504
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,352
...but I can't.

505
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,479
Look at the big world out there
waiting for you.

506
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,832
Go and explore it.

507
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,914
That's it. Good boy.

508
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,440
So long, Bob.

509
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,638
Come on. This is silly now.

510
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,634
What did I just say?
You're gonna get yourself run over.

511
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,599
Hey, it's not safe out here.

512
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,480
I mean it. You can't come with me.

513
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,354
Seriously, you'd be surprised
how much he understands.

514
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,114
Hey, Bob.

515
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,312
Go on, go back to the grass.

516
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,317
Go on. Good boy.

517
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,834
Good boy.

518
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,353
Darling, look.

519
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,192
What are you doing here?
Hey, no, don't go over there.

520
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,995
He's not even my cat.
He's just followed me onto the bus.

521
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,879
Haven't you, eh?

522
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,592
- Isn't he lovely?
- Is it okay that he's on here?

523
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,229
- I don't know. Have you paid for him?
- Two for one?

524
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,714
Hey, do you wanna go up here?

525
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,519
There you go.

526
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,116
That's a good view.

527
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,634
Yeah.

528
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,674
What are you doing,
following me into town, hey?

529
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,080
Hey, Bob, look.

530
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,310
Look at those, eh?

531
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,274
Yeah, you're a lion. You're a lion.

532
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,639
Yeah.

533
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,832
They've got nothing on you, mate.

534
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,355
- Here. Would this help, love?
- That's perfect.

535
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,876
- That's good. It's a bit thicker.
- Yeah.

536
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,117
- Not too tight, now.
- No, I know.

537
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,597
It's just if he gets spooked in town.
I don't want him to run off.

538
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,638
He's not actually mine. He's a stray.

539
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,878
- He doesn't look like a stray to me.
- Yeah, I know.

540
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,710
Good boy.

541
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,711
Come on. Come on, Bob. This way.

542
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,554
We won't make any money here, mate.
Come on, this way.

543
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,710
Good boy.

544
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,314
On we go.

545
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,750
Bob, Bob, Bob!

546
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,390
Sorry.

547
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,280
Good boy. That's enough shopping
for one day.

548
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,319
Bob. Come on.

549
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,470
Come on.

550
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,434
I'll tell you what.
You jump up here, okay?

551
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,838
We haven't got all day. Come on.

552
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,230
Good boy.

553
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,516
Is that better up there?

554
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,434
This is Covent Garden.

555
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,199
You okay, Bob?

556
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,040
Look at his cat!

557
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,432
- I could eat you up!
- She doesn't mean it.

558
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,950
He's gorgeous.

559
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,395
Thank you.

560
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,549
Look at that. I'd like to see you do that.

561
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,316
- Hey!
- Hi.

562
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,472
- Can I have a photo?
- Yeah, okay. Sure.

563
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,279
Say cheese, Bob.

564
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,479
- All right?
- Thanks!

565
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,310
You're quite the little party piece,
aren't you?

566
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,238
Look, it's so cute!

567
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,516
It's a cat!

568
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,756
Hi.

569
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,435
Wanna say hello?

570
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,517
We're playing now over there
so if you wanna come and watch, then...

571
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,955
- You want to?
- Yeah!

572
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,271
Good work, getting the punters in.

573
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,320
High-five. Hey, high-five.

574
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,600
Do you know what just happened?

575
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,674
Look at this!

576
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,389
You are a wonderful little being,
aren't you?

577
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,157
Got yourself a lovely ginger, all right.

578
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,750
Yeah.

579
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,833
I had a ginger tom just like him once.

580
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,879
Loved him with all me heart.

581
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,191
- He's got a mind of his own.
- That's the point.

582
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,074
The gingers, got wills like iron,
they have.

583
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,556
Mine wouldn't leave my side
till his last breath.

584
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,351
You got yourself a lifelong partner there.

585
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,557
Better friends than people, they are.

586
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,360
Believe me.

587
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,751
Is that right, Bob? Good boy.

588
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,670
Hey, mister.

589
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,991
You have put in a shift today,
haven't you?

590
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,556
Yeah. You wanna come again tomorrow?

591
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,234
The bright lights?

592
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,080
Here, look.

593
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,710
This could be you, Bob.

594
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,360
Your name in lights. Look.

595
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,037
You wanna get some food when we get home?

596
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,991
Dinner is served.

597
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,271
You played a blinder.

598
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,235
There you go.

599
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,716
Bob.

600
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,235
Bob!

601
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,878
Yeah, you're gonna be a professional
cat-harness wearer now.

602
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,399
What do you think about that?

603
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,512
Hello, stranger.

604
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,396
- Hi.
- Haven't seen you around.

605
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,960
What's with the sign?

606
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,756
I'm going on a march
to free farmed animals.

607
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,956
Free what?

608
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,600
Cows, pigs, chickens.

609
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,830
Turkeys.

610
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,832
You want them just running in the street?

611
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,751
We want them not to be murdered.
Don't tell me you're a carnivore.

612
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,479
I've never really thought about it.

613
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,916
Well, think about it.

614
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,673
Every bite you take,
you're eating suffering.

615
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,513
Living all posh now, huh?

616
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,909
Off the streets and all?

617
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,759
What are you doing here?

618
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,830
I just thought I'd follow a friendly face.

619
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,714
I thought maybe I could
crash with you for a bit, you know.

620
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,273
Spread the wealth about a bit.

621
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,478
- Hello, kitty.
- Hey! Go away, Baz, all right?

622
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,199
I mean it.

623
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,635
Come on, anything.

624
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,230
I had a bit of hard lines, man.

625
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,638
James, please.

626
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,830
Please, James.

627
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,514
Look at you.

628
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,796
All right...

629
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,314
- This is for food, Baz. All right?
- Promise. Yeah, for food.

630
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,800
- Please promise me.
- Honestly.

631
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,394
- Yeah, I promise.
- I mean it.

632
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,475
You need to
look after yourself, all right?

633
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,951
- Please, Baz, just buy some food.
- I promise. I swear.

634
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,200
And don't come back here, all right?

635
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,113
Nice cat.

636
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,560
Thank you.

637
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,396
Thank you very much.

638
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,273
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Brilliant.

639
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,557
- Hi.
- I hope you don't mind...

640
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,951
...I got Bob a little something
for Christmas.

641
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,910
Look at that, Bob! You want a bit of that?

642
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,676
- And I made him a little something.
- You shouldn't have.

643
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,797
Thank you. Look at that!

644
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,758
- I think he likes it.
- Thank you so much.

645
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,832
- You're an angel.
- I wouldn't go that far.

646
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,912
I wasn't always a little old lady.

647
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,549
Thank you.

648
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,758
Look at that, Bob.
You're gonna have that later.

649
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,755
Hi, Betty.

650
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,240
Look at Bob.

651
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,673
Doctor Who's twin.

652
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,830
Love the scarf.

653
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,600
- Yeah. Just got it.
- You all right? You look tired.

654
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,515
I've been busy. Or rather, he has.

655
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,751
I've been demoted to sidekick.

656
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,832
I'm starving. Can I cook you dinner?

657
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,190
Anything...

658
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,794
...as long as it's tuna.

659
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,792
I'm level four. Vegan.

660
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,550
- I have no idea what you just said.
- I don't eat anything that casts a shadow.

661
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,757
You don't get shadows underwater, do you?

662
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,031
How about this, I will cook you dinner.

663
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,754
If you give me an hour.

664
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,036
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

665
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,278
- Okay. An hour. No more, no less.
- Okay.

666
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,676
I think this is a date, Bob.

667
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,711
So who did all these paintings?

668
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,031
Only the most talented painter I know.

669
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,390
- Well, that narrows it down.
- Steamed seitan with miso.

670
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,040
- Just eat it. It's good for you.
- Yeah.

671
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,880
I'm actually painting my flat as well.

672
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,839
Maybe not quite like this, but...

673
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,754
I can see.

674
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,869
I just bloody bought this.

675
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,358
I've got some turps in the kitchen
if you want.

676
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,556
Thanks.

677
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,110
Painting, buying. Life must be good.

678
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,870
Feels like I'm joining the real world
after all these years, you know?

679
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,440
- Meaning?
- Just...

680
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,957
You know I said
about my parents splitting up?

681
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,793
I just got moved around a lot and...

682
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,391
You went off the rails a bit?
A little angry, a little wild?

683
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,152
Yeah, you could say that.

684
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,275
But, anyway, what about you?

685
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,395
More wine?

686
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,480
Thank you.

687
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,232
All right. We need some real food, Bob.
What's it gonna be?

688
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,235
Want some hot dogs?

689
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,792
No? Okay.

690
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,594
Right, so, what do you fancy?

691
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,479
Wild Pacific pink salmon?

692
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,960
Is that a yes?
Okay, we'll get one of them.

693
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,430
What else?

694
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,796
Some tuna?

695
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,150
Yeah?

696
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,232
Yeah. That's a yes for that as well.

697
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,198
What else?

698
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,477
Boneless sardines?

699
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,197
Yeah, you want that, don't you?

700
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,231
Okay. That's good.

701
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,310
Salmon, tuna, sardines. Good to go?

702
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,990
All right.

703
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,513
We are gonna eat like kings tomorrow, Bob.

704
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,634
I'll tell you what.

705
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,518
- We'll get these as well.
- Of course.

706
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,949
Like them?

707
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,232
Bob. They're for Betty.

708
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,754
Thank you, Bob.

709
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,990
Hello?

710
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,394
Hello?

711
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,197
Oh, no. Please. Bob, down.

712
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,835
Baz. Baz, wake up.

713
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,469
Wake up, Baz. Wake up! Come on, wake up.

714
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,030
Baz? Hello? Wake up. Can you hear me?

715
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,709
Baz. Wake up.
Can somebody call an ambulance?

716
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,557
No, Bob, get away from that.

717
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,880
Hey, Baz. Come on.

718
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,436
Wake up. Help! Call an ambulance!

719
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,718
- They're on the way!
- Baz, listen to me. Come on.

720
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,956
James!

721
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,630
- Has he OD'd?
- Yeah.

722
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,513
- Have you checked his airways?
- No.

723
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,830
Help me get him back.

724
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,316
Okay, come on.

725
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,315
Is he breathing?

726
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,153
Baz, come on!

727
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,595
Come on, Baz, wake up.

728
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,030
Come on, come on!

729
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,520
- He's OD'd.
- What's his name?

730
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,478
- Baz.
- Hello, Baz, can you hear me?

731
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,950
- You know what he's taken?
- Heroin, heroin.

732
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,753
How old is he, do you know?

733
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,037
- He's, like, 20.
- Baz, can you hear me?

734
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,277
What have we got,
he's in respiratory arrest.

735
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,159
It's okay, Bob. It's okay.

736
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,800
One, two, three, lift.

737
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,196
Move back, please, move back!

738
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,113
Give us some room.

739
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,991
I know a bit about addicts.

740
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,035
I was in Sheffield...

741
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,477
...studying a veterinary course.

742
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,600
My parents didn't call.

743
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,236
They drove up and told me.

744
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,635
My brother was everything to me.

745
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,476
Protector, teacher.

746
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,791
He was the best painter I ever knew.

747
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,235
This was your...

748
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,632
Your brother's place.

749
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,520
He died right back there
in the bathroom...

750
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,671
...needle still in his arm.

751
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,320
Twenty-eight.

752
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,837
- So why did you...?
- Move in here?

753
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,314
To be near him.

754
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,589
He tried...

755
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,480
...so hard, to get clean.

756
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,715
But I guess that he didn't want it enough.

757
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,032
Or could want it enough.

758
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,878
But he couldn't do it...

759
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,399
...not even for me.

760
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,560
I thought you wanted clean.

761
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,040
I do. God, of course I do.

762
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,395
Then why not now?

763
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,075
I'm ready to come off the methadone.

764
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,230
It's a process, James.

765
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,676
It's my job to manage
the process with you.

766
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,954
I'm down to 10 ml.

767
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,909
Let's revisit this after the holidays.
God knows they're hard enough as it is.

768
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,599
Hey, you're doing great.

769
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,558
I just... I want...

770
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,236
I wanna be clean.
I want to live a life, you know?

771
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,873
This kid I knew, Baz...

772
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,590
He...

773
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,275
He OD'd. He died.

774
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,193
And I don't wanna go that way.

775
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,760
I know.

776
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,673
After the holidays.

777
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,710
Yeah?

778
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,478
Look, I've got another appointment.

779
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,350
Okay.

780
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,270
Hey, no.

781
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,990
Come on.

782
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,880
- What are you doing for Christmas?
- Betty said she'd spend it with me...

783
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,670
...as long as I didn't mention the words
"Christmas" or "merry" in any order.

784
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,830
My kind of girl.

785
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,469
Ho, ho, ho, Happy Cats-mas!

786
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,950
- What's all this?
- Happy Cats-mas, Bob.

787
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,430
New girlfriend for you. This is Bobina.

788
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,640
- He's not impressed.
- Sorry.

789
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,632
- He will. Just playing hard to get.
- Don't panic, by the way.

790
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,510
This isn't a you-know-what tree.
No, it's a lamp tree.

791
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,319
Taste like turkey?

792
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,557
- Not even vaguely.
- It does!

793
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,393
- Tastes like rubber.
- No, it doesn't!

794
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,917
It's nice, but what I think is
that if you're gonna eat tofu...

795
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,198
...why pretend it's turkey,
or burgers or whatever?

796
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,397
It's like giving tofu
an inferiority complex.

797
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,233
Let it be who it wants to be.

798
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,834
"I am tofu.

799
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,593
I am inedible."

800
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,797
- It's not inedible!
- No.

801
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,280
- Give it to Bob to try.
- Okay.

802
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,915
- He's a better judge than you.
- Bob? What's that?

803
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,360
What's that?

804
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,398
I think we'll take that as a "no."

805
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,200
I love it!

806
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,670
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

807
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,677
Right, so I'll read this to you, mate.

808
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,870
Look.

809
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,759
"Dear James and Boblet...

810
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,276
...happy Cat-mas.
Lots of purrs and whiskers.

811
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,715
From Betty."

812
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,830
Good, right?

813
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,990
Thank you.

814
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,594
Is this one of your brother's?

815
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,750
Yeah.

816
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,149
And it's just out...

817
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,674
Yeah, just out there.

818
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,035
Betty, that is so beautiful.

819
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,430
Come on.

820
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,991
- No. No, I can't sing.
- Yes you can.

821
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,350
It's awful. Horrible.

822
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,556
Come on.

823
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,790
Bob!

824
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,840
I don't know. Is it crazy?

825
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,951
What, surprising your dad
and his new family on New Year's Eve...

826
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,397
...when they've given no indication
that they want you there?

827
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,717
Yeah, well, when you put it like that...

828
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,357
But he didn't exactly say I couldn't come.

829
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,558
And, I don't know, things have been
going pretty good lately.

830
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,035
Do you ever wonder
why people kiss with their lips?

831
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,998
I mean, why not...

832
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,358
...rub ears like, "I want to hear you."

833
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,032
Or wrists, like this.

834
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,877
Hey, you did way too many threes!
And there's not even a seven on the dice.

835
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,078
- You cheated. You have to go back.
- If you cheat, I get an extra card!

836
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,311
That's cheating.
You've gotta put that back.

837
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,359
Can't you play quietly? Come on.
Have you cleaned your teeth?

838
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,992
- You can't cheat! That's cheating!
- Oh, come on! For goodness' sake.

839
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,719
Happy families, eh, Bob?

840
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,470
All right, come on. We've got this far.

841
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,399
Girls! Come and clean this up.

842
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,199
You know what?

843
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,510
Let's put you under here.

844
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,440
- Girls, they'll be here in a minute.
- Two surprise guests...

845
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,838
...might be more than they can handle.
No, come on. Come on.

846
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,320
Good boy.

847
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,716
There's the door now. All right!

848
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,034
Happy New Year.

849
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,635
Thanks.

850
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,190
How are you doing? All right?

851
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,714
Nice house.

852
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,230
- Hi, kids.
- Girls, you remember your brother.

853
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,239
Pris, Faith, this is James.

854
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,960
You've grown up so much
since I last saw you.

855
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,591
What were you playing in there?
Dad and I used to play Trivial Pursuit.

856
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,790
- You remember?
- Yes.

857
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,759
You let me play the adult version
that weekend before I left for Melbourne.

858
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,990
- Did I?
- Yeah.

859
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,150
She was cheating.

860
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,674
And Mummy doesn't like you.

861
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,160
Mummy says you're a junkie.

862
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,835
- I didn't cheat, you cheated.
- Did not, you cheated!

863
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,071
- She says I'm a junkie.
- Stop it, girls!

864
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,391
- Where did she get that idea from?
- Stop it.

865
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:18,914
You can't be here.
We've got guests coming.

866
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,400
Girls! Mummy will be down in a minute.

867
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,835
I thought you said
New Year's would be okay.

868
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,276
I said "maybe." You should have called.

869
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,318
He's a junkie. He's a junkie.

870
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,119
- Will you leave the tree alone?
- James is a junkie!

871
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,873
A recovering addict, actually.

872
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,792
- Daddy, he's got a cat!
- What the hell?

873
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,674
Hey, kids, meet Bob.

874
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,711
Hey, hey hey! Bob! Bob!

875
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,114
- Pris, leave it!
- Come here, Bob.

876
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,749
- Faith, stop screaming!
- Jack, what is going on?

877
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,115
They're coming at 8:00.

878
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,475
It's James.

879
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,637
Hey, Hilary. Happy New Year. Bob.

880
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:53,033
- What's he doing here? Faith.
- Mummy, Mummy! He's got a cat!

881
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,112
- But she's allergic!
- I know!

882
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,555
Bob!

883
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,672
- Pris, stop chasing...
- Get that thing out of here!

884
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,752
- She'll have an attack.
- I'm trying.

885
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,838
- James, please.
- Come on, Bob. Come on.

886
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,072
- Come here. Bob, come on, mate.
- For goodness' sake, James.

887
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,873
- Bob!
- No!

888
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,390
That was my mother's.

889
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:14,835
I know.

890
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,839
Bob. Bob. I'm so sorry.

891
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,633
- Get out of my house!
- Bob!

892
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,150
- You and your creature, just get out!
- Come on.

893
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,114
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

894
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,434
Okay, come on. It's okay.

895
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,199
- Calm down.
- How did he get in?

896
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,074
He's my son. You think I'd
close the door in his face?

897
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,640
- What have I told you!
- Let's get your lead on.

898
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,200
- What?
- Don't let him in!

899
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,635
I want to stroke him.

900
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,800
- Can I?
- Yeah, you can try.

901
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,953
- He's so cute.
- When he's here everything goes wrong!

902
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,000
- How old is he?
- I don't know.

903
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,275
- I want a kitten.
- He's never allowed into this house!

904
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,480
My friend Sammy has a kitten.

905
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,233
Make sure he's out of here!

906
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,276
Happy New Year, Dad.

907
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,550
Thanks.

908
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,196
Nice to see you again.

909
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,720
Cats are weird.

910
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,920
Go on, right there.

911
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,231
- That's it. Go on.
- Hey!

912
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,518
- Piss off, you moron!
- Looks more like "piss on" to me.

913
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,400
Get that dog away from here.
I'm trying to play here. Come on.

914
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,280
- Come on.
- What?

915
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,955
- Don't touch me.
- Can you get that person out of here?

916
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,471
- It's all right, Bob. It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Shut up!

917
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,439
Oi, back off! Back off!

918
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,315
I've got a cat under here!

919
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,359
Oi! Oi! That's enough!

920
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,074
- Give it up!
- Hey!

921
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,390
It's him, it's not me!

922
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,000
The dog needed a piss.

923
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,914
It's your fault! It's that dog!
I've got a cat in here!

924
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,273
CCTV proved it wasn't your fault.

925
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,716
But you're prohibited from busking
for six months.

926
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:53,996
I said where's Bob?

927
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,317
Do you want to thank me for
coming down here and bailing you out?

928
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,154
Maybe you can focus.
You can't go back to Covent Garden.

929
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,358
- You're banned from busking.
- I wanna know where my cat is!

930
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,160
- You missed your meds, didn't you?
- I just wanna know where Bob is.

931
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:09,314
He's safe. He's in the police kennel.
We can go and get him right now.

932
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,357
You got yourself arrested,
and you didn't get your methadone.

933
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,749
James.

934
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,070
You are so close.

935
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,390
Don't lose it now.

936
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,434
It wasn't my fault, none of this.
It wasn't my fault.

937
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,040
I'm gonna call the chemist...

938
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,750
...authorize them to give it to you
even though you missed it yesterday.

939
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,072
You go straight there. I'll get Bob. Okay?

940
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,960
Hello.

941
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,351
If you fail to show up any day,
we can't give you the medication.

942
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,274
But she called you, didn't she?
My key worker, she called?

943
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,840
I'm just warning you.

944
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,230
Okay.

945
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,072
- Sign.
- Yeah.

946
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,150
Come on, man.

947
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,672
- Let me explain!
- What's to explain? I have eyes, James.

948
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,832
You're an addict. You lied to me!

949
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,320
No, I didn't!

950
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,154
- I just shaded the truth a little.
- Oh, please!

951
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,829
Wait, look! Okay, yeah,
I'm on the methadone program...

952
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,755
...but I haven't used for three months.
Believe me. I am trying to get clean.

953
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,877
I can't be around addicts.
I told you that.

954
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,037
It's just, it's too much...

955
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,836
I can't do it.
And I wasn't shading the truth.

956
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,635
This dog came after Bob,
and I was trying to protect him.

957
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,111
And then this whole fight broke out,
and then I got arrested.

958
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,078
I wasn't doing anything wrong.
It wasn't my fault.

959
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,914
Now I can't busk. If I do,
then I'll get arrested again.

960
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:41,118
And then I don't know
what will even happen to Bob.

961
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,351
If you can't sing,
you can't make any money.

962
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,517
And if you do sing, you'll get arrested.

963
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,275
And all you're thinking about
is what happens to the cat!

964
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,679
<i>When you sell our magazine,</i>
<i>you get out what you put in.</i>

965
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,111
You know how they say
weed is a gateway drug?

966
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,351
Yeah, I'm a little familiar
with the concept.

967
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,916
Well, <i>The Big Issue</i>
is a gateway opportunity.

968
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,517
I'll start you off with a handful of free ones.
Just like a pusher, right?

969
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,717
You sell them, the next ones
you buy from us.

970
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,714
Sell those, make a little profit,
buy even more.

971
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,590
After a while, you get better territories,
work your way up, etcetera.

972
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,752
Before you know it,
you're Rupert Murdock...

973
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,115
...except not a dickhead.

974
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,431
If you can't sell them,
we don't buy them back.

975
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,750
So you gotta plan.

976
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,838
You get one designated territory. Get it?

977
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,793
Poach on anyone else, and you're done.

978
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,639
Period. Boom. Clear?

979
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,354
- Boom. Clear.
- Good.

980
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,072
You can't have an animal in your photo.

981
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,072
- This is your official ID.
- What animal?

982
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,357
I don't see an animal.
This is my co-pilot.

983
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,193
Yeah, I heard about that.

984
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,714
Okay.

985
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,075
Look this way.

986
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,118
Say "cheese," Bob.

987
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,230
You know what?

988
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,511
I might have just the right thing
for you two.

989
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,320
It'll cost a tenner, but it's worth it.

990
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,791
<i>Big Issue! Big Issue!</i>

991
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,920
<i>Big Issue!</i> Come on, guys! Give it a try!
Help Bob and I! <i>Big Issue!</i>

992
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:47,232
- Hey. <i>Big Issue?</i>
- Can I have a selfie with the cat?

993
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,313
You take a picture,
and then you buy a paper. How's that?

994
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,240
- Is that a deal?
- You are a good businessman. I like it.

995
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,999
Come on, Bob, look at the camera.

996
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,436
- There you go.
- Thank you.

997
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,160
He wants to give you a high-five.
High-five, Bob.

998
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:03,034
- High-five there.
- That's £2.50.

999
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,391
I've only got £2.30. Is that all right?

1000
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,597
- I can see that's £2.50.
- I'll owe it to you.

1001
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,240
- Excuse me, mate.
- Hey, mate.

1002
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,595
Hello. Peter Gruner.

1003
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,116
- I'm from the <i>Islington Tribune.</i>
- Thank you.

1004
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,192
Would you mind if I did a story
on you and the cat?

1005
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,070
- Are you taking the mick?
- Can I pet him?

1006
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,790
- You can try. Just behind the ears.
- See? You're a human interest story.

1007
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,280
- What's that?
- Would you mind?

1008
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,513
Oh, right. Yeah, sure.

1009
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,359
Look this way, Bob.

1010
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,715
Bob, look over there.

1011
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,394
Bob! Lovely.

1012
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,556
- Let me get another one. Hang on.
<i>- Big Issue!</i>

1013
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,995
<i>Big Issue.</i>

1014
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,152
No, Bob cat. Bob cat.

1015
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,512
<i>Big Issue. Big Issue.</i>

1016
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,110
<i>Big Issue.</i>

1017
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,800
Bloody stupid cat.

1018
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,510
Hey, mate.

1019
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,716
Go screw yourself.

1020
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,520
Hey, watch your mouth.
I've got a minor here.

1021
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:23,279
Excuse me, sir.

1022
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,033
Sir! Sir.

1023
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,516
- Me?
- Can I take a picture of you and your cat?

1024
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,876
- Please?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

1025
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,113
It's okay, Bob. He likes your hat.

1026
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,395
- Great.
- Thank you. Can we buy a magazine?

1027
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,280
Sorry, it's not my patch.
You've got to speak to that guy.

1028
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,510
We really wanna help.

1029
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,080
- You can't...
- Thank you.

1030
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,311
- Have a great day.
- Okay. All right. And you.

1031
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,835
Come on, I wasn't poaching.
He knows I wasn't poaching.

1032
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,559
My patch, you're selling papers.

1033
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,313
- What else do you call it?
- Envy.

1034
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,194
- Envy? I'll envy your arse...
- Stop! Stop it!

1035
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,716
- James, you knew the rules.
- I wasn't selling...

1036
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,109
One month, no papers.

1037
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,875
Come on! Don't do this.
I wasn't selling, I promise you.

1038
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,396
There was this one couple.
You saw what happened.

1039
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,199
So they forced you to sell to them?

1040
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,716
- I wasn't trying to...
- Look, you're taking business off me.

1041
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,553
Why are you making this up?
Why are you picking on me?

1042
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,791
- You took the money. Yeah?
- Enough. Enough.

1043
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,996
One month, no papers.

1044
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,755
What?

1045
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,120
Nothing.

1046
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,159
Just the chaos.

1047
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,596
Chaos around drug addicts?

1048
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,037
Where life's a constant shit storm...

1049
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,554
...that kind of chaos?

1050
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,717
Bob, put the frog down.

1051
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,350
Leave it.

1052
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:20,990
One, two...

1053
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:22,870
Thanks, there you go.

1054
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,238
I'll leave that one.
That's for the tuna. Thank you.

1055
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,429
Come on. There you go.

1056
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,394
You need this more than me.

1057
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,794
Thank you.

1058
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,070
Cheers.

1059
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,789
Thank you.

1060
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,599
Come on, Bob.

1061
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,072
Mate, there's nothing there.

1062
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,472
It's empty, mate.

1063
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,270
Bob...

1064
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,479
Bob, stop it.

1065
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,551
Give it a rest, mate. Come on.

1066
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,629
Bob.

1067
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,759
Stop it!

1068
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,320
I'm sorry.

1069
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,913
I know. I know you're hungry, buddy.

1070
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,473
I'm sorry.

1071
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,392
I'll find a way, okay?

1072
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,518
I'll find a way.

1073
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,640
James. What are you doing?

1074
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,759
- Betty. Hi. I'm just...
- Wait, you've been banned from busking.

1075
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,673
Well, Bob's hungry, I'm hungry...

1076
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,830
If you get arrested...

1077
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,191
- ...you won't be able to feed Bob.
- They're not gonna arrest me here.

1078
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,556
What, do you think
you're just above the rules?

1079
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,598
Like they don't apply to you? So typical.

1080
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,112
- Typical of what, Betty?
- Stop it.

1081
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,272
- No, go on, say it. Let them hear.
- Stop it.

1082
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,238
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to eat?

1083
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,710
- I don't know.
- What do you want me to do...

1084
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,554
...just erase the last 20 years of my life
and start over?

1085
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,710
I don't know!

1086
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,075
I would if I could.

1087
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,197
Do you know
who shouts like this in public?

1088
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,717
Junkies do. And the people
who fall in love with them, that's who.

1089
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,032
I can't do this again.

1090
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,639
I didn't like it any more than you.

1091
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,356
Those are the rules.

1092
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,034
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

1093
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,635
James.

1094
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,270
Watch yourself, okay?

1095
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,869
Yeah.

1096
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,960
<i>Big Issue!</i> Give it a try! Help Bob and I!

1097
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,634
<i>Big Issue.</i> Come on.

1098
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,830
Yes, mate.

1099
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,516
Thank you very much.

1100
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,599
- He's adorable.
- This is Bob. You wanna say hello?

1101
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,989
- Say hello.
- Hi!

1102
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,835
- Yeah. Care for a <i>Big Issue,</i> madam?
- Oh, yes.

1103
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,674
- Actually, we came to see the cat.
- Oh, yeah?

1104
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,797
- Graham can't stop talking about him.
- Where's he from?

1105
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,156
He's beautiful, isn't he? I found him.

1106
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,875
- Do you like Bob? £2.50, please.
- All right.

1107
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,635
- Yeah. He's my best mate.
- You want the best for him...

1108
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,956
- There you go.
- ...all of that.

1109
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,640
Thank you very much. Of course.

1110
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,996
What I mean is,
I'd be willing to take him.

1111
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,753
Well, to buy him.

1112
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,800
- How much?
- He's not for sale.

1113
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,720
Obviously this isn't the
best environment for an animal...

1114
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,991
- Please.
- ...living on the street and all.

1115
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,356
- Yes, all right, darling.
- We've got a flat...

1116
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,671
We'd be able to give him
all the things you can't...

1117
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,433
- ...like a decent home.
- He's not for sale.

1118
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,314
- I'm sure you could use cash.
- No, I don't want your money.

1119
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,200
How about how much for your kid?
I'll trade you.

1120
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,511
- I'll give him a decent home.
- Excuse me?

1121
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,956
How dare you. That's exceptionally rude.

1122
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,236
Bob!

1123
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,079
Hey! No!

1124
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,595
Bob!

1125
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,476
Come back!

1126
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,559
Bob!

1127
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,114
Bob!

1128
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,994
Bob!

1129
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,390
Bob!

1130
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:45,990
Thank you so much.

1131
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,793
Excuse me, did you see a cat here?

1132
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,394
A ginger cat? No?

1133
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:52,915
Bob!

1134
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,190
Bob!

1135
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,435
Bob!

1136
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,470
Bob!

1137
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,356
Bob.

1138
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,197
Come on, mate. Where are you?

1139
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,555
Bob?

1140
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,069
Bob?

1141
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,599
What if a dog got him? Or a car, or...

1142
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,593
I can't...

1143
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,879
It's been two nights, you know.

1144
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,360
Look, I'm not saying this is it...

1145
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,274
...but maybe Bob did
what he was meant to do.

1146
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,116
He's a cat. Cats are independent animals.

1147
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,351
It's my own stupid fault.

1148
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,512
I wasn't watching him.

1149
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:47,233
You know,
I promised I'd take care of him...

1150
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,913
...but I wasn't watching him.

1151
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,474
This isn't a time
you wanna be on your own.

1152
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,997
- What about your dad, or Betty?
- No, I need to...

1153
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,274
I need to get home.
I need to wait for him there.

1154
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,994
Maybe he'll come back.

1155
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,560
I really think you should
have someone with you.

1156
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,313
He might come back, mightn't he?

1157
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,880
He might do, yeah.

1158
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,520
He could come home, couldn't he?

1159
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,193
James.

1160
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,839
I know these two.

1161
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,356
I used to see them all the time
when he was singing.

1162
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,874
But look at this.

1163
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,191
This guy and his cat are all over YouTube.

1164
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,350
Look at the hits.

1165
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,550
Over a million.

1166
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,833
They're on Instagram. And Facebook.

1167
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,716
That is so cute.

1168
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,516
Look at that.

1169
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,320
- Incredible.
- So you're thinking a book?

1170
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,634
You looking for paradise?

1171
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,599
Because I've got it all here.

1172
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,719
White, brown, whatever you like.

1173
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,353
I want my cat.

1174
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,871
I'm looking for a ginger cat.

1175
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,952
Have you seen it anywhere?

1176
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:11,909
Yeah.

1177
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,320
Bob! Bob!

1178
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,076
Hey.

1179
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,873
Hey, mister.

1180
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,432
Where have you been, hey?

1181
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,080
Where have you been?

1182
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,119
Oh, Bob.

1183
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,114
Where have you been?

1184
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,790
I'm ready.

1185
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,275
I think you are, too.

1186
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,391
It's about weathering the tests, James.

1187
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,071
"Can I do it straight?"
That's always an addict's question.

1188
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,914
Think of the worst flu you've ever had.

1189
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,835
Multiply that by a hundred.
Do you know what "riding the bike" is?

1190
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:13,114
When you can't keep your legs still
even when you're lying down.

1191
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,835
For a week, every day will be a fight.

1192
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,720
Every hour, a struggle
not to go out and score.

1193
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,154
It's harder coming off methadone
than kicking heroin.

1194
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,312
You can't do it on your own.

1195
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,194
I'm not.

1196
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,596
I've got him. He got me this far.

1197
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:34,111
The other day, we were selling papers,
and this guy came up to us.

1198
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,555
Really well-dressed...

1199
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,798
...the sort that wouldn't wanna
share the pavement with me before.

1200
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,072
He called me "sir."

1201
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,555
"Sir, do you mind if I take your picture?"

1202
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,676
No one's ever called me "sir" before.

1203
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,073
And it's because of Bob.

1204
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,551
He's shown me what life could be like...

1205
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,952
...on the other side.

1206
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:21,994
Betty?

1207
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,954
I know you're in there.

1208
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,394
I just wanted to say you're not gonna
see me for a few days.

1209
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,517
Val's given me the go-ahead.

1210
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,479
So I'm doing it.

1211
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,633
I'm sorry that I've disappointed you.

1212
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,550
After all this...

1213
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,632
...I'll make it up to you.

1214
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,830
I'll make it up to everyone I ever knew.

1215
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,190
I just wanted to let you know.

1216
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,678
You're gonna need food, a stockpile...

1217
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:20,117
...because any excuse to go outside,
and you're gonna try and score.

1218
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,551
Let me bring you the food.
Then lock the door.

1219
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,953
Tofu?

1220
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,597
I'll make an exception this once.

1221
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,035
Okay.

1222
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:33,352
But that's all.
I don't want you to see me like that.

1223
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,990
And I've got Bob.

1224
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,680
He'll look after me.

1225
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,549
<i>Bob!</i>

1226
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,990
Hey.

1227
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,599
Hey, mister.

1228
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,112
I'm proud of you, James.

1229
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,117
So, what are you gonna do now?

1230
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,839
Well, first thing...

1231
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,356
...I'm gonna try and find
a way to thank you.

1232
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:17,830
Come here.

1233
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,672
All right, come on, mister.
Let's go. Come on.

1234
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,789
Yeah.

1235
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,713
You take care of yourself.

1236
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,670
And you.

1237
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,599
Thanks, Val.

1238
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,439
Come on, mate.

1239
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,760
Coming.

1240
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,555
Yeah, that one too.

1241
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,154
I'll go in, yeah?

1242
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,559
Wanna give us a hand with this?

1243
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:50,989
Ready.

1244
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,152
Sorry, I don't know
why the door was shut...

1245
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,113
- Hi.
- Hi.

1246
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,233
Look at you.

1247
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:00,789
You did it.

1248
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,633
Yeah, just.

1249
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:06,029
- You look great.
- Thanks.

1250
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,554
How do you feel?

1251
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,351
Yeah, now I feel good.

1252
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:14,640
Same...

1253
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,440
...but totally different.

1254
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:19,195
What's going on? You're moving.

1255
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,430
Yeah.

1256
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,074
I'm going home for a while.

1257
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,315
- Right.
- I can't stay here.

1258
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,953
It's not my life.

1259
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,673
It was my brother's...

1260
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,872
...and I need to move on.

1261
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,958
- Yeah.
- You actually helped me see that.

1262
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,150
Good.

1263
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:38,436
Yeah.

1264
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,989
It doesn't necessarily mean goodbye.

1265
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,512
- No.
- Wait.

1266
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,710
For you.

1267
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,951
I made this one.

1268
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:59,551
- You just have to hang it over...
- Yeah, I know what these are.

1269
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,150
Thank you.

1270
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,677
That's my address.
It's my parents' address.

1271
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,799
- That's where I'll be staying.
- Elizabeth Robinson.

1272
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:09,713
It's my real name.

1273
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,832
Hello, reality.

1274
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,358
My number's on there, too...

1275
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,715
...in case you need me.

1276
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,840
Until we meet again.

1277
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,279
There was a guy hanging around
who wanted to give you this.

1278
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,199
He asked me to make sure you got it.

1279
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,670
Literary agency.

1280
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,800
Right.

1281
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,111
- Say hi to Bob.
- I will do.

1282
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,313
- Good luck.
- Yeah, you too.

1283
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,630
Bye.

1284
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,756
Well, we were thinking a book,
for starters.

1285
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,873
- We'd like to team you with a ghostwriter.
- He'll help you tell your story.

1286
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,039
Sorry, stories.

1287
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,469
We think it would make a great book.

1288
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,679
Or a series of books.

1289
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,194
The important thing is
we need to get hold of you.

1290
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,034
- I don't actually have a phone currently.
- Okay.

1291
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,592
We can sort that.
Should we get one for Bob?

1292
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,558
I think we can share.

1293
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,831
Looks like he wants to write it, though.

1294
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:25,280
What are you...

1295
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,600
I'm clean, Dad.

1296
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,992
- "Clean" as, what, like...?
- Everything.

1297
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,953
I just wanted you to know.

1298
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:38,916
You know, I was...

1299
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:42,154
I was thinking while I was
standing here just now...

1300
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:47,910
...the last time
I wasn't high in front of you...

1301
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,754
...I was 11.

1302
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,472
Before Australia.

1303
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,153
I wanted to apologize.

1304
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,272
For everything.

1305
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,878
I don't blame you for giving up on me.

1306
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,635
No, Dad, I don't want your money.

1307
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,312
I didn't give up on you.

1308
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,832
I was ashamed...

1309
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:32,720
...of myself.

1310
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,432
I was never afraid to fly.

1311
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,116
I just didn't know how to do...

1312
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,996
I didn't know how to be your father.

1313
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:54,759
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

1314
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,190
- No...
- Jack, what are you doing out there?

1315
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,078
I'm talking to my son.

1316
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,795
And my grandson.

1317
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,717
Got him on a lead, don't worry.

1318
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,311
Wait till you see the screensaver.

1319
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,634
Look at that.

1320
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:28,790
Yeah?

1321
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,512
Where'd they go, hey?

1322
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,116
How are you doing
in the deep blue sea there, Bob?

1323
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:43,877
Hey, come on. I've gotta get this bloke
Gary a load of notes.

1324
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,997
Stop fishing.

1325
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,676
Morning, monster.

1326
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,116
Hello, mate.

1327
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:03,840
Caught any fish yet?

1328
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,670
<i>How is a guy, who's spent a third</i>
<i>of his life checked out, to write a book?</i>

1329
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,511
Come on, Bob, help me out here.

1330
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,594
I'm stuck.

1331
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:28,991
Bob. Bob!

1332
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,996
I just loved it.

1333
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,640
- Every word.
- Thank you.

1334
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,314
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Okay.

1335
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,836
James, we're about to start.

1336
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:49,273
Not before you say hi to your biggest fan.

1337
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,435
- Betty.
- I'm so proud of you.

1338
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,594
Hi. Thanks for coming.

1339
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,000
James.

1340
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,680
- James.
- Yeah.

1341
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:05,837
- Bob.
- Okay.

1342
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,753
Off you go.

1343
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,279
Okay, Bob.

1344
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,439
Great, thank you.

1345
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,438
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1346
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:17,598
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1347
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,240
Hey, Bob.

1348
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,479
- Hey, Dad.
- Son.

1349
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,996
- It's all a bit overwhelming.
- Yeah.

1350
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,957
He's got your scarf.

1351
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,152
I told you he wasn't a stray.

1352
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,750
Bob, you good?

1353
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:33,910
Yeah.

1354
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,116
Go on, Bob. High-five.

1355
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,393
Good boy.

1356
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,072
Hi, everyone.

1357
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,080
Didn't expect there to be
so many people here.

1358
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:56,511
I could make some joke about there
not being enough room to swing a cat...

1359
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:59,275
...but I don't think Bob would like that.

1360
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,589
A friend helped me with this.

1361
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,390
And when I was stuck, her advice was...

1362
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,837
...start by mentioning that
everyone gets a second chance.

1363
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:15,116
But that not everyone
manages to take them.

1364
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,600
Luckily for me...

1365
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:22,310
...I had some very important companions...

1366
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,676
...to help with my second chance.

1367
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,829
And then she said...

1368
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,196
...to just tell the truth.

1369
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,317
And that's what I've done.

1370
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,634
- Absolutely loved it, mate. Well done.
- Thank you.

1371
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,434
Little paw print there.

1372
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:52,080
- Thank you so much.
- Here you go.

1373
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:56,834
- You enjoy that?
- Felt like I lived every moment.

1374
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,436
Good.

1375
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,313
- Hi.
- Hi.

1376
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,916
Come on, you guys.

1377
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,354
Keep it going. That's great.

1378
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,874
Now you guys.

1379
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:50,430
<i>Beautiful! That's great. Now, the basses.</i>

1380
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,274
<i>Come on, get low.</i>

1381
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,799
All together!

1382
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,399
That's it, beautiful!

1383
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:16,199
We'll break it down now.

1384
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,071
<i>Yeah! Give yourself a round of applause!</i>

1385
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:40,391
Yes, brother. Yes, mate.

1386
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,671
Nice one, dude. Bob the cat, eh?

1387
01:38:43,305 --> 01:39:43,210

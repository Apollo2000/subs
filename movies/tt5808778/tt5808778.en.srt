<i>Room number?</i>

7
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,750
I don't know.

8
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:36,833
<i>Just a moment...</i>

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,625
<i>She's in Room 237.</i>

10
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,458
And...?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,292
<i>She just gave birth.</i>

12
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,583
<i>Hello, are you still there?</i>

13
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:54,375
<i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

14
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,125
Is she alright?

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,750
<i>Absolutely fine.</i>

16
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,542
And the baby?

17
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:02,667
<i>As well.</i>

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,917
Thank you.

19
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:11,375
Are you done?

CHILDREN

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,292
- Don't you like any of them?
- It's not that...

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,458
We've got all kinds of people.

23

DEFORMED

24
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,792
Right, that's enough.

25
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:57,375
What are you after, boys or girls?

26
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,208
You can speak freely here.

27
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:03,958
I don't care about the gender.

28
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,750
Then you have all you need right here.

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,833
I think I'm going to go.

30
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:13,708
It's natural for this to happen
to you the first time.

31
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,417
It happens to lots of you.

32
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,208
But what can you do?

33
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,000
You can't control your instincts.

34
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,042
What's happening to you now
will go on all your life.

35
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,292
I have to go, my wife just gave birth.

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,292
And the right thing to do now
is to see your baby?

37
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,333
I don't know what to do.

38
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:37,958
I don't want to hurt anyone.

39
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't want to hurt my child.

40
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:48,917
Did you know the Egyptian civilization
lasted 3,000 years,

41
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:52,333
and in those 3,000 years
many generations were born

42
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:56,542
and died as slaves,
never knowing another life?

43
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't know what you mean.

44
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:04,875
What I mean is that some people
are born to suffer

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,917
and if they're made to suffer,
it doesn't matter

46
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:09,875
because it's what they were born for.

47
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,458
That's horrible.

48
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,083
The world is horrible,

49
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,750
the human being is horrible,

50
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,417
but we can't run away from it

51
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,208
because we are the horror.

52
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,125
You have to accept it.

53
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,833
We do social work.

54
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,875
You don't want to hurt
anyone you love, like your baby.

55
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,875
Do it here, no one suffers here.

56
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,750
You can meet her tomorrow.

57
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,500
- How old is she?
- 11.

58
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,292
Don't be stupid, don't do it outside.

59
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,208
She won't suffer.

60
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:15,625
Come here tomorrow.

61
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:10,583
<i>Maybe I couldn't talk to you
when I saw you.</i>

62
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:16,292
<i>There's something in your look
that I never saw.</i>

63
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:22,667
<i>Pitiless silence instead of love,</i>

64
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:29,167
<i>and when I sought to speak,
someone sang.</i>

65
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:36,792
<i>Dancing together, all around.</i>

66
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:43,333
<i>As I was watching, facing you both,</i>

67
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,750
<i>I felt that someone spoke,</i>

68
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,458
<i>and it was your voice.</i>

69
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:57,292
<i>When he caressed you, someone sang.</i>

70
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,042
<i>And in the darkness,
suddenly I understood</i>

71
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:11,375
<i>that it was my pride that hurt you.</i>

72
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:16,958
<i>Unwillingly, I myself guided you</i>

73
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,167
<i>by her side,</i>

74
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:27,042
<i>as had happened before.</i>

75
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:55,333
<i>When I lost your love, someone sang.</i>

SKINS

77
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,375
In the world there are people
it's better not to see.

78
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,083
You deserve the prettiest eyes
in the world.

Honey!

81
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:40,958
I'm off to work! On the subway today!
I'll be back later.

82
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:41,917
Okay!

83
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,292
Are you going to eat?

84
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,292
Yes.

85
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,167
WE HAVE ELIMINATED YOUR PUBLICATION.

86
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,833
IT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH E.U. NORMS.

87
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,750
Do you know what you want?

88
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,958
- Have you got chicken soup?
- Yes, but it's not on the menu.

89
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,375
It's alright, never mind.

90
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,375
The bill!

91
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,042
- That's her, right?
- Yeah.

92
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,458
What's up, cutie?
What are you doing?

93
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,875
But don't go yet, cutie.

94
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,750
One question.

95
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,708
If you've got an ass on your face,
have you got a mouth on your ass?

96
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,292
Go on, give her a kiss.

97
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,583
Fuck, look at all this shit.
You put this up your asshole.

98
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,167
- Where you going?
- Come here.

99
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,500
- Got your phone?
- Yeah, sure.

100
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:52,750
Film this.

101
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Fuck!

102
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:58,875
Get her!

103
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,292
Come with us!

104
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,917
Don't go, bitch!

105
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,792
She's ready.

106
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,208
Are you sure you want the same one
as usual? We've got new people.

107
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,125
- Yes. I want Laura.
- You have to pay in advance.

108
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,375
I've only got this.

109
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,000
55?

110
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,083
Yes.

111
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,667
She doesn't know
I've been here before, does she?

112
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,542
- Unless you've told her, no.
- No, I never speak.

113
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,500
Then no.

114
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,583
I'll tell you when to go in.

115
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,500
Alright.

116
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,500
And stop treating me
like a little girl. I'm 29.

117
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,583
I'm sick of it.

118
00:14:55,917 --> 00:15:00,208
<i>Laura, he has your diamonds!</i>

119
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,667
<i>Laura!</i>

120
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:16,750
Where are they?

121
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,583
Here they are, Laura.

122
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,667
My diamonds!

123
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,000
They're not here.

124
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,292
Why did I get handed this life?

125
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,125
I can't take it anymore.

126
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,500
I can't take it anymore.

127
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,125
Mama. Mama.

128
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,292
Mama, please.

129
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:52,125
- Calm down.
- Why me?

130
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,042
Why me?

131
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,417
My life was fine.

132
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,625
I can't take it anymore.

133
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,542
Mama.

134
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,583
This is my girlfriend.

135
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,500
My girlfriend.

136
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,125
Get out of my life, dear.

137
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,042
Get out and don't come back.

138
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,583
I love you.

139
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,208
Go.

140
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,250
<i>Black your hair</i>

141
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,917
<i>it covered your body.</i>

142
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,333
<i>So full of love</i>

143
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,250
<i>I saw you dancing.</i>

144
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,583
<i>Another man embraced you,</i>

145
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,375
<i>another man kissed you,</i>

146
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,833
<i>but it was me</i>

147
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,667
<i>you were looking at.</i>

148
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,833
<i>Face of a Gypsy,</i>

149
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,333
<i>sweet, passionate,</i>

150
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,583
<i>you gave me your love</i>

151
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,417
<i>with a sword.</i>

152
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,000
<i>Today along the ways</i>

153
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,458
<i>you wander to your destination,</i>

154
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,000
<i>you live love,</i>

155
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,625
<i>you steal affection.</i>

156
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:20,042
<i>Where are your eyes so deep?</i>

157
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:24,542
<i>And the fire of your lips
that were mine?</i>

158
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:29,958
<i>The spirits I drink open my wounds,</i>

159
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:34,542
<i>I get drunk and love you even more.</i>

160
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,708
Well, I'll call later.

161
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,458
- Vanesa.
- Yes?

162
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,583
It's important to be more relaxed.

163
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,542
You're very nervous
and that's not good for you or the baby.

164
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,292
In vitro pregnancies are very delicate,

165
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,583
and more in your case
because of the achondroplasia.

166
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,958
And when will I find out
if my child has achondroplasia?

167
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,333
- We'll know in a few days.
- Okay.

168
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:59,500
Now get some rest.
And a vacation would be even better.

169
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,792
That's not going to be possible.

170
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:02,958
What do you do?

171
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,208
I...

172
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,792
Okay, we've got it!
Break for a sandwich!

173
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,625
Nobody step on the cyclorama.

174
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,792
You have 15 minutes.

175
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:40,833
Come on, hurry up!

176
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,167
Honestly, I don't get it.

177
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,417
Claudia, I know it's hard,
but you have to make an effort.

178
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,792
I am making an effort.

179
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,208
I'm here because
Social Services told me to.

180
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,500
He acts like the victim.
I'm the victim here.

181
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,375
I know you feel bad too,

182
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:27,542
but if you want to help him,
try to take a back seat.

183
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,583
I've always been in the back seat.

184
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,500
Maybe we should talk to his father too.
It may be the only way to help your son.

185
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,333
If you can find him...

186
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,583
Well... What the hell's wrong
with him this time?

187
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:53,167
Your son has Body Integrity
Identity Disorder.

188
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,458
What the fuck is that?

189
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,667
Your son doesn't recognize
his legs for what they are.

190
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,458
- Is he crazy?
- No, he's not, he needs help.

191
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,125
- Why has he got it?
- People with BIID...

192
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:03,500
- What's that?
- The same thing.

193
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:05,458
- Can I smoke?
- No.

194
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,417
Sorry.

195
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:10,083
I was saying that BIID patients
have a schizoid behavior

196
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,958
- and it may be for two reasons.
- What reasons?

197
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,083
They see an amputee
and take them as a role model...

198
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,083
What the f...?

199
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:20,208
...or they don't feel loved
and think that as an amputee

200
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,958
they can get the affection
that they need.

201
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,417
- He's dyed his hair now.
- What's that got to do with it?

202
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,542
Nothing, but he does weird things.

203
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:30,708
Can you ask him to come in?

204
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,500
Come in.

205
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:49,000
Will you get out of the chair, moron?
You're not a paralytic.

206
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,167
Get up.

207
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,167
Get up.

208
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,833
Get up!

209
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,125
Leave him be. If he doesn't
want to get up, it's alright.

210
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,708
But he walks fine!

211
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,708
We're going to respect him, alright?

212
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,542
Hello, Cristian, how are you?

213
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:09,458
You don't want to talk?

214
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,833
That's fine.

215
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:15,125
Claudia, what do you think
is wrong with your son?

216
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,083
My tummy aches.

217
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,542
What?

218
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,458
What do you think is wrong
with your son?

219
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,208
He's a moron who doesn't
appreciate what I do for him.

220
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,583
Tell me about his problem.

221
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:28,292
Right...
He says he doesn't want to have legs.

222
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,125
- It's not that.
- Gee, you're talking now?

223
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:31,958
Then what is it?

224
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,583
These legs aren't mine.

225
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:37,625
What do you mean?
Do you want other legs?

226
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,167
No, I don't want others.

227
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,875
I don't want have legs or walk.
I want to get rid of them.

228
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,500
But that's not possible.
Your legs are healthy.

229
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,125
But they're not mine.

230
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,792
It's my body, isn't it?

231
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:51,458
Are you happy?

232
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,625
Cristian, are you happy?

233
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,333
Do you think you'll be happy
without legs?

234
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,208
Yes.

235
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,042
- This kid freaks me out.
- And why do you think that?

236
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,583
Mermaids don't have legs
and they're happy.

237
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,625
- How do you get on with your mother?
- He hates me.

238
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:16,875
She hates me.

239
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:20,625
- She hates everyone. She hates you too.
- What are you on about, kid?

240
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,875
- Do you want to see your father?
- Of course not.

241
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,250
Don't ask him those questions.

242
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,625
- Do you want to see your father?
- Yes.

243
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,083
Leave my husband out of it!

244
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,917
You want to see your father?
Why do you want to see your father?

245
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:34,708
Leave your father out if it!

246
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:38,875
He's a good person!
Not like you, you're bad!

247
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:41,792
- And you're crazy!
- You're the crazy one! Nobody loves you!

248
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,917
I'm crazy? You're crazy!

249
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,375
Stop right now or I'll call the police!

250
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,500
Who are you going to call, bitch?

251
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,333
Your son's bleeding.

252
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:09,708
What have you done, you retard?

253
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:38,458
Where have you been, Samantha?

254
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:41,833
Samantha!

255
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,792
Samantha! I was worried sick.

256
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:48,958
How could you do this to me?
I'm going to come down with something.

257
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,167
You're crying. Did something happen
to you? Did someone see you?

258
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,125
- Answer me!
- No.

259
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:59,000
You didn't go out like that,
with your face uncovered?

260
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:01,458
- Yes.
- And you think that's okay?

261
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,667
- What do you want me to do?
- Cover yourself up!

262
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,417
Don't you see that something
could happen to you? People are evil!

263
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,667
I don't want to happen to you
what happened to your mother.

264
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,667
If she'd listened to me,
the three of us would be here now.

265
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:18,000
We all have our lot.
You think I don't have to be careful?

266
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:19,958
I'm not like you.

267
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,417
"Due to the 3200 euro debt,

268
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:36,708
we shall proceed to the seizure
of the premises of NO. 6 Cruz St.,

269
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:40,958
unless a bank transfer
for the above amount is sent within...

270
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:42,917
3 working days."

271
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,500
Come in, don't be afraid.

272
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:16,208
Finished already?

273
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,042
We're on a break.

274
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,417
Go, go, go.

275
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:24,958
Yesterday we got 20.7 market share.

276
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,000
Mothers in this country love Pinkoo.

277
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:27,917
I'm glad.

278
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,208
What's wrong?

279
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:34,250
Alexis, I'm so tired, I need a vacation.

280
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,875
Don't talk crap, Vanesa,
we need the money.

281
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,250
- I don't.
- Well I do!

282
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:40,625
Besides, there's a contract, remember?

283
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,792
Of course.

284
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:46,333
- Vanesa...
- What?

285
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Have you grown?

286
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,583
- What?
- Have you grown?

287
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,458
Your costume doesn't close right.

288
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,958
I don't know. You look bigger.

289
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,458
It's the same one as always.

290
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,333
No, no, no...

291
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,708
You're the same height.

292
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:06,083
Don't worry.

293
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:08,167
I'm not worried.

294
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:10,542
Have you seen this?

295
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:15,792
A viewer tweeted with a video
to say thank you.

296
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:18,958
<i>Hello, Pink Bear!
I'm Sofía and my son is Alberto.</i>

297
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,292
<i>We want to thank you</i>

298
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,042
<i>because Alberto and I have
so much fun watching your show.</i>

299
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:26,542
<i>As his mother, it makes me happy
to see him happy.</i>

300
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:30,333
<i>Pinkoo the Pink Bear can never end!
At least until Alberto grows up!</i>

301
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:32,000
<i>Thank you! 'Bye!</i>

302
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,542
Vanesa, are you crying?

303
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,833
Alexis, I wanted to talk to you.

304
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,000
We're all set.

305
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,583
Hi, how are you?

306
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,917
Let's go.

307
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:50,875
Come on.

308
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:56,958
Come on, let's go.

309
00:29:58,458 --> 00:29:59,250
Vanesa.

310
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:03,542
You make people happy
and that's beautiful.

311
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,583
I don't, the pink bear does.

312
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:08,458
Come on, let's go.

313
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:39,500
You still haven't dumped that moron?

314
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,583
I told you, I'm going to tell him
at dinner tonight.

315
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,542
Why don't you call him
and tell him straight out?

316
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,833
I'm not going to split up
with him over the phone.

317
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,583
You have to do things right.

318
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:51,417
Guille.

319
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:53,458
Guille.

320
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,667
I don't love him, I love you.

321
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,917
Don't you see
that we're made for each other?

322
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,083
You don't want me to touch you?

323
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,542
No.

324
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:12,833
You're a woman?

325
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:15,292
- Is it true what they told me?
- What did they tell you?

326
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,292
- You can't see.
- No, I can't see.

327
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:23,000
You don't see anything?
No shadows...?

328
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,625
I can't see anything at all.
No shadows, nothing.

329
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:29,417
Then can you take off
what you have on your eyes?

330
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:30,542
No.

331
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,625
I never take them off when I work.
They're diamonds.

332
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,375
How do I know you're not watching me?

333
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,042
That those are contacts
and you're watching me?

334
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:41,875
I paid more to be with you
because you can't see me.

335
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,125
I don't think you paid much.

336
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:45,542
I've got almost no clients.

337
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:47,792
I can't take the diamonds off.

338
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:48,750
Then I'm leaving.

339
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,583
Wait!

340
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,500
I don't want to have problems.

341
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:16,375
Are you okay?

342
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:19,167
It's the first time I've done
anything without my diamonds.

343
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,917
Just because I can't refuse the money...

344
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,250
So what do you want to do?

345
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:26,542
Just touch you.
I don't want you touching me.

346
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,292
Why did you change places?

347
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,958
I'm left-handed.

348
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:53,833
- It's funny...
- What?

349
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:57,292
You and the people who fuck me
don't want me to touch you.

350
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,583
Is as if you were all hiding something.

351
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,542
- I don't want to talk.
- Okay. Sorry.

352
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:11,208
Hey... I can sense
that you're uncomfortable.

353
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:15,042
If you're not happy and want to go,
it's fine. You'll get your money back.

354
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,292
- Will you please shut up?
- Sorry.

355
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,792
Can I ask you a favor?

356
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,042
- A favor?
- Let me touch you.

357
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:45,625
Laura...

358
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:49,208
Sorry, I thought you'd finished.

359
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,375
Are you alright?

360
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,458
Alexis, my friend! How are you?

361
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,250
Great, sir.

362
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,250
You don't look so good.
Are you alright?

363
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:28,167
Fine.

364
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,875
- And Vanesa?
- Fine too. Why?

365
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,667
She looks tired to me. Do you know
if there's anything wrong?

366
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,333
First I've heard of it.

367
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,917
You do know that
a ton of dwarves could do this?

368
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:40,833
- Sure, but...
- No...

369
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,542
I wouldn't want you and Vanesa
to stop working for us.

370
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,375
But I don't want the ratings to fall.

371
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,875
- We got back up yesterday.
- That's no use to me.

372
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:52,208
Don't talk in the first person
about my show.

373
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:55,875
I was thinking we might give her
something to motivate her.

374
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:59,042
We could get paid in advance
for the last three episodes.

375
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:00,500
Money always motivates.

376
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:01,958
The problem isn't money.

377
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,625
Vanesa is fucking sick of all of us.

378
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,083
You're the one who wants the money.

379
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:12,667
Tomorrow you get the cash
for those three episode in advance,

380
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,375
but get Vanesa
to dance in front of the camera again

381
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,708
as if she'd swallowed
three bags of speed

382
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:21,250
or you'll never set foot
in these fucking studios again.

383
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,250
Idiot!

384
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,333
<i>- Can I speak to Vanesa Redondo?</i>
- Speaking.

385
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,250
<i>Vanesa, it's Dr. Mato.</i>

386
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,958
<i>We've been studying
your ultrasound and...</i>

387
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:35,625
<i>I'm sorry to tell you,
your son has achondroplasia too.</i>

388
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:39,625
<i>You should know that the fetus
has no problem apart from that.</i>

389
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,083
<i>He'll just have the same disease.</i>

390
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,042
<i>It was something we knew could happen.</i>

391
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:50,667
My eyes!

392
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,208
My eyes!

393
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:56,250
My diamonds!

394
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,625
What's wrong, Laura?

395
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:01,542
Mikel, my diamonds, I can't find them.

396
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,458
Stop screaming, she'll hear you.

397
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:04,667
Help me find them.

398
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,667
What's with the yelling?

399
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:07,792
You've got a client.

400
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,500
I can't, I've lost my eyes.

401
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,958
Honey, I'm doing to do some errands.

402
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:20,917
Honey?

403
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:40,292
<i>Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you,</i>

404
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,958
<i>happy birthday, dear Samantha,</i>

405
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:46,417
<i>happy birthday to you!</i>

406
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,083
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

407
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,667
Go on.

408
00:36:58,875 --> 00:36:59,875
Great!

409
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:03,875
It's okay...
Now, let's eat.

410
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,500
That's it.

411
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:09,667
Here.

412
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:15,875
What's wrong?
Aren't you hungry?

413
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:21,500
<i>Cristian, the 17-year-old
who was run over a few days ago</i>

414
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:24,333
<i>in the Lucero area, has just died.</i>

415
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:27,250
<i>His legs were completely

416
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:31,167
<i>and although at first
the bleeding was controlled,</i>

417
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,625
<i>infection set in and it ended his life.</i>

418
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,958
- Don't change it. Turn it up!
<i>- Nothing is yet known</i>

419
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,875
<i>of the hit-and-run driver.</i>

420
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,875
That's terrible. How can there be
people like that in the world?

421
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,000
Honey...

422
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:47,292
One second.

423
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,125
What are you doing?

424
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:11,208
Why are you touching my mother's photo?

425
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,500
No, I wasn't touching
your mother's photo.

426
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,333
I was looking at you, you're beautiful.

427
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,167
Sure.

428
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,083
Your mother looked like a good woman.

429
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,917
- How long ago did she die?
- 6 months.

430
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,250
And the decoration...

431
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:25,583
- You're not going to change it?
- Of course not.

432
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,333
- Shall we eat?
- Yes.

433
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,625
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

434
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,667
Stop it!

435
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,458
I can't help it.

436
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,375
- Well, shall we eat?
- Yes.

437
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:51,125
Aren't you going to wash your hands?

438
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,083
Never mind.

439
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:59,333
Sorry.

440
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:04,333
You're acting strange.

441
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:08,917
And that bag...
Is something wrong?

442
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:10,958
No. Do you feel strange?

443
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:16,000
Well...

444
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,792
Something's wrong, isn't it?

445
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,333
No, no, no.
Well, yes, but it's not serious.

446
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,417
Tell me.

447
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,208
I was talking to my mother yesterday.

448
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:24,625
I told her I've got a girlfriend.

449
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:26,292
- Really?
- Yes.

450
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:27,458
And what did she say?

451
00:40:27,542 --> 00:40:28,625
Not much.

452
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:30,042
Right...

453
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:32,833
The bad part came later.

454
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:35,583
Later, when?

455
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,708
Alright...

456
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,208
My mother always imagined
how I liked my women.

457
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:40,583
How did you like your women?

458
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:42,875
I'd never spoken to my mother about it.

459
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:45,792
About what?
That you have a girlfriend?

460
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,458
No, that I like girls like you.

461
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,125
What do you mean "like me"?

462
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:52,375
Yes, like you.

463
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,167
What am I like?

464
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:56,500
Well...

465
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,292
I don't get you.

466
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,458
I'd never told my mother

467
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,958
that I don't like normal girls.

468
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,125
I'm a normal girl.

469
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,292
Well, even though she had an idea,

470
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:14,458
she was never
as sure as she was yesterday.

471
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,333
- Yesterday?
- When I called you.

472
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,625
My mother saw your photo
and got kind of upset...

473
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:23,333
I don't know
if I'm explaining this right.

474
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:28,000
I think I'm getting very pissed off.

475
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,792
Why? Because of my mother?

476
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:32,708
No, it's not that.

477
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,042
Why, honey?

478
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:39,542
Ana, you know I like my women to be...

479
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,125
Deformed, like me?

480
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,125
Yes. That's why I've never had
a girlfriend before.

481
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:47,417
Because I'd never found a girl like you.

482
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,417
I'm more than just deformed.

483
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,292
You hit me?

484
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:55,917
Yes. Did you hear me?

485
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:58,833
I'm not sure, I think my hearing's gone.

486
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:02,667
I'm telling you,
I'm more than just deformed.

487
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,083
Ana, I know.

488
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,292
I'm in love with<i> you.</i>

489
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:09,042
Crazy in love.

490
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,250
Are you in love with me
or the way I look?

491
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:12,500
Ana, I like you.

492
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:15,583
But me or the way I look?

493
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,250
I like<i> you.</i>

494
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,333
You know what I think, Ernesto?

495
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,750
I don't think you're in love with me.

496
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,167
You've never had a partner in your life

497
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,583
because you haven't bothered
to know women, to understand them.

498
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:42,208
Deep down you don't care
if I'm a total bitch

499
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:44,583
or a wonderful person.

500
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:50,875
Because you're only interested
in the way I look.

501
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,833
And that's a sickness.

502
00:42:56,667 --> 00:43:01,917
Skins change, they're operated on
or they transform.

503
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,000
Physical appearance is nothing.

504
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:09,958
Ana,

505
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,792
I'm in love with you,

506
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,500
crazy in love.

507
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:18,292
I'm not, Ernesto.

508
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,292
Who's Guillermo?

509
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:50,667
Look, I arranged this dinner
on purpose to tell you.

510
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,625
I was the one who asked you.

511
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:55,250
Right, but... No.

512
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:58,667
I don't want to continue this.

513
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:02,708
Who's Guillermo?

514
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:06,583
Ernesto, we haven't been together
for long and it's not working out.

515
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,375
I met someone else,

516
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:09,500
I'm very excited.

517
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,208
I'm sorry.

518
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:12,750
- Ana...
- Yes?

519
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:15,833
My clothes are in that bag.

520
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:17,208
My mother...

521
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:19,583
She told me yesterday to get out
and never come back.

522
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,958
I've spent two days walking the streets,

523
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:24,083
with no money and nowhere to go.

524
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:26,625
I was thinking of staying here,
with you...

525
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,375
I have to go now?

526
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:51,125
Well, you can finish dinner.

527
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,500
Sorry, I have to get that
or he won't stop.

528
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:59,750
- And I don't want him to worry.
- Yes...

529
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:01,625
Guille.

530
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,375
I can't talk now,
I'll call you in a while.

531
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:08,333
Yes, me too.
I'll call you later. Okay...

532
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,292
I think I'd better go.

533
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:16,083
Well, yes...
The energy's getting kind of...

534
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:20,250
Do you mind if I take the money?

535
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:23,208
In case I can't fix things
with my mother or...

536
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:25,583
Please, why would I mind?
It's only 30 euros.

537
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,375
I didn't have time
to go to the cash machine.

538
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:53,208
The news got to you, huh?

539
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,583
People like that
shouldn't be in this world.

540
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:02,417
So when you're on the street,
be careful and protect yourself.

541
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:05,917
Well, now it's present time.

542
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,208
Here it is.

543
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:23,042
Go on, open it.

544
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,875
What's wrong?
What are you waiting for?

545
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,958
A unicorn mask, for when
you're out on the street. Like it?

546
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:51,708
Come on, I'll help you put it on.

547
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,750
That's it.

548
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,167
Wow! It's beautiful.

549
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:13,833
It cost me a fortune.

550
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:16,125
Don't move, I'm going to make a picture.

551
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,958
That's it.

552
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,958
It looks great on you.
It's so much fun!

553
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:22,792
I'll send you the photo.

554
00:47:24,917 --> 00:47:28,083
Gee, my battery's run out.
I'll be right back.

555
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:10,750
How did you find out?

556
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:12,417
The press.

557
00:48:12,583 --> 00:48:14,083
Did you know what his face looked like?

558
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,083
It was Cristian's chair.

559
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:25,083
You can't imagine
what I went through with him.

560
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:31,208
And now you turn up.

561
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:44,792
I smoke dope.

562
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:46,333
Got a light?

563
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,917
Yes.

564
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:58,667
Claudia, my life hasn't been any better.

565
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,667
I left so I wouldn't harm you.

566
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:05,167
Leaving was the worst harm
you could've done me.

567
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:09,000
You were with another woman?

568
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,458
Tell me.

569
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,667
- I'm over it.
- It's not that.

570
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:19,958
I would've forgiven anything.

571
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:52,292
He was making a mermaid's tail.

572
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:54,792
Look, it's well done.

573
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:58,458
Perfect seams, everything perfect.

574
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:00,250
He was good at sewing.

575
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,583
He said he wanted to be
like the mermaids...

576
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:47,583
I know.

577
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:51,958
How do you know?

578
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,167
I followed Cristian on Facebook.

579
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:58,125
I'm on Facebook too.
Haven't you seen me?

580
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:00,292
Er... no.

581
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:05,250
- Why did he want to be a mermaid?
- Because he was a son of a bitch.

582
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:08,333
- Claudia...
- You didn't worry about me!

583
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,458
You were my husband.

584
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,625
It wasn't you...
it was because of Cristian.

585
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:15,000
What's he got to do with it?

586
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:18,625
If you'd asked me,
I would've had an abortion.

587
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:20,417
Why did you leave?

588
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:22,042
I'm begging you.

589
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:25,000
Tell me, tell me.
Please, I need to understand...

590
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,250
Tell me, if you ever loved me, tell me.

591
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:28,667
Tell me. Tell me.

592
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,583
- Claudia...
- Tell me.

593
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:31,458
Claudia...

594
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:37,125
When you said we were having
a baby, it all changed for me.

595
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:41,417
I couldn't control
what was happening to me.

596
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:43,708
I didn't leave because of you,

597
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,708
I left so I wouldn't harm our son.

598
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,417
I'm sick, Claudia.

599
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:54,625
Sick.

600
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:04,458
I'm spinning out.

601
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:06,292
From whom?

602
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:07,792
Nobody.

603
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,917
I'm spinning out from the joint.

604
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:11,917
Okay.

605
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:14,500
I'll get you off the floor.

606
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:18,250
Rest for a while.

607
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:29,708
Yes?

608
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:34,833
Are you cured?

609
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:38,875
If I were cured,
I would've come back before.

610
00:52:44,542 --> 00:52:45,417
You have to go in now.

611
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:48,458
I can't, really, I can't.

612
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,000
They're my eyes!

613
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,000
Do what you like,
but if that man leaves, so do you.

614
00:52:53,792 --> 00:52:56,792
I can't imagine you living
on the street all alone.

615
00:52:56,917 --> 00:53:00,833
Laura, don't do anything crazy,
you can't live alone on the street.

616
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:03,792
You, shut up!
You're giving me a pain in the pussy!

617
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:06,833
The man's real mad.
What do I tell him?

618
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,125
You decide, Laura.

619
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:53,833
You're gonna freak.

620
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,958
What's up, buttface?
Aren't you gonna kick me?

621
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:02,125
No, now we're gonna give it to you.

622
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,125
Vanesa!

623
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:46,000
Vanesa hasn't come to work today.

624
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:48,417
She called.

625
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,958
She says she can't come in
because she's sick.

626
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:54,875
She also says she wants to talk to you.

627
00:55:56,917 --> 00:55:58,958
Here's the money you asked for.

628
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,375
This is your last chance.

629
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,958
Go to her house with the money
and bring her here.

630
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:10,125
I don't care if she dies after shooting,
but bring her.

631
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:13,625
We have a contract
and you'd better not break it.

632
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,833
Ana, you've got a call!

633
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,500
I'm coming!

634
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,000
Oh, we're eating off the coffee table?

635
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,208
Then take away those shells.

636
00:56:58,583 --> 00:56:59,583
Who called?

637
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:00,333
I don't know.

638
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:04,125
Open up!

639
00:57:08,042 --> 00:57:09,542
Open up, damn it!

640
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,417
What's this shit you're pulling?

641
00:57:19,917 --> 00:57:20,625
What's wrong?

642
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:22,000
Guille, what's wrong?

643
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:23,667
Are you going to see who called?

644
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:31,292
Guille, cut it out.
You know Ernesto called me.

645
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,500
- Why is this guy calling you?
- Because he's nuts!

646
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:34,708
I left him.

647
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:36,542
I don't care if he's gone in the head,

648
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:38,042
if he calls
it's because you're leading him on!

649
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,417
Guille, stop it.

650
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:40,625
Yes, I will stop it!

651
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:42,833
You can both go fuck yourselves!

652
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:45,875
And I'm not eating this shitty food!
It's crap!

653
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:49,250
What's with the briefcase?

654
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:52,083
The last three episodes, in cash.

655
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:53,875
I don't need that money.

656
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:58,375
Well I do, Vanesa, I do!
That's why I asked for it!

657
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:00,250
Calm down, Alexis.

658
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,750
He gave it to me to give to you
and get you to work.

659
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,292
I'm not going to work.

660
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:07,333
I'm leaving television.

661
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,792
Look, Alexis,

662
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:16,583
I've always wanted to have a child.

663
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:19,292
What are you saying?

664
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:23,667
A few months ago...
I had an<i> in vitro</i>

665
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:26,792
and I'm pregnant.

666
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:29,500
It's a high-risk pregnancy

667
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:35,500
because my child
has achondroplasia, like me...

668
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:38,167
and I want it to be alright

669
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,458
because I'm alone.

670
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:44,917
How far along are you?

671
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:46,042
Three months.

672
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:49,125
It's early.
We can still get an abortion.

673
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,208
Shit, I'm out of data.

674
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:53,250
Then use the WiFi.

675
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:55,208
You don't care about the data, right?

676
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:58,833
Forget it, I'm out.

677
00:58:59,042 --> 00:59:01,458
Your only talent is being a dwarf,
don't you see?

678
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,708
What'll you live on after two years?

679
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:05,292
What? You can't do anything.

680
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,833
If not for me,
you'd be where I found you,

681
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:08,750
on the Plaza Mayor playing Mickey Mouse!

682
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:11,458
Don't you see how much money
I'll lose if you quit this?

683
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:13,667
Don't you see how selfish you are?

684
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:16,792
Listen, you bitch,

685
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:19,833
you're not having that kid
and you're not quitting.

686
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:22,042
If you even think
of breaking the contract...

687
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,083
- Where are you going?
- To my house.

688
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:27,375
Stay back or I'll throw
this money out of the window!

689
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:28,375
You're crazy...

690
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:29,958
- Give me the money!
- No!

691
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,375
Was there a lot of blood?

692
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:44,375
Ana, for God's sake...

693
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:46,833
I heard the neighbors scream out

694
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:49,333
that he was deformed,

695
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:52,292
that his head was shoved inside.

696
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,292
Ana, stop.

697
01:00:53,458 --> 01:00:56,167
You've been talking about this all day.
Stop talking about it.

698
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,042
You saw a dead person...
A lot of blood...

699
01:00:59,667 --> 01:01:00,875
It was horrible...

700
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,750
Sure.

701
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:06,292
Shouldn't you give it back?

702
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:07,333
The money? Why?

703
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,750
I don't know...

704
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,250
Poor man.

705
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,875
After what happened to him,
and he's got no money...

706
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,875
- Ana, he's dead.
- Sure, sure.

707
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:17,625
Hey, I'm not giving it back.

708
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:18,750
Shit, Guille...

709
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,167
Would you give it back?

710
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,750
I don't know... I think so.

711
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:22,667
I don't know.

712
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:25,583
What I am sure of
is that I need it more.

713
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:30,125
Shit, what a stressful day.

714
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:39,833
What I don't get is, why do
you need so much money?

715
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:41,833
To do what I've always wanted to do.

716
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:42,958
What?

717
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:46,208
- The operation.
- What operation?

718
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:49,750
The reconstruction.

719
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:51,708
What?

720
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,542
I've tried to save up the money
for a facial reconstruction,

721
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:58,000
but it's really expensive.

722
01:01:58,208 --> 01:01:59,625
You want to change your face?

723
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:01,333
No, not change my face.

724
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,542
I want to fix some things.

725
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,000
Are you talking about plastic surgery?

726
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:07,875
Yes.

727
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,417
Aren't you scared of the blood,
the operation and everything?

728
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:12,667
No.

729
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:31,083
I'd like to have fleshy lips
and bushy hair all over,

730
01:02:31,542 --> 01:02:33,167
not gaps in my hair.

731
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,333
Cheekbones,

732
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:38,625
I'd get rid of the scars, the burns,

733
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:42,917
get smooth, normal skin...

734
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:47,875
My hair used to be curly,

735
01:02:48,792 --> 01:02:52,042
but I found out they can apply implants,
anything you want.

736
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,167
I'd get straight hair.

737
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,125
Wouldn't you like a guy like that?

738
01:03:11,042 --> 01:03:12,583
Everyone would.

739
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:15,875
I like you.

740
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,875
We're made for each other.

741
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,625
I know.

742
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,250
Ana, are you alright?

743
01:03:26,542 --> 01:03:27,625
Yes.

744
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,000
Turn off the light.

745
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:38,167
<i>The cellphone you are calling
is turned off or out of range.</i>

746
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:40,958
<i>Please leave your message
after the beep.</i>

747
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:22,167
Don't hurt me, please...

748
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:26,875
Hello?

749
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:27,583
Yes?

750
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:33,500
Hello.

751
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:37,833
- I'm the girl from the other day.
- Nobody told me I had a client.

752
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:39,417
I didn't tell anyone.

753
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:42,000
I came to give you this.

754
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:44,208
They're my diamonds.

755
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:46,042
I knew you've taken them.

756
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:48,000
- You can see?
- No,

757
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:49,833
but I perceive other things.

758
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:54,000
I'm going. I'll leave them here.

759
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,625
Take the diamonds.

760
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:58,833
- What?
- I don't need them anymore.

761
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:01,000
- You need them more.
- No, no...

762
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:02,958
How many times have you been with me?

763
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,708
Once, the other day.

764
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:07,958
Don't lie,
I know that you have come many times.

765
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,875
But your skin is different.

766
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,417
- I know you're not a thief. Take them.
- I can't accept them.

767
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:19,958
Alright.

768
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:22,458
If you won't take a gift,

769
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,833
you'll have to give me
something in exchange.

770
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:28,792
What can I give you?

771
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:47,583
Let's make a deal.

772
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:50,292
You keep the diamonds
and I get to know you.

773
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:53,917
- What?
- I'm dying to touch someone.

774
01:06:54,417 --> 01:06:55,667
To touch you.

775
01:06:55,917 --> 01:06:58,292
- I...
- You need that money.

776
01:06:59,792 --> 01:07:01,375
What do you want to do?

777
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,375
Why do you never want to be touched?

778
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:18,167
People don't like to touch
people like me.

779
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:21,000
I do. You're soft.

780
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,417
I've been touched a lot, all of my life.

781
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:27,792
But they touch me, then go.

782
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:35,667
Don't cover yourself up,
I can't see you.

783
01:07:48,792 --> 01:07:50,625
They're big.

784
01:07:51,542 --> 01:07:52,958
Have you never had a partner?

785
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,625
No, I've only been with people I paid.

786
01:07:59,000 --> 01:07:59,833
Well,

787
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:02,417
I've actually only been with you.

788
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:04,625
I spent all my money here.

789
01:08:11,292 --> 01:08:12,125
Here.

790
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:14,667
You'd better keep them.

791
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:17,167
No, no. I'm paying you.

792
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:20,667
Believe it or not, it was good
that you stole them from me.

793
01:08:21,042 --> 01:08:24,042
Sooner or later
I had to get rid of them.

794
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:28,500
Thanks a lot.

795
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:49,458
<i>The dramatic story of Cristian

796
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:52,833

801

Let's try it.

805
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:25,708
Now that we're alone.

806
01:09:32,542 --> 01:09:33,708
No, Claudia.

808
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:56,250
<i>I usually don't go out in the mornings,</i>

809
01:09:56,542 --> 01:09:58,042
<i>nor in the evenings,</i>

810
01:09:58,208 --> 01:09:59,917
<i>but today I need a little air.</i>

811
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:04,542
<i>I haven't slept all night
and it helped me think...</i>

812
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:09,500
<i>I think you should keep that money.
I only ask you for one thing.</i>

813
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:12,583
<i>Do as you see fit with
the money and be happy,</i>

814
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,667
<i>whatever that is or whatever that means.</i>

815
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:19,792
<i>I've decided that
I'm going to be happy too,</i>

816
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:22,417
<i>but I'm doing it alone.</i>

817
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:26,333
<i>For the first time without my mother
and without a man.</i>

818
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:30,000
<i>Though it may amaze you, Guille,</i>

819
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:33,500
<i>you and I are not made for each other.</i>

820
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:57,250
Is anyone there?

821
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:30,917
- Are you nervous?
- No, I'm fine.

822
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:33,500
Come on, push!

823
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:35,292
It's here! It's here!

824
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:39,292
<i>Maybe I couldn't talk to you
when I should have.</i>

825
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:44,958
<i>There's something in your look
that I never saw.</i>

826
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:50,292
<i>Pitiless silence instead of love,</i>

827
01:11:51,292 --> 01:11:55,792
<i>and when I sought to speak,
someone sang.</i>

828
01:11:56,583 --> 01:12:01,083
<i>Dancing together, all around.</i>

829
01:12:02,083 --> 01:12:06,375
<i>As I was watching, facing you both,</i>

830
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:11,708
<i>I felt that someone spoke,
and it was your voice.</i>

831
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:17,417
<i>When he caressed you, someone sang.</i>

832
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,167
<i>And in the darkness,
suddenly I understood</i>

833
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:48,750
<i>that it was my pride that hurt you.</i>

834
01:12:49,792 --> 01:12:51,542
<i>Unwillingly,</i>

835
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:53,292
WE HAVE CHICKEN SOUP

836
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:57,250
<i>I myself guided you by his side,</i>

837
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:03,833
<i>as had happened before.</i>

838
01:13:05,917 --> 01:13:10,583
<i>Maybe I couldn't talk to you
when I should have.</i>

839
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:15,917
<i>My mind controlled my heart.</i>

840
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:21,250
<i>The price I paid was to see you so,</i>

841
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:26,167
<i>and when he embraced you, someone sang.</i>

842
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:46,667
<i>When I lost your love,</i>

843
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:52,958
<i>someone sang.</i>

844
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:18,708
<i>And in the darkness,
suddenly I understood</i>

845
01:14:19,417 --> 01:14:23,500
<i>that it was my pride that hurt you.</i>

846
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:29,458
<i>Unwillingly, I myself guided you</i>

847
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:32,208
<i>by his side,</i>

848
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:37,500
<i>as had happened before.</i>

849
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:45,208
<i>Maybe I couldn't talk to you

850
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:50,792

<i>The price I paid was to see you so,</i>

852

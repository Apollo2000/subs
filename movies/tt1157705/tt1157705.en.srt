2
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,099
...of "Ben hur,"
you mean?

3
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,366
Granted that it's
too easy and a cliche

4
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,833
to connect your work
with your life

5
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:39,199
in such a direct manner.

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,132
Let me take the example
of "Chinatown."

7
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,632
"Chinatown" is really a movie

8
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,933
about justice not winning.

9
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:47,065
Is that what you
had come to believe?

10
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:48,466
No, not at all.

11
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:51,165
But if you want your film
to serve any purpose,

12
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,966
if you want to show injustice

13
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,766
or corruption of Los
Angeles in that period,

14
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:59,966
you have to show that
injustice somehow won

15
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:03,599
and leave them

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,399
with a feeling of frustration.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,699
I hope you don't mind if
I just reach across here

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,599
and grab a couple of these nuts.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,265
Me too.

20
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:15,065
Anyway, that's... that's fiction.

21
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:18,499
And I think this
probably may be still

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,833
in the land of fiction,
edging toward fact.

23
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:22,699
When they...

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,032
When the newspapers and
the magazines and the books

25
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:28,866
talk about you and little
girls, all right,

26
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,899
is there anything in it?

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,933
Well, I like young women,
let's put it this way.

28
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:36,332
I think most of men do,
actually.

29
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,733
Yeah, but the question turns on how
young, doesn't it?

30
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:41,632
Well, yes.
Here you've come

31
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:45,299
to a concrete case

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,399
for which I have been
behind bars.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,933
That's what you want
to talk about.

34
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:53,933
But what exactly

35
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:56,633
would you like me to tell you?

36
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:12,866
Mr. Polanski!

37
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:15,100
A question here,
Mr. Polanski!

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,666
The Los Angeles
police department

39
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:23,432
today announced the arrest
of Raymond polanski

40
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:25,566
as a result of a complaint

41
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:28,800
filed by the mother
of a 13-year-old female.

42
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,933
It was a year of anxiety,

43
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,833
a year of drama for me,

44
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:37,399
and I thought
that was simply enough.

45
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,799
Enough is enough.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,066
And that was
my decision to leave.

47
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:46,232
You ran away, Roman.

48
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,499
You ran away.

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,833
Well, I, as you say, ran away,

50
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,899
because I think

51
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,733
that I was very unfortunate

52
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:59,466
to have a judge

53
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:02,165
who misused justice.

54
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,499
And he was playing with me

55
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,099
for the period of a year.

56
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,599
I think that I was
some kind of mouse

57
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,432
with which

58
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:19,299
some abominable cat

59
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,299
begins a sport.

60
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,065
Get that out of our face.

61
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:26,332
Please please.

62
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,233
We're trying to get through.

63
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,499
People were not in the habit

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,499
of calling me
at 2:00 in the morning.

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,467
So I was sleeping.

66
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,599
I picked up the phone

67
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,299
and they said,
"Roman's been arrested."

68
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,399
And I said, "what for?"

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,833
And they said,
"rape."

70
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,399
I said...

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,966
I just could not...
It just made no sense.

72
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:16,933
I mean, this is somebody

73
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:19,132
who could not be
a rapist, you know?

74
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,999
I mean, it's somebody I know

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,433
really really well.

76
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,599
- I was working west L.A.
- homicide

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,299
and I also handled sex crimes.

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,999
And I came in to work

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,332
and I had a crime report
on my desk

80
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,366
of a rape
that had been reported.

81
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:41,933
And Roman polanski was
the named suspect in it.

82
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:44,599
After I received the report
I started the follow-up.

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,599
I went to interview
the victim and her mother.

84
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,032
I did an extensive
interview with them,

85
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:53,666
made sure that any
physical evidence

86
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,733
would have been recovered
from her that she had,

87
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:58,699
and then I went

88
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,532
and talked to the district
attorney's office.

89
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,566
Vannatter came into the office

90
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,933
and we sat down and
he ran the case by me.

91
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:07,666
He showed me the incident
report, a crime report

92
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,299
taken by a couple
of patrol officers,

93
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,800
which is a narrative
of the facts and stuff.

94
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,499
Time was kind of of the essence,

95
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,265
so we got the search warrant.

96
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,933
It was for two locations...

97
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:24,399
It was for
Jack Nicholson's house

98
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,866
where the crime occurred

99
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:30,065
and also for polanski's suite

100
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:32,966
on the second floor of
the Beverly Wilshire hotel.

101
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,833
Me and my partner,

102
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,032
along with a narcotics officer,

103
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,799
proceeded with the search
warrant to the hotel.

104
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,299
We were walking in
and he was walking out

105
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,232
with a group of people,
obviously going out for the evening.

106
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:49,699
And I told Phil,
I said, "there he is."

107
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,199
And we stopped

108
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,099
because he would have
walked right on by us.

109
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,232
So we said, "Mr. Polanski, l.A.P.D.
We have to talk."

110
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,165
And he came out and he says,
"is this is gonna be

111
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,299
more than a few minutes?
If it is, I'll let my people go."

112
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,466
We said, "yes, it's going to
be more than a few minutes."

113
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,999
We proceeded up to his room and
completed the search warrant,

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,766
which... we did find
the camera equipment,

115
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:13,599
the film that we
ultimately had developed.

116
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,733
And it did show nude
pictures of the victim.

117
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:17,632
Totally nude?

118
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,866
Well, she was in a spa.

119
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,499
You could see the upper
portion of her body.

120
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,466
You couldn't see her whole body

121
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,199
because she was in the water.

122
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,632
But they were nude pictures.

123
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,532
Polanski was nervous.
He was upset.

124
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,799
And he is one of those
people that just talk.

125
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,899
And I suspect

126
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,866
he figures,
"well, if I talk and talk

127
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,165
I can probably talk my
way out of this thing."

128
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,966
He was like on a hyper high.

129
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,933
And he's constantly talking,

130
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,966
constantly fidgeting.

131
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:50,399
And he didn't perceive
having intercourse

132
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,766
with a 13-year-old girl
as against the law.

133
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,766
That was not in his culture.

134
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,432
You know, "so what?"
Type thing.

135
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,232
He didn't realize, I guess,

136
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,999
the laws of our country

137
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,165
as compared to other countries.

138
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:09,332
I'm not so sure that
Mr. Polanski was aware

139
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,500
of what being arrested
in America meant.

140
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:58,999
I know it's a very large
piece of news for all of you.

141
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,866
It's a lot of sensational stuff.

142
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:04,265
But try to go beyond it
and understand my position.

143
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:06,065
It's not the best
type of publicity,

144
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,666
not something I desire.

145
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,133
I have not much to tell you
except that I'm innocent.

146
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,632
When the case arrived here

147
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,733
there was an absolute
mob of publicity...

148
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:23,065
The associated press,
u.P.I.,

149
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:26,432
"New York times,"
"Los Angeles times,"

150
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,699
celebrity mags,
German reporters,

151
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,899
French reporters,
British reporters.

152
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,232
I had never seen
a media feeding frenzy before

153
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:38,399
and this courtroom embodied it.

154
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,132
You couldn't meet anybody,

155
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:42,666
whether he was known
or not known at all

156
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,866
who didn't have an opinion
about this case.

157
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:47,299
And it was one of
the biggest cases.

158
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,399
I didn't work
for weeks and months

159
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,066
on anything else but this case.

160
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:01,132
As the case progressed,
I was struck...

161
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:03,199
You know, how could
the same man be

162
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,065
two different things to two
different sets of press?

163
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,866
The European reporters
looked on polanski

164
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:13,366
as this tragic, brilliant
historic figure.

165
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,099
Here was this man

166
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,499
who had survived the holocaust,

167
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,466
who had survived
the gassing of his mother

168
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,699
and then had come here

169
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,799
and developed his own voice,

170
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,866
had maintained his integrity

171
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:29,466
against the power
of the Hollywood machine.

172
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:32,799
And the American press
tended to look at him

173
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,399
as this sort of
malignant twisted dwarf

174
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,532
with this dark vision.

175
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:40,666
Roman was the perfect
villain for them.

176
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:44,366
He was a foreigner.
He had a thick accent.

177
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:47,032
He made lots of money
in the movie business.

178
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:48,866
He was short.
He was perfect.

179
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:51,566
In California at that time,

180
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:54,332
had he not been who he was...

181
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,265
In other words, a famous

182
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:58,566
controversial director

183
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,399
with the legacy

184
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,532
of his wife's murder behind him,

185
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:06,466
the whole thing would have been

186
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:09,667
completely different.

187
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,833
Roman polanski is 32.

188
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,232
He has just completed
his fourth feature film,

189
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,032
"the vampire killers,"

190
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,632
set in the snow-covered
mountains of transylvania.

191
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,599
He both directs

192
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,100
and plays one
of the leading parts.

193
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,599
Hold it, boys.

194
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,265
Sharon, Sharon.

195
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:53,165
Looking at him, not at me.

196
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,432
Okay?
Yeah.

197
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:56,966
You know where.

198
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,667
Yeah.

199
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,265
Roman polanski
was born in France

200
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:06,199
of Polish parents.
They left there when he was three

201
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,132
and went to live in Poland.

202
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:12,532
I don't know, I think
I'm a nomad, you know?

203
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:15,933
But I...

204
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:18,099
I'm really strongly attached

205
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,733
to Polish background.
I've grown up in Poland.

206
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:26,265
My mother was killed
by Germans very soon

207
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:29,799
and my father was taken
to the concentration camp

208
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,466
after two years of war.
And then I was by myself.

209
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:36,199
One of the first films I've seen

210
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,899
was "snow white," you know?

211
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,999
And I think it influenced me

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,432
enormously forever.

213
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:48,232
And as you see, it's an enormous

214
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,799
influence in my work

215
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,433
like "repulsion"
and "cul-de-sac."

216
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,232
I always wanted
to be a director.

217
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,499
I knew I wanted to make movies.

218
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,566
I knew I wanted to be
a part of it.

219
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:07,567
I knew I wanted to create this.

220
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,866
An American producer
of Polish origin

221
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:14,866
suggested that I come to London

222
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,666
and make a film there.

223
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:20,532
London was fabulous.

224
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,366
You cannot imagine what it meant

225
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,432
for someone who lived

226
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,299
in the grey, drab

227
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,433
communist reality.

228
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,632
It was a very civilized
way of living,

229
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:39,165
rooms always full
of friendly faces.

230
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,165
You saw your friends every day

231
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:44,866
and there were lots of them...

232
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:48,600
Life without limits.

233
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,833
I got a phone call
from a friend of ours,

234
00:14:56,834 --> 00:15:00,265
a mutual friend
who was a film producer.

235
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,966
And he said,
"I've got this friend"

236
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,899
who's coming to London

237
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,799
and he doesn't speak
any English.

238
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,766
"Can you take care
of him?"

239
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,532
I said, "sure,
send him round."

240
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:14,265
Roman was totally exceptional.

241
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:17,499
I was really drawn to him,
and so was everybody else.

242
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,065
Already an established
film director...

243
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,032
No one in London
had heard of him.

244
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:25,366
Few people had seen his films.

245
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:28,766
Yes yes yes.

246
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,734
Go, go again.

247
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,265
That was funny.

248
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:40,866
From coming as
a complete unknown,

249
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:42,666
I would say within six months

250
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,867
everybody knew him.

251
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,632
He was a charismatic fellow.

252
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:56,899
There are very few directors

253
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,232
who have Roman's personality

254
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:02,566
and also his appetite for life...

255
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:05,333
His appetite for life.

256
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:17,999
They met in London

257
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,132
because of a film that he made

258
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:22,567
called "the dance
of the vampires."

259
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:29,199
She was a remarkable person...

260
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,165
Beautiful, gentle,

261
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,065
unsophisticated

262
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:38,733
in the best sense of the word,

263
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:41,866
really a genuine human being.

264
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,199
They were great together

265
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,966
and of course it created
this fantastic love affair.

266
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,500
And it truly was a love affair.

267
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,566
Look, it all started
so long ago.

268
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:40,432
My real problems started then,

269
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:43,632
with the murder of Sharon Tate.

270
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:46,232
I was all right with the press

271
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,500
before that.

272
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,165
They... they wouldn't let it go.

273
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,100
So it's just the story
that will never go.

274
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,566
- Pardon me?
- Why did you want a gag order?

275
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,667
We didn't ask for a gag order.

276
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,766
Who did, Mr. Dalton?

277
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:13,399
No one asked for a gag order.

278
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,399
Then why did the judge
bring it up at this stage?

279
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,099
Well, maybe the judge
can answer that.

280
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,399
The topic of publicity
was discussed

281
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,065
and certain measures
were discussed

282
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:26,499
to try to control the publicity,

283
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,766
but no one asked
for a gag order as such.

284
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:32,132
There was an hour-long
discussion in the chambers.

285
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:35,766
Did that deal principally
with publicity problems?

286
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:38,065
Yes, a great part of it did.

287
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:40,132
What do you see as the problems

288
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,299
with publicity right now?

289
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,966
Well, the problem
with publicity is

290
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:45,566
there's been too much of it.

291
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,899
And of course for me
to go on television

292
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,132
and complain about publicity
is a little inconsistent.

293
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,367
Excuse me.

294
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,899
I've never spoken publicly

295
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,632
about this case before.

296
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:12,332
But if the story is to be told,

297
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,733
I want it to be told factually.

298
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:17,099
I know the facts.
I was there.

299
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,232
Can you give us your reaction

300
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:21,132
to the delay of
the start of the trial?

301
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:22,866
- My reaction to it?
- Yeah.

302
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,666
Well, I'm pleased.

303
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,265
In what way?

304
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,933
Well, there's a good deal
of work-up

305
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,766
that goes into any major case...

306
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,399
People have the right

307
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,366
to their own opinions
about what happened,

308
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,699
but they don't have the
right to their own facts.

309
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,065
The fact of polanski

310
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,999
leaving the country and so forth

311
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,632
seems to have eclipsed

312
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,999
the really important part
of this case

313
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,032
about what actually happened
to the system of justice.

314
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,466
I remain astounded

315
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,799
after all these years.

316
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,200
This case will never leave me.

317
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,432
Defense attorney Doug Dalton

318
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,532
had a very lincolnesque
quality about him,

319
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:05,299
dignified,

320
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,566
not given
to flamboyant gestures.

321
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:10,332
He doesn't raise his
voice in the courtroom.

322
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:14,132
He maintains this calm demeanor.

323
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:18,032
And he was the master
of negotiations.

324
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,432
The fact that Doug
Dalton was the attorney

325
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:24,099
indicated to me
that there would be

326
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,265
a negotiated plea arrived at

327
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,165
between the prosecution,

328
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,266
the defense and the judge.

329
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,866
Douglas Dalton was
a first-class lawyer

330
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,232
but he was definitely matched

331
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,666
by Roger gunson.

332
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,265
The district attorney's office

333
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:44,232
put gunson on the case...

334
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:46,833
A 37-year-old,

335
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:49,299
very straight-thinking mormon.

336
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,199
We are concerned with protecting

337
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,966
the privacy of the girl...

338
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:55,899
The complaining witness
in this case...

339
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,332
And it's my understanding
that there have been

340
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,599
foreign reporters
and investigators

341
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,766
who have attempted to contact
her and have interviews...

342
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:09,032
Gunson was the model
of rectitude.

343
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:11,499
He had that same kind of

344
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,766
handsome-schoolboy,

345
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:18,432
sparkling good looks
as Robert redford.

346
00:21:18,433 --> 00:21:21,733
The rumor in the district
attorney's office was

347
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:26,099
that they picked gunson
to handle the case

348
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,132
because he was a mormon

349
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:30,766
and because he was the only
member of the d.A.'S office

350
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,499
who hadn't had sex
with an underage girl.

351
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,032
I heard some jokes about
why they gave it to me,

352
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:39,699
but I can't imagine
those are accurate.

353
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,165
There were a lot of prosecutors

354
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,699
who had an interest
in high-publicity cases.

355
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,399
Although I had had one
very high publicity case,

356
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,499
I was not one
that looked for them.

357
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,032
They were the perfect attorneys

358
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,966
to handle a case like this

359
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,699
where the evidence
and the players

360
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,599
were sensational,

361
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,833
were dramatic, flamboyant.

362
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:04,866
So you want two attorneys

363
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:07,532
who kept an even keel.

364
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:09,532
They were in that regard

365
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,499
very strikingly different

366
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,533
from the judge in the case.

367
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:17,032
When the grand jury

368
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,933
came back with the indictment,

369
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:22,265
judge rittenband,
who was very interested

370
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:24,499
in handling celebrity cases

371
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,432
obviously saw it

372
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,366
and realized that he wanted it

373
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:30,833
and went to the presiding judge

374
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,699
and said, "hey,
I want this case."

375
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,632
He was of course the senior
judge in Santa Monica,

376
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:38,265
which was the choice
location for any judge

377
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:40,099
because that's where you get

378
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,032
a lot of these
high-publicity cases.

379
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:44,632
Judge rittenband had handled

380
00:22:44,633 --> 00:22:46,999
a Cary Grant paternity suit.

381
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,299
He had handled, well,

382
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,199
the Priscilla and Elvis divorce,

383
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,866
the Marlon Brando custody suit

384
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:58,232
that went on forever.

385
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,866
There were quite a few.

386
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:03,299
I spoke to judge rittenband

387
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,265
very frequently.

388
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:08,432
And he liked

389
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:10,632
being among the stars

390
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:13,166
but I don't think
he was starstruck.

391
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,999
Rittenband loved the press,

392
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,032
always had comments
for the press.

393
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,299
He wanted to shape

394
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,299
the way the press covered him.

395
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,532
Sitting up there on the bench,

396
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,366
he acted like a director,

397
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:43,666
a tyrannical director
calling the shots,

398
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,899
telling people when
to make their entrances,

399
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,766
what to say,
where to position themselves.

400
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:51,366
Well, we misspoke
ourselves, your honor.

401
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:54,099
There's obviously other
basis for the motion.

402
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,866
Yes, we don't need that anymore.

403
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,899
There were a lot of similarities

404
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,934
between judge rittenband
and Roman polanski.

405
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,632
Not too tall in stature.

406
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:07,032
He liked the ladies
and he loved to dance.

407
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:09,499
He had his friends
in the movie industry

408
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,199
which he'd see every day

409
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,000
at the hillcrest country club.

410
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:17,699
When I first met him

411
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,733
I was answering phones.
And he used to say

412
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:21,733
"I'm going to hillcrest.
I'm going to hillcrest."

413
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:23,766
And finally I stop and I says,

414
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,766
"what is going on
at hillcrest?"

415
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,733
You know,
"is your wife there?"

416
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:29,833
Because I didn't know
if he was married or not.

417
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,833
And he said,
"oh, I'm not married."

418
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:35,100
And I said,
"oh, okay."

419
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:40,265
I was 20 years old.

420
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:41,999
He was 34 years older.

421
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,099
He was 54 when I met him.

422
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,232
And we became friends.

423
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:50,165
Oh, golly,

424
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,165
practically every evening
he'd come here

425
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,766
and he'd sit over in that chair.

426
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:57,132
And he loved champagne.

427
00:24:57,133 --> 00:25:01,499
So I'd get champagne
by the case.

428
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,332
"Judge rittenband," I said,

429
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,432
"what would you at your
age do with a girlfriend?"

430
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:07,399
He said, "I'd do the
same thing that you did"

431
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,733
and probably better."

432
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:10,299
And I said,
"tell me about it."

433
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,733
He said, "I got one that cooks"

434
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:14,000
and one that does
the other things."

435
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,099
Rittenband was known
as a hammer.

436
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,332
That means that
he was a tough judge

437
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,699
and a tough sentencer.

438
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,632
If you didn't make a deal

439
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:31,632
and you didn't have
the deal in place

440
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:33,666
when you went in there,

441
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,367
you were in trouble.

442
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:40,165
I don't remember any judge

443
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:42,032
that liked publicity
like rittenband did.

444
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:45,899
He had his bailiff
maintain a scrapbook

445
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,632
that went back many years

446
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,366
and if an article
appeared anywhere

447
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,666
about something involving
Lawrence j. Rittenband

448
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,833
it wound up in the scrapbook.

449
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,966
It was kept
somewhere in the court,

450
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,866
I think in the bailiff's desk,

451
00:25:57,867 --> 00:25:59,899
and on occasion

452
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,199
would come out...
And be displayed.

453
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,866
Judge rittenband
was receiving requests

454
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,766
from people all over the world,

455
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,466
from news agencies

456
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,399
wanting one of the seats
in his courtroom.

457
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,299
He was soliciting reservations

458
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,099
for each one of these chairs.

459
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,100
So it was going to be
a real circus.

460
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:02,933
If you gentlemen would
just stand still,

461
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:04,699
Mr. Polanski
will stay here

462
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,200
and you can get your shot.

463
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:08,933
Because another trial
in the same courtroom

464
00:28:08,934 --> 00:28:10,899
is taking much longer
than expected,

465
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,099
the rape trial of Roman polanski

466
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,232
has been delayed
until August 9th,

467
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,265
exactly eight years to the day

468
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:19,332
his late wife,
actress Sharon Tate,

469
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,066
was brutally murdered.

470
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:27,933
At that time rape victims' names

471
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:29,899
didn't get reported
in the press,

472
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,432
much less the names of minors

473
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:33,399
who were involved in sex cases.

474
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,632
But with the European
press there,

475
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:37,265
her name would come out,

476
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:40,165
exposed in the press,
her background exposed.

477
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,566
The fact that she had
had a prior relationship,

478
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:44,632
that she had taken
quaaludes before...

479
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:46,666
All of this
would have gotten out

480
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,300
and would have
forever haunted her.

481
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:54,933
Once we knew her name,

482
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:58,432
we knew where her school was,

483
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:02,532
we knew where her house was.

484
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,866
The French competition
were after this girl.

485
00:29:05,867 --> 00:29:08,533
They were hunting this girl.

486
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:17,766
It was awful.

487
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:20,366
Everybody knew at school.

488
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,966
People came to school
with cameras

489
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:27,466
and things were being
said and printed.

490
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:29,499
The worst part was,

491
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,265
no one believed me.

492
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:33,666
Everybody thought
I was making it up.

493
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,532
It was so traumatic,

494
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,899
starting that night when
my mom called the police.

495
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,966
And the police come over and
they take you to the hospital,

496
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:41,799
then they take you
to the police station.

497
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,466
And the next morning we're getting
up at 6:30, we're going to court

498
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,766
where they're gonna sneak
you in and all these men

499
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:49,399
are gonna ask you
exactly what happened.

500
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,265
Then they're gonna

501
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:53,399
sit a lady behind you
you can't even see,

502
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,700
because then there's
a lady there.

503
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,199
All that stuff was so traumatic

504
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,332
that I never even had a chance

505
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,499
to really, you know,

506
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,432
worry about, you know,

507
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:03,499
what happened
that night with him.

508
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,532
It was like...

509
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,933
It just...

510
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:11,566
I had to worry about
surviving the next day.

511
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:15,065
The facts indicate that
before the alleged act

512
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:16,699
in this case

513
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,232
this girl had engaged
in sexual activity.

514
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:22,065
That's contained in reports
that we now have.

515
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:24,733
We want to know about it.
We want to know who was involved when.

516
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:26,733
We want to know
why these other people

517
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:28,232
were not prosecuted.

518
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:30,032
And this is a thing
we want to fully develop.

519
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:32,032
I would just as soon

520
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:34,132
have walked away from it
the next day.

521
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:38,065
But you can't stop it
once it starts.

522
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:40,899
I mean,

523
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,632
I just...

524
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:46,165
I just went in my room,

525
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:49,633
pretty much,
and just turned it off.

526
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,666
In "Chinatown,"

527
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:55,032
he exposed the dark side
of corruption.

528
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:58,933
In "repulsion,"
he explored a warped mind.

529
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:00,733
In "Rosemary's baby,"

530
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:02,632
he examined the occult.

531
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:05,532
Now something altogether new,

532
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,432
altogether chilling...

533
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:11,567
No one does it to you
like Roman polanski.

534
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,599
I wanted to find more out

535
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,666
about Mr. Polanski.

536
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,099
And luck have it,

537
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,733
the nuart theatre
right down the street

538
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,466
on Santa Monica boulevard

539
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:27,332
had a polanski film festival

540
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,432
right after the indictment

541
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:31,399
and before trial.

542
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,933
Murder and treason!

543
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:35,800
What have you done to its eyes?

544
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,100
Forget it, Jake.
It's Chinatown.

545
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:47,065
Every Roman polanski movie

546
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,032
has the theme...

547
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:53,400
Corruption meeting innocence
over water.

548
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:59,299
I says, "oh, well,
that's sort of what we have here..."

549
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,799
Corruption, Roman polanski,

550
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,899
meeting innocence,
the 13-year-old girl,

551
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,433
over water, meaning the jacuzzi.

552
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:11,566
I felt I was going to be able

553
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:14,199
to pretty well convey
to some jurors

554
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,599
that this happened

555
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,899
and he had directed a scene

556
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,265
very similar to this
in his real life.

557
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,165
You'd better have
your legs tied down

558
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:27,567
in case of convulsions.

559
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,833
"Rosemary's baby"
was such a great movie

560
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:37,299
and was so well made

561
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,667
that people took it
for the real thing.

562
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:55,366
This is no dream!
This is really happening!

563
00:33:55,367 --> 00:34:00,332
After that Roman had
this reputation

564
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,532
of maybe having been
a little bit

565
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:04,667
in league with the devil
himself.

566
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,432
It didn't hurt him.

567
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,399
People were very intrigued

568
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,399
and it was
kind of sexy in a way.

569
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,499
He had a tremendous power
over people.

570
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,833
You had to fall in love
with him, you know.

571
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:22,466
It was completely infectious.

572
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:24,466
There was no resisting him.

573
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:26,499
And every day was so vibrant

574
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,799
because he felt so passionately

575
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,532
about what he was doing

576
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:33,699
and he was on an adventure.

577
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,666
One of the things that
you are renowned for

578
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,466
is your recklessness.
You say that you're a reckless person.

579
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,332
- Do I say that?
- You say that very frequently

580
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,332
to all sorts of people you talk
to, though clearly

581
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,866
you're going to deny every
single syllable of it tonight.

582
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:46,999
- Really?
- Mm.

583
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,566
I mean, are you
a reckless person?

584
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,299
Are you afraid of anything?

585
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,867
I am reckless,
but I don't tell people about it.

586
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,332
Roman found California
fantastic.

587
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,866
Of Los Angeles he says...

588
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:09,065
Everything is easy here.

589
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,999
You want to learn karate...
You can learn karate.

590
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,866
You want to play chess...
You can play chess.

591
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:19,199
You want to drive racing cars...

592
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,299
You can drive racing cars.

593
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,033
Everything is accessible
in this town.

594
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:46,632
"Rosemary's baby"
was a huge hit.

595
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:50,065
Roman was on top of the world.

596
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:52,399
Nothing could have been better.

597
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,666
He was in love with Sharon.
They were having great parties.

598
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,132
He was going all over the world.

599
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:58,566
When he was the toast
of the industry,

600
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:00,799
he was hanging out
with all the people

601
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,299
that everybody wanted
to hang out with.

602
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,366
Everybody wanted
a piece of Roman

603
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:08,000
because the work
was so original.

604
00:36:10,266 --> 00:36:13,699
- Roman, Sharon.
- Hi.

605
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,799
This is the very
beautiful Sharon Tate

606
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,499
who I am sure
you've seen in films.

607
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,833
And her husband,
very talented Roman polanski,

608
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:22,866
best known for his original
film "knife in the water,"

609
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:24,332
which he wrote and directed.

610
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,532
And he's also responsible
for "Rosemary's baby,"

611
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:28,265
the picture.

612
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:30,699
And I think a little
later we'll get a chance

613
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,499
to sit down and
talk a little bit

614
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,799
- about sex and films.
- Anytime.

615
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,599
Certainly it was a happy time

616
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,032
for all of us.

617
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,999
Roman was happy.

618
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,299
He was with beautiful Sharon.

619
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,866
Everyone loved her.

620
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:50,132
He loved her.
I loved her.

621
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:52,300
We all loved her.

622
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,866
He was so insecure
about so many things.

623
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,833
Knowing about his childhood...

624
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:04,199
He didn't have
the blueprint for life

625
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,500
that others had.

626
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:10,933
One hoped for Roman, you know,

627
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,766
that this brand-new life

628
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:14,399
with a woman who loved him

629
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,165
and who seemed so right for him,

630
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,032
with a baby,

631
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:21,366
that there would be
this security

632
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:23,799
that he had not had in his life,

633
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,165
and in a new homeland.

634
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:28,299
I mean, the future was his,

635
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,866
we thought.

636
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:34,200
And then everything
just collapsed.

637
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,833
Well, we were preparing a film

638
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:42,799
that I was going to produce

639
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,599
called "the day
of the dolphin."

640
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,799
We were writing
the script in London.

641
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,299
Roman was a perfectionist.

642
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,766
He was always,
"we'll finish it in a couple of days

643
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:54,265
and then do the rest
in L.A."

644
00:37:54,266 --> 00:37:56,399
It was a Saturday.

645
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,332
And the phone rang
and I picked it up.

646
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:03,399
It was our agent bill tennant

647
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,165
who was on the phone.

648
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,599
And I immediately realized

649
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,599
that something was
terribly wrong.

650
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,399
I mean, he was a very
stable kind of guy.

651
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,532
He was absolutely distraught.

652
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:20,432
And I said,
"what is it?"

653
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:22,399
And he said, you know,

654
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,032
something like "they're all dead.
They're all dead."

655
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:28,632
I realized something
awful had happened

656
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:31,400
and I gave the phone to Roman.

657
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:35,900
And...

658
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:41,699
I've never seen
anything like it.

659
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,766
You know, I saw somebody

660
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:47,567
just disintegrate
in front of my eyes.

661
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,933
This was at the home

662
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:04,666
of movie director Roman polanski

663
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:07,499
and it was his wife Sharon Tate
who was one of the victims.

664
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,833
She too had
repeated stab wounds.

665
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:12,666
One of the victims had a
hood placed over his head.

666
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:16,299
And the word "pig" was
written in blood on the door.

667
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,199
- We flew to L.A.
- the next day.

668
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,632
He was devastated,

669
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:26,399
devastated to a point

670
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,766
that I've never seen
any other human being

671
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:32,367
in that kind of condition.

672
00:39:37,633 --> 00:39:39,799
And I remember

673
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,699
picking up
the sunday newspapers.

674
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,132
I was already reasonably aware

675
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:52,065
of how the press functions.

676
00:39:52,066 --> 00:39:56,200
Their business is
selling newspapers.

677
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,299
The story was basically

678
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,766
how Roman had flown
to Los Angeles,

679
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,232
murdered them all
and then come back.

680
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:07,265
I mean, this was actually

681
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:09,332
in the newspapers,

682
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,567
in the headlines.

683
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:17,599
The nature of the murders,

684
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,966
you know, satanism,
"Rosemary's baby,"

685
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,132
"this is the guy who made
'Rosemary's baby.'"

686
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:24,232
he knew so much about it.
He couldn't have known

687
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:27,299
so much about it without
actually being involved in it.

688
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,065
And so he must have been
part of the cult.

689
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:31,966
And there was a cult.
And they were murdered.

690
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:33,999
"And who gets murdered
in this kind of way?"

691
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,099
It was a typical example

692
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,366
of the victim's
being responsible

693
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:41,966
for their own death.

694
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:43,933
It was shocking.

695
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:46,133
It was truly unbelievable.

696
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,232
The last day I talked to her

697
00:40:50,233 --> 00:40:53,967
was a few hours before
the tragedy happened.

698
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,165
You are certainly curious

699
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:04,632
about my relationship
with Sharon

700
00:41:04,633 --> 00:41:09,333
within last few months.

701
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:13,566
I can tell you
that the last few months

702
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:16,232
as much as the last few years

703
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:19,834
I spent with her...

704
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,065
Were the only time

705
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:31,199
of true happiness in my life.

706
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,299
And facts
which will be coming out

707
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,532
day after day

708
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:39,466
will make ashamed

709
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:42,099
a lot of newsmen

710
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,099
who for a selfish reason

711
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,699
write unbearable for me,

712
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,699
horrible things

713
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,600
about my wife.

714
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,165
After Sharon was murdered

715
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,799
really everybody was
totally freaked out.

716
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,399
It was a very weird time,

717
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,666
the highest paranoia,

718
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:09,933
the transition

719
00:42:09,934 --> 00:42:14,632
of this sort of hippie
kind of existence in L.A.

720
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:20,499
To this brutal awakening

721
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,065
of an understanding

722
00:42:25,066 --> 00:42:27,065
that these kind of absolutely

723
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:30,367
horrible events can happen.

724
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:35,065
No one locked their doors.

725
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:37,566
No one thought about
that there was

726
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:39,966
any kind of threat.

727
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:42,999
That ended at the end
of the '60s

728
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,699
and simultaneously

729
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,266
changed everything
overnight in L.A.

730
00:42:53,834 --> 00:42:56,532
It was the end
of a fairy tale, really,

731
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,165
in Roman's life,

732
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:02,232
in everybody's life.

733
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:06,466
He would have been
a father of a son

734
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:08,499
who would have now been,

735
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,165
what, 30 years old?

736
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,833
Maybe he would have had
other children,

737
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:14,933
probably would have continued

738
00:43:14,934 --> 00:43:17,332
living in California.

739
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:20,933
Who knows?

740
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:23,999
How does one survive?

741
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,165
When you know his childhood...

742
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,400
He's a very very strong
human being.

743
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:34,966
I think that the idea

744
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:37,165
of the magnet of tragedy

745
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,265
started after the Tate murders.

746
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:41,165
He was living out in Malibu

747
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:44,499
and the neighbors were all,
like, horrified

748
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,532
because somehow if he was
in the house next door

749
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:50,032
there was going to be
another mass murder.

750
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:52,466
I mean, people are
just too weird.

751
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:55,300
I tell you, it's crazy.

752
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,266
- Hold it there, kitty-cat!
- Hold it.

753
00:44:12,133 --> 00:44:15,500
Hello, Claude.
Where did you get the midget?

754
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:22,632
You're a very nosy fellow,
kitty-cat.

755
00:44:22,633 --> 00:44:24,833
Do you know what happens
to nosy fellows?

756
00:44:24,834 --> 00:44:26,833
Huh? No?

757
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:29,332
Wanna guess?
Huh? No?

758
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,700
Okay, they lose their noses.

759
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:39,032
Next time you'll lose
the whole thing...

760
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:42,532
Cut if off and feed it
to my goldfish.

761
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:44,566
Roman was different

762
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:46,432
when I met him
on "Chinatown."

763
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,099
He was still a guy
that loved life.

764
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,132
There was just
this real dark shadow

765
00:44:50,133 --> 00:44:52,232
that he had to deal with
every day...

766
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:55,132
That, you know,
there were people who were constantly,

767
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:56,966
"so what was it like, you know,

768
00:44:56,967 --> 00:45:00,099
when Sharon...
When your wife was killed?"

769
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,532
Do you hate certain
members of the press

770
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,799
for the way you were treated

771
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,666
after your wife's murder?

772
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:12,299
Well, yes, to be honest, I do.

773
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,899
But I wouldn't call it
a hatred now, you see.

774
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,733
It's somehow evolved
to just indifference.

775
00:45:18,734 --> 00:45:21,232
And I simply don't read it
and try to avoid it.

776
00:45:21,233 --> 00:45:22,432
Yeah.

777
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:23,733
But in general,

778
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:26,032
I despise the press tremendously

779
00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:29,699
for its inaccuracy,
for its irresponsibility

780
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,499
and for its

781
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,733
often even deliberate cruelty.

782
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,232
And all this is
for lucrative purposes.

783
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,366
If one of your complaints

784
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:42,032
is the way the press
misrepresents you...

785
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:43,632
And that is one of your
complaints, isn't it?

786
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:45,499
Then surely it would be
a good tactic

787
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,265
to give them the minimum
possible target.

788
00:45:47,266 --> 00:45:49,532
Yes, but then you have to...

789
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:51,466
You have to change
your lifestyle

790
00:45:51,467 --> 00:45:53,899
completely and go into hiding.

791
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,833
It seems like, say,
six months after the murders

792
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:58,499
you're in the alps
and consorting

793
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,999
with these girls from the
finishing school and so on.

794
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,432
I can see how you would sort of

795
00:46:03,433 --> 00:46:06,232
try to lose yourself like that.

796
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:08,165
But is it wise to say so?

797
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,532
Yes, it is wise to say so.

798
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:12,099
Why not?

799
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,065
Why wouldn't it be
wise to say so?

800
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:15,866
That's the way it was.

801
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:18,566
And that's the way it is.
You know, I mean, just...

802
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,332
Different people
have different way

803
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:24,733
of seeing life
and relationships.

804
00:46:24,734 --> 00:46:29,199
It's not necessarily the
same with you than me.

805
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,232
And people react

806
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:34,032
in different ways to grief.

807
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:37,165
Some go to a monastery,

808
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:39,833
others start

809
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:43,433
visiting whorehouses.

810
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:51,466
He decided he was gonna survive,

811
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:53,466
and the way he was gonna survive

812
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:57,100
is through his talent
and having fun.

813
00:46:58,166 --> 00:47:00,199
Whether it was dinner for four

814
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,199
and he was holding court
with some idea he had,

815
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,733
or whether it was a group

816
00:47:05,734 --> 00:47:08,532
of 30 or 40 or 50,

817
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:12,332
he liked to be
the center of it all.

818
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,699
He was a wonderful host,

819
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,833
almost like a dance master.

820
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,499
He kept it all sort of stirred.

821
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,366
It gave him enormous pleasure.

822
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:25,999
And after Sharon

823
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,500
I think he didn't want
to be alone too much.

824
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:33,133
It's not so good to be alone.

825
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,065
Everybody knows

826
00:47:39,066 --> 00:47:42,065
the best way to get
close to your dream

827
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:46,032
is to get to know
a star, a real star.

828
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,532
Polanski after "Chinatown"

829
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,432
was not only a real star,

830
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:56,199
he was "the Roman polanski,"

831
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,432
a big name.

832
00:47:58,433 --> 00:48:02,766
She wouldn't mind
being discovered

833
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:04,566
by a man like Roman polanski.

834
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:07,599
After all, she had seen
in the French "vogue"

835
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,599
pictures of nastassja kinski

836
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,833
who was 15 when she started

837
00:48:11,834 --> 00:48:14,265
her affair with Roman polanski,

838
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,265
or Roman started it with her.

839
00:48:16,266 --> 00:48:18,265
And everybody had the opinion

840
00:48:18,266 --> 00:48:20,733
if polanski wouldn't have done

841
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:23,432
this photo layout
with nastassja,

842
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,432
she would have never become

843
00:48:25,433 --> 00:48:28,433
such a well-known young star.

844
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,165
He was a friend of a guy

845
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:35,065
my sister was dating.

846
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:38,032
And he wanted girls to model.

847
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:40,399
And I was modeling and acting

848
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,466
and wanted, you know,
to be in the business.

849
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:44,599
So that was a great
opportunity, you know.

850
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,866
We signed right up.
"Sure, have my pictures taken

851
00:48:46,867 --> 00:48:50,033
by Roman polanski.
Sounds great."

852
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:54,032
Susie gaily,

853
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:56,833
the mother
of the alleged victim,

854
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:59,699
introduced herself

855
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,799
as an actress to polanski.

856
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,766
And she had done
some work in films.

857
00:49:06,767 --> 00:49:09,699
Well, I was innocent, see.

858
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,800
And that's the truth.

859
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,599
What else can I say?

860
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,032
I remember vaguely

861
00:49:18,033 --> 00:49:20,165
meeting the mother
at some party...

862
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,799
You know,
like, "hi."

863
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,265
And then I was away

864
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:27,666
and then heard
about all of this.

865
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:30,065
But just in what I was told

866
00:49:30,066 --> 00:49:31,899
and what I read,

867
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,366
I kept going back
to the same question...

868
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:36,366
"why did the mother

869
00:49:36,367 --> 00:49:40,799
bring her 13-year-old
daughter into this group?"

870
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,933
Especially if she had
spent time with them

871
00:49:42,934 --> 00:49:45,466
and all the things
that she said subsequently

872
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:47,432
were true... wouldn't you keep

873
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:49,933
your 13-year-old daughter
away from that?

874
00:49:49,934 --> 00:49:51,666
You know, this was a guy

875
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:53,566
that had a pretty
wild reputation.

876
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:57,099
He was known as a womanizer.

877
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,699
He's a partygoer.

878
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,733
He certainly had a lot
of women over the years

879
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:04,799
and he loved young women.

880
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,532
Why would her mother allow her

881
00:50:06,533 --> 00:50:09,032
to be alone with polanski?

882
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:11,499
I don't like... you always
get the "where was your mom?"

883
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,332
It's like, you know,
give my mom a break.

884
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,199
You know, it's not her fault.

885
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,399
And so...

886
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,265
You know, I don't like hearing

887
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:22,766
anybody's opinion on it.

888
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:24,399
Like, every time
someone brings it up,

889
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,399
and they're doing their little,
you know, banter on t.V.

890
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,499
It's like, you weren't there.
You don't know.

891
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,432
What are you talking about?
You're saying how I felt,

892
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:33,366
what happened,
how you feel about polanski.

893
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:35,265
You have no idea.
And you're on the news

894
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,866
making all these statements

895
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,033
and thousands of people are
listening to you and... shut up.

896
00:50:41,734 --> 00:50:43,999
Another hearing
on the admissibility

897
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,933
of the Beverly Wilshire
hotel records

898
00:50:45,934 --> 00:50:48,032
has been set for next Friday.

899
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:50,065
From Santa Monica,
fernell Chapman,

900
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:51,867
news center 4.

901
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:06,699
I was instrumental

902
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,399
in arranging the plea bargain

903
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,366
because as I looked

904
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:14,099
at this family and Samantha,
I thought...

905
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,132
At the time some
people knew her name

906
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:19,332
and some of the kids at
school knew who she was.

907
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:22,032
I thought it was important

908
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:24,899
to try to maintain
her anonymity,

909
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,899
anonymity which
would have disappeared

910
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,733
if the case had gone to trial.

911
00:51:28,734 --> 00:51:32,265
And so I tried to persuade
the district attorney

912
00:51:32,266 --> 00:51:34,332
who had a new
plea bargaining policy,

913
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:36,599
a tough plea bargaining policy.

914
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,099
I said, "I'm not gonna do it."

915
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,566
I have no interest
in doing it."

916
00:51:41,567 --> 00:51:44,032
And so what he decided was...

917
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:46,700
He says, "well,
I'm gonna do it myself."

918
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,499
The l.A.P.D. Brought

919
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,232
the evidence envelope

920
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:09,232
to this courthouse building

921
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:12,265
and brought it in,
actually, to this room.

922
00:52:12,266 --> 00:52:15,165
There were about
five, six or seven men

923
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:18,799
standing around,

924
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,599
looking, peering down

925
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,399
at this evidence envelope

926
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,599
and someone takes it
and turns it and opens it

927
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,566
and out falls

928
00:52:26,567 --> 00:52:29,099
these little girl's panties.

929
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,632
And so there was

930
00:52:31,633 --> 00:52:33,632
this enormous court battle

931
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:35,899
over property
that belonged to her

932
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,899
as to what was
to be done with them.

933
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,833
And judge rittenband decided

934
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:43,065
to cut it in half

935
00:52:43,066 --> 00:52:45,766
and give half to the prosecution

936
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:47,399
and half to the defense.

937
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,499
The defense expert went over
and put on his latex gloves

938
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,332
and came back and then started

939
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:58,966
operating on these
copper panties.

940
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,899
If you can imagine the humor

941
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,132
of about seven men
sitting around a table...

942
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:05,232
...trying to identify
any stains

943
00:53:05,233 --> 00:53:08,065
and to make sure that
the cut, or the piece,

944
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:09,933
includes part of that stain.

945
00:53:09,934 --> 00:53:11,566
And they were fighting...
"no no, it has to be"

946
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,899
just a little to this way.
No, it should be over here.

947
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,966
"We shouldn't cut that way
at all, we should cut..."

948
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:18,065
so finally they made the cut.

949
00:53:18,066 --> 00:53:19,766
What we understood was

950
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:22,466
that Dalton was going
to take his half

951
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:24,299
and submit it to a lab.

952
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,466
I also understood that the lab

953
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:28,699
was about to give
its report in two weeks.

954
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,933
And two weeks
and three days later

955
00:53:30,934 --> 00:53:32,733
Dalton called me on the phone,

956
00:53:32,734 --> 00:53:34,065
clearly now, I think,

957
00:53:34,066 --> 00:53:36,466
having the results
of the lab report,

958
00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:38,566
saying, you know,

959
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:41,299
"what do you think would happen"

960
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,766
if we pursued a plea bargain

961
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:46,666
"with the prosecution?"

962
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:48,933
At which point...
At that point I realized

963
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,199
that now polanski
had an interest,

964
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,999
that the stain in the panties

965
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,600
was going to be brutal
evidence for them.

966
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:03,766
The prosecution
had loaded polanski up

967
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:06,265
with multiple charges.

968
00:54:06,266 --> 00:54:09,399
The only one
he was willing to admit

969
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,566
and to plead guilty to

970
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:13,499
was that he had had

971
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,066
consensual sex with the minor.

972
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:33,699
Mr. Dalton asked,

973
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,733
"could it be a misdemeanor..."

974
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:37,132
and I says, "no."

975
00:54:37,133 --> 00:54:39,632
"... That he not go
to state prison?"

976
00:54:39,633 --> 00:54:41,933
I says, "no, that's got
to be open."

977
00:54:41,934 --> 00:54:45,666
And so he agreed to all those

978
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:48,766
and we agreed that it'd be
unlawful sexual intercourse...

979
00:54:48,767 --> 00:54:51,032
The lowest count

980
00:54:51,033 --> 00:54:55,265
that related to the gravamen.

981
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:58,366
The agreement was

982
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:00,432
that polanski would plead guilty

983
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:02,466
to the one count,

984
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:05,399
that he would be sentenced

985
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,899
based upon the probation report

986
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,766
and the argument of counsel.

987
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,699
At that time the sentence

988
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,432
for unlawful
sexual intercourse was

989
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:18,632
what they characterized as
an indeterminate sentence,

990
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:20,632
so you're sent to state prison

991
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:24,499
for anywhere from six
months to 50 years.

992
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,766
I checked and
there hadn't been anyone

993
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:29,733
sent to prison for a
conviction of this offense

994
00:55:29,734 --> 00:55:31,866
in the year preceding

995
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:34,099
Roman polanski's case.

996
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,199
I thought it was
a very good disposition,

997
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,599
for the reason
that it vindicated

998
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,399
the family and the girl

999
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,065
and it exposed
Mr. Polanski

1000
00:55:44,066 --> 00:55:47,032
to significant time in custody

1001
00:55:47,033 --> 00:55:49,499
based upon a probation report.

1002
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,666
By entering his guilty plea,

1003
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:54,666
polanski avoided going to trial,

1004
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:56,799
a trial that was
to have begun tomorrow,

1005
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,032
the eighth anniversary
of his wife's death

1006
00:55:59,033 --> 00:56:01,734
at the hands of
the Charles manson family.

1007
00:56:03,233 --> 00:56:05,666
Standing with his lawyer
Douglas Dalton,

1008
00:56:05,667 --> 00:56:09,099
polanski was asked by deputy
district attorney Roger gunson

1009
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,566
to what count he pleaded guilty.

1010
00:56:11,567 --> 00:56:13,733
"I had intercourse"

1011
00:56:13,734 --> 00:56:16,032
with a female person,
not my wife,

1012
00:56:16,033 --> 00:56:17,866
"who was under
18 years of age."

1013
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:21,766
"How old did you think
the girl was?"

1014
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:25,032
"I understood she was 13."

1015
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:27,299
The plea bargaining
was the result

1016
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,299
of a request by attorney
Lawrence silver,

1017
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,432
representing the girl's family.

1018
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:33,366
Silver asked
judge Lawrence rittenband

1019
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,132
to accept the plea
and protect the girl

1020
00:56:35,133 --> 00:56:36,666
from the glare of publicity.

1021
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:40,432
"A stigma would attach
to her for a lifetime

1022
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:43,166
and justice is not made
of such stuff."

1023
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,366
Judge rittenband
in accepting the guilty plea

1024
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:49,966
ordered polanski to be
examined by two psychiatrists.

1025
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:51,899
Sentencing will come after that,

1026
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,599
when the judge could
declare the director

1027
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,399
a mentally disordered
sex offender.

1028
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,666
That could result in commitment
to a state mental hospital.

1029
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,666
Other possible sentences include

1030
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,265
one year in county jail,

1031
00:57:03,266 --> 00:57:05,265
up to 50 years
in a state prison,

1032
00:57:05,266 --> 00:57:08,100
deportation or probation.

1033
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:14,966
We took our chances,
obviously, here

1034
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:19,432
because we had no idea
or no way of knowing

1035
00:57:19,433 --> 00:57:23,367
what the probation department
would conclude.

1036
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,632
Judge rittenband appointed me

1037
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:44,599
to evaluate Mr. Polanski
for purposes of determining

1038
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,599
whether he was at that time

1039
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,032
a mentally disordered
sex offender,

1040
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,132
which was a legal term

1041
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:54,065
having to do with an individual

1042
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:56,366
who, by reason
of a mental disorder,

1043
00:57:56,367 --> 00:57:58,165
was predisposed

1044
00:57:58,166 --> 00:58:00,132
to the commission
of sexual offenses

1045
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:01,799
that rendered him a danger

1046
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,499
to the health and safety
of others.

1047
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,399
He was a very congenial

1048
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,432
but somewhat reserved guy

1049
00:58:08,433 --> 00:58:11,232
who was very straightforward

1050
00:58:11,233 --> 00:58:13,999
in the interview.

1051
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,566
As experiences go,

1052
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:19,332
Roman polanski has had more

1053
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:22,799
than what would impact
on a dozen people,

1054
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,766
in terms of his life
as a child, confusion.

1055
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:29,366
And ultimately he gets
what he feels

1056
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:31,232
is a stable relationship

1057
00:58:31,233 --> 00:58:33,132
and that's taken away from him

1058
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:35,499
at the snap of a finger.

1059
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,532
He had difficulty

1060
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:40,299
in developing relationships
with women after that.

1061
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:44,733
I think he felt
very very hesitant,

1062
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:46,966
maybe out of fear.

1063
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:49,299
My opinion paralleled

1064
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,199
the recommendation

1065
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,866
of the probation department.

1066
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:56,232
I didn't talk about whether he
should or should not go to jail.

1067
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:58,699
I really focused solely
on the psychiatric issues.

1068
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,165
And it was my opinion
that Mr. Polanski

1069
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:05,432
did not qualify as a mentally
disordered sex offender

1070
00:59:05,433 --> 00:59:07,767
and should not be
handled as such.

1071
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:12,866
My feeling was

1072
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:14,833
the guy belonged
in state prison.

1073
00:59:14,834 --> 00:59:16,499
Rittenband had asked me
about it.

1074
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,599
I said, "judge,
you're gonna give this guy probation."

1075
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,466
He said, "no no, I want
to send him to jail."

1076
00:59:21,467 --> 00:59:22,899
I said, "you'll never do it."

1077
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,766
Because the first thing
that's gonna happen

1078
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:26,733
"when you sentence him is,
he's gonna appeal it."

1079
00:59:26,734 --> 00:59:28,632
"I'm gonna give him
a year in a county jail"...

1080
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:31,265
That would be the sentence
they'd appeal immediately.

1081
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:33,632
"I'm gonna give him weekends
in a county jail"...

1082
00:59:33,633 --> 00:59:34,766
Immediate appeal.

1083
00:59:34,767 --> 00:59:36,466
No matter what the sentence was

1084
00:59:36,467 --> 00:59:38,632
if it included a day in jail,

1085
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:41,165
Dalton, and correctly so,
would have appealed it.

1086
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:42,866
And it's gonna go all the way up

1087
00:59:42,867 --> 00:59:44,699
to the state supreme court.

1088
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,399
He has the money
and he'll take it

1089
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,833
to the U.S. supreme court
if he thinks he can.

1090
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:51,934
He says, "well, what am I
going to do?"

1091
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,699
The judge called me
into chambers.

1092
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,733
He looked at me and said,

1093
00:59:58,734 --> 01:00:00,733
"dick, tell me,

1094
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:03,466
what the hell do I do
with polanski?"

1095
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:06,366
I went, "whoa, your honor",

1096
01:00:06,367 --> 01:00:08,799
that's your decision,

1097
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,566
that's not mine.
I'm a reporter.

1098
01:00:10,567 --> 01:00:13,199
"I can't advise you
on something like that."

1099
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,599
I hadn't been covering
courts that long,

1100
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,432
but I knew a decision by a judge

1101
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:20,699
was supposed to be
a decision by a judge

1102
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,966
and was not to take in
any advice

1103
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:24,733
from any other person

1104
01:00:24,734 --> 01:00:27,866
other than what was there
in the law books,

1105
01:00:27,867 --> 01:00:31,733
what had been entered
into evidence in the case.

1106
01:00:31,734 --> 01:00:33,733
He says, "well, what am I
going to do?"

1107
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,099
Or what should I do?"

1108
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,199
I said, "you know,
what you should do"

1109
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,766
is send him up
for 90-day observation."

1110
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:43,599
A "12.03.03"
is a diagnostic study

1111
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,699
where a defendant
on a felony case

1112
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,632
is sent to chino
for a 90-day observation.

1113
01:00:49,633 --> 01:00:54,299
It's like an in-depth
probation report.

1114
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,165
And he said, "well,
what will that do?"

1115
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,766
I said, "it's not
a final sentence."

1116
01:00:57,767 --> 01:01:00,700
He can't appeal it.
He has to go."

1117
01:01:16,433 --> 01:01:18,332
We were very pleased

1118
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:20,766
when we got
the probation report.

1119
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,833
It recommended
that polanski serve

1120
01:01:22,834 --> 01:01:24,766
no time in custody

1121
01:01:24,767 --> 01:01:29,499
and receive a straight
probationary sentence.

1122
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,499
However, we received a call
from judge rittenband

1123
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,399
asking us to come to chambers,

1124
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,265
that he wanted to discuss
the matter with us.

1125
01:01:37,266 --> 01:01:40,733
A probation officer,
Roger gunson and I

1126
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:42,799
all went into his chambers

1127
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,866
for a meeting.

1128
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,899
At that time the judge said

1129
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,232
he was not going to follow

1130
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:51,966
the recommendation
of the probation department.

1131
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:53,799
He had decided

1132
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,799
that as punishment for polanski

1133
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,632
he was going to send him to
the state prison at chino

1134
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:02,632
for a diagnostic study.

1135
01:02:02,633 --> 01:02:06,232
Gunson and the probation
officer both protested.

1136
01:02:06,233 --> 01:02:08,299
I told him that the law was

1137
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,699
that the diagnostic study

1138
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,733
was not to be used as punishment

1139
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:15,399
or as someone's sentence.

1140
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,165
The courts are not
supposed to use that.

1141
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:19,499
And his response was,

1142
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,065
"I don't want
to send Mr. Polanski"

1143
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:23,933
to county jail

1144
01:02:23,934 --> 01:02:26,466
because I don't want
to be responsible

1145
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:31,399
"if he were to be injured
or killed."

1146
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,232
I said, "judge,
we had not expected this."

1147
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:36,666
Polanski is engaged right now

1148
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:38,933
in directing a large movie

1149
01:02:38,934 --> 01:02:42,032
that involves many people,
millions of dollars.

1150
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:44,766
"This is going to cause
a tremendous hardship."

1151
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:47,032
And he suggested

1152
01:02:47,033 --> 01:02:50,366
that I request a stay,

1153
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,933
the "stay" meaning "to defer"

1154
01:02:52,934 --> 01:02:55,833
or put off this diagnostic study

1155
01:02:55,834 --> 01:02:58,466
in order for polanski to be able

1156
01:02:58,467 --> 01:03:02,400
to complete his work
on the film.

1157
01:03:28,734 --> 01:03:31,532
What he wanted to do was

1158
01:03:31,533 --> 01:03:34,666
have us go out into open court

1159
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:36,999
and pretend as though...

1160
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,599
I don't know if he used
the word "pretend,"

1161
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,165
but not to divulge that we knew

1162
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:44,933
what was going to happen.

1163
01:03:44,934 --> 01:03:47,032
He said, "I want you to go out",

1164
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:50,399
gunson, and you argue

1165
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,799
that polanski should be
placed in custody.

1166
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,833
And Dalton, you go out
and you argue

1167
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:58,733
that he should be
put on probation.

1168
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:01,833
Then I will make my remarks

1169
01:04:01,834 --> 01:04:04,632
and I will sentence him to chino

1170
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:06,432
for the diagnostic study.

1171
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:08,566
And the press need not know

1172
01:04:08,567 --> 01:04:11,399
anything more about this.

1173
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,966
If you do not tell
the press about this

1174
01:04:13,967 --> 01:04:16,165
and if polanski receives
a good report

1175
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:18,099
from the probation department,

1176
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,899
which we all are
quite sure he will,

1177
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,834
"that will conclude
his punishment."

1178
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,399
I wasn't going to argue
about it.

1179
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,432
Polanski's fate
hung in the balance.

1180
01:04:31,433 --> 01:04:33,299
If I started protesting

1181
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,432
about the diagnostic study

1182
01:04:35,433 --> 01:04:37,099
rittenband could well have said,

1183
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,265
"well, I'll just
send him to prison.

1184
01:04:39,266 --> 01:04:40,833
How would you
like that?"

1185
01:04:40,834 --> 01:04:45,866
That was
the... fabrication

1186
01:04:45,867 --> 01:04:48,432
that he...

1187
01:04:48,433 --> 01:04:50,899
The scenario that he
wanted to present

1188
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,867
and he did present.

1189
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,966
This thing had reached the point

1190
01:05:06,967 --> 01:05:10,166
where it was actually
becoming surreal.

1191
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:21,766
Gunson and I walked
into the courtroom

1192
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:23,332
which was packed

1193
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,700
with newsmen and spectators.

1194
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,065
We took our places
at the counsel table,

1195
01:05:31,066 --> 01:05:32,999
sat down and waited

1196
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,899
for the entrance
of judge rittenband.

1197
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,099
I argued first.

1198
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,499
It was a very strange feeling

1199
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,833
to be arguing
when I knew exactly

1200
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:44,799
what the result was going to be.

1201
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,032
It was like having a mock trial.

1202
01:05:47,033 --> 01:05:49,032
In law school we did this,

1203
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:51,366
we had staged trials
and so forth,

1204
01:05:51,367 --> 01:05:54,566
but even then we didn't know
what result was going to be.

1205
01:05:54,567 --> 01:05:56,699
But we dutifully went out.

1206
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:58,899
I argued for probation.

1207
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,132
I tried to make it sound
as authentic as I could.

1208
01:06:02,133 --> 01:06:05,699
Gunson got up
and made his argument.

1209
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,566
And then rittenband proceeded

1210
01:06:08,567 --> 01:06:11,065
to give his closing remarks

1211
01:06:11,066 --> 01:06:13,099
which had been obviously

1212
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:15,065
prepared in advance.

1213
01:06:15,066 --> 01:06:18,232
He argued much better
than either one of us.

1214
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:20,699
And as I sat there
and listened, I thought,

1215
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,866
"I think I see
what's happening here."

1216
01:06:23,867 --> 01:06:26,399
He knows that this is
a probation case.

1217
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,933
The probation department
has recommended probation.

1218
01:06:29,934 --> 01:06:33,366
Chino will very likely
recommend the same thing.

1219
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:35,232
And he wants to condition

1220
01:06:35,233 --> 01:06:37,799
the press and public to the fact

1221
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,099
that when he puts polanski
on probation,

1222
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,366
that they see
the basis that he used

1223
01:06:42,367 --> 01:06:45,766
"in arriving
at that conclusion."

1224
01:06:45,767 --> 01:06:47,799
After 20 minutes in court

1225
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,232
before superior judge
Lawrence rittenband,

1226
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:51,966
film director Roman polanski

1227
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:53,799
and his lawyer Douglas Dalton

1228
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,499
emerged from the courtroom

1229
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,933
amidst a crush of
reporters and cameramen.

1230
01:06:58,934 --> 01:07:01,199
Dalton had asked the court

1231
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,132
to place polanski on probation,

1232
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:05,099
arguing that, though the crime

1233
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,632
of unlawful intercourse
is a serious one,

1234
01:07:07,633 --> 01:07:10,232
it is not a unique crime.

1235
01:07:10,233 --> 01:07:13,933
The prosecutor,
deputy district attorney Roger gunson,

1236
01:07:13,934 --> 01:07:16,165
asked that polanski
be placed in custody,

1237
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,632
though it was noted

1238
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:20,099
that the 13-year-old girl
in the case and her family

1239
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,566
had asked the court not to
incarcerate the film director.

1240
01:07:24,567 --> 01:07:27,466
On the basis of two
psychiatric evaluations,

1241
01:07:27,467 --> 01:07:29,566
the judge ruled
that polanski was not

1242
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:31,532
a mentally disordered
sex offender,

1243
01:07:31,533 --> 01:07:33,332
but he did order polanski
to undergo

1244
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:35,933
90-days' further
psychiatric testing

1245
01:07:35,934 --> 01:07:37,532
at chino state prison,

1246
01:07:37,533 --> 01:07:39,065
postponing a final sentence

1247
01:07:39,066 --> 01:07:41,499
until the testing is completed.

1248
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,699
Judge rittenband
granted polanski

1249
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:46,232
a three-month stay to
conclude his present work.

1250
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:48,299
At the end of that time
the film director

1251
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,933
will go to chino state prison

1252
01:07:49,934 --> 01:07:52,532
for 90-days' diagnostic testing.

1253
01:07:52,533 --> 01:07:55,333
Robin groth, n.B.C. News,
Santa Monica.

1254
01:07:59,734 --> 01:08:02,032
- Why are you leaving the country, sir?
- Sorry?

1255
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:04,332
- Why are you leaving the country?
- Where?

1256
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:06,399
You're gonna leave the
country on a business trip?

1257
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,432
- Yes.
- Can you tell us about that trip?

1258
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:10,199
I'm going to Paris.

1259
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,165
Will you come back?

1260
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:13,899
Will I come back?

1261
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,900
I certainly will.
Don't worry.

1262
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,132
Dino just called up and said,

1263
01:08:32,133 --> 01:08:34,299
"wonderful news.
My god, Lorenzo, we got Roman.

1264
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,699
We got Roman."

1265
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,399
It was a potboiler...

1266
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,065
Pearl divers getting
caught in a giant clam

1267
01:08:42,066 --> 01:08:43,532
and all that stuff.

1268
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:45,933
And Roman had reasonable
contempt for the script...

1269
01:08:45,934 --> 01:08:48,199
Not a picture that
Roman would have done.

1270
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,299
And I imagine... again,
I didn't discuss it,

1271
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,032
but basically nobody else,
I presume,

1272
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:54,032
would hire him at that time.

1273
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:55,599
And de laurentiis,

1274
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,599
seeing a chance to get
a great director

1275
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,899
who otherwise he couldn't
possibly have approached

1276
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:04,165
for this project,
stepped in immediately.

1277
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:06,232
It was a coup, a triumph,

1278
01:09:06,233 --> 01:09:08,065
you know, taking advantage

1279
01:09:08,066 --> 01:09:10,232
of this guy's troubles
to some extent.

1280
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:12,165
Better luck for Roman
would have been a judge

1281
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:14,300
that never allowed him
to go to Europe at all.

1282
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:20,599
Roman called me and said,
"listen,

1283
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,466
I'm here in Munich.
Can we meet?"

1284
01:09:22,467 --> 01:09:23,666
I said,
"of course."

1285
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:26,199
And we decided to go
in the evening

1286
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,165
to see the oktoberfest.

1287
01:09:28,166 --> 01:09:29,833
Roman actually didn't want to go

1288
01:09:29,834 --> 01:09:31,899
but we said,
"you have to see that"

1289
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,599
because this is unbelievable.

1290
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,466
You have never seen
10,000 people

1291
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:37,566
in a tent, drunken.

1292
01:09:37,567 --> 01:09:39,399
"I mean,
you must see that."

1293
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,700
He said, "okay,
I'll go with you."

1294
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,099
So finally we went
to a special box.

1295
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,165
I was with my girlfriend

1296
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:50,500
and two other girlfriends,
you know?

1297
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:20,265
Most unfortunately,

1298
01:10:20,266 --> 01:10:23,032
he was photographed,
caught in a pose

1299
01:10:23,033 --> 01:10:25,866
sitting in between two girls.

1300
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:28,799
It was quite innocent, but,
you know, photographs...

1301
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,799
They say a photograph
doesn't lie.

1302
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,499
Nothing lies
more than a photograph.

1303
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:38,366
Lorenzo semple,
Jr.: Roman always did have bad luck.

1304
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:41,232
This is the kind of thing
that a cautious person

1305
01:10:41,233 --> 01:10:43,632
would not have dreamed of doing.

1306
01:10:43,633 --> 01:10:45,332
I mean, they would
have had themselves

1307
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:47,165
photographed in the cathedral

1308
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:49,132
or doing something like that.

1309
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:53,699
That one photograph
changed everything.

1310
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,432
I took it into rittenband

1311
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:57,632
because I figured it was
something he ought to see.

1312
01:10:57,633 --> 01:10:59,199
And what I told him was,
"you know, judge,"

1313
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,165
you've made so many mistakes,
I think, in this case.

1314
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:04,232
Lookit, he's giving you the finger.
He's flipping you off.

1315
01:11:04,233 --> 01:11:06,666
"Haven't you had
enough of this?"

1316
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:08,866
He says,
"what? What?

1317
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:12,666
He's not getting away
with that."

1318
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:14,699
The judge became furious

1319
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,933
when this appeared in the paper.

1320
01:11:16,934 --> 01:11:18,666
He was interviewed

1321
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:22,699
by a Hollywood gossip
columnist, Marilyn Beck.

1322
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,766
Rittenband told me
that he had been duped.

1323
01:11:24,767 --> 01:11:26,733
I really believe
he had been duped.

1324
01:11:26,734 --> 01:11:29,599
In the interview he said

1325
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,599
that very possibly he wanted

1326
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,499
polanski back in the country

1327
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,399
and polanski could be on
his way to prison now.

1328
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:40,632
That photograph
embarrassed the judge.

1329
01:11:40,633 --> 01:11:42,299
Mr. Polanski
is supposed to be

1330
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,299
very focused and intent
when he's working.

1331
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,332
And this photograph demonstrated

1332
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:48,566
that at that moment
in time he was not.

1333
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:50,666
Why was he in Germany?

1334
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:52,532
He should have been
working hard on a movie.

1335
01:11:52,533 --> 01:11:55,633
Could you clear up that
current misunderstanding?

1336
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,766
The judge ordered Roman

1337
01:12:02,767 --> 01:12:04,933
to come back to the states

1338
01:12:04,934 --> 01:12:09,733
and he called dino in
to testify.

1339
01:12:09,734 --> 01:12:12,032
Dino explained

1340
01:12:12,033 --> 01:12:14,332
through me as the translator

1341
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:17,466
that we were going on
with the production

1342
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:19,566
and the preparation
of the production,

1343
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:22,065
and that this was just part

1344
01:12:22,066 --> 01:12:24,666
of the whole thing
of making movies.

1345
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:26,699
Mr. De laurentiis,
could you explain

1346
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,899
why you sent Mr. Polanski
to Germany?

1347
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,866
Roman was still working
when he was in Munich

1348
01:12:31,867 --> 01:12:34,966
because the distributor
convinced Roman

1349
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:37,232
to come there
and spend the night

1350
01:12:37,233 --> 01:12:39,866
or go out for a few drinks

1351
01:12:39,867 --> 01:12:43,766
and at the same time
talk about "hurricane."

1352
01:12:43,767 --> 01:12:46,399
I've already explained.
I've already explained.

1353
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,599
I don't think
the judge knew that

1354
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,632
or understood that.

1355
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:53,866
And most of all,
he didn't believe it.

1356
01:12:53,867 --> 01:12:56,266
- Okay, now step aside, please.
- Let 'em through.

1357
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,366
De laurentiis testified,
Roman testified.

1358
01:13:01,367 --> 01:13:04,399
There was no evidence
at all to the contrary.

1359
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,065
I rested my case.

1360
01:13:07,066 --> 01:13:09,366
And the ruling had to be,
of course,

1361
01:13:09,367 --> 01:13:12,366
that he was there
on business purposes.

1362
01:13:12,367 --> 01:13:16,000
And that was the finding
of the judge.

1363
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:32,099
I told him, you know,
"you just have to bear up"

1364
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,766
and go through this

1365
01:13:33,767 --> 01:13:35,799
and remember
at the conclusion of this

1366
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,866
this case will be over.

1367
01:13:37,867 --> 01:13:39,866
You'll have no further
time in custody

1368
01:13:39,867 --> 01:13:42,567
"and it will all be
behind you."

1369
01:13:47,033 --> 01:13:48,499
That's Dalton?

1370
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,867
Yeah, that was Dalton,
his lawyer.

1371
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,299
Mr. Dalton, has Mr. Polanski
talked to you

1372
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,132
about his reaction
to coming here

1373
01:14:04,133 --> 01:14:05,833
for this almost
three-month period?

1374
01:14:05,834 --> 01:14:07,232
Yes, he has.
Excuse me,

1375
01:14:07,233 --> 01:14:09,099
I have some business
to conduct in here.

1376
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,667
Has he indicated to you as
to what his feelings are?

1377
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,799
Mr. Polanski, do you have
any statement at all?

1378
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,867
Mr. Polanski,
do you have any statement at all?

1379
01:14:47,433 --> 01:14:49,566
Mr. Polanski,
do you have any statement at all

1380
01:14:49,567 --> 01:14:52,933
regarding this 90-day psychiatric
study that you've come in for?

1381
01:14:52,934 --> 01:14:54,933
- No.
- No statement whatsoever?

1382
01:14:54,934 --> 01:14:57,266
What are your immediate
thoughts right now?

1383
01:14:58,633 --> 01:15:01,100
Any thoughts that
you have at all?

1384
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,733
Will he be given any special
consideration here?

1385
01:15:24,734 --> 01:15:27,933
Nothing other than anybody
else that would come in.

1386
01:15:27,934 --> 01:15:30,099
When we talk about
special housing

1387
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,833
and special consideration,
what we're talking about is...

1388
01:15:32,834 --> 01:15:34,899
Everybody that comes in,
we screen them

1389
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,799
for possible protective
custody housing.

1390
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,500
But we're concerned
for his safety.

1391
01:15:50,533 --> 01:15:52,966
- There were sketches.
- There were locations.

1392
01:15:52,967 --> 01:15:55,499
People had been up to
chino and talked to Roman.

1393
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,733
I mean, he was prepping
the movie from chino.

1394
01:15:58,734 --> 01:16:00,699
Dino and I went to visit Roman.

1395
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,666
Dino, of course, was concerned

1396
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:04,499
as to what was going
to happen with his film.

1397
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,899
I was kind of shocked
when we saw Roman.

1398
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,532
We were sitting outside
at a table,

1399
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:13,499
outside of the prison.
He was nervous,

1400
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,933
always looking over his shoulder

1401
01:16:15,934 --> 01:16:19,332
to see what was in back of him.

1402
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:21,366
He said that he was
concerned about

1403
01:16:21,367 --> 01:16:24,099
what the other prisoners
would do to him

1404
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,132
if they could get near him

1405
01:16:26,133 --> 01:16:27,966
because he was accused

1406
01:16:27,967 --> 01:16:30,200
of being a child molester.

1407
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,232
It was very grim

1408
01:16:36,233 --> 01:16:39,165
and it was a very
frightening place.

1409
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:42,032
You know, this is a hard core...

1410
01:16:42,033 --> 01:16:44,432
You know, murderers.

1411
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,632
Roman was not safe there.

1412
01:16:47,633 --> 01:16:50,266
People get killed there.

1413
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,566
Polanski of course
was delighted.

1414
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:09,332
He felt, as properly he should,

1415
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,866
that he had lived up

1416
01:17:10,867 --> 01:17:12,666
to his obligations in the case...

1417
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:14,232
He had admitted his guilt,

1418
01:17:14,233 --> 01:17:16,366
he served the sentence
that had been imposed...

1419
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:19,367
And now it was over and he
could go on with his life.

1420
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:24,499
I was quite surprised.

1421
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:29,232
Everyone in the criminal
justice system is aware

1422
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:31,265
that 90-day diagnostic studies

1423
01:17:31,266 --> 01:17:33,366
take less than 90 days.

1424
01:17:33,367 --> 01:17:35,332
There are not very many
people, I would guess,

1425
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:38,265
who have had the experience
of it only being 42.

1426
01:17:38,266 --> 01:17:40,799
That's not a punishment.
A punishment...

1427
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,799
You know, he was charged
with very serious crimes.

1428
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,566
You're talking about crimes

1429
01:17:46,567 --> 01:17:49,366
that would incur
state prison time,

1430
01:17:49,367 --> 01:17:52,933
maybe 10, 15, 20 years
in state prison.

1431
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:55,199
A 13-year-old girl,

1432
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,866
where he had sexual
intercourse with her,

1433
01:17:57,867 --> 01:18:00,065
sodomized her, gave her drugs,

1434
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:02,132
gave her alcohol.

1435
01:18:02,133 --> 01:18:05,000
He got off with nothing.

1436
01:18:06,867 --> 01:18:09,232
Mr. Gunson, it's usually
the practice

1437
01:18:09,233 --> 01:18:10,866
of the district
attorney's office

1438
01:18:10,867 --> 01:18:13,399
to prosecute the defendant
to the fullest degree.

1439
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,032
You've deviated apparently
in this case. Why?

1440
01:18:16,033 --> 01:18:18,399
Why did you agree to
copping out on the plea

1441
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,899
if he should have had a
full trial with charges?

1442
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,232
What do you mean, "copping out"?

1443
01:18:22,233 --> 01:18:25,532
Between the time
that the judge agreed

1444
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:29,999
that the 90-day diagnostic
study be his sentence,

1445
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,799
there had been lots
of news media reports

1446
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,032
very critical of the judge.

1447
01:18:35,033 --> 01:18:39,265
And now that it appears
that Mr. Polanski

1448
01:18:39,266 --> 01:18:41,366
will be walking away from a rape

1449
01:18:41,367 --> 01:18:43,532
after just serving 42 days,

1450
01:18:43,533 --> 01:18:45,966
it's going to be
embarrassing to the judge

1451
01:18:45,967 --> 01:18:49,166
and he needs to overcome it.

1452
01:19:04,633 --> 01:19:07,699
My father was at the
hillcrest country club

1453
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:10,132
washing his hands
in the locker room,

1454
01:19:10,133 --> 01:19:13,899
and standing next to him
was judge rittenband.

1455
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,399
And one of gentlemen
at hillcrest

1456
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,132
came up to rittenband and said,

1457
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:20,299
"are you really gonna
let that little Polish

1458
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,299
blah-blah-blah off?"

1459
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,933
And rittenband said,

1460
01:19:23,934 --> 01:19:26,199
"well, he thinks so, but no way."

1461
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,699
We're gonna put that
little blank-blank away

1462
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,300
"for the rest
of his life."

1463
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,833
When we met in his chambers,

1464
01:19:43,834 --> 01:19:46,232
at this time
judge rittenband said

1465
01:19:46,233 --> 01:19:48,566
that he wasn't going to honor

1466
01:19:48,567 --> 01:19:50,499
the promise that he had made

1467
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,499
about releasing polanski

1468
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,265
upon completion
of the diagnostic study.

1469
01:19:55,266 --> 01:19:57,099
He gave as his reason

1470
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:59,899
that he was getting
too much criticism.

1471
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:02,332
The judge says that 42 days

1472
01:20:02,333 --> 01:20:04,532
is not enough time in custody,

1473
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:08,099
that he expected him
to be in there 90 days.

1474
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,499
And so somehow he has to make up

1475
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,432
these 48 days

1476
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:16,966
of the intended sentence of 90.

1477
01:20:16,967 --> 01:20:19,532
Now gunson at this point said,

1478
01:20:19,533 --> 01:20:22,532
"if it's 48 more days you want,"

1479
01:20:22,533 --> 01:20:24,766
why don't you
just give him 48 days

1480
01:20:24,767 --> 01:20:27,032
in the county jail?

1481
01:20:27,033 --> 01:20:29,766
And then you will have
accomplished

1482
01:20:29,767 --> 01:20:32,666
"him serving the full
90 days in jail."

1483
01:20:32,667 --> 01:20:34,599
And rittenband said,

1484
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,799
no, he was not willing
to do that

1485
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,999
because the perception
of a prison sentence

1486
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,767
must be maintained
for the press.

1487
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,299
He told me

1488
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:00,799
that if I would
come back to court

1489
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,399
after the press was gone
and the public was gone,

1490
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,332
that he would then
recall polanski

1491
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:12,533
and he would be
released from prison.

1492
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:34,065
It became obvious to me

1493
01:21:34,066 --> 01:21:36,099
that he wanted him deported

1494
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:39,399
because he did not
want him around here

1495
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,199
embarrassing the judge

1496
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,667
any more than he already had.

1497
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:55,733
He wanted Roman to agree

1498
01:21:55,734 --> 01:21:58,866
that he would voluntarily waive

1499
01:21:58,867 --> 01:22:03,032
any rights he may have
regarding deportation.

1500
01:22:03,033 --> 01:22:05,966
Rittenband had no jurisdiction

1501
01:22:05,967 --> 01:22:08,966
over such matters.
And it is illegal

1502
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:11,132
to impose an illegal condition

1503
01:22:11,133 --> 01:22:13,466
upon somebody
serving time in custody.

1504
01:22:13,467 --> 01:22:15,499
And so we now are in a category

1505
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:19,432
of actual illegal conduct.

1506
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:21,632
This was getting
rather contentious,

1507
01:22:21,633 --> 01:22:23,599
as you might understand,

1508
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,766
and I said, "if we're
going to do that, judge",

1509
01:22:25,767 --> 01:22:28,966
I want to have a hearing
regarding the sentencing

1510
01:22:28,967 --> 01:22:30,766
as we're entitled to do.

1511
01:22:30,767 --> 01:22:32,733
And I want to have
witnesses here

1512
01:22:32,734 --> 01:22:34,532
"and I want
to have a hearing."

1513
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:37,232
And he said, "well,
I'm going to sentence him anyway."

1514
01:22:37,233 --> 01:22:40,933
And if you still insist
on having your hearing

1515
01:22:40,934 --> 01:22:42,766
then I may withdraw these things

1516
01:22:42,767 --> 01:22:44,766
that I told you that I would do

1517
01:22:44,767 --> 01:22:47,032
if you went along
with this thing

1518
01:22:47,033 --> 01:22:50,032
"that I'm going
to do tomorrow."

1519
01:22:50,033 --> 01:22:52,566
The proceeding
was concluded by...

1520
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:55,566
Judge rittenband,
as he had done before,

1521
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:59,199
directed me to argue
for probation.

1522
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:03,532
He wanted gunson to, again,
argue for time in custody.

1523
01:23:03,533 --> 01:23:05,733
And then he would
impose the sentence

1524
01:23:05,734 --> 01:23:07,199
that he had discussed with us.

1525
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,099
I certainly was not arguing

1526
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,132
for state prison in chambers,

1527
01:23:11,133 --> 01:23:13,532
nor did I intend to argue

1528
01:23:13,533 --> 01:23:15,566
that he should send him
to state prison

1529
01:23:15,567 --> 01:23:18,399
to participate in this sham

1530
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,933
that the judge was involved in.

1531
01:23:20,934 --> 01:23:24,466
We got up, we walked
out of the room.

1532
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:28,299
I remember

1533
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,733
saying immediately to gunson,

1534
01:23:30,734 --> 01:23:33,466
"I'm not going to do this again."

1535
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,332
No matter what he does,

1536
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:38,666
"I'm not gonna participate
in this thing."

1537
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:41,432
And gunson said, "I'm not
going to do it either."

1538
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:45,099
As we walked down the aisle

1539
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:49,799
past the chairs of an empty
courtroom at that time,

1540
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,399
Doug Dalton
turned to me and said,

1541
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:56,766
"do you think that I can
trust the judge?"

1542
01:23:56,767 --> 01:23:58,699
And I said

1543
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,799
something that I wish
I hadn't said.

1544
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,766
Maybe it did or didn't
make a difference,

1545
01:24:03,767 --> 01:24:05,499
but I shouldn't have said it.

1546
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,366
And what I said to him was,

1547
01:24:08,367 --> 01:24:12,300
"I don't know why not.
You trusted him once."

1548
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,165
I didn't know
what I was going to do

1549
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:37,833
the following day.

1550
01:24:37,834 --> 01:24:41,532
I did know that I was no
longer going to participate

1551
01:24:41,533 --> 01:24:44,799
in a proceeding that was
being designed solely

1552
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,432
to advance the purposes
of judge rittenband.

1553
01:24:48,433 --> 01:24:50,966
I told Mr. Dalton

1554
01:24:50,967 --> 01:24:54,233
that I would be available to...

1555
01:24:56,734 --> 01:24:58,733
Disclose this information

1556
01:24:58,734 --> 01:25:02,099
to anyone at any place
at any time.

1557
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,599
I contacted Roman

1558
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,432
and I said for them
to come to my office

1559
01:25:06,433 --> 01:25:08,499
and discuss what was
going to happen

1560
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,933
the following morning.

1561
01:25:10,934 --> 01:25:13,199
I told them it was my opinion

1562
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,599
that the sentence
would be illegal,

1563
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,099
that we could probably
obtain relief on appeal,

1564
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,632
but that would involve
a long procedure

1565
01:25:21,633 --> 01:25:24,733
and polanski would be
incarcerated

1566
01:25:24,734 --> 01:25:26,999
during that period of time.

1567
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,232
I said that the judge had said

1568
01:25:30,233 --> 01:25:33,866
that if Roman agreed to waive

1569
01:25:33,867 --> 01:25:36,165
any deportation hearing

1570
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:38,265
and be deported,

1571
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:41,399
that he would then be released

1572
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:45,500
if he also had by then
served 48 days.

1573
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:50,899
Roman said to me,
"can we trust him?"

1574
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,866
And I said,
"no, we can't trust him."

1575
01:25:53,867 --> 01:25:56,799
We have no idea what he may do.

1576
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,332
We've all agreed

1577
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:00,366
that he can no longer be trusted

1578
01:26:00,367 --> 01:26:03,934
"and what he represents
to us is worthless."

1579
01:26:06,734 --> 01:26:09,799
With that, Roman got up,
looked at me

1580
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,199
and I believe he said,
"I'll see you guys later."

1581
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,467
And he left the room.

1582
01:26:29,567 --> 01:26:32,265
There were two or three
other people there.

1583
01:26:32,266 --> 01:26:34,632
And I gave Roman an envelope,

1584
01:26:34,633 --> 01:26:36,899
which I thought was script notes

1585
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,033
or something else.

1586
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,332
The general feeling I had is,

1587
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:49,632
"why is everybody
so nervous?"

1588
01:26:49,633 --> 01:26:53,166
There was an electricity
in the air.

1589
01:27:56,433 --> 01:27:58,432
...have to do with

1590
01:27:58,433 --> 01:28:01,499
what was my conversation
with Mr. Polanski.

1591
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,399
My conversation with him
is protected

1592
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,499
by the attorney/client
privilege.

1593
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,466
I can't divulge to you

1594
01:28:07,467 --> 01:28:09,165
the substance or the content

1595
01:28:09,166 --> 01:28:10,899
of my conversation with him.

1596
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,999
Only to say
what I said in court...

1597
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,499
That he did call me
this morning at my home

1598
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,599
and he told me
he would not be here.

1599
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,299
I asked him to call me again

1600
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,065
because I wanted to discuss
this with him further

1601
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:27,265
and attempt to
persuade him to return.

1602
01:28:27,266 --> 01:28:29,532
He said he would call me again.

1603
01:28:29,533 --> 01:28:31,599
Doug, the court asked you
whether you thought

1604
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,532
you might be able to talk
him into coming back.

1605
01:28:33,533 --> 01:28:35,032
What was your response?

1606
01:28:35,033 --> 01:28:36,532
I said I thought I had

1607
01:28:36,533 --> 01:28:38,432
a reasonable chance
of being successful.

1608
01:28:38,433 --> 01:28:40,666
How will you try to do it?

1609
01:28:40,667 --> 01:28:43,065
Can you tell us
what makes you think

1610
01:28:43,066 --> 01:28:45,332
- he's out of the country?
- No, I can't tell you that.

1611
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:47,499
My belief is that
he's not in the country.

1612
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,666
What happens if he does not come
back, Mr. Dalton?

1613
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:51,666
Then the court goes ahead and...

1614
01:28:51,667 --> 01:28:53,999
Roman polanski is in seclusion,

1615
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,966
his friends say,
inside this fashionable building

1616
01:28:55,967 --> 01:28:57,799
in downtown Paris where
he keeps an apartment.

1617
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,966
He skipped the country
early yesterday

1618
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:03,099
only hours before he was to be sentenced
for illegally having sex with...

1619
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:05,499
He had given her
champagne and a quaalude.

1620
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,132
He has told a friend here

1621
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:09,366
his refrigerator is full,
and he does not intend to leave.

1622
01:29:09,367 --> 01:29:11,399
Many feel the aura of tragedy

1623
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,899
and sensationalism
that surrounds polanski

1624
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:15,566
obscures his brilliance
as a director.

1625
01:29:15,567 --> 01:29:17,999
The judge in the Roman
polanski morals case

1626
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,165
said today he intended to
send polanski back to prison.

1627
01:29:20,166 --> 01:29:22,099
"A year of torture
is enough."

1628
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,499
...has begun proceedings

1629
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,432
to force polanski
back to the United States.

1630
01:29:25,433 --> 01:29:28,199
However, authorities are not
optimistic about succeeding.

1631
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,566
Unfortunately, I'm advised
that the treaty with France

1632
01:29:30,567 --> 01:29:33,132
might not allow for his
return to this country,

1633
01:29:33,133 --> 01:29:35,599
at our request,
to be sentenced on this charge.

1634
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,132
Why is that?

1635
01:29:37,133 --> 01:29:38,399
As far as I can tell,

1636
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,566
the treaty only specifies,
number one, rape.

1637
01:29:41,567 --> 01:29:43,866
As you know, Mr. Polanski
was not convicted of rape.

1638
01:29:43,867 --> 01:29:46,265
He was convicted of
unlawful sexual intercourse,

1639
01:29:46,266 --> 01:29:47,966
and that's a different
crime than rape.

1640
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:50,766
Secondly, the treaty specifies

1641
01:29:50,767 --> 01:29:52,532
that it's discretionary

1642
01:29:52,533 --> 01:29:54,766
on the part of France
to return French citizens.

1643
01:29:54,767 --> 01:29:56,299
In other words,
they have an option.

1644
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,199
They can or they can't,
depending on how they feel

1645
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:01,332
about a particular case or maybe
even possibly a particular person.

1646
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:04,766
Whether the d.A.
Succeeds in extraditing polanski or not,

1647
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:06,366
judge Lawrence rittenband plans

1648
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:09,499
to impose polanski's
sentence on February 14th,

1649
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,833
with or without
the filmmaker's presence.

1650
01:30:11,834 --> 01:30:14,299
The length of time
of course would depend

1651
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:16,165
upon whether or not

1652
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:18,332
there would be a deportation,

1653
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:21,666
or if not deported
involuntarily,

1654
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:24,899
he would agree with the
director of immigration

1655
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:28,032
to consent in writing

1656
01:30:28,033 --> 01:30:30,532
to leaving the country...

1657
01:30:30,533 --> 01:30:32,366
In which case,

1658
01:30:32,367 --> 01:30:35,666
any balance of his stay
in state prison

1659
01:30:35,667 --> 01:30:37,733
would be cut short.

1660
01:30:37,734 --> 01:30:39,833
But it was to be no less

1661
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:43,032
than the full period of 90 days.

1662
01:30:43,033 --> 01:30:46,566
The judge held
a press conference.

1663
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:49,999
Shock waves went through
the judicial community.

1664
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,299
A judge holding
a press conference

1665
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,099
regarding a pending case...

1666
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:59,132
Totally unheard of.

1667
01:30:59,133 --> 01:31:01,733
He said that he intended now

1668
01:31:01,734 --> 01:31:05,733
to sentence polanski
in absentia.

1669
01:31:05,734 --> 01:31:09,332
So I prepared
a challenge for cause

1670
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:11,366
to disqualify a judge.

1671
01:31:11,367 --> 01:31:13,899
If you do this,
you're required to prove

1672
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:16,432
that there are actual prejudices

1673
01:31:16,433 --> 01:31:18,132
existing by the judge

1674
01:31:18,133 --> 01:31:20,532
and that you can't have
a fair trial

1675
01:31:20,533 --> 01:31:23,699
or a fair hearing before him.

1676
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:26,766
I showed the declaration
to Roger gunson.

1677
01:31:26,767 --> 01:31:29,432
He read it very carefully.
He agreed...

1678
01:31:29,433 --> 01:31:31,632
"that's true.
That's what happened.

1679
01:31:31,633 --> 01:31:34,766
I will back you up
if need be."

1680
01:31:34,767 --> 01:31:37,466
The judge was furious.

1681
01:31:37,467 --> 01:31:41,299
He knew the statements in the
declaration were all true.

1682
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,399
He knew that I knew it,
he knew that gunson knew it

1683
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,799
and he knew that Larry
silver knew parts of it.

1684
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,999
And so there was nothing
he could do but step aside.

1685
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,633
He was through and he knew it.

1686
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:10,799
I was young,
but the way I felt was,

1687
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,532
the judge was enjoying
the publicity

1688
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:14,199
and he didn't care about
what happened to me

1689
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,199
and he didn't care about
what happened to polanski.

1690
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,532
He was, like,
orchestrating some little show,

1691
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:21,199
you know, that I didn't
want to be in.

1692
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,666
I clearly hold no brief
for Mr. Polanski.

1693
01:32:23,667 --> 01:32:26,999
And obviously what he did to
Samantha, my client,

1694
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,833
was wrong and outrageous,

1695
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:31,766
but nevertheless, he was supposed
to be treated fairly in court

1696
01:32:31,767 --> 01:32:33,099
and he clearly was not.

1697
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:34,833
I'm not surprised that he left

1698
01:32:34,834 --> 01:32:37,132
under those circumstances.

1699
01:32:37,133 --> 01:32:39,632
Really?

1700
01:32:39,633 --> 01:32:42,300
Yeah.

1701
01:32:46,467 --> 01:32:48,600
Jesus. Wow.

1702
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:55,032
Clive, I think it was
a wonderful idea

1703
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:57,933
to do this interview

1704
01:32:57,934 --> 01:33:01,232
over this lunch,

1705
01:33:01,233 --> 01:33:03,799
but the lunch is getting
into a dinner now.

1706
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,699
And in case if you have in mind

1707
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:08,265
finishing this interview,
I wanted to ask you

1708
01:33:08,266 --> 01:33:10,399
whether you intend
to end on this note,

1709
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,332
or do you think there's
something more to my life

1710
01:33:13,333 --> 01:33:17,800
than my relations
with young women?

1711
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:43,265
He rebuilt his life in France

1712
01:33:43,266 --> 01:33:46,533
with great honor.

1713
01:33:48,734 --> 01:33:51,566
He's a member of
the academie francaise.

1714
01:33:51,567 --> 01:33:55,699
And in France he's desired,

1715
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:57,900
and in America he's wanted.

1716
01:34:35,867 --> 01:34:38,399
Permettez-moi de vous adresser

1717
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,367
un tres chaleureux merci.

1718
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:20,799
And the Oscar...

1719
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,166
Goes to Roman polanski
for "the pianist."

1720
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,799
The academy congratulates
Roman polanski

1721
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:36,133
and accepts this award
on his behalf.

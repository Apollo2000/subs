1
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,232
My name is Temple Grandin.

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,869
I'm not like other people.

3
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,879
I think in pictures and I connect them.

5
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,652
- There she is!
- Temple!

6
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,264
It's hot!

7
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,260
Come on, dear.
You're holding up the other passengers!

8
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,564
I can see the heat!

9
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,844
- Temple!
- Sandy, over here.

10
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,252
Do people live here?

11
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,398
The wolf is growling

12
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,868
and the man with the shotgun
says to Illya Kuryakin,

13
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,698
"Would you like for me to open the gate?"

14
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,108
I'm sorry, Temple, you lost me.

15
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,478
<i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i>
<i>The Gazebo in the Maze.</i>

16
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,879
<i>The wolf is growling</i>

17
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,615
and the man with the shotgun
says to Illya Kuryakin,

18
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,275
"Would you like for me to open the gate?"

19
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,785
"Would you like for me to open the gate?"

20
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,421
You okay?

21
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,232
- Aunt Ann, what is this place?
- Just holding pens.

22
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,034
You don't have those
on the East Coast, huh?

23
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,534
Is this where they slaughter them?

24
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,005
Yes, it is.

25
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:35,076
"Would you like for me to open the gate?"

26
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,312
"Would you like for me to open the gate?"

27
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,112
Yes. Yes, please.

28
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,583
Open the gate, please, Temple.

29
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:48,252
- Would you like for me to open that gate?
- Yes!

30
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:18,989
That's it!

31
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,195
Come on, Temple.

32
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,082
Temple?

33
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,124
Come on, git!

34
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,728
There they are.

35
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,659
Temple made it okay.

36
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,993
- Say hi to your Uncle Mike.
- Hi, Temple.

37
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,432
I just been telling Billy here
all about our summer visitor.

38
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,909
- Are you a cowboy?
- Excuse my niece.

39
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:12,376
That's not how we greet people, Temple.
You know better than that.

40
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,515
Hello, I'm Temple. It's very nice to meet you.

41
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,452
Hello, I'm Temple. It's very nice to meet you.

42
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:19,951
Nice to meet you, too.

43
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,383
Ma'am.

44
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,461
Thanks for this. I'll replace it tomorrow.

45
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,756
Yeah. No rush. I got spares.

46
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,201
Do you get <i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?</i>

47
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,400
Let me show you your room.

48
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,307
These okay here?

49
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,653
And I put all my science fiction books there.

50
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:57,383
- How do I know this is my room?
- Because we say so. It's your room.

51
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:15,563
Okay?

52
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,837
Okay.

53
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,523
So, Temple, you excited about college?
That's something.

54
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,436
- Thank you.
- I can't eat that.

55
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,137
I have colitis. I get it from nervousness.

56
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,606
- I eat pudding and Jell-O.
- I know.

57
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,866
Your mom said.

58
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,350
So you didn't answer Mike's question.
Are you excited about going to college?

59
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,749
I want to stay in high school.
I like my science teacher.

60
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,356
Dr. Carlock's very smart
and he's been to college.

61
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:07,189
So I don't understand why I have to move
to learn what he probably already knows.

62
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,869
The dessert spoons and teaspoons
go in different sections.

63
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,402
I did that.

64
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,877
You know, your uncle can't tell them apart.
And sometimes I can't either.

65
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,775
They're different.

66
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,473
Yes, they are.

67
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:36,349
I think it's time for bed, young lady.
We get up with the rooster around here.

68
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:52,864
- You got everything?
- This is my room.

69
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,640
Yes, it is.

70
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,279
- So, good night.
- I don't want you to do that.

71
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,609
I'm sorry. I forgot. No hugs.

72
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,611
Good night then.

73
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,731
- Hello?
- <i>Did I wake you?</i>

74
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,402
- Of course not.
- Who is it?

75
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,833
It's Ann!

76
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,508
Guess what I found balled up
in the bottom of Temple's closet?

77
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,270
A lovely summer frock she didn't want?

78
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:08,048
It's taken me an age to iron it.
I'll mail it in the morning.

79
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,951
If you couldn't get her to pack it,
I'm not sure I can get her to wear it.

80
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,453
The other one came off
the minute she arrived.

81
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,884
How is she?

82
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:19,053
- She's good.
- Tell me.

83
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,599
She... She got tense
when Mike mentioned college, but...

84
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:29,569
No, but then she calmed down
and she went off to bed just fine.

85
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,739
Stop worrying.
Temple's my job for the summer.

86
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,741
Worry about the others.

87
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,177
I'm sure she's gonna have a great time.

88
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:41,407
You do remember, though,
something's gonna set her off.

89
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,050
Temple?

90
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,953
Temple!

91
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,030
Temple, I could really use a hand here!

92
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,044
So any idea what your major might be?

93
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,339
Science, probably psychology.

94
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,151
You don't have to decide just yet, do you?

95
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:21,021
- It's better than boarding school.
- That's great.

96
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,490
- Lots of choices...
- Danny's looking at you.

97
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,582
See? He can see all around
without moving his head.

98
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,963
- So how do you know where he's looking?
- His ears.

99
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,265
He points his ears where he's looking.

100
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:37,029
See? He's looking at you.
And he's looking at those cowboys.

101
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,875
See? Now I've got his attention.
Now he's looking at me.

102
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,842
You're right. How'd you figure that out?

103
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,478
- There you go!
- What are they doing?

104
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,957
What is this thing?

105
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,561
It holds her still so Billy can inoculate her.

106
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,628
What happened to it? It calmed down.

107
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,724
They just like it. It gentles them.

108
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,547
Stand still and they'll come to you.

109
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:42,020
Won't harm you. Just curious.

110
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,694
Can't help themselves.

111
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,407
Are you worried
about keeping up with the other students?

112
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:31,211
- No. I'm not stupid.
- I didn't say you were.

113
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,508
- Is it moving away from home?
- Hold it straighter.

114
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,441
Why don't you want to go to college?

115
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:41,981
People.

116
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,624
I don't understand people.

117
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:46,659
At least the people at school know
I don't understand them

118
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,956
- and some of them are my friends anyway.
- What don't you understand?

119
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,089
Girls get all goofy over boys.

120
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,937
They talk about silly pop groups
and clothes and say things like,

121
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,006
"Why are you so grumpy?" when I'm happy.

122
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,976
And I say, "I'm happy."
And they say, "Well, you don't look happy."

123
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:06,807
And I say, "Can't you see I'm thinking?
And can't you see I'm sad?"

124
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,408
And I don't know what they're talking about.

125
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,645
What do you look like when you're happy?

126
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,247
Like this.

127
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,757
No. That's not what you looked like

128
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,692
when you were telling me about
<i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i>

129
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,589
You looked like this.

130
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,566
That's funny looking.

131
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,468
Happy. And that's you angry.

132
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,807
Happy. I'm happy in that one.

133
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,310
I'd say more satisfied.

134
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,386
Satisfied.

135
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,082
Maria, can you give me a hand here?

136
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,900
Temple! Temple!

137
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,416
Close it on me.

138
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,096
- Temple, let's get you out of...
- Close it on me!

139
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,688
- Don't be silly!
- Please!

140
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,011
Close the sides. Close the sides.

141
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,673
Please!

142
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,349
Harder! More!

143
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,431
Did you see Temple's handiwork
at the gate?

144
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,795
Isn't that the darndest thing?

145
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:23,759
Hi.

146
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,006
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.

147
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,735
All these years Ann's been bugging me,
like I could ever come up with that!

148
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,716
Is that it?

149
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,788
Is that what Temple's been using?

150
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:46,951
Yes, it is.
I know, it looks horrible, but it helps her.

151
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,498
I'll go find Temple. Temple!

152
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,742
That's mine. That's Temple's.

153
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:06,112
She's had a great summer.
You won't believe the things she's fixed.

154
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,549
- She's wonderful with the cattle.
- Yeah. I... I appreciate that.

155
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,685
I should warn you,
she has her mind set on staying.

156
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,343
That's not an option.

157
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,050
Ann.

158
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,797
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to attack you,

159
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,266
especially when you've been
so generous all summer.

160
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,527
Temple? Temple?

161
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,799
Temple.

162
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,203
Temple!

163
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,519
How was your trip, Mother?
You made good time.

164
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:01,830
It was long. Thank you for asking.

165
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,533
You ready for college?

166
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,938
I think I'd rather stay here.

167
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,011
We've talked about this.

168
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,848
Sweetheart, you're gonna be fine.

169
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,111
No one expected it.
It's nothing short of a miracle.

170
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,515
It's a miracle!

171
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,636
Temple, this way.

172
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,746
- Can I get that for you?
- Thank you.

173
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,283
224. This is you.

174
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,529
- I don't have a roommate.
- No, no, no.

175
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,999
Your roommate is coming
in another couple of weeks.

176
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,361
Remember?

177
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,437
Everyone else has a roommate!

178
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:49,304
Well, then, why don't you just think of it
as a chance to settle in, sweetheart?

179
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,078
- Think I'll go back home!
- Temple.

180
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:55,548
I know that this is strange and new,

181
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,551
- but you're going to be all right.
- I don't want to stay here!

182
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,642
Try and stay calm.

183
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,557
It's all right. Try and calm down, all right?

184
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,455
I'm going to give you a moment to yourself.

185
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,174
- What's wrong?
- Is she all right?

186
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,868
Interested in playing with other children?

187
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,036
No, not really.

188
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,546
Plays with toys, dolls?

189
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,876
She loves to rip things.

190
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,818
And no speech yet at the age of...

191
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,421
Four. She's four.

192
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,786
No, not yet.

193
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:49,360
- I'm sure it's just a phase, but...
- Your child is clearly autistic.

194
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,534
- Autistic. I'm... I'm not familiar...
- She's an infantile schizophrenic.

195
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,411
Infantile... So...

196
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:06,886
So when would she grow out of it?
I mean, what's the next step for...

197
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:09,789
We generally recommend an institution.

198
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,459
For how long?
I'm not sure I would like that. I really...

199
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,695
I... I wouldn't want to miss her first words.

200
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,059
She probably will never speak.

201
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,901
And I'm afraid
there is no course of treatment.

202
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,868
I'm talking about institutionalization.

203
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,201
But...

204
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:36,048
I mean, she... She was a perfectly normal
baby and then later she changed.

205
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,345
So I need to know how, why.

206
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:44,023
I'm not sure you'd...
Perhaps if you had your husband call me.

207
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,993
My husband is a very busy man
and I graduated from Harvard,

208
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,688
- so why don't you try me?
- I'm sorry.

209
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:57,861
It's been suggested that it may be
a lack of bonding with the mother,

210
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:03,142
that at a crucial phase,
the mother was cold, aloof,

211
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,710
when the child most needed
physical affection.

212
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,446
But that is not what happened.

213
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,749
We have another child
and she is not like this,

214
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,451
and I did not do anything different.

215
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:16,681
Temple rejects me. I...
I want to hug her and she won't let me.

216
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,925
I'm supposed to have done this.
Well, then, I can undo it.

217
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,528
- You just tell me what to do.
- As I said,

218
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:28,328
I recommend institutionalization.
Here's a list of facilities that we recommend.

219
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,101
Dog.

220
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,906
Dog.

221
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:36,270
Temple. Dog.

222
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:45,214
Temple. Cat.

223
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:48,547
Cat. Temple, try.

224
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,618
Mommy.

225
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:57,487
Mommy.

226
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,759
I know you can hear me.

227
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:10,500
All right.
I think Mommy needs a five-minute break.

228
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,459
Okay?

229
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,796
Okay.

230
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,717
No. I don't want to study French.
I want to learn science.

231
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,453
Read the page, please.

232
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,997
Read it.

233
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,775
And what did it say?

234
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,149
You...

235
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:33,515
You learned it?

236
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,189
I just looked at it.

237
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:39,398
Then I have the page in my mind
and can read off the page.

238
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,898
I see pictures and connect them.

239
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,581
Hey, save me a seat!

240
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,089
Let me see. Come out here.

241
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,153
- John, I got one for you.
- Coming through.

242
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,521
Watch out!

243
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,306
I only eat Jell-O and yogurt!

244
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,874
I only... I only eat Jell-O and yogurt!

245
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:40,820
You see her?

246
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,619
Excuse me?

247
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,719
I'm your roommate.

248
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,956
What are you doing?

249
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,830
It's a machine I just made.

250
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,730
It feels like a hug. Do you want a hug?
It feels really good.

251
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:07,169
So when you got in your machine,
did it make you feel like a cow?

252
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,047
No, I didn't feel like a cow.

253
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,876
But it gave you pleasure.

254
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,350
It made me feel good, gentle.

255
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,024
- The hug made you feel good.
- Yes.

256
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:24,957
- But you don't like to be touched by people.
- No.

257
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,164
Do you like to touch yourself?

258
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,105
Touching myself's okay.

259
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,543
But when the squeeze machine
touches you,

260
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,235
- it feels better?
- Yes.

261
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,077
It gives you release?

262
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,685
Yes, there is release.

263
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,427
- But I need it!
- Let's take it down.

264
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,553
- I built it! It's mine!
- What's all the noise?

265
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:01,155
- Wait! Stop it!
- Pervert.

266
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,800
- Got it? Okay.
- Yeah, I got it.

267
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:28,861
Twenty three hours, 59 minutes

268
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:34,422
and four, three, two, one.
Zero hour, Mr. Solo!

269
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,985
Hey! What are you doing?

270
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:06,026
Stop! I said stop!

271
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,400
She says she's not going back
after spring break

272
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,263
unless she can take it with her.

273
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,340
- Are you still there?
- Yes.

274
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,076
And I really don't think it's a good idea.

275
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,878
It works for her.

276
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:55,681
It's everything
we've been struggling to get away from.

277
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:59,239
They were perfectly clear.
No devices in her room.

278
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:03,178
Could there be a better way to mark her
as a weirdo and an oddball?

279
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,457
Just let us try, okay?

280
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:10,989
So that's it.

281
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:15,998
Okay!

282
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,388
<i>It makes me gentle.</i>

283
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,524
<i>She's a different person</i>
<i>after just</i> 15 <i>minutes.</i>

284
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:41,226
A different person?
How can you explain that?

285
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:45,023
I can't explain why the machine works,
but I know it's not sexual.

286
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,598
As Temple says, it calms her.

287
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,300
Look, all this does is to convince me

288
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,536
that we're not equipped
to deal with Ms. Grandin's needs.

289
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,237
It makes her a better student.

290
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,339
She's able to concentrate,
to interact with others more easily...

291
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,174
This isn't very scientific.

292
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,044
- There is no empirical evidence...
- I can do an experiment.

293
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,779
I can...
I can see how it works on other people.

294
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,542
I can measure heart rates.
I think it'll work on everyone.

295
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,150
Let's talk frankly.

296
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,291
I'm not sure you can get anything
from being at Franklin Pierce.

297
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:15,627
Listen to what she's saying. She wants to
do her own science experiment,

298
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,896
something you can evaluate
in her psychology course.

299
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,294
I have a pen and a clipboard.

300
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:30,166
Time.

301
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:34,004
Do you feel, A, claustrophobic,

302
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:36,410
B, constricted,

303
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,547
C, no different,

304
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,781
D, comfortable,

305
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,647
E, relaxed?

306
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:46,686
- What was the one before last?
- D, comfortable.

307
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,088
- Yes, I'm quite comfortable.
- Okay.

308
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,263
C, no different.

309
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:59,100
A, claustrophobic!

310
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,132
I guess I feel relaxed.

311
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,369
Very relaxed.

312
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,311
Oh, my God.

313
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,984
"F" for "Freak."

314
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,588
Hello? Hampshire Country School?
I need to speak to Dr. Carlock!

315
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:52,555
<i>Dr. Carlock? Yes. Please hold.</i>

316
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,196
- You're doing great.
- I'm going.

317
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,966
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy.

318
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:21,253
- You're such a good boy.
- Please, here, take this.

319
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,412
I'll take these. Welcome.

320
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,623
Excuse the mess.
We just had a staff meeting.

321
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,653
Good. They're here.

322
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,352
Temple Grandin,
I would like you to meet Mr. Hodges.

323
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,994
He is our mathematics teacher.

324
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,368
Temple, come here.

325
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,969
Hello, I'm Temple. It's very nice to meet you.

326
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:40,972
This is <i>Mademoiselle</i> Davide.
She is our French teacher.

327
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,370
Hello, I'm Temple, very nice to meet you.

328
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,667
Hi, I'm Dr. Carlock. I teach science.

329
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,576
- Are you a scientist?
- Temple.

330
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,213
Hello, I'm Temple, it's very nice to meet you.
Are you a scientist?

331
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,253
I used to work for NASA.

332
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,460
Temple's very interested in science.

333
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,528
I'd like to meet Belka and Strelka.

334
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,597
They're the first dogs
to come back from space alive.

335
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:06,665
That's right.

336
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:09,063
- In <i>Sputnik</i> 5, August 20th, 1960.
- <i>Sputnik</i> 5, August 20th, 1960.

337
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:18,099
We're changing schools mid-term
because Temple's been expelled.

338
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,642
I'm sorry, why was she expelled, again?

339
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,239
Hitting another child with a book.

340
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,985
There's no excuse,
but I will say this in her defense.

341
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,856
I have never seen her strike
unless she's been provoked.

342
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:35,689
And other children have taunted
and bullied her constantly.

343
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:40,031
<i>They make fun of her because</i>
<i>she doesn't understand their jokes.</i>

344
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,067
<i>She spins to comfort herself.</i>

345
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:46,805
<i>She talks fast, often too fast,</i>
<i>and she talks repetitively,</i>

346
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,772
<i>and then the children called her</i>
<i>a tape recorder.</i>

347
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:54,045
Then she'll go into a panic attack,
and then they make fun of that, too.

348
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:58,411
Excuse me.
When was she diagnosed autistic?

349
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:02,876
She was four,
but I sometimes wonder if that's correct.

350
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,157
Why do you say that?

351
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:07,748
You've seen her, she's bright.

352
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,364
We have a lot of experience with children
with special needs,

353
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:15,934
and emotional problems,
neuro-behavioral issues

354
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:18,559
that we've made a number...

355
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:20,872
- I think that because of...
- I'm so sorry.

356
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:24,601
I really have wasted your time.
I just can't do this to her.

357
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,440
Mrs. Grandin. Mrs. Grandin. Mrs. Grandin!

358
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:32,672
Mrs. Grandin, please! Can I speak with you
for a moment, please?

359
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,691
Mrs. Grandin, you don't strike me as the
sort of person who would abuse their child

360
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,960
or deny them love and care...

361
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,997
I... Now, you wait.
I have done everything that I can for Temple

362
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:51,236
and if it isn't good enough,
then it just isn't good enough.

363
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:55,006
But you cannot even begin
to imagine the chaos,

364
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,877
the upheavals, the tantrums and the pain.

365
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,278
Her pain.

366
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:04,316
You seem to be acting
as if you have done something wrong,

367
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,510
when it's obvious
you've done everything right.

368
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,820
I think she's terrific.

369
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,893
I know it's difficult when, as parents,
we want our children

370
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:17,529
to be everything we hoped for them to be

371
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,032
and, if they're not,
we think it's our fault and...

372
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,301
And that there's never ever anybody
out there who understands

373
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:27,269
what we're going through.
It makes you feel alone, right?

374
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,143
Mrs. Grandin,
I'm not an admissions person.

375
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,404
I just teach science,

376
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:38,516
but I feel that this school
might be the right place for your daughter.

377
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,607
I'd love to have her here.

378
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:48,718
The doctors wanted me
to institutionalize her and...

379
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,731
I don't know.
Just dumping her at a boarding school,

380
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,667
it just feels like another way to give her up.

381
00:38:55,767 --> 00:39:00,397
But it's... It's not. It's just the first step
in getting her out into the world.

382
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,244
And I know you saw the children
making fun of her

383
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,747
- and you want to protect her.
- Yeah, of course I do.

384
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,515
Yeah, what parent doesn't want to?

385
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:15,153
But at some point,
she's going to hit life head on.

386
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:19,917
And trust me, we know how different she is.

387
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,691
Different, not less.

388
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,291
Different, but not less.

389
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,906
You watch. You'll...

390
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,169
You'll make friends
and you're gonna ride horses.

391
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,578
- Okay?
- Okay.

392
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,446
Okay.

393
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,234
What are you doing in with Chestnut?
No one is to go near that horse!

394
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,638
Can he be my horse?
He likes being hugged.

395
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,273
I want to ride him.

396
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,967
You'll ride. Just not Chestnut.

397
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,184
Why are there so many fish in France?

398
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,749
French fish! French fish!

399
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:04,913
Excellent work, Temple.
Really excellent work.

400
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,922
- French fish!
- French fish!

401
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:13,217
- French fish!
- French fish!

402
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,161
Hey! What happened here?

403
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,696
- She hit him for no reason!
- Temple.

404
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,195
Come on, let's go.

405
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:24,395
- And he's done it before!
- Stop. Stop. Temple, stop.

406
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:29,963
Temple, Tim will be punished
for what he did, but you cannot hit people.

407
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,138
You understand that?

408
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:37,382
Good. And to really get that through to you,
you will not ride for two weeks.

409
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:40,542
- But that's not fair!
- Two weeks.

410
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:56,932
No, no. There's... There's nothing there.

411
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,634
And he's been like this for three hours?

412
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,133
I don't think there's anything
anybody could have done.

413
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,413
I'll send the boy around with the truck.
Can you do it?

414
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:10,140
I'll take care of it, Dad.

415
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:32,631
Temple?

416
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,377
Where do they go?

417
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:48,517
I don't know.

418
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:52,921
Heaven, maybe. Somewhere.

419
00:44:56,494 --> 00:45:01,193
Temple, when animals and people die,

420
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:04,463
they stay with us in our minds.

421
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:06,504
We can still see them.

422
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:10,165
So I think it would be best
not to remember Chestnut like this.

423
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:11,868
Okay?

424
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:16,807
I see Chestnut the day I arrived.
I see grooming Chestnut.

425
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,516
I see a picture of a horse
just like Chestnut in a book.

426
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,553
We passed a Chestnut horse
on route 119 near a feed store.

427
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,723
<i>There was one on a calendar at Aunt Ann's,</i>
<i>there was one in</i> Life <i>magazine</i>

428
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,917
- opposite the page of Mr. Kennedy...
- Okay. Okay.

429
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:32,555
Can you bring everything you've seen
to your mind?

430
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:34,932
Sure.

431
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:39,332
Even if it were an everyday object,
like, say, shoes?

432
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,641
I see all the shoes I've worn,
my mother's and other people I've met.

433
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,144
And you have three pairs,
one needs a new heel.

434
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:49,338
And I see the newspaper ads
and TV ads and...

435
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:52,713
Can't you?

436
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,120
- This girl has an amazing mind.
- Try teaching her math.

437
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,156
- Her algebra's hopeless.
- Or French.

438
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,623
- "Why are there so many fish in France?"
- I want to show you something.

439
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,252
She thinks in pictures.

440
00:46:04,796 --> 00:46:08,199
That's why she does so well when she can
see the things that are being discussed.

441
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:10,358
Like biology.

442
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:14,102
Or... Or shop.

443
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:18,343
Those are concrete things.
But language or algebra?

444
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,934
- It's just gibberish to her.
- What's that?

445
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,807
Do you want to see your "French fish"?

446
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,777
"The eels ate."

447
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:30,418
"Eel ate."

448
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:36,617
French is full of "Eels."
And this is what she sees.

449
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,428
She's an amazing visual thinker.

450
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:47,935
- Let me work with her.
- Fine.

451
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:54,337
We have five minutes left.
Who wants to see a movie?

452
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,245
- Yeah!
- All right.

453
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:04,144
- J.D., will you do the projector?
- Okay.

454
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:09,327
All right.
Now everybody watch very carefully

455
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:13,386
because this one
is all about optical illusions.

456
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:18,202
<i>It comes as a distinct shock to most people</i>
<i>when they realize how limited</i>

457
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,362
<i>and how inaccurate</i>
<i>the human senses really are.</i>

458
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:26,110
<i>In this house, faces at the window seem to</i>
<i>come in assorted sizes, don't they?</i>

459
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,804
That looks like Mr. Povey, doesn't it?

460
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,609
<i>But there's nothing wrong with the faces.</i>
<i>It's those windows</i>

461
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,951
<i>and what they're doing to your brain.</i>

462
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,518
All right, here we go.

463
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,845
<i>A small one and a tall one.</i>

464
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:44,359
<i>Let's see if we can even things out a bit.</i>

465
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,334
- How do they do that?
- Sit down!

466
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,369
All right, please.
Temple, sit down, please. J.D.

467
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,666
That is the question, isn't it?
"How did they do that?"

468
00:47:57,308 --> 00:48:01,244
Well, that's this week's assignment.
I want one page, at least.

469
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,243
- A full page?
- All right, two?

470
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:05,974
- No, no, no, no.
- All right, one page. Okay.

471
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:09,848
- They mess with the perspective!
- That's right, Temple.

472
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:12,390
And it was a room built
with distorted perspective.

473
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:15,323
- But how?
- Well, do you think you could figure it out?

474
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,853
Maybe if you visualized it?

475
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,593
And if you build one,
I'll give you extra credit.

476
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:24,533
Yeah, okay.

477
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:36,641
Hey!

478
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,010
Weirdo!

479
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:45,945
Does she have to chalk the walls?

480
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,219
Look at her.

481
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,196
- I can't do it!
- I think you can, Temple.

482
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,197
But I can't!
I know, I know. I shouldn't shout.

483
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:31,027
But measuring perspective didn't work!

484
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,351
Hey, Leigh,
these are the specifications you need.

485
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:02,466
Success, Temple?

486
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,558
No! Give me a clue, please!

487
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:09,874
You have to think
of all the features in the room,

488
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:13,878
the walls, the floors,
the ceilings, the doors.

489
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:15,172
Got it!

490
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:24,048
You've already gone through this, right?
You saw...

491
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:26,257
Well, you can tell that that's
how she painted it.

492
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,126
This is what she was working on
the other day.

493
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:32,718
I want to go through this.
It's a strange optical illusion.

494
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,464
Well, as you can see,

495
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,095
the horses are the exact same size.

496
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,307
And here is the room.

497
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,017
Temple, congratulations.

498
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:58,079
I think this deserves a round of applause.

499
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:05,029
I think it deserves a celebration.

500
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:06,858
Yeah!

501
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:13,402
Five, four, three, two, one.

502
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:37,658
Now, here's a question.

503
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:41,732
If I wind this up and then let go,

504
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:45,700
why doesn't the propeller stay still
and the body of the plane spin around?

505
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,339
That's simple. The resistance of the wings.

506
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,930
- That's absolutely right.
- And watch this.

507
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,045
With no wings

508
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,413
and just one plane of resistance,

509
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:12,651
- you have a helicopter!
- You're absolutely right.

510
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:18,426
Temple. You have a very special mind,
you know that?

511
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,832
You see the world in ways that others can't,

512
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:24,475
and that's quite an advantage.

513
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:29,213
And you know something? If you weren't
such a goof and you developed this talent,

514
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,781
you could easily go on to college.

515
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,951
What would I do at college?

516
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:37,782
Well, with your mind,
anything you wanted to. Pick a subject.

517
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:44,662
Cows. Do they have colleges with cows?

518
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:48,289
Yes, they do. And horses and pigs
and goats and sheep and...

519
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:51,128
Yeah, it's called animal husbandry.

520
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:59,442
- Animal husbandry.
- Yeah, and it deals with the care of animals.

521
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:05,007
Really, anything you wanted.
You could study people, psychology.

522
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,585
I'd get to understand people?

523
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,448
Well, that's the idea.

524
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,148
I'll stay here.

525
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:19,225
Temple, think of it as a door.

526
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:25,402
A door that's going to open up
onto a whole new world for you

527
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,869
and all you need to do
is decide to go through it.

528
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:51,929
- Miss Grandin?
- First off,

529
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:54,698
I talked to my old teacher Dr. Carlock.
And he said I should stress

530
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,434
that it wasn't that I hadn't done the work,
because I had,

531
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,103
but I'd collected way too much data

532
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,405
and backed it up
with far too many citations,

533
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:04,542
that I needed extra time
just to make it coherent.

534
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:07,411
But if you look at these results,
you'll see that it's not just me, but in fact,

535
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:10,514
a majority of people who become calmer
when using my machine.

536
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,784
And that really makes
a clear case for me keeping it.

537
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,786
And I should get a good grade.

538
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:18,446
- Did your...
- Certainly more than a pass.

539
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:22,293
Did your previous teacher, Dr. Carlock,
suggest the good grade?

540
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:23,917
No, that's me.

541
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:26,323
Leave it with me.

542
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:30,659
This is very important work!

543
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:46,250
You used a control group?

544
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:50,787
They were tested resting, seated,
and most of them got bored. Page four.

545
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,956
This is excellent.
And I think it will be a good grade.

546
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,764
So I keep my machine.

547
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,065
In that case, I'll stay.

548
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:10,608
I would imagine your new roommate

549
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:13,871
will want a say
in whether you keep the machine.

550
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:26,257
That's my squeeze machine.

551
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,450
- Do I have to move it?
- No.

552
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:33,289
But don't ever move it
and then I'll always know where it is.

553
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,423
Okay.

554
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:39,436
It's almost time for <i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i>

555
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,372
They play it in the rec room.

556
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:44,270
Do you want to watch
<i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?</i>

557
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,945
You can't watch <i>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</i>

558
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:50,479
I do. I'd love to watch it.

559
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:53,742
- Will you show me where it is?
- Yeah, sure.

560
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:21,208
Now Illya Kuryakin's trying
to open the door, but it's locked.

561
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,144
And now the floor's sliding under the room.

562
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:29,311
There's a big drop to lots of spikes!

563
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,586
That's the other kids in the room hissing.

564
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:36,920
- Do you like <i>Star Trek,</i> too?
- Yes.

565
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,523
- Who's your favorite?
- Mr. Spock.

566
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:43,566
We have a lot in common.

567
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:45,632
Maybe we can watch it on the radio.

568
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:48,763
- They broadcast it for the blind.
- They do?

569
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,633
Let's watch it on the radio.

570
00:56:54,845 --> 00:56:56,574
You're quieter now.

571
00:56:57,815 --> 00:57:00,716
Is that because
you're in your squeeze machine?

572
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,280
I was just getting out.

573
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:11,153
- Is my voice that different?
- It is to me.

574
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:14,426
Remember, I see you through your voice.

575
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:17,501
Do you remember a lot of voices?

576
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:21,662
Of course.
But I remember the sounds of places, too.

577
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:28,738
We're the same, only you have sounds
and I have pictures.

578
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,010
I'm off to class.

579
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:40,619
I have French class. I hate it.
That's why I'm in my squeeze machine.

580
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:43,754
Your squeeze machine doesn't bother me.

581
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,993
- Okay?
- I know. Okay.

582
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,967
Good luck.

583
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,701
Thank you.

584
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:14,614
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

585
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:17,318
No.

586
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:27,232
<i>I've always wanted to understand</i>
<i>the gentleness that other people feel</i>

587
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,897
<i>by being hugged by their mothers.</i>

588
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:33,334
<i>And now I've made a machine</i>
<i>that lets me do that.</i>

589
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:36,374
<i>It feels like a wire gets reconnected.</i>

590
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:38,942
<i>Like something gets repaired.</i>

591
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:45,222
If it wasn't for my machine,
I wouldn't be standing here today.

592
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:49,359
Instead I'd be hiding in my room
or spinning in circles to calm myself,

593
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,188
or hitting someone.

594
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:56,233
When I was younger,
I closed myself off from people.

595
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,131
I didn't even speak until I was four.

596
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:03,098
There's a highfalutin name
for this condition. Autism.

597
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,816
But because of my machine,

598
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:16,220
I'm able to know the kindness and love
that have been given to me

599
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,652
to reach this point in my life.

600
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:22,493
Today more than ever,
I realize I have not walked alone.

601
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:26,757
And I thank not only my teachers,
but my friends and family as well.

602
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:30,129
As in the words of the song from <i>Carousel.</i>

603
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:38,573
<i>When you walk through a storm</i>
<i>Hold your head up high</i>

604
00:59:38,842 --> 00:59:43,881
<i>And don't be afraid of the dark</i>

605
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:50,011
<i>At the end of a storm is a golden sky</i>

606
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:55,953
<i>And a sweet silver song of a lark</i>

607
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:02,324
<i>Walk on through the wind</i>
<i>Walk on through the rain</i>

608
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:07,798
<i>Though your dreams be tossed and blown</i>

609
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:11,369
<i>Walk on, walk on</i>

610
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,877
<i>With hope in your heart</i>

611
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:18,641
<i>And you'll never walk alone</i>

612
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:25,010
<i>You'll never walk alone</i>

613
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,193
This is my door.

614
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:49,596
It opens to another world.

615
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,874
Arizona State students, gather around.

616
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:26,408
All right. Come on, everybody.
Come on down this way.

617
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:30,380
Here we go. All right, come on in.
Here we go. Here we go.

618
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,675
Everybody, come on. Let's go.

619
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,219
All right, come on in closer now.
Gather around so you can hear.

620
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,821
All right, class, listen up.

621
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:40,557
This is Don Michaels. He runs the feedlot.

622
01:02:40,657 --> 01:02:42,259
Thanks, Professor.

623
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:46,728
All right, what we got here at any one time
is about 50, 52,000 head of cattle.

624
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:49,865
Now, they gotta weigh 650 pounds
to get in here.

625
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,202
During the three or four months
they spend here, they'll put on

626
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:55,939
another 400 pounds before they
move into the big house for slaughtering.

627
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:58,709
Well, while they're here fattening up,
we got to keep them healthy.

628
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:01,511
So one of the first things we do
when they come in off the range

629
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,603
is put them through a dip,
get rid of any bugs.

630
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:08,813
- Excuse me there, buddy. You okay?
- That's a girl.

631
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,719
Miss Grandin.

632
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,090
Miss, are you with us, here?

633
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,216
- I was listening to the cattle.
- Oh, yeah?

634
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:21,064
Why are some mooing more loudly than
others? I never heard so much mooing!

635
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:24,031
Honey, I've been around
cattle all my working life.

636
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:27,297
About all I can tell you is that,
just like the female of the species,

637
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:30,635
cattle love to yammer and gossip or sulk.

638
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,744
It's always just one thing or the other.

639
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:35,545
- But like I was saying...
- Well, there must be a reason.

640
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,340
They're saying something.

641
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:42,741
Well, I reckon you could get Dr. Dolittle
on out here. He probably could tell you.

642
01:03:42,853 --> 01:03:45,922
While missy here is listening to what
the cattle are saying to each other,

643
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:49,185
why don't you boys step over here
with me and see a dip in action?

644
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,005
Now, the biggest problem
you got with a dip vat

645
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:05,575
is that cattle can swim all right
unless they tip on over.

646
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,577
Then them babies'll drown real fast on you

647
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,646
unless you get a hold of them
and haul them out.

648
01:04:19,623 --> 01:04:21,284
Get up there. Go!

649
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:28,620
Well, there you go!
See, this is what I was telling you.

650
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:29,921
Jesus!

651
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:37,339
Come on, boys. Earn your money!

652
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,670
Hold them up over there! Hold them up!

653
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:45,840
Come on, boys. We're gonna lose that baby.

654
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:51,150
Roy! Roy, get a rope on this heifer
and drag it out!

655
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:06,102
Okay. Okay.

656
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:09,372
Well, there you go. You'll see inside.
It'll take more than that to kill a cow.

657
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:12,134
- Get up! Get up!
- Do you lose many?

658
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:15,145
Well, we got to run 300 of them
through here in an hour.

659
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:19,545
I guess in a week, we'll lose
one or two maybe. We're doing pretty good.

660
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:33,928
Dolittle, how you holding up?
Too much for you?

661
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:36,961
They like to walk in circles.

662
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:40,971
Well, what do you know, boys?
Cattle like to walk in circles!

663
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:43,232
Dang, give that girl a prize.

664
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:47,509
It calms them down. They walk
in circles away from the handlers.

665
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:51,447
Maybe you ought to wait out here
when we go inside.

666
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:00,683
Go!

667
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:12,226
Then when we have it in the cage,
it just takes one knock to the head.

668
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:25,337
So, Dolittle, what do you think?

669
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:32,054
- Where does it go?
- Meat processing.

670
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,688
No, where does it go?

671
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,526
It was here, and now it's meat.

672
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,190
Where did it go?

673
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:47,062
Professor, I think maybe your young lady
here ought to consider another line of work.

674
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:32,515
Mooing? You want to do research
and write your master's on mooing?

675
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:35,552
Curves. Cattle like curves.
They don't moo at curves.

676
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:37,520
Miss Grandin, when we accepted you,

677
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,790
we were impressed you had excelled
at your previous school.

678
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,628
A master's thesis on mooing
strikes me as a lowering of the bar

679
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:46,496
and I, for one, will not be the first person

680
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:49,366
to give you an easy ride
because of your autism.

681
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:51,501
- Come up with something...
- Cattle are prey animals.

682
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,738
My autism allows me
to understand prey animals well.

683
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:57,739
I can visualize the flight zones of cattle.

684
01:07:57,974 --> 01:07:59,743
A handler outside the flight zone

685
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:02,545
can keep an animal circling
in a calm and orderly manner.

686
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,482
But stepping into the flight zone
panics the cattle,

687
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:08,813
and they change from soft moos
to loud mooing.

688
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,655
Like, prey animals don't make noises
that will draw attention to them

689
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:13,857
unless they're trying to warn
other members of the herd.

690
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:16,192
So they're warning each other
they're going to be slaughtered?

691
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,661
No. No. No, sir.

692
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:20,296
The loud mooing is the same
whether they're gonna be dipped,

693
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:22,699
driven around a hard corner
or taken to slaughter.

694
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,701
I mean, they have no idea
what's gonna happen to them...

695
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:26,803
- I'm glad we agree on that.
...but they're spooked.

696
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:29,269
And spooked cattle don't act straight.

697
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:34,541
They get bruised, scraped, drowned,
and that all costs money.

698
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:38,340
And it takes a good half hour to calm
a herd and that costs money, too.

699
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:40,684
It's not a good way to run a stockyard.

700
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:44,777
Well, I believe what's good for cattle
is also good for business.

701
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:52,555
Well, get the yard to sign off on it.

702
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,565
- You mean Don.
- That's who's in charge.

703
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,274
Sorry, ma'am. No women on the lot.

704
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,079
My name is Temple Grandin.
I'm a grad student at Arizona State...

705
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:11,170
That's the rules, ma'am.

706
01:09:12,215 --> 01:09:14,250
I'm a grad student at Arizona State
and I was here last week.

707
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:18,116
Complaints from cowboys' wives.
They just don't want no women on the yard.

708
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:20,048
I'm just doing my job.

709
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,496
Ma'am, you're holding up the line.

710
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:30,054
You're going to have to turn around
and take it on off the lot. If you please.

711
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,468
Don't come back.

712
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,210
John Richmond, press,
<i>Ranchman</i> magazine.

713
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,572
Go on in.

714
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:51,785
<i>It's a door.</i>

715
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,417
<i>It's another door.</i>

716
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,568
Thanks, ma'am. Take care.

717
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,536
- Good morning.
- Go on in.

718
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:56,485
- Morning.
- Go on in.

719
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:04,957
- Hi, Sanch.
- Hey. Hey, there.

720
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,231
Good to have you back, son. Seems like
a long time since you worked out here.

721
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:09,465
Yeah, it does.

722
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:11,467
- What is this, a Purple Heart?
- Yeah, it is.

723
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,236
We're real proud of you.

724
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:15,872
Gee, Sanch, you didn't get all these
just digging latrines.

725
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:18,007
- No, sir. I was in Khe Sanh.
- Good for you.

726
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,940
Excuse me, sir. I need you to sign off
on my master's thesis.

727
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:23,672
- How'd you get in here?
- They just waved me in.

728
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,916
- What are you gonna research?
- Agitation in cattle.

729
01:11:28,518 --> 01:11:32,284
Would that be mooing?
You believe that crap?

730
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,958
Since cattle are prey animals,
loud mooing is a sign of...

731
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:36,582
No way.

732
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,562
Come on, Sanch, let's get some coffee.

733
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:41,798
Say, did you bring back
one of them little China gals with you?

734
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:44,992
No, they wouldn't let me bring back one
on the airplane none.

735
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,971
You girls got the coffee ready in here?

736
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:50,505
- We got a man that's thirsty.
- Come on in!

737
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:18,758
Do you have another entrance?

738
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:23,305
- Pardon?
- Do you have another entrance?

739
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:25,631
No, ma'am.

740
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:40,356
Do you have any Jell-O or yogurt?

741
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:43,186
In the cooler. Right behind you, darling.

742
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,294
<i>By eating the weaker and slower ones,</i>

743
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:22,632
<i>lions keep the antelope population strong</i>
<i>and in proper proportion</i>

744
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,461
<i>to all other animals.</i>

745
01:13:48,825 --> 01:13:51,293
Light. Shadow.

746
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,970
Reflections on puddle.

747
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:51,421
I've eaten bulls' testicles!

748
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:54,649
Ate them in my aunt's ranch. Regularly!

749
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,253
This is a waste!

750
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,976
Hey!

751
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,822
You gotta remember to drink out here.

752
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,959
Well, I have data on things
that make them balk, like shadows,

753
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:05,461
reflections on water,
a chain glinting in the sun.

754
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,263
- Is that right?
- They won't walk into shaded areas.

755
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:08,531
They need to see where they're going.

756
01:16:08,631 --> 01:16:12,468
I've lots of important information on all this
and I need Mr. Michaels to sign off on it.

757
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,537
Don? Don don't sign nothing.

758
01:16:14,637 --> 01:16:17,140
- I need Mr. Michaels to sign...
- You're not hearing me right.

759
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,174
Don don't sign nothing.

760
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:21,470
I sign everything around here.

761
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:26,580
His signature, but I do the signing.

762
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,782
I'm not even sure if Don can write.

763
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:36,092
Say, if you're interested in cattle
and how cattle act,

764
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:38,628
you shouldn't just hang around feedlots.

765
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:43,665
You should be out on ranches,
auctions, rodeos, that sort of thing.

766
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,240
Got the big steer here. 1,000 pounds.

767
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:55,878
Let's see what she got here. 20, 25,
25, 25 and a half. 25 and a half, 75.

768
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,880
- Twenty five, 75, 25...
- He looks mean.

769
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:02,110
Twenty five. 75, 30, 30, 30, 30.
Sold him. Pat 17.

770
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:05,288
Lookit, here's mama here.

771
01:17:05,388 --> 01:17:07,890
Now, 75. 25, 25, 25.

772
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:11,294
25, 27 and a half. He's 27 and a half.
30, 32 and a half, 35.

773
01:17:11,394 --> 01:17:13,362
Sold him. Pat 21. Pat 21.

774
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:18,660
The <i>Arizona Ranchman.</i>
We got real estate. We got...

775
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,948
Yeah, it's a good magazine.
I'd like you to take a look at it.

776
01:17:32,048 --> 01:17:34,573
Help you out with
all kinds of cattle questions.

777
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,356
See you back here
in about five minutes, okay?

778
01:17:40,456 --> 01:17:41,548
Excuse...

779
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:48,559
It's all doors to new worlds.

780
01:17:57,573 --> 01:18:01,010
Excuse me, sir? Sir?
I'm very pleased to meet you.

781
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:03,446
I'm Temple Grandin, a Bachelor of Science,

782
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:05,348
doing my master's here at Arizona State,

783
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:07,348
currently studying
in Scottsdale Feed Yards,

784
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:10,920
and I was wondering if I could interest
the <i>Arizona Farmer-Ranchman</i> periodical

785
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,656
on a thesis I'm writing
on control systems and cattle

786
01:18:13,756 --> 01:18:17,556
and why some work better than others
and how they can tell the difference.

787
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:21,827
How'd you get on with old Don Michaels
over at Scottsdale?

788
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:25,361
I told him I've eaten bull testicles, sir.

789
01:18:27,303 --> 01:18:29,538
Well, I will read anything you send in,
Miss Grandin.

790
01:18:29,638 --> 01:18:34,598
In fact, here, take my card.
You address it directly to me.

791
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:38,774
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

792
01:18:42,518 --> 01:18:43,746
It's open.

793
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,524
Sir, Scottsdale Feedlot signed off
on my cattle agitation study.

794
01:18:48,624 --> 01:18:51,320
Smells like half the herd signed it first.

795
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:55,598
- No, sir. Cattle can't do that.
- And I don't need the magazine.

796
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:56,999
I'm a subscriber.

797
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:59,435
Well, I just wanted to make sure
you saw my article

798
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:02,104
on mooing as a guide to cattle agitation.

799
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:04,774
Full thesis is still at the typist,
but you should have it by Friday.

800
01:19:04,874 --> 01:19:05,966
Temple?

801
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:13,380
- Let's go sing near the fire.
- No, Ralf.

802
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:16,552
Merry Christmas!

803
01:19:16,652 --> 01:19:17,846
Temple!

804
01:19:18,187 --> 01:19:20,849
Well, Master of Science.

805
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:24,815
- Master of Science in Animal Science.
- Fantastic.

806
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,896
I'll bet you're glad to be back East.

807
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:31,033
- I like the West.
- So do I, but it isn't home, is it?

808
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,868
What will you do with your master's?

809
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:34,737
Your mother mentioned teaching maybe.

810
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:36,939
Great new school over West Medford way.

811
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:39,475
I have a lot more research
to do and things to write. So...

812
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:41,510
That's right, you've been published.

813
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,339
You remember Scott?

814
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,814
- Scott?
- Scott?

815
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:46,215
Scotty, over here.

816
01:19:46,315 --> 01:19:47,883
- I'll be right back.
- He's our oldest boy.

817
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:50,816
<i>New York Magazine's</i> taken a piece of his.

818
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:53,016
You remember Scott?

819
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:54,757
He used to spit in my Jell-O.

820
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:59,885
I'm sure he didn't.
Temple, tell Scott about your writing.

821
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:04,827
I published two articles
in the <i>Arizona Farmer-Ranchman.</i>

822
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,665
- The <i>Arizona...</i>
- The <i>Arizona Farmer-Ranchman.</i>

823
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,272
One was on good moos and bad moos.

824
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:13,542
The other was on head restraints
in cattle chutes and killing pens.

825
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:17,271
They're really badly designed.
Just terrible systems. Just...

826
01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:21,346
It's lovely to see you, Temple.

827
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:25,077
- Bye.
- Merry Christmas.

828
01:20:26,522 --> 01:20:27,921
Merry Christmas!

829
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:32,352
I need my squeeze machine!

830
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:38,924
I hate parties.

831
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:42,037
There are too many people
and no one listens to me.

832
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:45,374
And they keep giving each other looks
and I don't know what they mean.

833
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:47,601
They're just uncomfortable.

834
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:52,481
People don't want to hear
all those details about cattle.

835
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:54,817
Well, I do. I wanna be with cattle.

836
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:58,182
Sweetheart, I don't want you
to avoid people.

837
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:02,788
- They make me feel bad.
- Then ignore them.

838
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:08,759
You are the only Master of Science
in the room.

839
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:12,424
And I am so proud of you.

840
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:16,194
Temple, look at me. Look at me.

841
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:20,835
Do you know how people tell each other
things with their eyes?

842
01:21:22,545 --> 01:21:27,847
This is me telling you
that I love you and I respect you.

843
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:39,586
I will never learn how to do that.

844
01:21:41,764 --> 01:21:43,026
I know.

845
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:10,190
Hey! Damn it!

846
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,395
You are not allowed in here.

847
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,364
- I'm doing research for an article...
- No, ma'am.

848
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:18,300
We put up with you sneaking in here
when you was at Arizona State,

849
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,368
but you're done with that.

850
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:23,131
No college, no insurance coverage,
no access.

851
01:22:36,585 --> 01:22:38,921
<i>There are many other articles</i>
<i>I would like to write for you.</i>

852
01:22:39,021 --> 01:22:42,224
Firstly, how cattle can be introduced
into dip vats on their own accord.

853
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:44,849
- Secondly...
- Hold on, Miss Grandin.

854
01:22:45,027 --> 01:22:49,131
Firstly, your articles have been
greatly appreciated. I got a lot of calls.

855
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:51,066
Folks think you talk sense.

856
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:55,037
Secondly, I told you
I would read anything that you write.

857
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:58,641
And, thirdly, young lady,
you need another set of clothes

858
01:22:58,741 --> 01:23:01,510
- when you come into town on business.
- I need to be an accredited press person.

859
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:04,977
- Can I get a press pass?
- You asking for a staff job?

860
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:10,286
I ain't got but four staff, and two
of them are bookkeeping and distribution.

861
01:23:10,386 --> 01:23:14,117
No, I don't wanna work here.
I wanna be with cattle, so I need a pass.

862
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,791
Well, we can do that. But like I said...

863
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,455
Mary-Anne? Get in here.

864
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,527
Sir?

865
01:23:26,235 --> 01:23:28,437
How's that working for you, Miss Grandin?

866
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:30,971
It doesn't itch. I like it a lot.

867
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:40,042
That's my rank. They'll be able to see that.

868
01:23:43,085 --> 01:23:44,985
Hey, what... Damn it!

869
01:24:00,803 --> 01:24:02,794
Use it, Temple. You stink.

870
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:05,031
- Thank you.
- Temple?

871
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,437
Miss Temple Grandin?

872
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:10,672
I'm Ted Gilbert, from
John Wayne's Red River Feedlot.

873
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:12,246
Hello, I'm very pleased to meet you.

874
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:16,418
Hell, I've been reading your stuff.
How'd you like to put it into practice?

875
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:19,885
See, I lost my designer
and I need a new cattle dip.

876
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:25,755
Can you do it? It's pretty simple,
but I got to present plans in five days.

877
01:24:27,096 --> 01:24:28,188
Sure!

878
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:12,408
This is very clever.
How did you come up with this?

879
01:25:12,508 --> 01:25:13,909
I just see things and put them together.

880
01:25:14,009 --> 01:25:15,310
- So how long will it take you to...
- And all this?

881
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:16,812
That's to lead the cattle in.

882
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:19,048
They're happy to follow a curve
'cause they think they're going back

883
01:25:19,148 --> 01:25:20,349
- to where they came from.
- Lf you say so.

884
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:23,385
I do. So how long will it take you to do it?

885
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,454
Well, I have two or three more before this.

886
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:29,115
- But I need it by tomorrow!
- Everybody needs it tomorrow.

887
01:25:33,929 --> 01:25:35,431
I won't work any quicker with you watching.

888
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:37,658
- Well, I wanna watch.
- Okay.

889
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:24,813
Hey, Temple?

890
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:27,883
This here is Red Harris
from <i>Cattle</i> magazine.

891
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:29,318
Very nice to meet you, Mr. Harris.

892
01:26:29,418 --> 01:26:31,353
Yeah, Red, he can't make
the grand opening tomorrow,

893
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:33,155
so I thought we'd give him a sneak preview.

894
01:26:33,255 --> 01:26:37,025
So, Temple, will you put some cattle
through your dip while I'm here?

895
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,217
Okay.

896
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:40,957
Hey, open the gate!

897
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:51,106
So if the handlers walk slowly clockwise
outside the chute,

898
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,835
then the cow will walk counterclockwise
through the chute.

899
01:26:57,112 --> 01:26:59,637
See? They'll just follow that curve.

900
01:27:02,851 --> 01:27:05,487
The cattle just keep calmly walking

901
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:09,421
thinking they're going in circles
and following their buddies.

902
01:27:09,958 --> 01:27:11,693
And they're happy to follow a curve

903
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:15,024
because they think they're going back
to where they came from.

904
01:27:15,864 --> 01:27:19,001
They're okay because it's grooved
and they know they won't slip.

905
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:21,170
So when they take the next step,
their center of gravity

906
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:25,001
makes them drop calmly into the dip
and they just walk through the water.

907
01:27:38,754 --> 01:27:41,123
I don't usually tell people
what I'm gonna write,

908
01:27:41,223 --> 01:27:44,192
but, Miss Grandin, this is a masterpiece.

909
01:27:49,665 --> 01:27:51,200
- Hey!
- I don't like to do that.

910
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,368
I'm sorry there, Temple.

911
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:55,437
Now, look, I want you to be dressed
in your best outfit

912
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:57,300
tomorrow morning, okay?

913
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:59,402
Okay.

914
01:28:13,355 --> 01:28:15,157
Just look at this thing.

915
01:28:15,257 --> 01:28:17,384
It'll take us forever
to get them through here.

916
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:20,963
J.D., I want you to get the torch
and, Red, I want this out, this out.

917
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:24,055
I want those panels lined up
and we're gonna run them straight in.

918
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,861
Come on, boys. You two come with me.

919
01:28:26,068 --> 01:28:29,003
- Grab the other end of this.
- Now, hold on!

920
01:28:29,705 --> 01:28:33,197
Look at this! I mean, look at that!
Who'd build something like that?

921
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:36,411
Jess, get me some sheet steel.
We're gonna slide these puppies in here.

922
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:38,945
- Eric, where's that sheet steel?
- Hurry up!

923
01:28:49,224 --> 01:28:50,459
Let's go. Get up.

924
01:28:50,559 --> 01:28:52,160
Put them over in that pile
and get them out of here.

925
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,488
She's here.

926
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:56,722
Keep working, boys.
I'll take care of her. Pick it up.

927
01:28:58,233 --> 01:28:59,222
Miss.

928
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:05,503
Some dip you got here.

929
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:14,571
Who put steel on that slope?
Cattle can't walk on steel!

930
01:29:15,117 --> 01:29:17,119
That's designed so they'll walk slowly!

931
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:20,322
Excuse me, little miss.
We just had three head drown in here.

932
01:29:20,422 --> 01:29:24,381
That's your fault!
You killed them 'cause of your stupidity!

933
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,465
And why ain't they coming
through the curved chute?

934
01:29:30,565 --> 01:29:33,090
That'd take us all day, little lady!

935
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,761
Hey, that's my shirt!

936
01:29:36,004 --> 01:29:38,097
If it's smooth, they'll follow it!

937
01:29:38,273 --> 01:29:42,266
If there's stuff on it, they'll get scared!
You can't hang things!

938
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:45,781
- You wacko!
- Put it all back the way it was!

939
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:48,150
Temple, what's going on here?

940
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:53,654
They killed three cattle because
of their stupidity! They ruined it!

941
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:58,420
Just a minute!

942
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,064
- Cattle aren't dangerous!
- Temple?

943
01:30:02,164 --> 01:30:04,032
And they're predictable.
So it's not hard to design

944
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:06,134
- a system that won't hurt them!
- What are you doing in California?

945
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:09,171
But the cowboys would rather prod them
and scare them.

946
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:11,373
- Did you drive all night?
- I designed a dip vat

947
01:30:11,473 --> 01:30:15,136
at John Wayne Red River Feedlot based on
the way cattle see and think and behave

948
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,846
and the editor of <i>Cattle</i> magazine said
it was a masterpiece,

949
01:30:17,946 --> 01:30:20,682
but the cowboys killed three cows in it!

950
01:30:20,782 --> 01:30:25,276
Three. In five minutes.
Because they wouldn't follow my design!

951
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,556
- Temple, would you like to sit down?
- I can't protect the cattle...

952
01:30:27,656 --> 01:30:28,757
I'm just having a cup of tea.

953
01:30:28,857 --> 01:30:30,225
...unless I design the whole system

954
01:30:30,325 --> 01:30:34,129
from the moment they enter
to the moment they get slaughtered.

955
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:35,764
Are you talking about a slaughterhouse?

956
01:30:35,864 --> 01:30:37,933
Well, of course
they're gonna get slaughtered.

957
01:30:38,033 --> 01:30:41,169
Do you think we'd have cattle
if people didn't eat them every day?

958
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:43,605
They'd just be
funny-looking animals in zoos.

959
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:46,173
No, we raise them for us.

960
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:49,036
That means we owe them some respect.

961
01:30:50,512 --> 01:30:54,278
Nature is cruel, but we don't have to be.

962
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:58,546
I wouldn't want to have my guts
ripped out by a lion.

963
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:02,224
I'd much rather die in a slaughterhouse
if it was done right!

964
01:31:02,324 --> 01:31:03,825
Well, it seems to me that you should be

965
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:05,627
- the one who's to design...
- We can easily do it in a way

966
01:31:05,727 --> 01:31:09,331
where they don't feel pain
and they don't get scared.

967
01:31:09,431 --> 01:31:10,799
And their cortisol levels
go through the roof!

968
01:31:10,899 --> 01:31:13,268
Okay. Did you hear what I said, Temple?
I think you're the one

969
01:31:13,368 --> 01:31:15,070
- who should design the slaughterhouse.
- Yeah, I'm going...

970
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:18,799
I know a slaughterhouse that's a mess
and I know exactly how to fix it.

971
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:57,073
It's a door. It's another door.

972
01:32:05,654 --> 01:32:06,988
Can I help you?

973
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:10,489
Hello, it's very nice to meet you.
I'd like to tour your slaughterhouse.

974
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:11,990
Excuse me?

975
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:16,298
Hello, it's very nice to meet you.
I'd like to tour your slaughterhouse.

976
01:32:16,398 --> 01:32:17,799
We don't do tours, ma'am.

977
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:20,502
I designed a dip vat at
John Wayne's Red River Feedlot

978
01:32:20,602 --> 01:32:22,471
that the editor of <i>Cattle</i> magazine
said was a masterpiece...

979
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:25,631
Security? Can I get security
to the front office?

980
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:55,036
<i>Temple, I'm so sorry to leave this message</i>
<i>on your answering machine,</i>

981
01:32:55,136 --> 01:33:00,164
<i>but I thought you'd want to know</i>
<i>that your friend Dr. Carlock has died.</i>

982
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:04,076
- Well, I just saw him!
- <i>Apparently, he'd been sick for some time.</i>

983
01:33:04,446 --> 01:33:07,973
<i>You can call me anytime. Bye, sweetheart.</i>

984
01:33:10,118 --> 01:33:11,915
I just saw him.

985
01:33:19,995 --> 01:33:21,485
What are they doing?

986
01:33:22,564 --> 01:33:28,025
They're paying their respects.
It's a way of saying thank you and goodbye.

987
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:31,306
I said goodbye when I saw him.

988
01:33:31,406 --> 01:33:34,102
And this is a final chance to say goodbye.

989
01:34:47,082 --> 01:34:50,685
Temple. Temple. Are you all right?

990
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:52,218
I'm leaving now.

991
01:34:52,921 --> 01:34:54,322
Well, it isn't over yet.

992
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:57,391
I said goodbye when I saw him.
He's not there.

993
01:34:59,327 --> 01:35:01,852
I've got him in my mind.

994
01:35:04,966 --> 01:35:06,558
Do you know where they go?

995
01:35:08,303 --> 01:35:10,771
No. No, I don't.

996
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:16,977
Okay. I'm gonna go now.

997
01:35:28,423 --> 01:35:30,084
Drive safely.

998
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:00,820
There you are, ma'am.

999
01:36:16,137 --> 01:36:18,537
My, that's a pretty blouse.

1000
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:21,843
I hope you don't mind me saying so.

1001
01:36:21,943 --> 01:36:24,279
Some people think I'm forward,
but, you know, if I like something,

1002
01:36:24,379 --> 01:36:27,816
I just come right out
and just compliment them.

1003
01:36:27,916 --> 01:36:30,510
It's nice to get a compliment,
don't you think?

1004
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:34,322
Thank you. It's very nice to meet you.
I'm Temple Grandin.

1005
01:36:34,422 --> 01:36:37,152
Well, it's nice to meet you, too. I'm Betty.

1006
01:36:38,726 --> 01:36:40,694
Well, then, there we are.

1007
01:36:42,464 --> 01:36:44,399
Are you waiting to meet
somebody or something?

1008
01:36:44,499 --> 01:36:47,535
No, I have trouble with automatic doors
sometimes when I'm nervous.

1009
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,193
I'm autistic.

1010
01:36:51,072 --> 01:36:55,009
My son is artistic and he's got
the same thing with airplanes.

1011
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:57,805
Come on. You just come along with me.

1012
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:04,044
All right. Come on. And...
And I'll make sure that they stay open.

1013
01:37:06,921 --> 01:37:09,515
All right? You are safe now. You're safe.

1014
01:37:16,364 --> 01:37:19,197
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1015
01:37:20,602 --> 01:37:23,371
Are you a horsewoman?
I mean, you know, your shirt?

1016
01:37:23,471 --> 01:37:26,167
Well, I like horses, but I work with cattle.

1017
01:37:26,608 --> 01:37:29,844
I designed a dip
that <i>Cattle</i> magazine called brilliant.

1018
01:37:29,944 --> 01:37:32,913
Oh, my golly, my husband read about you.

1019
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:35,049
He works over at Abbot.

1020
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:37,352
- Abbot slaughterhouse?
- Yeah. You heard of it?

1021
01:37:37,452 --> 01:37:40,188
I wanna redesign it. I went there,
but they wouldn't let me meet with them.

1022
01:37:40,288 --> 01:37:42,390
But I have several ideas
about how to make a new facility

1023
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:45,288
that will be much more humane
and efficient.

1024
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,957
Well, I guess you just have to meet
my husband then.

1025
01:37:49,063 --> 01:37:51,964
How wonderful
that we bumped into each other.

1026
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:58,798
- A door opened and I went through it.
- Yes, you did.

1027
01:37:59,607 --> 01:38:01,097
And I held it.

1028
01:38:08,116 --> 01:38:10,018
This looks like an airport for cows.

1029
01:38:10,118 --> 01:38:11,486
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1030
01:38:11,586 --> 01:38:14,689
- Thank you.
- I didn't mean that as a compliment.

1031
01:38:14,789 --> 01:38:17,155
And conveyor belts for cattle?

1032
01:38:18,293 --> 01:38:21,353
Do you have any idea
what the cost is on this?

1033
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:25,090
And you've got solid walls and floors.

1034
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:29,304
We have those slatted for a reason.
It's cheaper.

1035
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:32,273
I'm sorry, Miss Grandin.
It's clear you just don't have the experience

1036
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:33,641
to design something like this.

1037
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:38,379
The walls are solid so the cattle won't be
distracted by light or movement outside.

1038
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:41,749
- They balk at unexpected things.
- I'm sure that's nice for the cattle,

1039
01:38:41,849 --> 01:38:44,252
- but the cost, Miss...
- How much money does it cost you

1040
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:46,654
to pay handlers to prod the cattle along

1041
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:49,257
and then hold them back
when they stampede?

1042
01:38:49,357 --> 01:38:53,127
How many times a day do your chutes stop
because of pile-ups?

1043
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:56,698
How many cows break a leg
and bring everything to a halt?

1044
01:38:56,798 --> 01:39:01,826
With my system, there'd be none of that.
There'd be a steady, calm flow.

1045
01:39:02,637 --> 01:39:06,174
Well, that sounds great, but you don't have
any idea of whether it'll work or not.

1046
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:09,377
But I do.
I'm like Nikola Tesla or Thomas Edison.

1047
01:39:09,477 --> 01:39:11,813
I know my system will work
'cause I've been through it

1048
01:39:11,913 --> 01:39:13,715
a thousand times in my head.

1049
01:39:13,815 --> 01:39:15,850
I can see a chute just as the cattle will

1050
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:18,319
because that's something
my autism lets me do.

1051
01:39:18,419 --> 01:39:23,925
I can walk through a plan in my mind,
examining every beam and every rivet.

1052
01:39:24,025 --> 01:39:28,291
I mean, you just see a plan,
but I'm walking through the whole plant.

1053
01:39:29,497 --> 01:39:33,134
Okay, the cattle go through
a series of solid curves.

1054
01:39:33,234 --> 01:39:35,828
And the floor is solid, too, grooved.

1055
01:39:36,671 --> 01:39:38,740
The chute gets smaller,
but the cattle won't mind.

1056
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,375
They don't... They don't see any danger.

1057
01:39:40,475 --> 01:39:43,311
They think
they're just getting into another truck.

1058
01:39:43,411 --> 01:39:46,073
<i>The stairway leads them gently upwards.</i>

1059
01:39:46,214 --> 01:39:48,546
<i>The floor becomes a conveyor.</i>

1060
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:53,849
<i>A rest rises up to meet their chest</i>
<i>so they're comfortably carried.</i>

1061
01:39:55,223 --> 01:39:57,555
They'll be very calm.

1062
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:12,130
<i>Nature is cruel, but we don't have to be.</i>

1063
01:40:13,041 --> 01:40:15,032
<i>We owe them some respect.</i>

1064
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:21,772
<i>I touched the first cow</i>
<i>as it was being stunned.</i>

1065
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:24,786
<i>In a few seconds, it was gonna be</i>
<i>just another piece of beef,</i>

1066
01:40:24,886 --> 01:40:28,117
<i>but in that moment,</i>
<i>it was still an individual.</i>

1067
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:30,757
<i>It was calm.</i>

1068
01:40:33,928 --> 01:40:35,418
<i>And then it was gone.</i>

1069
01:40:37,231 --> 01:40:40,132
<i>I became aware of how precious life was.</i>

1070
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:44,460
<i>And I thought about death</i>
<i>and I felt close to God.</i>

1071
01:40:48,476 --> 01:40:50,910
I don't want my thoughts to die with me.

1072
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:53,144
I want to have done something.

1073
01:40:55,283 --> 01:40:57,183
Thank you for inviting me.

1074
01:40:58,052 --> 01:41:00,888
You're the one person I wanted here.

1075
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:03,925
Other people would have been overwhelmed
by what they were seeing.

1076
01:41:04,025 --> 01:41:05,293
It would have confused them.

1077
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:08,796
I knew that you would be the only one
able to sense what was really going on,

1078
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:11,694
who could feel
what I was trying to accomplish.

1079
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:14,102
I know there are a lot of things
I can't understand,

1080
01:41:14,202 --> 01:41:17,365
but I still want my life to have meaning.

1081
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:29,512
I don't know that I want to hear
from any more experts.

1082
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:33,187
- That doesn't work!
- We've been trying those things for years!

1083
01:41:33,287 --> 01:41:34,889
<i>Will you please let me finish?</i>

1084
01:41:34,989 --> 01:41:38,083
<i>With intensive psychotherapy,</i>
<i>an autistic child can be treated...</i>

1085
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:41,529
But the Rimland report plainly shows that
autism is not a psychological problem.

1086
01:41:41,629 --> 01:41:43,898
- <i>I am not familiar with the Rimland report.</i>
- Calm down. Calm down.

1087
01:41:43,998 --> 01:41:45,833
Calm down, sweetie. Sweetie, calm down.
Calm down.

1088
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:48,102
<i>It would be better</i>
<i>if you could get her to sit calmly.</i>

1089
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:50,104
- <i>You know, try to control her.</i>
- <i>What are you talking about?</i>

1090
01:41:50,204 --> 01:41:53,174
<i>But we were told self-stimming is good.</i>
<i>It eventually calms them.</i>

1091
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:55,043
<i>Self-stimming is self- comforting.</i>

1092
01:41:55,143 --> 01:41:58,646
Self-stimulation, rocking, spinning,
rolling on the floor, flapping the...

1093
01:41:58,746 --> 01:42:00,839
Well, I think spinning is good.

1094
01:42:01,015 --> 01:42:02,817
And rolling, too.

1095
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:06,821
Self-stimulation does seem to eventually
calm the nervous system.

1096
01:42:06,921 --> 01:42:10,058
It can be a way to compensate
for not being held.

1097
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:12,360
And being held by another person is scary,

1098
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:16,164
but rolling or,
or being held by surfaces produces

1099
01:42:16,264 --> 01:42:19,167
the calming effect
that ordinary children get from a hug.

1100
01:42:19,267 --> 01:42:20,700
How old is your child?

1101
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:24,327
Well, I don't have children.

1102
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:27,303
No, I'm autistic.

1103
01:42:28,009 --> 01:42:30,910
And I need the sensation of being hugged.

1104
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:34,415
And I've developed a machine
that I get into and hugs me

1105
01:42:34,515 --> 01:42:37,541
and I'm different afterwards.
I'm more social.

1106
01:42:38,085 --> 01:42:40,488
Well, I didn't speak until I was four

1107
01:42:40,588 --> 01:42:44,820
and now I have a B.A. And a master's
and I'm studying for my doctorate.

1108
01:42:45,059 --> 01:42:47,795
- How did you learn to speak?
- How's it possible?

1109
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:50,231
Please don't shout. Please don't...

1110
01:42:50,331 --> 01:42:55,200
Most autistic people are very sensitive
to sounds and colors.

1111
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:59,265
Over-stimulation hurts.

1112
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:02,677
You know,
people talking too much at once,

1113
01:43:02,777 --> 01:43:04,479
you know, can cause us to panic.

1114
01:43:04,579 --> 01:43:06,570
How did you get cured?

1115
01:43:07,215 --> 01:43:10,651
Well, I'm not cured. I'll always be autistic.

1116
01:43:11,219 --> 01:43:15,155
My mother refused to believe
that I wouldn't speak.

1117
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:18,690
And when I learned to speak,
she made me go to school.

1118
01:43:19,293 --> 01:43:24,458
And in school and at home,
manners and rules were really important.

1119
01:43:24,632 --> 01:43:27,902
They were pounded into me. I was lucky.

1120
01:43:28,002 --> 01:43:30,071
All these things worked for me.

1121
01:43:30,171 --> 01:43:33,307
Everyone worked hard
to make sure that I was engaged.

1122
01:43:33,407 --> 01:43:36,535
I mean, they knew I was different,
but not less.

1123
01:43:36,878 --> 01:43:38,346
You know, I had a gift.

1124
01:43:38,446 --> 01:43:40,114
I could see the world in a new way.

1125
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:43,672
I could see details
that other people were blind to.

1126
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:48,656
My mother pushed me
to become self-sufficient.

1127
01:43:48,756 --> 01:43:51,459
I worked summers at my aunt's ranch.

1128
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:55,463
I went to boarding school and college
and those things...

1129
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:57,498
Those things
were uncomfortable for me at first,

1130
01:43:57,598 --> 01:44:00,568
but they helped me
to open doors to new worlds.

1131
01:44:00,668 --> 01:44:04,272
Excuse me, please,
but we want to hear everything.

1132
01:44:04,372 --> 01:44:06,874
- Yes. Please.
- Yes. Please tell us.

1133
01:44:06,974 --> 01:44:09,636
- Please, everything you can tell us.
- Yes. Tell us, please.

1134
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:30,965
<i>Are you a scientist?</i>

1135
01:44:31,065 --> 01:44:32,099
- <i>French fish!</i>
- <i>French fish!</i>

1136
01:44:32,199 --> 01:44:34,168
- <i>You cannot hit people.</i>
- <i>You think you can figure it out?</i>

1137
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:38,940
- <i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>
- <i>I have a pen and a clipboard.</i>

1138
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:40,842
<i>Think of it as a door.</i>

1139
01:44:40,942 --> 01:44:44,879
- <i>It just takes one knock to the head.</i>
- <i>I don't understand why people are cruel</i>

1140
01:44:44,979 --> 01:44:47,648
- <i>for no reason!</i>
- <i>You have a very special mind.</i>

1141
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:49,750
<i>You see the world in ways that others can't.</i>

1142
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:52,053
<i>Miss Grandin, this is a masterpiece.</i>

1143
01:44:52,153 --> 01:44:56,290
- <i>A door opened and I went through it.</i>
- <i>Yes, you</i> did.

1144
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:57,880
<i>And I held it.</i>

1145
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:04,120
I'm Temple Grandin.

1146

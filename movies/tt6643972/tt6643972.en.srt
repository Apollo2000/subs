[Long-Fei] Yeah, no good there.

he did not like my cooking.

can have access to an education,

that the greatest wealth

507

509

These crime syndicates must go.

on the right side of the law.

00:46:39,056 --> 00:46:40,456
No, you do as your fuckin' told
and get in the van.

827
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,091
Who do you think
you're talking to, eh?

828
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:44,159
You keep telling me what to do,
and you're pissing me off.

829
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:46,362
We're running around the streets
with fuckin' machine guns.

830
00:46:46,364 --> 00:46:47,263
Look at the eyes on us!

831
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:49,064
How long is it gonna be
before the police turn up?

832
00:46:49,066 --> 00:46:50,366
You take that,
you get to the van,

833
00:46:50,368 --> 00:46:51,936
and you do
as you're fucking told!

835

[in Mandarin]
[Lee] Sir.

836
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:06,248
[in Mandarin] Oh. Lee,
you've arrived just in time.

837
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,184
[ambassador] These are signed.

838
00:47:09,186 --> 00:47:10,286
You can send them out.

839
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:15,226
Of course, but I have
something urgent to report.

840
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:16,660
What?

841
00:47:16,662 --> 00:47:21,997
There has been an attack
on the Nagavara Hotel.

842
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:24,400
Are Liang and Xiao Xian safe?

843
00:47:24,402 --> 00:47:26,835
Liang is injured.
She's in the hospital.

844
00:47:26,837 --> 00:47:29,539
Xiao Xian is missing.

845
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:30,774
Missing?

846
00:47:30,776 --> 00:47:32,941
Liang believes Xiao Xian
must have run

847
00:47:32,943 --> 00:47:34,310
to the Chinese Embassy.

848
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:38,849
[Lee] But so far,
we haven't heard from her.

849
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:44,021
Get me
the Maha Jaya Chief of Police.

[in English]
Yeah?

852
00:47:57,034 --> 00:47:58,802
[Su Feng] You messed up
the contract, Collins.

853
00:47:58,804 --> 00:48:01,136
Do I need to engage someone else
to take care of this?

854
00:48:01,138 --> 00:48:03,238
[Collins]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Su Feng.

855
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,641
Everything's under control,
all right?

856
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:06,476
[Su Feng]
<i>If this is under control,</i>

857
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:08,545
I'd hate to see
what out of control looks like.

858
00:48:08,547 --> 00:48:10,480
It'll look like me decimating
any other team

859
00:48:10,482 --> 00:48:11,447
that gets in my way,

860
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:14,183
so back off
and let us do our job.

861
00:48:14,185 --> 00:48:15,752
You should come and see me.

862

[Collins] <i>Not yet.</i>

863
00:48:16,954 --> 00:48:18,954
I'll have this spotless
before the sun comes up.

864
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:20,322
I'll come and see you then.

I haven't got time for this.

869

[in Thai] Turn back!
Put your hands on your head!

a big mistake, pal.

We should talk.

[Collins] I'm a little busy
right now, mate.

875

Let's not play games.

880
00:49:08,774 --> 00:49:10,139
I could work with you.

881
00:49:10,141 --> 00:49:12,141
I can help you take down
the dude that you're after.

882
00:49:12,143 --> 00:49:13,843
I'm not looking
for an apprentice right now.

883

Thank you very much.

884
00:49:15,714 --> 00:49:18,515
Who exactly are they,
and what do you want with them?

885
00:49:18,517 --> 00:49:21,851
[Jaka] They're mercenaries,
like me.

886
00:49:21,853 --> 00:49:24,420
I've been after them for years.

887
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:27,724
Looking at your situation,
I'd say you need some help.

888
00:49:27,726 --> 00:49:30,259
And how exactly do you suppose
you're gonna help me?

889
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:32,227
I know my way around the city.

890
00:49:32,229 --> 00:49:34,633
And I know the same people
they do and how they work.

they also have the girl
you're after.

894
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:45,109
Look, if we work together,
we can both get what we want.

895
00:49:48,379 --> 00:49:50,114
You can certainly
handle yourself.

896
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:54,051
Maybe I could use a little bit
of local assistance.

897
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,487
We better get out of here

898
00:49:57,489 --> 00:49:59,156
before his mates turn up
don't you?

What were you doing

902
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,139
at the police station?

903
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:19,074
[Long-Fei] We were
in an underground fight.

904
00:50:19,076 --> 00:50:21,278
There may have been
some gambling involved.

Did you guys win?

906
00:50:26,952 --> 00:50:29,353
Of course. We are professionals.

And he is?

00:50:35,226 --> 00:50:36,460
That's Payu.

Thank you.

Anytime.

[in Mandarin]
Can I trust you guys?

913
00:50:48,372 --> 00:50:52,009
The police aren't an option.
Do you have a choice?

You drive. I'll navigate.

this is a cop car, right?

00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:36,721
We're just going to borrow it.

923
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:40,122
You should drive.

924

This is not the time to joke.

you can't drive?

I don't know how to drive.

How come you can't drive?

just not a professional driver.

you could handle it.

Well, it's pretty simple,
really.

Remind me and the lads

All of you are ex-military.

coming out of our asses, mate.

Pretty soon, someone somewhere
is gonna give her up.

She is well-connected in China
and has nowhere to go.

She will head
to the Chinese Embassy.

Xiao Xian, where are you?

Madame Liang,
I hope you're better now.

993
00:54:56,621 --> 00:54:59,889
We can see the embassy,

but we're stuck
behind the roadblock.

Who are you with?

They're helping me out.

To the center, do you copy?

- Jaka.
- What are you doing?

1033
00:57:10,021 --> 00:57:11,787
You used us a bait.

1034
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:13,356
[Jaka] Be patient, my friend.

1035
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:16,192
My fight is with Collins,
not you.

1036
00:57:16,194 --> 00:57:17,427
Just keep moving.

1037

[Jaka] They were here.
We just lost them.

[Devereaux] And here you are.

1042
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:42,685
I followed them from the crash.
Lost them in the market.

1043

You're always in the right place
at the right time, huh?

[Jaka] That's why you need me.

[Joey] Collins, over here.

Good job.

You know my gut
has kept me alive,

sort of like a sixth sense.

1049

And you know
what my gut is telling me?

1050

You're up to something.

If you have a point to make,
make it.

[in Mandarin] Tell me how
you know these people?

1081
01:01:13,264 --> 01:01:14,230
[Long-Fei] We were hired

for a humanitarian
rescue mission, only it wasn't.

1083

Instead, they freed Collins
and left us for dead.

And who is the guy
at the market?

He's with the foreigners,
but he's one of us.

[Long-Fei] It's complicated.

Complicated?

1088
01:01:30,582 --> 01:01:33,483
His people were killed

Now, what?

[in Mandarin] So was it
your dad's mission or yours?

1117
01:03:06,944 --> 01:03:09,481
It was my dad's mission
that I embraced.

1118

Enough about me. What about you?

You two were obviously
professionally trained.

Why did you leave China?

1121

[Long-Fei] When I was young,
my father brought me here.

We've been living here
since then.

[Long-Fei]
I want to make enough money

01:03:36,007 --> 01:03:38,541
to bring my father
back to China.

1127

But now, I cannot go home.

1128
01:03:42,913 --> 01:03:47,484
Since you saved me,
maybe I can help you?

1129
01:03:47,486 --> 01:03:51,956
I know a lot of people.
I'll find a way.

I am painfully aware of that.

It's gonna get

I don't think so.

[Payu] It's too dangerous.

1180

Well, we need to come up
with some sort of plan.

Well, I'm pretty sure

he'd like to speak
with you, too.

Hey, Collins, this is precious.

Oh, well, fuck me,
I was not expecting that.

01:07:33,778 --> 01:07:35,010
- It's bullshit, bro.
- Wait, wait.

Let's see what he's gotta say.

A hundred thousand dollars, eh?

1205
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:49,559
Yeah, all right.

1206
01:07:49,561 --> 01:07:50,894
[Collins] Got yourself a deal.

1207
01:07:50,896 --> 01:07:53,328
But do me favor, don't be late.

1208

- I've got a deadline to meet.
- [phone beeps]

Now you know he's trying
to set us up, right?

1210
01:08:00,237 --> 01:08:02,037
Don't tell me you trust
that little bastard.

No, I don't trust him.

But I do trust
that they'll be there

whether they're settin' us up
or not.

So I say we use
all the cash we got left.

You find me as many shooters
as you can wrangle.

- Shooters?
- [Collins] Yeah.

1217
01:08:14,418 --> 01:08:17,286
Ugly motherfuckers with guns
who get paid to kill people.

- I know what shooters are.
- Well, good.

We get there early.
We don't fuck about.

We set a few little traps.

Not everything I did was good.

I can't say
they didn't deserve it.

- No, no, no.

- Stop.

Yeah, yeah, man.

01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:27,537
[Devereaux] We ran

Up in the north.

Yeah, they were being used

Yeah, yeah. They were terrible.

1288

We deep sixed 'em all.

1289

[Devereaux] Left 'em

That doesn't bother you,
does it?

Get off my back.

1296
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:54,599
I'll get off your back.

1297
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,867
I just thought it was something
that you wanted

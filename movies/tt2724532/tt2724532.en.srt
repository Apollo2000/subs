1
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,399
Tensions are mounting
as some of the protesters

2
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,094
have already started gathering
here in New York City

3
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,362
across the street from the United Nations,

4
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,703
where it was just announced
that the Israeli Prime Minister

5
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,402
would address
the assembly later this month.

6
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,443
More on that to come.
But first, let's go to Danielle.

7
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,686
And in entertainment news,
actor Brody Walker

8
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:32,756
is making headlines after a video
leaked online earlier this week.

9
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,052
The footage shows an intoxicated Walker

10
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,719
attempting to drive himself home
after leaving a nightclub.

11
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,025
When a paparazzo confronted him,
Walker assaulted the man.

12
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,098
- You doing all right tonight?
- I'm always good, bro.

13
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,736
Yeah, you gonna drive, dude?

14
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,130
I'm a big boy. I can figure it out.

15
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,866
Got some DUIs last month.
You sure you want number three?

16
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,305
- **** you, dude.
- Come on, man.

17
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,467
Don't get in that car.

18
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,237
You gonna be drunk on set tomorrow, Brody?

19
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,643
- What did you say?
- Too many DUIs, man.

20
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,444
- Too many ******* DUIs?
- No, you're good. Hey!

21
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,986
A former child star, Walker's films
have collectively grossed

22
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,987
over half a billion dollars.

23
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:10,094
But sources say his run-ins with the
law and his purported substance abuse

24
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,957
have left those around him worried.

25
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,225
This doesn't fare well for Walker
who just landed a major role

26
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,597
in an upcoming franchise
that starts shooting later this...

27
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,013
Marty, it's not as bad as it looks.

28
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,913
Oh, really? Because it looks
pretty fucking bad to me.

29
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,613
I've been on the phone
all morning with the studio.

30
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,017
They're getting cold feet.

31
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,583
You said it was a done deal.

32
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,748
This is Hollywood. It's never a done deal.

33
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,328
Do you have any idea the kind of
hoops that I had to jump through

34
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,125
just to get you fucking insured
on this thing?

35
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,700
Brody, this is serious.
Do you understand that?

36
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,300
- They want to press charges.
- I barely even pushed the guy.

37
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,600
It doesn't make a difference.
This isn't your first criminal offense,

38
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,765
and you can't afford a scandal right now.

39
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,710
- Do you get that?
- Then pay him off.

40
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,779
Oh, that's brilliant.

41
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,612
See, just pay him off, Bill.

42
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,384
That's all. Can I ask you a question?
Seriously.

43
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,146
Are you just naive
or a complete fucking idiot?

44
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,717
Yeah. Bill, what the fuck
are we gonna do with this guy?

45
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,492
Huh? You don't know? That's great.

46
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,992
We got to figure a way
to avoid a conviction.

47
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,327
- Oh, really?
- Got to appease the courts.

48
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,973
We got to make it look like
he's going to lake responsibility,

49
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,235
and we're gonna spin it and try
to get the studio back on set.

50
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,504
And how do you suggest
that we do that, Bill?

51
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,673
No idea.

52
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,411
Doesn't know. Terrific.

53
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,681
You know what?

54
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,722
Maybe there's a way to
make an example of him.

55
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,423
Make it look like we're taking
a loss, but really everybody wins.

56
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,161
I love that. How are we gonna do that?

57
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,068
Let me talk to the prosecutor
about that. I got an idea.

58
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,898
But he has to plead guilty.

59
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,740
Whoa! Absolutely not!

60
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,071
No fucking way! I'm not pleading guilty.

61
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,212
Brody Walker plead guilty to assault
and battery charges just weeks after

62
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,850
an incident involving him
attacking a photographer.

63
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,552
However, Walker's lawyers accepted
a plea bargain and admitted him into

64
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,021
a judicial diversion program which
will see him spend time shadowing

65
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,626
law enforcement
for the duration of his sentence.

66
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,460
Walker's lawyer, Bill Donner,
says that they are confident

67
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,860
that he will complete
the program successfully

68
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,932
and that he should be back
at work shortly.

69
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,893
The nice thing is that he's
already staying out of trouble.

70
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:37,833
And I can assure you that he's
under the care of New York's finest.

71
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,193
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Face down.

72
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,032
All right. Cool.

73
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,632
Hands behind your back.

74
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,109
That pain you're feeling,
that's carbon steel.

75
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,180
That's temporary compared
to the pain you will feel

76
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,315
if you don't tell me what I need to know.

77
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,514
Nod your head if you understand.

78
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,653
Good. On your side.

79
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,349
Ease up.

80
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,284
Is he with you?

81
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,064
I told you to wait in the car.

82
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,890
Hey!

83
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,037
Yo! Was that Brody Walker? Damn!

84
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15,400
- Shut up.
- Take it easy. He's a fan.

85
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,701
Hey, Brody! Damn!

86
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,157
I don't believe this shit.

87
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,869
Are you kidding me? Damn!

88
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,244
Oh, man. I knew that was you, man.

89
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:28,147
Brody Walker. Yo, Double Barrel,
I loved that movie, man.

90
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,050
That's my jam. Hey, yo. You think
we can get a photo real quick?

91
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,748
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- Don't even think about it.

92
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,553
What? You can't talk to Brody Walker
like that, man.

93
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,018
Incredible Hulk.

94
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,226
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

95
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,528
Brody! Get in the car.

96
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,731
Hey, yo. When you tweet that,
hashtag thug life, hashtag we made it.

97
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,086
So when do I get to arrest somebody
or hold a gun or something?

98
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,691
What? I should be able to do
everything you do

99
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,451
except I'll do it with
a little more compassion.

100
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,686
Look at this guy.

101
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,223
Yeah, man. My arm hurts.

102
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,123
- See?
- Hey.

103
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,898
- You better listen to Brody, man.
- Yeah, listen to Brody.

104
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,259
Disrespectful, yo.

105
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,461
That's what I'm talking about.

106
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,531
Movie star, bro.

107
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,437
I just feel that,

108
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,241
you know, I just think that you and I
should be chasing something bigger

109
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,816
instead of wasting our time
busting crack heads. No offense.

110
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,452
None taken, Brody.

111
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,781
I mean, shit, I ain't do nothing anyway.

112
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,952
Hello. You've reached the offices of Dr...

113
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,419
How much are they
paying you to babysit me?

114
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,321
Not nearly enough.

115
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,801
On a scale of one to ten, ten being good.

116
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,062
Really good.

117
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,601
Do you even like what you do?

118
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,011
Whoa, man! That's my head.

119
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,938
Let's get something straight.
This is not a game.

120
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,814
The last thing I wanna do
is babysit you. You got that?

121
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,118
I'm your last line of defense from
you spending the rest of your life

122
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,247
in a concrete closet. So sit back,
shut up, do as you're told,

123
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,325
and you and I will get on just fine.
Have you got that?

124
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,353
- Have you got it?
- Yeah.

125
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,424
Great.

126
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:12,983
- Is that Scotty?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,880
You better move on through.
I got this one.

128
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,714
- Thanks, Sully.
- All right, buddy.

129
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,186
Jason. Hey.

130
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,350
Oh, so close. Maybe next time.

131
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,651
Come on, Sully.
I could've slipped through here.

132
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,694
- Protocol.
- What are you...?

133
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,225
Protocol.

134
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:30,926
You got to be kidding.

135
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,365
Thank you.

136
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,061
Access granted, Scott.

137
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,425
Hey.

138
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,064
There are reasons
for the protocol we follow.

139
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,868
One of them being that I get to do
more than just sit at a desk all day.

140
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,734
Yeah.

141
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,539
- See you around, Sully.
- All right.

142
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,811
Thanks for that.

143
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,714
Anytime, rookie.

144
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,090
I don't understand, man.
I'm coming up on two months,

145
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,093
and the old man still demands
to see my ID every single time.

146
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,963
I'm at two years. Get used to it.

147
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,567
Some things never change.

148
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,600
Hey, hold up a sec.

149
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,799
What did we say about being first one in?

150
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,069
Come on.

151
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:49,836
Yeah?

152
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,609
Rookies are first in
or you get friendly with the mop.

153
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,649
That's right.
You get friendly with the mop.

154
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,613
So what happened today?

155
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,118
I wasn't first in.

156
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,683
No, you weren't.

157
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,151
All right.

158
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,763
- Keep it up, rookie.
- Thanks for the advice.

159
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,159
Sorry, what's that?

160
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,323
Fuck yourself.

161
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:12,996
Fair enough.

162
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,974
Yo, police brutality, man!
Ain't none of y'all seeing this?

163
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,632
- Shut up.
- I told you watch out for my arm.

164
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,210
Hey, brother! My brother!
Look at this shit, man!

165
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,142
Hey, listen!
This man needs anger management!

166
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,442
- Take care of this asshole!
- What the hell?

167
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,516
Hey, Brody! Wait for me. All right?

168
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,649
What the hell are you doing?
Go and sit down.

169
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,049
What's going on, Vince?
This place is empty.

170
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,290
Short staffed. Summer's tomorrow.

171
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,487
- What's up?
- It's where the PM lands at two.

172
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:42,461
Chiefs trying to make everything
work out following his code.

173
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,499
Mm-hmm, no excuses, no overtime, right?

174
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,298
There isn't gonna be any overtime
if you stick around long enough.

175
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:52,006
I've been pleading for a bigger holding cell
ever since the brass dropped you off here.

176
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,803
Don't hold your breath.

177
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,138
Never do.

178
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,846
So how long does this usually take?

179
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,649
Depends.

180
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,016
On?

181
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:11,918
The bust.

182
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,557
What about this one?

183
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,900
Of course not.

184
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,833
So when are you gonna let me
shoot someone?

185
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,572
When they start irritating me.

186
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,621
So what's it like hanging with Brody?

187
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,860
Highlight of my fucking life.

188
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,205
You think you might be able to
hook me up with an autograph?

189
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,532
You know, for the kids?

190
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,535
Vince, you don't have kids.

191
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,814
Doc, this is Dave Hendrix.

192
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,908
- Been trying to reach you all day.
- Yes, David.

193
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,384
Hi. Look, we're not
supposed to be talking.

194
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,324
Okay, Fed-Ex this express,
not by fucking donkey, okay?

195
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,736
Brody, hi. What's happening?

196
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,069
Marty, I don't wanna do this anymore.

197
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,732
What's the problem?

198
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,570
Problem? Problem is I've been sitting
on my ass for three days

199
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,304
watching this guy bust fucking
meth heads. That's the problem.

200
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,142
You said I'd get to see some real action.

201
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,806
You said I'd get to fire a gun.

202
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:44,846
No. What I said was if you're lucky,
you might get to see him fire his gun.

203
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,491
Listen, I need to get back to my team.

204
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,186
We've been over this already.
You're still in the recovery stage.

205
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,522
I can't clear you.

206
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,925
Come on, Doc.

207
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,766
I've been closing down gangsters and thugs
for weeks without breaking a sweat.

208
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,029
You should see some of the shit
they got me assigned to.

209
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,997
Marty, this isn't what you told me.

210
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:06,307
Brody, a lot of actors have endured
a lot worse just to get that dream role.

211
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,969
Marlon Brando,
Daniel Day-Lewis or Ed Norton.

212
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,442
Ed Norton actually joined the Aryan
Brotherhood for American History X.

213
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,151
The dude tattooed a fucking swastika
on his chest, Brody.

214
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,380
On his fucking chest.
And it's still there.

215
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,026
Doc, I really need to do my job.

216
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:27,564
What you've got to do is you have
to grow a pair of big boy nuts

217
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,734
and suck it up because this is not
public indecency, Brody.

218
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,701
This is fucking assault,
which means if you don't do this,

219
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,307
you go to fucking jail.

220
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,307
You go to fucking jail,
then you don't do the fucking movie.

221
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,645
There's no fucking movie, you can
kiss your fucking career goodbye!

222
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,142
Okay, I'm just trying to
make myself perfectly clear.

223
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,148
You do your job. It's really that simple.

224
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,845
Marty?

225
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,049
David, I can't talk with
you anymore about this.

226
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,215
Doc, please, I...

227
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,918
I'll submit my reports
at the end of the month.

228
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,527
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

229
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,061
Fuck!

230
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,211
Get the fuck down!
All you get the fuck down!

231
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,247
- Come here!
- Shit!

232
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,844
Get out of my way or the kid fucking dies!

233
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,022
You got to be fucking kidding me.

234
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,114
Is somebody gonna help me here? Fuck.

235
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,385
- Hey.
- Hey, back off!

236
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,923
You don't need to be doing this.

237
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,122
I'll blow his fucking
head off right fucking now!

238
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,731
Come on, now. No one has to get hurt.

239
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,533
Are you fucking deaf?
What's your problem? I'll kill him!

240
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,436
All right. Go ahead.

241
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:46,868
What are you doing?

242
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,270
I'm serious.

243
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,780
Oh, I believe you.

244
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,308
I'll do it.

245
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,650
Well, maybe you should.

246
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,223
Are you crazy?

247
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,591
Don't move.

248
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,236
Get this sack of shit off the floor!

249
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,170
Hands behind you, come on.

250
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,278
- You all right?
- You fucking hit me.

251
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,915
Hey, I saved your fucking life.
Stop your whining.

252
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,949
How did you know the safety was on?

253
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,621
- I didn't.
- I got to go to the hospital.

254
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,080
- Come on, you pussy.
- Fuck.

255
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:42,858
Here.

256
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,429
What the fuck is that for?

257
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,660
It's a tampon.

258
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,433
Stick it up your nose.

259
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,299
- I'll wait for you outside.
- Fuck.

260
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,198
Ed? Hon?

261
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,685
Mr. Ross?

262
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:41,681
Who's there?

263
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,817
I hope I haven't startled you.

264
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,057
Is Bill Ross around?

265
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,493
No. I'm his brother, Ed. Who are you?

266
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,161
Apologies.

267
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,930
I was under the impression
that the premises were vacated.

268
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,274
Name's John Lowery. I'm with DEC.

269
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,071
Department of Environmental Conservation.

270
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,414
We're out here investigating
reports of poaching in this area.

271
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,618
Your brother has given us permission
to set up a surveillance post here.

272
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,557
I take it this is your daughter?

273
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,726
This is my wife, Nancy.

274
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,357
And we're house sitting.

275
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,761
Bill didn't say anything to us about this.

276
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:23,866
Well, let me ask you. Have you...

277
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,899
seen or heard
anything out of the ordinary,

278
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,903
anything you might deem suspicious?

279
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,371
No. No, nothing.

280
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,310
Are you able to do something
about those local boys

281
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,380
always littering by the side of the road?

282
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,538
Nancy.

283
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,981
Well, Nancy, if I come across them,
I'll have a word.

284
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,315
You can count on that.

285
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,721
Look, the Department would be more
than happy to put you folks up

286
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,827
at a hotel for the night
while we go about our business.

287
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,054
Nonsense. We'll stay out of your way.
You go ahead.

288
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,424
No, no. I have to insist.

289
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,996
We don't wanna inconvenience you
any more than necessary.

290
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:02,002
No. Thank you. Save your money.
We'll be fine.

291
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:05,437
And if you know my brother, Bill,
you know he'd have my head

292
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,635
if I missed a night of feeding his fish.

293
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,412
All right then.

294
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,244
We'll just get ourselves set up.

295
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,916
Just one more thing.

296
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:26,327
The two of you,
you're out here alone, are you not?

297
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,321
Yeah, just us.

298
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:31,868
I can't tell you how happy
I am to hear that.

299
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,643
Service will be up in 20.

300
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,717
Finn's preparing the feeds now.

301
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,464
You fucking kidding me?

302
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,541
Nancy, you should have taken the hotel.

303
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,561
So how do we know we can trust these guys?

304
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,593
We don't.

305
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,294
Wanna come in for a beer?

306
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,360
No.

307
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,596
Right. I have some friends
coming over anyway.

308
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,271
Sure you don't want...

309
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,586
Okay. So I wanna talk
about this kid, Brody Walker.

310
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,384
Did anybody see that video of him
punching that dude in the face?

311
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,950
What is he thinking?

312
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,817
Been on TV and doing movies
as long as he has

313
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,453
and look at the way he's wasting his life.

314
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,620
Twenty years old and the kid
is a washed out has-been.

315
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,425
Walker falls out of the has-beens...

316
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,296
I don't why this Brody kid is still news.

317
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,902
He hasn't made a good movie in years.

318
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,663
This guy's doing nothing. He's a joke.

319
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,095
Shut up.

320
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,880
Come on, man.
It took me forever to get here.

321
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:43,633
Open up.

322
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,151
Please?

323
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,320
Come in.

324
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,662
I'll probably get my rims
stolen in this place.

325
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:05,373
You know, you look a lot better
when you smile.

326
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:12,920
So, do you have a wife
or a girlfriend or anything?

327
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,386
You ask a lot of questions, Brody.

328
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,754
And you like to avoid them all.

329
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,018
Mm-hmm.

330
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:30,605
Is this you?
This is some serious SWAT shit, man.

331
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:33,869
What are you doing here, kid?

332
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,338
I mean, seriously.

333
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,676
You have all these
amazing opportunities in life,

334
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,342
yet you keep fucking them up.
I mean, you're a goddam movie star.

335
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,283
Why are you blowing it?

336
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,515
What, you not happy?

337
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,550
You don't seem too happy yourself.

338
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,627
Well, that's what happens
when you get shot.

339
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,599
Look, here's the truth.

340
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,096
Okay? If I don't do this, I am done.

341
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:07,243
You think anybody gives a shit
about me if they're not making money?

342
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,711
At least you got a purpose.

343
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,146
You save people's lives.

344
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:14,779
Be a hero.

345
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,446
Be a hero?

346
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:20,814
There's nothing heroic about what I do.

347
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:24,756
I get paid to knock down doors for a living
regardless of what's on the other side.

348
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,760
If we happen to make a difference,
well, that's a good thing.

349
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:32,627
Do you?

350
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:34,763
Do I what?

351
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,334
Feel you make a difference?

352
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,301
I could ask you the same question.

353
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,408
Not that you really give a shit,

354
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:52,016
but this opportunity that I have,
this movie, is my last chance, man.

355
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,923
I know I've screwed up.

356
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,084
I pissed a lot of people off.

357
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,521
Do you have any idea
what it's like having the press

358
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,666
constantly knocking you down
no matter what you do?

359
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,794
No.

360
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,502
People only know what they see.

361
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:15,036
I'm being told what to do,
what to wear, who to date.

362
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,371
I don't even know who I am anymore.

363
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,182
But I know what I need.

364
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,315
And I need your help.

365
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,284
No more bullshit.

366
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:28,484
I promise.

367
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,189
Truce?

368
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,203
Let's take a drive.

369
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,475
Come on.

370
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,882
- Everything ready?
- Yeah. We're all good on our end.

371
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,052
Just make sure you're back online
the second that grid kicks back up.

372
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:07,526
We will be.

373
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,224
Ryker, Ben, synchronizing.

374
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:17,834
Five, four, three, two, one.

375
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,745
We've been driving for, like, an hour.
Where are we going?

376
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,181
I already told you.

377
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,288
No, all you said was, "You'll see."

378
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,515
Exactly.

379
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,225
See, this is why you
don't have any friends.

380
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,889
Hey, great to see you back, David.

381
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,294
- You too, brother.
- You're good.

382
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,931
Hey, I really appreciate this.

383
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,768
I think he's a good kid.

384
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,031
Stupid, but good.

385
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,232
It works for me.

386
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,080
Come on. Hey.

387
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,941
I'm gonna be giving you a visitor's badge.

388
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:06,249
It's the only way anybody,
other than staff, gels to go through.

389
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:09,656
I'm gonna need your ID
and your cell phone.

390
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,823
- My cell phone? Really?
- Yeah.

391
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,755
You too, David. I'm sorry.

392
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,426
Safety's on.

393
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,967
Two mags. You came prepared.

394
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,243
Welcome to the clubhouse.

395
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:43,657
The place was originally built in
the '50s as a meat packing plant.

396
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,761
Government bought it in the early '90s.

397
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,324
Retrofitted into a training outpost.

398
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,526
No nosy neighbors.

399
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,832
Are we a little light?

400
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,137
Yeah. The other team's got
recommissioned to the city.

401
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,869
- What, for that summit?
- Mm-hmm.

402
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,544
Central's got a tech unit on the way
to install some new feeds

403
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,342
so we can monitor everything.

404
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,210
Hendrix.

405
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,225
It doesn't count because spins,
we've gone over this.

406
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,724
- I know.
- As much as you want.

407
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,829
It's technique. I have a technique.

408
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,324
It is a score.

409
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,156
All right. Listen up, everyone.

410
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,333
He's back.

411
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:29,049
You kidding me?

412
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,663
- Are you back for real?
- Soon.

413
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,635
- How you doing?
- You knew about this?

414
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,370
- You look good.
- You must have known.

415
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,741
Who's this?

416
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:38,904
Scott Galloway, sir.

417
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,550
- Scott...
- Galloway.

418
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:41,741
Calloway.

419
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,079
Yeah, he'll be trained for this one.

420
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,222
He still doesn't know the difference
between a RIM5 and a rimjob.

421
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,993
Guys, this is Brody Walker.

422
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,760
You may have seen his penis on TV.

423
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,663
Brody. This is SRT5.

424
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,539
- Hey, I'm...
- Lesbian.

425
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,408
That's new information, Gina.

426
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:09,677
So, bro, I follow you on Instagram, man.

427
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,407
- Really?
- Yeah.

428
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,377
- What's her deal?
- You didn't hear? She's a lesbian.

429
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:16,744
Not for sale.

430
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,379
She is now.

431
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:21,582
Dick.

432
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:22,951
All right, I'm out of here.

433
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,091
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

434
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,591
What's his story?

435
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,222
I'm babysitting.

436
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:34,798
Last thing we need is for Bambi
to read the schematics of this place.

437
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,035
Nah. He's harmless.

438
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,776
Who's taking reign
in the killhouse this month?

439
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,482
You know, I don't wanna brag,
but I will. Fine.

440
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,744
Fifty-nine flat, 95 percent accuracy.

441
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,213
Here we go again.

442
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,783
It's not my fault you can't
keep up with the big boys.

443
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,283
Do you guys need me to pull up
my scores or what's happening here?

444
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,455
Is this a challenge?

445
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,761
- With you? No. It never is.
- Yeah.

446
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,825
What about you, boss? You feeling rusty?

447
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:06,561
I'm never rusty.

448
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,594
What's a killhouse?

449
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:11,632
Let's go show him.

450
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,993
What the fuck are you doing?

451
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,364
I'm thinking about getting a tattoo.

452
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:44,498
You were? Of what? A mermaid?

453
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,338
Jason, you're up.

454
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:11,795
Rookie.

455
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:20,801
Fuck.

456
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:10,222
- Hey, how you doing?
- About time you showed up.

457
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,855
I'm sorry. We got nailed over
at the 1-7 at midtown.

458
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,458
They told us they needed a quick fix.

459
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,861
Next thing you know they
wanted the Sistine Chapel in there.

460
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,093
All we want is finger painting.

461
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,077
- Identification and cell phones?
- Yeah, you bet.

462
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:30,972
Here you go.

463
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:50,923
Fellas.

464
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,838
Gentlemen, just gonna need to
take a look at your equipment.

465
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,443
Yeah.

466
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,363
Carl will tag along.

467
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,203
Your clearance level doesn't
permit you being unsupervised.

468
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,139
- We're all clear.
- All right.

469
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,873
Have fun, fellas.

470
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,342
Have a good one.

471
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,322
- This can't be right.
- Nice penmanship.

472
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,786
What are you, four?

473
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,186
No way. No.

474
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,724
We got to go again. Double or nothing.

475
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,728
- Double or nothing.
- Double or nothing. Yeah.

476
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:56,889
I'm gonna go take a piss. Is that cool?

477
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:58,894
Sure.

478
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,896
Upstairs to your left.
No wandering around.

479
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:04,897
Hold on.

480
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:10,302
Sully, I'm sending the kid up
to the head. Keep an eye on him.

481
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:11,974
Copy that.

482
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,910
No fucking sense. Four?

483
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,513
Come on then.

484
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,687
- Right away?
- Yeah.

485
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,017
You don't wanna stretch for your
sciatica, glass of water maybe?

486
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,333
Here we are.

487
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:55,120
We gotta disable all come. Do a hard
reset to patch in the new feeds.

488
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,624
Notify your HQ you'll be offline
for five minutes.

489
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,760
Hey, Sull. Get a call over to dispatch.

490
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:03,862
Tell them we'll be going offline.
These guys need five minutes.

491
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:05,793
Copy that call.

492
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,572
And come are down.

493
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,308
You wanna check Facebook while we're here?

494
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,740
Sergeant Maddox.

495
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,974
Take three of your men
and cover the front.

496
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,641
- Wait for my orders.
- Copy.

497
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,750
Let's move out!

498
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,742
Hey, man, we got a problem over here.

499
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,713
And like that I am in.

500
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,519
Powering down cameras in three, two, one.

501
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,788
What the hell?

502
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,073
Slow and steady wins the race.

503
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,782
Keep dreaming. Kid not back?

504
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:41,346
Not yet.

505
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,882
- Really?
- No.

506
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,519
Huh.

507
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,232
Shit.

508
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,530
Hey, kid.

509
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,972
You can't be wandering around here.

510
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,937
Sir, you should come take a look at this.

511
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,600
Sam, you all right?

512
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,094
I can't see shit. What happened?

513
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,795
Hey, kid. You hit?

514
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,168
What the hell was that?

515
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,685
Shit! I can't tell if he's breathing.

516
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:49,847
Stay with him.

517
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,659
Don't move!

518
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,270
Put the gun down!

519
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:08,967
Now!

520
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,479
You in there, get out here!

521
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,180
Show me your hands! I wanna see them now!

522
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,825
- Sully.
- Hey, over here!

523
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:35,729
Sully.

524
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,674
Code red. Code red!

525
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:44,473
Clear.

526
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,812
- Sully's down.
- What happened?

527
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,348
I don't know. Some kind of explosion.

528
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,077
Go.

529
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,078
Come on, kid.

530
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:55,850
Got any movement?

531
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:13,037
How many spotted?

532
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:16,345
Two, maybe three.
We got to get to Sully fast.

533
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,542
Oh, fuck that.

534
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,800
Moving.

535
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,360
Come on.

536
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,065
Hello and welcome.

537
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:46,700
Please follow these voice
instructions and call 911 now.

538
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,107
And remember, stay calm.

539
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,941
I am calm. Can't you tell?

540
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,807
And cameras are back up now.

541
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,951
Korver.

542
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,796
Hang in there, Sull. We got you, boss.

543
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,596
Firmly place paddles on patient's
chest and torso as illustrated.

544
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:16,934
No pulse detected.

545
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,999
- No pulse detected.
- No shit, Sherlock.

546
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,241
- What's the problem?
- Carnage.

547
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,007
Oh, shit.

548
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,647
Make the call.

549
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,484
- HQ, this is SRT head division.
- Sergeant Maddox.

550
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,488
Coms are back up and
everything's running smooth again.

551
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:40,185
Move in now. You copy?
I need my guys out of there.

552
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:44,922
Go!

553
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,468
Come on, Sully. I got ya.

554
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,334
I'm out!

555
00:43:58,536 --> 00:43:59,606
Shit, Sam's down!

556
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,548
System charging.

557
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:07,288
System charging.

558
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,325
- System charging.
- Come on.

559
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,695
Fuck!

560
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:25,196
Oh, fuck!

561
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:27,969
Is this your sick way of getting
attention, you narcissistic prick?

562
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,205
Get the fuck up!

563
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,710
Stay on me.

564
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:40,549
Holy shit!

565
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,028
Come on, Sully. I've got you.

566
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,504
What the fuck?

567
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,067
Move!

568
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,205
Let's move!

569
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,709
Let's go! Move out!

570
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:47,815
You okay?

571
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,217
Boss?

572
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:51,583
In here!

573
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,427
Fuck! Jesus Christ, man! I've seen enough.

574
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,793
Get me the fuck out of here!

575
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,728
We got to move.
We got to get him out of here.

576
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:07,904
Is everyone okay?

577
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,609
Sully's bleeding fast.

578
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,438
- Okay, put me down.
- You're all right.

579
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,776
Here, here, here.

580
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,009
Shit!

581
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:26,520
Sully, you got to hang in there, man.

582
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,427
I'm depending on you.

583
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,325
I knew I was getting
too old for this shit.

584
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,365
You're gonna be okay.

585
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,164
Somebody wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

586
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:38,766
EMP?

587
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:40,768
Yeah.

588
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:43,479
All right. Guys, we got to call for help.

589
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:45,544
Sully, where are the phones.

590
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,281
Don't bother. They're fried.

591
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,350
It's all burnt out.

592
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:54,456
Anything electrical that was
on during the blast is useless.

593
00:46:55,446 --> 00:47:00,020
The only power running through here
now is from the backup generator.

594
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,792
Hang in there, Sull.

595
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,227
We're fucked.

596
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:37,992
Think this is a coincidence.

597
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,101
The night before a major summit,
we get attacked and bumped offline.

598
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,329
That doesn't happen.
They must be after security, right?

599
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:44,666
They're not after security.

600
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,266
They must have had another objective.

601
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:49,575
You just worked that out now?

602
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,340
All right. I don't exactly wanna
stick around and find out.

603
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,741
You're staying put.
Any other exits besides the garage?

604
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,675
Yeah, but they're reinforced steel.

605
00:47:57,842 --> 00:47:59,219
There's no way they can lift those doors.

606
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,455
We'll find another way.

607
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,725
Sully, what do you
remember about these guys?

608
00:48:07,752 --> 00:48:09,197
Everything checked out.

609
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:12,961
Immaculate ID's precleared in the system.

610
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,805
Guys, I know I'm not exactly
the expert here or anything...

611
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:21,535
That's right, you're not. So just
shut up, and we'll figure it out.

612
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,268
If we've been knocked off the grid,

613
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,414
that should show up on
someone's monitor at HQ, no?

614
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:27,780
They would have planned for that.

615
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,210
We need to get an SOS out somehow.

616
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:32,547
How? Didn't he just say
everything was fried?

617
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:36,387
Old landline behind my desk.

618
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:41,123
It hasn't been plugged in for months,
but it could be of use.

619
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:42,991
Go check it out.

620
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,399
Brody!

621
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,066
Let him go.

622
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:00,649
You don't think this thing
is gonna make a difference, do you?

623
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:09,021
I guess the good thing is
I'll be dead before we find out.

624
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:33,079
Cigarettes will kill you, you know?

625
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:46,487
Got it.

626
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:48,552
Yeah?

627
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:52,962
Okay.

628
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,029
- Holy shit. I've got a dial tone.
- Thank God.

629
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,732
So, how do we do this?

630
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:03,003
What do you mean?

631
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:05,078
Well, have you ever called 911 before?

632
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:08,039
It kind of defeats the purpose
with our profession, don't you think?

633
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:09,980
- Who else are we gonna call?
- I don't know.

634
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,911
Don't you guys have like a secret
emergency phone number or something?

635
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,587
You actually look kind of sexy
when you're mad.

636
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,385
You guys are totally fucking, aren't ya?

637
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:21,922
Shut up.

638
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,500
911, what's your emergency?

639
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,765
This is Scott Calloway with
Strategic Response Team Five.

640
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:33,772
We have a code red. Several casualties.

641
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:35,376
We are in urgent need of backup.

642
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,676
What is your building access code?

643
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:41,415
Building access code is three,
alpha, five, seven, whiskey niner.

644
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,178
Copy that, Officer Calloway. Please hold.

645
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,787
Come on.

646
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,782
You're in SRT head division north?

647
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:52,621
Affirmative. We've got an unknown
number of hostiles in the area.

648
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,057
They are heavily armed.

649
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,230
All right, Calloway. Hold tight
while we divert a team your way.

650
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,892
When they arrive, identify yourself
with the code word Tallahassee.

651
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,129
If you're under duress, use Malibu.

652
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:05,740
Copy that. Dispatch EMS as well.

653
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,604
We've got an officer down.
He's got a gunshot wound.

654
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:11,375
I don't know how long he's got,
but you got to hurry.

655
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:15,245
Well, this don't look good.

656
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,380
Come on.

657
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,914
What are we dealing with?

658
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,082
Six or seven of them holed up.

659
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,586
Put up a bit of resistance,
but shouldn't be a problem for you.

660
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:33,123
For us?

661
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,836
My men are not equipped
for this level of engagement.

662
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,641
You brought us here
purely on a contingent basis.

663
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:42,937
You don't think this is the sort of
contingency you're being paid for?

664
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:45,336
Huh?

665
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:48,110
Merc pricks.

666
00:51:48,973 --> 00:51:50,509
Fucking mercs, I told you.

667
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:57,119
- Did you get it?
- Went to shit.

668
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,589
Some civvy was there,
botched the whole thing.

669
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:01,757
What about Dallas?

670
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:04,022
Shit.

671
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,457
Sir! Got to talk to you.

672
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,001
Sergeant Maddox.

673
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,667
Consider your rate doubled
for you and your men.

674
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:16,940
You got any guys who
are good with a scope?

675
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,438
Yeah, a couple.

676
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:20,604
You get them with the ground unit,
and you cover the gates.

677
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:24,542
One more thing.

678
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,018
Don't you ever try to
negotiate with me again.

679
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:31,284
Understand?

680
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:35,621
I got something.

681
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,799
It worked. CRT's on the way with EMS.

682
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:43,232
That's great.

683
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:45,137
Aren't you guys CRT?

684
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,501
We're SRT. CRT is NYPD.

685
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:50,305
- What's ERT?
- Canadians.

686
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,510
Jason, Scott, watch out front.

687
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:55,046
I don't want our boys
running into any surprises.

688
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:56,541
Right.

689
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,982
This is good, right?
We're getting out of here?

690
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,254
- That's the plan, yes.
- Yes.

691
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,052
What do you think they're after?

692
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:06,254
No clue.

693
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,255
Hey.

694
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,556
Hey.

695
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:14,895
- The door...
- What?

696
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:19,671
The door around the corner.

697
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,239
Yeah. This is where they took cover.

698
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:32,047
But it's just storage.

699
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,263
What are we even looking for?

700
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,734
Here, give me the flashlight.

701
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:39,815
Sully. What's with the room?

702
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,517
Supposed to be for archives.

703
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,792
I know what it's supposed to be.

704
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:48,756
But what's it for?

705
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:53,134
Sully, come on.
We've known each other forever.

706
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,501
A couple years ago...

707
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,340
Department of Justice
was trying to figure out

708
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:06,311
what to do with the assets
of high profile busts.

709
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:11,681
Evidence, lock-ups, OUCBs... ripped off.

710
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,454
We had to find some way
to make it more protected.

711
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,721
You telling me the government's been
hiding seized assets in police facilities?

712
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:27,627
I'm telling you they found a way
to move valuables around

713
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:31,332
off the books without anyone knowing.

714
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:32,997
Shit.

715
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:37,873
What we did is we took down
the next bad guy...

716
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:42,047
and the next and the next.

717
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,446
Think of it as a recycling program.

718
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:50,658
What if there's like
a nuclear bomb down there?

719
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,317
Chemicals and shit. Could they want that?

720
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,091
Let's ask him.

721
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:04,072
Hang in there, Sully.
You're gonna be okay.

722
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:05,529
Yeah.

723
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:15,174
Who are you? What do you want?

724
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:17,441
Who the fuck are you?

725
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:19,918
They're coming for you guys.
You don't stand a chance.

726
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:21,385
They ain't coming for you.

727
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:26,422
At the rate you're bleeding out, you'll be
dead in half an hour, less if I intervene.

728
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:28,527
Go fuck yourself.

729
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:31,757
Go fuck yourself.
Why do they all say that, huh?

730
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,602
What are you gonna do with that?

731
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,399
What's your objective?

732
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,737
Fuck you!

733
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:47,538
What's your objective?

734
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:50,150
You're wasting your time, asshole!

735
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:54,050
Fuck. What's he doing to him?

736
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:59,256
What's your goddam objective?

737
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,787
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

738
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:04,891
Fuck you!

739
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,302
- Sully.
- I can do this all day, pal.

740
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,168
Hey, Sully.

741
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,471
I didn't exactly plan it this way.

742
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,108
Oh, fuck.

743
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:27,646
I can't go on that long
fishing trip I been planning...

744
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,950
all those things I'll never see.

745
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,093
We're in position.

746
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,200
- Anything?
- No. I got nothing.

747
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:44,970
- I'll get it.
- Yeah, go.

748
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:48,699
Yeah?

749
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:50,640
SRT, this is HQ. Calloway?

750
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,109
Yeah, speaking.

751
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,271
We've got a mobile unit
moving in from the east.

752
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:55,974
You should see their
headlights any minute now.

753
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,782
- You got anything?
- Hold on.

754
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,888
Hey, Scotty. Scotty, we got lights.

755
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:13,395
Yeah. I think they're here. Thank you.

756
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:15,963
Good guys are here!

757
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,176
What are you laughing at?

758
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,146
I know you...

759
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:31,512
Hendrix.

760
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,852
Sully.

761
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,920
Hey, Sully.

762
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:43,993
Sully.

763
00:58:58,502 --> 00:58:59,606
Boss.

764
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:02,709
Boss.

765
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,854
Sorry about your friend.

766
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:19,560
Let's get out of here.

767
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,540
Please tell me they're here already.

768
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,434
SRT 5. Calloway?

769
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,793
I need you and your team
to identify yourselves.

770
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,174
Tallahassee. Let's do this.

771
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:07,567
Down!

772
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:27,593
Open up. Open!

773
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,166
Cease fire!

774
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,207
We're gonna need more men.

775
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,089
- How the hell did they know?
- I don't know.

776
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:04,297
I was there when Finn was on
the line. I thought they bought it.

777
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,396
That'll be enough.

778
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:09,598
Beg your pardon?

779
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:12,968
Take it easy, sergeant.
We got the advantage here.

780
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,143
With all due respect,
I've already lost four of my men.

781
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,240
You're short one.

782
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,550
And I don't know why you guys
are keeping things so tight.

783
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:25,753
Three hours from now,
the next shift arrives.

784
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,816
Odds are not in our favor.

785
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:31,718
With all due respect, sergeant,
you're not the one with the money.

786
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,990
Neither are you, sir.

787
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,833
You wanna tell me why I did that?

788
01:02:45,662 --> 01:02:46,732
Huh?

789
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,645
I did that because I don't have time to
stand around and argue semantics with you.

790
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:55,340
You are an insubordinate low level grunt.

791
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:58,779
You are a gun for hire.
This is my playground.

792
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:02,915
It's your job to make me happy and,
sergeant, you have failed to make me happy.

793
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:10,294
Oy, you've just been promoted.

794
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,191
What's happening?

795
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:49,166
It looks like they're
covering up the cameras.

796
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:52,965
They shouldn't even know
those things are active.

797
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:04,716
Get them on the line.

798
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,582
That's all of them.

799
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,492
I still don't understand how
they can monitor anything.

800
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:14,520
Let alone intercept telephone lines.

801
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:18,325
They just have to emulate the signal,
run a little interference.

802
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:23,868
If they disabled the cameras before the
blast, they could still be operational.

803
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:26,931
How did you know they weren't CRT?

804
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,100
- Hmm?
- How did you know they weren't CRT?

805
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:47,391
When I graduated from the academy,
there were six of us.

806
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:49,254
Our Call sign was "CALIBUS".

807
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,795
We did the nasty shit.
Shit that other units wouldn't touch.

808
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,028
A lot of fun.

809
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,136
But as the years went by,
things got unethical, out of control.

810
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:01,867
So I got out.

811
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,871
But the unit kept growing.

812
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:07,871
And I suspect this asshole...

813
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,582
is part of the same team.

814
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:19,892
No one else is gonna say it.
I guess I will.

815
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:22,759
Those are our own fucking guys out there.

816
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,823
Fantastic.

817
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,723
You have any idea who brought them here?

818
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:31,065
I have a good idea.

819
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,975
His name is John Korver, LCO.

820
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,742
About a month before I transferred out,

821
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:43,112
our unit took down a local kingpin
that was laundering money

822
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,082
through a mining company in Jersey.

823
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:48,080
We caught on to him. Made our bust.

824
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:50,656
But we lost a couple of guys.

825
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:52,624
Korver didn't take it so well.

826
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,356
He felt we were entitled
to a few extra zeros.

827
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:59,429
Just so happens our suspect was
rumored to be in possession of about

828
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:02,001
one hundred million in
Central American bearer bonds.

829
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,132
I knew the guy would never give them up.

830
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:08,098
But Korver, he took three fingers off
him by the time the feds showed up

831
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:09,868
and nearly lost his badge.

832
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,613
Those bonds are still out there.

833
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,612
From what I hear, he's been
looking for them ever since.

834
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:19,812
Now, if Sully's right about this place...

835
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,814
Then what better time to come after them

836
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,251
than when 90 percent of our
resources are in the city.

837
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,487
Sir.

838
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,243
- Yeah.
- Who am I speaking with?

839
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:54,387
Show me yours, and I'll show you mine.
What do you say?

840
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,213
Oh, you've got a sense of humor?

841
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,558
The door that my men were
attempting to breach, the one...

842
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:01,718
Yeah, the one with the keypad and ladder.

843
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:03,023
We know.

844
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:11,334
There's a room in the sublevel
right below you. Archive number one.

845
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:14,541
In that room, there's a locker.
Locker 974.

846
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:18,167
You will retrieve the contents of
that locker and bring it out to me.

847
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,837
We will remain 30 yards away, safety's on.

848
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:24,611
We will not approach until you have
resealed the door behind you.

849
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,011
Nobody else has to die.

850
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:29,289
You've got 20 minutes.

851
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,287
- What do you think?
- It's him.

852
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,127
What are you doing?

853
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,262
Reacquainting myself.

854
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:43,966
Brody, tear the cover off.

855
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:00,310
Ryker.

856
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,387
Holy shit.
That guy looks like Brody Walker.

857
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,223
Hendrix.

858
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,228
That's impossible, isn't it?

859
01:08:10,153 --> 01:08:12,133
Just what the hell are
you doing here, Dave?

860
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:14,960
Boss.

861
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:17,570
What's he doing? Is he going out?

862
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:18,831
Hey.

863
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,072
Boss. Are you sure you wanna do this?

864
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,268
Just keep my six. If anyone moves...

865
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:26,639
shoot them.

866
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:35,682
David.

867
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:37,953
Try not to get shot.

868
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:43,628
Hey, hey, hey. Help me shut the door.

869
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:03,845
Target is in sight.

870
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:24,198
Is that really you, Dave?

871
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:26,562
Hello, John.

872
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:28,402
Good to see you, old friend.

873
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:30,238
Been a long time.

874
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:32,973
Not long enough.

875
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,173
What the hell are you doing here?

876
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,814
Shouldn't you be sitting
behind a desk somewhere?

877
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,358
What's the matter? Don't you trust me?

878
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,552
You taught me better than that.

879
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,192
Well...

880
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:55,495
here I am.

881
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,398
So what's the plan?

882
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:00,434
You come out here to try to reason with me?

883
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:02,098
Something like that.

884
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:04,040
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

885
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:06,946
I want those bonds.

886
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,183
You know what they're worth.

887
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,584
You can still be in for say...
five percent

888
01:10:14,077 --> 01:10:15,613
if you make the right choice.

889
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,259
It was never ours to take.

890
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:27,799
We are entitled to that money.

891
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,937
We earned that money with our blood,
blood of our brothers.

892
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:36,109
The same brothers you turned
your back on and walked away from.

893
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,609
Hey, folks.

894
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,942
You might wanna pay attention here.

895
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,952
You even know who this man really is?

896
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,582
He burns his friends.

897
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:51,652
I want guarantees.

898
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:54,926
We give you what you want...

899
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:57,764
and you let us walk away.

900
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:00,998
What you've got is 12 minutes.

901
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:06,607
This conversation's over.

902
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:10,902
Come on.

903
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:13,473
Like I said...

904
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:17,841
good to see you, old friend.

905
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:26,286
Let him go.

906
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:34,026
Gina, cover the door. Kid, come with me.

907
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:48,437
Come on.

908
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,446
It's a big fucking hole.

909
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,025
Take that. Stay behind me.

910
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:09,631
This place stinks.

911
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:18,707
Creepy fucking place, man.

912
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:22,641
This is it.

913
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,831
Holy shit.

914
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:45,569
- Yeah.
- Don't touch anything.

915
01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:09,388
There it is. This is what they're after.

916
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:12,759
So we just hand it over. Live to
track 'em down another day.

917
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:15,561
Uh-uh. Something's not sitting right.

918
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,561
We still don't know if they're
gonna come in here guns blazing.

919
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,299
We don't.

920
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,270
But we got four minutes
to make a decision.

921
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:26,441
Can you guys give us a minute?

922
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:31,416
Are you serious?
You want us to give you a minute?

923
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:34,477
Go on.

924
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:39,051
Yeah, sure. We'll check the door again.

925
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,892
Okay, so hear me out.
Ever watch action movies?

926
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,075
My only concern is
what if they don't hand it over?

927
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:02,015
They're not stupid.
They've got no other play.

928
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:04,581
It's not their stupidity
I'm worried about.

929
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:06,811
You're crazy.

930
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,989
You know it's not going
to make a difference.

931
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:11,516
Tell me if I'm wrong.

932
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,050
Mr. Korver.

933
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,296
What the fuck is he doing?

934
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:05,011
Hendrix, you son of a bitch,
what are you...?

935
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,678
No.

936
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:20,384
No! No, you bastard!
You're burning my money!

937
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:28,167
You son of a bitch!

938
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:40,505
Everybody in that building dies.
Everybody!

939
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,750
Hold on. Fucking money's gone.

940
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:46,053
This has all gone too far.
It's not part of the plan.

941
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,846
Yeah, and they know
who's on the other side.

942
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,089
Do you wanna go down for this? I don't!

943
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:57,359
Get the canisters ready.
Get them! We're going in.

944
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:03,028
David.

945
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:06,137
David, for Christ's sake.

946
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,805
Gina, we need to take control
of the situation, fast.

947
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,273
What the hell is this guy doing?

948
01:16:11,634 --> 01:16:14,547
Look, I trust him. I just don't know
what his game plan is.

949
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:16,614
Look, he's been out of
commission for months.

950
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:18,274
We have no idea what his problem is.

951
01:16:22,478 --> 01:16:24,082
David. David!

952
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,154
Christ, David. What the hell
do you think you're doing?

953
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:29,459
They're gonna come in here,
and they're gonna kill us all.

954
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,129
They were gonna kill us anyway.

955
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:34,056
There's no way Korver could have
known about the bonds

956
01:16:34,223 --> 01:16:35,429
unless someone told him.

957
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,799
And I bet my life on it, it wasn't Sully.

958
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:39,470
You do realize what you're suggesting?

959
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,311
- So what, Bieber is out?
- Fuck you.

960
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:47,004
It's a question of probability.
The kid doesn't have a fucking clue.

961
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,108
And while I'm no saint...

962
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,648
You have more of a grudge
than anyone here.

963
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:53,849
Sully was close to retiring.

964
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,623
Yeah, I could use the extra money.
Wouldn't we all?

965
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,621
How many people go in and out
of that door every day?

966
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,660
Korver could have help on the outside.

967
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,958
- That sounds convenient.
- Shut the fuck up, kid.

968
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:08,102
This is the guy that
called the fake cops, right?

969
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:11,998
You know, other than Brody,
you are the only outsider here.

970
01:17:12,695 --> 01:17:13,935
You have the same access we do.

971
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:17,975
What are you saying, Gina?

972
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:20,372
Yeah, Scott.

973
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:23,175
How long have you been here?

974
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,513
This is bullshit. We're just gonna
start pointing fingers now?

975
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:29,053
Yeah. I'm pointing my finger at you.

976
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:30,551
Don't you fuck...

977
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:31,783
Hey, hey, hey!

978
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,166
- What's in your pocket, Scott?
- My dick.

979
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,892
You want me to surrender
that to Sully too?

980
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,403
- Empty them.
- Fuck you.

981
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,064
Fuck me? Empty your fucking pockets.
Do it now.

982
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:55,141
Come on.

983
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:56,681
Gina, get his gun.

984
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:02,215
Empty your pocket.

985
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:05,085
Just do it, Scott.

986
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:08,259
There's nothing in my...

987
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,193
Okay.

988
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:15,696
This isn't mine.
This isn't my fucking phone.

989
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,064
- Son of a bitch.
- That's not my phone!

990
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,570
He's been sending them information.

991
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,670
That's ridiculous.

992
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:29,879
Gina, he was with you guys
when you made the call.

993
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:31,881
Could he have picked it up then?

994
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,356
- Gina.
- It's possible.

995
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:38,887
He could have removed
the battery before the blast.

996
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:42,454
Tie him up.

997
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:45,462
If I'm gonna get shot tonight,
it's not gonna be in the back.

998
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:48,629
SRT 5.

999
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:51,468
You know protocol. On your knees.

1000
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:54,240
On your fucking knees!

1001
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:56,232
Don't test me.

1002
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:00,542
That's a good boy.

1003
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:05,211
Hey.

1004
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,877
Do you think we can use that
phone to get help?

1005
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,750
We can't risk it. They'll still be
intercepting calls from this area.

1006
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,164
Problem?

1007
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:30,770
Something you wish to share
with the rest of the class?

1008
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,613
No money to pay us is the problem.

1009
01:19:37,673 --> 01:19:40,677
You're still in this because
you got no other choice. We do.

1010
01:19:42,011 --> 01:19:43,149
Money's a problem?

1011
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:47,256
- Your name's Beck?
- Yeah.

1012
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:48,656
What's your first name?

1013
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:50,088
- Joe.
- Joe.

1014
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,927
All right if I call you Joe?

1015
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:55,330
- Sure.
- You just...

1016
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:57,468
you hang on one second, Joe, all right?

1017
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,602
Finn, get me Hendrix, will you?

1018
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:01,499
Hang on.

1019
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:11,649
SRT 5. Are you there?

1020
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:14,178
Hendrix.

1021
01:20:15,044 --> 01:20:16,148
It's Korver here.

1022
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:20,293
I want you to know that little stunt
you pulled isn't going to deter us.

1023
01:20:20,716 --> 01:20:22,718
In fact, it's quite the opposite.

1024
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,860
Now, it just so happens
that a couple of other fellows

1025
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,364
came to join the party.

1026
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:30,734
I'm standing here with
a fellow named Joe Beck.

1027
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:32,736
That's B-E-C-K.

1028
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,906
It's rude to speak over other people, Joe.

1029
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,213
Hendrix, I just want you to know
who's with me

1030
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:42,007
in case you need to know later.

1031
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,416
I'll be seeing you soon...

1032
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:47,546
old friend.

1033
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,684
So, now you got skin in the game too.

1034
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,931
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.

1035
01:21:05,594 --> 01:21:06,595
Check the kitchen.

1036
01:21:06,762 --> 01:21:09,368
Get as many bottles as you can
and some antifreeze from the garage.

1037
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:14,938
Owl's white smoke grenade.

1038
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:17,609
Deadly.

1039
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,546
What the fuck are you doing?

1040
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:26,719
This is yours.

1041
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:32,292
What am I supposed to shoot
with this, a fucking leprechaun?

1042
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,794
They're wearing vests.

1043
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,428
Aim for the face and knee caps.

1044
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:38,063
Point and shoot, right?

1045
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,938
Now you can. Ever fired a weapon before?

1046
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:47,074
Played a lot of video games.

1047
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,143
Are you fucking kidding me?

1048
01:21:52,775 --> 01:21:53,913
Jesus.

1049
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:57,384
So, you think I shot one of these, huh?

1050
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:03,962
You're ignoring me again?
Really? We're back to this?

1051
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:10,295
Fine. If they wear a vest,
aim for the knee caps.

1052
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,269
Hey.

1053
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,772
Oh, shit. Are you okay, man?

1054
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:22,908
Don't worry about me.

1055
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:25,345
I'm kind of relying on you
so I don't get killed.

1056
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:26,679
David!

1057
01:22:27,643 --> 01:22:29,520
David, we got a problem.
They're gassing us out.

1058
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:31,421
We got to move now.

1059
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,936
- Where are the gas masks?
- Everything's downtown.

1060
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,196
Fuck.

1061
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:47,868
- I need water.
- We got to hurry.

1062
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:49,441
- It's coming in fast.
- Come on!

1063
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,669
- Grab me some water.
- Here, here.

1064
01:22:52,835 --> 01:22:55,008
Pour it on. Pour it on the shirt.

1065
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:57,778
Pour it.

1066
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:01,543
All right.

1067
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:04,280
Just pour it. Pour all of it!

1068
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:05,982
- Here we go.
- All of it for Christ's sake.

1069
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:09,789
All right. You, stay put.
Jason, Gina, come with me.

1070
01:23:10,853 --> 01:23:11,957
I got it.

1071
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,866
All right.
I'll just wait in here, I guess.

1072
01:23:16,859 --> 01:23:18,133
Stay alive, kid.

1073
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:36,917
It's in the locker room.

1074
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,470
Brody.

1075
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:41,110
Locker room and storage are sealed.

1076
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:45,047
You got chlorine poison.
The gas is burning your lung tissue.

1077
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:47,423
- I need piss.
- Are you serious?

1078
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:48,721
Yeah.

1079
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:52,232
- Right.
- Gina, check him.

1080
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:54,590
Come on.

1081
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:57,569
Come on, kid. Hang in there.

1082
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:02,269
I know it's hard to breathe,
but stay with me.

1083
01:25:02,998 --> 01:25:04,909
Come on, Jason. Let's do this.

1084
01:25:05,067 --> 01:25:06,273
I'm doing my best.

1085
01:25:10,072 --> 01:25:11,949
Come on. You can do this.

1086
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,412
The gas should be clearing up by now.
Still need to hurry.

1087
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:19,623
Come on, Jason. Let's go.

1088
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:20,986
It's all I got.

1089
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:25,455
- Hold him down.
- No!

1090
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,093
No, no...

1091
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,438
You sure this will work?

1092
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,847
You know how fucked up this is, right?

1093
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:46,843
All right, bring him up.

1094
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:53,821
You all right?

1095
01:25:54,016 --> 01:25:55,552
What the fuck? Is that piss in my mouth?

1096
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:58,197
Yeah. And that piss neutralized the gas.

1097
01:25:58,353 --> 01:25:59,627
That's why you're breathing.

1098
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:00,994
I have piss in my eyes.

1099
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,032
Where the fuck did you
come up with this shit?

1100
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:04,329
I didn't.

1101
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,568
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah.

1102
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,668
All right, we're clear.

1103
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:12,309
Come on. We haven't got much time.

1104
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,747
- Ryker.
- Go ahead.

1105
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:19,685
That's a negative on the gas.

1106
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:38,454
Antifreeze.

1107
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,997
Alpha team is ready to engage,
waiting on Bravo.

1108
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:26,975
Okay. They are in position.

1109
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:28,539
Let's do it.

1110
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:32,180
David, slow down!

1111
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:34,146
Where are you going?

1112
01:28:34,843 --> 01:28:35,947
I can help you guys out there.

1113
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:38,284
When the police arrive,
I want you to remember John Korver,

1114
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:39,686
Ryker, Joe Beck and the vault.

1115
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:42,294
- I'm not gonna leave you guys.
- Kid, this is not gonna end well

1116
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,896
and someone has to tell the police
what happened. All right?

1117
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,391
Here.

1118
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,628
Get in.

1119
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:54,999
- Boss.
- Give me a minute.

1120
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:59,370
You did good today.

1121
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,173
Do you think I can make a good cop?

1122
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:02,371
No.

1123
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:05,310
Take care of yourself.

1124
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,548
David! Hey!

1125
01:29:07,876 --> 01:29:09,514
- Don't you think we could use him?
- David!

1126
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:11,351
We are. Just not for this.

1127
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:24,030
Oh, shit.

1128
01:29:26,995 --> 01:29:28,030
Guys.

1129
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,234
Guys!

1130
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:40,276
Get down!

1131
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:58,697
Hit it!

1132
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,367
Light it up!

1133
01:30:09,204 --> 01:30:10,274
Go!

1134
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:23,118
I can't be in this fucking thing.

1135
01:30:29,291 --> 01:30:32,170
Thanks, David,
put me in a fucking tin box.

1136
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:51,084
Oh, fuck.
I should have just went to prison.

1137
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:18,480
Get the door open!

1138
01:31:51,206 --> 01:31:52,412
Gina!

1139
01:31:53,475 --> 01:31:56,217
Go! Go! I'll draw their fire!

1140
01:31:56,378 --> 01:31:57,413
Come on!

1141
01:32:06,488 --> 01:32:08,229
Go, go, go!

1142
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:14,165
Covering!

1143
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:20,202
Covering!

1144
01:32:34,015 --> 01:32:35,085
Move up!

1145
01:33:31,306 --> 01:33:32,410
Go.

1146
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,691
Go on!

1147
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:04,943
Fall back!

1148
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:12,850
Die, you motherfucker!

1149
01:34:20,054 --> 01:34:21,795
Go, go!

1150
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:23,628
How you been doing, Davey? Been awhile.

1151
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:29,293
Tell me something.

1152
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,703
You still handing out
those parking tickets?

1153
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:37,599
You still sucking John's cock?

1154
01:36:06,094 --> 01:36:07,437
You know your problem, Hendrix?

1155
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:10,973
You never did wanna get your hands dirty.

1156
01:36:14,802 --> 01:36:17,612
Five years later, you're still soft.

1157
01:36:30,752 --> 01:36:32,322
You're still an asshole.

1158
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:22,140
Where's Gina?

1159
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:24,375
I don't know.

1160
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:25,977
Go find her.

1161
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:33,352
Thorough.

1162
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:08,091
Hey, douche bag.

1163
01:38:11,786 --> 01:38:13,026
That's disgusting.

1164
01:38:18,793 --> 01:38:19,897
You all right?

1165
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:22,199
Where's your vest?

1166
01:38:26,033 --> 01:38:27,410
Get out of here!

1167
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:41,887
Gina? What is she doing?

1168
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:52,130
That bitch.

1169
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:25,862
Shit.

1170
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,246
Dude, it was Gina.

1171
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:10,575
What?

1172
01:40:11,072 --> 01:40:13,018
Gina. She must have put the phone
in your pocket.

1173
01:40:13,808 --> 01:40:15,378
You can't trust chicks, dude. Believe me.

1174
01:40:15,543 --> 01:40:17,853
Next thing you know, your dick
ends up all over the internet.

1175
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,016
Watch out!

1176
01:40:32,059 --> 01:40:34,369
What the fuck, Gina? Why?

1177
01:40:36,097 --> 01:40:38,338
Why else? For the money.

1178
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,423
Boom! Played dead, bitch!

1179
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:05,630
Oh, shit.

1180
01:41:07,428 --> 01:41:09,066
I should get an Oscar for this shit.

1181
01:41:13,935 --> 01:41:15,243
That's fucking gross.

1182
01:41:21,309 --> 01:41:22,481
Kung Fu, bitch.

1183
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:48,573
Ah, shit.

1184
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,114
Lesbian my ass.

1185
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:31,286
Finn, we move out in ten.

1186
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:33,322
Wipe the hard drives. Kill the signal.

1187
01:42:33,848 --> 01:42:36,328
- We were never here.
- I may need more time.

1188
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:38,222
We don't have it.

1189
01:42:55,803 --> 01:42:58,306
What the hell are you doing here?
I told you to stay put.

1190
01:42:58,806 --> 01:43:00,217
Yeah, well, Scott and Gina are dead.

1191
01:43:01,409 --> 01:43:02,979
- What?
- No, it's okay.

1192
01:43:03,711 --> 01:43:07,022
Actually, it's not because
she deserved it and he didn't.

1193
01:43:08,482 --> 01:43:11,258
Never mind. Let me explain later.
Can we just get out of here, please?

1194
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:31,247
- You're shot.
- Yeah. Bad ass, right?

1195
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,542
It's a graze.

1196
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:38,213
You're such a pussy.
Let's get out of here.

1197
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:55,369
You still alive, Dave?

1198
01:43:56,097 --> 01:43:58,202
So you burned those bonds just to hurt me?

1199
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:00,139
Well, you did.

1200
01:44:01,202 --> 01:44:02,579
But I'll tell you something, my friend.

1201
01:44:03,571 --> 01:44:06,609
When you did, you sentenced
yourself and all your friends to die.

1202
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:41,617
Loudest sound in the world, Dave.

1203
01:44:42,476 --> 01:44:44,149
Slide locking back.

1204
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,571
Looks like you let
your team down again, Dave.

1205
01:46:17,872 --> 01:46:18,907
David!

1206
01:46:23,077 --> 01:46:24,249
David.

1207
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:28,420
David, you in there?

1208
01:46:32,253 --> 01:46:33,425
You okay?

1209
01:46:35,289 --> 01:46:36,427
Yeah, I'll live.

1210
01:46:42,897 --> 01:46:44,035
Oh, fuck.

1211
01:46:51,305 --> 01:46:52,545
How many did you get?

1212
01:46:55,276 --> 01:46:56,414
About 15.

1213
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:00,581
You?

1214
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:03,492
Yeah, about 15.

1215
01:47:07,221 --> 01:47:08,495
The kid?

1216
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:12,063
And Gina?

1217
01:47:12,993 --> 01:47:14,336
That's a long story.

1218
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:17,504
Come on.

1219
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:30,247
Brody.

1220
01:47:32,746 --> 01:47:33,850
Jesus.

1221
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:38,453
Fuck, those things hurt
almost as much as the real thing.

1222
01:47:39,954 --> 01:47:41,627
Why were you trying to hide this thing?

1223
01:47:42,756 --> 01:47:43,826
What?

1224
01:47:43,991 --> 01:47:45,629
I didn't wanna get shot in the knee caps.

1225
01:48:06,547 --> 01:48:07,890
Oh, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1226
01:48:09,016 --> 01:48:10,518
I'm so glad you guys are okay.

1227
01:48:11,051 --> 01:48:12,621
- Who the fuck is this prick?
- Wow.

1228
01:48:14,288 --> 01:48:16,495
- It got pretty crazy in there, huh?
- I don't know.

1229
01:48:16,657 --> 01:48:18,728
A lot of misunderstandings,
a lot of emotions,

1230
01:48:18,892 --> 01:48:21,168
a lot of things said
we probably didn't mean.

1231
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:23,137
- He's with them, right?
- You're okay.

1232
01:48:23,297 --> 01:48:25,868
Yeah, it looks like it.

1233
01:48:29,036 --> 01:48:30,208
Sixteen.

1234
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,907
Nice shot.

1235
01:48:54,661 --> 01:48:55,731
About fucking time.

1236
01:49:04,571 --> 01:49:07,575
This is SRT 5. This is SRT 5. Come in.

1237
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:11,416
I can't believe it.

1238
01:49:12,179 --> 01:49:13,852
All this for a bunch of money.

1239
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:17,893
Burnt to a goddam crisp.

1240
01:49:21,889 --> 01:49:24,062
Yeah, about that.

1241
01:49:25,526 --> 01:49:26,561
You're crazy.

1242
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,132
Tell me if I'm wrong.

1243
01:49:30,364 --> 01:49:32,139
You know that copier in the rec room?

1244
01:49:36,537 --> 01:49:37,777
It's got a lot of paper in it.

1245
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:03,904
How much did you take?

1246
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:08,674
How much did you take?

1247
01:50:09,636 --> 01:50:10,842
Maybe a little.

1248
01:50:11,638 --> 01:50:12,776
Define a little.

1249
01:50:13,807 --> 01:50:16,583
- More than you wanna know.
- Oh, fuck. Brody!

1250
01:50:20,747 --> 01:50:24,320
After surviving a near death
experience only one year ago,

1251
01:50:24,485 --> 01:50:27,694
actor, Brody Walker, is bouncing
back with his new blockbuster,

1252
01:50:27,921 --> 01:50:31,528
Gridlocked, which is set to take
the weekend box office by storm.

1253
01:50:31,692 --> 01:50:34,832
Walker is currently on a press tour
and has been garnering praise

1254
01:50:34,995 --> 01:50:38,533
for his portrayal of a rookie cop,
a role he is expected to reprise

1255
01:50:38,699 --> 01:50:41,111
in an already greenlit sequel to the film.

1256
01:50:41,268 --> 01:50:43,214
Ben has the exclusive interview.

1257
01:50:44,438 --> 01:50:47,009
Brody Walker, how you been, man?
It's good to see you.

1258
01:50:47,174 --> 01:50:50,121
Nice to see you too, Ben.
I'm doing well, thank you for asking.

1259
01:50:50,544 --> 01:50:51,818
I've got to ask you.

1260
01:50:51,979 --> 01:50:55,653
It was about a year ago that you found
yourself in quite a bit of trouble.

1261
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:59,987
A few run-ins with the law,
a number of rumors about you.

1262
01:51:01,288 --> 01:51:03,199
These things had to have
an impact on your career.

1263
01:51:04,958 --> 01:51:06,164
I was in a dark place, man.

1264
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:09,534
It was dark. And...

1265
01:51:10,464 --> 01:51:14,344
But, you know, I'm feeling
better now and Brody's back.

1266
01:51:15,135 --> 01:51:16,910
So no more troubles with the law?

1267
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:18,140
No.

1268
01:51:18,305 --> 01:51:19,375
No more violence?

1269
01:51:20,407 --> 01:51:21,545
No more drugs?

1270
01:51:22,843 --> 01:51:24,481
- Nobody's perfect, Ben.
- Right.

1271
01:51:24,978 --> 01:51:28,551
Okay, so you're going through this
rough patch and then all of a sudden

1272
01:51:28,715 --> 01:51:30,160
you find yourself in the middle of...

1273
01:51:31,051 --> 01:51:33,691
I guess we got to call it
a surreal experience.

1274
01:51:34,154 --> 01:51:36,566
Walk me through that.
What was that like for you?

1275
01:51:36,723 --> 01:51:41,105
Well, when you're staring death in the
eyes, and it's staring back at you...

1276
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:43,397
it's scary.

1277
01:51:43,931 --> 01:51:45,205
Even for Brody Walker.

1278
01:51:45,365 --> 01:51:47,538
I just kept on thinking to myself,
"It's not my time.

1279
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:48,873
It's not my time.

1280
01:51:49,403 --> 01:51:51,781
There's thousands of fans
depending on me."

1281
01:51:53,006 --> 01:51:55,452
I guess I got to wonder with
everything that's happened

1282
01:51:55,609 --> 01:51:59,615
over this past year, have you been
able to take those experiences

1283
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:02,055
and use them to shape your character?

1284
01:52:02,583 --> 01:52:03,687
Absolutely.

1285
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:07,559
I mean, I think it sewed as
the basis of my performance.

1286
01:52:09,523 --> 01:52:12,766
You know that they actually strapped
me down and waterboarded me?

1287
01:52:12,926 --> 01:52:15,270
- They waterboarded you?
- Yeah, waterboarded me.

1288
01:52:15,929 --> 01:52:17,806
- It's a form of torture.
- Yeah.

1289
01:52:18,265 --> 01:52:19,608
Except they used urine.

1290
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:25,742
They pissed in my mouth,
which brings me to my book,

1291
01:52:25,906 --> 01:52:29,046
In the Line of Fire, that's gonna
be on shelves later next week,

1292
01:52:30,377 --> 01:52:33,290
which will get into a lot more detail
of all the stuff that happened.

1293
01:52:33,714 --> 01:52:35,921
I mean, the director said
he wanted to use apple juice.

1294
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:37,460
I said absolutely not.

1295
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:39,556
I wanted the real thing.

1296
01:52:39,953 --> 01:52:42,957
And again, in the mouth.

1297
01:52:43,123 --> 01:52:44,966
You can't duplicate urine.

1298
01:52:45,993 --> 01:52:48,906
From where you were to where we are today,

1299
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:54,511
is there anybody who deserves
a thank you for getting you here?

1300
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:58,149
Well, Ben, actually there is.

1301
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:02,311
I know he's not gonna admit that
he's watching this right now, but...

1302
01:53:03,010 --> 01:53:05,991
David, I know you're out there.

1303
01:53:06,146 --> 01:53:07,648
I know you're watching this right now.

1304
01:53:07,814 --> 01:53:09,293
Why are you not returning my calls?

1305
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:11,156
I took a bullet for you,
you son of a bitch.

1306
01:53:11,918 --> 01:53:14,159
Call me back. I left all these voicemails.

1307
01:53:14,321 --> 01:53:16,665
He doesn't even call me back
anymore, Ben, this guy.

1308
01:53:17,291 --> 01:53:18,827
I took a bullet for you!

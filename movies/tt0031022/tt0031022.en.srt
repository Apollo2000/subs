1
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,266
Gentlemen of the jury, have
you decided on your verdict?

2
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,768
We have.

3
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,687
The prisoner will rise.

4
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,650
Do you find the prisoner guilty
or not guilty of willful murder?

5
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,360
According to the evidence,
we have no choice

6
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,154
but to find the prisoner
not guilty.

7
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,575
So do we all find
and may god forgive us.

8
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,037
Prisoner, at the bar
you have heard the verdict.

9
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,957
Under the law,
no other verdict is possible.

10
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,461
Yet, it is undoubtedly
a gross miscarriage of justice.

11
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:13,298
It is deplorable, Professor
Moriarty, that a man of your
intellectual attainments

12
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,844
should be standing in the
prisoner's box charged with
a crime of murder.

13
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,766
And in setting you free, I cannot
in my conscience exonerate you.

14
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,685
Let the prisoner be discharged.

15
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,899
[Pounding on door]
Let me in, let me in.

16
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:31,942
My Lord.

17
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,323
My lord,
I have important new evidence.

18
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,534
You come too late, Mr. Holmes.
The prisoner has been discharged.

19
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,287
But my lord, you can't let
Moriarty go free. He killed Loray.

20
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,497
I can prove it.
I can destroy his alibi.

21
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:49,001
That alibi has been
established by three hundred
fellows of the Royal Society.

22
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,461
Your lordship,
my client has been acquitted.

23
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,089
He cannot be tried twice
for the same charge.

24
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,100
Oh, there you are, Holmes.

25
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,727
I'm afraid you have
a bad opinion of me.

26
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,146
On the contrary, I hold you
in the highest esteem

27
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,481
but only as a maid.

28
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,692
It's gratifying to know that
one's talents are appreciated

29
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,069
by such a distinguished
connoisseur.

30
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,364
- May I give you a lift?
Cabs are scarce in this rain.
- Thank you.

31
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,496
- 221 Bakers Street.
- Very good, sir.

32
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,915
- After you, my dear Holmes.
- By no means,

33
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,042
I prefer that you precede me
at all times.

34
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,127
Such a creature of habit,
you are.

35
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,472
You have a magnificent brain,
Moriarty. I admire it.

36
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,476
I admire it so much I'd like to
present it pickled in alcohol
to the London Medical Society.

37
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,811
That would make an
interesting exhibit.

38
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:56,610
Holmes, you've only now barely
missed sending me to the gallows.

39
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,071
You're the one man in England
clever enough to defeat me.

40
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,406
The situation
has become impossible.

41
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,283
Have you any suggestions?

42
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,494
I'm gonna break you, Holmes.

43
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,162
I'm going to bring out
right under your nose

44
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,581
the most incredible crime
of the century

45
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,417
and you'll never suspect it
until it's too late.

46
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:17,798
That will be the end of you,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

47
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,718
And when I've beaten and ruined
you then I can retire in peace.

48
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,845
I'd like to retire,
crime no longer amuses me.

49
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,933
I'd like to devote my remaining
years to abstract science.

50
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,149
Well, here we are
at my lodgings.

51
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,443
I'm so sorry
I can't ask you in.

52
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,404
Good night,
Professor Moriarty.

53
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,905
Good night.

54
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:50,038
??

55
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,283
I was just coming in
when you rang, sir.

56
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,453
- Oh, there you are, Dawes.
- Mr. Bassick is here, sir.

57
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,121
I'll see him at once.

58
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,873
Come to me
as soon as he's gone, Dawes.

59
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,750
There's something
I want to say to you.

60
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,418
Yes, sir.

61
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,074
Well, Bassick.

62
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,954
Don't that bloke never stop.

63
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,915
That music gives me the creeps.

64
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,543
Does it, Bassick?
I rather like it.

65
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,421
I want you to post that letter
at the box at Portland Square

66
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,049
just a few minutes
before twelve.

67
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,803
Then drive directly to your
lodgings by way of Oxford Circus.

68
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,764
Wait there till I send for you.

69
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,724
That's all.

70
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,226
First, I want to know
what I'm getting into.

71
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,852
You have your orders.
That's enough.

72
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,980
I have a right to know the
layout in case there's trouble.

73
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,400
I'll take care of that.

74
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,486
That's what you promised Higgins
in that Hammersmith job.

75
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,155
Oh, poor Higgins.

76
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,990
They found nothing
but his boots.

77
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,992
One boot.

78
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,620
You know, Bassick,

79
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,998
Higgins was a valuable man
and a clever cracksman.

80
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,043
But he had your unfortunate habit
of asking too many questions

81
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,630
and now all that's left of him
is one boot.

82
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:08,760
Don't take me wrong, Professor.
I'll do what you tell me right enough.

83
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,804
I'm sure you will, Bassick,

84
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,516
and just to prove how I trust you
I'm going to tell you my plan.

85
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,270
Although, you haven't the imagination
to appreciate its subtlety.

86
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,524
My whole success depends upon
a peculiarity of Holmes brain,

87
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,443
its perpetual restlessness.

88
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,736
Its constant struggle
to escape boredom.

89
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,447
Holmes again?

90
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,991
Always Holmes until the end.

91
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,952
He's like a spoiled boy
who picks watches to pieces

92
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,664
but loses interest in one toy
as soon as he's given another.

93
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:43,170
So, I'm presenting the ingenious but
fickle Mr. Holmes with two toys,

94
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,173
in the order in which
I mean him to have them.

95
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,384
The first, that letter.

96
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,680
If I know Mr. Holmes that will
interest him very little,

97
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:59,352
after this comes to fascinate
and tantalize his imagination.

98
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,148
Blimey, what it mean?

99
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:08,528
That is what I'm depending upon
to absorb Mr. Holmes' interest
while I'm engaged elsewhere.

100
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,656
I'll give him a toy
to delight his heart

101
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:16,369
so full of bizarre
complications that he'll forget
all about the first toy,

102
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,913
that letter.

103
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,542
What's in the letter,
Professor?

104
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,546
The germ of a crime, Bassick.
A truly great crime.

105
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,757
A crime that will
stir the empire,

106
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,843
that children will read about
in their history books

107
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,638
and you're going to be
part of it, Bassick.

108
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,897
Off with you now.

109
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,837
You wanted to see me, sir?

110
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,297
I'm away for a few weeks,
Dawes,

111
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,508
and I come back to find
my emfurium magenta,

112
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,303
my incomparable emfurium magenta
withered, ruined.

113
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,764
I can't understand it, sir.
I take good care of all the plants.

114
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,392
- Did you water them?
- Every day, sir,
just as you told me, sir.

115
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,477
Then how did it happen
that I find a spider's web

116
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,688
spun across the spout
of a watering can?

117
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,774
- That can happen overnight, sir.
- Overnight, uh.

118
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,194
Then you didn't water
them today.

119
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,321
There has been so much to do,
sir, preparing for your coming
back and all.

120
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,407
Nothing is as important
as the care of my flowers.

121
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,409
Through your neglect
this flower has died.

122
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,578
- You've murdered a flower.
- I'm sorry, sir.

123
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,164
And to think that for
merely murdering a man

124
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,499
I was incarcerated for six whole
weeks in a filthy prison cell.

125
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,626
A pity, sir.

126
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,544
- A travesty on justice.
- Quite so, sir.

127
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,546
But for this crime, Dawes,

128
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,549
you should be flogged,
broken on the wheel,

129
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,343
drawn and quartered.

130
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,511
- Yes sir, will that be all, sir?
- And boiled in oil.

131
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,598
Thank you, sir.

132
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,600
- Go away.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,908
Well Billy, when you finish
sweeping you can dust.

134
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:00,867
Yes, ma'am.

135
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,431
- Well, good morning, Dr. Watson.
- Good morning, Mrs. Hudson.

136
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,308
Is Mr. Holmes in?

137
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,267
- Go right up, doctor.
- Ah good.

138
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,310
Is he busy?

139
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,480
Well you might say he was busy

140
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,107
- and then again,
you might say he was not busy.
- Huh?

141
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,776
Say he was busy,
not say he was busy...

142
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,531
Well, well, well, well, Billy.

143
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,408
That's a fetchy little froth
that you're wearing.

144
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,243
Mrs. Hudson made me put it in, sir.

145
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,453
I was afraid Mr. Holmes
or you would see me.

146
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,163
I think it's very becoming.

147
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,378
Come in, Watson.

148
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,684
I trust I don't come
inopportunely.

149
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,853
My dear fellow,
as if you ever could.

150
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,813
Come on, pull up a chair.

151
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,606
As a matter of fact, you're
just in time to help me decide

152
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,567
a matter that is certainly delicate

153
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,863
- and possibly of the
greatest importance.
- Of course, anything I can do.

154
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,365
I received this note
last night.

155
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,451
"My dear Mr. Holmes.

156
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,619
I'm taking the liberty of
calling on you at eleven
o'clock tomorrow morning."

157
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,204
That's very soon now.

158
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,083
"To ask you what may appear
a silly question

159
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,044
whether or not I should go to
a garden party on Saturday
at Lady Conyngham's.

160
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,045
I beg you to see me. I'm in
desperate need of advice.

161
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:40,383
Sincerely yours, Ann Brandon."

162
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,469
What you make of it, Watson?

163
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,763
Somebody's pulling your leg.

164
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,307
No, no, no.
I checked on the young lady.

165
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,768
She lives in town with her brother.
She's very rich, mining fortune.

166
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,811
Her father died somewhat
mysteriously about ten years ago.

167
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,063
As for Miss Brandon's dilemma,

168
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,399
Lady Conyngham is
imminently respectable

169
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,027
but she gives the kind of
parties that one comes away
from with a feeling

170
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,945
that one hasn't been anywhere.

171
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,865
Oh, how can you trifle with
such inconsequentialities

172
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,992
when Moriarty's lose on London?

173
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,036
My dear Watson, you astound me.

174
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,039
It's the very
inconsequentialities of
Miss Brandon's message

175
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,373
that engages my interest.

176
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,501
But Moriarty, what of him?

177
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,296
I've taken the most efficient steps
of keeping in touch with Moriarty.

178
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,673
- You're having him followed.
- Oh, don't be so crude, Watson.

179
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,301
Well, what are you doing?

180
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,220
Nothing.

181
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,473
Nothing?

182
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,808
My dear Watson,
you needn't check me back
as if I didn't have a voice.

183
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,684
I said "Nothing."

184
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,230
That's the best thing I can
possibly do at the moment.

185
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:40,485
Moriarty is as curious about
my movement as I am about his.

186
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,112
So, I sit here and wait
for him to come to me.

187
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,990
And he'll come.

188
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,909
Never doubt it.

189
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,285
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

190
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,121
So, you fiddle
while Rome burns.

191
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,832
A daring metaphor, Watson.

192
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,875
And what are you doing
with that inferno fiddle,

193
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,546
with those flies?

194
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,923
I was observing the reaction
on the common housefly
of the chromatic scale.

195
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,677
- A brilliant experiment.
- Yes, it will be,

196
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,054
if I can find a note
that annoys the housefly

197
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,056
then might need
only play that one note

198
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,434
and psst
all the houseflies disappear.

199
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,019
- Amazing.
- No, no, no.

200
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,146
Elementary, my dear Watson,
purely elementary.

201
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,274
(Knock at the door)

202
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,651
I expect that will
be the young lady.

203
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,904
On the contrary,
I suggest an elderly gentlemen

204
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,490
with perhaps a touch of
gout in his right leg.

205
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,329
Sir Ronald,
I'm delighted to see you.

206
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,874
How do you do, Holmes?

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,458
- Let me take your hat
and stick.
- Oh, thank you, yes.

208
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,712
I don't think you know
Dr. Watson, do you?

209
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,298
Watson, this is
Sir Ronald Ramsgate,
Constable of the Tower of London

210
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,674
where all he has to do is to keep
his eyes on the Crown Jewels.

211
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,176
How do you do, sir?

212
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,846
Holmes has often
spoken of you, Dr. Watson.

213
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,723
You haven't dropped in like this
for a long time, Sir Ronald.

214
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,016
Won't you sit down
and have a cup of tea?

215
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,017
Thank you no, no.
I've come to consult you

216
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,936
on a rather peculiar matter.

217
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,147
Now just have a look at that.

218
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,858
- Doesn't it strike you
that the handwriting is --
- Yes, yes.

219
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,820
That's because it's
written with the left hand.

220
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,198
"Star of Delhi will never reach
the Tower of London."

221
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,576
Huh. Curious,

222
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,161
and anonymous.

223
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,913
And what is the Star of Delhi?

224
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,748
Probably the largest
emerald in the world,

225
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,375
a gift to her majesty
from the Maharajah of Rapur.

226
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,669
Oh, I shouldn't worry
about this, Sir Ronald.

227
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,797
It's a typical crank letter.

228
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,965
Besides, no professional thief would
risk stealing so famous an emerald.

229
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,383
You can't break it up.

230
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,095
He certainly couldn't
sell it as it is.

231
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,764
Perhaps not but in my position of trust
I can't afford to take any chances.

232
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,558
I wonder whether you could
possibly manage to be on hand

233
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,310
when the jewel is delivered.

234
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,228
- Now when will that be?
- This weekend.

235
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,941
It's coming on the
cruiser Invincible.

236
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,818
Oh, Sir Ronald, even though I'm
convinced that the threat means nothing

237
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,195
and that a routine police guard
would be quite adequate,

238
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,739
you can depend on me.

239
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,950
Thank you. Now I feel sure
the jewel will be safe.

240
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,410
Little enough to do for you,
Sir Ronald.

241
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,162
[Knock on the door]

242
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,129
Excuse me.

243
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,098
I don't know what
you must think of me

244
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,641
but I'm sure
I was followed here.

245
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,934
- You are Miss Brandon?
- Yes.

246
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,603
- I am Sherlock Holmes.
- Yes, I know.

247
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,355
- Let me introduce you to
my associate, Dr. Watson.
- How do you do?

248
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,606
Sir Ronald Ramsgate.

249
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,484
Mr. Holmes, I...I--

250
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,862
Well, I've got what I wanted,
so I think I'll be going along.

251
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,239
Good day, Miss Brandon.

252
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,700
- Goodbye, doctor.
- Goodbye, sir.

253
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,368
- Your hat and stick,
Sir Ronald
- Thank you.

254
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,912
- I'm depending on you.
- I'll not fail you.

255
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,955
I'm sure of it.

256
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,581
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

257
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,801
Yes, Miss Brandon?

258
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,137
I shouldn't have written you
as I did, Mr. Holmes

259
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,348
and then burst in, in this
melodramatic way but I had to see you.

260
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,852
Oh, that doesn't matter,
Miss Brandon.

261
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,353
There's no more resolutely
informal household in all of
London than mine.

262
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:06,024
- You're very kind.
- Not at all.

263
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,984
Only I don't understand why
you wish to consult me about
a garden party.

264
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,778
You couldn't possibly find a
worse guide to social etiquette.

265
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,864
It's because my brother
and Gerald Hunter.

266
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,323
He's the family solicitor.

267
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,201
He insist on my going
and I don't want to.

268
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,495
I don't want to.

269
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,457
Yes, but how should I know how
to advise you, Miss Brandon?

270
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,710
Perhaps you should do as
your brother and family
solicitor suggests.

271
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,130
Lady Conyngham is
imminently respectable.

272
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,341
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
I'm so frightened.

273
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,761
What are you frightened of,
Miss Brandon?

274
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,222
Murder.

275
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,477
Sit down, Miss Brandon.

276
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,192
Now suppose you tell us
all about it.

277
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:54,072
Well, this came for my
brother, Lloyd, in the post
two days ago.

278
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,545
Hmm.

279
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,797
This seems to be a field day
for crank messages.

280
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,298
Look at that, Watson.

281
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,634
Huh? Curious.

282
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,969
May the 11th, that's today.

283
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,140
My father received just such a
note before he was murdered.

284
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,225
Murdered?

285
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,018
Murdered.

286
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,646
Ten years ago on May the 11th.

287
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,273
Scotland Yard
couldn't make anything of it.

288
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:34,904
But I saw him, my father,
lying there on the pavement

289
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,948
with the back of his head all--

290
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,083
Now tell me, Miss Brandon,

291
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,502
do you associate May the 11th
with anything else besides your
father's death,

292
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,254
I mean, perhaps with some other
incident in your family history?

293
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,799
No, no nothing.
My family has no history.

294
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,676
My father was a self-made man.

295
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,261
I see.

296
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,304
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
you must save my brother.

297
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,014
Don't let them kill him
as they did my father.

298
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,975
[Knock on door]

Jerrold?

300
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,239
It was very wrong for you
to come here, Ann, after I
expressly asked you not to.

301
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,576
No more so
than for you to follow me.

302
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,870
- Where's the paper
you took off my desk?
- Here in my hand

303
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,123
and I'll keep it until
I find out what it means.

304
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,167
I apologize for the intrusion,
gentlemen.

305
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,961
My name is Hunter.

306
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,505
I'm a legal representative for
Miss Brandon's brother.

307
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,841
That note was placed
confidentially in my keeping.

308
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,719
It's of no concern to anybody
except Mr. Brandon and myself.

309
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,181
Murder is a concern of every
right-minded person, Mr. Hunter.

310
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,516
You make too much of a trifle.

311
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,976
There's is nothing trifling
about murder.

312
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,478
Miss Brandon fears this
drawing may be a threat.

313
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,564
Oh, she's been reading
too many novels.

314
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,610
It's merely some kind
of joke or the work of a
mental incompetent.

315
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,486
Isn't it true, Mr. Hunter,
that Miss Brandon's father

316
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,781
received such a drawing
before he was killed?

317
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,034
Since my client attaches no
significance to that, Mr. Holmes,

318
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,493
I don't see why you should.

319
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,995
It's pure coincidence.

320
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,665
Yes.

321
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,001
But it would be unfortunate
if the coincidence turned into
a tragedy, wouldn't it?

322
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,921
That is our responsibility,
Mr. Holmes.

323
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,839
I regret that you've been
troubled. I'll send you a
check for your fee.

324
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,966
As of yet there is no fee.
I haven't accepted the case.

325
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,303
You see, Ann, you've only made
yourself ridiculous.

326
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,224
Well, if Mr. Holmes won't help
me I'll go to Scotland Yard.

327
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,683
Don't you trust me, Ann?

328
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,560
But Jerrold there's
too much at stake.

329
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,731
- My brother's life.
- Darling, you must trust me.

330
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,067
If you don't
what's to happen to us?

331
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,654
I don't know, Jerrold.
I dare think.

332
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,576
I've decided to accept
your case, Miss Brandon.

333
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,788
I shall help you all I can.

334
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,873
- Oh, thank you.
- We don't want your
interference, Mr. Holmes.

335
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,416
I interfere whenever and
wherever I like, Mr. Hunter.

336
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,918
I think you better go, Jerrold.

337
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,837
- Come with me.
- No.

338
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,881
Very well,
if that's how you want it.

339
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,260
Good day, gentlemen.

340
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,929
Am I being very foolish,
Mr. Holmes?

341
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,430
I don't think so.

342
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,766
- May I keep that note?
- Yes, of course.

343
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,689
It struck me that Mr. Hunter
behaved rather curiously.

344
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,440
Yes.

345
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,942
He's my fiancי.

346
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,153
I understand that.

347
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,488
You have no idea what kind of bird
this is supposed to be, have you?

348
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,033
I don't know anything
about birds.

349
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,744
I noticed that it isn't just a
bird. It's a definite kind of bird.

350
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,706
I think it belongs to the
Procellariiformes family.

351
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,375
We should go to the Kensington
Museum and look him up

352
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,711
and I'd like you to come
with me, Miss Brandon.

353
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,546
Oh yes, yes of course,
anything you say.

354
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,964
[Knock on door]

355
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,465
Come in, Billy.

356
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,680
- Yes, Mr. Holmes.
- Now Billy, I'd be obliged

357
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,389
if you'd take this young lady
down to Mrs. Hudson and
give her a cup of tea.

358
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,891
Yes, Mr. Holmes.

359
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,893
- Then Billy I want you
to get me a cab.
- I know, sir.

360
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,855
Not the first, not the second
cab in the line but the third.

361
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,898
I don't think that precaution
would be necessary in this case

362
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,150
- but use your own judgment.
- Yes, sir.

363
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,152
- And by the way, Billy.
- Yes, sir?

364
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,739
When you found that cab,

365
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,490
you might remove the dust
that you kicked under the rug
on the landing.

366
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,207
Billy's studying to take
over my duties when I retire,
Miss Brandon.

367
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,751
I'll join you below
in just a few minutes.

368
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,169
I don't know how to thank you,
Mr. Holmes.

369
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,837
Oh, please don't try.

370
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,555
Holmes, you can't get involved
in this case.

371
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,640
Your duty is to guard
the Star of Delhi.

372
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,101
- Now what?
Oh, bother the Star of Delhi.
- What?

373
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,228
Here's a case where a
man's life may be involved

374
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,939
and there's something grotesque
about this business.

375
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,401
The young Hunter knows
a great deal more than he
proposes to tell.

376
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,819
Find out what you can
about him, will you, Watson

377
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,906
and report to me at the museum.

378
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,574
- It's time for lunch.
- Lunch?
One can have lunch anytime.

379
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,617
Oh, go on, Watson.
Please hurry up.

380
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,295
You are certain there was no
one unearthed a grievance

381
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,880
against your father
or your family?

382
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,592
No, I've told you. My brother
and I live very quietly.

383
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,553
My father, well I admit
he was a hard man

384
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,808
but men who go out into
new worlds have to be
but he was honorable and fine.

385
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,643
And Mr. Hunter?

386
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,354
We've known each other
ever since we were children.

387
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,981
My brother and I have always
trusted him completely.

388
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:25,069
Tell me, have you ever through
your family or Mr. Hunter

389
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,947
heard the name of
a man called Moriarty?

390
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,281
Moriarty?

391
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,825
No.

392
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,826
You're quite sure?

393
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,037
Quite.
Why do you ask?

394
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,958
Somehow, I have the feeling of
renewing an old acquaintance.

395
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,459
Here we are.

396
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,671
Procellariiformes,
west wing, section 4-A.

397
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,832
I'm sure everything
will be taken care of
to your satisfaction.

398
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,750
I depend upon you implicitly.

399
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,502
Well, there'll be no difficulties.

400
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,200
Lloyd.
I thought you were asleep.

401
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,702
How can I can sleep
with this threat over me?

402
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,996
We've got to do something
about it, Jerrold.

403
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,664
Who's that man here just now?

404
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,999
A client.

405
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,584
Who was he?

406
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,169
See here, old man.

407
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,962
You mustn't let yourself
go like this.

408
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:11,091
I know. I've been so nervous.

409
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,552
I haven't slept a wink
since that note came.

410
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,179
You've got to sleep

411
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,014
if you're to keep
your wits about you.

412
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,227
This is May the 11th,
the day on the paper.

413
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,479
He's going to kill me, Jerrold.

414
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:27,858
Wherever I go,
whatever I do,

415
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,778
he's going to kill me.

416
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,197
Is there nothing
anyone can do about it?

417
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,623
Why don't you go home
and go to bed.

418
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,917
Can't do yourself any good
pacing my office.

419
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,212
Now the safest place in
London for you just now
is your own home.

420
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,755
Perhaps you're right.

421
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,842
Anyhow,
I can't go on like this.

422
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,805
I'll go home.

423
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,723
You'll come with me, Jerry?

424
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,226
I'm afraid I can't, Lloyd.

425
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,520
Probably wouldn't matter.

426
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,855
If anything should
happen to me,

427
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,941
you'll look after Ann,
won't you?

428
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,819
Don't be absurd. Nothing's
going to happen to you.

429
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,446
But if it should.

430
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,074
You know how I feel about Ann.

431
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,660
Goodbye. Thanks.

432
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,203
You'll be alright, Lloyd.

433
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:25,457
I think it's just a bad dream.

434
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,794
I think I'll walk home,
get some air.

435
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,506
And why not? Nothing can happen
to you on a public street.

436
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,551
I hope you're right.

437
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,844
Goodbye, Jerrold.

438
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,596
Goodbye, old man.

439
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,538
See the beak, the nostrils,

440
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,332
the whole formation of the body
is the same.

441
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,125
In sea lore,
the companion of ships

442
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,085
and the good old
men of honest mariners

443
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,838
but an angel of destruction
to those who do him ill.

444
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,215
The albatross.

445
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,302
It looks the same.
I wonder what it means.

446
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,304
Are you certain that the
albatross doesn't suggest
some memories,

447
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,180
some association with
your family? Think.

448
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,806
I am thinking.

449
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:26,101
No, the only thing
it reminds me of is the poem.

450
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,021
"Water, water everywhere

451
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,690
and all the boards did shrink.

452
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,902
Water, water everywhere,

453
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,906
- nor any drop to drink."
- You've hit on it!

454
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,784
"And instead of the cross,

455
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,579
the albatross
about my neck was hung."

456
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,375
This is no childish prank,
Miss Brandon,

457
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,751
but a cryptic warning of
avenging death. We must go
to your brother at once.

458
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,504
- Holmes, Holmes.
- Come on Watson, quick.

459
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,547
But Holmes, this is important.

460
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,848
Well, Watson, you're bursting with
news. What it is man speak up.

461
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,267
We've no secrets
from Miss Brandon.

462
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,478
- Moriarty.
- I knew it.

463
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,939
What have you found out,
Watson.

464
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,774
That fellow Hunter
is working for Moriarty.

465
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,317
They were together
in Hunter's office.

466
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,403
- I watched Moriarty leave.
- Excellent.

467
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,070
And what did
Mr. Hunter do then?

468
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,405
I don't know.

469
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,449
You don't know?

470
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,660
No, I came away directly
to tell you what I discovered.

471
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,998
- Have I done something wrong?
- I hope not.

472
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,419
I particularly wanted
Mr. Hunter's movements
kept in view today.

473
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,920
Sorry?

474
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,797
- Mr. Holmes?
- Yes, Miss Brandon?

475
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,842
Regardless of appearances, don't
condemn Jerrold too quickly.

476
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,261
I know he's keeping
some secret from me but

477
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,805
he could never do anything
vicious I'm sure.

478
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,808
I trust you're right,
Miss Brandon, but we must be
on our guard.

479
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,894
And I was gonna say, Holmes--

480
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,982
Well, what were you
about to say, Watson?

481
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,233
Nothing.

482
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,778
Watson?

483
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,613
Yes.

484
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,950
I'm afraid you're an
incorrigible bungler.

485
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,662
Afraid I am.

486
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,683
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
I wish he could go faster.

487
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,935
He's going as fast as he can,
my dear.

488
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,838
[Screaming]

489
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,678
Will we be in time?

490
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,721
I'm sure we will,
Miss Brandon.

491
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,856
He's dead all right.

492
00:30:58,982 --> 00:30:59,523
Lloyd!

493
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,402
Lloyd.

494
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,621
Yes?

495
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,748
Oh, Mr. Holmes.
Can I give you a hand, sir?

496
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,458
No, thank you,
I can manage all right.

497
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,506
- Oh, Miss Ann.
- She's only fainted.

498
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,884
Take care of her,
will you, Watson?

499
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,844
- Get me some smelling salts.
- Yes, sir.

500
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,846
- Where's Inspector Bristol?
- In there.

501
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,348
I don't think
you ought to go in.

502
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,308
He's questioning a witness
and you know the inspector.

503
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,143
I'll take responsibility.

504
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,607
Oh, it's you, Mr. Holmes.

505
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,276
How do you come to be here?

506
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,235
I just happened to be passing.
I know the family.

507
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,570
How are you, Mr. Hunter?

508
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,823
And you, inspector?

509
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,366
I don't know how much
you know about this business,
Mr. Holmes,

510
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:55,245
but this time,
I'm a little bit ahead of you.

511
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,206
Excellent, Bristol. Then you've
already solved the crime?

512
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,791
I found the murderer.

513
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,543
Yes, but that's not quite
the same thing you know.

514
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,546
I didn't kill Lloyd Brandon.

515
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,131
Has anyone said you did?

516
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,176
Oh, it's plain enough
what's in the inspector's mind.

517
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,720
And he's wrong.

518
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,805
Well he's wasted time badgering
me the murderer's got away.

519
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,517
Well, if you're so anxious
to save my time

520
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:20,062
supposing you explain
how you came to be found

521
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,440
bending over the corpse
with this in your hand

522
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,526
and him with his
head bashed in?

523
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,989
Well, if you won't talk,

524
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,993
I'm gonna hold you on
suspicion of murder.

525
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,372
I didn't kill him, I tell you.

526
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,041
You clubbed him to death
with the butt end of this
revolver from behind.

527
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,460
I wouldn't go too far
along that line, Inspector.

528
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,338
And what would you propose
that I should do, Mr. Holmes?

529
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,966
- Find the murderer?
- Find--

530
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,928
If that man didn't club Lloyd
Brandon to death, who did?

531
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,430
Nobody.

532
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,556
- What?
- Brandon was strangled
to death.

533
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,977
- Strangled?
- Yes.

534
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,561
The wounds to the back of his head
were administered post-mortem.

535
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,897
- Are you sure of it, Mr. Holmes?
- Absolutely.

536
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,733
Talk to the medical examiner
if you have any doubts.

537
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,654
You wait here.

538
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,865
How do you know
he was strangled?

539
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,993
The marks around the neck.
Cigarette, Mr. Hunter?

540
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,912
No thanks.

541
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,831
So, that blow on the back
of the neck becomes an
interesting element.

542
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,542
It was unnecessary,
therefore vicious.

543
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:29,089
Intelligent criminals are
seldom vicious except on
special occasions.

544
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,383
Though the apparent method
of the crime was brutal,

545
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,137
I'm convinced that the crime
itself was intelligently planned.

546
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,472
And Bristol thinks I did that.

547
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,684
The nose of a police dog,
although long and efficient,

548
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,478
- points in only one
direction at a time.
- What do you mean?

549
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,148
Simply that you're
the obvious suspect.

550
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,774
It's so ridiculous.

551
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,444
Why should I want to kill him?

552
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,405
You should know that better
than anyone else, Mr. Hunter.

553
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:57,534
You're his lawyer.
You manage the estate.

554
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,453
You'll have to explain that,
Mr. Holmes.

555
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,705
The Brandon estate
is quite considerable.

556
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,332
Miss Ann inherits and
you're about to marry Miss Ann.

557
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,587
- Why you --
- I was merely demonstrating
how the police mind works.

558
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,797
Yes, I'm afraid our
friend the inspector

559
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,009
has quite set his heart
on arresting you.

560
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,677
Arresting me?

561
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,846
You mustn't allow them
to do that, Mr. Holmes.

562
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,474
I must be let free
to protect Ann.

563
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,642
From what, Jerrold?

564
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,024
Answer me.

565
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,574
Ann, I'm sorry.

566
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,286
First they murdered
my father and

567
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,706
now they've murdered Lloyd.

568
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,459
Do they want to kill me too?

569
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,045
I don't know.

570
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,546
I don't know anything anymore.

571
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,215
I did my best to guard him
day and night

572
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:56,843
yet they found him all the same
there in an empty street.

573
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,931
Oh, I may have lost him for
a moment but I couldn't have
been far behind.

574
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,225
Who are they?

575
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,647
Jerrold you're lying.

576
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,482
You've been lying
all the time.

577
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,859
You knew from the first
that note was a real threat.

578
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,113
That's why you tried to send me
away, why you followed Lloyd.

579
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,740
Oh Jerry,
if you know who killed him
why won't you tell us?

580
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,868
Why won't you
tell us everything?

581
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,746
I'll tell you why.

582
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,581
I've been watching you,
Mr. Hunter

583
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,792
- and I found out --
- What have you found out,
Dr. Watson?

584
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,712
Whatever Watson has found out
you'll know inevitably.

585
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,382
I have unbounded confidence
in his lack of discretion.

586
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,635
Meanwhile, time presses
and we've work to do outside
before it gets too late.

587
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,720
- Mr. Holmes.
- Excuse us.

588
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,560
You pushed me out of the room
as if I were a child.

589
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,354
What am I to make of this,
Holmes?

590
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,314
Anything but such a petulant
face, old fellow. Come along.

591
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,984
In another moment
I would have made him
confess about Moriarty.

592
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,111
That's exactly
what I didn't want.

593
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,572
If Moriarty's behind this case,
Hunter will lead us to him.

594
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,616
Well, Mr. Holmes,
I just coming to find you, sir.

595
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,286
Have you seen the body?

596
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,414
He was strangled to death,
just as you and I thought.

597
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,375
So, now I'm gonna arrest
this fellow Hunter,

598
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,002
take him down to the yard.

599
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,629
I can really question him there

600
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,923
and I thought perhaps
you'd like to come along, sir.

601
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,425
No, I think not, inspector.

602
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,926
Dr. Watson and I
are going across the way

603
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,928
to take a look at the
scene of the crime.

604
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,847
You'll be wasting
your time, sir.

605
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,640
My men have already
covered the ground.

606
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,852
Well, we'll just take a look
all the same.

607
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,271
Incidentally, inspector, if I were
you I shouldn't arrest Mr. Hunter,

608
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,606
in any case not now.

609
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,025
Nor, I shouldn't question him
any further.

610
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,693
- Why not?
- Well, it won't get us
anywhere.

611
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,778
He won't talk until he's ready.

612
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,281
Anyhow you haven't a case
against him yet.

613
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,283
Why not leave him at large.

614
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,452
Have him watched
and see what happens,

615
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,538
- for a day or two at least.
- Hmm.

616
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,791
You've always found my advice pretty
sound, haven't you, inspector?

617
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,669
It's got you a lot of attention
in the newspapers.

618
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:58,006
Then you'll work on the case,
sir? In the usual way?

619
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,966
In the usual way, inspector.

620
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,676
I'll do as you suggest, sir.

621
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,428
Good.
Come along, Watson.

622
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,312
Come in.

623
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:14,898
Oh, Mr. Hunter,

624
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,067
we shan't be wanting you
any longer.

625
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,985
You're free to go
whenever you like.

626
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,987
Thank you, inspector.

627
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,699
You see, darling, they don't
think anything of the kind.

628
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:28,370
Ann, you must believe me.

629
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:38,797
I don't know what to believe
anymore that Lloyd's gone.

630
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,840
If I can't believe in you,
Jerrold,

631
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,551
there's nothing in the whole world
I can believe in or count on.

632
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,428
My dearest.

633
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,935
But if you knew
Lloyd was in danger

634
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,855
why did you try to keep me
from seeing Sherlock Holmes?

635
00:37:55,982 --> 00:38:00,902
Why did you follow Lloyd
with a revolver in your pocket?

636
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:04,489
Makes me afraid sometimes
even of you.

637
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:09,244
Darling, how can you
say such a thing?

638
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:14,874
Oh, I don't know
what I'm saying.

639
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,752
I'm so tired and confused.

640
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,757
All right, Holmes.
I found it.

641
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,517
Ready when you are.

642
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,532
I say there,
has something happened?

643
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,909
Definitely.

644
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,161
Would you mind moving
back a few paces?

645
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,496
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

646
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,210
Perhaps I can find a doctor.

647
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,588
I'm a doctor.
What's the matter with you?

648
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,591
I'm all right.
I was thinking of you.

649
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,843
Why?

650
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,888
But aren't you ill?

651
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,598
Certainly not.

652
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,974
I'm dead.

653
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,481
Well, I'm afraid
I must be getting on.

654
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,191
Don't let me detain you.

655
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,903
Stupid fellow.

656
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,199
Watson, come here.

657
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,700
Coming, Holmes.

658
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,584
Look at that, Watson.

659
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,378
What have you found, Holmes?

660
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,421
- Footprints?
- Yes.

661
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,050
A club-footed man about
five foot eleven I should say

662
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:50,261
from the length of his stride.

663
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,971
Do you observe anything
singular about these
footprints, Watson?

664
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,100
I can't say that I do.

665
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,519
Club-footed people invariably
bring their full weight down
on the toe.

666
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,687
If you look closely you'll
observe that the weight
of the man

667
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,980
who made these footprints
is normally balanced from
toe to heel.

668
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,982
Well what can you
make of that, Holmes?

669
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,736
Oh, just one more unnatural element
to this rather peculiar case.

670
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,447
The clubfoot must have some
other compensating deformity

671
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,408
- to explain these footprints.
- What?

672
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,326
You think these are the
footprints of a murderer?

673
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,912
It's possible.

674
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:19,082
Yes, yes it's quite possible.

675
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,835
What, Holmes?

676
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,670
Well a man standing just
about here would command
a view of the path.

677
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,464
He might project
some kind of weapon.

678
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,675
Not a weapon's been found
except Hunter's revolver.

679
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,093
It could easily have been
retrieved in the excitement.

680
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,553
And what kind of weapon
thrown from here

681
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,971
could both strangle a man
and crush his skull in?

682
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,514
If we knew that,
my dear Watson,

683
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,267
we'd be a great deal nearer
to the solution of the crime.

684
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,736
Look at that.

685
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,072
Yes.

686
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,199
Yes, it was torn
from that tree.

687
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:56,411
Perhaps by something
hurdling past.

688
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,996
The sap's not dry yet.

689
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,915
That means it was torn off
within the last few hours.

690
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,544
Ah.

691
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,045
What have you found,
Holmes?

692
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,755
It's a watch fob.

693
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,257
Looks like a rabbit's foot.

694
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,967
No, no, no. It's chinchilla.

695
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,427
Unquestionably chinchilla.

696
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,888
Well, rabbit or chinchilla.
What's it matter?

697
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,433
What? No, no. Perhaps it
doesn't matter at all, Watson.
We'll see.

698
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,686
I've always thought those
things were in very poor taste.

699
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,981
Fancy going about
with a dead animal's foot
dangling from your pocket.

700
00:41:25,107 --> 00:42:14,405
Yes, and then loosing it
at the scene of a murder.
Very careless.

701
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:20,495
??

702
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,721
(Scream)

703
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,870
She's in here, sir.

704
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,747
- Who is it?
- It's Mr. Holmes.

705
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,461
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
I'm so glad you're here.

706
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:55,340
This may sound foolish to you
but after Mr. Hunter left

707
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,759
I went up
to be with my brother.

708
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,136
While I was with him
I heard--

709
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,679
Yes?

710
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,640
The sound of music
from the street,

711
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,018
strange music.

712
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,562
It didn't begin,
and it didn't end.

713
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,272
It just went on and on.

714
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,317
What was it about the music
that frightened you?

715
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,445
I heard it once before,
Mr. Holmes,

716
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:21,491
only once when I was a
little girl in South America,

717
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,242
the night my father was killed.

718
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,620
It's quite possible that
under the circumstances

719
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,663
this impression
was a hallucination.

720
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,791
This was no hallucination,
Dr. Watson.

721
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,667
Take my word for it.

722
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,629
Did you see who was playing?

723
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,631
I went to the window.

724
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,759
There was a street beggar
standing in front of the house.

725
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,720
I could just see the outline
of his figure

726
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,516
- and then I became so
frightened I screamed and--
- Yes I don't wonder.

727
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,899
Do you think you would
remember that melody?

728
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,567
Remember it,

729
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,195
I should never forget it
as long as I live.

730
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,532
Miss Brandon,
I wish I could spare you this
but time is so important.

731
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,826
I understand.
What do you want me to do?

732
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,411
It's not going to be easy.

733
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:11,666
Anything if it will help you
clear up my brother's death.

734
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:15,711
Do you think you could bear
to repeat it for me?

735
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,630
I'll try.

736
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:38,067
??

737
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,052
That's definitely
every note of it.

738
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,308
Mr. Holmes, would you mind
going out, please?

739
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,143
Yes. Yes, of course.

740
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,021
You must try to get some
sleep. It's been a terrible
day for you.

741
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:32,371
??

742
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,344
Thank you, Billy.

743
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:55,394
??

744
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,231
What's that, Mr. Holmes?

745
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:01,192
Hmm? Yeah, that's a
chinchilla foot, Billy.

746
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,944
- Chinchilla?
- Yes.

747
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,112
You know what a chinchilla is?

748
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,407
Yes, Mr. Holmes.
It's a little animal that grows
in South America

749
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,076
and its fur is very expensive.

750
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,577
Ah, you should
remember that, Billy.

751
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:14,038
It'll save you a lot of money
when you grow up.

752
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,540
May I look at it, sir?

753
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,000
- Uh, yeah, yes, certainly, Billy.
- Thank you.

754
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,505
- Well, what do you
make of it, Billy?
- Blimey,

755
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,006
I'd like to have one of these.

756
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,424
They must bring you
lots of luck.

757
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,467
Well why do you say that?

758
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,344
Well, I bet in Chile or Bolivia

759
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,721
they carry around a
chinchilla's foot for good luck

760
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,015
- the same as we
carry a rabbit's foot.
- Ha, ha.

761
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,308
You hear that, Watson?

762
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,979
My hearing is in no way
impaired, thank you.

763
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,856
And you think that the man
who lost this comes from
Chile or Bolivia?

764
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,901
Yes, sir, cause that's the
only places chinchillas grow.

765
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,236
Well, Watson.

766
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,654
What do you say to that
for a simple deduction?

767
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,574
I've listened to seashells
that made better sense.

768
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,742
Why do you waste your time
like this, Holmes?

769
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,579
- Half the women in the world
own chinchilla wraps.
- You exaggerate, Watson,

770
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,289
and half the women in the
world wish you didn't.

771
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,500
No, Dr. Watson. You see they
make the coats out of skins.

772
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,168
- Oh, really?
- Yes, sir,

773
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,962
and the only place you can
get a chinchilla's foot

774
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,131
would be where
the chinchilla lives.

775
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,716
There Billy,
there's sixpence for you.

776
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,926
Blimey me a tenner.
Oh, thank you.

777
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,262
No, thank you, Billy.
Thank you.

778
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:18,060
I don't know why you let
that insufferable little brat
come in here.

779
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:21,188
I was pulling your leg, Watson.

780
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,441
Merely relaying to you through
Billy certain observations,

781
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:27,820
which may or may not
coincide significantly with
what I found.

782
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,698
- You found something?
- I think so.

783
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,533
I've identified
the death music, Watson,

784
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,578
the melody Miss Brandon
played for us last night.

785
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,164
It's an ancient Inca
funeral dirge

786
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,916
still used by the Indians
in the remote Chilean Andes

787
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,877
as a chant for the dead.

788
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,838
What on earth has that got to
do with Professor Moriarty

789
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,173
or the Star of Deli?

790
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,467
I wouldn't know, Watson.
I really wouldn't know.

791
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,802
(Knock at the door)
Would you mind?

792
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,598
Inca funeral dirge...

793
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,852
- Ah, how do you do, doctor.
- How are you, sir?

794
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,355
Holmes, how lucky
to find you at home.

795
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,775
Sir Ronald.
Well, won't you sit down.

796
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:09,070
- Here you are, sir.
- Thanks.

797
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,364
- Oh, I hope I'm not
interrupting you.
- Oh, no, no, no.

798
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,948
But I'm very anxious to know

799
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,035
have you had any idea, in the
connection with that note?

800
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,620
The note?

801
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,246
Oh, I'm afraid I haven't had
much time to think about it.

802
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,999
After all, the Star of Deli
is not the immediate problem.

803
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,584
Oh, but it is.

804
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,628
You will help me as you
promised, won't you Holmes?

805
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,673
Imagine the scandal,
if anything should happen
to a Crown Jewel.

806
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,007
Yes.

807
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,802
- When does it arrive?
- Tomorrow night.

808
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,179
I've had to arrange
for delivery at ten o'clock,

809
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,598
a most inconvenient hour
for everyone of course

810
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,643
but I can't leave
the jewel out of the vault
overnight, you know.

811
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:44,647
- Once it arrives
it's technically in my custody.
- Yes.

812
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,692
Yes, I understand.
What do you want me to do?

813
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,570
Could you possibly be at the
tower tomorrow night at ten?

814
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,155
- I'll take care of everything.
- Good.

815
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,865
You'll have your own men there,
of course,

816
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,534
and as an added precaution
I'll see to it

817
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,744
- that a few policemen
are on hand.
- Excellent.

818
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,955
I can't tell you, how
grateful I am to you, Holmes.

819
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:01,956
Not at all, Sir Ronald.

820
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,290
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

821
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,959
You'll forgive me
bothering you like this.

822
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,586
But I'm sure you understand
the emergency of the matter.

823
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,922
- Certainly, Sir Ronald.
- Thank you again.

824
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,841
- Goodbye, doctor.
- Goodbye, Sir Ronald.

825
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,436
- How do you do, Miss Brandon?
- How do you do?

826
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,229
Will you excuse me, please?

827
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,693
Port Authority, pier nine.

828
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:38,701
Giddy up.

829
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,331
Miss Brandon,
is anything wrong?

830
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,833
Two are not enough.

831
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:52,214
They don't even give me time
to bury my dead.

832
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,050
- Please, sit down.
- No, I don't want to sit down.
Thank you.

833
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,344
This is exactly like the
drawing your brother received

834
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,929
and it bears another date,

835
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:00,681
May the 13th.
That's tomorrow.

836
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,141
Was this left at your door?

837
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,059
Yes, about half an hour ago.
I came here directly.

838
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,020
You didn't happen to notice
the messenger who left it?

839
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,813
No, one of the servants
answered the door.

840
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,025
He just took it.
He didn't notice anything.

841
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,944
Mr. Holmes, what shall I do?

842
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,239
Isn't May the 13th the night
you're supposed to go to
Lady Conyngham's party?

843
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:20,493
- Well yes, but --
- I know Lady Conyngham
is irreproachable but

844
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,870
there's too much emphasis
on this date, May the 13th,

845
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,705
whether you should go to the
party or whether you shouldn't.

846
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,166
You mean Jerrold?

847
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:31,337
Miss Brandon,
we feel that...forget it.

848
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,219
Mr. Hunter has much to explain,
Miss Brandon.

849
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,095
As yet he's not been
proved guilty.

850
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,555
But I must know.

851
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,933
You really want to know?

852
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,810
I must.

853
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:50,356
I'll do anything rather
than bear this uncertainty,
the suspense.

854
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,359
Then go to
Lady Conyngham's party.

855
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:57,863
But I can't, not now.

856
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,824
- After Lloyd--
- I understand your feelings

857
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,867
but you must go to
Lady Conyngham's just the same.

858
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:04,662
She's an older woman.
She's very fond of you.

859
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,622
Now you're alone
in a time of trouble.

860
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,333
What more natural
than that you should go to her?

861
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,169
But she's giving a party
and my brother's--

862
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,171
You only have to
make an appearance.

863
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,422
Yes, but --

864
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,675
That's what I want,
Miss Brandon.

865
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,635
I want you to make
an appearance,

866
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,887
perhaps take a walk
through the grounds.

867
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,306
I warn you it may involve
considerable risk

868
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,058
but I think the kind of woman
I take you to be

869
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,185
would rather risk everything
on one venture

870
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:33,065
than live the rest of her
life in the shadow of doubt
and death.

871
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,608
Am I right?

872
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,360
You are right, Mr. Holmes.

873
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,153
I'll do as you say.

874
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,989
Thank you and goodbye.

875
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,575
No.
This time we'll say au revoir.

876
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,954
- Miss Brandon?
- Yes.

877
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,875
Are you quite sure
you're not afraid.

878
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,252
Of course I'm afraid
but I'll go through with it.

879
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,712
Good.

880
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,764
May the 13th.
That's tomorrow night.

881
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:09,143
Well Holmes, you've certainly
let yourself in for a busy
night tomorrow.

882
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,937
What about the Star of Deli
and you promise to Sir Ronald

883
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,772
and what about your duty
to The Crown?

884
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,275
All that will be taken care of.
Never fear.

885
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,277
I'm going to delegate
the most dependable man I know

886
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:21,363
to guard the Star of Deli in
my place while I keep an eye
on Miss Brandon.

887
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,408
Oh really, who may that be?

888
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,785
You, my dear fellow.

889
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,870
What?

890
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,672
You'd like to let that razor
slip, wouldn't you, Dawes?

891
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,799
No, sir.
By no means, sir.

892
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,927
You're a coward, Dawes.

893
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,348
If you weren't a coward
you'd a cut my throat long ago.

894
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,475
Why I give you my word, sir.

895
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:54,271
That thought never
entered my mind, sir.

896
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,024
Then you're worse than a
coward. You're a fool.

897
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,110
You have as much hatred for me
as I have contempt for you.

898
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,075
Excellent.

899
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,369
Without your beard, sir,
you look like your own son.

900
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,049
It's unlikely that
I shall be back tonight, Dawes.

901
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,342
You may as well
take the evening off.

902
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,844
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Dawes.

903
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,148
I'm engaged.

904
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,818
Of course you are, Bassick. Why
do you think I'm paying you?

905
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,196
I never would have
recognized you, professor.

906
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,959
Yes, sir?

907
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,460
What'd you find out, Bassick?

908
00:54:58,586 --> 00:54:59,795
Just like you said.

909
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,463
They're taking the goods
off the boat tonight.

910
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:02,715
The men is waiting.

911
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,842
Excellent.
Now let's hurry.

912
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,301
Yes, sir.

913
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:12,850
??

914
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,894
Excuse me.

915
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,021
Hello, darling.

916
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,689
Are you feeling
all right, my child.

917
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,190
Yes, I think so.

918
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,109
And has that young son of mine
been behaving himself?

919
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,652
He's been awfully kind.

920
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,529
I'm afraid I'm very tiresome
this evening.

921
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,573
Nonsense.

922
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,577
No man on the bright side of
senility could possibly call
you tiresome.

923
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:35,122
Ann, you're glad you came,
aren't you?

924
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,583
- Very glad.
- Good.

925
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,209
You see, I was right.

926
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,254
It was quite the best thing for
you to do to come down here.

927
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,299
You shouldn't have thought
of staying alone in that house,

928
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,384
so soon after.

929
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,011
Perhaps you're right.

930
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,680
You're going to stay on here
over the weekend.

931
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,015
If you want me.

932
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:56,143
- As long as you like, my dear.
- Thank you.

933
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,229
Has anyone
asked for me tonight?

934
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,857
Why no?
Are you expecting someone?

935
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,026
I'm not sure.

936
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,153
Well, it doesn't matter.

937
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,614
Oh, mother. May I take Ann
away? I want her to see some
of this entertainment.

938
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,867
Of course, dear.
I hope it will be good.

939
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,035
Sit here, Ann.

940
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,787
I want you to see
this musical chap.

941
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,705
He may be amusing.

942
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:20,542
??

943
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:24,254
(Singing)
Everyone delights to spend
their summer holidays

944
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:28,008
Down beside the side
of the silvery sea

945
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:31,804
I'm no exception to the rule
in fact if I had my way

946
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,557
I'd be down beside the side
of the silvery sea

947
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:39,520
But when your just a commoner
a Smith or Jones or Brown

948
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:43,232
A business up in town
You've got to settle down

949
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,194
You save up all the money you
can till summer comes around

950
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:52,658
Then away you go
to a spot you know

951
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:58,914
Where the cockle shells
are found Oh I.....

952
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,709
Do like to be
beside the sea side

953
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:06,463
I do like to be
besides the sea

954
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,967
I do like to stroll
along the drom, drom, drom

955
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,887
Where the drum and bass,
tickely um, bum, bum

956
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:18,058
So just let me be
beside the sea side

957
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,645
I'll be beside myself with glee

958
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:25,190
for there are lots of
girls beside I should like
to be besides

959
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,109
Beside the sea side

960
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,778
Besides the sea

961
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,706
Funny fellow, isn't he?

962
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,666
Yes.

963
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,252
Ann, I wish there was something
I could do.

964
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,461
Could I get you an ice?

965
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,797
You're very kind, Tony.
I'd like that.

966
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,591
All right.
You stay here.

967
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,843
- I'll see what I can pillage,
be straight back.
- Thank you.

968
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:05,189
Good evening, Miss Brandon.
Everything all right?

969
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,192
What do you want?

970
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,235
We did have an appointment,
you know.

971
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,952
- Mr. Holmes, I--
- Shh, shh--

972
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,000
We mustn't be seen together.

973
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:27,169
Has anything happened?
Have you seen anything unusual?

974
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,962
No nothing yet.

975
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,465
Mr. Holmes, do you think I could
possibly be in danger here?

976
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,092
There's no doubt of it but
don't worry. I'll be watching.

977
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,011
- I'll be glad when it's over.
- Yes, I know.

978
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,764
Don't take any unnecessary risks.
Don't talk to strange people

979
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,600
and above all don't wander far
from the lights and the crowd.

980
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,769
You must go back.
Good luck.

981
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:58,200
??

982
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,042
Here we are, Ann.

983
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,669
Thank you.

984
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,922
Tony, that's a South American
gaucho orchestra, isn't it?

985
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,882
Yes.
Rather good aren't they?

986
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,842
Yes.

987
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,303
Shall we go in.
It's rather chilly out here.

988
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,097
Just as you like, Ann.

989
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,566
You're being too hard
on Holmes, Sir Ronald.

990
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,610
He gave me his word
he'd be here, sir.

991
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,237
He sent me in his place.

992
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,780
You?

993
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,283
Well, sir, I've been with
Holmes on a good many cases

994
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,994
and I can assure you, you might
have done considerably worse.

995
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,870
I dare say you might help.

996
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,164
Where at least are
the policemen he promised
to send me?

997
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,499
They'll be here directly.

998
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:50,043
A sergeant and two policemen,
picked men, sir.

999
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,463
What is it, sergeant?

1000
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:55,173
Police officers
to see Dr. Watson, sir.

1001
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,050
Bring 'em in.

1002
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,719
It's about time.

1003
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:04,141
- Is Dr. Watson here?
- Yes, I am Dr. Watson.

1004
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,976
Sergeant Bullfinch
at your service, sir.

1005
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,103
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- My I see your
identification, sir?

1006
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:09,980
I told you I am Dr. Watson.

1007
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,065
I don't doubt that, sir,
but the inspector said

1008
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,027
I was to be particular
about identification, sir.

1009
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,574
Well, you seem to be
a law-abiding citizen.

1010
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,493
- I suppose you'll be
wanting to see mine?
- Yes, please.

1011
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,919
Everything seems in order,
Sir Ronald.

1012
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:42,637
Prepare to halt.

1013
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,681
Company halt.

1014
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:50,020
Captain Mannery, Royal Navy,
with escort reporting to
Sir Ronald Ramsey.

1015
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,688
Just a moment, sir.

1016
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,399
- Is that you, Sir Ronald?
- Yes.

1017
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:55,442
Captain Mannery?

1018
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,568
Yes, sir.

1019
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,362
Raise the port trellis.

1020
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,452
Well, here it is, Sir Ronald.

1021
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:08,413
Ah.
The Star of Deli.

1022
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,085
This has been a great anxiety
to me, Captain Mannery.

1023
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,961
I can't tell you how relieved
I shall be

1024
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,923
when I have this jewel
safely locked up in the tower.

1025
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,257
Would you like us
to go with you, sir?

1026
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,426
No, there's no occasion.
I have ample protection.

1027
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:22,928
Then I bid you goodbye,
Sir Ronald.

1028
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,680
Goodbye, Captain Mannery.
I am most grateful to you.

1029
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,392
- Thank you, sir.
- Gentlemen.

1030
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,434
All right, Gentlemen.

1031
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,186
Guard, about face.

1032
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:32,813
Forward march.

1033
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,029
Halt.

1034
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,385
Ah. It's the longest
short walk I ever had.

1035
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,554
Hold that for a moment,
will you?

1036
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,639
The Crown Jewels, gentlemen,

1037
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:11,143
the accumulated wealth of ten
centuries of English kings,

1038
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,978
a grave responsibility.

1039
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,147
It's not often
this door is unlocked

1040
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,983
and this is the key
to all this treasure.

1041
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,736
Now!

1042
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,822
(All fighting)

1043
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,085
- The emerald!
- Where is it?

1044
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,337
- Somebody snatched it.
- The policemen,
where are they?

1045
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,965
They're not policemen at all.
After them.

1046
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:45,844
Guards, the stairs.

1047
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,932
Sir Ronald, look.

1048
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:58,315
The Star of Deli.
They've dropped it.

1049
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,691
You see, Sir Ronald.

1050
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,860
Every thing's turned out
all right after all.

1051
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,945
And all thanks to your brilliant
friend, Sherlock Holmes.

1052
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,447
So my fears were ridiculous

1053
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,657
and that note was merely
the work of a crank.

1054
01:03:07,783 --> 01:03:09,784
Nobody would steal
the Star of Deli.

1055
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:13,788
- No one there, Sir Ronald.
- Never mind, Sergeant.
I have the jewel.

1056
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,169
I have a good mind to give
this story to the press.

1057
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,795
It will put Holmes
in his place.

1058
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,797
Oh, I wouldn't do that,
Sir Ronald.

1059
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,258
- You have got the jewel back.
- I have indeed,

1060
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,636
as safe as the
Crown Jewels of England,

1061
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,346
but no thanks to Holmes.

1062
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,348
Well, he did send me
in his place.

1063
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,433
Yes, and it's a capital thing
he did.

1064
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,976
You're a splendid fellow,
Watson.

1065
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,811
You've done me a
great service tonight.

1066
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,314
I shall see to it
that your courage is reported

1067
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,817
- in due course
to the proper authorities.
- Thank you.

1068
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:43,944
Come along, Sergeant.

1069
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,695
- Turn out the lights.
- Yes, sir.

1070
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:47,781
They got away, sir,
in the direction of Tower Hill.

1071
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,491
But they left
what they came for.

1072
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:52,410
- The emerald is safe.
- Oh good, sir.

1073
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:53,995
All right, Sergeant.

1074
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,255
Goodbye, my dear. I'll drive
over and see you tomorrow.

1075
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,218
- You're terribly tired,
my child, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

1076
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,178
You better go to bed.

1077
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,806
I'm going to look in on you
later and if you're not asleep,

1078
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,183
- I shall be very severe.
- Uh-uh.

1079
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:02,188
Whatever is the matter
with you, my dear?

1080
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,149
I just noticed the time.

1081
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,276
That clock on the landing.

1082
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,612
It's seven minutes to twelve.

1083
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,573
In another eight minutes it
won't be May the 13th anymore.

1084
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,617
You must go to bed at once,
You really must.

1085
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,119
- I'll go with you.
- I'd like you to.

1086
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,204
Only I shouldn't take you away.

1087
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,998
Nonsense.
They've all gone.

1088
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:22,917
Besides no one misses
a middle-aged hostess.

1089
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,550
Have a good rest, my dear,
and be sure to sleep late.

1090
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:33,053
It's an invariable custom
of the house.

1091
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,721
I'll try.

1092
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,140
- Good night.
- Good night, my dear.

1093
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:15,762
??

1094
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,296
I was just coming to find you,
Miss Brandon.

1095
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,090
There's a gentleman on the
terrace asking to see you

1096
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:53,883
and he says it's
most important.

1097
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:56,094
Mr. Holmes, thank you.

1098
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:10,483
Ann, my dear.

1099
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:12,068
What are you doing here?

1100
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,486
Am I so unwelcome then?

1101
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,946
Why did you come?

1102
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:17,031
I've been terribly worried
about you, darling.

1103
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,742
I wanted to be sure
you were safe.

1104
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,286
Why did you think
I might not be safe?

1105
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,622
Ann, whatever has
come over you?

1106
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,584
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

1107
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,379
Surely you're not afraid of me?

1108
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:33,047
You are afraid.

1109
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,758
That's how much
all the years have counted.

1110
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,970
You think I want to hurt you.

1111
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,680
I don't know why I don't.

1112
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,730
Ann! Wait!

1113
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,648
Come here, Ann!

1114
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:16,549
??

1115
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,507
Come along this way. Quick.

1116
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,592
Ahh!

1117
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,665
- Holmes, you all right?
- Never better, Watson.

1118
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,167
And Miss Brandon?

1119
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,002
She'll be all right,
the poor child she's fainted.

1120
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:16,836
Look after her will you,
Andrews, and take her back
to the house.

1121
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:17,879
Very good, Mr. Holmes?

1122
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,464
What on earth is this, Holmes?

1123
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,382
This, Watson,
is a South American bolas,

1124
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,593
- the instrument that killed
Lloyd Brandon.
- What?

1125
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,762
Yes. Come and take a look
at his murderer.

1126
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,190
He's badly hurt.

1127
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,733
Can he be moved, doctor?

1128
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:41,694
- Yes.
- Then I'll take him
to The Yard.

1129
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:48,451
Yes, it's just as I suspected.

1130
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,411
This club footed shoe
was a very clever device

1131
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:52,789
but not quite clever enough,
my friend.

1132
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,416
I'll wager you didn't think
of it yourself. Who put you
up to it?

1133
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:58,878
The professor. He's said he'd
fix it so I don't get caught.

1134
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:00,213
Professor Moriarty.

1135
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,298
Si, Moriarty.

1136
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:03,716
I'll kill him.

1137
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,010
I scarcely think
you'll have the chance now.

1138
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:08,805
So that clears up our case.

1139
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,265
Clears it up?
We've only just begun.
Come along, Watson. Quick!

1140
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:45,008
Shh. Don't move.

1141
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:47,218
Stay where you are
and keep your eyes open.

1142
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,086
All right, come on, Watson.
There's nobody here.

1143
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:23,963
Well, why didn't you
say so before?

1144
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,262
Oh, lilly pond.

1145
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:41,105
- Damp.
- Damp, I'm wet through.

1146
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:43,191
He's been shaving.

1147
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:45,651
Moriarty's worn that beard
for years. Why would he shave
it off?

1148
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,570
- To disguise himself,
of course.
- Obviously, Watson.

1149
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,947
But why tonight especially
for what purpose?

1150
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,407
Huh?

1151
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,373
A Baedeker.

1152
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,667
What would Moriarty
be doing with a guidebook?

1153
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:03,836
He knows London
like a cab driver.

1154
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,465
Look, Watson, look.

1155
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:09,550
The Tower of London.

1156
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,052
Sergeant Bullfinch.

1157
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,221
Moriarty without his beard.

1158
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:17,266
- Then he stole the emerald!
- I wonder what exactly he did
do, or rather is doing.

1159
01:13:17,392 --> 01:13:18,643
What do you mean, Holmes?

1160
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,186
Don't you see, my dear Watson.

1161
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:22,271
Moriarty concocted
that Brandon case

1162
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:24,565
with all its fantastic
convolutions expressly to
divert my attention

1163
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:26,651
till the time the Star of Deli
was delivered.

1164
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:29,070
So that he could steal the
emerald but he didn't get it.
We fooled him.

1165
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:32,448
That's exactly the point,
Watson. He didn't want the
Star of Deli.

1166
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:33,991
- What?
- No.

1167
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,661
The real crime
has not yet come to light.

1168
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,080
He caused a man to be murdered
solely in order to distract me.

1169
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:41,207
He staged that fiasco
at the Tower of London.

1170
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:44,460
Why I don't know
but one thing I'm certain.
It was all done with a purpose.

1171
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,672
Somewhere in London
at this very moment something
tremendous is happening.

1172
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:50,091
He said he was going to do it
and he's doing it now,

1173
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:52,844
the most stupendous,
the most incredible crime
of the century,

1174
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:56,055
the crowning act
of his career...

1175
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:58,808
The crowning act.

1176
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:01,060
Crowning?

1177
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:03,312
"St. Edward's crown.

1178
01:14:03,438 --> 01:14:07,483
This was the crown stolen from
the Tower of London in 1671

1179
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,652
by Colonel Blood
and his accomplices,

1180
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:13,739
the total value of the
regalia is estimated at three
million pounds."

1181
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,159
Watson, the Crown Jewels!
We're wasting time.

1182
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:26,627
Ay, cabby.

1183
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:28,504
Never mind, get in, Watson.

1184
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,496
I say, steady. Drive a little
careful, old boy.

1185
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,142
Serg, Sergeant!

1186
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:30,399
- What is it, McKenzie?
- An accident, Sergeant.

1187
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,114
Give me your hand.
Get this man out of here.

1188
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,456
Well, what were
you trying to do,

1189
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:46,749
batter your way
right into the Tower of London?

1190
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,292
Of course not, course not,
preposterous.

1191
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:49,502
Well, what were you doing?

1192
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,003
- Well I--
- Where is your cabby?

1193
01:15:51,129 --> 01:15:53,256
Cabby?
Oh, yes, yes, cabby.

1194
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,548
Well, where is he?

1195
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,092
I don't know,
I haven' the faintest idea.

1196
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,135
- Bring him along
to the posting room.
- Where?

1197
01:18:46,721 --> 01:18:47,930
Did you hear a shot?

1198
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,056
I did, sir, I thought it came
from the tower.

1199
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:50,433
Follow me on the double.

1200
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,608
Well, "Ann Brandon 21,
and Jerrold Hunter 29,

1201
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:25,611
were married this morning
at the Castone Hall
Register Office."

1202
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:27,655
Well, that takes care of that

1203
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:31,242
but I still don't understand
how young Hunter became
involved in the mystery.

1204
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,701
Alfred?

1205
01:20:32,827 --> 01:20:34,578
- May I borrow your violin?
- Certainly, governor.

1206
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:40,292
I said, I still don't
understand how young Hunter
became involved.

1207
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:44,421
Perfectly simple. Whatever
Gerald Hunter did was done to
protect Miss Brandon.

1208
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:46,840
But I saw it myself
posited with Moriarty.

1209
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,552
My dear Watson, I expected even
you to see through that trick.

1210
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:53,764
Moriarty went to him with a
trumped up lawsuit to put us
off the track.

1211
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,808
Those flies again.

1212
01:20:59,854 --> 01:21:01,397
Very effective,
my dear Watson.

1213
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:07,778
Elementary, my dear Holmes,
elementary.

2
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,300
Look out the window.

3
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,654
And doesn't this remind you
of when you were in the boat?

4
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:28,312
And then later that night,

5
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:32,440
you were lying, looking
up at the ceiling,

6
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:35,273
and the water
in your head...

7
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:38,209
was not dissimilar
from the landscape,

8
00:05:38,523 --> 00:05:42,118
and you think to yourself,
"Why is it that the landscape...

9
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:44,227
is moving,

10
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:48,332
but... the boat
is still?"

11
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:54,440
And also...
Where is it that you're from?

12
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:59,242
- Cleveland.
- Cleveland.

13
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:05,674
- Lake Erie.
- Erie.

14
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:09,653
Do you have any parents
back in, uh, Erie?

15
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:13,588
They passed on recently.

16
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:19,364
And, uh,

17
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,169
do you have a wife...

18
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,739
in Erie?

19
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:28,141
No.

20
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:33,378
- A fiancee?
- Well, I...

21
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,710
I had one of those,
but, um,

22
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:39,819
she changed her mind.

23
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:46,014
- She found herself somebody else.
- No.

24
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:49,795
Yes, she did.

25
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,559
Well, that doesn't explain...

26
00:06:56,671 --> 00:06:59,299
why you've come
all the way out here,

27
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:01,398
all the way out here to hell.

28
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:05,245
I, uh,

29
00:07:06,114 --> 00:07:10,574
have a job
out in the town of Machine.

30
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:13,347
Machine? That's
the end of the line.

31
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:16,356
- Is it?
- Yes.

32
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Well, I...

33
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:24,230
received a letter...

34
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,663
from the people at Dickinson's
Metal Works...

35
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:29,771
Oh.

36
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:32,934
assuring me
of a job there.

37
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,135
Is that so?

38
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:38,042
Yes. I'm an accountant.

39
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:43,278
I wouldn't know,
because, uh, I don't read,

40
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:47,880
but, uh, I'll tell you
one thing for sure:

41
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,426
I wouldn't trust no words
written down on no piece of paper,

42
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:56,430
especially from no "Dickinson"
out in the town of Machine.

43
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:59,729
- You're just as likely
to find your own grave.

44
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:05,300
Look. They're
shooting buffalo.

45
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:12,782
Government says...

46
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:16,649
killed a million of 'em
last year alone.

47
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:58,175
Pardon me, sir. Could you please
direct me towards the office?

48
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,915
Thank you.

49
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,911
Excuse me.

50
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,105
Excuse me.
How do you do, sir?

51
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,651
I'm Bill Blake,
your new accountant from Cleveland.

52
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,215
What the heck
are you doin' here?

53
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:49,187
Well, uh, I have here
this letter...

54
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,388
which confirms
my position here.

55
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,595
Well, this letter
is postmarked two months ago.

56
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,832
Makes you about
a month late.

57
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,502
This here is Mr. Olafsen.
He's our new accountant.

58
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:14,310
I'm sorry. I think
there's been some mistake.

59
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,481
- Look, Mr. Black,
- Blake.

60
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:22,551
I'm a very busy man, and Mr. Dickinson
does not pay me for idle conversation.

61
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:27,566
Well, I'm sure he doesn't, but
this letter confirms my position here.

62
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:31,604
Now, I've spent everything I had left after
my parent's funeral just to get here.

63
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,733
Listen, Mr. Black,
I've got a lot of work to do here,

64
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:38,870
and this ain't
my business.

65
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,608
I'd like to speak
to Mr. Dickinson.

66
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,428
No, I-I don't think
you want to do that.

67
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:57,191
I insist on speaking
to Mr. Dickinson, sir.

68
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:59,460
You insist?

69
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:02,503
- I insist.
- You insist?

70
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:06,206
Yes, I do.

71
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:12,914
Well, go on then, lad.
There's the door.

72
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,586
All right then.

73
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:20,588
Go on then!

74
00:15:21,624 --> 00:15:23,524
Well, I will.

75
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:39,707
Hello?

76
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:43,145
Mr. Dickinson?

77
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:15,378
Who the hell are you?

78
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,814
And where did you get
that goddamn clown suit? Cleveland?

79
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:23,081
Well, actually, yes, sir.

80
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:25,621
I did, uh, get it
in Cleveland.

81
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:29,459
What the hell are you
doin' in my office?

82
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,290
Well, I-I-I came
to talk about my job.

83
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:37,027
The only job you're gonna get in here
is pushin' up daisies from a pine box.

84
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:39,194
Now get out.

85
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:44,207
Thank you
very much, sir.

86
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:06,293
Back to work,
Mr. Olafsen.

87
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,855
Excuse me.

88
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:53,006
Excuse me.

89
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:54,308
Sorry.

90
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:58,612
Pardon me, sir.

91
00:19:01,551 --> 00:19:03,451
Could I get
a bottle, please?

92
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,025
We liked you better
when you was a whore.

93
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:20,897
Jackass.

94
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,935
Shit!

95
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:37,972
Why don't you just
paint my portrait?

96
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:45,891
I'm sorry.

97
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:48,983
- Let me help here. One.
- This one's no good. No, it's ruined.

98
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:51,062
- Two.
- It's no good.

99
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,368
Oh, here. Oh!

100
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:00,737
Watch yourself.

101
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:03,364
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

102
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,875
Here. Have a drink.
Would you like a drink?

103
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:08,546
Thanks.

104
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:22,694
I'm sorry.

105
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:27,398
Would you mind walking me
away from here?

106
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:32,064
- S-Sure. Sure.
- Yeah?

107
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:35,673
I'll just get
my suitcase.

108
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:45,784
- It's that way.
- All right.

109
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:50,122
Oh, shit.

110
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:56,228
I have a sneaking suspicion that that
large man back there was inebriated.

111
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,176
- I was gonna say something, but
I don't wanna cause any trouble.

112
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,323
No, I think it's best.

113
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:09,708
That's my room.

114
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,717
Wasn't... expecting
any visitor.

115
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,732
- Like it?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

116
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,202
These flowers. Gosh.

117
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:43,143
They really
are something.

118
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:46,678
Yeah. Thank you.

119
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,683
You're welcome.

120
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:56,213
I made them
from paper.

121
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,400
If I ever get the money,

122
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:09,130
I'd like to make them
out of cloth.

123
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,540
Silk.

124
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,477
And I'd put
a drop of perfume...

125
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,981
French perfume...

126
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:23,485
in each one.

127
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,463
What does it
smell like?

128
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:38,258
- Paper.
- Well, it is paper.

129
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:55,081
Hey, Bill.
You got any tobacco anywhere?

130
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:57,848
- No, I don't smoke.
- Damn.

131
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:01,358
Ow!

132
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,130
Oh, watch it.
It's loaded.

133
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:12,059
Why do you
have this?

134
00:24:13,204 --> 00:24:15,195
'Cause this is America.

135
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:28,452
Charlie.

136
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:42,099
You know, Thel,

137
00:24:43,469 --> 00:24:45,903
I never wanted
to go away.

138
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,065
I know we said
it was, uh,

139
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,201
it was all over
and everything, but...

140
00:24:56,749 --> 00:24:59,047
you were always
in my heart, Thel.

141
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:02,321
Always.

142
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:06,558
I, uh...

143
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,285
I brought you, uh...

144
00:25:09,396 --> 00:25:13,526
Well, it's a present.

145
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:22,273
A present?

146
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:24,442
Well, I, uh...

147
00:25:26,346 --> 00:25:28,246
I'm... I'm goin'.

148
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,450
And, uh,

149
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:36,680
I'm... I'm sorry, Thel,

150
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:39,859
for, uh,

151
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:43,596
for intrudin'.

152
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,693
Well, I never really
loved you anyway.

153
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:56,142
No, Charlie.

154
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:00,670
- I never stopped lovingly, Thel.
- Don't!

155
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,390
Thel.

156
00:28:23,362 --> 00:28:26,058
Here's white man's metal
next to your heart.

157
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:29,259
I tried to cut it out,
but it's too deep inside.

158
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,764
A knife would cut
your heart instead...

159
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:37,138
and release the spirit
from within.

160
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:41,476
Stupid fucking white man.

161
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:01,598
Do you have any tobacco?

162
00:29:03,203 --> 00:29:05,228
I don't smoke.

163
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,605
Hey, Wilson,
got any extra tobacco?

164
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,976
Well, of course you wouldn't have
any extra tobacco. How 'bout you?

165
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:52,782
Shit. You ain't even
old enough to smoke.

166
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:18,406
Mr. John Dickinson.

167
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:31,091
Last night,
my youngest son, Charlie...

168
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:33,128
God bless his soul...

169
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:37,859
was gunned down in cold blood
right here in our own hotel.

170
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:43,337
The gutless murderer, one Mr. Bill Blake,
also shot to death Miss Thel Russel,

171
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:46,408
the fiancée
of my beloved son.

172
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:51,446
Not only that, but he stole
a very spirited and valuable horse,

173
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:56,884
a beautiful young pinto that belonged
to my personal family stable.

174
00:30:56,986 --> 00:31:01,788
Hell, only, a pinto ain't rightly a horse to
fret much about, if the truth be told.

175
00:31:01,892 --> 00:31:03,492
Shut up!

176
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,201
You three are supposed to be
the finest killers of men and Indians...

177
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,905
in this here
half of the world.

178
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:27,643
Cole Wilson,
your reputation is already a legend.

179
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:30,481
You I know I can trust.

180
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:34,491
Conway Twill, you're
a real good killer,

181
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:38,586
but be sure you keep
that goddamn trap shut.

182
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,927
And Johnny
"The Kid"Pickett.

183
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,933
I heard tell
you killed 14 men.

184
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,128
I doubt you've seen
that many years,

185
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:50,231
and I ain't even gonna tell you
what I really think of you.

186
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,641
- I always work alone.
- Uh, excuse me there, Mr. Dickinson,

187
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,943
but, uh, rightly I, I never
have worked with anyone else either.

188
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,143
- I never have.
- Uh, yeah, m-me neither.

189
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,853
Shut up!

190
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,620
My boy Charlie is dead!

191
00:32:09,729 --> 00:32:14,063
Oh, I ain't askin' this time.
I'm tellin',

192
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:19,502
and if somebody don't like it,
I'm prepared to do a little killin' of my own.

193
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:23,541
Now, that bastard
couldn't have got too far yet.

194
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:26,476
Well, why don't we just
say there, Mr. Dickinson, sir,

195
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:29,377
I think we oughta start
uh, fresh in the mornin'.

196
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:31,916
I mean, it's
well after noon now,

197
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:34,885
and time we get finished,
all packed up and...

198
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,866
I want him brought here to me...
alive or dead don't matter,

199
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:49,959
though I reckon dead
would be easier.

200
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,005
I'm a-hiring boys
on an exclusive basis,

201
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:57,406
and I'm willing pay more money
than you've ever seen before.

202
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:00,546
Boys,

203
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:08,253
the hunt is on.

204
00:33:43,157 --> 00:33:45,182
Stupid fucking
white man.

205
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:25,094
I want this out
over the wires.

206
00:34:25,201 --> 00:34:29,035
Post a $500 reward
from here to hell and back.

207
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:34,702
Notify every marshal, deputy and
possum-skinnin' lowlife in the goddamn territory.

208
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:37,837
Bring everybody in.
I want that bastard's head.

209
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:42,316
And make sure you include a full description
of my pinto. I want that horse back.

210
00:34:43,887 --> 00:34:46,754
Goddamn pinto is a stupid damn animal.

211
00:34:46,856 --> 00:34:49,256
Stupid as the day
is long.

212
00:34:51,796 --> 00:34:55,027
Got his heart so set on one.
Buy yourself a sorrel horse...

213
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:57,896
and paint some white spots on him
as far as I'm concerned.

214
00:34:58,002 --> 00:34:59,902
Jesus Christ.

215
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:03,804
Course, ya can't put much stock in a man
who spends the most part of a conversation...

216
00:35:03,908 --> 00:35:05,808
talkin' to a bear.

217
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:09,345
Talkin'
to a goddamn bear.

218
00:35:32,204 --> 00:35:34,832
The round stones
beneath the earth...

219
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,840
have spoken
through the fire.

220
00:35:41,813 --> 00:35:42,813
What?

221
00:35:43,815 --> 00:35:48,309
Things which are alike,
in nature, grow to look alike,

222
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:53,990
and the speaking stones have lain
a long time lookin' at the sun.

223
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:04,169
The speaking stones?

224
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,363
Some believe
they descend with the lightning,

225
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:11,569
but I believe they are on the ground
and are projected downward by the bolt.

226
00:36:15,982 --> 00:36:18,382
Did you kill the white man
who killed you?

227
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,191
I'm not dead.

228
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:34,300
What name were you given
at birth, stupid white man?

229
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:41,006
Blake.

230
00:36:42,342 --> 00:36:45,072
William Blake.

231
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:48,307
Is this a lie?
Or a white man's trick?

232
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,714
No, I'm William Blake.

233
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:56,652
Then you are a dead man.

234
00:36:58,392 --> 00:37:00,292
I'm sorry. I d...
I don't understand.

235
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:04,662
Is your name really
William Blake?

236
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Yes.

237
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,911
Every night...

238
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:21,914
and every morn',

239
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:25,618
some to misery
are born.

240
00:37:29,724 --> 00:37:32,887
Every morn'
and every night,

241
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:37,091
some are born
to sweet delight.

242
00:37:38,968 --> 00:37:40,902
Some are born
to sweet delight.

243
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:45,504
Some are born
to endless night.

244
00:37:50,946 --> 00:37:54,279
I really
don't understand.

245
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,519
But I understand,
William Blake.

246
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:01,613
You were a poet
and a painter.

247
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:06,186
And now, you are
a killer of white men.

248
00:38:13,436 --> 00:38:15,631
You must rest now,
William Blake.

249
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,019
Some are born
to sweet delight.

250
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:45,164
Some are born
to endless night.

251
00:38:50,841 --> 00:38:52,866
Makin' biscuits, Mommy.

252
00:39:02,286 --> 00:39:04,186
Sweetheart.

253
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:14,794
You didn't touch it,
did you?

254
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:17,667
- Huh?
- No.

255
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:19,794
- You swear to me.
- I swear.

256
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:24,307
Swear to me you're
tellin' the truth.

257
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:26,309
Yes, I swear I'm
tellin' the truth.

258
00:39:35,954 --> 00:39:39,048
Not a goddamn word
to no one, ever.

259
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:41,057
You understand?

260
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:44,659
Don't ever ask me
no questions.

261
00:42:17,854 --> 00:42:19,754
Where are we?

262
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:23,391
You are being followed,
William Blake.

263
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:28,361
Are you sure?
I mean, how do you know?

264
00:42:33,437 --> 00:42:37,430
Often the evil stench
of white man precedes him.

265
00:42:41,846 --> 00:42:43,746
Why don't we, uh...

266
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,118
Maybe we should, uh...

267
00:42:52,256 --> 00:42:55,157
What should we do?

268
00:42:55,259 --> 00:42:59,491
The eagle never lost so much time as
when he submitted to learn from the crow.

269
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,720
Ever wish you were the moon?

270
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,815
Geez, my Henry's cold.

271
00:43:27,926 --> 00:43:29,826
Aw, come on!

272
00:43:31,997 --> 00:43:34,397
My britches been open
like that how long?

273
00:43:34,499 --> 00:43:36,524
Only been ridin' a couple
of days together, but Jesus,

274
00:43:36,635 --> 00:43:38,763
one of you fellas could've
mentioned the fact that...

275
00:43:38,871 --> 00:43:41,305
Unsaddle
your goddamn horses.

276
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:45,742
Unsaddle
your goddamn horse.

277
00:43:48,748 --> 00:43:49,948
Go on.

278
00:43:53,586 --> 00:43:57,420
- Geez.
- An Injun dug this fire pit.

279
00:43:57,523 --> 00:43:58,523
Oh.

280
00:44:01,094 --> 00:44:02,925
Oh, an Indian.

281
00:44:03,029 --> 00:44:05,623
We ain't trackin' no goddamn
Injuns, Cole. I mean, uh,

282
00:44:05,732 --> 00:44:09,065
hell, Dickinson didn't say nothin'
about trackin' no goddamn Injuns.

283
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:11,103
I mean, the boy's name
is William Blake.

284
00:44:11,205 --> 00:44:14,868
You know a lotta Indians, do ya, named
William Blake? I mean, "Howdy, Chief Billy..."

285
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,909
D'you hear somethin'?

286
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:18,011
Huh?

287
00:44:20,681 --> 00:44:22,649
- Did ya?
- No. No.

288
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:25,984
I guess it was nothin'.

289
00:44:48,943 --> 00:44:51,673
You know about Wilson?

290
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,614
- What?
- Do you know about Cole Wilson?

291
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:00,279
What kinda question is that?
'Course I know about Cole Wilson.

292
00:45:00,388 --> 00:45:02,754
Everybody knows about him.
He's a livin' legend.

293
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:04,757
Fucked his parents.

294
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:11,956
- He what?
- He fucked his parents.

295
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,871
- Both of 'em?
- Yeah.

296
00:45:19,642 --> 00:45:23,100
Mother. Father. Parents.
Both of 'em. Fucked 'em.

297
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,349
Oh.

298
00:45:31,053 --> 00:45:32,953
And you know
what I heard?

299
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:38,425
After he killed 'em,
he cooked 'em up and ate 'em.

300
00:45:45,968 --> 00:45:48,562
Are you telling me
he killed both his pa...

301
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:52,733
I'm tellin' you he killed 'em. He fucked 'em.
He cooked 'em up. He ate 'em.

302
00:45:55,479 --> 00:45:58,778
He ain't got a goddamn conscience.
You understand what I'm sayin'?

303
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:03,216
He'd just as soon slit our goddamn throats
in the middle of the night as walk.

304
00:46:06,456 --> 00:46:09,425
Course, someone
your age, Jesus,

305
00:46:11,194 --> 00:46:13,094
if you was
to put one in him...

306
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:19,332
"Johnny 'The Kid' Pickett
Slays Cole Wilson."

307
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:51,464
William Blake,

308
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:53,867
do you know how
to use this weapon?

309
00:47:01,146 --> 00:47:04,479
- Not really.
- That weapon will replace your tongue.

310
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:09,754
You will learn
to speak through it,

311
00:47:09,855 --> 00:47:13,416
and your poetry
will now be written with blood.

312
00:47:25,871 --> 00:47:27,805
What is your name?

313
00:47:37,317 --> 00:47:39,251
My name is Nobody.

314
00:47:41,821 --> 00:47:45,484
- Excuse me?
- My name is Exaybachay:

315
00:47:45,592 --> 00:47:48,561
He Who Talks Loud,
Saying Nothing.

316
00:47:52,065 --> 00:47:54,397
He Who Talks...

317
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,298
I thought you said
your name was Nobody.

318
00:47:59,005 --> 00:48:01,065
I prefer
to be called Nobody.

319
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:12,385
Nobody?

320
00:48:12,987 --> 00:48:16,821
Um, shouldn't you be
with your own tribe or somethin'?

321
00:48:21,195 --> 00:48:23,720
My blood is mixed.

322
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:27,028
My mother was
Ohm gahpi phi gun ni.

323
00:48:28,402 --> 00:48:30,461
My father is
Abso luka.

324
00:48:33,207 --> 00:48:35,733
This mixture
was not respected.

325
00:48:35,844 --> 00:48:38,142
As a small boy,

326
00:48:38,246 --> 00:48:40,476
I was often left
to myself.

327
00:48:40,582 --> 00:48:43,779
So I spent many months
stalking the elk people...

328
00:48:43,885 --> 00:48:47,377
to prove I would soon
become a good hunter.

329
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:51,357
One day, finally,
my elk relatives took pity on me,

330
00:48:51,459 --> 00:48:53,893
and a young elk
gave his life to me.

331
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,361
With only my knife,
I took his life.

332
00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:03,529
As I was preparing to cut the meat,
white men came upon me.

333
00:49:03,638 --> 00:49:05,629
They were English soldiers.

334
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,905
I cut one with my knife, but they
hit me on the head with a rifle.

335
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,546
All went black.

336
00:49:13,649 --> 00:49:15,549
My spirit seemed
to leave me.

337
00:49:17,887 --> 00:49:20,651
I was then taken east...

338
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:22,756
in a cage.

339
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:27,159
I was taken to Toronto,
then Philadelphia...

340
00:49:28,664 --> 00:49:30,655
and then to New York.

341
00:49:30,766 --> 00:49:34,497
And each time I arrived
in another city,

342
00:49:34,603 --> 00:49:36,571
somehow the white men
had moved...

343
00:49:36,672 --> 00:49:38,606
all their people there
ahead of me.

344
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:45,146
Each new city contained
the same white people as the last,

345
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:48,274
and I could not understand
how a whole city of people...

346
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,285
could be moved
so quickly.

347
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:56,424
Eventually, I was
taken on a ship...

348
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,824
across the great sea...

349
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,988
over to England,

350
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,430
and I was paraded
before them...

351
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,660
like a captured animal,

352
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,669
an exhibit.

353
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:12,808
And so I mimicked them,
imitating their ways,

354
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,176
hoping that they might lose interest
in this young savage,

355
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:19,647
but their interest
only grew.

356
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:21,946
So they placed me into
the white man's schools.

357
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:26,217
It was there
that I discovered...

358
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,588
in a book...

359
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:31,685
the words that you,
William Blake, had written.

360
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:37,632
They were powerful words,
and they spoke to me.

361
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:44,541
But I made careful plans,
and I eventually escaped.

362
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:50,238
Once again, I crossed
the great ocean.

363
00:50:51,917 --> 00:50:53,908
I saw many sad things...

364
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:57,648
as I made my way back
to the lands of my people.

365
00:50:57,756 --> 00:51:00,691
Once they realized
who I was,

366
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:02,954
the stories of my adventures
angered them.

367
00:51:04,696 --> 00:51:06,596
They called me a liar.

368
00:51:06,698 --> 00:51:11,067
"Exaybachay."
He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing.

369
00:51:12,638 --> 00:51:15,163
They ridiculed me.
My own people.

370
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:19,541
And I was left to wander
the earth alone.

371
00:51:22,715 --> 00:51:24,615
I am Nobody.

372
00:51:31,057 --> 00:51:34,515
Ain't ya glad the sun
kind of sets? Prepares you like?

373
00:51:34,627 --> 00:51:38,757
I mean, what if it, like, went out sudden,
like, say, blowin' out a candle or somethin'?

374
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:41,766
I mean... You know, one minute we're ridin' along,
we can see everything and each other...

375
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:45,429
and, boom, the next minute is just...
you're in total darkness.

376
00:51:45,538 --> 00:51:47,733
That'd scare
the bejesus outta me.

377
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:56,806
Once upon a time,
there were three bears in the forest.

378
00:51:56,917 --> 00:52:00,182
A big bear,
a medium mommy bear...

379
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,812
and a tiny
little baby bear.

380
00:52:02,923 --> 00:52:07,189
One mornin', they were gonna eat
their breakfast porridge.

381
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:11,253
They had a big bowl,
a medium bowl and a tiny little bowl.

382
00:52:11,365 --> 00:52:13,492
That porridge was too hot.

383
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:15,831
Stupid white man.

384
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:21,339
- So they went to take a walk.
- William Blake, you go to them.

385
00:52:21,442 --> 00:52:24,901
- Along came this girl. She was...
- What?

386
00:52:26,948 --> 00:52:29,644
Alone? Why don't we
just go around them?

387
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:30,751
No!

388
00:52:32,154 --> 00:52:33,554
You go.

389
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:36,189
It's a test.

390
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:41,690
I don't know those people,
and they don't look very friendly.

391
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:45,095
- What if they kill me?
- Nobody will observe.

392
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,033
She got sleepy, and she
went into their bedroom.

393
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:51,333
- There was a big bed, a medium bed
and a tiny little bed. - All right.

394
00:52:51,439 --> 00:52:53,566
- I'll go.
- ...their tiny bed.

395
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:56,235
I'd rather not,
but I'll go.

396
00:52:56,344 --> 00:52:59,508
The bears got home.
Papa said,

397
00:52:59,615 --> 00:53:02,345
"Somebody here ate
all our porridge."

398
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:07,380
- What's the best way to get down there?
- Be quiet and go.

399
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,390
- And he scalped her,
- All right.

400
00:53:09,492 --> 00:53:12,552
and he tore her head
off her body.

401
00:53:12,662 --> 00:53:17,122
And he took that golden hair,
and he made a sweater for baby bear.

402
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:20,031
- That's terrible.
- Tonight we're reminded...

403
00:53:20,136 --> 00:53:23,697
of the evil emperor
Nero Augustus.

404
00:53:23,806 --> 00:53:27,537
He was the scourge
of all the Christians.

405
00:53:27,643 --> 00:53:29,736
What's a scourge?

406
00:53:29,846 --> 00:53:33,213
It's... It's like when
somethin' real bad happens.

407
00:53:33,317 --> 00:53:36,844
Like when everybody gets killed
and you can't do anything about it.

408
00:53:36,954 --> 00:53:39,354
Like a swarm of locusts.

409
00:53:39,456 --> 00:53:41,947
For the entertainment
of his guests,

410
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:43,959
Nero would illuminate
his whole garden...

411
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:47,997
with bodies of live Christians
covered in burning oil...

412
00:53:48,098 --> 00:53:52,228
strung up
on flaming crosses, crucified.

413
00:53:54,605 --> 00:53:57,405
And at dinner,

414
00:53:57,674 --> 00:53:59,835
he would have the Christians
rubbed by his guards...

415
00:53:59,943 --> 00:54:03,607
with aromatic herbs
and garlic...

416
00:54:03,715 --> 00:54:06,707
and sewn up into sacks.

417
00:54:06,818 --> 00:54:10,117
And then they'd throw
these sacks to the wild dogs.

418
00:54:10,221 --> 00:54:12,246
Well, that's terrible.

419
00:54:12,357 --> 00:54:15,758
- It's horrible.
- Terrible's what it is.

420
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:20,954
You know, I just... I can't
drink whiskey like I used to could.

421
00:54:21,065 --> 00:54:23,192
My old belly
just ain't no account.

422
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,735
I get the shits every time,
don't you know?

423
00:54:25,837 --> 00:54:27,964
I'm sorry, Big George.

424
00:54:28,072 --> 00:54:32,338
I got some food here that
even Goldilocks never tasted.

425
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:34,934
I think this is gonna
fix up your old gut.

426
00:54:43,622 --> 00:54:47,080
These beans is shit.

427
00:54:47,192 --> 00:54:50,491
Why don't you shut your goddamn trap
and just eat your beans?

428
00:54:50,596 --> 00:54:55,363
Them, uh... There's possum
in these beans, and spices too.

429
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:57,901
- I tried hard.
- Well, Sally,

430
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,903
I don't give a pig's ass
what anybody says.

431
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,235
I still say you make
a hell of a pot of beans.

432
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,799
Now why don't you say us
a grace outta the Good Book, would you?

433
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:08,540
Thank you, Big George.
I'd be delighted to do that.

434
00:55:15,055 --> 00:55:19,082
"This day will the Lord
deliver thee into mine hand;

435
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:23,822
And I will smite thee, and
take thine head from thee;

436
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:28,026
And I will give the carcasses of
the host of the Philistines this day...

437
00:55:28,134 --> 00:55:31,763
unto the fowls of the air
and the wild beasts of the earth."

438
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:32,871
Amen.

439
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:37,969
- What's a Philistine?
- Well, it's just a real dirty person.

440
00:55:44,218 --> 00:55:45,418
Hello.

441
00:55:46,954 --> 00:55:50,154
I smelled beans.

442
00:55:52,893 --> 00:55:54,793
Who are you
travelin' with?

443
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,562
I'm with Nobody.

444
00:55:58,666 --> 00:56:00,566
Where you headed?

445
00:56:03,304 --> 00:56:05,204
I don't know.

446
00:56:10,244 --> 00:56:12,872
- Do you like beans?
- I...

447
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,006
I love beans.

448
00:56:16,585 --> 00:56:18,849
Have you got
any tobacco?

449
00:56:18,954 --> 00:56:21,923
- I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
- Would you give me some tobacco?

450
00:56:22,023 --> 00:56:26,357
- I would if I had some.
- I'll trade you some beans for some tobacco.

451
00:56:26,461 --> 00:56:28,952
I don't have any tobacco,
but I'd love some beans.

452
00:56:29,064 --> 00:56:30,064
Hurt.

453
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:33,534
- Yes.
- Eyeglasses.

454
00:56:35,537 --> 00:56:38,734
- Yes.
- Pretty suit too.

455
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,138
- I clean up real good, you know.
- Is that right?

456
00:56:41,243 --> 00:56:44,007
- Yeah.
- What size shoes are those?

457
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:47,344
- Ten.
- They look very comfortable. Are they?

458
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:49,850
Not too bad.

459
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:52,610
What kinda flower
is that?

460
00:56:52,722 --> 00:56:56,715
Well, it's a rose...

461
00:56:56,826 --> 00:56:58,726
that's made out of paper.

462
00:56:58,828 --> 00:56:59,969
- Paper?
- Rose.

463
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:01,490
Now you see there?

464
00:57:04,867 --> 00:57:06,767
- Look at the edge on that knife.
- Hmm.

465
00:57:06,869 --> 00:57:08,769
- Feel that.
- I'd rather not.

466
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:10,771
Aw, go on.

467
00:57:12,475 --> 00:57:16,809
That...
That is a very, very sharp knife, that is.

468
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:18,813
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. Yeah.

469
00:57:18,915 --> 00:57:21,544
What do you call it?

470
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:25,813
- Pretty.
- I'm sorry?

471
00:57:25,923 --> 00:57:27,823
That hat.
What do you call it?

472
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:33,428
I'm really not sure.

473
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,761
Ah, your hair.
Your hair is soft.

474
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:38,858
It's like a girl's.

475
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:40,869
By God, it is soft.

476
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:44,640
Now how do you
get it that way?

477
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:48,973
See, this old stuff of mine, it just...
Well, it's just like old barn hay.

478
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:51,673
- There ain't a durn thing
you can do with it.

479
00:57:51,782 --> 00:57:55,150
How do you... How do you get it
that way and keep it like that?

480
00:57:56,221 --> 00:57:58,815
Just lucky, I guess.

481
00:57:58,923 --> 00:58:01,153
Lucky. Yeah.

482
00:58:01,259 --> 00:58:03,059
Oh, yeah.

483
00:58:03,728 --> 00:58:05,787
Goddamn it.
You keep your hand off of it.

484
00:58:05,897 --> 00:58:08,092
I thought I told you
not to touch me.

485
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:11,498
I don't give a good goddamn what you told me.
You keep your hands off his hair.

486
00:58:11,603 --> 00:58:13,537
Why? What's that to do
with you then, eh?

487
00:58:13,638 --> 00:58:15,731
That's got plenty to do
with me, goddamn it.

488
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,933
- Really? This one's mine!
- That's right.

489
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:20,442
- This one's yours?
- Yes!

490
00:58:20,545 --> 00:58:23,639
This one's mine, Big George.
You had the last one.

491
00:58:23,748 --> 00:58:26,309
- Is that a fact?
- I saw him first.

492
00:58:26,418 --> 00:58:30,081
I don't give a shit who saw what
and who did what or who did who.

493
00:58:30,189 --> 00:58:33,386
You had the last Philistine.
This one's mine.

494
00:58:33,492 --> 00:58:35,756
If I want this one,
I'll have him, too, by God.

495
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:39,957
Fine. What happens
if I just shoot you then, eh?

496
00:58:40,065 --> 00:58:42,659
- What do you think about that?
- You gonna shoot me?

497
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:45,498
- That's right.
- Well, why don't you shoot me then, goddamn it?

498
00:58:45,604 --> 00:58:48,095
- I will. I'll shoot you right now.
- Come on. Shoot me.

499
00:58:48,207 --> 00:58:51,267
- I will.
- Well, quit talkin' about it and do it, by God.

500
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:52,777
I will.

501
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:59,747
- There you go.
- Good God, I'm hit! Lord have mercy!

502
00:58:59,853 --> 00:59:02,720
Burns like hell fire!
You son of a bitch.

503
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:05,017
I'm gonna have
to kill somebody now.

504
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:14,932
Well, goddamn it,
I guess nobody gets you.

505
00:59:17,203 --> 00:59:19,000
What the hell?
- Nobody.

506
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:27,375
Oh, Jesus' bears and squirrels.

507
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:37,355
I cooked, I cleaned, and I sewed,

508
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:40,950
and I have
a right to get...

509
00:59:43,864 --> 00:59:44,864
Yee!

510
00:59:54,775 --> 00:59:56,175
Hootka.

511
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:50,798
That's me.

512
01:01:05,148 --> 01:01:06,548
Wanted.

513
01:01:09,252 --> 01:01:13,314
"The brutal murders of one Thel Russell
and one Charles Ludlow Dickinson."

514
01:01:17,728 --> 01:01:19,696
I didn't kill Thel.

515
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:28,070
I didn't kill Thel.

516
01:01:33,911 --> 01:01:35,811
Your actions
are useless.

517
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,614
This is complete fabrication.
There can't be...

518
01:01:48,126 --> 01:01:50,754
You cannot stop the clouds
by the building of a ship.

519
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:57,893
What? What did you say?

520
01:02:00,672 --> 01:02:03,300
You know, I've had it up to here
with this Indian malarkey.

521
01:02:03,408 --> 01:02:08,368
I haven't understood a single word you've
said since I met you, not one single word.

522
01:02:09,614 --> 01:02:12,310
Are you sure
you have no tobacco?

523
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:15,113
I've already told you
I don't smoke.

524
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:19,624
If I don't smoke, there's a pretty good
chance that I don't have any tobacco.

525
01:02:23,529 --> 01:02:25,759
William Blake.

526
01:03:06,406 --> 01:03:10,467
I guess the best advice
just not to take any damn advice.

527
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:12,477
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

528
01:03:14,781 --> 01:03:16,840
What the hell...

529
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:18,550
is that?

530
01:03:31,699 --> 01:03:33,792
What's that say?

531
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:35,501
Read it.

532
01:03:37,972 --> 01:03:41,373
- "Wanted: William Blake."
- Huh?

533
01:03:41,475 --> 01:03:44,501
"In the amount of $500."

534
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,180
Shit.

535
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:54,254
Hell, ain't we about more fucked
than a whore at closin' time, huh?

536
01:03:54,355 --> 01:03:57,917
Thanks to goddamn
Mr. Dickinson, huh?

537
01:03:58,026 --> 01:04:00,517
I'll tell you what
that there says, huh?

538
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:04,121
It says some
pelt-wearin' trapper,

539
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:09,432
some stinkin' bean-suckin' possum skinner,
he's gonna collect that reward money.

540
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:13,574
Make you feel good?
Huh?

541
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:16,200
- Goddamn pelt skinner.
- I'll be damn.

542
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:19,405
Five hundred dollars.
I don't understand.

543
01:04:19,514 --> 01:04:24,110
I thought we was hired exclusive.
I mean, he paid us in gold in advance.

544
01:04:24,219 --> 01:04:27,552
I'm out here... I'm out here
in the middle of shits creek...

545
01:04:27,657 --> 01:04:29,557
with two local lunatics.

546
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:31,718
One who don't
say nothin'...

547
01:04:31,828 --> 01:04:35,195
And the other one,
he won't never stop yappin'!

548
01:04:35,298 --> 01:04:39,462
You gonna shed tears for us?

549
01:04:55,952 --> 01:04:58,216
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

550
01:05:03,394 --> 01:05:07,330
- And why not?
- Because it ain't good for your health.

551
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:11,467
Fuck you.

552
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:14,270
Fuck me?

553
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:17,339
Fuck you.

554
01:05:32,323 --> 01:05:34,224
Goddamn it.

555
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,360
Jesus, Cole.

556
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,630
He's just a kid.

557
01:05:42,867 --> 01:05:45,335
He's a Navajo mud toy now.

558
01:05:46,972 --> 01:05:47,972
Yeah.

559
01:07:03,683 --> 01:07:04,683
Aho.

560
01:07:17,665 --> 01:07:20,964
I have just ingested...

561
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:22,969
the food of the Great Spirit...

562
01:07:24,238 --> 01:07:26,138
and Father Peyote.

563
01:07:27,508 --> 01:07:29,806
Do you think I could have
a little bite of it?

564
01:07:33,414 --> 01:07:36,349
It's not for use
even for William Blake.

565
01:07:37,552 --> 01:07:40,680
Flowers of the medicine...

566
01:07:40,788 --> 01:07:44,246
give you sacred visions
that are not for you right now.

567
01:07:48,063 --> 01:07:51,157
My southern brothers were
prohibited from using it...

568
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:54,334
by the Spanish devils.

569
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,171
But now,

570
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:01,643
even the Notoemne
and the Dene...

571
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:05,977
know of its loving ways.

572
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:18,321
What?

573
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,720
What are you lookin' at?

574
01:10:06,372 --> 01:10:08,840
William Blake.

575
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:14,546
It's so strange that
you don't remember any of your poetry.

576
01:10:18,484 --> 01:10:21,044
I don't know anything about poetry.

577
01:10:21,153 --> 01:10:23,053
Oh, you're so modest.

578
01:10:32,199 --> 01:10:33,999
Listen...

579
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:38,103
I feel very weak.

580
01:10:40,974 --> 01:10:43,174
I'm hungry.

581
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:49,242
Quest for vision is a great blessing,
William Blake.

582
01:10:49,349 --> 01:10:53,183
To do so, one must go
without food and water.

583
01:10:55,122 --> 01:10:57,920
All the sacred spirits...

584
01:10:58,025 --> 01:10:59,925
recognize
those who fast.

585
01:11:01,795 --> 01:11:04,731
It's good to prepare
for a journey in this way.

586
01:11:14,976 --> 01:11:18,275
I seem to have
misplaced my eyeglasses.

587
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:23,883
I can't see clearly.

588
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:33,886
Perhaps you will see
more clearly without them.

589
01:11:35,931 --> 01:11:37,831
You're a very strange man.

590
01:11:42,604 --> 01:11:44,970
Very strange.

591
01:12:23,947 --> 01:12:26,507
May the Great Spirit
watch over you, William Blake.

592
01:12:57,782 --> 01:12:59,182
Nobody?

593
01:13:12,062 --> 01:13:13,462
Nobody?

594
01:13:19,404 --> 01:13:20,804
Nobody?

595
01:13:27,312 --> 01:13:28,712
Nobody?

596
01:14:30,277 --> 01:14:33,269
- Hey, Marvin.
- What?

597
01:14:36,283 --> 01:14:39,252
How come Dickinson's telegram didn't
give no description of the horse...

598
01:14:39,353 --> 01:14:41,321
this murderin'
fucker stole?

599
01:14:41,421 --> 01:14:45,050
It did, Lee. A pinto,
just like that one.

600
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:54,363
White legs, brown ass,
brown sides.

601
01:14:54,469 --> 01:14:57,267
It did? I don't think
it did, Marvin.

602
01:14:57,372 --> 01:15:02,002
Well, you asshole... You got the damn
telegram on you. Take it out and look.

603
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,772
That's right. Yeah, I got it here.
I'll check it.

604
01:15:06,447 --> 01:15:09,314
Maybe I been thinkin'
of them wanted posters.

605
01:15:19,727 --> 01:15:22,025
Lee! It's him!

606
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:29,365
You William Blake?

607
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:31,462
Yes, I am.

608
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:35,407
Do you know my poetry?

609
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:26,028
Some are born
to endless night.

610
01:16:45,016 --> 01:16:47,280
Well, Rome weren't built
in a day, Cole.

611
01:16:47,385 --> 01:16:50,684
Course, uh, I wasn't
overseein' that particular job.

612
01:17:23,922 --> 01:17:26,122
Fresh kill.

613
01:17:29,194 --> 01:17:31,890
Yeah. No damn tobacco,
that's for sure.

614
01:17:33,632 --> 01:17:37,660
This, uh, some kind
of telegram or somethin'?

615
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:39,670
What's that say?

616
01:17:41,307 --> 01:17:43,502
Dickinson again.

617
01:17:43,609 --> 01:17:49,104
Oh, goddamn Dickinson. You mean to tell
me he's even got the law involved in this now?

618
01:17:49,215 --> 01:17:50,415
Jesus.

619
01:17:53,286 --> 01:17:57,780
Tell you one thing. FL, uh, that there
Blake fella keeps on shootin' marshals,

620
01:17:59,225 --> 01:18:01,887
I'll wind up
likin' the bastard.

621
01:18:09,368 --> 01:18:12,270
Looks like a goddamn
religious icon.

622
01:18:40,134 --> 01:18:42,432
Anyhow, greenback
to the beginning of the story,

623
01:18:42,536 --> 01:18:44,801
my granddaddy come over
from Scotland, you see.

624
01:18:44,906 --> 01:18:47,340
He was actually part of
the Mactwill clan.

625
01:18:47,442 --> 01:18:52,812
Uh, the, uh, clan tartan was kind of
gold and purple, if I remember correctly.

626
01:18:52,914 --> 01:18:55,246
I never wore
a lick of it myself.

627
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:58,012
Dropped the "Mac" part of the name
when he decided to come out West...

628
01:18:58,119 --> 01:19:00,952
on account of he figured
it'd get him more work and all.

629
01:19:01,055 --> 01:19:04,616
How 'bout your family history
there, Cole? Let me guess.

630
01:19:04,726 --> 01:19:08,287
Kind of figured you for a German, huh?
I mean, am I right?

631
01:19:08,396 --> 01:19:10,489
Am I close?

632
01:19:10,598 --> 01:19:12,398
Austrian?

633
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:08,848
I'd like to speak with
Mr. Dickinson, please.

634
01:20:12,128 --> 01:20:15,825
- I insist on speaking
with Mr. Dickinson.

635
01:22:59,601 --> 01:23:01,933
Goddamn redskins.

636
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:39,326
Oh!

637
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,941
- Nobody?
- William Blake.

638
01:27:13,963 --> 01:27:16,363
She's upset.

639
01:27:56,206 --> 01:27:59,232
She's beautiful.

640
01:28:05,483 --> 01:28:09,442
- She didn't mean to call you that.
- Huh?

641
01:28:09,554 --> 01:28:12,648
But you sure interrupted
a very romantic moment, William Blake.

642
01:28:12,757 --> 01:28:14,657
Oh. I'm sorry.

643
01:28:14,759 --> 01:28:17,819
You stay here 'til I return.

644
01:28:34,178 --> 01:28:37,307
Don't let the sun burn
a hole in your ass, William Blake.

645
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:40,715
Rise now and drive
your cart and plow...

646
01:28:40,819 --> 01:28:42,753
over the bones
of the dead.

647
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:47,090
Do you still have
my eyeglasses?

648
01:28:47,192 --> 01:28:50,127
No. I traded 'em.

649
01:28:50,229 --> 01:28:54,495
- You traded them?
- Do you have any tobacco?

650
01:28:55,667 --> 01:28:58,659
No. I traded it.

651
01:28:58,771 --> 01:29:02,867
- For what?
- I'm not telling.

652
01:29:04,309 --> 01:29:07,642
- Liar.
- Thief.

653
01:30:16,718 --> 01:30:21,280
I don't care if you were
married 16 times

654
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:25,756
I still love you

655
01:30:25,861 --> 01:30:28,421
Yo-ho yo-ho-yo

656
01:30:35,504 --> 01:30:39,201
I will take you to
the bridge made of waters.

657
01:30:39,307 --> 01:30:41,507
The mirror.

658
01:30:42,577 --> 01:30:45,512
Then you will be taken up
to the next level of the world.

659
01:30:47,383 --> 01:30:50,181
The place where
William Blake is from.

660
01:30:50,286 --> 01:30:52,277
Where his spirit belongs.

661
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:58,086
I must make sure that you pass back
through the mirror at the place...

662
01:30:58,194 --> 01:31:00,094
where the sea
meets the sky.

663
01:31:43,674 --> 01:31:45,505
White man's
trading post.

664
01:31:47,678 --> 01:31:49,612
Indians get
diseases there.

665
01:31:50,914 --> 01:31:52,815
What do you mean?

666
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:55,215
Smallpox,
consumption.

667
01:31:57,388 --> 01:31:59,288
Blankets are infected.

668
01:32:00,558 --> 01:32:02,526
It spreads
through the villages.

669
01:32:06,531 --> 01:32:08,522
I see you have acquired
a new weapon.

670
01:32:08,633 --> 01:32:11,727
Hmm? Oh, yes.
A Winchester.

671
01:32:13,137 --> 01:32:16,106
- Here. Take it.
- No.

672
01:32:16,207 --> 01:32:18,539
No, really.
Take it.

673
01:32:18,643 --> 01:32:20,668
I took it off
a dead white man.

674
01:32:20,778 --> 01:32:23,906
Did William Blake
kill this white man?

675
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,752
Yes.

676
01:32:30,022 --> 01:32:31,956
William Blake killed
the white man.

677
01:32:46,338 --> 01:32:48,363
We need a canoe.

678
01:33:27,881 --> 01:33:29,081
Water.

679
01:34:06,521 --> 01:34:10,116
"The brutal murders of Charles Dickinson
and fiancée, Thel Russell.

680
01:34:11,893 --> 01:34:14,418
Also the murders of
the following territorial marshals...

681
01:34:14,529 --> 01:34:19,557
...deputy... Big George Drakoulious,

682
01:34:19,668 --> 01:34:25,072
Benmont Tench
and one Salvatore Sally Jenko."

683
01:34:26,475 --> 01:34:29,273
- It's not bad.
- Huh?

684
01:34:29,377 --> 01:34:32,039
It's not a bad illustration
of you, William Blake.

685
01:34:38,554 --> 01:34:42,251
Well, I want you
to have it.

686
01:34:42,358 --> 01:34:45,054
- It's a present.
- Aho.

687
01:35:02,879 --> 01:35:06,406
Good morning.
May you serve the Lord,

688
01:35:06,516 --> 01:35:09,246
and may His holy dominion
guide you through your dismal life.

689
01:35:09,352 --> 01:35:12,151
How can I be of assistance,
my poor man?

690
01:35:12,256 --> 01:35:14,156
All our ammunition
is guaranteed.

691
01:35:14,258 --> 01:35:18,285
This latest batch was, in fact,
personally blessed by the archbishop of Detroit.

692
01:35:27,004 --> 01:35:29,604
Good morning.

693
01:35:29,773 --> 01:35:34,005
May our Lord Jesus Christ
wash this earth with His holy light...

694
01:35:34,111 --> 01:35:39,777
and purge its darkest places
from heathens and philistines.

695
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:44,919
The vision of Christ
that thou dost see...

696
01:35:45,023 --> 01:35:47,856
is my vision's
greatest enemy.

697
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:00,470
Do you have tobacco?

698
01:36:01,573 --> 01:36:04,064
We sure don't.

699
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:07,542
Aren't those tins of tobacco
right there behind you?

700
01:36:07,645 --> 01:36:10,808
Sure are, but
those cans are empty.

701
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:15,379
There's no tobacco in them.

702
01:36:15,487 --> 01:36:18,786
Perhaps I could interest you
in some beads...

703
01:36:20,492 --> 01:36:22,392
or possibly a blanket.

704
01:36:25,097 --> 01:36:26,697
Blanket.

705
01:36:29,702 --> 01:36:31,636
Yes, my fine fellow.
Ammunition.

706
01:36:33,205 --> 01:36:36,072
Uh, I'd like some
tobacco, please.

707
01:36:39,111 --> 01:36:43,741
Well, I may have
one or two twists left.

708
01:36:45,484 --> 01:36:47,952
From my personal supply,
you understand.

709
01:36:51,057 --> 01:36:53,184
For good friends only.

710
01:36:59,833 --> 01:37:01,824
Good Lord.

711
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:05,770
You're William Blake.

712
01:37:09,009 --> 01:37:11,009
Yes, I am.

713
01:37:11,411 --> 01:37:14,346
By the grace
of the Lord Almighty.

714
01:37:14,447 --> 01:37:18,076
Sir, would it be presumptuous
of me to ask you for...

715
01:37:21,589 --> 01:37:23,489
for your autograph?

716
01:37:27,728 --> 01:37:31,562
Please, kind sir.
It would be a great honor.

717
01:37:36,203 --> 01:37:38,103
Pardon me.

718
01:37:46,113 --> 01:37:48,479
There's
my autograph.

719
01:37:51,652 --> 01:37:55,054
God damn your soul
to the fires of hell.

720
01:37:59,294 --> 01:38:01,489
He already has.

721
01:38:23,285 --> 01:38:24,685
Hootka.

722
01:38:28,624 --> 01:38:30,624
I'm tired.

723
01:38:36,466 --> 01:38:38,366
I'll free the horses.

724
01:39:36,795 --> 01:39:40,128
I see you collected
some more white man's metal.

725
01:39:40,231 --> 01:39:43,689
Yes. I seem to be
a magnet for it.

726
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:46,970
Oh, man.

727
01:39:51,009 --> 01:39:53,000
Good day for
a canoe ride.

728
01:41:31,913 --> 01:41:33,313
Nobody?

729
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:40,485
Is this the boat...

730
01:41:40,588 --> 01:41:42,783
that'll take me across
the mirror of water?

731
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:45,158
No.

732
01:41:47,162 --> 01:41:49,221
This boat's not strong enough,
William Blake.

733
01:42:05,914 --> 01:42:11,614
William Blake
is a legend now

734
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:14,245
He's a good friend
of mine

735
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:35,797
Stand up,
William Blake.

736
01:45:41,303 --> 01:45:43,203
William Blake.

737
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,040
Ah.

738
01:46:17,707 --> 01:46:19,641
Walk proudly,
William Blake.

739
01:48:23,337 --> 01:48:26,568
That man there?
I know him.

740
01:48:29,509 --> 01:48:32,501
He's a great builder
of sea canoes.

741
01:53:13,234 --> 01:53:14,434
Hello.

742
01:53:19,675 --> 01:53:22,542
I prepared your canoe
with cedar boughs.

743
01:53:24,947 --> 01:53:28,940
It's time for you
to leave now, William Blake.

744
01:53:29,051 --> 01:53:32,248
Time for you to go back
to where you came from.

745
01:53:36,091 --> 01:53:38,559
You mean Cleveland?

746
01:53:38,661 --> 01:53:41,755
Back to the place where
all the spirits came from...

747
01:53:43,032 --> 01:53:45,500
and where all
the spirits return.

748
01:53:49,139 --> 01:53:51,539
This world will
no longer concern you.

749
01:54:03,453 --> 01:54:05,444
Found some tobacco.

750
01:54:07,023 --> 01:54:10,925
The tobacco
is for your voyage,

751
01:54:11,027 --> 01:54:13,188
William Blake.

752
01:54:24,583 --> 01:54:25,967
Nobody.

753
01:54:27,614 --> 01:54:29,165
I don't smoke.

754
01:54:53,793 --> 01:54:55,774
Aho, William Blake.

755
01:54:56,305 --> 01:55:56,401

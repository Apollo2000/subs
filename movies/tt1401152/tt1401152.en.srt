00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,386

<i>Cab driver speaking in foreign language.</i>

19
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:46,342
<i>Cab driver continues speaking in
foreign language.</i>

20
00:03:51,368 --> 00:03:55,087
- What do you think he's saying?
- No idea.

21
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,121
- Oh look, Isabel Kronen is showing on Saturday.

26
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,320
- Welcome to the Hotel Adlon Kempinski.
- Thank you.

27
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:02,941
You take it in honey,
I'll take care of this.

28
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:05,604
- Have you stayed here with us before?
- First time in Berlin.

29
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:06,729
First time in Berlin.

00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:15,635

35
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,443
I’m afraid Mrs. Harris but the Eisenhower
suite may not be available right now.

36
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:36,343
What do you mean the suite may not be available?

37
00:05:36,444 --> 00:05:39,121
There have been some room changes
due to security reasons.

38
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:42,717
- But we confirmed 2 weeks ago.

<i>Clerk speaking in German.</i>

40
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:20,837
Oh please. Excuse me driver.

41
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,858
Come on.

42
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:54,866
Look out.

43
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:23,782
Do you hear me?

44
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:12,292
Doctor Farge. Doctor Farge.

45
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:23,962
<i>Doctor speaking in German.</i>

46
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:29,376
- I don't speak German.
- English?

47
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,765
American.

48
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:37,965
- You have been in an accident.
- Accident?

49
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:43,196
Can you tell me your name?

50
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,444
- Your name.
- Martin Harris.

51
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:53,291
Doctor Martin Harris.

52
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:59,333
Where's my wife Liz,
is she hurt?

53
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:02,467
- Is she hurt? Where is she?
- Doctor Harris it's alright.

54
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:07,001
You were the only passenger. The
taxi went into the river.

55
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:09,275
Your heart stopped for several minutes.

56
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:14,593
It's Thursday November 24th.
You have been in a coma for 4 days.

57
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:19,579
Thanksgiving .. But my wife
she's in Berlin with me.

58
00:11:19,755 --> 00:11:21,977
Where is she?
Why isn't she here?

59
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:25,776
We couldn't find any identification
with you Doctor Harris.

60
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:29,435
- No no no please calm down.
- Call her.

61
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:33,302
Where can we reach your wife.
Does she have a cell phone?

62
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:36,154
Of course she has a cell phone.
It's you um ..

63
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:48,409
- I can't remember.
- Can you tell me what you do remember Martin?

64
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:54,979
Bits and pieces. Arriving at the airport,
getting in a taxi with Liz.

65
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,838
I don't know how I got here.

66
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,078
There are no rules with severe
trauma of this kind.

67
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,402
Memories get lost or fractured.
Most of them return.

68
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:10,164
Although it's unlikely you will ever fully
recall the events around your accident.

69
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:14,916
In the mean time let us see if anyone has
filed a report looking for Martin Harris.

70
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,371
Yes, yes, yes.

71
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:31,819
Good evening. Welcome to BNI world news.

72
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:36,779
Brought this for you.

73
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,412
Has anybody been looking for me?
My wife .. Mein Frau.

74
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:17,538
Come here you.

75
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:27,013
- It's beautiful, just beautiful.
- I’m glad you like it.

76
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:37,544
She gave it to me as a gift
in Paris for our honeymoon.

77
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:22,497
Prince Shada arrived in Berlin today for
this years biotechnology global summit

78
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,003
The personal attendance of the
flamboyant prince has fueled

79
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:32,208
speculation that the summit, now in it's tenth year, will
witness the announcement of a major scientific breakthrough.

80
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,438
With the worlds leading researchers convening
at the luxurious Hotel Adlon in central Berlin.

81
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:39,720
Hotel Adlon.

82
00:14:42,317 --> 00:14:44,414
I’m here for the summit.

83
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:45,790
Nurse.

84
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:49,556
- You have to realize the risk.
- Doctor!

85
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:52,820
I've been gone for 4 days. My wife is out
there in a city she doesn't know.

86
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:55,701
She'd be terrified. I need to find her.

87
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:03,589
Sign this. It releases you from my care.

88
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:07,230
And here's my card.

89
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:11,381
Any nasauea, dizziness, difficulty with
speech, you contact me immediately.

90
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:13,664
- Do you understand.
- Thank you.

91
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:33,360
- Welcome to the Hotel Adlon Kempinski, how may I help you?
- Yes hi. I’m a guest at the hotel and I lost my room key.

92
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:35,274
I need a new one. ...

93
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,804
- What room are you staying in?
- It's the Eisenhower Suite.

94
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:40,423
- And may I have your name?
- Martin Harris. Doctor Martin Harris.

95
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:43,939
May I please see some ID Mr. Harris.

96
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:47,947
There's been a situation.
I lost my passport.

97
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:50,545
I’m going to need some ID sir.

98
00:15:50,546 --> 00:15:53,430
If you get someone to escort me to my room,
I can prove it.

99
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:56,088
Just give me a moment.

- Excuse me sir do you have an invitation?
- No ... i mean

101

102
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:28,065
- Let me check.
- I think I saw my wife go inside.

103
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:31,086
I’m trying to find her.

104
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,463
- Dr. Martin Harris?
- Yes!

105
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:41,584
Yes, there you are. I'm Herr Strauss,

He knows me. He can confirm
who I am.

110
00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:59,355
- If you will be patient sir, no problem.
- I’m being very patient.

111
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:04,972
Thank god there she is.
That's my wife over there by the buffet table.

112
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:12,840
I have been missing for 4 days
and she has no idea what happened to me.

113
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:15,519
So I need you to take me to her right now.

114
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:23,654
- Ok.
- Thank you

115
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:28,216
- The lady in the dark dress.
- Ok.

116
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:36,473
Excuse me madam. Your husband is here.

117
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,544
Liz. Oh Jesus...

118
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:44,165
Excuse me. Do I know you?

119
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:52,118
Liz, what's wrong? I’m sorry ..

120
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:56,754
I was in an accident. I was in a coma.
They didn't know who I was.

121
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,657
I said I’m sorry.

122
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:06,143
You must have me confused
with someone else.

123
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:11,954
Liz. It's me, Martin.

124
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:14,608
Your husband.

125
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:20,302
This is a misunderstanding
I don't know this man.

126
00:18:21,406 --> 00:18:25,612
Martin .. This is my husband.

127
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:30,055
You are Dr. Martin Harris?
Last time I looked.

128
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:31,941
Yup .. Still me.

129
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:37,630
What’s going on here?
Is this some kind of a joke?

130
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:42,479
- Joke about what?
- Because it's not very funny.

131
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,266
- Do you know this man?
- No.

132
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:48,649
Who the hell are you?

133
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:51,672
Who the hell are you?

134
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:56,769
- I’m her husband.
- Ok .. Ok.

135
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,506
Would you mind just getting him away from us.
Please.

136
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:03,034
Liz, please stop this.

137
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:04,961
- Hey, hey, please.
- Get your hands off me.

138
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:07,101
- Why don't you just back off.
- Liz what's going on?

139
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,987
- Back off.
- What's this all about?

140
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:11,408
- Why don't you just take a walk.
- Gentleman please.

141
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,697
If you don't leave now
we have to call the police.

142
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,990
Call the police. Call the goddam army.

143
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,598
That's a good idea. Liz, what's
happening here?

144
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,519
- You're embarrassing me. Please.
- Get him out of here.

145
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,175
- Liz. I was hurt.
- Have a nice evening.

146
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,417
Liz. Why are you doing this to me?

147
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:34,307
Right there that's Liz.

148
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:38,342
And I .. Am ..

149
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,623
I must have been outside.
I can't remember ..

150
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:46,990
Well, as you can see .. You are not there.

151
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:53,114
Immigration confirms the arrival of a
Dr. And Mrs. Harris on November 20th at 7:40 am.

152
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:57,368
At 8:50, she checked into
the suite at the hotel.

153
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:00,778
.. Followed by Dr. Harris
at 3:00 in the afternoon.

154
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:03,665
- What?
- Thank you.

155
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:09,943
He's not Martin Harris.
I am Dr. Martin Harris.

156
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:13,138
The man upstairs is pretending to be me.

157
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:15,381
And this imposter .. Did he also steal
your wife?

158
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:21,328
- He must be forcing her or something.
- And why? .. Help me.

159
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:24,239
- Why?
- For god's sake. Just do an internet search.

160
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,296
There are 400 Martin Harrises
in the United States.

161
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:29,641
We already checked.

162
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:33,402
Rod .. Rodney Cole.

163
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:35,797
A colleague at Langmore in the states. A
dear friend. He can verify who I am.

164
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:45,661
Please call him. Uh
it's 001-508-146-2595.

165
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:51,497
- <i>This is Dr. Cole. I'm having an ..</i>
- It's the answering machine.

166
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:56,057
Professor Bressler. Talk to him.
He’s the reason I’m in Berlin.

167
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,720
He invited me over to the summit to
discuss my thesis.

168
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,810
- You know professor Bressler?
- Yes!

169
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:06,512
Well we haven't actually met. But we've been
speaking on the phone. Emailing .. Dozens of times.

170
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,839
- Why don't you arrest him!
- For what?

171
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:15,165
Entering the country legally

172
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:19,385
Presenting all the correct documentation
and checking into the hotel suite with his wife.

173
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,421
Excuse me. With your wife.

174
00:21:23,091 --> 00:21:25,916
She is my wife.

175
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:29,851
Herr Strauss. I found a Dr. Martin
Harris at Langhorn University.

176
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,686
Yes .. Thank you.
That’s' what I've been trying ..

177
00:21:36,861 --> 00:21:37,911
Ok.

178
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,587
Wait, wait, wait .. Please wait ..

179
00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:45,240
You're going to arrest me?
I demand to speak to my embassy.

180
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:48,528
Unfortunately it is your Thanksgiving. The
embassy is closed until Monday.

181
00:21:55,893 --> 00:22:02,051
- Herr Strauss. Can I have a quiet word .. Please.
- Ok

182
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:07,852
Listen.

183
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:14,066
You're probably right.

184
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:19,944
The accident. I haven't been remembering
things very well. I’m confused.

185
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:23,414
This is my doctor at the hospital here
in Berlin.

186
00:22:23,415 --> 00:22:28,384
He warned me that this sort
of thing was gonna happen.

187
00:22:30,304 --> 00:22:36,304
I need to go back there .. Now.
I’m so embarrassed.

188
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:43,812
So, now you are saying
that you are not Dr. Martin Harris?

189
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:49,580
I don't know.

190
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:06,466
Please take him to this address.

191
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:20,351
Wait .. Stop .. Stop.
I've changed my mind.

192
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:37,419
- Need passport.
- Please.

193
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:42,656
Police .. Very bad.

194
00:24:49,882 --> 00:24:55,532
This is doctor Cole. I’m having an out of office
experience right now. Please leave a message.

195
00:24:55,909 --> 00:25:00,276
Rodney. It's me, Martin.
Listen. I’m in Berlin for the summit.

196
00:25:00,277 --> 00:25:07,370
But It's Liz. She's .. I ..
I don't know what she's doing.

197
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:14,204
Um .. There's another man involved.

198
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:19,256
I’m in trouble Rod .. Wait.

199
00:26:41,254 --> 00:26:42,645
Hold the door.

200
00:27:20,494 --> 00:27:23,194
12:30 p.m.

201
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:28,394
Professor Bressler.

202
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:31,908
Lab - University. Welcome party
for Shada.

203
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,994
He says he doesn't care
if she saved your life.

204
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:12,075
The bitch cost him twenty thousand Euros.

205
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:18,636
The insurance won't cover the cab and
she had no license.

206
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:24,734
He says illegal immigrants are
destroying German society.

207
00:29:27,235 --> 00:29:31,894
- So I’m guessing he doesn't know where she is.
- No one knows where she is.

208
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:37,978
Thank him for his time.

209
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,753
- Excuse me.
- Hey American. I’m sorry we couldn’t help you.

210
00:29:43,754 --> 00:29:48,642
You know where she is. I can tell. Look I
just wanna thank her, she saved my life.

211
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,784
I thought maybe I could give her some money.
I just wanna thank her.

212
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,917
Please.

213
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,885
You remember me?
I was in your taxi.

214
00:30:13,886 --> 00:30:15,794
I don't drive taxi.

215
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:20,646
I was in your taxi. We crashed.
I need to know, where did you pick me up?

216
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:24,374
Where was I going?
How did you find me?

217
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,878
Your friend Biko.

218
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:27,803
Gina, stop talking and get back
to work.

219
00:30:28,598 --> 00:30:30,660
Please leave me alone.

220
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:36,569
- Please help me.
- Leave me alone.

221
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:40,853
Thank's for saving me.

222
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,888
Excuse me. I need to find
Professor Bressler's lab.

223
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:58,744
- I have an appointment at 12:30. I’m late.
- Your name please.

224
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:01,563
Dr. Martin Harris.

225
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,823
- Wait here please.
- The Professor knows who I am.

226
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,011
We scheduled this appointment weeks ago.

227
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,743
What are you doing here?

228
00:31:50,926 --> 00:31:53,277
- Professor ..
- This laboratie's a restricted area. Who are you?

229
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,869
This man is not Martin Harris.
I am Dr. Martin Harris.

230
00:31:59,146 --> 00:32:04,638
- So what is this? There are two Martin Harris?
- No. Let me explain.

231
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:07,758
This man showed up at my hotel
last night claiming to be me.

232
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,780
- The police were called.
- I called the police you son of a bitch.

233
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:14,120
He checked himself out of a hospital.
Seems he was in an accident.

234
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:16,955
- Professor.
- Professor, should I call police?

235
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:18,289
Yeah, thank you.

236
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:22,241
We talked. You and I on the phone.

237
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:24,594
We discussed your interest in
alternative forms of propagation.

238
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:28,980
I told you about my father. A school
teacher. His passion for science.

239
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:31,463
We talked about your children.

240
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:34,655
About how much time you spend with
them since you lost your wife

241
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:37,144
Two girls, right?

242
00:32:37,145 --> 00:32:42,469
You told me their names.

243
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,918
I know them. I know them.

244
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:49,281
Laurel, Lily. Twins ten years old.

245
00:32:49,282 --> 00:32:50,900
About the same age I was ..

246
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:53,548
.. When I told my father I
wanted to be a botanist.

247
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:56,064
Do you remember Professor.
We talked about that on the phone.

248
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:59,367
- How I'd never seen my father this happy?
- No.

249
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:03,800
That wasn't you. Don't you remember we spoke
about how brave our wives were ..

250
00:33:03,836 --> 00:33:07,676
- .. To marry scientists.
- I told you about our honeymoon in Paris.

251
00:33:07,677 --> 00:33:09,234
My wife and I.

252
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,833
And how she wanted to visit all the
museums. All I wanted to do was go to the ..

253
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,058
Les ֹcole Polytechnique.

254
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:18,083
But she insisted. And that's how I
first saw Leonardos' Vitruvian Man.

255
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:19,908
Wow.

256
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,529
- This is not happening.
- Professor the police are here.

257
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,244
Moment. Moment.

258
00:33:30,245 --> 00:33:34,701
I don't know who this man is.
But he has taken everything from me.

259
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,316
You have to arrest him.

260
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:39,729
Go on arrest him.

261
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,472
I don't believe they need to do this.

262
00:34:15,492 --> 00:34:18,447
- Water?
- No.

263
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:25,172
Maybe I shouldn't do this .. But ..

264
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,020
My friend .. He .. Looks ..

265
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:49,053
He finds people.

266
00:34:54,485 --> 00:34:56,581
Martin.

267
00:34:56,617 --> 00:34:59,511
The mistake was mine. I should
have never let you leave.

268
00:34:59,512 --> 00:35:04,003
What's happening to me Doctor?
Confusion, memory loss.

269
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:06,166
Complete or partial loss of identity.

270
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,999
These are common stages in recovery.

271
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,371
A person can awaken from a coma convinced of
a reality that was previously only fantasy.

272
00:35:15,996 --> 00:35:17,996
We are going to sedate you now.

273
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:21,021
Do another MRI. Try to find out what's
going on, ok.

274
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:25,609
If I’m not Martin Harris why
do I know so much about him?

275
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:33,901
Perhaps he was someone you read about
or met once in passing.

276
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:38,126
Do you know what it feels like to become
insane doctor?

277
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:43,351
It's like a war between being told
who you are ..

278
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:45,376
.. And knowing who you are.

279
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:51,516
Which do you think wins?

280
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:02,015
Hello Martin, this won't take very long.

281
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,140
Excuse me. Where are you taking this
patient?

282
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:43,965
I have instructions to move this patient to
the American Hospital in Wiesbaden.

283
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,990
You can't take him until I get
confirmation.

284
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:47,815
Here's the paperwork.

285
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Show me that. I need to make a phone call.

286
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:52,616
It's ok. I'm feeling much much
better.

287
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:23,589
Hello.

288
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:27,231
Hello? Hello?

289
00:43:12,535 --> 00:43:14,096
- Herr Jurgen?
- Yeah.

290
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:24,652
- You met her?
- She looked after me in the hospital.

291
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,450
She was kind to me too.

292
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:30,960
I’m sorry. She's dead.

293
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:37,958
- Come in.
- Thank you.

294
00:43:49,688 --> 00:43:52,320
- Drink?
- No thanks.

295
00:43:56,804 --> 00:43:59,789
I was a former member of the Stasi.

296
00:44:00,061 --> 00:44:04,490
- The ministry for state security.
- East German secret police!

297
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,116
Yes. Proudly!

298
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:24,295
That's good. I cannot drink any
longer but I like to forget it.

299
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,544
We Germans are experts at forgetting.

300
00:44:26,595 --> 00:44:31,504
We've forgotten that we were Nazis. Now we
have forgotten 40 years of communism. All gone.

301
00:44:31,675 --> 00:44:36,090
But it's not just history that's
forgotten. It's people too.

302
00:44:36,562 --> 00:44:41,031
Please tell me more about
Nurse Gretchen Erfurt.

303
00:44:47,272 --> 00:44:48,842
Quite a story.

304
00:44:49,502 --> 00:44:52,016
For a moment they had me
convinced I was crazy.

305
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:56,490
But when they came to take me. When
they .. Killed your friend.

306
00:44:56,576 --> 00:44:59,544
I knew.

307
00:45:01,862 --> 00:45:03,955
I’m not sure how I can be of service.

308
00:45:04,408 --> 00:45:08,433
I need you to help me prove I’m .. Me.

309
00:45:10,873 --> 00:45:12,873
- May I?
- Please.

310
00:45:14,283 --> 00:45:18,751
It's a gift from my father.
I always have it with me.

311
00:45:32,074 --> 00:45:36,130
- These mean anything to you?
- No. It's uh my wife's writing.

312
00:45:36,448 --> 00:45:37,948
So they mean something to her.

313
00:45:42,554 --> 00:45:45,801
It's my schedule for this week.
I wrote it from memory.

314
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:51,828
Your wifes involvement in this. There
must have been something in the past.

315
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,673
- A new friend. An acquaintance?
- No.

316
00:45:55,444 --> 00:46:00,085
- Unexplained absence.
- No. There was nothing. I would have know.

317
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:06,032
- Men always like to think ..
- It's not Liz. I know her.

318
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:08,281
Yet she does not know you.

319
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,555
Look. Whoever's been doing this.
They've been planning it for some time.

320
00:46:11,612 --> 00:46:16,159
They have passports, credit cards ..
Family photos for gods sake.

321
00:46:16,734 --> 00:46:18,877
I mean, this takes preparation doesn't it?

322
00:46:19,451 --> 00:46:23,483
They have detailed knowledge of my research.
My relationship with professor ..

323
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:27,408
As well as the fact that you were going
to have a random accident that would ..

324
00:46:27,491 --> 00:46:31,202
.. Allow a stranger to seemlessly
take your place?

325
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:33,953
These people may be good
but they are not god.

326
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:37,107
A little confirmation would be nice.

327
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:39,732
Somewhere there's proof. They can't
have thought of everything.

328
00:46:40,112 --> 00:46:43,536
The question is why would they
want to take your place?

329
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,497
What could they gain from being you?

330
00:46:47,564 --> 00:46:50,711
What does your wife gain by
denying you exist.

331
00:46:53,403 --> 00:46:54,435
Do you believe me?

332
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,860
In the Stasi, we had a basic principle.

333
00:46:58,022 --> 00:47:01,873
Ask enough questions and the man who's
lying will eventually change his story.

334
00:47:02,855 --> 00:47:08,127
But the man who tells the truth cannot change
his, however unlikely his story sounds.

335
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:13,824
- Do you believe me?
- I believe you are telling the truth Dr. Harris.

336
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:17,249
I'll start by calling your colleague
at Langmore.

337
00:47:17,406 --> 00:47:20,688
As you say, it's Thanksgiving.
There's the time difference.

338
00:47:20,902 --> 00:47:23,767
So it may take time to make contact.

339
00:47:24,124 --> 00:47:29,322
- Then there is the question of ..
- Oh .. Money. Of course.

340
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:32,750
Unfortunately yes. Money.

341
00:47:34,274 --> 00:47:38,006
Of course. Here. Here's
everything I have.

342
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:42,053
I ll pay you in full as soon as I can.

343
00:47:46,373 --> 00:47:48,929
- For expenses.
- Sure.

344
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:51,896
I'll need 24 hours. Call me
tomorrow afternoon.

345
00:47:52,232 --> 00:47:55,346
And go find your taxi driver.
She should talk to me.

346
00:47:56,808 --> 00:47:58,867
She was there at the beginning
of all this.

347
00:47:59,226 --> 00:48:01,585
- Perhaps she knows something.
- I've already tried.

348
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:05,280
There may be details we've overlooked.

349
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:09,603
That's what I was really known for.
Details.

350
00:48:16,169 --> 00:48:17,006
Gina.

351
00:48:25,128 --> 00:48:27,784
I know why you run away from the accident.

352
00:48:28,295 --> 00:48:29,404
You're an illegal.

353
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:33,633
If the police have picked you up,
they would have deported you.

354
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:37,219
I want you to have this.

355
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:41,091
I don't want it.
It's worth at least 5000 Euro.

356
00:48:43,116 --> 00:48:45,816
Feel the weight of it. Go on. It's
the real thing.

357
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,020
E.H. to M.H.?

358
00:48:50,283 --> 00:48:53,572
Elizabeth Harris. My wife.
To me, Martin.

359
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:55,241
Special gift.

360
00:48:58,715 --> 00:49:03,477
- Ok Martin Harris. What do you want?
- There’s someone I need you to speak to.

361
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:06,433
- I’m not talking to the police.
- He's not the police. I promise you.

362
00:49:06,765 --> 00:49:09,245
I just need you to tell him what happened.

363
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:12,099
Anything. Everything you can remember.

364
00:49:13,577 --> 00:49:15,968
And I need a place to crash tonight.

365
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:22,420
Please.

366
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:33,353
?? Whichever is the first
thing to go.

367
00:49:35,678 --> 00:49:37,578
Airport security.

368
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:41,803
Herr Brandt, line one is for you.

369
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:47,528
- Brandt.
- Hans? It's Jurgen.

370
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,053
- Jurgen?
- From the good old days.

371
00:49:53,278 --> 00:49:56,178
Hans, you have to do me a favor.

372
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,823
I picked you up from the Adlon Hotel.
You wanted to go to the airport.

373
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:03,880
- You were in a hurry.
- That's it?

374
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,335
I'd just arrived. That doesn't make sense.

375
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,839
She didn't recognize you.
How long have you been married?

376
00:50:13,104 --> 00:50:14,539
- 5years.
- 5 years?

377
00:50:14,853 --> 00:50:16,819
I know it sounds crazy but it's true.

378
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:20,240
This is it. Sorry no elevator.

379
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:23,618
I know. Not the Adlon hotel.

380
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:40,976
The walls are made from
cardboard. But it's home.

381
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:43,741
I have to work tonight.

382
00:50:44,802 --> 00:50:47,013
You can sleep in there. I have extra mattress.

383
00:50:48,475 --> 00:50:49,724
It's quaint.

384
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,242
Would you mind if I took a shower?

385
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,751
You can try. I'm not sure you will fit.

386
00:51:58,998 --> 00:52:00,229
The light is broken.

387
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:03,461
You need to leave the door
open if you want to see anything.

388
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,279
I’m sorry .. I just.

389
00:52:21,688 --> 00:52:23,873
I give you a place to stay but that
does not give you the right to ..

390
00:52:24,148 --> 00:52:25,258
You're right.

391
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,858
They're good. Your drawings.

392
00:52:42,072 --> 00:52:43,224
You want to know?

393
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:54,975
This is me. 3,258 Euros and counting.

394
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:58,931
I get to 4,000 I can get papers.

395
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,098
So I can get the hell out of here.

396
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:06,293
- Sell the watch. You'll get more than you need.
- I plan to.

397
00:53:27,081 --> 00:53:31,612
- How do you sleep?
- Ah, he never goes for very long.

398
00:53:34,382 --> 00:53:38,836
- This guy Jurgen.
- He's absolutely no danger to you.

399
00:53:42,127 --> 00:53:43,628
Ok.

400
00:53:56,218 --> 00:53:57,191
Hello.

401
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,826
- You've got company.
- Do you have the keys?

402
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:06,618
Bring it back to my place. Leave the keys
on the tv and don't forget to reset the meter.

403
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:08,540
- You're the best.
- I know. Come.

404
00:54:12,946 --> 00:54:14,834
Yes, I sleep with every
American you send my way.

405
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:16,386
No need to explain. Heh heh heh.

406
00:54:35,961 --> 00:54:37,867
Biko! You're going to be late.

407
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,092
Jones?

408
00:56:58,942 --> 00:57:01,030
Biko.

409
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:56,773
Who are you?

410
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,001
Who the hell are you?

411
00:58:06,948 --> 00:58:11,023
Biko's keys. Give them to me.
C'mon, we can't stay here.

412
00:58:24,056 --> 00:58:25,316
This one.

413
00:58:40,087 --> 00:58:40,951
Are you all right?

414
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:45,210
That guy killed a nurse in the hospital.

415
00:58:45,919 --> 00:58:47,381
- What?
- He killed a nurse.

416
00:59:24,396 --> 00:59:26,696
- Left. Go left.
- Hang on.

417
01:00:06,247 --> 01:00:08,597
- Where is he?
- I can't see him.

418
01:00:20,097 --> 01:00:22,285
- Where's the wipers.
- To the left.

419
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:24,311
Oh shit!

420
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:44,306
Go.

421
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:25,996
- Get off the tracks.
- I’m trying to.

422
01:01:40,153 --> 01:01:40,935
Jesus.

423
01:02:06,137 --> 01:02:07,714
C'mon. C'mon. Go.

424
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:29,541
In here.

425
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:31,530
Out of the way. Out of the way

426
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:34,855
Slow down. Take it easy.

427
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:36,195
- We're being followed.
- Vladimir.

428
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,420
Hey, Gina?

429
01:02:44,745 --> 01:02:47,445
We're full. Calm down.

430
01:03:45,387 --> 01:03:46,867
Gina.

431
01:03:48,426 --> 01:03:51,063
You have to know.

432
01:03:51,088 --> 01:03:53,088
I have never laid eyes on those men.

433
01:03:54,382 --> 01:03:56,935
Why the hell did you have to get into my taxi.

434
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:58,910
I wish I hadn't. Believe me.

435
01:04:02,565 --> 01:04:06,034
And Biko. His family is in Africa.

436
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:09,162
The money will just stop coming.
They willl never know why.

437
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:18,492
Men like that. Back there. I have
seen those kind of men before.

438
01:04:19,805 --> 01:04:21,855
They killed my family in Bosnia.

439
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:25,505
My mother, my father, my brother,
slaughtered.

440
01:04:26,006 --> 01:04:27,265
We have to disappear.

441
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,318
Gina, they're after me. Not you.

442
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:31,332
Don't be stupid. They're after both of us.

443
01:04:32,204 --> 01:04:34,804
If they killed Biko, they'll kill me
just as easily.

444
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,233
<i>Are you ready?</i>

445
01:05:48,627 --> 01:05:49,671
Don't ask.

446
01:05:59,263 --> 01:06:00,205
Thank you.

447
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:05,997
I’m sorry I brought more
trouble into your life.

448
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,866
I will try and make up for it. I promise.

449
01:06:16,867 --> 01:06:18,487
I know.

450
01:06:20,258 --> 01:06:21,825
I figured something out.

451
01:06:26,137 --> 01:06:27,711
It's a simple code.

452
01:06:29,054 --> 01:06:33,281
The first number refers to a page in the
book. The second to a line on that page.

453
01:06:33,575 --> 01:06:35,139
The third to the words on that line.

454
01:06:35,564 --> 01:06:38,764
- What are the words?
- The Latin names of 2 plant species.

455
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:42,889
Calochortus Albus and
Umbellularia Californica.

456
01:06:42,914 --> 01:06:46,614
Ferry lantern and California bay. Both
common flowering plants.

457
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:48,339
What does it mean?

458
01:06:48,364 --> 01:06:50,564
That I don't know.

459
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,796
Not part of your work, or
professor Bresslers.

460
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:55,005
No.

461
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:58,850
Tell me Martin. How close are
professor Bressler and prince Shada?

462
01:06:59,122 --> 01:07:01,357
Very close. The prince is sponsoring
the summit.

463
01:07:01,662 --> 01:07:02,762
They're both progressives.

464
01:07:02,956 --> 01:07:05,105
Bressler wants to end world hunger.

465
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:07,630
He's uh researching new forms of crop
cultivation.

466
01:07:07,655 --> 01:07:10,655
Offering open access to his data.

467
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:12,364
The prince funds his work.

468
01:07:12,674 --> 01:07:13,986
He knows the world will need food ..

469
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:18,078
.. Long after his oil resources are depleted.
Those patents will be worth a fortune.

470
01:07:18,678 --> 01:07:21,210
But the prince's progressiveness
has cost him.

471
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,940
Extremists in his own country hate him.

472
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:26,053
And yet he perseveres his course.

473
01:07:26,078 --> 01:07:28,878
Despite multiple attempts on his life.

474
01:07:28,946 --> 01:07:32,886
There's a cocktail party before
Bressler's speech tonight, is that correct?

475
01:07:32,911 --> 01:07:34,511
Yes.

476
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:38,372
For some there might be a very good
reason to want to be you.

477
01:07:39,008 --> 01:07:45,004
Martin Harris with just a few guests in
a confined space with prince Shada.

478
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:56,539
Jurgen may be right, but we might
not be able to prove it.

479
01:07:56,992 --> 01:08:00,679
- I need to find Liz.
- Ah Martin, that is not a good idea.

480
01:08:00,963 --> 01:08:03,580
The people who have her have been
sticking to my schedule.

481
01:08:03,773 --> 01:08:07,632
- I know where she'll be today.
- Someone will be watching her.

482
01:08:08,464 --> 01:08:10,866
- What if he's there.
- He won't be.

483
01:08:10,907 --> 01:08:13,662
He's me remember. He'll be meeting
with Bressler.

484
01:08:58,379 --> 01:09:00,224
- Yeah?
- They've just sat down.

485
01:09:00,534 --> 01:09:02,994
Let me know when they leave. Thanks.

486
01:11:19,016 --> 01:11:20,301
He's coming.

487
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:47,591
- Liz.
- What are you doing here?

488
01:11:48,354 --> 01:11:50,460
- Liz, what's happening?
- Are you crazy?

489
01:11:50,494 --> 01:11:53,070
- You have to leave me alone.
- Why? You have to tell me why.

490
01:11:53,511 --> 01:11:55,730
Are they making you do this?
Are they threatening you?

491
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:57,909
How did you find me?
Did you followed me?

492
01:11:57,981 --> 01:11:59,523
When we arrived you saw the ad.

493
01:11:59,837 --> 01:12:01,668
You mentioned when we first
saw her show.

494
01:12:01,796 --> 01:12:04,032
In Chicago together. Don't you remember?

495
01:12:23,312 --> 01:12:25,554
- I can't get out.
- Come with me right now.

496
01:12:25,569 --> 01:12:27,740
No. They'll kill us both.

497
01:12:28,576 --> 01:12:31,508
I never should have left you. I never
should have gone into that taxi.

498
01:12:31,822 --> 01:12:33,271
You don't understand, do you?

499
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:37,809
Your briefcase. It got left behind
at the airport.

500
01:12:38,198 --> 01:12:41,212
That's why you were going back.
You need to find it.

501
01:12:42,494 --> 01:12:43,355
Wait for me there.

502
01:12:43,707 --> 01:12:45,223
Liz wait.

503
01:13:00,287 --> 01:13:02,122
I love you.

504
01:13:12,984 --> 01:13:14,437
- What did she say?
- Not here.

505
01:13:28,373 --> 01:13:30,181
We have to go to the airport right away.

506
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,780
- Is this Mr. Jurgen?
- Yes it is.

507
01:14:03,406 --> 01:14:06,903
My name is Rodney Cole. I received
a phone message from you.

508
01:14:07,072 --> 01:14:10,614
And I received 2 from Martin as well.
What's the problem?

509
01:14:11,274 --> 01:14:13,177
Oh dear.

510
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:15,454
Well that’s unbelievable. The poor man.

511
01:14:16,563 --> 01:14:19,518
Well listen. Here's the good news.
I've just arrived in Berlin.

512
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:24,511
Yes I've been teaching in Leipzig .. At
the Hochschule fr Technik.

513
01:14:24,603 --> 01:14:26,891
Sorry. Please excuse my German.

514
01:14:26,916 --> 01:14:29,916
Well I came up for the last day to hear
Bressler's speach.

515
01:14:30,001 --> 01:14:31,430
I could come right over.

516
01:14:31,886 --> 01:14:33,724
No no no It's fine.

517
01:14:33,838 --> 01:14:37,376
It's no problem at all. I know exactly
where you are.

518
01:14:37,486 --> 01:14:41,497
I look forward to meeting you Mr. Cole.

519
01:14:41,606 --> 01:14:43,620
Well then I'll see you soon. Bye.

520
01:14:50,572 --> 01:14:57,020
Rodney Cole. Leipzig.

521
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,176
- Herr Jurgen.
- Dr. Cole.

522
01:15:26,112 --> 01:15:27,620
How do you do.

523
01:15:28,702 --> 01:15:29,688
Thank you.

524
01:15:37,668 --> 01:15:38,852
Drink?

525
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:41,586
I have a bottle labeled brandy ..

526
01:15:41,611 --> 01:15:47,811
It is more than likely the vodka my
neighbor gave me to make her husband go blind.

527
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:51,507
- No thank you.
- Maybe some coffee. I’m making some for myself.

528
01:15:51,599 --> 01:15:53,379
No I’m fine. Thank you.

529
01:16:14,489 --> 01:16:15,952
You were in the military?

530
01:16:18,463 --> 01:16:20,802
In the Stasi in East Germany.

531
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:24,027
Well my grandson is going to be very
excited to hear that.

532
01:16:24,052 --> 01:16:26,652
He loves all this cold war stuff.

533
01:16:28,869 --> 01:16:32,830
- What kind of car is that?
- It's a Volga Gaz-24.

534
01:16:34,655 --> 01:16:38,055
Suspension of a donkey cart and
smelled like a?

535
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,480
Vanished as quickly as the wall.

536
01:16:53,049 --> 01:16:55,734
This business with Martin
is a hell of a thing.

537
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,032
How did he find you?

538
01:16:57,134 --> 01:17:01,414
- Quite by chance.
- I would say he was damn lucky.

539
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:03,553
How can I help?

540
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:07,747
Come with us to the authorities.
Have them confirm his identity.

541
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:10,212
The authorities. Oh, Jesus.

542
01:17:10,538 --> 01:17:11,925
Is it that bad.

543
01:17:12,065 --> 01:17:14,798
I mean the man comes to you with a story.

544
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:20,080
- Why did you take this case.
- Well .. Curiosity.

545
01:17:21,743 --> 01:17:22,812
Is that all?

546
01:17:23,385 --> 01:17:25,662
There's not much in this world left ..

547
01:17:25,788 --> 01:17:28,000
.. To interest an old spy like me.

548
01:17:28,025 --> 01:17:32,225
A few questions I still think over.

549
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:35,650
One in particular from when I worked for
the Aufklarung.

550
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:38,578
Our foreign intelligence wing.

551
01:17:40,634 --> 01:17:45,271
They used to talk about the European
based assassination unit ..

552
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:48,228
.. Called section 15.

553
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:52,632
Freelanced, reliable. Did work for
whoever paid.

554
01:17:53,082 --> 01:17:55,129
Public sector. Private sector.

555
01:17:55,154 --> 01:17:58,354
Second to none in their planning and
efficiency.

556
01:17:58,649 --> 01:18:01,569
They never failed.

557
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:07,184
And I’m told they're still in existence.
But it's only rumor, of course.

558
01:18:10,511 --> 01:18:12,596
You had time after I called you.

559
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:15,016
Why didn't you run?

560
01:18:15,116 --> 01:18:18,696
Where should I run from section 15 Mr. Cole?

561
01:18:19,274 --> 01:18:20,770
I can hardly walk.

562
01:18:20,995 --> 01:18:27,495
Before we could get Chesterfields, I
smoked 16 a day.

563
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,720
Filthy Soviet things.

564
01:18:31,552 --> 01:18:34,051
Killed more Russians than Stalin.

565
01:18:34,475 --> 01:18:36,658
My doctors assure me ..

566
01:18:36,762 --> 01:18:38,641
I'll soon be joining the list of casualties.

567
01:18:38,745 --> 01:18:40,214
I want to know how he found you.

568
01:18:40,223 --> 01:18:43,622
I want every name, every source you
contacted on his behalf.

569
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,751
And then what?

570
01:18:48,449 --> 01:18:50,649
We shake hands and you go away?

571
01:18:50,674 --> 01:18:51,874
Hmm.

572
01:19:23,332 --> 01:19:24,833
Cyanide.

573
01:19:26,272 --> 01:19:30,138
You never think you have
the courage to use it.

574
01:19:31,771 --> 01:19:32,960
But you do.

575
01:19:34,859 --> 01:19:36,697
The best of us do.

576
01:19:46,123 --> 01:19:49,750
What if he remembers everything?

577
01:19:50,351 --> 01:19:52,051
What then?

578
01:20:07,476 --> 01:20:09,876
May I see some identification.

579
01:20:09,901 --> 01:20:13,901
He doesn't have any. He was in an accident.
That's why the bag was unclaimed.

580
01:20:14,078 --> 01:20:17,679
- I'll take it.
- Wait. Wait. Please. Bitte.

581
01:20:21,098 --> 01:20:26,388
The combination for the lock .. Is ..

582
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:34,798
"2/8/0"

583
01:20:38,607 --> 01:20:40,212
"2/8/0/6/3/5"

584
01:21:33,553 --> 01:21:36,809
- Who am I?
- May I?

585
01:21:56,185 --> 01:21:57,558
We shouldn't stay here.

586
01:21:58,183 --> 01:22:00,835
- It's not safe here.
- Liz told me to wait here.

587
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:05,920
Where you going?

588
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:12,191
You got your life back.
I’m happy for you.

589
01:22:12,284 --> 01:22:13,893
Now I need to get on with mine.

590
01:22:14,437 --> 01:22:15,991
Gina.

591
01:22:31,383 --> 01:22:32,751
Thank you.

592
01:22:34,062 --> 01:22:36,828
It's more than I need.
It's less than you deserve.

593
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:40,552
For everything you've been through.

594
01:22:40,577 --> 01:22:42,277
Go on. Take it.

595
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:49,541
- What if she told them where you are going?
- Liz? She wouldn’t.

596
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,679
- How do you know?
- Gina.

597
01:22:52,284 --> 01:22:53,785
She's my wife.

598
01:22:56,434 --> 01:22:57,670
Yes she is.

599
01:23:02,285 --> 01:23:03,938
It's too heavy for me.

600
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:43,196
Martin. Martin.

601
01:23:44,234 --> 01:23:46,669
Oh my god look at you. How you doin?

602
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:49,491
Rodney. What you're doing here?
Well you called me.

603
01:23:50,505 --> 01:23:53,239
Don't you remember. You
left a message on my machine.

604
01:23:53,331 --> 01:23:54,841
I got on the first plane I could.

605
01:23:54,927 --> 01:23:56,341
What have you gotten yourself into?

606
01:23:56,366 --> 01:23:58,366
I'm sorry to drag you into this.

607
01:23:58,391 --> 01:24:00,691
Ah, don't be. We've been friends for
fifteen years.

608
01:24:01,676 --> 01:24:03,578
I know you'd do the same for me.

609
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,706
Here let me take that for you.

610
01:24:26,531 --> 01:24:28,631
Fraulein. Hallo.

611
01:24:28,656 --> 01:24:29,856
I don't have all day.

612
01:24:32,581 --> 01:24:34,781
Help me with my bags, please.

613
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:00,398
I've never had this happen before.

614
01:26:00,424 --> 01:26:02,811
You really think you are
Martin Harris don't you?

615
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,938
What the hell Rod?

616
01:26:06,593 --> 01:26:08,748
You're my oldest friend.

617
01:26:08,965 --> 01:26:12,789
You know who I am.
It's me. It's not this other guy.

618
01:26:12,882 --> 01:26:15,686
- He's not ..
- Martin Harris. No of course he's not.

619
01:26:15,942 --> 01:26:17,872
But then, neither are you.

620
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:20,058
What?

621
01:26:20,164 --> 01:26:21,927
There is no Martin Harris.

622
01:26:23,532 --> 01:26:25,459
He doesn't exist.

623
01:26:26,592 --> 01:26:27,715
You invented him.

624
01:26:28,636 --> 01:26:31,160
He's your legend. You just made him up.

625
01:26:31,185 --> 01:26:33,185
As a cover to get into the conference.

626
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:39,229
You're not making sense. Liz ..

627
01:26:39,598 --> 01:26:43,280
Liz. Liz is not your wife.

628
01:26:46,962 --> 01:26:48,710
You were a professional team.

629
01:26:48,838 --> 01:26:54,486
- No no no. This is insane.
- Your memories are not real.

630
01:26:55,046 --> 01:27:01,345
Martin Harris is a fabrication. You just
invented a life.

631
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:03,170
And then you filled in the gaps.

632
01:27:08,566 --> 01:27:10,596
She's right. You're really gone on this.

633
01:27:10,686 --> 01:27:13,467
She had to go in with a backup.
How do you think she feels.

634
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:19,492
They're gonna let her touch the? Someday.

635
01:27:19,905 --> 01:27:22,912
And thank you for retrieving the
briefcase from the airport.

636
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:27,618
Leaving it there was .. Untidy.

637
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:29,843
It was a loose end that didn't fit in
with our plans.

638
01:27:31,036 --> 01:27:32,655
You're gonna figure this out.

639
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:38,052
By the way. He's dead.

640
01:27:39,531 --> 01:27:41,185
And he died very well.

641
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:46,710
And I'm afraid that isn't something I'm
going to be able to say about you.

642
01:27:47,705 --> 01:27:48,979
I’m sorry.

643
01:27:50,108 --> 01:27:54,136
I’m really, really, sorry.

644
01:27:59,956 --> 01:28:00,886
Rodney.

645
01:28:03,402 --> 01:28:04,755
<i>What are you doing?</i>

646
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,380
One year of preparation.

647
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:24,217
We did everything we could
to make you come back.

648
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,164
Do you know how much time you've wasted?

649
01:28:26,268 --> 01:28:27,835
It's Thanksgiving.

650
01:28:27,921 --> 01:28:29,723
I could have been home with my family.

651
01:28:29,738 --> 01:28:33,776
Having dinner instead of
cleaning up your mess ..

652
01:28:33,871 --> 01:28:35,663
.. Because you bumped your head and
started to believe your cover.

653
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:36,852
Tell me.

654
01:28:38,624 --> 01:28:40,002
Who am I?

655
01:28:42,677 --> 01:28:46,551
You were a trained assassin. And
you were my best boy.

656
01:28:48,872 --> 01:28:53,438
And now your just gonna be another
nameless dead junky.

657
01:29:47,242 --> 01:29:48,987
Gina. Stay down.

658
01:30:17,474 --> 01:30:19,907
Gina.

659
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,846
No. No.

660
01:31:29,689 --> 01:31:31,122
Martin Harris.

661
01:31:31,157 --> 01:31:37,000
Married to Elizabeth Truman July 18th 2006.
Martha's Vineyard.

662
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:41,297
Father died September 9, 1987 of
a heart attack.

663
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:42,497
I made it up.

664
01:31:42,967 --> 01:31:45,625
I made it up to kill a man I've never met.

665
01:31:55,701 --> 01:31:58,847
Look, August 27th. The entry stamp.

666
01:31:58,901 --> 01:32:00,969
You were in Berlin 3 months ago.

667
01:32:05,824 --> 01:32:08,194
- Are you ready.
- Almost.

668
01:32:22,097 --> 01:32:22,924
Ready.

669
01:32:26,726 --> 01:32:29,662
Who are these people?
They didn't kill anyone.

670
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:31,421
They?

671
01:32:32,361 --> 01:32:34,466
We are killers.

672
01:32:36,288 --> 01:32:38,559
Prince Shada is gonna
be assassinated tonight.

673
01:32:38,751 --> 01:32:40,950
There's a bomb in his suite.
I put it there.

674
01:32:42,968 --> 01:32:44,918
You should have let me drown.

675
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:52,541
What matters is what you do know Martin.

676
01:33:25,791 --> 01:33:28,991
The conference guests are taking their
seats for dinner.

677
01:33:31,016 --> 01:33:34,216
Professor Bressler has entered the hotel lobby.

678
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:48,041
The Professor is making his way to the
Eisenhower Suite for the reception.

679
01:33:49,722 --> 01:33:51,422
Switch to the 5th floor.

680
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:53,642
Prince Shada has left his suite.

681
01:33:53,758 --> 01:33:55,958
He's on his way to the reception as well.

682
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,173
I’m so honored you could attend this evening.

683
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,105
The honor is all mine.

684
01:34:12,436 --> 01:34:14,037
Would you like a drink?

685
01:34:14,762 --> 01:34:17,762
In some circles, my husband is more well
known for his Martinees than his research.

686
01:34:28,074 --> 01:34:30,848
- You have an invitation sir?
- I don't know if I'm supposed to ..

687
01:34:30,956 --> 01:34:32,719
Leo, Lily. Come in.

688
01:34:33,608 --> 01:34:36,092
I don't think you need invitation to
your own reception.

689
01:34:36,215 --> 01:34:37,140
Good to see you.

690
01:34:37,699 --> 01:34:39,102
So good to see you.

691
01:34:39,729 --> 01:34:41,942
- Have you met our host.
- Not yet.

692
01:34:42,414 --> 01:34:46,386
- Hello.
- Now I can see why someone would pretend to be him.

693
01:34:48,275 --> 01:34:49,449
This way.

694
01:34:57,174 --> 01:34:59,674
I need security at the service entrance.

695
01:35:00,154 --> 01:35:01,293
Here let me take that.

696
01:35:01,584 --> 01:35:03,402
I'd rather hold on to this if you don't mind.

697
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:04,883
Oh you can trust me professor.

698
01:35:07,108 --> 01:35:08,708
Separation anxiety.

699
01:35:09,942 --> 01:35:12,634
- Just, leave it there.
- Of course.

700
01:35:12,661 --> 01:35:13,582
Thank you.

701
01:35:33,412 --> 01:35:34,334
Oh, excuse me.

702
01:35:46,007 --> 01:35:51,107
<i>Your slave device has found 1 hard drive.
Proceed to capture?</i>

703
01:36:29,472 --> 01:36:30,571
This way.

704
01:36:36,234 --> 01:36:37,519
Get your hands off her.

705
01:37:18,656 --> 01:37:20,495
There's a bomb in the Eisenhower suite.

706
01:37:20,603 --> 01:37:22,153
I put it there 3 months ago.

707
01:37:22,245 --> 01:37:24,909
I suppose now you are saying that
you are Dr. Martin Harris.

708
01:37:25,004 --> 01:37:27,174
You're not listening. Take me to the room.

709
01:37:27,253 --> 01:37:28,724
I'll show you exactly where it is.

710
01:37:28,733 --> 01:37:30,478
Up to the room in the middle of a party.

711
01:37:30,572 --> 01:37:33,665
With prince Shada and the worlds
leading scientific minds.

712
01:37:33,804 --> 01:37:36,080
Of course. Why didn't you say so before.

713
01:37:46,149 --> 01:37:47,264
I’m not lying.

714
01:37:47,489 --> 01:37:49,189
Pull up the reception recordings.

715
01:37:49,214 --> 01:37:50,414
From August 27th of this year.

716
01:37:50,498 --> 01:37:52,648
Do it now or many people will die.

717
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:05,022
I’m just going to grab my bag.

718
01:38:13,462 --> 01:38:17,490
Here. Why don't you just wear it.
Like some nerdy accessory.

719
01:38:21,159 --> 01:38:22,389
Thank you.

720
01:38:31,514 --> 01:38:33,914
- That's got all your secrets in it, right?
- Yeah.

721
01:38:35,789 --> 01:38:37,836
Will you excuse me I have to go to
the bathroom.

722
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:47,353
Stop. Stop. That's it. Do you see? Look!

723
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:55,799
Sound the alarm.

724
01:38:55,824 --> 01:38:57,524
Evacuate the entire hotel.

725
01:38:57,549 --> 01:38:59,549
We'll meet the prince at the service entrance.

726
01:38:59,574 --> 01:39:01,574
You two stay here and make sure they
don't leave the room.

727
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:02,799
Is that clear?

728
01:39:14,903 --> 01:39:16,091
Shit.

729
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:22,876
Find the target and finish it.

730
01:39:23,016 --> 01:39:25,077
We got what we came for.
I’m going to take care of the bomb.

731
01:39:26,233 --> 01:39:27,404
Forget about it.

732
01:39:27,508 --> 01:39:29,478
They have my image on file from
when we planted it.

733
01:39:29,582 --> 01:39:30,305
So what?

734
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:33,922
So I don't want my face connected forever
to an explosion we no longer need.

735
01:39:33,996 --> 01:39:35,136
Go!

736
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:46,677
Lily and Laurel.

737
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:50,182
Bressler's girls. Lily, Laurel.

738
01:39:50,412 --> 01:39:51,892
Flowering plants.

739
01:39:52,217 --> 01:39:54,917
Calochortus Albus and
Umbellularia Californica.

740
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:57,760
- The code from the book.
- They're his passwords.

741
01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:04,628
Bressler is supposedly working on a new
strain of corn.

742
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:06,573
One that can grow in any climate.

743
01:40:06,854 --> 01:40:08,085
It's revolutionary.

744
01:40:08,178 --> 01:40:09,959
If they access his research and kill him ..

745
01:40:10,082 --> 01:40:12,192
.. It could be worth billions in the
wrong hands.

746
01:40:16,105 --> 01:40:17,835
Laurel.

747
01:40:18,803 --> 01:40:19,852
Papa.

748
01:40:20,664 --> 01:40:21,723
Laurel.

749
01:40:21,955 --> 01:40:24,874
And if that bomb goes off it will look
as if Shada was killed by extremists.

750
01:40:24,965 --> 01:40:27,244
The Prince was never the target.
It's Bressler.

751
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:28,866
Listen, listen.

752
01:40:28,975 --> 01:40:31,754
You have to tell Strauss. They're
after Bressler.

753
01:40:31,909 --> 01:40:33,602
Do you understand?

754
01:40:37,124 --> 01:40:37,902
Go

755
01:40:39,726 --> 01:40:40,600
Out of the way.

756
01:40:41,298 --> 01:40:43,698
Move! Move!

757
01:40:45,699 --> 01:40:47,759
- Laurel.
- Papa.

758
01:40:48,913 --> 01:40:51,509
Laurel.

759
01:41:08,087 --> 01:41:10,972
Oh Laurel?

760
01:41:11,084 --> 01:41:12,204
Papa.

761
01:41:14,783 --> 01:41:16,667
She was running around looking for you.

762
01:41:16,697 --> 01:41:18,094
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

763
01:41:18,101 --> 01:41:19,598
- We have to leave.
- Yes.

764
01:42:05,322 --> 01:42:08,722
Christ, you really don't remember
anything, do you.

765
01:42:50,174 --> 01:42:51,215
Liz will be at the party ..

766
01:42:51,308 --> 01:42:54,243
.. Where we'll access Bressler's
computer and steal his files.

767
01:42:54,351 --> 01:42:56,284
The client wants this clean.

768
01:42:56,443 --> 01:42:58,596
He wants the material from Bressler's
computer.

769
01:42:58,689 --> 01:42:59,844
And Bressler dead.

770
01:42:59,953 --> 01:43:01,658
No one can ever know what happened.

771
01:43:01,777 --> 01:43:02,620
When bomb goes off ..

772
01:43:02,713 --> 01:43:07,369
It'll appear that Shada was the target,
and that Bressler was collateral damage.

773
01:43:46,117 --> 01:43:48,193
I didn't forget everything.

774
01:43:49,255 --> 01:43:51,656
I remember how to kill you, asshole.

775
01:46:45,118 --> 01:46:48,822
<i>Less than 24 hours after the failed assassination
attempt on the Saudi prince ..</i>

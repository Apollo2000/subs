00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:23,692
<i>Long before borders were drawn...</i>

3
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:28,738
<i>...before the reign of Genghis Khan...</i>

4
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:36,121
<i>...nomadic tribes have roamed
the remote Altai Mountains of Asia.</i>

5
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:47,841
<i>For over a thousand years,
these tough nomads...</i>

6
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:52,262
<i>...have used golden eagles to hunt
for the food and fur they need...</i>

7
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:55,098
<i>...to survive
the incredibly harsh winters.</i>

8
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,772
<i>And for countless generations,
this precious skill...</i>

9
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,068
<i>...has typically been handed down
from father to son.</i>

10
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:16,202
<i>But this relationship between man
and bird is finite.</i>

11
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,499
<i>Custom dictates that after
seven years of loyal service...</i>

12
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,085
<i>...an eagle
must be returned to the wild...</i>

13
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:27,046
<i>...to continue the circle of life.</i>

14
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,209
God is great.

15
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:52,215
You are an innocent lamb,
but this eagle deserves an offering.

16
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,118
My dear eagle.

17
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,496
The time has come for you...

18
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:26,249
...to fly up to the sky and be free.

19
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,252
We have been together for a long time.

20
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,380
And you have only brought
good things to me.

21
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,431
It is not easy for me to let you go.

22
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:47,020
But I will release you,
because everything has its end.

23
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:51,900
It's only right to let you go.

24
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,864
Fly to the sky.

25
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:03,912
The lamb is just for you.

26
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:07,457
This will be the last meal from me.

27
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,674
<i>My name is Aisholpan.</i>

28
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:52,311
<i>This May I turned 13.</i>

29
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,648
How were your classes?

30
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:57,567
Good. Straight A's.

31
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,466
<i>I was born in the Altai Mountains.</i>

32
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,053
<i>A child of the nomads.</i>

33
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,232
<i>I help my dad a lot.</i>

34
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:57,251
<i>We do everything together.</i>

35
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:58,920
- There it is.
- Where?

36
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,379
There it is.

37
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:02,632
Got him!

38
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:05,009
<i>I love my dad.</i>

39
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:10,473
<i>He's like a teacher to me.</i>

40
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,032
<i>My dad and my grandpa
are eagle hunters.</i>

41
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,252
<i>In our family...</i>

42
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,046
<i>...we have been eagle hunters...</i>

43
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,799
<i>...for generations.</i>

44
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,225
<i>It is not a choice.</i>

45
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:59,564
<i>It's a calling
that has to be in your blood.</i>

46
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,361
<i>When it snows...</i>

47
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,073
<i>...we go to the mountains
with the eagles and hunt foxes.</i>

48
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:14,036
<i>A hunter and a catcher
work together as a team.</i>

49
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,207
<i>We use the skin for fur hats...</i>

50
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,209
<i>...and warm clothes.</i>

51
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:26,174
<i>We compete at festivals.</i>

52
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,552
<i>I have become a champion two times.</i>

53
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:31,971
<i>Got into the top five many times.</i>

54
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,272
<i>I was hooked.</i>

55
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,483
<i>The horses...</i>

56
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:47,320
<i>...the clothing, the equipment.</i>

57
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,574
<i>Looking at my dad and grandpa...</i>

58
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:55,912
<i>...I want to do the same.</i>

59
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,641
Let me hold it.

60
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,061
<i>Ever since she was young...</i>

61
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,772
<i>...Aisholpan has been
fascinated by the eagles.</i>

62
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:24,273
<i>Hold this.</i>

63
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,235
<i>Please hold it gently.</i>

64
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,491
<i>She would watch her dad
feeding them...</i>

65
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:37,161
<i>...utterly transfixed.</i>

66
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:43,334
<i>She definitely takes after him, not me.</i>

67
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,295
<i>Sadly, that doesn't leave
much time for me and her.</i>

68
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:50,132
<i>But I don't resent that.</i>

69
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,928
<i>I just want my daughter to love her life.</i>

70
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:56,681
Great.

71
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,309
You're a natural.

72
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:08,192
It's being forceful, pressing.

73
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,779
<i>She holds the eagle with strength.</i>

74
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,324
<i>She's not afraid of it at all.</i>

75
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,247
<i>Maybe it's in her blood as well.</i>

76
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,463
<i>Because all the men in my family
have been eagle hunters...</i>

77
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,718
<i>...my dream is to become the first
eagle huntress in Mongolia.</i>

78
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:42,393
<i>Aisholpan's family supports her dream
of becoming an eagle huntress.</i>

79
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:46,188
<i>But there are more conservative voices
in the eagle hunting community...</i>

80
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,108
<i>who have different opinions.</i>

81
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:51,986
No.

82
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:55,865
- No.
- Girls do not eagle hunt.

83
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:58,034
Elder people disapprove of it.

84
00:10:58,326 --> 00:10:59,660
Men go eagle hunting.

85
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:03,164
This is the legacy of our forefathers.

86
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:09,128
Women are weaker and more fragile.

87
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,757
While men go eagle hunting...

88
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:17,053
...women are at home
preparing tea and water.

89
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:22,516
They milk cows,
process milk, make kurt.

90
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,436
It's hard for girls
to go to the mountains...

91
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:29,690
...and chase animals on horses.

92
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:33,110
They get cold.

93
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,416
<i>Aisholpan says she wants to be
an eagle hunter...</i>

94
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,419
<i>...to continue our tradition.</i>

95
00:11:56,634 --> 00:12:00,763
<i>People say she should not
be doing this.</i>

96
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,727
<i>So I worry for her.</i>

97
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:16,195
<i>But I think girls and boys are equal.</i>

98
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:22,284
<i>Girls can do anything
boys can if they try.</i>

99
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,498
<i>My father taught me...</i>

100
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,502
<i>...and I don't want to let her down.</i>

101
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,301
<i>I began teaching Aisholpan...</i>

102
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,679
...showing her how to cover
the eagle's head.

103
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,779
<i>Then she learned...</i>

104
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,449
...to pull the rabbit along.

105
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,091
Yeah.

106
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,642
After trying this...

107
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,686
...we tried calling the eagle to eat.

108
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,397
Where is your voice?

109
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,110
Raise your arm!

110
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,159
That's good!

111
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:58,714
She learned to fly the eagle
from the mountain.

112
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:05,679
Launch it this way.

113
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,893
Pay attention. Again.

114
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,564
Release. Again.

115
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,030
Okay, good. Congratulations.

116
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,032
Even some men can't do that.

117
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,496
Are you hungry? Do your feet hurt?

118
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,040
Are you tired?

119
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,668
Are you hot?

120
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,337
Are you hungry?

121
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,589
I'll feed you when we get home.

122
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,067
<i>We go to school by the Syr river...</i>

123
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:03,028
<i>...because there is no school
in our area.</i>

124
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,305
Let's play again!

125
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,517
<i>I live in the dormitory.</i>

126
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,278
<i>I've been living here
since the 2nd grade.</i>

127
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,739
It's been so long since
we've known each other.

128
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,782
We've lived together
for 5 years in the dorm.

129
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,702
I've lived here for 7 years.

130
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,162
We are all neighbours.

131
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:55,080
We study and work.

132
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,128
<i>We are at school for only 5 days.</i>

133
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,340
<i>On Fridays we go home.</i>

134
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,970
<i>My brother and sister
live with me in the dormitory.</i>

135
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,599
<i>I take care of them.</i>

136
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:18,646
<i>Good morning, teacher!</i>

137
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,773
- How are you?
- I'm fine!

138
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,858
I feel good.

139
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,361
<i>I have good grades at school...</i>

140
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,864
<i>...because I want to be
a doctor someday.</i>

141
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,203
<i>But right now, all I can think about
is becoming an eagle huntress.</i>

142
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,559
Is dinner ready?

143
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,647
Place the spoons. Bring the onions.

144
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,693
May God bless you.

145
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,533
How are your classes going?

146
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,077
I wrestled everyone in my class...

147
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,995
...including all the boys...

148
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,622
...and won.

149
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:25,671
One boy was sitting
and looking at me as if he was frozen.

150
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,965
Quick, feed this tough child.

151
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:37,725
<i>Until now...</i>

152
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,562
<i>...Aisholpan has been using
her father's bird to learn the basics.</i>

153
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:45,274
<i>But really, she dreams of
earning an eagle of her own.</i>

154
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,326
<i>Since she is serious...</i>

155
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,748
<i>...I figure, let her bring up her own eagle
and train it.</i>

156
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:12,050
<i>For a few days every year,
a baby eaglet...</i>

157
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,471
<i>...is strong enough to survive
outside the nest without its mother.</i>

158
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,347
<i>But not quite old enough to fly away.</i>

159
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,229
<i>Today, there's the rare opportunity...</i>

160
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:27,107
<i>...to seize a 3-month-old eaglet
from a nearby mountain.</i>

161
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,580
It is said that legendary eagle hunters...

162
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,291
...have captured their eaglets
in these mountains.

163
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,835
May we be so lucky!

164
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,424
There it is!

165
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,599
Oh my God, two eaglets in one nest.

166
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,602
Some good looking eaglets right there.

167
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,647
Do you see, my child?

168
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:09,650
There, next to that yellow stone...

169
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,860
...there are two eaglets.

170
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,576
They used to say the eagles
were strong enough...

171
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,703
...to bring you little
mountain goats.

172
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,081
Do you see them?

173
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,750
We're going to have to
climb up that side...

174
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,044
...and then descend from the top.

175
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,964
This is going to be tough.
We'll need to use the rope.

176
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,171
Do not be afraid, okay?

177
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,173
It's a strong knot!

178
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:20,137
Should I climb down here?
Toward that outcrop over there?

179
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,940
Just be careful, use your arms
to steady yourself.

180
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,234
Yep, that's the way.

181
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,614
Hold on tightly.

182
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:43,911
In the name of God.

183
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,371
Never let go of the rope.

184
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,791
Don't worry. Okay, go.

185
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,172
- Give me some more rope, Dad.
- Back, back. Steady.

186
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,144
Grab onto the stone tightly.

187
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,816
Don't be scared.
Keep on moving down.

188
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,362
It's getting tough there.

189
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,197
Let the rope out, Dad.

190
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,532
Give me some slack!

191
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,461
Just hold on tight.

192
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,593
Hold tight I said.

193
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,053
Yeah, yeah.

194
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,349
Go slowly. No more slip-ups!

195
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:56,733
More rope!

196
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:58,944
That's enough.

197
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,154
Are you holding on tight?

198
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,322
Yes.

199
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,368
Look! There they are!

200
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:08,787
I'm getting close!

201
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,636
Still more rope, Aisholpan?

202
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:25,929
Yes, more rope.

203
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,685
More blue rope! I'm with the eaglets!

204
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:32,936
You made it?

205
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,479
I'm really there!

206
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,772
A little more line.

207
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,278
There are two eagles
nesting side by side.

208
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:50,203
- Should I send down the blanket?
- Yep!

209
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,245
You got it?

210
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,165
Bring it over this way.

211
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,042
- Which way?
- This way.

212
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,212
Let it go a little bit more.

213
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,215
That's it.

214
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,556
Try to cover the female.

215
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,268
- Say again?
- Pull it.

216
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,436
What? The blue rope?

217
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:57,896
Yeah.

218
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,107
Here you go.

219
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,738
Hurry up! The mother is coming.

220
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,615
Please, please, more blue rope.

221
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:10,867
Please release more rope!

222
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:12,702
- Hurry!
- Don't pull.

223
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,705
She fell down.

224
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,749
She keeps falling away from me.

225
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,000
Keep at it!

226
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,961
Give me some slack on this other rope.

227
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,547
Let it out more!

228
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:26,716
Is that enough?

229
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,100
Hurry up! The mother is coming.

230
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,274
Shoo! Go away!

231
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:55,620
Caught it!

232
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,748
My child, is it ready to go?

233
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,667
Wait a sec, let me tie this off.

234
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:04,796
All right, ready.

235
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,339
Should I reel it in now?

236
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:42,417
We did it!

237
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,054
Now, let's see what we've got here.

238
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:01,561
Oh, God. Oh, God, look at this!

239
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,231
You did really well.

240
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,649
Was it difficult to get to the nest?

241
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,026
You've found yourself
a really great specimen!

242
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,280
All being well...

243
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,283
...we can start to train
your baby eagle this autumn.

244
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:57,617
This eaglet is a sign of good luck!

245
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,413
She will bring good fortune
to our home.

246
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:03,373
Pop it there.

247
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,375
By God, a little female eaglet!

248
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,557
So you took it all by yourself?

249
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:21,891
Yup, I went and got it.

250
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:23,518
It was tough.

251
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,729
I've never seen a nest
that was so hard to reach!

252
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:28,690
- Was it tough? Are you tired?
- Nope, I'm fine.

253
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,942
As for me, I got all sweaty.

254
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:32,902
I'm exhausted!

255
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,613
I started slipping on the rocks...

256
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,991
...but I grabbed the rope
and hauled myself back up.

257
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:40,577
You proved yourself today.

258
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:43,330
You were as brave as any man.

259
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:48,918
You really showed that nest
who's boss!

260
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,378
Thanks.

261
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,130
I already love this eagle.

262
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:56,926
I'm going to raise her and we are
going to the eagle festival together!

263
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:55,318
<i>Since the Altai Mountains are high...</i>

264
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,155
<i>...it takes a strong bird to nest there.</i>

265
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,369
<i>It's a very beautiful bird indeed.</i>

266
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:09,165
<i>So it matches Aisholpan.</i>

267
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:23,805
<i>She is a very brave
and courageous girl.</i>

268
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,773
<i>Weather forecast.</i>

269
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,361
<i>Weather will be cloudy,
without precipitation.</i>

270
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:42,073
<i>Wind speed will be from 3 to 8
metres per second.</i>

271
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,535
<i>Air temperature will be
8 to 13 degrees Celsius.</i>

272
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:10,226
<i>Dear radio listeners...</i>

273
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:13,855
<i>...from October 2nd to October 3rd...</i>

274
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,399
<i>...the annual eagle festival
is to take place.</i>

275
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,445
Father?

276
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,698
Let me compete
in the festival this year!

277
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,034
Oh, my Child, it's difficult.

278
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,203
Please?

279
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,163
Don't worry!

280
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:16,793
Does the eagle's neck revolve?

281
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,089
Its neck revolves all the way around.

282
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,174
Were you afraid
when you first touched the eagle?

283
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:24,634
Nope.

284
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,262
We would freak out like crazy!

285
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,100
- And you fly it from your hand?
- Yes.

286
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:34,352
- And it returns?
- Yes.

287
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:38,189
Do you call, "Hey, eagle,
come back here, please?"

288
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,108
What do you shout
when you call the eagle?

289
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:43,903
Huukaa! Huukaa!

290
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:51,578
Is it afraid of other people?

291
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:54,581
Of course! It can bite like this!

292
00:31:56,874 --> 00:32:00,753
We too want to be eagle hunters.

293
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:08,886
But we're afraid of eagles.

294
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,149
<i>My father taught me...</i>

295
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,027
<i>...so we went to him for advice...</i>

296
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,154
<i>...and to ask for his blessing.</i>

297
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,209
Aisholpan's very own eaglet.

298
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,631
This kind of bird is called Ice Feet.

299
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:45,798
Hard bird to catch.

300
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:50,345
Aisholpan is going to be
an eagle hunter.

301
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:51,721
Really?

302
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:54,265
Yes, some people see it as wrong.

303
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:02,607
We have been hunting with eagles
from our forefathers.

304
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,319
My father and his father...

305
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:10,114
...taught how to train eagles.

306
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:12,367
I have trained, teach her.

307
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:16,037
This is an important task.

308
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,918
Both are young. I will train them.

309
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,673
Can you give your blessing
to Aisholpan?

310
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,342
Aisholpan!

311
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:31,969
Hey, Aisholpan!

312
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:34,722
Aisholpan!

313
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:42,230
This is a hard bird to catch, my child.

314
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:51,239
Well, my child.

315
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,908
May God help you
pursue the hunter's path.

316
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:56,369
May God keep you healthy.

317
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:59,372
May you grow old like me
with yellow teeth.

318
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:03,209
May no bird escape your hands...

319
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:06,254
...and may no horse
leave you on your journey.

320
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:07,630
God is great.

321
00:34:07,797 --> 00:34:09,841
I entrust that eagle to you.

322
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,760
This will be a beast catching bird.

323
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:14,470
Let it get old with you.

324
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,974
Stay safe!

325
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:21,853
<i>This is not good.</i>

326
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:25,022
<i>This sets a precedent.</i>

327
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:29,902
Eagle hunters
will train their daughters...

328
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,905
...to ride horses...

329
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:35,032
...then hold a bird.

330
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,203
It is a shame to do so for the bird.

331
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,622
They do not know how to properly
approach the eagle.

332
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:44,500
The eagle is very picky about people.

333
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:47,211
It demands respect and courage.

334
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,464
It's not like you hold an eagle
and show off...

335
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,674
...and become an eagle hunter.

336
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:53,134
No way.

337
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:54,969
Anyhow, she will have to get married...

338
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,471
...at one point or another.

339
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:28,294
<i>When it's warm, we live in gers...</i>

340
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,340
<i>...when cold in regular houses.</i>

341
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:42,475
<i>It's all we've ever known.</i>

342
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:07,291
<i>Nature is great here.</i>

343
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,713
<i>It is like our mother.</i>

344
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,764
<i>Good morning, dear radio listeners.</i>

345
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:48,184
<i>Near Ulgii, it will be cloudy
with no precipitation.</i>

346
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:53,522
<i>Only four weeks left
until the long-awaited eagle festival.</i>

347
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:59,528
<i>Eagle hunters are busy preparing
their eagles for the event.</i>

348
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:01,822
Okay.

349
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:09,830
My child, I will teach you how to train
for the festival.

350
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:16,879
<i>The skills Nurgaiv is teaching
his daughter...</i>

351
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,757
<i>...strengthen the bond
between Aisholpan and her bird.</i>

352
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,221
<i>As their relationship deepens,
the eagle learns to listen for her call.</i>

353
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:28,516
<i>As they start to work as a team,
the response times improve.</i>

354
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:35,856
<i>Our region's people are
fully in preparation for this event.</i>

355
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:38,109
<i>We plan to present a beautiful show...</i>

356
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,277
<i>...for our foreign guests and tourists.</i>

357
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:46,701
<i>As the festival draws near,
the excitement builds across the region.</i>

358
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:51,372
<i>This is an important opportunity for
eagle hunters to honour their tradition...</i>

359
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:56,002
<i>...represent the tribe, and parade
themselves in front of an eager crowd.</i>

360
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,169
Aisholpan!

361
00:38:58,379 --> 00:38:59,380
Let's go.

362
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:03,634
I will show you how to call it
from those rocks.

363
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:07,096
Probably the most important part
of the festival.

364
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:08,264
Let's go.

365
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:16,105
Release!

366
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,113
Congratulations! The bird did well.

367
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:27,450
My child, now you need
to call the bird yourself.

368
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,827
I'll be up there.

369
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,830
Okay, raise your hand and shout!

370
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:38,836
<i>With calling...</i>

371
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,296
<i>...the judges look at...</i>

372
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:42,048
<i>...horse riding style...</i>

373
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,841
<i>...eagle's landing...</i>

374
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:45,384
<i>...and eagle flying style.</i>

375
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,512
<i>This process is timed
and every second counts.</i>

376
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,473
- Get ready.
- Okay.

377
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,631
<i>Seeing her bird land beautifully
on her arm...</i>

378
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:28,511
...I realised that she is ready.

379
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,336
Don't hurry. Eat slowly.

380
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:15,891
Ready for tomorrow?

381
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:18,018
There will be lots of people tomorrow.

382
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:19,979
Are you ready?

383
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,067
Everything will be good.

384
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:28,279
Are you full now?

385
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,451
Don't be angry. Are you full now?

386
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:36,787
Don't be angry.

387
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:50,426
Don't make such noises.

388
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,804
You have an important
festival tomorrow.

389
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,559
You might not be able to fly
if you eat too much.

390
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:11,947
Do you want me to paint your nails?

391
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:13,866
If you do not mind.

392
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:25,419
When do you leave?

393
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:27,129
Tomorrow.

394
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,216
Will there be any other girls?

395
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:32,760
No. Just me.

396
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,095
Mostly older men.

397
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:50,402
Okay, my child, we have to leave soon.

398
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:53,739
It is a long ride.

399
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:59,161
Come, my eagle, come, your eagle.

400
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:02,039
<i>I'm worried for her.</i>

401
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,793
<i>This is her first festival.</i>

402
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:10,798
You need to take better care
of your hair.

403
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:21,392
Be the head of this home
while I am away, okay?

404
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:31,860
<i>She decided on her own
to be an eagle hunter.</i>

405
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:36,991
<i>And I believe
it's a woman's right to choose.</i>

406
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:40,869
<i>There are so many strong
eagle hunter men.</i>

407
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:46,458
<i>All I wish for is her
safety and wellbeing.</i>

408
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:48,377
Is this okay? Not too tight?

409
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:50,504
Be careful when you ride.

410
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,714
Let me look.

411
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:19,366
We should have cut it shorter.

412
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:23,537
It's okay, it's girl's hair!

413
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:30,377
In the name of God.

414
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,137
All the best, stay safe!

415
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:43,182
Okay, good luck!

416
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:12,169
<i>Aisholpan and her father...</i>

417
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:15,255
<i>...made the long journey
to the festival on horseback...</i>

418
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:18,175
<i>...carrying their 15-pound birds.</i>

419
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:33,232
Let's let the horses drink.
They must be tired.

420
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:36,652
- Are you tired?
- Nah.

421
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:40,072
God willing, we are almost there.

422
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:51,208
<i>The provincial capital of Olgii lies
in the foothills of the Altai Mountain...</i>

423
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:54,545
<i>...a full day's ride from
the family's winter home.</i>

424
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:58,966
<i>It's the biggest town
for a hundred miles.</i>

425
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,178
<i>A visit to Olgii is a rare treat
for Aisholpan.</i>

426
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:11,687
<i>Sometimes I worry...</i>

427
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:14,314
<i>...people might think it's strange...</i>

428
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:18,610
<i>...because she does something
that men usually do.</i>

429
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:25,909
<i>But she shows extraordinary strength...</i>

430
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:29,329
<i>...regardless of her gender.</i>

431
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:39,965
<i>Good morning, dear radio listeners.</i>

432
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:43,177
<i>The day of the eagle festival is upon us!</i>

433
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:47,139
<i>We are all hugely excited.</i>

434
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:50,684
<i>Around 70 eagle hunters
from all over the region...</i>

435
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:54,396
<i>...are currently making their way
to the festival ground.</i>

436
00:46:55,647 --> 00:47:00,319
<i>Sayak Tobi, the eagle
trainer's mountain.</i>

437
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:03,030
<i>For decades, this unique
rock formation...</i>

438
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:06,492
<i>...has provided a natural arena
for the annual eagle festival.</i>

439
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:08,744
You see, my child.

440
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:11,288
There it is.

441
00:47:11,455 --> 00:47:13,081
People are here already.

442
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:37,731
<i>For years, proud men
have brought their eagles here...</i>

443
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,149
<i>...to preserve tradition...</i>

444
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:43,946
<i>...and battle for the title
of champion eagle hunter.</i>

445
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:54,289
<i>No girl has ever competed
in the history of this festival.</i>

446
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:58,043
<i>And Aisholpan is
arriving unannounced.</i>

447
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:31,535
Peace be with you,
dear festival participants.

448
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:38,083
Our people have found
their fortune in the sky.

449
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:42,713
Our men have found
a way to stand out...

450
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:45,924
...and find happiness
through the centuries.

451
00:48:47,593 --> 00:48:50,679
Welcome to the eagle festival.

452
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:03,775
What a beauty it is to see
a bird in the sky...

453
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:07,321
...a fox on the land...

454
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,031
...and a fast horse.

455
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:19,750
We have an 80-year-old
eagle-hunter among us.

456
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,770
Do not be afraid, okay?

457
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,821
She is a young girl.

458
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:05,379
Contestants...

459
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:06,880
...take your places please.

460
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:13,178
<i>People come from all over the world.</i>

461
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:17,557
<i>The winner must be the best...</i>

462
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:21,228
<i>...among 70 great eagle hunters.</i>

463
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,729
Time to start!

464
00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:41,498
Here are the eagle hunters...

465
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:44,209
...who have made us
known to the world.

466
00:50:49,423 --> 00:50:54,428
They are the ones
who have cared for eagles...

467
00:50:54,594 --> 00:51:00,892
...passed down to us
from our great ancestors.

468
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:06,064
Please give your applause...

469
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:10,360
...to these highly honoured
eagle hunters.

470
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:15,073
Peace be upon you.
Let Ongarbay come forward.

471
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:25,125
<i>They begin with judging
the hunter's outfit.</i>

472
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:29,671
10-10-10-8.

473
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:32,924
<i>They assess the horse...</i>

474
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:35,177
<i>...the clothes and equipment.</i>

475
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:39,931
6-8-10-10.

476
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:01,286
Next is Ardak...

477
00:52:01,453 --> 00:52:05,540
...son of a famed eagle
hunter from Altai.

478
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:07,250
10-10-10-10.

479
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:10,921
Really nice! Great!

480
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,385
Next, we have an eagle
hunter from Altai.

481
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,849
Let's go.

482
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:24,559
Stand over here.

483
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,229
Make it fit your head.

484
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:29,606
Let me look.

485
00:52:30,357 --> 00:52:32,609
- Who is next you say?
- Aisholpan.

486
00:52:32,776 --> 00:52:34,194
Aisholpan is that girl?

487
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:37,823
- Come here. Come here.
- Do not worry.

488
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:41,326
- Please hurry up. Hurry up.
- Ready.

489
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:42,536
You are awesome.

490
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:05,976
<i>Since Aisholpan is a girl...</i>

491
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,896
<i>...it was important to make sure...</i>

492
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:11,815
<i>...her riding and hunting
styles are flawless.</i>

493
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:35,505
Awesome.

494
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:39,593
That was good.

495
00:53:41,803 --> 00:53:42,846
Next event...

496
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:45,015
..."Calling."

497
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:51,354
An animal skin target...

498
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:55,066
...attracts the eagles...

499
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:58,486
...and we measure their speed.

500
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:07,162
<i>Aisholpan calls.</i>

501
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:08,914
<i>I release the eagle.</i>

502
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:14,169
8-10-8-6.

503
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:26,681
<i>When you perform for the first time...</i>

504
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,350
<i>...you become very nervous.</i>

505
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:33,772
<i>So I was worrying for her.</i>

506
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:40,862
Next is Aisholpan.

507
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:43,782
Here we go!

508
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:49,621
<i>I told her to be careful with the horse.</i>

509
00:54:50,372 --> 00:54:52,540
<i>It can get scared and run into
the crowd of people.</i>

510
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:57,462
Where is your voice?

511
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,590
In the name of God.

512
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,068
Go fast!

513
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,924
Really nice! Great!

514
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:02,318
Guests, you are invited
for tea and lunch.

515
00:56:11,828 --> 00:56:12,871
In the name of God.

516
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:17,083
Aisholpan's bird flew very well.

517
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:18,835
Didn't it?

518
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:24,591
- This bird is very special.
- Simply amazing, how well it flew.

519
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:34,976
All birds flew well.

520
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:39,022
Not everyone who has
an eagle at home...

521
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:41,357
...is a real eagle hunter.

522
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:43,943
Women are not supposed to do it.

523
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:46,488
You can relax at home.

524
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:50,533
This is just the beginning.

525
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,371
This is just the beginning.

526
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:58,625
More to come.

527
00:57:04,047 --> 00:57:05,757
This event tests our eagle
hunters' ability...

528
00:57:05,924 --> 00:57:07,217
...to call a bird from afar.

529
00:57:10,804 --> 00:57:13,139
When the blue flag drops...

530
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:14,849
...release your eagles.

531
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:24,776
Speed and skill are
the most important part of this event.

532
00:57:26,736 --> 00:57:28,488
This is the only event...

533
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:30,740
...where people's eyes
are genuinely full of fire.

534
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:35,328
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

535
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,414
Your applause please.

536
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:43,378
Who's next? Who's the next person?

537
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:49,634
It won't go where it is supposed to.

538
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:00,019
<i>We worry that our birds...</i>

539
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:02,188
<i>...may not land in our hands...</i>

540
00:58:02,355 --> 00:58:03,857
<i>...when we call them
in front of a crowd.</i>

541
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,692
Hey, that eagle flew away!

542
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:07,235
Why don't you run and get it!

543
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:10,864
<i>Everyone starts laughing at you.</i>

544
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,746
Satibaldy has issues with his eagle.

545
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:20,373
Let the next one get ready.

546
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,172
Who's next?

547
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:14,636
Come on, Aisholpan. Let's go.

548
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:20,725
- Raise your arm.
- Don't worry.

549
00:59:20,892 --> 00:59:21,935
Loud voice!

550
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,272
Look at the flag!

551
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:33,863
You're up after the old man.

552
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,366
My heart is beating fast.

553
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:50,546
A very good score! Really nice!

554
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:01,432
Where's my dad? Is he up there?

555
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:02,892
Yes, he's already up there.

556
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:05,186
Aisholpan!

557
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:09,399
Whose bird is that?

558
01:00:09,565 --> 01:00:10,775
Aisholpan's.

559
01:00:10,942 --> 01:00:11,985
A lady.

560
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:13,987
Women are supposed to stay indoors
and quarrel for the gifts after parties...

561
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:16,489
...while men are meant for the outdoors,
and we quarrel for the catch.

562
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,705
<i>I was worried of course.</i>

563
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:26,541
<i>I figured...</i>

564
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:29,335
...it's all in God's hands.

565
01:00:34,382 --> 01:00:36,968
Aisholpan, the youngest participant
and the first female...

566
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:38,803
...in this eagle hunting festival.

567
01:01:00,283 --> 01:01:03,161
Great! Amazing!

568
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:04,871
Come on!

569
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:09,208
Amazing! Great! This is awesome.

570
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,337
Run towards your daughter, man!

571
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:15,006
Her bird was the only one
to do it in 5 seconds!

572
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:17,550
Aisholpan may have a record time.

573
01:01:18,593 --> 01:01:22,055
<i>Everyone saw it, both the audience
and the judges.</i>

574
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:26,642
<i>She managed to catch the bird
in her hand in only five seconds.</i>

575
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:31,522
That requires unique talent.
Not just anyone can do that.

576
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:34,400
I'm kind of trembling.

577
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:37,111
My hands are trembling.

578
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:39,739
Funny feeling!

579
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:41,908
Dad!

580
01:01:42,075 --> 01:01:44,369
Come here, my daughter.
Stand by me.

581
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:56,047
<i>Her bird was fastest and actually
broke the record for speed.</i>

582
01:01:57,131 --> 01:02:02,762
<i>When I heard this, I felt so proud.</i>

583
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:21,197
Eagle hunters, please come forward.

584
01:02:24,534 --> 01:02:26,702
Listen, ladies and gentlemen.

585
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:28,871
Today's event was special...

586
01:02:29,038 --> 01:02:32,125
...because a little girl participated
in this celebration.

587
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:37,839
Please make some space.
We will now award the eagle hunters.

588
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:39,549
As the saying goes:

589
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:43,553
"If two old ladies compete,
one has to be first."

590
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:47,098
Therefore, let me start with
the third place.

591
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:50,518
Third place goes to Nurbolat Tana.

592
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,777
Second place, Orazkhan.

593
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:04,407
Dear people, please listen.

594
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:10,997
Our winner today is...

595
01:03:11,164 --> 01:03:12,790
...Aisholpan!

596
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:23,843
Aisholpan is our winner!

597
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:40,401
May your art prosper.

598
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,070
May our offspring be like her!

599
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:45,656
Congratulations.

600
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:52,205
<i>I was so happy.</i>

601
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:54,499
<i>I had tears in my eyes.</i>

602
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:14,936
The 13 year old girl won the contest.

603
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:17,522
But I don't believe it myself.

604
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:19,273
She won.

605
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,109
Of course it helps that she is a girl.

606
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:24,487
Interesting for tourists, of course.

607
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:26,864
She came in first today...

608
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:28,449
...but to say...

609
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:33,538
...that she can eagle hunt
in the mountains in winter...

610
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:37,166
...I have my doubts.

611
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:42,380
To hunt, one must travel
far into the mountains.

612
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:45,841
There will be snow, storms, etc.

613
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,426
Yes, that is a real test.

614
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:49,595
It is tough. She won't endure.

615
01:04:49,762 --> 01:04:54,642
If she can go eagle hunting
in winter...

616
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:59,230
...then she is a true eagle hunter.

617
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:02,858
It is proof of a sort.

618
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:23,713
<i>Some of the hunters...</i>

619
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:26,966
<i>...refused to accept her
as a real eagle hunter.</i>

620
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:34,682
As for the jealous ones, it's okay.

621
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,892
Not all people are same.

622
01:05:56,746 --> 01:06:01,751
<i>I will prove that I am
a real eagle huntress.</i>

623
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:11,552
Dad, we haven't had tea
since this morning.

624
01:06:13,596 --> 01:06:15,014
Bring tea!

625
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:20,227
Daddy, when will we go hunting?

626
01:06:20,478 --> 01:06:21,687
We will go hunting...

627
01:06:22,063 --> 01:06:24,190
...in 6 or 7 days.

628
01:06:31,364 --> 01:06:34,992
<i>So we put horseshoes on the horses...</i>

629
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:40,915
<i>...and prepared for the ice and snow.</i>

630
01:06:52,385 --> 01:06:54,261
<i>To fully test her hunting skills...</i>

631
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:59,225
<i>...Nurgaiv must take Aisholpan deeper
into the mountains than ever before.</i>

632
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:03,854
<i>But first, they stop off for guidance
at the home of a master eagle hunter...</i>

633
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:08,526
<i>...in a remote village close to
the Mongolian border with China.</i>

634
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:20,162
How are you? Please come in.

635
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:36,345
You've travelled a long distance,
150 kilometres.

636
01:07:37,388 --> 01:07:40,474
But the kid is strong.

637
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:44,729
<i>Dalaikhan and my dad have competed
in all of the festivals.</i>

638
01:07:44,979 --> 01:07:46,230
<i>He's like my uncle.</i>

639
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,358
There are a lot of lessons
to be learnt here.

640
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:54,071
Have you seen Aisholpan's eaglet?

641
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,158
Yes, you seem to think it is ready.

642
01:07:57,324 --> 01:07:59,160
We will see tomorrow.

643
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:02,079
Lots of foxes and other animals.

644
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:03,956
But the land is slippery...

645
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:07,710
...the winter began harshly.

646
01:08:07,877 --> 01:08:12,131
Even guys can't take it as of late.

647
01:08:12,298 --> 01:08:15,217
But the kid has to be alert.

648
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:16,969
Watch out for the kid.

649
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:18,387
Yes, of course.

650
01:08:18,554 --> 01:08:21,849
We will always worry for our children.

651
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:22,933
Yes indeed.

652
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:05,935
<i>I'm really surprised.</i>

653
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:11,106
<i>We didn't think Aisholpan
could eagle-hunt.</i>

654
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:19,156
<i>She is doing what she saw as a child.</i>

655
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:23,327
Are we ready now?

656
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:37,466
Great.

657
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:40,636
In the name of God.

658
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,647
There is a saying in Kazakh:

659
01:09:52,648 --> 01:09:58,696
"What a baby sees in the nest,
it then repeats when it grows up."

660
01:10:20,593 --> 01:10:22,136
Turn here.

661
01:10:23,971 --> 01:10:26,181
<i>Having won the gold cup at the festival...</i>

662
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:30,102
<i>...Aisholpan's journey now takes
a more personal turn.</i>

663
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:35,190
<i>As she heads out into the mountains,
she leaves her public victory behind.</i>

664
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,902
<i>She will now attempt the final step...</i>

665
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:41,697
<i>...on the path to
full eagle hunter status.</i>

666
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:45,200
<i>She will have to be patient.</i>

667
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:48,162
<i>Finding a fox out here can take weeks.</i>

668
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:51,540
Look at this. The whole steppe
is blanketed in snow!

669
01:10:51,707 --> 01:10:56,587
Hunters call this first big snowfall
of the year "Kansonar."

670
01:11:17,816 --> 01:11:21,528
<i>We don't take easy roads
when we go out hunting.</i>

671
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:34,625
<i>There's little comfort
in these bitterly cold conditions.</i>

672
01:11:47,846 --> 01:11:53,727
<i>It's not unheard of for horses to slip
and fall off the side of a cliff.</i>

673
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:56,355
Stay close.

674
01:11:58,941 --> 01:11:59,984
Stay sharp.

675
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:02,319
<i>The stones...</i>

676
01:12:02,695 --> 01:12:04,613
<i>...the cliffs, the snow.</i>

677
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:07,908
<i>It all takes a toll.</i>

678
01:12:13,205 --> 01:12:17,710
<i>The temperature regularly plummets
as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

679
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:21,255
<i>Basically, we freeze.</i>

680
01:12:24,049 --> 01:12:26,051
Let's get these horses
something to drink.

681
01:12:54,997 --> 01:12:57,041
Your horse has quenched his thirst.

682
01:13:03,172 --> 01:13:07,259
It's time to find some fox tracks.

683
01:13:11,764 --> 01:13:15,225
<i>Aisholpan and her father will
venture onto the frozen steppe by day...</i>

684
01:13:15,434 --> 01:13:18,479
<i>...but will return to the village
at night for shelter.</i>

685
01:13:18,687 --> 01:13:21,190
<i>They are determined
to repeat the process...</i>

686
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:24,359
<i>...until she proves herself
a master eagle huntress.</i>

687
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:29,198
Come closer. It's slippery here.

688
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:31,658
Hold on tightly.

689
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:44,213
Check out those paw prints!

690
01:13:44,379 --> 01:13:46,340
Yes, these are fox tracks.

691
01:13:48,217 --> 01:13:49,802
They're still fresh.

692
01:13:50,511 --> 01:13:51,804
Let's find this fox.

693
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,180
Let's go.

694
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,266
My guess is he went to that mountain.

695
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:06,026
Look! More tracks!

696
01:14:26,255 --> 01:14:27,631
There it is!

697
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:32,094
Time to move it!

698
01:14:42,104 --> 01:14:43,897
Where is it? Where'd it go?

699
01:15:01,373 --> 01:15:04,751
Here it is! It's on! You head that way!

700
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:11,800
<i>The eagle hunter finds
the highest place with the best view.</i>

701
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:21,518
<i>The catcher tries to chase the fox...</i>

702
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:24,313
<i>...until it becomes visible
to the eagle hunter.</i>

703
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:38,262
Eagles make mistakes
the first time they hunt.

704
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:43,934
Were you afraid, my dear?

705
01:16:44,601 --> 01:16:48,105
Is it hard hunting
so far away from home?

706
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:51,525
We'll all do better this time.

707
01:16:52,067 --> 01:16:54,194
You shoot up that mountain over there.

708
01:16:59,408 --> 01:17:01,576
<i>The hunter and chaser
work as a team.</i>

709
01:17:02,995 --> 01:17:06,331
<i>Only if they work together
can they hope to be successful.</i>

710
01:17:46,997 --> 01:17:48,832
Don't be disheartened, my child.

711
01:17:50,751 --> 01:17:52,127
First those mountains.
Then this mountain.

712
01:17:52,294 --> 01:17:54,921
It can easily jump from one to another.

713
01:17:56,131 --> 01:17:58,717
The fox is a very sly animal.
Not in a hurry to give up its life.

714
01:17:59,134 --> 01:18:00,927
But your eagle has real talent.

715
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:04,848
She just needs her moment.

716
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:06,892
Let's make for that mountain,
that's the spot.

717
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:12,898
Let's move out.

718
01:18:26,953 --> 01:18:27,954
We should watch our step around here.

719
01:18:28,663 --> 01:18:30,082
That's some heavy snow.

720
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,171
Come on, let's keep going.

721
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:59,111
Turn it around! Turn it around!

722
01:18:59,277 --> 01:19:00,487
Secure your eagle!

723
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:01,696
Hold on tight to your eagle!

724
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:05,117
Just get off your horse
and lead it by the bridle.

725
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:09,830
Stop right there.

726
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:11,540
Get off your horse
and walk the rest of the way.

727
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:26,763
He won't budge!

728
01:19:31,226 --> 01:19:32,102
Then give him a proper yank!

729
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,275
Keep going.

730
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:45,949
Follow in my footsteps.

731
01:22:12,554 --> 01:22:13,638
Ride faster!

732
01:22:32,616 --> 01:22:33,867
We caught it! We caught it!

733
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,620
Okay, my child!

734
01:22:37,203 --> 01:22:38,204
Did you see the catch?

735
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:39,372
Yes.

736
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:44,919
Let go.

737
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:46,212
Let go.

738
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:47,631
Let go.

739
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:50,967
Thank God.
She's caught her first fox.

740
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,848
You released her beautifully.

741
01:22:57,015 --> 01:22:58,058
Thanks.

742
01:22:58,475 --> 01:23:00,977
Did the fox bite your leg?

743
01:23:01,728 --> 01:23:05,190
You did very well for your first time.

744
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:09,194
You're very brave.

745
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:11,071
Your eagle did a great job.

746
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:13,865
First you won the eagle contest.

747
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:16,451
Now you've caught your first fox.

748
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:19,245
To be sure, this is no ordinary bird.

749
01:23:20,455 --> 01:23:22,624
This was a tough endeavour.

750
01:23:26,211 --> 01:23:28,046
We'll tie this fox to your saddle.

751
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:33,426
You get to carry home your first catch...

752
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:36,846
...and Mom can make it into
a warm fur coat for you.

753
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:38,306
Okay!

754
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:46,231
Okay, my child, let's make for home.

755
01:23:46,398 --> 01:23:47,399
Yes.

756
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:00,453
Do you think Mom will be happy?

757
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,539
She'll be thrilled.
And very proud, I'm sure.

758
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,544
Grandpa will be happy, too, right?

759
01:24:07,711 --> 01:24:09,921
Of course he will be!

760
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:15,635
How about you?
Are you happy now?

761
01:24:17,429 --> 01:24:20,265
Yes. I'm truly happy.

762
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:20,945

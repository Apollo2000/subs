2
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:00,010
Don't.

3
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:02,572
- Calm down.
- Fuck you.

4
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:05,848
Calm down.

5
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,608
Fuck you.

6
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:24,092
Looks like his chute didn't open.

7
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:46,523
Single shooter.

8
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:48,724
How do you know?

9
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,715
Please stop doing that.

10
00:04:21,225 --> 00:04:23,420
You're shooting at the wrong people.

11
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,821
How do I know?

12
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:31,895
Because otherwise, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

13
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:43,008
All right.

14
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:45,238
You wanna show me the right ones?

15
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:51,386
Nikolai.

16
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,681
I mean, I'm Nikolai.

17
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,555
What's the last thing
you remember, Nikolai?

18
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:04,763
War. Yeah.

19
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:06,299
I was with the Chechnya.

20
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:09,705
And there was a light.

21
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:13,070
And then I... Then I woke up and I was...

22
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,709
Falling.

23
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:18,707
Yeah, same thing. I was in Baja.

24
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:20,716
And then there was a light.

25
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:22,943
And then <i>chingao.</i>

26
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:33,653
Where are we?

27
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,763
Maybe she knows.

28
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,269
Shit.

29
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:48,739
You wanna lower the weapon?

30
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:53,413
I've never seen this jungle.

31
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:56,108
And I've seen most.

32
00:05:57,387 --> 00:05:59,446
All right, you think this is Asia?

33
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:01,015
Maybe Africa?

34
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:03,489
Too hot for this time of year.

35
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:05,958
And the topography is all wrong.

36
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:08,622
Amazon, maybe.

37
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:11,129
I saw more parachutes.

38
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,695
Which way?

39
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:15,428
Why?

40
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,207
So I can figure out who threw me out
of a fucking airplane.

41
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:34,454
Fuck. Where's he going?

42
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:40,457
All right, let's hit the fucking road.

43
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:51,235
Fuck.

44
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,780
You remember a plane?

45
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:43,652
I woke up in free fall.

46
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,552
You?

47
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,059
Same.

48
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,425
You're IDF?

49
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:52,832
Yeah.

50
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:54,870
Are you in the service?

51
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,201
Not exactly.

52
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:00,299
You motherfucker.

53
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:03,145
Come on, you motherfucker.

54
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:22,023
You with him?

55
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:23,121
No.

56
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:31,304
Then why don't you mind
your own fucking business?

57
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,672
We have bigger problems right now.

58
00:08:35,345 --> 00:08:38,974
Okay, boss. Whatever you say.

59
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:45,379
I will finish what you started.

60
00:08:51,395 --> 00:08:53,625
Strength in numbers, huh?

61
00:08:54,164 --> 00:08:55,529
Something like that.

62
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:56,621
Yeah?

63
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:59,461
Maybe we should get that guy
hanging in the tree?

64
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,967
Help me!

65
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:03,505
Fuck!

66
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:06,974
Help me! Somebody!

67
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,713
Fuck. Help!

68
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:14,239
Hello?

69
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:17,115
I'm trapped in a parachute
in a fucking tree.

70
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,744
Hey, man, why don't you shut the fuck up?

71
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:20,789
Oh. Thank God.

72
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:22,452
I think I can...

73
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:24,627
Stop moving. You're breaking the branch.

74
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:27,363
You have anything
to cut yourself down with?

75
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:29,192
Why would I... No, I don't.

76
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:31,298
Look, if we get rope
from one of the chutes...

77
00:09:31,401 --> 00:09:32,459
Do something.

78
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:40,899
- Help!
- It was taking too long.

79
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:42,805
Help!

80
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,609
Who the hell are you?

81
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:53,153
I'm a doctor.

82
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:55,918
I was on my way to work.

83
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:00,426
Can someone please just tell me, uh,

84
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:05,229
what the fuck is going on here?

85
00:10:34,798 --> 00:10:37,198
Your ass is awesome.

86
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:48,769
Look.

87
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:58,314
Goddamn. Who the hell is this guy?

88
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,862
What the hell is that?

89
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,241
Who would do this?

90
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:33,219
Whoever they are, they take trophies.

91
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:36,248
In my culture

92
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:40,290
the warrior with the greatest
trophies commands the most respect.

93
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:42,392
Whatever.

94
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:46,160
It's a test.

95
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,068
To see how we do under pressure.

96
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:54,070
If this were a test, you'd all be military.

97
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:55,405
Total strangers.

98
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:57,239
Live rounds.

99
00:11:58,048 --> 00:11:59,913
This is something else.

100
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:01,911
Maybe it's ransom.

101
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:06,282
Back in Tijuana, we kidnap you,

102
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,584
put you in an oil drum.

103
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,257
The ransom's not paid,

104
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:14,321
we light you on fire.

105
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:19,027
I hear these stories about
these experiments they run on cons.

106
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:22,502
They stick drugs in your food and
they sit back and watch what happens.

107
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:24,230
Well, it's not drugs.

108
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:26,700
If it was a psychotropic compound,

109
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,505
we'd be feeling the residual side effects.

110
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:32,339
Loss of motor skills, blurry vision.

111
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,979
And if it was a behavioral experiment...
I mean, there...

112
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,520
There'd be a point.

113
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:43,385
What if we are dead?

114
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,091
I was going to be executed in two days.

115
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:53,929
And I was in combat.

116
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:56,997
So was I.

117
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:59,765
This is hell.

118
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:02,907
Last time I looked, you didn't need
a parachute to get there.

119
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,676
It doesn't matter what happened, or why.

120
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:08,973
We're here.

121
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,685
Only question is, how do we get out?

122
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,623
Where you going?

123
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:20,525
To high ground.

124
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,188
We need to stick together.

125
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:27,035
Then you should follow me.

126
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:06,707
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't do that.

127
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:15,879
Yep.

128
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,618
<i>Archaefructus liaoningensis.</i>

129
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:22,783
That is really, really poisonous.

130
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:27,151
Wouldn't take more than one scratch
to cause total paralysis.

131
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:34,460
Thank you. I'll watch for you out here.

132
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:39,435
You made a buddy.

133
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:49,750
Hey.

134
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:52,719
We need to rest.

135
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,788
So rest.

136
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:59,486
You look like you could use it, too.

137
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:03,966
You got a name?

138
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:09,700
Look.

139
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:13,105
I'm sorry.
You want to play scout leader, great.

140
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:15,871
All right? You wanna follow me, fine.

141
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,947
But I'm not doing this.

142
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:20,612
I'm better on my own.

143
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,384
Wanna see something fucked up?

144
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,803
Well, between that and the sun,

145
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:51,937
I'd say we have a real problem.

146
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:53,775
What about the sun?

147
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:57,149
Hasn't moved since we got here.

148
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:06,254
What do you think is really going on?

149
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,731
What do I think?

150
00:16:14,838 --> 00:16:16,430
Spetsnaz.

151
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:18,268
Alpha Group.

152
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:21,434
Los Zetas, cartel enforcer.

153
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:23,846
RUF.

154
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:26,507
It's a death squad from Sierra Leone.

155
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,948
Yakuza, Inagawa-kai.

156
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:32,112
And the FBI's Most Wanted.

157
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:35,316
And him.

158
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,917
They're all heavy-hitters.
He doesn't belong.

159
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,497
Belong to what?

160
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:48,002
I'd say we were chosen.

161
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:55,140
What about you?

162
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:58,237
What about me?

163
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,177
You know the jungle. Know the players.

164
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:10,186
I'm guessing ex-military. Black ops.

165
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,094
Probably a mercenary.

166
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:15,164
You got a problem with that?

167
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:20,733
Not at the moment.

168
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:24,037
Good.

169
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:08,502
Something was dropped here.

170
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:11,407
Same as us.

171
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:15,016
Not the same as us.

172
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:23,792
You said we were chosen.

173
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:28,020
Chosen for what?

174
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,460
Oh, shit.

175
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:07,870
Looking good there, boss.

176
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:16,840
- Look out!
- Down!

177
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:21,681
Shit!

178
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:42,930
Help!

179
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,006
Shit.

180
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,572
Damn it.

181
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:56,118
Damn it.

182
00:21:25,748 --> 00:21:27,739
12 o'clock. 110 meters.

183
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,681
Take him. Take him.

184
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:31,480
I don't have to.

185
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:36,222
Don't have to.

186
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:45,834
We triggered a dead man's trap.

187
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:53,101
It's two weeks, judging from
the rate of decomposition.

188
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:55,733
He took up a position here.

189
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:01,882
Shooting in all directions.

190
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:04,577
This was a last stand.

191
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:14,455
United States Special Forces.

192
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:16,696
This is strange.

193
00:22:16,966 --> 00:22:20,766
He is supposed to be deployed
in Afghanistan.

194
00:22:21,337 --> 00:22:23,567
What's he doing here, setting traps for us?

195
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,965
They weren't meant for us.

196
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:29,269
He was hunting something else.

197
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:31,169
Something a lot bigger.

198
00:22:31,514 --> 00:22:33,038
Bigger?

199
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:36,048
The trunk was a dead-fall.

200
00:22:36,152 --> 00:22:37,585
Rule of thumb with a dead-fall

201
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:40,656
is you set the weight
five times that of the target animal.

202
00:22:41,624 --> 00:22:44,115
Whatever it was,
it got through the trip wires.

203
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:45,922
And it did this.

204
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:53,062
Let's move.

205
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,016
What is it?

206
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:19,456
What is it?

207
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,531
Nothing.

208
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:44,512
What is it? Nothing. Nothing.

209
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:46,121
Nothing.

210
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:58,356
We're gonna need a new plan.

211
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:19,809
Where are we going?

212
00:25:19,915 --> 00:25:22,213
Someone put us on this rock.

213
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:24,684
There's got to be a way off it.

214
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:27,882
What the fuck?

215
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:35,395
You know what? Fuck this.

216
00:25:35,498 --> 00:25:37,159
This is bullshit, man.

217
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:38,790
I want a gun.

218
00:25:39,268 --> 00:25:41,498
Come on, man,
you got two motherfucking guns, man.

219
00:25:41,604 --> 00:25:43,299
Somebody give me a gun.

220
00:25:43,973 --> 00:25:48,069
Come on, Russian.
You got a big fucking gun.

221
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:53,415
Come on, man.

222
00:25:53,983 --> 00:25:55,883
Give me a gun.

223
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:58,912
Give me your gun. Right now.

224
00:26:00,656 --> 00:26:02,248
Give me your gun.

225
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:10,991
I'm ready to die.

226
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,326
Are you?

227
00:27:27,676 --> 00:27:28,768
Oh.

228
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:36,377
Help!

229
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,149
Oh, shit!

230
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:47,857
Oh, shit!

231
00:27:49,265 --> 00:27:50,323
Oh.

232
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:52,359
Shit! Fuck!

233
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:12,254
Help!

234
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:18,087
Fuck you! Fuck you!

235
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,533
Looking good there, boss.

236
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,881
Go! Go!

237
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:44,782
Come on. Come on.

238
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:55,662
Oh, shit!

239
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:05,703
Come on!

240
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:09,866
No!

241
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,169
As bad as you are,

242
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:46,638
those things are worse.

243
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:08,030
So they... They just, what, left?

244
00:30:09,304 --> 00:30:10,328
No.

245
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,170
The whistle.

246
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,402
They were called.

247
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:16,805
All right, listen up.

248
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:19,107
Everybody do a shell count.

249
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:21,648
We got to conserve ammunition.

250
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,548
Reload. Do it now.

251
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:28,648
Excuse me.
Just what the hell is going on here?

252
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:31,459
We're being hunted.

253
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:38,360
The cages. The soldier. All of us.

254
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:42,563
All brought here for the same purpose.

255
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,974
This planet is a game preserve.

256
00:30:48,277 --> 00:30:49,539
And we're the game.

257
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:55,612
In case you didn't notice,

258
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:58,380
we just got flushed out.

259
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:01,989
They sent the dogs in,

260
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:06,084
just like you would if you
were stalking boar or shooting quail.

261
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:10,788
They split us apart and they watched.
Testing us.

262
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:19,267
How do you know this?

263
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:21,932
Because

264
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:24,508
that's what I would do.

265
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:28,542
Fantastic.

266
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:30,612
Wait.

267
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:34,344
There are only seven of us.

268
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:37,515
Help me!

269
00:31:47,636 --> 00:31:49,126
Help!

270
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:17,459
Help.

271
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:22,899
- Wait.
- What?

272
00:32:24,306 --> 00:32:26,103
It's a trap.

273
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:38,317
Help me.

274
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:54,029
Fuck me.

275
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:57,431
Help.

276
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,877
Wound one man.

277
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,308
Make him suffer.

278
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,582
Make him bleed.

279
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:15,319
Make him call out for help,

280
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:19,155
and set a trap and kill those who come.

281
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:25,527
I know because I have done this.

282
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:30,329
So we're gonna leave him here, right?

283
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,071
Come on, look at him. He's done.

284
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,236
There's nothing else we can do, right?

285
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:40,815
Right?

286
00:33:48,557 --> 00:33:49,717
We leave him.

287
00:33:51,226 --> 00:33:52,818
I can't.

288
00:33:53,862 --> 00:33:55,830
Then, that's on you.

289
00:34:12,281 --> 00:34:15,341
Help me.

290
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,768
Help me.

291
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:53,978
Help me. Help me.

292
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:56,421
It's a trap. It's a trap. It's a trap.

293
00:35:17,879 --> 00:35:19,574
What are we gonna do?

294
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:23,214
We should go to higher ground.

295
00:35:23,318 --> 00:35:24,649
Really?

296
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,988
We're trapped on an alien hunting planet.

297
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:30,183
You really think the solution
is to walk more?

298
00:35:34,563 --> 00:35:36,531
It wants us to run.

299
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:40,535
That's how it hunts.

300
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:46,331
This is its jungle.

301
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:49,173
Its game.

302
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:52,242
Its rules.

303
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,217
We run,

304
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,186
we die.

305
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,257
What's the alternative?

306
00:36:04,526 --> 00:36:07,154
We need to know who we're dealing with.

307
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:10,824
Dog tracks go that way.

308
00:36:13,402 --> 00:36:15,370
We go after it.

309
00:36:33,822 --> 00:36:35,016
Well?

310
00:36:35,924 --> 00:36:37,949
No movement.

311
00:37:14,129 --> 00:37:17,326
It looks like we're not
the only things being hunted.

312
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:44,473
Holy shit!

313
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,842
What the fuck?

314
00:39:46,948 --> 00:39:48,575
What the fuck is that thing?

315
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:52,618
This is a mistake. We have to leave. Now.

316
00:39:53,888 --> 00:39:55,412
Where is the tough guy?

317
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:01,789
He left us.

318
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:05,057
He's here.

319
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:25,051
Run!

320
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,994
Run! Run! Run!

321
00:42:59,908 --> 00:43:02,001
You set us up.

322
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:06,011
He led us into that death camp,

323
00:43:06,114 --> 00:43:08,639
then hid
and waited for that thing to strike.

324
00:43:09,551 --> 00:43:11,178
We were bait.

325
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:15,349
I needed to know who we were up against.

326
00:43:16,558 --> 00:43:17,684
Now I do.

327
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:20,022
A man is dead because of that.

328
00:43:21,463 --> 00:43:23,522
This morning you were ready to kill him.

329
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:26,191
It ain't this goddamn morning, is it?

330
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:28,098
At least he didn't die in vain.

331
00:43:28,203 --> 00:43:30,330
Why? So we could find out firsthand

332
00:43:30,438 --> 00:43:32,906
what it feels like to have our asses kicked?

333
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:35,601
No. We found out
that there's more than one of them.

334
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,577
That they use projectile
and energy-based weapons.

335
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,773
That they have
some sort of cloaking device.

336
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:42,713
That they're bigger than us,

337
00:43:42,817 --> 00:43:45,547
stronger, but also heavier.

338
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:50,550
You put us at risk for yourself.

339
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:53,194
You want to be on your own,

340
00:43:54,095 --> 00:43:55,062
you got it.

341
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,220
Why don't you tell them the truth?

342
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,033
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know what I'm talking about.

343
00:44:00,134 --> 00:44:04,264
The way you looked at that thing that
was strung up, the way you reacted.

344
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,971
She knows what it is. Don't you?

345
00:44:28,563 --> 00:44:30,155
We don't have a name for them.

346
00:44:35,336 --> 00:44:37,668
'87, Guatemala.

347
00:44:40,008 --> 00:44:43,171
A spec ops team went into the jungle.

348
00:44:43,278 --> 00:44:44,768
High end.

349
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:47,643
Six men plus a CIA liaison.

350
00:44:48,449 --> 00:44:50,383
Only one made it out.

351
00:44:51,185 --> 00:44:53,278
In his debrief,

352
00:44:53,388 --> 00:44:56,323
he said they came in contact
with something.

353
00:44:56,424 --> 00:44:58,892
He gave a detailed description.

354
00:45:01,195 --> 00:45:02,560
The thing on the totem.

355
00:45:05,433 --> 00:45:09,529
It wore some kind of camouflage
that adjusted to ambient light.

356
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:12,504
Made it nearly invisible in our spectrum.

357
00:45:13,308 --> 00:45:16,004
It could see in infrared.

358
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:18,203
Heat signatures.

359
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:21,443
He used mud to block his.

360
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:23,676
That's how he beat it.

361
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:29,386
It hunted and killed his team,

362
00:45:32,894 --> 00:45:34,452
one by one.

363
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:39,028
Whatever it is,

364
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:42,232
wherever they're from,

365
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:46,267
we're going to kill them all.

366
00:45:47,308 --> 00:45:49,799
We set up a defensive perimeter.

367
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:52,175
Make it look like we are holing up.

368
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,077
That'll bring them to us.

369
00:45:54,582 --> 00:45:56,675
We force them into a choke point.

370
00:45:56,784 --> 00:45:59,617
We get them in overlapping fields of fire.

371
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:01,954
It can be done.

372
00:46:04,225 --> 00:46:06,523
I can't do it alone.

373
00:46:41,863 --> 00:46:44,832
You know, man, if we ever make it home,

374
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:48,326
I'm gonna do so much fucking cocaine.

375
00:46:49,671 --> 00:46:52,003
I'm gonna rape so many fine bitches.

376
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:56,132
I'll be like, "What time is it? 5:00?

377
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:58,334
"Damn.

378
00:46:58,446 --> 00:47:01,244
"Time to go rape me some fine bitches."

379
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:02,611
You know what I'm saying?

380
00:47:02,817 --> 00:47:05,012
Oh, yeah. Totally.

381
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,747
Like, 5:00,

382
00:47:08,956 --> 00:47:10,651
it's bitch-raping time.

383
00:47:11,092 --> 00:47:12,116
Mmm.

384
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,486
Yeah.

385
00:47:22,603 --> 00:47:25,128
- You should stay away from him.
- Yeah.

386
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:38,045
You still pissed?

387
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,619
Fuck you.

388
00:47:53,901 --> 00:47:56,301
You know what the difference between
you and me is?

389
00:47:57,872 --> 00:48:00,363
We both do the same thing.

390
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:02,073
You just do it for a country,

391
00:48:02,176 --> 00:48:04,542
so you don't have to admit you like it.

392
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,540
What happened to you?

393
00:48:08,649 --> 00:48:10,776
What made you so fucked up?

394
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:18,117
"There is no hunting
like the hunting of a man.

395
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,551
"And those who've hunted armed men
long enough,

396
00:48:22,063 --> 00:48:24,156
"and like it,

397
00:48:24,265 --> 00:48:27,291
"never really care
for anything else thereafter."

398
00:48:30,338 --> 00:48:32,306
That's pretty poetic.

399
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:36,672
Did you come up with that all by yourself?

400
00:48:36,778 --> 00:48:38,746
No, actually.

401
00:48:40,047 --> 00:48:42,311
That was Hemingway.

402
00:49:20,488 --> 00:49:21,455
Fuck.

403
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:25,890
Why isn't it coming?

404
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,298
They see our traps.

405
00:49:48,649 --> 00:49:50,014
Hey, Doc.

406
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:51,709
Hey.

407
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:55,220
I think I just figured out
a way you can be useful.

408
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:06,790
Shit. Shit.

409
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:10,563
I hate this. I hate this. I hate this.

410
00:50:10,671 --> 00:50:11,899
Oh!

411
00:50:17,011 --> 00:50:18,842
Come on. Come on. Come on.

412
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:22,410
Oh, shit!

413
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:23,608
Come on. Come on.

414
00:50:23,718 --> 00:50:25,413
Fucking shoot!

415
00:50:26,954 --> 00:50:28,114
Shoot already!

416
00:50:38,966 --> 00:50:40,627
Fuck

417
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:43,837
all of you!

418
00:50:52,546 --> 00:50:56,482
Is he dead? Why ain't you smiling? Oh, shit.

419
00:50:57,218 --> 00:50:58,981
The thing from the cages.

420
00:50:59,086 --> 00:51:01,884
Maybe it thought we're the ones
who dropped it here.

421
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:08,859
Good shot, though.

422
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:13,291
I missed.

423
00:51:21,242 --> 00:51:23,540
Over here.

424
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:29,413
Over here.

425
00:51:37,525 --> 00:51:38,719
Over here.

426
00:51:44,732 --> 00:51:46,723
Turn around.

427
00:51:57,745 --> 00:52:00,509
What the fuck are you?

428
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:13,517
I'm alive.

429
00:52:21,335 --> 00:52:22,927
You talk too loud.

430
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:32,640
Smelled you since you got here.

431
00:52:34,949 --> 00:52:37,144
If I can smell you,

432
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:39,412
if I can hear you,

433
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:41,988
they can, too.

434
00:52:47,094 --> 00:52:49,995
Storm coming soon. This way.

435
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:52,622
Wait.

436
00:52:55,102 --> 00:52:56,933
Who are you?

437
00:52:59,106 --> 00:53:01,506
Noland,

438
00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:04,009
run away,

439
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:07,137
live to fight another day.

440
00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:13,683
I'm the one that got away.

441
00:53:15,723 --> 00:53:17,953
The one you don't fuck with.

442
00:54:46,413 --> 00:54:47,846
Come on.

443
00:54:47,948 --> 00:54:50,416
Feel the vibe of this place.

444
00:55:05,266 --> 00:55:06,494
Where are we?

445
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,569
It's a drill somebody left behind.

446
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:14,164
The machine is dead,
but the power source ain't.

447
00:56:17,805 --> 00:56:19,568
Wow, what a shit-hole.

448
00:56:19,673 --> 00:56:20,867
You live here?

449
00:56:20,975 --> 00:56:25,776
Oh, no. No. This is my summer home.

450
00:56:25,879 --> 00:56:31,249
I winter in the Riviera.
The schools are so much nicer there.

451
00:56:31,352 --> 00:56:32,512
And the men...

452
00:56:33,153 --> 00:56:34,518
Ooh, la, la!

453
00:56:36,056 --> 00:56:38,524
By the way, you're welcome.

454
00:56:39,226 --> 00:56:41,524
How have you survived?

455
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:50,429
Salvaging what I can, when I can,

456
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:53,506
from whatever I can.

457
00:56:55,476 --> 00:56:56,568
Oh.

458
00:56:58,145 --> 00:57:00,613
Noland, Ronald.

459
00:57:00,714 --> 00:57:03,114
Air Cav.

460
00:57:03,217 --> 00:57:05,117
They...

461
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:06,948
They drop you all in, too?

462
00:57:07,888 --> 00:57:09,788
Yeah.

463
00:57:10,024 --> 00:57:12,049
Hmm.

464
00:57:12,826 --> 00:57:14,555
What a rush.

465
00:57:22,703 --> 00:57:24,330
Hey.

466
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:26,133
Yeah, I'll tell him.

467
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,870
Hey, Agent Orange,
you wanna put that down?

468
00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:32,104
Certain people around here

469
00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:34,544
are particular about other people
messing with their shit.

470
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:37,642
Very important, though.

471
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:41,152
Disrupts the heat signature.

472
00:57:41,255 --> 00:57:42,984
You motherfuckers.

473
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:47,559
So, you killed one?

474
00:57:48,395 --> 00:57:49,384
Uh-uh.

475
00:57:49,496 --> 00:57:51,521
I killed two.

476
00:57:52,966 --> 00:57:54,365
Maybe three.

477
00:57:55,169 --> 00:57:57,694
I can't remember. Anyway,

478
00:57:59,673 --> 00:58:02,369
there's two different types of them
out there.

479
00:58:02,476 --> 00:58:05,036
Hmm? Now they're similar,
but they're different.

480
00:58:05,145 --> 00:58:07,943
It's kind of like the difference
between dogs and wolves.

481
00:58:08,449 --> 00:58:11,316
The ones that are running things up there,

482
00:58:11,418 --> 00:58:14,148
the larger ones, hunt the smaller ones.

483
00:58:14,254 --> 00:58:17,189
It's some kind of blood feud, I guess.

484
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:19,623
Been going on for a long time.

485
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:23,654
They do this just for sport?

486
00:58:23,764 --> 00:58:27,757
Oh, yeah, they bring in fresh meat
season after season.

487
00:58:27,868 --> 00:58:30,336
I mean, shit you wouldn't believe.

488
00:58:31,338 --> 00:58:32,999
Bring it in,

489
00:58:33,107 --> 00:58:37,373
and hunt it and kill it. In that order.

490
00:58:39,513 --> 00:58:41,640
How long you been here, man?

491
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:44,108
Uh...

492
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:48,279
Seven seasons, I think.

493
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:51,348
What? Ten?

494
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:53,290
Damn.

495
00:58:53,394 --> 00:58:57,296
Anyway, every once in a while,
one of us kills one of them.

496
00:58:58,232 --> 00:59:01,895
And, let me tell you,
that's when they get real interested.

497
00:59:02,002 --> 00:59:06,098
See, they learn quick. They adapt.

498
00:59:07,641 --> 00:59:10,109
They develop a whole new set of skills.

499
00:59:10,244 --> 00:59:14,977
They come back the next season
in threes, always in threes.

500
00:59:15,082 --> 00:59:17,107
Their armor might've changed,

501
00:59:17,217 --> 00:59:19,947
or their weapons have changed,

502
00:59:20,053 --> 00:59:22,317
or their tactics have changed.

503
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,317
It's amazing.

504
00:59:25,926 --> 00:59:27,860
So, it's like evolution.

505
00:59:29,096 --> 00:59:32,725
They're trying to make themselves
into better killers.

506
00:59:33,267 --> 00:59:34,495
Mmm-hmm.

507
00:59:35,536 --> 00:59:37,868
You said they come back.

508
00:59:40,073 --> 00:59:41,233
How?

509
00:59:41,575 --> 00:59:43,304
They got a ship.

510
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,940
- A ship?
- Yeah.

511
00:59:46,046 --> 00:59:48,276
It's 30 yards from their camp.

512
00:59:51,118 --> 00:59:53,018
I told you they wouldn't see it.

513
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,047
I told you they wouldn't.

514
00:59:55,155 --> 00:59:56,247
You were there.

515
00:59:59,526 --> 01:00:01,494
You could've helped us.

516
01:00:04,865 --> 01:00:06,890
How do we kill them?

517
01:00:09,102 --> 01:00:11,036
However you can.

518
01:00:12,873 --> 01:00:14,204
They must have a weakness.

519
01:00:16,443 --> 01:00:17,740
Not many.

520
01:00:18,812 --> 01:00:23,772
You want to survive?
You dig in deep. You stay hid.

521
01:00:24,418 --> 01:00:26,886
Yeah, well, we're gonna go
with door number two.

522
01:00:26,987 --> 01:00:28,887
How do we get out of this valley?

523
01:00:29,189 --> 01:00:30,417
Oh.

524
01:00:31,225 --> 01:00:32,715
Ten seasons.

525
01:00:33,727 --> 01:00:36,059
First two seasons...
No, three seasons I was here,

526
01:00:36,163 --> 01:00:38,825
I was walking in the same direction,

527
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:42,197
trying to reach the edge of the preserve.

528
01:00:47,474 --> 01:00:51,137
Let me tell you something,
there ain't no edge of the preserve.

529
01:00:54,047 --> 01:00:57,175
Maybe you and your friend
wanna tell me about that ship?

530
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,112
Let's see.

531
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:06,520
That's a brilliant idea. Brilliant.

532
01:01:08,228 --> 01:01:11,857
The whole time I've been here,
it never occurred to me

533
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:13,956
to commandeer the alien spacecraft.

534
01:01:15,502 --> 01:01:18,266
But I wouldn't know how to fly it.

535
01:01:19,673 --> 01:01:21,197
He would.

536
01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:23,540
Of course, you know how to fly.

537
01:01:24,077 --> 01:01:25,840
I'll give it a shot.

538
01:01:29,483 --> 01:01:30,973
Well...

539
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:34,651
I'm gonna get some sleep.

540
01:01:35,522 --> 01:01:38,218
No noise. They're out there.

541
01:01:39,259 --> 01:01:41,227
They're always out there.

542
01:01:44,031 --> 01:01:45,828
Water in there.

543
01:01:47,568 --> 01:01:51,060
Help yourself. All of you.

544
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:15,918
Who's that?

545
01:02:17,197 --> 01:02:18,892
My kids.

546
01:02:21,368 --> 01:02:24,860
Big one, Ilya. And that's Sascha.

547
01:02:31,445 --> 01:02:32,537
Uh...

548
01:02:34,715 --> 01:02:37,741
This is, uh, Candy Lee.

549
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:41,378
Tits like howitzers.

550
01:02:43,991 --> 01:02:45,515
Is that your girlfriend?

551
01:02:47,327 --> 01:02:49,261
No. It's my sister.

552
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:10,513
This is old.

553
01:03:10,617 --> 01:03:12,710
Very old.

554
01:03:12,819 --> 01:03:15,754
They've been doing this for a long time.

555
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,191
You speak English.

556
01:03:19,393 --> 01:03:20,860
Yes.

557
01:03:21,862 --> 01:03:24,023
Why don't you say more?

558
01:03:29,469 --> 01:03:31,528
Because I talk too much.

559
01:03:56,353 --> 01:03:57,752
Thanks.

560
01:04:09,967 --> 01:04:12,765
Do you know what I was doing
when I was taken?

561
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:19,297
Isaac, my spotter.

562
01:04:20,211 --> 01:04:21,872
He was caught.

563
01:04:23,214 --> 01:04:24,238
I could have done something,

564
01:04:24,348 --> 01:04:26,441
but then I would have been slaughtered
along with him.

565
01:04:27,818 --> 01:04:29,513
So, I hid.

566
01:04:30,988 --> 01:04:32,956
I watched him die.

567
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:40,790
I wish I pulled that trigger.

568
01:04:40,898 --> 01:04:43,366
You do what you have to, to survive.

569
01:04:44,568 --> 01:04:46,900
You said we were chosen.

570
01:04:48,606 --> 01:04:50,506
I asked, "For what?"

571
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:55,168
I should've asked why.

572
01:04:55,746 --> 01:04:58,306
It's because we are predators.

573
01:05:00,251 --> 01:05:01,377
Just like them.

574
01:05:03,053 --> 01:05:05,715
We're the monsters of our own world.

575
01:05:07,658 --> 01:05:10,559
It's probably better
that we're never going back.

576
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:12,390
I am going back.

577
01:05:17,635 --> 01:05:19,398
I'm going after that ship.

578
01:05:21,305 --> 01:05:24,604
You learn how to fly it
in the last hour and not tell me?

579
01:05:25,075 --> 01:05:26,372
No.

580
01:05:27,244 --> 01:05:30,042
That thing strung up at the camp
might know.

581
01:05:30,748 --> 01:05:34,240
My guess is, it'd do
just about anything to get free.

582
01:05:35,919 --> 01:05:38,285
Enemy of my enemy.

583
01:05:38,756 --> 01:05:41,122
That doesn't make it a friend.

584
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:48,655
So what do I call you?

585
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:57,340
Smoke.

586
01:05:57,775 --> 01:05:59,402
Hey, smoke.

587
01:06:00,744 --> 01:06:01,733
Fuck.

588
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:09,276
Where's Noland?

589
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:14,020
He's a scavenger.

590
01:06:14,124 --> 01:06:15,614
He wants what we have.

591
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:28,167
Come on!
There must be a way out!

592
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:32,403
- Damn it.
- Do it!

593
01:06:32,509 --> 01:06:34,340
You see the shit
you've gotten us into, man?

594
01:06:35,379 --> 01:06:37,108
I told you that.
You never listen to me, though.

595
01:06:37,548 --> 01:06:39,539
Six more.
Six more fucking mouths to feed.

596
01:06:40,351 --> 01:06:41,875
I can barely stand living with you.

597
01:06:43,187 --> 01:06:44,484
How am I gonna live with them, too?

598
01:06:46,156 --> 01:06:47,384
Damn it!

599
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:48,880
What?

600
01:06:49,193 --> 01:06:50,990
Say goodbye to your little friend.

601
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:56,024
You're in my house, motherfucker!

602
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:00,960
Get down.

603
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:08,841
Yeah, that didn't open up shit.

604
01:07:09,413 --> 01:07:12,109
Wasn't meant to, asshole.

605
01:07:12,216 --> 01:07:14,207
I'm calling in the cavalry.

606
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,225
How the fuck
can we get out of here?

607
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:28,793
Open up, you hanky fucker.

608
01:07:50,254 --> 01:07:51,744
Come on!

609
01:07:57,227 --> 01:07:58,387
Oh.

610
01:07:58,495 --> 01:08:00,895
Finally found me, huh, big dog?

611
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:05,034
Well, what took you so long?

612
01:08:09,406 --> 01:08:11,067
It's not gonna open!

613
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:15,205
God damn it!

614
01:08:46,543 --> 01:08:47,942
It's toying with us.

615
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:30,302
Guys?

616
01:10:31,248 --> 01:10:32,510
Oh, shit.

617
01:10:45,862 --> 01:10:47,659
Hey!

618
01:11:35,178 --> 01:11:36,907
This way.

619
01:11:40,484 --> 01:11:41,473
Hey!

620
01:11:43,553 --> 01:11:44,520
Hey!

621
01:11:46,523 --> 01:11:48,548
I lost you guys!

622
01:11:52,362 --> 01:11:54,057
You got to get me out of here, man.

623
01:11:54,364 --> 01:11:56,559
Come on. Come on.

624
01:11:58,001 --> 01:11:59,025
Let's move.

625
01:12:27,431 --> 01:12:28,796
Oh...

626
01:13:18,815 --> 01:13:20,214
Oh!

627
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,077
We killed it.

628
01:14:29,452 --> 01:14:30,885
We killed it.

629
01:14:32,088 --> 01:14:34,249
We killed it! We fucking...

630
01:14:36,092 --> 01:14:38,117
We fucking killed it.

631
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:40,128
We killed it.

632
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:42,323
We fucking killed it. Huh?

633
01:14:42,432 --> 01:14:44,900
Who's your daddy now, motherfucker?

634
01:14:45,001 --> 01:14:46,662
Who's your daddy now, motherfucker?

635
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,169
Hunt my dick, bitch!

636
01:15:04,821 --> 01:15:06,652
Die, you space faggot!

637
01:15:06,756 --> 01:15:09,657
Who do you think you're dealing with,
Hoss? Is that all you've got?

638
01:15:09,759 --> 01:15:11,852
Go! Go!

639
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:25,173
Come on.

640
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:26,264
Come on!

641
01:15:26,476 --> 01:15:27,807
Come on!

642
01:16:02,712 --> 01:16:04,577
Let's get to that ship.

643
01:19:27,951 --> 01:19:30,681
We're close. Come on.

644
01:19:32,255 --> 01:19:33,984
Ow! Shit!

645
01:19:36,025 --> 01:19:37,049
Shit.

646
01:19:42,532 --> 01:19:43,829
Fuck!

647
01:19:49,572 --> 01:19:52,541
Another inch,
it would've hit my tibial artery.

648
01:19:52,642 --> 01:19:54,303
I guess this is my lucky day.

649
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:57,470
It isn't. That trap wasn't meant to kill.

650
01:19:58,481 --> 01:19:59,846
It was meant to maim.

651
01:20:01,084 --> 01:20:02,517
He's dead weight. Come on.

652
01:20:02,619 --> 01:20:03,881
Uh, um...

653
01:20:04,787 --> 01:20:07,881
No, I can still walk.

654
01:20:07,991 --> 01:20:10,687
Oh! Shit. God.

655
01:20:10,793 --> 01:20:12,454
No, he can't. Look.

656
01:20:12,562 --> 01:20:14,393
He's done.

657
01:20:14,497 --> 01:20:16,226
You're gonna beg us to slow down.

658
01:20:16,332 --> 01:20:18,892
- No, no, no.
- To carry you.

659
01:20:21,571 --> 01:20:23,664
You can't leave me here.

660
01:20:23,773 --> 01:20:26,469
You can't. I have a family.

661
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:29,544
I got kids.

662
01:20:30,613 --> 01:20:31,637
I'm sorry.

663
01:20:34,484 --> 01:20:36,145
We need to go.

664
01:20:36,252 --> 01:20:37,583
No. No!

665
01:20:37,687 --> 01:20:39,712
You are taking me with you!

666
01:20:39,822 --> 01:20:41,084
Look, you and I can still make it.

667
01:20:41,424 --> 01:20:43,119
We use him.

668
01:20:43,226 --> 01:20:44,693
We booby-trap him.

669
01:20:46,095 --> 01:20:47,084
No.

670
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:49,694
They'll go to him to take trophies.

671
01:20:49,799 --> 01:20:51,733
This is our last chance.

672
01:20:51,834 --> 01:20:53,859
This isn't right. He's one of us!

673
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:54,937
He is.

674
01:20:55,038 --> 01:20:56,699
That's what they're counting on.

675
01:20:56,806 --> 01:20:59,297
They want you
to feel something for this man.

676
01:20:59,409 --> 01:21:01,001
To be human.

677
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:03,638
And what are you?

678
01:21:04,814 --> 01:21:05,940
Alive.

679
01:21:08,651 --> 01:21:10,209
What's that worth?

680
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,254
You can't. Please.

681
01:21:12,355 --> 01:21:14,084
Please, I'm begging you.

682
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:15,851
Please.

683
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:17,017
You should go.

684
01:21:24,867 --> 01:21:26,266
Shit.

685
01:21:32,508 --> 01:21:34,476
- You should've gone with him.
- I know.

686
01:22:01,971 --> 01:22:02,960
Hey.

687
01:22:28,398 --> 01:22:30,832
I want off this planet.

688
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:35,497
You understand me?

689
01:22:37,907 --> 01:22:40,171
I'll cut you down.

690
01:22:41,511 --> 01:22:43,172
You take me to the ship.

691
01:22:44,113 --> 01:22:45,512
Ship.

692
01:22:48,751 --> 01:22:51,083
You understand me, don't you?

693
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:55,448
Huh?

694
01:23:29,392 --> 01:23:30,689
I'm sorry.

695
01:23:30,793 --> 01:23:32,385
We're not dead yet.

696
01:23:35,331 --> 01:23:36,593
Shit.

697
01:27:21,424 --> 01:27:22,789
I guess he made it.

698
01:27:37,173 --> 01:27:39,539
If you could do it over again,

699
01:27:41,077 --> 01:27:43,477
would you make the same choice?

700
01:27:47,283 --> 01:27:48,443
Yes.

701
01:28:02,665 --> 01:28:04,132
Thank you.

702
01:28:06,435 --> 01:28:08,562
When the time comes,

703
01:28:09,805 --> 01:28:11,466
I'll do us both.

704
01:28:12,975 --> 01:28:15,034
I promise it'll be quick.

705
01:28:16,412 --> 01:28:17,379
No.

706
01:28:19,815 --> 01:28:22,113
It won't.

707
01:28:37,867 --> 01:28:39,095
Cool.

708
01:28:41,437 --> 01:28:43,132
That's right.

709
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,506
It's a neurotoxin.

710
01:28:47,109 --> 01:28:48,974
There's so many to choose from
around here.

711
01:28:49,545 --> 01:28:51,843
But don't worry. It's not fatal.

712
01:28:52,348 --> 01:28:55,613
You'll be able to experience everything.

713
01:29:29,285 --> 01:29:32,186
I guess now you realize
why they chose me.

714
01:29:33,789 --> 01:29:36,656
I was right in front of you guys
the whole time.

715
01:29:36,959 --> 01:29:38,984
Just watching you.

716
01:29:40,162 --> 01:29:42,130
Earning your trust.

717
01:29:46,035 --> 01:29:48,765
You couldn't see me for what I really am.

718
01:29:50,172 --> 01:29:52,163
You see, back home,

719
01:29:52,274 --> 01:29:54,174
I'm a murderer.

720
01:29:56,746 --> 01:29:58,111
I'm a freak.

721
01:29:59,582 --> 01:30:00,742
But here,

722
01:30:02,051 --> 01:30:03,780
among the monsters,

723
01:30:07,723 --> 01:30:09,782
I'm normal.

724
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:12,623
I like it here.

725
01:30:13,496 --> 01:30:15,054
I wanna stay.

726
01:30:36,752 --> 01:30:38,845
Oh! You came back.

727
01:30:39,755 --> 01:30:41,814
I missed my ride.

728
01:30:42,658 --> 01:30:44,455
Oh, thank God.

729
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,959
Help us get out of here.

730
01:31:06,549 --> 01:31:08,141
She's paralyzed.

731
01:31:09,451 --> 01:31:11,783
It gave her something. I don't know what,

732
01:31:11,887 --> 01:31:14,082
but it paralyzed her.

733
01:31:17,993 --> 01:31:19,358
Come on.

734
01:31:37,847 --> 01:31:40,873
You're so busy taking care of others,

735
01:31:40,983 --> 01:31:42,746
you forgot to look out for yourself.

736
01:31:44,653 --> 01:31:46,211
We're getting out of here.

737
01:31:46,322 --> 01:31:48,381
You just hang tight, okay?

738
01:31:48,924 --> 01:31:50,653
I didn't think you'd come back.

739
01:31:52,461 --> 01:31:54,326
But she,

740
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:56,660
she never lost faith in you.

741
01:31:57,633 --> 01:31:59,430
I guess I owe you an apology.

742
01:32:01,937 --> 01:32:04,064
You are a good man after all.

743
01:32:05,774 --> 01:32:06,900
No.

744
01:32:07,743 --> 01:32:08,937
I'm not.

745
01:32:13,582 --> 01:32:15,106
But I'm fast.

746
01:32:30,699 --> 01:32:31,996
Come here.

747
01:32:37,206 --> 01:32:40,471
Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me.

748
01:32:41,043 --> 01:32:42,340
I won't.

749
01:33:57,486 --> 01:33:58,953
Help me.

750
01:34:01,023 --> 01:34:01,657
I'm one of you.

751
01:34:01,657 --> 01:34:02,282
I'm one of you.

752
01:34:34,757 --> 01:34:35,815
Yes.

753
01:34:35,924 --> 01:34:38,188
Come on. Come on.

754
01:34:39,228 --> 01:34:41,924
Come on. Come on. Do it.

755
01:34:42,698 --> 01:34:44,131
I'm here. Kill me.

756
01:34:44,833 --> 01:34:46,164
Come on.

757
01:34:46,602 --> 01:34:48,001
Come on.

758
01:34:48,103 --> 01:34:49,570
Do it now. Kill me!

759
01:36:00,843 --> 01:36:01,832
Oh, shit.

760
01:38:55,117 --> 01:38:57,210
Did you get it?

761
01:38:58,053 --> 01:38:59,350
Yeah.

762
01:39:12,467 --> 01:39:14,094
I'm Royce.

763
01:39:17,139 --> 01:39:19,300
Nice to meet you, Royce.

764
01:39:21,677 --> 01:39:23,304
I'm ISABELLE.

765
01:40:50,098 --> 01:40:51,395
Now,

766
01:40:52,501 --> 01:40:55,629
let's find a way off this fucking planet.

767
01:41:19,127 --> 01:41:20,685
<i>Don't tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John</i>

768
01:41:20,796 --> 01:41:23,094
<i>He claims he has the music</i>
<i>But he has a lot of fun</i>

769
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:27,066
<i>Oh, baby, yeah, baby</i>

770
01:41:27,169 --> 01:41:32,835
<i>Ooh, baby, having me</i>
<i>some fun tonight, yeah</i>

771
01:41:32,941 --> 01:41:35,569
<i>Well, long, tall Sally</i>
<i>She's built sweet</i>

772
01:41:35,677 --> 01:41:38,237
<i>She's got everything that Uncle John needs</i>

773
01:41:38,346 --> 01:41:42,248
<i>Oh, baby, yeah, baby</i>

774
01:41:42,350 --> 01:41:48,050
<i>Ooh, baby, having me</i>
<i>some fun tonight, yeah</i>

775
01:41:48,156 --> 01:41:51,057
<i>Well, I saw Uncle John with bald-head Sally</i>

776
01:41:51,159 --> 01:41:53,457
<i>He saw Aunt Mary coming and</i>
<i>he ducked back in the alley</i>

777
01:41:53,562 --> 01:41:57,464
<i>Oh, baby, yeah, baby</i>

778
01:41:57,566 --> 01:42:02,936
<i>Oh, baby, having me some fun tonight, yeah</i>

779
01:42:03,038 --> 01:42:04,096
<i>Ahhh!</i>

780
01:42:17,619 --> 01:42:20,383
<i>Well, long, tall Sally</i>
<i>She's built sweet</i>

781
01:42:20,489 --> 01:42:23,253
<i>She's got everything that Uncle John needs</i>

782
01:42:23,358 --> 01:42:27,260
<i>Oh, baby, yeah, baby</i>

783
01:42:27,362 --> 01:42:32,061
<i>Ooh, baby, having me some fun tonight</i>

784
01:42:32,167 --> 01:42:35,728
<i>Have some fun</i>
<i>Having me some fun tonight</i>

785
01:46:51,192 --> 01:46:52,159

2
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,230
Sweetheart, remember that
you're doing pickup today

3
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,060
and you need to call the face
painter for the party.

4
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,430
Oh, and Henry needs more Lactaid.

5
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,630
All right. Got it.

6
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,230
Pick up the kids, call the face
painter, get Lactaid. I got it.

7
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,500
Also, I'm going to drop by the new house

8
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,600
and see how the work's coming.

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,740
Oh, okay, awesome.

10
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,900
Can you make sure that you measure

11
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,140
the backyard for the bouncy castle?

12
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,180
We're going to have
a bouncy castle at our birthday party?

13
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,550
- Do you want a bouncy castle?
- Yeah.

14
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,910
Then, yes, we'll have the best
bouncy castle in the whole world!

15
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,820
Bouncy castle! Bouncy castle!
Bouncy castle...

16
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,620
And an Ultimate Fighting Octagon?

17
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,090
Uh... I don't know about that.

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,460
But, hey, you talked to me!

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,580
I was talking to Mommy.

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,660
Okay, but just now, you talked
to me by saying that.

21
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,860
Why does she have such a problem?

22
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,990
It's just a phase. Don't push it.

23
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,620
Hey, sweetheart,
it hurts Daddy's feelings

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,170
when you give him the silent treatment.

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,440
I'm ready for school, I'm ready for
school! Pick me up, pick me up!

26
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,800
All right. Hey, Henry,

27
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,270
you know you can't bring Arthur to school.

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,780
But he's my best friend.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,000
Honey, he's your best lizard friend.

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,880
You've got lots of non-lizard friends.

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,000
Not really.

32
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,800
Really?

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,870
Nope.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,410
Oh. All right, have a good day.
I love you.

35
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,580
You're kidding me!

36
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,640
You can't take that to school, monkey.
Go put that in your room.

37
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,250
Sam, I will see you.
I love you.

38
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,590
- Sam.
- Hey.

39
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,150
What? Yeah, oh, golly, okay.
See you.

40
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,590
Thanks. Love you.

41
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,500
There he is!

42
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,640
Hey, Randy. How you doing?

43
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,700
Gregory Focker!

44
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,940
How's it going?

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,570
- Wonderful to see you.
- Great to see you.

46
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,110
Listen, I just came by to check
out the backyard and measure

47
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,580
Because we want to do a bouncy
castle for the kids birthday party.

48
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,020
Aw.

49
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,810
That's terrific, Gregory.

50
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,560
Okay, you're about five minutes late.

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,830
Yeah, I know.

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,200
A Miss Denslow from the
administrative board called.

53
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,210
She wants to get a list of the budget cuts.

54
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,270
You have a meeting in 20
minutes with John Raider

55
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,250
and some drug rep
from Pfosten Pharmaceuticals

56
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,110
is waiting in your office.
Andi something.

57
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,240
There's a drug rep in there?

58
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,340
Mmm-hmm.

59
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,850
Okay, look, in three minutes,

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,820
pop your head in and tell me
I have to go to my next meeting.

61
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,880
Okay. All right?

62
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,780
Sorry, I got to make this really quick.
I got a very busy morning.

63
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,060
I understand, Nurse Focker.
I'm Andi Garcia.

64
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,120
Oh, hi.

65
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,590
You have a lot less stubble in person.

66
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,260
I'm... There's an actor
named Andy Garcia.

67
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,600
Who?

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,540
Widow's peak. Sort of tough guy.

69
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,570
I was just kidding. Of course,
I know who Andy Garcia is.

70
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,670
I get that all the time.

71
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,270
Yeah. You must get it all the time

72
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,820
Because you're named Andi Garcia.

73
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,950
I loved the article you
wrote in the AMA Journal,

74
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,510
"Putting Patients First."

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,220
- You read that?
- I loved it.

76
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,020
It was so cool getting a nurse's
perspective on the health care crisis.

77
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,560
Yeah, that was the idea.

78
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,960
I actually started out
as a nurse, myself.

79
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,430
Really? Oh, well, nowadays,
I do less nursing and more...

80
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,970
Annoying meetings with drug
reps you'd rather not deal with?

81
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,770
Hey, Greg, it's time for your next meeting.

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,470
That's okay, I'm fine, Kristen.
Thank you.

83
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,740
Yeah, but he doesn't like to wait.

84
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,070
You know how he is, you know.

85
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,440
Well, it's John Raider?

86
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,740
Yeah, he's really picky...

87
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,980
He always runs late.
Always runs late. Thanks.

88
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,620
- You're swamped.
- No, I'm good. You want to have a seat?

89
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,940
Yeah.
Okay.

90
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,350
I'll make this quick.

91
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,690
So we are launching a
killer new product at Pfosten

92
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,700
and, while we usually hire
doctors to lead our presentations,

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,060
I have a feeling about you.

94
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,530
I think you have the potential
to be a medical superstar.

95
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,640
And you'd be perfect to
represent our new drug, Sustengo.

96
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,550
Ah. Sustengo. All right.
It's an erectile dysfunction medicine.

97
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,180
It's not just any erectile
dysfunction medicine.

98
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,880
It's the first ED pill on the
market safe for heart patients.

99
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,620
Because, in addition to increasing
the penile blood flow...

100
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,130
See that penis?

101
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,960
It acts as a beta blocker

102
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,400
to keep the heart rate
down during intercourse.

103
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,830
I mean, how dope is that?

104
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,230
That's pretty dope.

105
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,790
Nurse Focker needed in room 220 B, stat.

106
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,140
I'm sorry, hang on one second.

107
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,300
Nurse Focker, room 220 B.

108
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,700
Will you get out of my ass?

109
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,170
If you would stop squirming around...

110
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,580
But you don't know what you're doing.

111
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,340
It could have been over, sir.
Hey, hey, hey,

112
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,280
how you doing there, Mr. Androvsky?
Everything okay?

113
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,680
Well, this nurse is a barbarian.

114
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,880
Okay, I'm not a barbarian.

115
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,350
He keeps clenching and
I can't make an insertion.

116
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,580
Louis, it's...

117
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,780
It's a natural response
to protect that cavity.

118
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,260
You're right, it is a natural response.

119
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,290
I would protect my cavity, too.

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,760
And we just got to do
it a little bit gentler.

121
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,420
May I suggest something?

122
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,260
Sir, why don't you extend your left leg

123
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,600
and put your right knee right up to your chest.

124
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,300
It'll help relax things down there.

125
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,630
She's right.

126
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,230
You just do that and you just grab
the side of the bed there, like that,

127
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,470
and exhale... There you go.

128
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,600
Nurse, did you sufficiently
lubricate the nozzle?

129
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,110
- I did do that.
- Great.

130
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,770
- Good, good, okay.
- You got this?

131
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,110
Yep.

132
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,950
All right. Take a nice deep breath.

133
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,520
And focus on relaxing your anus.

134
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,650
Right. That's right.
You just want to let it dilate,

135
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,750
sort of like a flower opening up.

136
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,460
Blossoming lotus.

137
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,330
Sort of like a desert cactus.

138
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,690
Maturing.

139
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,830
It's okay.

140
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,500
Just a little, friendly
visitor just saying hello.

141
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,740
All right, I'm just going to
stick it in a little further.

142
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,900
Oh!

143
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,440
Good smooth insertion.

144
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,850
Thank you.

145
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,750
I'm going to release the clamp.
And let it flow.

146
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,490
Better.

147
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,180
How's that?

148
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,280
That was great.

149
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,990
Nice technique.

150
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,560
That was so fun.

151
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,770
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,400
I was thinking about it and, honestly,

153
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,240
I just don't have time to
moonlight pitching a drug right now.

154
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,540
Shot down.

155
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,270
No, it's not you. It's just...

156
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,370
No, I get it, you know.

157
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,850
Running nursing
in med-surge is a big job.

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,580
Yeah, yeah, so big,

159
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,410
I'm making less than I did
when I was in the ER.

160
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,050
Look, we are sponsoring
a convention at the Hilton.

161
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,150
Mmm-hmm.

162
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,020
You can make tons of dough
for, like, one speech.

163
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,080
Think about it.

164
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,790
Okay. I will, I'll think about it.
Okay.

165
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,460
Knuckles?

166
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,520
Knuckles.

167
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,730
That was bad-ass, by the way.

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,890
Yeah. Literally.

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,490
Dr. Bob.

170
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,140
Scumbag.

171
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,110
Jack, my taxi's here.

172
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,180
Oh, honey, I just got off with Deb.

173
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,340
They are officially separated.

174
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,640
Dr. Bob finished moving out.

175
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,340
That lowlife.

176
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,110
Yeah. You can say that again.

177
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,310
You sure you don't want me
to come with you?

178
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,750
No, you know, I think Deb needs

179
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,220
a little mother-daughter time, honey.

180
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,280
All right?

181
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,750
Having an affair with a nurse.

182
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,420
I can't believe I didn't
see the warning signs.

183
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,930
He was very discreet.

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,400
She didn't even know until
she saw those text messages.

185
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,460
Whatever you call them.

186
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,530
Yeah, but I'm trained to detect
that sort of behavior, honey,

187
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,040
and the truth is I was so busy
putting Focker through the wringer,

188
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,800
Dr. Bob slipped right under my radar.

189
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,540
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.

190
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,840
Well, I'll never let that happen again.

191
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,440
Are you having one of your
little heart palpies again, Jack?

192
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,850
My muscles are a little tight!

193
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,290
Yeah, yeah. From stress.

194
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,450
I can see that. Okay, will you
just, please, just relax, okay?

195
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,820
Everything is going to be all right. Honest.

196
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,030
- Oh, I got to go.
- Okay.

197
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,360
I'm going to miss you.

198
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,600
Hey, Mom.

199
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,840
Hello, my precious prince,
how are you, darling?

200
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,380
Good. How's the TV show going?

201
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,810
Oh, great. You know what this
week's episode is about?

202
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,220
Using the latest sexual toys
to spice up your love life.

203
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,280
- Really?
- Yeah.

204
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,720
As an early Hanukkah present,

205
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,350
I'm going to send you and Pam
a box of these musical condoms.

206
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,850
Don't do that.

207
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,720
You got to hear this, honey.
There's a little speaker inside.

208
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,460
And the faster you go,
the louder it gets.

209
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,400
You know what? Mom, Pam and I are fine.
We don't need musical condoms.

210
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,330
Honey, every couple can use
a little stimulation.

211
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,470
Oh, by the way,
interesting episode last week.

212
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,200
Which one? "Masturbation Through The Ages"?

213
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,440
I thought we agreed you weren't going to

214
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,640
talk about me on the air anymore.

215
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,910
Please, it was just a little
anecdote about carpal tunnel syndrome

216
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,880
from excessive self-pleasuring.

217
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,050
I have to connect your father now, okay?

218
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,980
We need to tell you something.

219
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,210
Ooh.

220
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,520
Hi! Gay? Roz?

221
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,820
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm here.

222
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,960
- Gaylord?
- Dad?

223
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,020
- Can you hear me?
- Where are you?

224
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,900
You won't believe it. I'm in Seville, Spain.

225
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,300
Where... What are you doing in Spain?

226
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,160
I'm studying.

227
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,370
Sweetheart, your father decided that

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
he's not going to make
it to the twins' party.

229
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,070
- What?
- Let me explain?

230
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,480
Gay, you remember
when your mother's show

231
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,710
hit number one in the ratings

232
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,340
and she signed on for a second year?

233
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,940
I looked in the mirror
and I said, "Who am I?"

234
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,020
Then I see this clip on the YouTube

235
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,920
and there is a Spanish guy
and he's dancing the flamenco.

236
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,120
And the sweat is pouring off of his face

237
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,960
and there is such passion in his eyes

238
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,790
- ...and I said, "That's it!"
- That's what?

239
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,730
That's me. I am flamenco!
I will master this art.

240
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,860
Dad, this is crazy. What are
you doing? You're in Spain?

241
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,060
You're going to miss the party?

242
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,660
You picked a hell of a time
to go through man-opause.

243
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,540
Roz, I am not going through man-opause,

244
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,340
I'm just trying to find my true north.

245
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,480
True north, huh?
What are you, a compass or something?

246
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,670
No, but let's face it.

247
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,910
I'm a stay-at-home dad

248
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,070
whose kid hasn't lived
at home in 25 years.

249
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,880
There's an Arthur Murray studio
right here in Miami Beach.

250
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,510
Why schlep all the way to Spain?

251
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,810
I can't believe you, Roz.

252
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,420
Why can't you support my dreams

253
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,960
the way I have always supported yours?

254
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,490
- Guys, guys...
- When you wanted to try

255
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,690
...new sex positions for your
research, I was your guinea pig!

256
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,890
You volunteered.

257
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,430
- I pulled my hamstring...
- Hey! Hey!

258
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,730
...doing a reverse cowgirl!

259
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,160
That's because you did it backwards.

260
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,660
I never went soft on you.

261
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,390
Bernie, do you hear
how you're upsetting your son?

262
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,300
- Let me talk.
- Listen, will you?

263
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,480
That son of a bitch.

264
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,490
Oh, shit.

265
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,330
Oh, shit.

266
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,800
- Hello?
- 911, what's your emergency?

267
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,440
Yeah, my name is Jack Byrnes.
I live at 28 Cherry Blossom Lane.

268
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,810
I'm going into cardiac arrest.

269
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,710
I need an ambulance right away.

270
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,440
I'm guessing your average
response time at this hour

271
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,140
is between 12 and 17 minutes.

272
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,590
I need you to do better than
that. Thank you, goodbye.

273
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,320
Stay calm, Mr. Jinx. I'm going
to defibrillate myself.

274
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,420
Clear!

275
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,160
Seriously, though, my dad,
he always sounds a little crazy,

276
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,800
but this was like a whole different level.

277
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,210
- No, I mean they were really going at it.
- Really?

278
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,870
She accused him of going through man-opause.

279
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,200
Is that a real thing?

280
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,910
Your parents have the best
marriage of anyone I know.

281
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,970
They will be fine.

282
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,850
Yeah, I guess so.

283
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,180
You were talking about the kids.

284
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,380
Really, their teacher
suggested private school?

285
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,860
Yeah, she said she was concerned
about them "getting lost"

286
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,450
in the public school system or something.

287
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,090
What's the name of this place?

288
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,700
The Early Human School.

289
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,200
I have absolutely heard of that place.

290
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,290
Sounds like a school for Neanderthals.

291
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,630
No, it's actually considered
the Harvard of kindergartens.

292
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,470
Mmm. Well, I think Harvard's cheaper.

293
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,770
I'll go see who that is.

294
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,280
Hey, greetings from the Black Sea.
You look terrific.

295
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,140
Hi, stranger, thanks.
What are you doing there?

296
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,190
Listen, Pam. Is there any way
I could speak to Greg?

297
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,620
I want to get his advice
on something, believe it or not.

298
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,710
Sure, absolutely. Hey, Greg?

299
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,810
Yeah.

300
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,920
Greg, honey, it's your buddy, Kevin.

301
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,220
Hold on. Thank you.

302
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,890
- Hey.
- Hey.

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,020
How you doing, man?

304
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,130
I was just doing a little sailing

305
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,290
and living the dream, G-Diggity-Dog.

306
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,520
- Cheers!
- Kevin.

307
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,300
- Hey.
- You need a refill on that

308
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,740
goji berry smoothie?

309
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,270
You read my mind. Fill her up, Pak-Man.

310
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,240
Greg, you know Deepak Chopra, right?

311
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,830
I know of him.

312
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,950
- Hi, Greg.
- Hi, Mr. Chopra.

313
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,640
Dr. Chopra.

314
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,080
Get out of here, you rascal.

315
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:36,320
So, listen, the reason why
I'm calling is because next week...

316
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,320
Kevin, who do you Skype with?

317
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,090
I am just talking to my friend, Greg Focker.

318
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,920
- Hey.
- Come here.

319
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,970
Hey, honey, what'd you
do with Henry's Lactaid?

320
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,900
Oh, crap, I forgot. Sorry.

321
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,500
Well, okay.
But did you call the face-paint lady?

322
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,730
No, I'm sorry.

323
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,570
I had, like, 97 things to do, so...

324
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,480
Honey, I asked you to do
two things, that's all I asked.

325
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,980
I know. Sorry, babe.

326
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,610
Okay, so here's the dealio.

327
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,020
I'm going to propose to Svetlana.

328
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,190
You're going to propose? That's incredible.

329
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,590
I'm going to have three Russian
MiG fighter jets fly by

330
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,030
and skywrite "Marry me, Svetlana."

331
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,090
And then I'm going to hide a 50-carat
super-tasteful diamond ring

332
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,440
in this tin of extremely rare beluga.

333
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,000
Then we will finish the night

334
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,940
with a special performance
that I choreographed

335
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,540
with members of the Bolshoi
Ballet, dedicated to our love.

336
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,670
Thoughts?

337
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,410
Honestly, I'm thinking maybe
it's a little too involved.

338
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,610
Yeah?

339
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,750
I mean, with Pam, my whole thing was just

340
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,050
keep it simple, speak from the heart.

341
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,960
Keep it simple and speak from
the heart. I like it, hombre.

342
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,400
You know what? I'd better call
off some Russian MiG fighter jets.

343
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,400
And, hey, by the time I get to Chi-town,

344
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,340
this old dog here
could be an engaged man.

345
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,800
Hey, Kevin? Yeah.

346
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,870
The jet skis are ready!

347
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,930
The jet skis are ready?

348
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,670
Well, fire them up for me.
Okay.

349
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,510
I'll be right there.

350
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,280
Jet-skiing monks.

351
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,020
Wow, I cannot believe that Kevin
is finally settling down.

352
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,450
Well, I think he's found a soul mate.

353
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,550
Yeah?

354
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,960
Hey, you're going to eat some of this.
She seemed nice.

355
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,900
Yeah. I am very happy for Kevin.

356
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,090
I love him, especially when he's
not obsessed with you.

357
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,090
Oh, come on. You're being ridiculous.

358
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,090
Oh, you got it?

359
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,460
Hey, sweetheart, will you please

360
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,700
take a bite of the lasagna, honey?

361
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,830
- No.
- Uh-uh. Do you not like it?

362
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,140
Hey, what's the good word, Grandpa Jack?

363
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,570
Yay!

364
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,700
Greg.

365
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,010
This is Jack Byrnes.

366
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,140
Yeah, I know. I could tell
from the caller ID.

367
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,370
How are you doing?

368
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,650
Greg, excuse yourself from the table
by saying these exact words,

369
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,060
"I don't know if I still have it,
but let me check my files."

370
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,420
What? If Pam asks you what I want,

371
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,100
tell her that I asked you to locate
your birth certificate

372
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,490
for my genealogical work.

373
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,100
Just do it.

374
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,430
I don't know if I have that,
Jack, but let me check my files.

375
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,600
Files? You have files?

376
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,040
Yes, yeah, I do. I keep files.

377
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,410
He wants me to get my birth certificate

378
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,350
for that family tree thing he's doing.

379
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,880
Jack? Everything okay?

380
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,450
Everything is fine, Greg, I suffered
a minor heart attack,

381
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,320
but I was able to defibrillate myself

382
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,150
before going into fatal cardiac arrest.

383
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,550
Jesus! You defibrillated yourself?

384
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,030
The doctor said I was a lucky man

385
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,360
and I've just got to watch my diet

386
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,630
and keep my stress level down.

387
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,530
Wow, okay, so I guess

388
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,590
you guys aren't going to be able to
come to the twins' birthday party.

389
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,040
No, Dina and I will be there
as planned, Greg.

390
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,770
And I was able to keep this
on a need-to-know basis.

391
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,540
And right now, you're the only
person who needs to know.

392
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,740
Well, come on, Jack. I mean, I think
Dina needs to know.

393
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,280
Greg, stop talking and listen.

394
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,480
Okay.

395
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,750
Now, my genealogical research has
allowed me to track the Byrnes family

396
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,720
as far back as 1643.

397
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,350
1643?

398
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,160
Now, I wouldn't be able to do
that, say, to your family,

399
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,560
what with all the wandering
peddlers and nameless peasants.

400
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,660
Mmm-hmm.

401
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,720
But, as long as there have been Byrneses,

402
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,130
there's always been a patriarch

403
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,190
to lead our family through
good times and bad.

404
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,140
And I've finally come to the realization

405
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,440
that the next in line to the throne, Greg,

406
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,570
is you.

407
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,200
Me.

408
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,640
Yes, you, Greg.

409
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,110
Well... So my question is this,

410
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,520
in the event of my demise, are you
prepared to lead this family?

411
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,050
You know, Jack, we're right
in the middle of dinner.

412
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,460
Maybe we could talk about this,
you know, when you come into town.

413
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,620
If I go down, Greg, I need to
know someone will be responsible

414
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,460
for the whole Byrnes clan.

415
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,090
So I ask you, Greg, are you prepared to be

416
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,190
the Godfocker?

417
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,100
The Godfocker?

418
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,970
The Godfocker.

419
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,310
Well, that is a very powerful
turn of phrase, Jack.

420
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,010
And when you say Godfocker,
I mean... 

421
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,080
I mean, I think I know what
you mean, but I'm just...

422
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,790
What exactly does that mean?

423
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,590
It's an attitude, Greg.
It's a confidence.

424
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,820
It's the way you carry yourself

425
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,420
that lets the world know that
the buck stops with you.

426
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,200
Yeah, I hear you. Mmm-hmm.

427
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,410
None of this can be achieved
without the basics.

428
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,740
A secure home for your family,

429
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,740
a top-notch education for your children...

430
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,870
Okay.

431
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,780
...and last but not least, having
your financial house in order, Greg.

432
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,910
Is that it?

433
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,450
Are you laughing?

434
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,180
Yeah, no, I'm just...
I was making... No.

435
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,840
Because this is no laughing matter, Greg.

436
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,480
Good, because I'm not laughing. Okay?

437
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,960
Are you saying you have what
it takes to be the Godfocker?

438
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,020
Greg?

439
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,760
Yes, Jack. I have what it takes

440
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,310
to be the Godfocker.

441
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,880
I feel like a great weight has
been lifted off my shoulders.

442
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,410
And an equally great weight put onto yours.

443
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,370
I like it. I like the weight. I want it.

444
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,410
All right. Need-to-know.

445
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,850
Need-to-know. Just you and me.

446
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,950
See you in two weeks.

447
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,860
Okay. Bye.

448
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,300
Hey, did you find it?

449
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,030
Find what?

450
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,030
Your birth certificate?

451
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,770
Yes. It was in my files.

452
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,830
Mmm.

453
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,700
You know, I was thinking, maybe we should

454
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,010
take a look at that Early Human School.

455
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,210
Great. I'll make some phone
calls and set up a tour.

456
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,350
- Good.
- Good.

457
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,080
Samantha.

458
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,050
Henry.

459
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,660
You going to have your lasagna?

460
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,460
No, thank you.

461
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,840
You know, your mother worked very
hard making that lasagna for you.

462
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,930
No. It tastes funny.

463
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,040
He said he was feeling
kind of queasy, so...

464
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,670
It's okay.

465
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,180
Henry,

466
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,310
I'm your father and I'm requesting
of you to eat the lasagna.

467
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,890
Fine.

468
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,790
Good.

469
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,210
- Hello.
- Hello?

470
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,010
Greg? This is Jack Byrnes.

471
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,050
Jack Byrnes, this is Greg Focker.

472
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,780
I know, Greg. I called you.

473
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,180
Dina and I will be there
in approximately 18 seconds.

474
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,650
Eighteen seconds, got it.

475
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,540
Oh, no, that's yours, honey.

476
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,940
Welcome, in-laws!

477
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,010
Oh, Gregor. My goodness.

478
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,710
Dina, Dina Bobina, Banana Fana Fofina.

479
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,610
I'm so happy to see you.

480
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,240
Lovely Dina.

481
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,710
You, too, Gregor.

482
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,480
Hello, Jack.

483
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,580
Greg.

484
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,690
Everything okay, Greg?

485
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,880
Everything's great.

486
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,150
Good.

487
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,360
Unfortunately, renovations on the house,

488
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,260
not quite where I'd like them to be.

489
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,800
Well, those things happen.

490
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,330
They do. I mean, never to me before.

491
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,880
And Sam here has done very, very
well with her tae kwon do lessons.

492
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,940
She's a... What are you?
A yellow belt now?

493
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,040
Yep.

494
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,140
Yellow belt.

495
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,480
Wow, sweetheart. Very impressive.

496
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,890
She's lethal. She is a ninja.

497
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,050
Proud of her.

498
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,360
Now, Henry, you're going to
drink your milk, aren't you?

499
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,550
You want to hit the same
growth spurt as your sister.

500
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,650
Jack.

501
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,990
I'm just saying, you know,
it's hard to believe

502
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,190
that they're three minutes apart.

503
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,260
Shh.

504
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,300
Henry, do what your grandpa says.

505
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,130
Aw, man. For real.

506
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,200
Good man.

507
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,940
Okay. Who wants some turkey?

508
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,600
I do, right here! Right here!

509
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,880
Sweetheart, you didn't have to
make a whole turkey just for us.

510
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,940
Why not?

511
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,070
Actually, Greg did it.

512
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,540
Greg.

513
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,450
Well, I remember
at last year's Thanksgiving,

514
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,220
Jack said he liked roast turkey so much

515
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,380
and he couldn't understand why people
only had it once a year.

516
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,150
Excellent memory, Greg.

517
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,490
Plus, it's a wonderfully lean meat.
Healthy. Good for your heart.

518
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,190
Such a sweetheart.

519
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,470
Grandpa Jack, can I ask you a question?

520
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,870
You surely can.

521
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,600
How come you're afraid of lizards?

522
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,300
Henry, that's a very good question.
And I'll tell you why.

523
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,400
When I was stationed in the Mekong
Delta during the Vietnam War,

524
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,070
a tiny gecko crawled into my ear one
night and laid its eggs.

525
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:58,780
And I had to endure the torturous
probing of our unit's medic

526
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,950
to remove the lizard larvae
from my ear canal

527
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,080
before they hatched into my brain.

528
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,320
Jack.

529
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,380
Cool.

530
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,920
Yuck.

531
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,480
Yes, thanks for sharing that, Dad.

532
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,290
All right, gobble, gobble, everybody!
It's turkey time!

533
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,430
That looks good.
That's a work of art.

534
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,600
Thank you very much.

535
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,700
Looks great, Greg.

536
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,610
Thank you, Jack. And to carve it,

537
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,170
I thought we might use the beautiful
Irish hunting knife

538
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,480
emblazoned with the Byrnes family crest

539
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,110
that Jack so thoughtfully
brought back for us

540
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,280
from his ancestral homeland.

541
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,820
- Look at that, kids.
- Great.

542
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,190
Wow. Look at that.

543
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,230
See that crest?
That was used by your ancestors

544
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,530
long time ago, back in the olden days,
to identify their family.

545
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,460
Daddy, can I ask you a question?

546
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,470
Absolutely. He loves history.
Just soaks it up.

547
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,170
Can a girl poop from her vagina?

548
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,540
No, she cannot.

549
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,900
They're a little young for genealogy.

550
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,000
Yes.

551
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,710
Just a little off topic there.

552
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,110
Jack. Here you go!

553
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,290
Greg. You're the turkey carver now.

554
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,780
Thank you. I'm honored.

555
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,420
All right. Let's carve the roast beast!

556
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,520
Mmm.

557
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,150
Let's see. I think I'll start right side.

558
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,720
Nice and tender.

559
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,760
So, Greg, how are you liking your new job?

560
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,730
Well, I'll tell you, Dina,

561
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,800
it's a lot of responsibility on my plate.

562
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,870
But that's kind of what I love about it.

563
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,970
I mean, the opportunity
to manage an entire unit,

564
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,640
in a way, it's kind of like...

565
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,680
Christ! Shit!

566
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,720
Why couldn't you just get him
a warm-blooded animal?

567
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,290
- Pressure.
- Mom!

568
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,580
Honey. It's okay, it's okay, honey.

569
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,490
- Hello.
- Where is he going? Are you okay?

570
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,760
Hey, Kevin!

571
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,660
It's Kevin, everybody.

572
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,720
What? Okay.

573
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,900
You're in Chicago?

574
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,580
Hey. Hey.

575
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,780
- Hey, everybody. Hello.
- Kevin.

576
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,180
J.B.

577
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,380
Oh! Good to see you.

578
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,450
There he is! The engaged guy!

579
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,680
How you doing, man?

580
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,910
Oh! What happened to your pointer?

581
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,480
I had a little incident with the business
end of a turkey. It's cool.

582
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,720
- Where's Svetlana?
- Yeah!

583
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,700
Or should I say, the future
Mrs. Kevin Rawley?

584
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,060
She broke up with me.

585
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,030
- No.
- Oh.

586
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,160
You're kidding.

587
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,360
I'm so sorry.

588
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,500
Thanks, Pam.

589
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,470
You always know exactly
the right thing to say to me.

590
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,230
"I'm so sorry"?

591
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,000
My anchor.

592
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,470
What happened?

593
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,410
- What?
- What happened?

594
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,390
I don't know. I'm still trying to
make sense of it myself.

595
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,510
We were having some street food

596
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,580
outside a government building in Bulgaria

597
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,680
and I said, "Hey, you want to get married?"

598
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,660
And I took out a little piece of string

599
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,590
and I tied the twine around her finger,

600
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,790
and she just... She threw it on
the ground and said no.

601
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,490
Or nyet, because she's Russian.

602
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,600
She caught the next plane out of there.
Adios, Kevin.

603
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,800
Your proposal seems way out of character.

604
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,600
Why did you put so little effort into it?

605
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,970
Greg told me to.

606
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,980
What are you...
Kevin, no, no.

607
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,180
- What are you talking about? I didn't...
- Daddy?

608
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,510
I can't sleep.

609
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,410
Still in diapers.

610
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,220
No, Jack, they're pull-ups.
We're weaning him off diapers.

611
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,640
What's up, man?

612
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,390
I can't stop thinking about all that blood.

613
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,520
Really? All right, well,
how about I read you a story?

614
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,990
Uncle Kevin!

615
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,390
How you doing, tiger?

616
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,130
- Good.
- Oh!

617
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,220
Wow.

618
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,360
Are you having a hard time sleeping?

619
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,870
- Yeah.
- Oh.

620
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,170
There we go.

621
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,230
Jesus. Henry?

622
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,710
- Are you...
- Shh. He's sleeping.

623
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,240
He's sleeping. I put him in a still-point.

624
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,050
It's a massage technique

625
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,110
that relaxes the body by gently

626
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,420
easing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.

627
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,120
Yeah. Look at him.

628
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,320
He's going to wake up feeling so refreshed.

629
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,320
I've been studying a lot of Eastern
medicine in my down time.

630
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,360
Well, listen, I just came by
to say my hellos,

631
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,920
so I will head on out.

632
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,020
- Good.
- Okay.

633
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,160
Hey, Kev, listen,
do you need a place to stay?

634
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,470
No, he doesn't.
You got a place to stay, right?

635
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,100
- And we're pretty full up.
- Not a problem.

636
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,010
I volunteer at a South Side
homeless shelter.

637
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,480
So, I'll probably stay there

638
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,980
and just work the soup kitchen
line in the morning.

639
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,140
That is so wonderful, Kevin.

640
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,340
Yeah, it's funny, I feed them food,

641
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,650
but those vagrants
and drifters feed my soul,

642
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,820
so it works out pretty good for all of us.

643
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,190
Perfect. We always need extra hands,

644
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,950
if you guys want to come on down tomorrow...

645
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,530
Actually, Greg and I are taking a tour
of this place called

646
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,290
the Early Human School tomorrow.

647
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,490
But maybe after...
You're kidding me,

648
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,690
the Early Human School?

649
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,090
Right.

650
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,900
My investment group
handles their endowment fund.

651
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,800
In fact, the director, Prudence,

652
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,630
is a dear friend and ex-lover of mine.

653
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,180
I'm going to put in a good word for you.

654
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,330
That would be great, wouldn't it?

655
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,570
Oh, of course.

656
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,310
Or not. I mean, you know, she's an
ex-lover, I think that'd be awkward.

657
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,180
No, nonsense. I'm on great terms with
all my ex-lovers.

658
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,020
- Thanks.
- Sure.

659
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,420
Okay. All right,
well, you know, whatever feels right.

660
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,290
After the tour, Greg, I was hoping
you'd show us your new house.

661
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,660
And, Kevin,
when you're done feeding the bums,

662
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,990
why don't you meet us there?

663
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,660
Okay. I'll be there.

664
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,670
You know what, Jack? I still have
some items on the punch list

665
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,760
to go through with the contractors,

666
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,600
so I'm thinking maybe we should
put it off for a few days.

667
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,540
Ah, no, let's do it tomorrow.
Well, I think...

668
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,940
We'll meet you there at noon, Kevin.
I don't know.

669
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,570
- At noon?
- Yeah, all right. Okay.

670
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,230
And we're going to get you through this.

671
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,510
Anything you need, you come to me.

672
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,740
Okay. Thanks, J.B.

673
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,210
Yeah. Or me.

674
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,810
Okay.

675
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,720
Well, you can come to either of us.

676
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,980
Yeah, we're here for you.

677
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,220
Thanks.

678
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,320
Careful, yeah.

679
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,060
- I feel like crap.
- Yeah.

680
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,350
You're burning up.

681
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,370
Yeah, I must have gotten the flu the
kids had last week.

682
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,490
Oh, my God, the school tour is today.

683
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,560
Yeah, I know.

684
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,900
Honey, what am I going to do?

685
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,200
I'll do it. Okay? I'll handle it.

686
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,260
- Yeah?
- Yeah, and your mom

687
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,430
can take the kids to school.

688
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,980
But what about my dad?

689
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,670
I got it, all right?

690
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,250
I really appreciate your including
me on the school tour, Greg.

691
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,310
Oh, Jack, you are a trusted advisor.

692
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,220
I mean, your words hit home about a
top-notch education,

693
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,590
getting your financial house in order.

694
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,990
That's it. That's it.

695
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,290
It's all about the kids, right?

696
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,590
The next generation.

697
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,860
I'm glad to hear you say that.

698
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,690
Makes me feel that I've chosen wisely.

699
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,700
Of course, children change everything
in a marriage,

700
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,330
and that was the issue with Debbie and Bob.

701
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:29,070
They stopped finding time for each
other once LJ came into their lives,

702
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,440
so Bob sought sexual fulfillment
outside the marriage.

703
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,500
Mmm.

704
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,580
- Dr. Bob.
- Dr. Bob.

705
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,110
He really disappointed me.

706
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,350
I'll tell you something. I'd like to
really teach that bastard a lesson.

707
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,640
I happen to have his new address.

708
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,350
Perhaps you and I should
sneak in there one night

709
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,720
and plant a tiny explosive device in
the stove.

710
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,660
Make it look like a gas leak.

711
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,960
Yeah. Yeah.

712
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,100
Or we could, you know, maybe

713
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,470
find some less criminal way
of teaching him a lesson.

714
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,630
You know, still get him.

715
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,440
I'm only joking, Greg.

716
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,770
Okay.

717
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,670
But it would be fun.

718
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,730
Yeah, oh, it would be great.

719
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,270
I'm hoping that you and Pam are still
finding time for each other.

720
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,240
Oh, yeah.

721
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,150
- Yeah, are you kidding?
- Yeah, no, no, we're great, we're...

722
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,240
Good.

723
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,580
I mean, you know, it's not easy.

724
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,820
You got to work at it, but...

725
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,160
Are you still physically attracted
to my daughter, Greg?

726
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:25,360
To Pam? Are you kidding? Yes. Jack,
there's never been a problem with that.

727
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,270
Even after her body's endured the
hellish ordeal of birthing twins?

728
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,840
Yes. Even after that. It's still... It's
all good. It's all good under the hood.

729
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,510
That's disgusting.

730
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,180
Welcome, parents.

731
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,520
I'm Prudence Simmons, director of the
Early Human School.

732
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,250
And at E.H.S., we know.

733
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,530
We know that no two early humans are alike.

734
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:09,170
So why should their educational
experiences be identical? Right?

735
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,170
Makes sense.

736
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,210
It's not about the 99.8% of graduates

737
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,910
that go on to the best secondary schools.

738
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,980
Wow, impressive.

739
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,040
Yeah.

740
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,650
That guy's really been
hitting the Bow flex, huh?

741
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,710
What?

742
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,620
It's not the overwhelming number
of Early Human alumni

743
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,960
that become civic leaders, CEOs of
Fortune 500 companies. No.

744
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:38,900
What's important to us is that they
become themselves.

745
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:42,440
Please welcome the Early Human Tumblers!

746
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,740
Whoo!

747
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,280
Kids are really good.

748
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,150
I like what I'm seeing from this place.

749
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,020
Yeah. And I'm sure it doesn't come cheap.

750
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,610
Mmm-mmm.

751
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,180
You think you can swing it?

752
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,250
Mmm-hmm.

753
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,030
Yeah. Yeah, I got it covered.

754
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,260
And, you know,

755
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,230
if it's not covered right now, it
will be covered.

756
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,060
It's one of those things that you cover it.

757
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,330
Do you have the money or not, Greg?

758
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,730
New friends, hello!

759
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,900
Hi.

760
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,000
Hi, I'm Prudence. Greg?

761
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,060
Greg. How are you?

762
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,340
- Jack?
- Jack Byrnes.

763
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,780
So, Jack and Greg,
tell me what path you've chosen.

764
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,710
How do you make a "living"?

765
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,150
Oh, okay, well, I'm a nurse.

766
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,540
Oh.

767
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,040
He's being modest.

768
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,820
He's actually the department manager
of the medical-surgical unit

769
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,620
at Chicago Memorial
and I am a retired florist.

770
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,290
What a combination, a nurse and a florist?

771
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,060
How great.

772
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,100
May I ask how long you've been
in each other's lives?

773
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,470
Oh, I'd say... Well, it's about eight
years, hasn't it been?

774
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,770
Yeah, eight years.

775
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,230
- I'd say eight years.
- Really?

776
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,430
Yeah, yeah. Eight great years. Yeah.

777
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,770
Eight great years.

778
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,500
Well, it started out a little rocky.

779
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,040
We've had our moments.

780
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,670
Yes, but then we figured it out.

781
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,910
You seem like a wonderful couple.

782
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,350
- No, no, no. We're not homosexuals.
- Yeah, no.

783
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,180
No, no. No, no, no, no,
this is my son-in-law.

784
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,480
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no.

785
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:09,050
However, if you're looking to fill a
quota, we can be flexible.

786
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,560
Okay, that's an interesting joke,

787
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,570
but I appreciate levity in a moment
of misunderstanding,

788
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,030
so thank you, Greg.

789
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,730
I will say, Jack,
I hope I didn't offend you.

790
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh. No, no.

791
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,060
Really?

792
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,240
No. I mean, I'm not gay myself,
but if I were gay,

793
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,150
I would certainly be proud to choose a
life partner like Gay Focker.

794
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,240
And that's his actual name.

795
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,910
Oh.

796
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,110
It is. Well, it's my, Gaylord was
my name when I was a kid and, yeah.

797
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,910
Well, I'll complete
the conversation with that.

798
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,020
Jack.

799
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,490
Prudence. Pleasure.

800
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,960
- Gay. Great.
- Greg.

801
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,830
Change that nametag.

802
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,660
You can call... It's Greg. Greg is fine.

803
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,400
Why don't we just stick with the truth?

804
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,370
An original American Foursquare,
Greg, very nice.

805
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:05,320
Yeah, yeah. It's got rock-solid bones
and, you know, it's...

806
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,420
Hey! There they are.

807
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,330
- Kev-O, that's quite a rental.
- Yeah.

808
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,190
Gustavo, my assistant, hooked it up.

809
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,200
I guess it's a Tesla Roadster or something.

810
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,000
Supposedly eco-friendly,
like that 2003 Prius, Greg.

811
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,200
Yeah, you got it.

812
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,830
Wow. It looks great.

813
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,840
Traditional American Foursquare.

814
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,540
Also known as a Prairie Box.

815
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,310
- Yeah.
- It's got really good bones.

816
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,070
Good eye, Kev.

817
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,010
Look out for your legs.

818
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,510
That's good.

819
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,580
Randy? Randy, what is this?

820
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,620
Gregory Focker!

821
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,320
Great to see you. How you doing, Dad?

822
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,420
Hey.

823
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,790
Randy, what is this? We're having
the party here in two days.

824
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,330
Um...

825
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,830
Refresh my memory, Gregory.

826
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,860
Are you kidding me? Randy, the twins
birthday party, remember?

827
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,160
Yes, of course!

828
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,830
The issue we're dealing with is

829
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,270
that we had to excavate 60 feet
of root-infested pipe back here!

830
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,140
So, of course, we ran into some
unexpected costs

831
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,840
along with an obvious delay.

832
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,400
Randy, is this yard gonna be done
or is it not gonna be done?

833
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,920
Jack, I got this. All right?

834
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,380
All Mr. Byrnes is suggesting is
that maybe inadvertently

835
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,520
you're taking advantage
of a gentle, trusting soul

836
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,530
who clearly is an amateur when
it comes to home construction.

837
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,490
- No, Kevin.
- Thank you, Swami Salami.

838
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,890
That's not true at all.

839
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,290
It is true, Greg. They're ripping you off.

840
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,160
No, Jack... Your plumbing excavators

841
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,270
have been on coffee break
for the past eight minutes,

842
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,330
this senior citizen over here
is unfit for active duty

843
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,810
and your backhoe driver's halfway
through a Sudoku puzzle.

844
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,930
- All right.
- Gregory,

845
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,840
who is this joker questioning my honor?

846
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,680
Nobody's questioning your honor, Randy.

847
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,540
I'm 34 years in the trade!

848
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,810
Thirty-four years, huh?

849
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,750
I got to pump, dump and hump to
get that backyard whole again!

850
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,810
Well, I got news for you.
You can pump, dump and hump all you want!

851
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,380
You're sandbagging this damn job
and you know it.

852
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,480
All right. You know what?
Jack, Jack, Jack!

853
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,490
Calm down! 
You're leaving a big hole, you...

854
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,590
Hey, General! The Japanese surrendered!

855
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,030
The Japanese surrendered! That's it!

856
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,500
What are you talking about?

857
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,330
World War II.

858
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,030
I'll tell you what, Gregor.
I have a timeshare in town.

859
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,330
Why don't we have the party there?

860
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,100
Beautiful meadow. It'll be perfect.

861
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,970
No, no, Kevin, I promised the kids

862
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,770
they're going to have the party in the yard.

863
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,280
So, guess what? We're going to have the
party in the yard. Okay?

864
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,410
Soon as our dump truck driver's
back from lunch,

865
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,180
we'll get that out, bring the backhoe in,

866
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,880
lay down your base layer of sand.

867
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,620
Wait a minute. You're telling us
that you can't move that rig?

868
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,380
That's a union job, pops.

869
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,260
Screw it. I'm going to
move that truck myself.

870
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,320
- No, come on.
- No, you know what, Jack?

871
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,730
I'll do it, okay? You just help me

872
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,360
back it out into the street. I got it.

873
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,660
Here we go.

874
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,960
All right, start backing her up.
You're all clear.

875
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,140
Coming at you, Jack!

876
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,070
You're doing great, you're doing great.

877
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,540
Hey, look, I'm not in the union, Randy!
I'm backing up the truck!

878
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,310
Come on. Back, back, back. Doing
great. Doing great! Doing great!

879
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,150
Whoa! Whoa!

880
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,380
Brake it!

881
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,880
Oh!

882
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,480
You got it!

883
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,730
- We're good.
- Emergency brake!

884
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,020
Got it!

885
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,040
Jack! Holy shit!

886
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,400
Hang on, I'm with you!

887
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,400
Jack, I'm right here.
Jack, we're going to get you!

888
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,540
It's going to be all right, Jack!

889
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,000
Jack, we're coming! Hang on, Jack!

890
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,200
I got him!

891
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,270
I got you.

892
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,240
It's Kevin. I'm right here.

893
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,220
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Save your strength.

894
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,380
Upsy-daisy. Greg's right here. He's okay.

895
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,380
Yeah, I see him.

896
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,920
Hey, Jack.

897
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,190
Oh, here, it's starting.

898
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's The Roz Focker Show!

899
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,170
And that means it's time
to sexpress yourself!

900
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,640
Hello, my audience!

901
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,470
Hello, my friends. Welcome.

902
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,270
Today, what do you think
we're going to talk about?

903
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,470
Sex! Sex. Sex.

904
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,920
Well, what else is she going to talk about?

905
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,180
Sex after children.

906
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,310
How do you find time to make love

907
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,910
with young children in the house?

908
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,650
What do you do if it's not working?

909
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,920
Do you have an affair?

910
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,460
No!

911
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,160
No, you say? But Roz Focker says yes!

912
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,760
Yes, you do have an affair!

913
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,410
You have an affair with your wife!

914
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,170
Oh, Roz!

915
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,640
Think about it, right?

916
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,150
You dress up a little nicer.
You meet at a hotel.

917
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,680
You role play.

918
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,890
There is absolutely no shame in playing
out a fantasy, but with each other!

919
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,550
All right?

920
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,290
Now, he's going to kill me,

921
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,190
but my own son, who is the father
of two adorable twins,

922
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,670
he has issues in this department.

923
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,570
He's busy at work. She's busy at home.

924
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,470
Their intimacy numbers are down.
They're not connecting.

925
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,140
And what do you do?

926
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,940
- It's called Sustengo.
- Sustengo?

927
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,010
I got to say, that sounds
pretty cheesy, Greg.

928
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,320
Yeah, well, I'm looking at these
Randy Weir bills, okay.

929
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,550
And we could definitely use the money.

930
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,490
And do me a favor. Don't tell
your dad about this, okay?

931
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,850
My dad? Why?

932
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,620
Just because he's been all into

933
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,560
me having my financial house
in order or whatever,

934
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,290
- ...and I just don't want to worry him.
- All right, fine.

935
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,360
I won't say anything because
he's already pretty upset

936
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,460
about you trying to bury him alive.

937
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,830
Honey, it was an accident.

938
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,100
Superstar!

939
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,600
Hey. Hey, can you hang on a second?

940
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,660
Okay.

941
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,840
I am so stoked you changed your mind.

942
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,050
You are going to rock
those urologists tonight.

943
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,670
Awesome. That's always been a goal of mine.

944
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,040
So, I'll see you at 8:00 at the Hilton?

945
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,110
Yes.

946
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,150
- And wear a suit.
- Wear a suit, got it.

947
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,740
- Knuckles?
- Knuckles.

948
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,910
Okay, bye.

949
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,850
- Hey.
- Hello.

950
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,420
Knuckles? Who was that?

951
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,150
That certainly didn't sound like Kristen.

952
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,420
No, no. That was the drug rep.

953
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,630
- Andi?
- Yeah, Andi.

954
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,120
What does she look like?

955
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,660
She's like a...
No, she's, like, an ex-nurse.

956
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,930
You wouldn't pick her out of a lineup.

957
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,370
Yeah, I know that you're doing this for us,

958
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,170
but the idea of you and
some woman named Andi

959
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,340
selling boner medicine at a hotel,
it really kind of icks me out.

960
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,680
Honey, there's nothing
to be icked out about.

961
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,380
Okay, fine.

962
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,580
- I love you.
- I love you, too, honey. Bye.

963
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,850
Okay, bye.

964
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,950
So, how come you're not talking to Daddy?

965
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,590
Because he said you were cuckoo.

966
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,460
He said I was cuckoo?

967
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,790
Mmm-hmm.

968
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,860
Well, we'll have to discuss that.

969
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,320
Yeah.

970
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,030
But what about Mommy and Daddy?

971
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,330
Is everything okay with them?

972
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,240
I guess they fight sometimes.

973
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,470
Mmm-hmm. And what do they fight about?

974
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,870
Um...

975
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:44,040
Like Mommy got mad at Daddy because he
was going to the hotel with Andi.

976
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,110
Andi?

977
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:48,680
Who's Andi?

978
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,720
I can't say because I'm not
supposed to be spying.

979
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,950
Like I always tell you, there's
nothing wrong with spying

980
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,460
as long as you suspect foul play.

981
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,930
So, who's Andi?

982
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,700
Andi gives Daddy his boners.

983
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,600
His what?

984
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,970
Andi gives Daddy his boners.

985
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,560
Uh-huh.

986
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,800
Hey, guys!

987
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,240
- Hey, Greg.
- How was your day?

988
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,910
Yeah. Great.

989
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,370
Hey.

990
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,710
How about you, Sam?

991
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,750
What? Come on, say something to me.

992
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,020
No! I won't!

993
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,060
Ah! You just did.

994
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,260
- Hey, Greg?
- Yeah.

995
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,860
I'm not so sure

996
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,260
using chicanery and
subterfuge on your daughter

997
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,430
is the best way to get her
to communicate with you.

998
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,730
No, no, no. That's not
chicanery and subterfuge.

999
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,430
For whatever it's worth.

1000
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,600
Worth a lot. Thank you.

1001
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,640
And I will see you later, okay?

1002
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,800
I got roped into this hospital
administration dinner thing tonight, so...

1003
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,410
- Work function?
- Yeah.

1004
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,640
It's the price of being
in charge of the unit, so...

1005
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,720
I see. That last minute, huh?

1006
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,810
Yeah.

1007
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,950
Department head called so I got to
do a little face time and...

1008
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,590
- Have fun.
- Okay.

1009
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,920
Hmm.

1010
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,380
Jack?

1011
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,850
Jack!

1012
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,620
Is that you?

1013
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,460
- Greg.
- What are you doing out here?

1014
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,960
Just picking up some milk for the morning.

1015
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,790
- You looking for a market?
- Yeah.

1016
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,660
Okay, because there's one
right across from the house.

1017
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,330
Oh, is there? I didn't know that.

1018
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,070
Just take a left on Lincoln. Right there.

1019
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,370
- Thanks, Greg.
- Okay.

1020
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,600
- See you later.
- Okay.

1021
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,620
Excuse me.

1022
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,290
Hey!

1023
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,590
Greg.

1024
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,170
Hey, man. You following me?

1025
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,640
Following you? Why would I be following you?

1026
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,340
No, I'm just looking for milk.

1027
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,270
Okay. Because, remember, I mentioned
out on the street there,

1028
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,870
there's a store right in the neighborhood.

1029
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,910
True, but Dina likes the organic stuff

1030
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:09,450
and I heard there was a natural
food market downtown.

1031
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,310
Amazing, you going all this way
just for a carton of milk.

1032
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,350
You know what? You should get off here.

1033
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,760
There's a really great natural foods market

1034
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,660
about two blocks south of the station.

1035
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,260
Oh.

1036
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,170
Have a good night, Jack.

1037
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,610
You, too, Greg.

1038
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,720
Hey.

1039
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,690
Oh! Hey.

1040
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,390
Superstar!

1041
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,100
Everything cool? You seem a little edgy.

1042
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:05,210
No, I'm good. It's just my
in-laws are in town, so...

1043
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,940
Anyway, I went over the drug info

1044
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,570
and I think I got the science
down pretty well.

1045
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:11,280
Oh, no, Greg. These doctors
don't care about that stuff.

1046
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,380
If you want to sell a drug like
Sustengo, you have to make it personal.

1047
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,780
Do you know any sexually frustrated

1048
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,420
old dudes with a heart condition?

1049
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,410
I didn't hear you come in.

1050
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,880
What kept you so long?

1051
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,850
I just got a little bit lost.
Everyone asleep?

1052
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,910
Yeah.

1053
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:52,210
We've got the house to ourselves.

1054
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,960
I'm so happy that you
got away from your wife.

1055
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,600
Excuse me?

1056
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,430
She's been very suspicious lately.

1057
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,730
Quick, quick, quick. We only have an hour.

1058
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,840
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1059
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,240
Jack, come on. You've got to play along.

1060
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,250
Roz Focker said we have to have
an affair with each other.

1061
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,980
I'm role playing.

1062
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,240
Right, right, right. I understand.

1063
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,080
I just have a bit of a headache,
sweetheart, tonight.

1064
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,660
I know. You've had that worried
look on your face all day.

1065
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,520
I promise you, the Focker family
is going to be fine.

1066
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,290
Now, come on.

1067
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,560
Before my husband comes home.

1068
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:38,730
Then, we'd better hurry, my illicit lover.
Let me just brush my teeth.

1069
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,100
Ooh.

1070
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,780
Your father-in-law did not really
put you in a lie detector machine.

1071
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,440
No, that's true.

1072
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,540
That's incredible!

1073
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,190
Jesus Christ, I thought
my wife's father was bad.

1074
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,320
That was a great speech, nurse.

1075
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,920
Thank you.

1076
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,020
And hey, "I'm staring at you."

1077
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,960
It was "I'm watching you," but that's
what he did, yes. Thank you.

1078
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,230
You killed it tonight.

1079
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,230
Those stories about your
family were hilarious.

1080
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,170
Thank you. So, I should be getting going.

1081
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,930
Wait, wait, wait, wait. You're my fiancé.

1082
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,530
Hey, gorgeous.

1083
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,140
Hello, Dr. Ballard. So nice to see you.

1084
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:24,740
Hey, can I get you 200 cc's
of anything you want, stat?

1085
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:28,880
Only if you can buy a drink
for my fiancé as well.

1086
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,450
Didn't know you were engaged.

1087
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,680
Can you take a picture
for us for my scrapbook?

1088
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,520
You know what? You don't...
He doesn't have to do that.

1089
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,620
Yeah, it's for our scrapbook.

1090
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,690
No, you know what, bro?
I'm cool like that. I'll do that.

1091
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,290
You are such a doll.

1092
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:41,660
Here we go.

1093
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,670
One, two, three. Whoa!

1094
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:45,860
Best picture ever.

1095
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,000
You look great and you
have, like, a red-eye problem.

1096
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,400
I'll see you later, babe.

1097
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,710
I cannot believe I ever slept with that guy.

1098
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:53,940
Yeah, right.

1099
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,240
No, seriously, I did.

1100
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,740
At a convention in Milwaukee last summer.

1101
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,150
We were, like, drinking
tequila, doing rum chasers.

1102
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:03,450
Always a bad idea, right?

1103
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,550
Yeah.

1104
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,720
Can you get me a margarita
on the rocks, no salt?

1105
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,730
- You know what...
- I'm going to run to the restroom.

1106
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,820
Gosh. You know what...

1107
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,890
All right, cool. You're the best.

1108
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,130
- All right? All right.
- All right, okay.

1109
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:19,100
Hi. Can I get a club soda and a
margarita on the rocks with no salt?

1110
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:20,630
Thanks.

1111
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,340
Night out on the town, Focker?

1112
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,270
- Dr. Bob.
- Hey, man!

1113
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,330
What are you doing here?

1114
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,470
I'm here for the convention. What about you?

1115
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,910
Doing some work for Pfosten
as a medical expert.

1116
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,070
But you're a nurse.

1117
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,620
You know what? I don't really
have anything to say to you.

1118
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:41,920
Okay, I get it, Greg. I screwed up.

1119
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,930
But the pressure of being in that
family finally got to me.

1120
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,060
What are you talking about?
You were his golden boy.

1121
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,790
More like his golden bitch.

1122
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,830
He wanted Deb and me to get
married in Oyster Bay. Done.

1123
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,200
Can we name our baby after him?
"You got it, Jack."

1124
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,910
And he gives me this whole spiel, right,

1125
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,240
about how I'm next in line to his throne.

1126
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,770
He came up with this name
for me, the Bobfather.

1127
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,180
Really? He said that to you?

1128
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,080
He pulled the same shit on you, didn't he?

1129
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,330
In that family, we're all just hamsters
on Jack Byrnes' little wheel.

1130
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,300
His Circus of Trust,
or whatever he calls it.

1131
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,160
Circle of Trust.

1132
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,500
I had no idea how deep I was in
until I stepped away.

1133
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:24,560
And I'll tell you something,

1134
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,570
once I got off the treadmill,
I've never been happier.

1135
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,270
Yeah, well, I think I got it under control.

1136
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,180
Hello, Greg.

1137
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,950
Hey.

1138
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,990
Hey, Jack.

1139
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,690
You mind explaining this?

1140
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:55,960
What is that? Oh.

1141
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,560
Sustengo. Yeah, that's... You know.

1142
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,470
These drug companies, they give
me all these free samples.

1143
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,130
Is that it?

1144
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,740
Or do you need to use this

1145
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,940
because you're no longer
sexually attracted to Pam?

1146
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:12,440
You know what, Jack? That's ridiculous.

1147
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,680
Really. You know what?

1148
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,980
I'm not even going to go there with you.
This is...

1149
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,320
Have a good night, all right?
I'm going to go sleep.

1150
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,420
Don't walk away from me, Focker.

1151
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:27,350
Jack, is everything okay down there?

1152
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,030
Everything's fine.

1153
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,040
Okay. All right.
Because you seem to have a little, I mean...

1154
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,470
I know what I have, Greg, and I'm
not concerned about that right now.

1155
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,530
Right now, what I want
from you is the truth.

1156
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,270
Jack, did you take one of those pills?

1157
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,310
Well, I was highly preoccupied

1158
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,440
and Dina wanted to make love,

1159
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,950
and the label clearly states
that it's safe for heart patients.

1160
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,510
Yes, but you need a prescription

1161
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,610
after you've had a thorough examination.

1162
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:54,180
How long have you had that...
The situation for?

1163
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:56,120
Stop avoiding the question.

1164
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,290
I'm not avoiding the question.

1165
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,920
If you've had that
for more than four hours,

1166
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,060
you could bust a capillary and have
serious permanent damage.

1167
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,360
How long have you had it?

1168
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,900
Been a little longer than four hours.

1169
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,100
How long?

1170
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,500
Maybe about five and a half.

1171
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,870
Jack, you got to get to an ER right now

1172
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,710
and get a shot of adrenaline
to counteract that drug.

1173
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,710
You're a nurse. Don't you have
that kind of stuff in the house?

1174
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,940
Yeah, I have an Epi kit,

1175
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,670
but I'm not going to give you
a shot there, okay?

1176
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,220
Focker, there is no way I'm going
to an ER room with this thing.

1177
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,310
Now you need to stick me
and you need to stick me now!

1178
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:22,480
I'm having a dick attack!
Stick me!

1179
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,750
Shh. Just relax. Okay.

1180
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,850
I'll get the needle.

1181
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,090
All right. I need you to drop your pants.

1182
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,770
What kind of sick drug are you
dealing to your patients?

1183
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,810
Jack, I told you,
I took home some samples.

1184
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,570
- All right?
- Maybe read the label

1185
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,410
before you just pick up a drug and eat it.

1186
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,500
Let's just do it.

1187
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,710
I'm going to administer the shot
on the count of three.

1188
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:52,440
Just... All right?

1189
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,620
Okay. Just...

1190
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:57,780
It's...

1191
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,910
Your hands are cold.

1192
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,720
I'm sorry. It's a bit...

1193
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:01,990
Okay.

1194
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,890
One,

1195
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,490
two,

1196
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,230
three.

1197
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,740
Focker!

1198
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,470
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1199
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:21,510
Wait, what's going on? What happened?

1200
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,780
Everything's fine.
Henry had a little nightmare,

1201
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:25,410
but Greg's got him settled down, okay.

1202
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,380
No, no, Jack,
I thought I heard you screaming, too.

1203
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,320
No, you didn't. It was all Henry.

1204
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,650
- Well, let me go check on him...
- Oh, no, no, no.

1205
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,350
- ...and make sure he's okay.
- You guys go to sleep.

1206
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,120
Everything's under control.

1207
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,820
Could you and Dad keep it down, please?

1208
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,200
Here's Sirius Black.
Here's Orange Ninja, okay?

1209
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,410
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1210
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:48,870
- Greg?
- Yeah.

1211
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,400
- How's he doing?
- He's all right.

1212
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,880
You know, he's a little shaken up, but...

1213
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,810
Greg, I was involved in some
covert CIA-sponsored

1214
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,080
mind-altering techniques back in the '70s.

1215
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,810
I'd like a few minutes alone with him

1216
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:03,050
just to erase what he saw from his memory.

1217
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,410
You're not going to erase my son's memory.

1218
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:09,150
Greg, he saw his father inject a needle
into his grandfather's penis.

1219
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:13,030
He already has issues. That's something
he might never recover from.

1220
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,230
- I'll handle it, okay?
- All right?

1221
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,290
Okay, thank you.

1222
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,070
Hey, buddy.

1223
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,970
So, you know how sometimes
you need help when you...

1224
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,800
When you make a wee-wee? Yeah.

1225
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,350
Well, when you get to be Grandpa Jack's age,

1226
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,040
sometimes you need help
making a wee-wee, too.

1227
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,280
So that's what you saw me doing.

1228
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,220
I was helping Grandpa Jack because he's old.

1229
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,790
Well, why did he scream so loud?

1230
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,830
He wasn't screaming. He was celebrating,
he was just so happy.

1231
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:50,200
He was, like, "Oh, Focker. Thanks
for helping me make a wee-wee."

1232
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,960
- He just... He was so happy.
- Right, right?

1233
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,200
Right, Greg.

1234
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,930
- Yeah.
- Understand?

1235
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,710
- I think so.
- Good.

1236
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,840
Don't think this incident
is distracting me, Focker.

1237
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,720
I know you're up to something
and I'm watching you.

1238
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:11,580
Well, guess what? I have eyes, too.

1239
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:16,250
So, I'll be watching you, watching me.

1240
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,260
- Okay.
- All right?

1241
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,560
- Fair enough.
- Good.

1242
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,060
So we just watch each other, all right?

1243
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:22,500
Okay, okay.

1244
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm watching you right now.

1245
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,150
Domsey's Bakery. How can I help you?

1246
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:51,230
Hello, yes, do you still have the
pineapple upside-down cake?

1247
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,130
Yes, we do. Would you like
chocolate or vanilla frosting?

1248
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,020
Neither. I'm only interested in merengue.

1249
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,030
Please give me your access code
and releasing ID.

1250
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:04,130
This is Santa. Releasing ID 7726548.

1251
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,140
I need all-source, derogatory only,

1252
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:09,150
on a person named Andi Garcia.

1253
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,040
Alpha, November, Delta, Indigo...

1254
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,210
Santa, your clearances haven't
been active for 12 years.

1255
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,550
Now, you listen to me, Young Turk.

1256
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,280
I was bugging Ho Chi Minh's sock drawer

1257
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,650
while you were still in diapers,

1258
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,390
so don't tell me about clearances.

1259
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,120
Sir, my hands are tied.

1260
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,790
But, I mean, you could probably just
Google the subject

1261
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,230
and find out everything you need to know.

1262
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,620
Oh.

1263
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,170
Then I'll do that. Santa out.

1264
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,740
Hmm.

1265
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,860
Oh, honey, I can't wait to see
Kevin's timeshare later today, huh?

1266
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,670
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1267
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,870
What you doing?

1268
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,010
Oh, just checking the weather.

1269
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,440
There's a cold front coming in.

1270
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:13,600
Oh, no.

1271
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,700
Oh, yeah.

1272
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:22,880
Thanks.

1273
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:25,880
Greg.

1274
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,030
Hey, how you doing? Sorry, I'm late.

1275
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,220
Hi, honey.

1276
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:32,060
A little emergency at the hospital.

1277
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,460
Kevin was showing us his magnificent estate.

1278
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:35,590
It's really nice.

1279
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,690
So this is where you rough it

1280
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,030
when you're not at the homeless shelter?

1281
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,770
Kind of split time between the two.
Maybe 60%-40% here.

1282
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,810
- Really?
- Now that Greg's finally arrived,

1283
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,740
why don't I take you over to see the meadow?

1284
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,540
Yeah, this is perfect.

1285
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,210
- Oh, this is impressive.
- Wow, nice backyard.

1286
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,690
- Yeah, love it.
- Wow, it is.

1287
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,820
Thank you.

1288
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:01,520
Let's reserve that quadrant
over there, Kevin?

1289
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,120
It's perfect for the three-legged race,

1290
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,530
egg toss, capture-the-flag game.

1291
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,530
Why don't we put up a ring of
bouncy castles right out there

1292
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,500
and we have, like,
a relay race for the kids

1293
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,900
kind of intertwined in between them.

1294
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:14,060
Loving it, Kev-O.

1295
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,160
Kevin, is that a tattoo on your back?

1296
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,400
Oh, yes, it is, Dina.

1297
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,670
It looks really elaborate.
Could we take a look at it?

1298
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,040
- Oh, sure.
- Mom.

1299
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,010
Well, it's a curiosity.

1300
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:26,080
My gosh.

1301
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:28,840
Hmm.

1302
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,350
Wow.

1303
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,350
Is that Pam?

1304
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,790
Yeah, it is.

1305
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,590
You know, after the whole Svetlana episode,

1306
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,860
I went on a little bit of a drunken bender

1307
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,920
and wound up in a tattoo shop in Moscow.

1308
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,800
And I asked the artist to ink me

1309
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:44,270
with the image of the one woman

1310
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:47,030
who's always loved me unconditionally.

1311
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,870
- Pam.
- My grandmother.

1312
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,470
The point being, in my drunken stupor,

1313
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,940
I must have handed him
a photo of Pam instead.

1314
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,180
You carry a picture of Pam in your wallet.

1315
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,380
I do. I carry pictures
of many treasured friends

1316
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:59,680
and loved ones on my travels.

1317
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,850
Got a picture of me?

1318
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,950
Of course I got a picture of you.

1319
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,150
You recognize this mensch right here?

1320
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,450
- Ah. There I am. Kind of.
- There you are, yeah.

1321
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,790
That's... Interesting.

1322
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,690
This is actually a very flattering
portrait of you, Pam-cake.

1323
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,850
- Excuse me.
- Dad.

1324
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:15,260
Prudence? Yes! Hello!

1325
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:16,320
Yeah, hold on, honey. I don't...

1326
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,070
Terrific. Okay, yes, thanks, Pru.

1327
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,670
That was Prudence and she says
if you get to E.H.S. by 3:00,

1328
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,270
she can squeeze you in for an interview.

1329
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,830
- All right, that's great!
- Way to go, Kev-O.

1330
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:28,240
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Good job.

1331
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,710
So great you two could join us.

1332
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:35,950
Really wonderful when grandparents
play an integral role

1333
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,920
in early humans' lives. We love them.

1334
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,580
Early humans do need guidance.

1335
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,950
Is that your role, Jack? To guide them?

1336
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:45,160
Yes, I see myself
as something of a shepherd,

1337
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,960
guiding our family through life's pastures.

1338
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:51,370
Yes, I would say Jack is sort of
an honorary shepherd.

1339
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,560
Kind of a shepherd emeritus, if you will.

1340
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:59,100
Well, when my sheep wander, I use
my prod to keep my flock in line.

1341
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:04,410
Oh, there are a lot of family dynamics
at play here.

1342
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,010
Why don't we begin the interview process?

1343
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:11,990
Okay, Henry, I just want you
to clear your mind

1344
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:16,590
and draw a picture for me of the
first thing that comes to mind

1345
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,560
when you hear the word "family."

1346
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,290
Oh.

1347
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,730
This is just like being at the eye doctor.

1348
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,740
Start at the top and work your way down.

1349
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,630
Why would she give her an eye test?

1350
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,870
It's called a Heisenreich Experiment.

1351
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,530
We used it at the agency to test

1352
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,310
the aptitude of potential recruits.

1353
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:37,710
All the letters are the same,
so it's not really an eye test.

1354
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,450
Very impressive cognition, Samantha.

1355
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,120
E... E...

1356
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,520
E? I need to start over.

1357
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,430
Okay, Henry, let's see what
you've chosen to draw.

1358
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,060
What is it? What did he draw?

1359
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,770
Dad stuck Grandpa Jack in the wee-wee
last night. Because he's old.

1360
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,670
I'm sorry? What did he say?

1361
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:06,040
I didn't hear him.

1362
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,350
Something about Grandpa Jack having a cold.

1363
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,680
So tell me about your parents, Samantha.

1364
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,510
Tell me about your parents, Prudence.

1365
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:18,350
That's my girl.

1366
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,380
Want to tell me about your family?

1367
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,760
My dad is a great guy.

1368
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,050
Thank you, buddy.

1369
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,090
But Grandpa Jack makes him
really, really scared.

1370
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,100
So he acts all crazy when he's with him.

1371
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:32,260
Like he tried to cut the turkey
with Grandpa's big knife

1372
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:37,240
and he slipped and he cut his finger.
And he was like, "Oh, shit!"

1373
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,010
Oh, he's blowing the interview.

1374
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,380
She's setting him up to fail
with these questions.

1375
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:45,710
I mean, Sam's a better tester, anyway, so...

1376
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,450
Well, that's because she takes after...

1377
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,880
Takes after who, Jack?

1378
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:51,290
Let's just say I've done some
research on twins.

1379
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,850
There's a theory that in certain cases,

1380
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,480
one twin gets an extra
chromosome from the father,

1381
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,530
while the other sibling
gets an extra chromosome

1382
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,720
from the mother's side.

1383
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,820
Hmm.

1384
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,030
Sam might be three quarters Byrnes,

1385
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,570
whereas Henry could very well have

1386
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,470
a double dose of Focker in him.

1387
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,270
And what if he does?

1388
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:10,930
My Grandpa Bernie taught me this.
Pull my finger.

1389
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,330
Oh.

1390
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:16,840
Double dose.

1391
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,150
Let's go out to the courtyard
for some free play.

1392
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,860
I mean, what is "free-play test"?

1393
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,260
How well they hang on the monkey bars?

1394
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:28,420
I don't think you get it, Greg.

1395
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,330
You know when prison guards learn the most

1396
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,760
about their inmate population?

1397
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,090
During rec time in the yard.

1398
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:36,230
I'm sure Prudence is
in her office right now

1399
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,930
watching every move these kids make.

1400
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,660
- Dad?
- Yeah.

1401
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,800
Can I please go climb that big rock wall?

1402
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,340
- Yeah, okay.
- Just be careful, buddy, all right?

1403
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,810
All right.

1404
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,340
Do you think he can handle that?

1405
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:48,710
What's the big deal?

1406
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,250
I'm just not sure you've instilled
the physical confidence

1407
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,840
for him to shear a face like that.

1408
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,810
Jack, do me a favor. Just let
go of the reins a little, okay?

1409
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,880
I'll let go, Greg,
when you show me, once and for all,

1410
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,430
that you have what it takes to lead.

1411
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,150
I am in control of my family, all right?

1412
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,990
If I give Henry permission to climb
a wall, he can climb a wall.

1413
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,260
If he says he wants to climb
the Empire State Building

1414
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:10,490
and I say it's okay,

1415
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,130
it's okay, because I'm in charge.

1416
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,260
All right? I'm calling the plays now.

1417
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:17,640
So you just got to step back
and accept the fact that I have got this.

1418
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:18,700
Whoa!

1419
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,610
Oh, he is such a brave boy, isn't he?

1420
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,170
See, it's not so bad.
It's just a slight fracture.

1421
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,620
Okay, thanks.

1422
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,670
Hey, Henry, are you doing all right?

1423
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:32,860
Hey, I came as soon as I heard.

1424
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,050
Prudence told me there was a little
bit of a kerfuffle over at E.H.S.

1425
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:38,100
Oh, that's an understatement.
Thanks to Greg,

1426
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,460
we can wave goodbye
to their educational future.

1427
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:41,590
Jack.

1428
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:42,930
Oh, no, no. Pru's a forgiving soul.

1429
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,270
I think I can patch things up.
In the meantime,

1430
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,770
I got a little something
for Hank the Tank here.

1431
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:51,180
Someone to keep you company until
you're reunited with Arthur.

1432
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,810
- What is that?
- Thanks, Papa Kev.

1433
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,470
Papa Kev?

1434
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:56,710
Yeah, old fraternity nickname.

1435
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:00,220
I told Hank the Tank here he
could call me by that handle.

1436
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,950
You're not Hank the Tank. Nobody
calls him Hank the Tank.

1437
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,350
You want to be Papa Greg?

1438
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:07,480
- No, I am Papa... I'm Greg.
- I'm Greg, his papa.

1439
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,650
So I don't need to be Papa Greg.

1440
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,390
I don't need to put a little
thing in front of it.

1441
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,550
Paging Nurse Focker.

1442
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,260
Pam, we need to talk for a minute.

1443
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:14,720
Oh, okay. Mom?

1444
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,140
Hey, Louis, what's up?

1445
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,370
What up, dawg? Hey, hottie at 2:00.

1446
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,570
There's the superstar!

1447
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,700
Hey, hi, hi.

1448
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,140
- Hey!
- Oh. Hello.

1449
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,740
I have the raddest news ever!

1450
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:29,210
Really? Okay.

1451
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:32,110
So our VP of marketing
heard how well you did

1452
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,150
on your speech last night and guess what?

1453
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,280
What?

1454
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:39,290
He wants us to lead the Pfosten
convention in Maui next month.

1455
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:41,580
Yeah, that sounds great.
Honestly, I'm sorry.

1456
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,850
I'm just a little distracted right now

1457
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:44,090
because my son just broke his arm and...

1458
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,250
Oh, poor baby.

1459
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,460
Yeah, so...

1460
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:47,620
You're a super dad.

1461
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,670
- No, I'm not a super dad.
- It is so cute

1462
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,030
how involved you are with your kids.

1463
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,370
No, no, no, that's just what dads do.
It's not like a super...

1464
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,380
Louis! What are you doing?
Is this the book?

1465
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,910
What is... No, go. Come on.

1466
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:01,950
In the back, right? I got them.

1467
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:04,180
Sorry, it's just...

1468
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,510
Somebody's grumpy.

1469
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,680
I'm going to make this brief, Pam-cake.

1470
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,950
I'm not getting any younger.

1471
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,510
Dad. No, I want to make sure

1472
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:13,520
there's someone around besides me
who you can fully count on.

1473
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,390
I couldn't help but notice
how you and Kevin

1474
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,550
have reconnected these past few days.

1475
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:20,060
He's financially secure.
He's great with the twins.

1476
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,160
Got a heart of gold.

1477
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:23,120
He's a little goofy,
maybe, in his dressing,

1478
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,690
but if that body art is any indication,

1479
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,530
I'd say he's certainly open to the idea.

1480
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:28,660
What idea?

1481
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:32,510
The idea of a simple course correction.

1482
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,070
A course correction.

1483
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,210
Greg, Kevin.

1484
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,780
Come on, grumpy daddy!
Come to Hawaii.

1485
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,050
Okay.

1486
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,750
Okay, grumpy daddy will think about it.

1487
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,020
- Yes!
- Okay, okay.

1488
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,120
Oh! Hey, honey, hi!

1489
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:52,590
Perfect. Pam, this is Andi.
Andi, this is Pam, my wife.

1490
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,090
Hey.

1491
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,260
Hi, it's a... It's a pleasure to meet you.

1492
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,960
It's a pleasure to meet you, too.

1493
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,870
Your husband is a freaking rock star,

1494
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,340
but I'm sure you know how lucky you are.

1495
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:04,310
- Yeah.
- I'm not. She's the rock star.

1496
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,940
She's a rock star mom and just 
full-on, rocking person.

1497
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,200
Oh.

1498
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,680
And I'm just a groupie

1499
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:14,450
trying to, you know, carry her amps.

1500
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:17,020
No, you're... You're... You're the man.

1501
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,190
Everything all right here?

1502
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,180
Yeah, Jack, everything's all right.

1503
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,450
- Pam, do you want to...
- Oh, my God.

1504
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,760
You must be the famous Jack Byrnes.

1505
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:29,630
Wow. I have heard so much about you.

1506
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:32,730
I've heard very little
about you, Miss Garcia.

1507
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,070
But I do admire your
cheerleading photographs.

1508
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:36,910
Henry's doing much better.

1509
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:39,100
We were just singing
an ancient Yanomamo song

1510
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,170
about a brave warrior who falls from a tree

1511
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,540
while hunting for chimpanzee meat.

1512
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,610
He's good. Yeah.

1513
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,570
- Hi.
- Hi.

1514
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:50,120
Andi Garcia. Pfosten Pharmaceuticals.

1515
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,290
And you're Doctor...

1516
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,720
No. He's not a doctor.

1517
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:55,620
Not in the Western sense of the word.

1518
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:58,160
Not in any sense of the word.
You're an investment banker.

1519
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,290
Many hats. Kevin.

1520
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,350
Hi.

1521
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:03,990
Okay, cool.

1522
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:05,700
Well, I'm going to mosey on out of here.

1523
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:08,000
All right.

1524
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,010
Wow, you told me she sold
boner medicine, Greg.

1525
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,170
You didn't tell me she is boner medicine.

1526
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,340
Pam, that's ridiculous.

1527
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:17,640
You also said you wouldn't pick her out
of a lineup, too.

1528
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,180
Wouldn't pick her out of a lineup?

1529
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,580
Greg, that woman is stunning!

1530
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,050
Oh, he's covering, Kevin,

1531
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,090
Because he didn't want
Pam to get suspicious.

1532
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,820
Dad. Did you see the way his carotid artery

1533
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:27,190
throbbed when he looked at her?

1534
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:28,890
- Dad.
- Give me a break, Jack. Come on.

1535
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,330
Now this is what I'm talking about, Pam.

1536
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,360
I'm sorry, but this man cannot be trusted.

1537
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,800
Could you for once in your life
stay out of my marriage?

1538
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,490
Greg, come on, don't get hysterical.

1539
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:38,470
I'm not getting hysterical.
He's getting hysterical.

1540
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,470
Look, it's natural
to get a little tempted.

1541
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,560
Nobody's tempted, nobody's...

1542
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,900
Look, even our dear friend, the Buddha,

1543
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:44,170
had to pass through some sorrow

1544
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,570
on his way to enlightenment.

1545
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,270
Our dear friend, the Buddha?

1546
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:48,970
How's he doing? It's been so long.

1547
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,610
Do you ever listen to yourself?

1548
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,810
I try not to.

1549
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,110
I speak from the heart, off the cuff,
like my man, JC,

1550
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,410
at the Sermon on the Mount.

1551
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:57,480
I think that's what you've
always admired about me.

1552
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,650
Well, I got news for you.
You're not Jesus.

1553
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,390
Well, he may not be Jesus,

1554
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,980
but he's a far better choice for
Pam than you are, Greg.

1555
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,220
Dad!

1556
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,350
- I'm sorry.
- Would you stop

1557
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:07,020
- ...with the course-correction stuff?
- No, that's right...

1558
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,460
- What's the course-correction stuff?
- It's nothing.

1559
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:09,800
I want to hear all about it, Jack.

1560
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:13,270
You're leading this family
onto rocky shoals, Focker,

1561
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:14,600
and as captain of the ship,

1562
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:15,970
I'm steering us away to safety.

1563
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,130
Well, you know what?
You're not a ship's captain, Jack.

1564
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:20,770
We're people. We're not on a boat,
we're in a hospital. Okay?

1565
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,710
We're human beings in a hospital
and you're not the captain.

1566
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,340
Well, I may not be the captain,
Gregory Focker,

1567
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,150
but you're not the Godfocker!

1568
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:32,420
Good. Because I don't want to
be the stupid Godfocker.

1569
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:36,790
I'm the Greg Focker, Jack!
All right? I am Greg Focker!

1570
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:39,350
And by the way, Dr. Bob told me you
offered him the job first.

1571
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,860
Nice to know I was your sloppy seconds.

1572
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:42,330
You spoke to Dr. Bob?

1573
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,030
Yeah, I did, Jack.

1574
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,260
Had beers with him last night.

1575
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:46,330
He's in town for a convention.

1576
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,960
That's it. You're done.

1577
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,370
- You're done, it's over, that's it.
- You know what?

1578
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,000
You can't tell me I'm done
because I already quit.

1579
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:52,370
You're done. I'm getting off the wheel.

1580
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,470
- What wheel?
- The wheel!

1581
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,380
The little hamster wheel
that we're all running up

1582
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,780
to get a little taste
of your little water thingy!

1583
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:58,910
Just, please, approval! Approval!

1584
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,010
What the hell are you doing?

1585
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,640
Please! Give me some of the Jack... Yeah.

1586
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,240
It's like a metaphor for your approval...

1587
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,720
Thank you for clearing that up!

1588
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,350
What are you even doing here, Kevin?

1589
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:07,860
I'm trying to help. Why don't you get on

1590
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,090
your stupid monster yacht

1591
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,680
with your bubble-butt Russian girlfriend

1592
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,750
and do Jell-O shots
off of Deepak Chopra's butt?

1593
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:16,200
Greg, don't drag Deepak
into this. Please, Greg.

1594
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,170
Hey, Dina. Jack had a heart attack two weeks ago.
- Adios, folks!

1595
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:29,800
Going down.

1596
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,870
Hey.

1597
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:32,950
- Hey.
- You okay?

1598
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,310
Yeah.

1599
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:37,410
Need a ride?

1600
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:41,850
Hey, it's Pam. Leave me a message.

1601
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,260
Hey, I'm going to sleep over

1602
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:44,850
at the new house tonight, all right?

1603
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:47,120
I just can't deal with your dad right now.

1604
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,900
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

1605
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:55,340
Yeah, I think I just need to clear
my head. Thanks for the ride.

1606
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:56,430
No problem.

1607
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,010
Why am I the bad guy here? Greg was
the one who was being dishonest.

1608
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,520
Oh, please. All Greg did was
downplay that woman's looks,

1609
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,950
so Pam wouldn't be jealous, and you know it.

1610
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,250
You know you did the same thing

1611
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,590
with that gorgeous double agent in Helsinki

1612
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,750
during the Cold War.

1613
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,090
Oh, you're still bringing up
Aatukka Kokkonen.

1614
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,590
I told you her beauty
was privileged information.

1615
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,320
It was a matter of national security.

1616
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,760
Oh, yes. Like your heart condition?

1617
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:23,930
Listen, Jack.

1618
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,860
Greg cares about his family

1619
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:30,030
just as much as you care
about yours. All right?

1620
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,340
Pam?

1621
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:51,720
Don't be mad. I totally
don't want to harass you.

1622
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,960
You just seemed so sad,
I had to bring you some treats.

1623
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,690
Oh. Wow, thanks.

1624
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,330
Some Chinese food. Little wine.

1625
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:04,900
No offense,

1626
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,940
but does Pam even realize how dope you are?

1627
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:10,210
Oh, yeah, no.
I think she thinks I'm dope.

1628
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,340
It's just, you know,

1629
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:13,880
it just changes when you have kids,

1630
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,850
you know, because everything becomes
focused around them.

1631
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,510
Totally. And I'm sure you're like,

1632
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,750
"Hello! Can I have some fun, too?"

1633
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:23,560
Yeah, no. I mean, it's fun, but
it's just a different kind of fun.

1634
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:24,690
More wine.

1635
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,200
It's not like old single fun,
where you go out.

1636
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:31,070
It's more like wake up in the morning
at 6:00, make the kids breakfast.

1637
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,830
You know, that kind of fun.

1638
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,570
I love it. I mean, they're so cute.

1639
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,230
Like, the other day, Henry came in

1640
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,780
and he had his little top hat on and said,

1641
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,170
"I'm the mayor of the kitchen."

1642
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,840
Oh, he's going to be the mayor?

1643
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:44,280
Just out of nowhere he got this
idea he wanted to be the mayor.

1644
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:45,980
And then he came in and he said,

1645
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:49,350
"And here is a proclamation.
You cannot use the 'frigerator."

1646
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:53,120
And he had a sash on.
I think I have a picture of it.

1647
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:55,920
Yeah. I mean, I'm biased,
but he's very creative.

1648
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:59,050
I'm going to step out for a bit

1649
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,620
and get some milk for the morning.

1650
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,570
Don't, Jack. We both know that's not true.

1651
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,570
I don't know why I still think
I can get anything by you.

1652
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:09,190
Mmm.

1653
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,880
I'm going to find Greg.
I'm going to bring him home.

1654
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,970
You know where he is?

1655
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:15,070
I have an idea.

1656
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:19,840
And for the record, nothing ever
happened with Aatukka Kokkonen.

1657
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:22,440
Aw.

1658
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,490
And this is the play that
she wrote called Tropical Seas.

1659
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,890
They're so cute.

1660
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,260
Yeah. They really are.

1661
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:31,390
That's you!

1662
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,590
Yes. I am an algae-seaweed-type plant.

1663
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:35,860
You know, I got to go home.

1664
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,920
Yeah, I totally get that.

1665
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,600
Andi, Andi, no, no, no.

1666
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,700
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1667
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:45,900
Andi, I think I gave you the wrong idea.
No...

1668
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:14,630
Greg, ever since we tag-teamed
on that enema,

1669
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:15,800
I've wanted you.

1670
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:19,710
It was just an enema. Really, I think
you're idealizing the enema.

1671
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:22,140
Andi, you know what, I think you might
have had a little too much wine.

1672
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:26,410
Wine is fine, papi! I took a few Sustengo.

1673
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,710
You took a Sustengo? Why would you do that?

1674
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,580
That's crazy. I'm going to call a cab.

1675
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:37,790
Can I see more pictures of your kids?

1676
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:42,370
Definitely not. You can't...
You got to put your thing back on.

1677
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:43,800
Don't be a grumpy daddy!

1678
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:45,560
I'm not being a grumpy... You got to...

1679
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:14,190
No, Andi! Andi, give me the phone!

1680
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:15,990
- You want it?
- I do want it.

1681
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:17,230
- Come and get it.
- I want... I...

1682
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,670
Andi, it's not funny.

1683
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,910
Let's go swimming!

1684
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,100
Andi, no, it's not a pool.

1685
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:26,270
Is it heated? Is there a grotto?

1686
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,570
No, no, it's a pit! Andi, don't do this.

1687
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,840
Come on!
Put your clothes back on. All right?

1688
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,080
Andi, no! That's not nice!

1689
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,410
You don't throw people's phones
in pits, okay?

1690
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:36,580
You're mean!

1691
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:38,050
Andi, put the clothes back on! Come on!

1692
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,490
I hate you!

1693
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:43,820
Belly flop!

1694
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,780
You really don't know where Greg is?

1695
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:10,410
Honey, I struck out.

1696
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:13,010
I guess my skills just aren't
what they used to be.

1697
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:14,520
Look who it is. There they are!

1698
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:15,580
Hey, Kevin!

1699
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,560
Kevin. Quite a shindig.

1700
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:19,760
Well, you only turn five once.

1701
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,090
Or twice, in this case.

1702
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:24,190
- Now, I've got a surprise for you, Jack.
- Gustavo?

1703
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,530
Is that who I think it is?

1704
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:28,830
You'd better believe it.

1705
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:30,100
Jinxy!

1706
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:32,010
When I heard about your health
issues last night,

1707
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,870
I knew I had to fly him out here.

1708
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:36,310
Kevin, incredibly thoughtful of you.
Thank you.

1709
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:38,510
How come Daddy's not here?

1710
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:40,740
Is it because I was mean to him?

1711
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:43,690
No, honey, absolutely not, sweetheart.

1712
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,950
It's because Grandpa was mean to him.

1713
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,360
- But he's coming! He's coming.
- He will be here, okay?

1714
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:51,390
So, let's go have some more fun.

1715
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:53,590
All right? Let's go.
Let's go see what else there is.

1716
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,170
Just wait one sec!

1717
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,870
Gay!

1718
01:15:10,710 --> 01:15:11,840
Gay!

1719
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,580
Gay?

1720
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,310
- Dad.
- What's that hole?

1721
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:20,790
Why are you so muddy? Where is everyone?

1722
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:22,160
They're at Kevin's.

1723
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:23,820
The party's over at Kevin's.
I got to get over there.

1724
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:25,860
- The kids' party's at Kevin's?
- I thought you were in Spain.

1725
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:29,020
I was, but I can't miss my
little gazugas turning five.

1726
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,230
How are you?

1727
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,860
Hey! Oh, man. I'm so sorry.

1728
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:36,700
I was so messed up last night.

1729
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:39,870
Who's that?

1730
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,240
That is... Dad, that's Andi Garcia.

1731
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,740
- Oh.
- She's a work colleague of mine.

1732
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:44,180
Oh, hi, Dad!

1733
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,410
Yeah. She took a few too many
prescription pills

1734
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,610
and then she pushed me in the pit.

1735
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:50,020
Total party foul. My bad on that one.

1736
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:51,520
Garcia? Is that Spanish?

1737
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:52,610
Okay, we got to go.

1738
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:53,780
Yeah. My grandparents are from Seville.

1739
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:57,160
Are you kidding? I was just in Seville,
mastering the flamenco!

1740
01:15:57,230 --> 01:15:58,320
- No way!
- Dad.

1741
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,830
- What?
- But I got to show her a few moves.

1742
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,260
Her grandparents are from Seville.

1743
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:02,800
- Dad, no, no! Dad, I got to go!
- Okay.

1744
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,060
Ole!

1745
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,840
Your dad's really good.

1746
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:11,200
The faster you go indicates
an increase in sexual prowess.

1747
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,440
Andi, good luck.

1748
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:19,050
It's a good thing you pulled me away.
I was starting to get a semi.

1749
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,670
- Oh, Dad, please.
- It's involuntary.

1750
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:24,280
It's the parasympathetic nervous
system. Flamenco's very sexual.

1751
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,480
Well, just so you know,
nothing happened with her.

1752
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,360
I know that. We're Fockers.
That's not the way we roll.

1753
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:32,450
But I know something went down
with the family.You okay?

1754
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:36,230
Yeah, just the usual Jack stuff. You okay?

1755
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,460
Your mom was right.
Man-opause. Makes me act like a lunatic.

1756
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:41,440
You know, I get a little nutty.

1757
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:44,570
Grandma Roz! Grandma Roz!

1758
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,700
My God.

1759
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:50,040
There she is! My little scrunchie-munchie.
Let me look at you, baby.

1760
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:53,740
Oh, you look so cute. Do you
mind if we sit down, honey?

1761
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,410
Have a little chat.
Because Grandma's feet hurt.

1762
01:16:56,850 --> 01:17:01,550
So, I hear you're not speaking
to your father.

1763
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:03,250
Is that true?

1764
01:17:03,330 --> 01:17:06,790
Well, let me tell you something
about men, Samantha.

1765
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:12,270
They... They... They're told to
be tough and hard, you know?

1766
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:16,200
But inside, they're quite soft and gooey.

1767
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,210
Kind of like a cannoli.

1768
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,710
A knish? It's not exactly that.

1769
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:26,410
It's more like peanut butter
and jelly inside burnt toast.

1770
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:31,750
And once you know that, you
can cut them a little slack.

1771
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,320
Besides, you'll have plenty of time

1772
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:34,650
to aggravate him in your teens.

1773
01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:35,950
Grandma!

1774
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:38,820
Hi, honey! Look at you, how big you got!

1775
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,360
Hi, sweetheart.

1776
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:43,370
Come here and give me a Focker
sandwich. Okay, I'm the cheese.

1777
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,060
- We're cheese!
- I'm the cheese.

1778
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:47,040
No, I'm the cheese and you're the bread.

1779
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,440
We're sourdough.

1780
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:51,470
Attention! Attention!

1781
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:09,990
Henry and Samantha! Today you are five!

1782
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,760
- This way.
- Okay, thank you.

1783
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:22,960
Dad.

1784
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:24,870
- Yeah.
- You coming?

1785
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,410
Yeah. I just want to practice the dance

1786
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,880
I'm going to surprise your mother with.

1787
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:28,930
Go ahead.

1788
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:30,070
Okay. I'll see you down there.

1789
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:31,240
Gay?

1790
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:34,380
My two cents. The way to deal with Jack,

1791
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:37,150
no matter what he does,
just smother that guy with kisses.

1792
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:38,250
He'll be putty in your hands.

1793
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,310
Good.

1794
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:41,020
- Love, love, love.
- Good, putty, thank you.

1795
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,560
- Oh, Gay.
- Yes.

1796
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:45,390
You look good.

1797
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,490
Thank you.

1798
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:48,960
All right.

1799
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,200
- Can you do me a favor?
- Okay.

1800
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:57,370
Can you just put this leg down
slowly? It's an old sex injury.

1801
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,500
- Like this?
- Yeah.

1802
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:02,600
Oh, my gosh.

1803
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:06,870
This performance is my gift to you!

1804
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:09,050
You are the chosen ones!

1805
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,110
Pam.

1806
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,010
- Pam!
- Greg.

1807
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:16,080
I pronounce this your day!

1808
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,490
Oh, what happened to you?

1809
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,150
Oh, it's... I...

1810
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,330
I'll tell you about it later, okay?

1811
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,420
Look, I'm really sorry about what happened.

1812
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,660
- I just...
- I'm sorry, too.

1813
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:28,230
I let everything get out of
control and I shouldn't have.

1814
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:29,930
It's just... It's just your dad.

1815
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:31,870
- You know, I...
- I know. He's insane.

1816
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,810
Yes. Yes.

1817
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:38,640
Listen to me.
We've got our own thing and it works.

1818
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,880
It does, right?

1819
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:43,220
Yeah, we actually kind of know
what we're doing.

1820
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:44,950
- I love you.
- I love you.

1821
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:51,530
- Hey, Sam!
- Happy birthday.

1822
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,150
Look, I know you don't want to talk to me.

1823
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:54,990
I just want you to know that's okay.

1824
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,930
I love you anyway.

1825
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,020
I know, Daddy.

1826
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:03,300
Dad!

1827
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:04,400
There he is!

1828
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,410
Hey, happy birthday, man!

1829
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,540
Hey, look,
I think you left something at home.

1830
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:11,470
Arthur!

1831
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,350
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Dad.

1832
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,390
It's so beautiful.

1833
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,320
Oh, my God.

1834
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,420
Oh, gosh.

1835
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,270
I'm all right.

1836
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:37,170
Gustavo! Birthday cake! Birthday
cake! Try the birthday cake.

1837
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:39,570
There's 36 different kinds!

1838
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:49,380
Kevin?

1839
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:50,440
Rosalind.

1840
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:54,210
What a mitzvah that you could
make it to the party.

1841
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:56,220
What's wrong, honey?

1842
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,850
I wish I knew.

1843
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:59,330
Come. Sit down.

1844
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:05,600
Look over this way a little bit.
And a little up. Up.

1845
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,240
Hey, Jack.

1846
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:12,070
Wow, that's great.
That's a great likeness.

1847
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:15,130
That's really...

1848
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:18,050
It really captured the intensity
and looks just like you.

1849
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,180
All right.
So, look, last night,

1850
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,310
I think we both said some things we regret.

1851
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:25,450
Maybe I shouldn't have said
anything about Dr. Bob.

1852
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,980
But then you did that whole
course-correction thing. So...

1853
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:32,460
Anyway, "peace" of cake offering.

1854
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,560
What the hell?

1855
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:44,830
Oh, shit.

1856
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,440
Jack, you all right? Jack, I'm sorry.

1857
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:49,140
Jack, you okay?

1858
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,580
Okay, Focker. At least you're going
to make this a little fun.

1859
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,710
Jack. Let's not do this. Come on.

1860
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:01,590
We've had this date
since the beginning, Greg.

1861
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,290
All right. Let's dance.

1862
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:09,390
Come on, man.

1863
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:30,980
Jack?

1864
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,720
Where are you? Jack!

1865
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:46,500
Jack?

1866
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,480
Get out of the ball pit! Get out of
the ball pit! Get out!

1867
01:22:57,850 --> 01:22:58,970
Let's go.

1868
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:00,980
Get out! Get out of the ball pit!

1869
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:02,550
Get out!

1870
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,210
Jack?

1871
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:19,770
I saw you last night with Andi Garcia!

1872
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,030
Nothing happened!

1873
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:25,800
I've been in the wild for so long,

1874
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,340
that maybe it's time to come home.

1875
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,940
But then where is home?

1876
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:31,670
Honey, home is inside of you.

1877
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:35,450
What you have been seeking out
there is right in here.

1878
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:37,680
- In your heart?
- No, in your heart.

1879
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:38,780
In my heart.

1880
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:39,950
Yes, yes, Kevin.

1881
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:58,640
Suck it!

1882
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:06,040
Arthur? Arthur? Mom! Arthur's missing!

1883
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:24,230
Jack! Nothing happened.

1884
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:27,670
What'd you say? Jack, nothing happened.

1885
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:29,330
I'm telling you the truth.

1886
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,670
Oh, shit.

1887
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:37,580
Jinxy! Jinxy! Bad cat! Bad cat!

1888
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:40,040
Jinx! Bad cat!

1889
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,180
Jinx!

1890
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,220
Jinx! Jinx!

1891
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:47,450
Oh, shit.

1892
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:51,160
Kevin, you are a lovely young man

1893
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:55,060
with a number of unusual
fixations and hobbies.

1894
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,120
Thank you.

1895
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,330
I know you're going to find your way.

1896
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,060
Trust me, honey. Because you
have the strength of a lion

1897
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:02,040
and the soul of a poet.

1898
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,040
Roz?

1899
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:11,810
Bernie? What are you doing here?

1900
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,340
What are you doing here?

1901
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:15,540
The guy has issues, honey.

1902
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:18,090
Bernard, I swear this isn't
what it looks like.

1903
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,780
Your wife was comforting me
in a moment of distress

1904
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,880
and my soul just reached out to her.

1905
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,220
Your soul or your tongue?

1906
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,560
No. There was no tongue involved.

1907
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:26,860
There was a little.

1908
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:28,260
Thank you for your honesty.

1909
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:31,270
I thought you were in Spain, honey.
What happened?

1910
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:32,390
What happened?

1911
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:35,200
I went half way around the world
to master the flamenco,

1912
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:37,000
but there was one thing missing,

1913
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:39,210
my dance partner.

1914
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:41,110
Oh, Bernie.

1915
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:42,880
You're my true north.

1916
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:46,080
I know as long as we're together,
I'll never get lost.

1917
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:48,450
Oh, what a beautiful line.

1918
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:50,280
Come here, baby.

1919
01:25:51,190 --> 01:25:54,780
That's beautiful. So raw, this electricity...

1920
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:57,350
Will you get out of here
so I can shtup my wife?

1921
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:58,450
Shtup her? Yeah, sure.

1922
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,690
Jinx!

1923
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:02,560
Grandpa! Grandpa! What's wrong?

1924
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:04,490
Jack?

1925
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:06,400
- Jack.
- Jack.

1926
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:07,490
Jack.

1927
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:09,430
Honey. Greg, do something.

1928
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:11,000
Okay. Having some chest pain? Yeah.

1929
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:12,740
All right. Just relax.
I'm going to check you out.

1930
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:14,280
What's wrong with Grandpa?

1931
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:15,780
He's going to be fine, honey.

1932
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:18,820
Okay, I'm here. Okay.

1933
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,940
Jack, you have your nitro tabs with you?

1934
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:22,880
Greg, he's not responding to my treatment.

1935
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:26,350
Really? To you waving your hands over
him? He's not a Ouija board, Kevin.

1936
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:27,550
Pam? Call 911.

1937
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:28,680
Okay.

1938
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,690
Kevin, can you go up to the house,
see if you have some aspirin?

1939
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:31,780
Aspirin.

1940
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:32,950
It's all right.

1941
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:35,190
Jinx!

1942
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:42,630
Arthur! Wow.

1943
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:44,910
Thanks, Dad.

1944
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:50,300
Just relax, Jack. It's going to be okay.

1945
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:51,850
Breathe, breathe.

1946
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:53,980
I promise.

1947
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,410
Is he taking any other medications?

1948
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,150
Just the 324 milligrams of aspirin

1949
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:03,920
I gave him about 15 minutes ago.

1950
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:06,460
Thank you, nurse. You did good.
We'll take it from here.

1951
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:08,050
By the way, how'd you guys come by

1952
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:09,620
all these bruises and lacerations?

1953
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,890
Oh, it's a long story.

1954
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:14,800
We were in the bouncy castle,
and then he tripped, and...

1955
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:17,570
I get it. My father-in-law tripped

1956
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,300
through a plate glass window
at my wedding last year.

1957
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,240
All right. Let's get him loaded up.

1958
01:27:23,610 --> 01:27:25,270
Don't worry.
We'll take care of your husband.

1959
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,870
We're going to follow behind
you in the car. All right?

1960
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,510
Greg.

1961
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:33,980
I know you were telling the truth
about Andi, Greg.

1962
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,620
- Really?
- Yeah.

1963
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:38,980
The pulse on your carotid
artery remained steady

1964
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,530
as you pleaded your innocence.

1965
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,860
Right, of course.

1966
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,660
- And, Greg.
- Yeah.

1967
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:49,570
It was never going to be Dr. Bob.
It was you.

1968
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,500
It was always you.

1969
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:53,980
You just relax and stay quiet, Mr. Byrnes.

1970
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,670
I'll see you over there. Okay?

1971
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,210
...Focker.

1972
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,980
Why is he cursing at us?

1973
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:00,710
Hey, we are trying to help you, sir.

1974
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:02,380
What? What?

1975
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:06,960
You're the Greg Focker.

1976
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,950
I'm sorry, what?

1977
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:12,930
You're the... You're the Greg Focker.

1978
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:18,100
I'm the Greg Focker.

1979
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:27,010
Okay. Okay.

1980
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,500
Okay.

1981
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,210
Let's get him up.

1982
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:58,540
One more. I need more. I need more.

1983
01:28:58,610 --> 01:28:59,670
One more, one more.

1984
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:00,770
No, I need more.

1985
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,510
- Another present.
- Here.

1986
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:03,870
Best Chistmakkah ever.

1987
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:05,780
This is a very special gift, guys.

1988
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:06,940
One more, cool!

1989
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,020
What is it, Grandpa Bernie?

1990
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:10,750
I've had it with me my entire life.

1991
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:12,910
It's my own original whoopee cushion.

1992
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:14,820
- What does it do?
- Are you kidding me?

1993
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:16,360
Jack, lift up your leg.

1994
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:19,330
Jack, come on.

1995
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:24,760
Disgusting!

1996
01:29:24,830 --> 01:29:26,100
It farts!

1997
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:29,710
Jack, we have to laugh at the
stuff that makes us human, right?

1998
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:31,970
Gas, burps. Picking noses?

1999
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,570
You kids want to pick your nose and
flick your boogers, do it.

2000
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:35,700
Hey, Bernie.

2001
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:37,250
But do it only when it's dry.

2002
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:38,710
Don't do a wet one.
I have something for Jack.

2003
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:39,770
Take that to your room.

2004
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:40,840
It's what makes life, life!

2005
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,510
I know. I know. Here, Jack,

2006
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:45,580
this is a little something
from Bernie and me to you.

2007
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,120
Oh, how thoughtful. Thank you.

2008
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:48,680
It is a very thoughtful gift.

2009
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,750
It was your idea.

2010
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:50,950
I know.

2011
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:52,890
- What's this?
- What is that?

2012
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,520
That is your own personal yarmulke!

2013
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,060
Jack.

2014
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:58,600
One of those little Jewish hats.

2015
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:00,600
Cute.

2016
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:03,040
We know that you're into
that genealogy stuff.

2017
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:05,130
So, when I was nursing you back to health,

2018
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:07,470
I took the opportunity,
when you were taking a nap,

2019
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,270
of snipping a couple of your pubes

2020
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:12,040
and I sent it to one of
those DNA testing sites.

2021
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:13,170
You did what?

2022
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:16,180
We thought it'd be fun to trace
your lineage all the way back.

2023
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:18,280
- Yes.
- And it turns out, Jack T. Byrnes,

2024
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:20,450
that you are one twenty-third Israelite!

2025
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:23,120
Welcome to the tribe, Jack!

2026
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:25,660
While I dispute the findings,
I appreciate the gesture.

2027
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:26,920
Thank you, Bernard, Roz.

2028
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,120
You're welcome, Ya'akov.

2029
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,720
Your Hebrew name. Ya'akov.

2030
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,230
- Ya'akov.
- Ya'akov.

2031
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,430
Two A's.

2032
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,370
Well, listen, Greg, we're in your home

2033
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:37,930
and you're in charge here,
so why don't you lead us in a toast?

2034
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:39,530
Right.

2035
01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:42,080
Honestly, Jack, I have no desire

2036
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:43,200
to try and sound like I am

2037
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,770
in any way in charge of anything
in this house.

2038
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,980
But I do love our family very, very much.

2039
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:53,720
And I'm really happy that we can
all be here together for the weekend.

2040
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:57,680
Then we'll part ways and you guys will
return to your homes

2041
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,350
in your own respective states. Cheers.

2042
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:00,690
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

2043
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:03,890
Actually, sweetheart,
your dad and I have a little...

2044
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:06,160
Gaylord, we're moving to Chicago.

2045
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,370
No, we're serious. We sold Focker Isle.

2046
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,370
We just bought the house two
doors down. Isn't that great?

2047
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,500
- No, that's not great.
- Oh, no, if they're moving here,

2048
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,840
- then we're moving here.
- Good!

2049
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:17,070
We'll live together, one big happy family.

2050
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:18,210
We should discuss this.

2051
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:20,250
No. No. No. Jack,

2052
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,220
nobody's moving because
nobody's moving. Right?

2053
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:24,850
How else are the kids going to
be Fockerized if we don't live here?

2054
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,150
No. Nobody's going to be Fockerized.

2055
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:28,690
- No.
- Why not?

2056
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:34,290
This Google is a wonderful tool,
Jinxy cat.

2057
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:38,820
Don't tell anyone, but I'm going
to do a search on myself.

2058
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:57,950
Come on. Who needs something like this?

2059
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:01,150
Who's the target demo
for a drug like Sustengo?

2060
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:04,090
And I got to say it's somebody
like my father-in-law.

2061
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:07,190
His name is Jack Byrnes. You
know, he had a heart attack

2062
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:10,820
and he called me up, he said, "Greg,
I've had a heart attack."

2063
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:12,130
Now, I said, "First of all, Jack,

2064
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,900
"don't you have to have a heart
to get one of those?"

2065
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:18,270
First weekend I ever met him,
he said to me, he said,

2066
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:23,440
"Hey, listen, keep your snake in its
cage for the next 72 hours."

2067
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:25,140
I didn't say it like that.

2068
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:27,080
All right.
Maybe somebody's had their snake

2069
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:29,740
in their cage for about 30 years! Okay.

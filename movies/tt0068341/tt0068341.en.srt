2
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,404
You're out of bounds, Johnny.

3
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:36,488
Go fetch your ball,
Johnny.

4
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:38,122
Hey, I just got in yesterday.

5
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,253
I didn't expect no brass band
or anything like that,

6
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:53,671
but at least a <i>come va.</i>

7
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:56,299
What makes you think you
got the right, you son of a...

8
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,476
What?
What'd you say?

9
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,067
You act like
this is a morgue.

10
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:09,938
I guess
I'll go talk to Don Vito.

11
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:12,657
What makes you think
he'll talk to you?

12
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,759
<i>...report to the warden 's office.</i>

13
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:43,104
<i>28648, report to</i>
<i>the warden's office.</i>

14
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,066
Hey, everybody out, quick.

15
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:58,513
I'll kill this guinea bastard,
so help me, God.

16
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:06,104
Open up! Open UP!

17
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:10,433
Get me out of here.
I want solitary.

18
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,435
First, you let go
of that man, Valachi.

19
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:15,355
Like hell.
I want a promise of solitary,

20
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:17,398
or this knife goes
right through his neck.

21
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,533
Aah.

22
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,783
Look, I can't stop him
going in the hole if he wants it.

23
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:28,084
Okay.

24
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,204
You got your promise, buddy.

25
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:32,338
Come on, come on!

26
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,314
You don't like our cooking?

27
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:00,074
Maybe you think it's poisoned.

28
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,696
Listen, I want a meeting
with Vito Genovese.

29
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:07,699
If Mr. Genovese
wants to see you,

30
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,325
he'll let you know.

31
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:11,869
All right, then.
I want to talk to a lawyer.

32
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:16,132
Sure, why not?
Tomorrow, after exercise.

33
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,338
You telling me it's easier
to talk to my lawyer

34
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:24,432
than it is to Don Vito?

35
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,145
<i>36849, you have a visitor.</i>

36
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:33,232
<i>36849, you have a visitor.</i>

37
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,394
Valachi, drop that pipe!

38
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:14,232
Valachi! drop that pipe!

39
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:16,859
Valachi!

40
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,982
At least I got Salerto.

41
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:27,320
Joseph Saupp, you mean.
You hit the wrong guy, Valachi.

42
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,697
Saupp's a check forger
from Alabama.

43
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,208
No connection whatsoever
with your people.

44
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,253
I'm telling you,
Salerto tried to kill me.

45
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,048
A dope charge
and now a homicide.

46
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,044
You bulls don't give me protection,
there's gonna be more.

47
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:45,129
You let an animal
talk like that?

48
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,632
No wonder we've got trouble
in our prisons.

49
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:50,551
- Who the hell you calling an animal?
- You got a better word for it?

50
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,471
Father an alcoholic,
two brothers in insane asylums,

51
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:55,640
two others killed
in a gunfight with the police.

52
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,016
Screw you!

53
00:05:57,116 --> 00:05:59,018
I don't need nobody else
climbing on my back,

54
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:01,020
and you leave my family
out of it, you hear me?

55
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,322
I hear.
You got me real scared.

56
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:05,775
Who the hell are you?

57
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:06,901
Ryan, federal board.

58
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:09,070
Oh, big deal.

59
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,780
I seen you someplace?
I know you?

60
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,657
I know you.

61
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:14,075
So, you want to dance?

62
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:16,077
Want to talk.

63
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,745
I ain't a talker.

64
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,338
Like to bet?

65
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,712
Did you hear what happened
to your friend Tony Bender?

66
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:28,881
- Who?
- Tony Bender.

67
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:31,259
He's an underboss of
Vito Genovese, that's who.

68
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,718
He's disappeared.

69
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:34,679
You call lost and found yet?

70
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:37,598
Word is out... rat.

71
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:38,891
<i>Vito, what happened?</i>

72
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,102
<i>Vinny was there at the dockside.</i>

73
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,104
<i>Joe Valachi, Tony Bender.</i>

74
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:44,647
<i>Salerto caught a slug.</i>

75
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:47,191
<i>He was dropped,</i>
<i>but I hear he's doing fine.</i>

76
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,359
<i>The only two that got away</i>

77
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:51,529
<i>were Tony Bender</i>
<i>and Joe Valachi, capisce?</i>

78
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:53,990
<i>They're rats.</i>
<i>An open contract.</i>

79
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,285
<i>No price. Anybody sees them,</i>
<i>they can have them.</i>

80
00:06:57,385 --> 00:07:00,329
Vito Genovese.
Nice voice.

81
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:02,248
Mickey Mouse.

82
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:03,833
Want to hear the punch line?

83
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:07,211
Genovese thinks
you set them up to get busted.

84
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,171
Bullshit.

85
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:11,841
I'm the only guy can
save your life now, Valachi,

86
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:14,969
but I'm gonna want to know
about Genovese, his drug operation.

87
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,313
Why don't you ask
your friend?

88
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,815
He knows a model prisoner
when he sees one.

89
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,568
Okay.

90
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:26,022
Warden, looks like we got ourselves

91
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:28,399
another shortsighted,
mobbed-up punk.

92
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:29,617
I told you.

93
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,362
Take him back to the can
and not solitary anymore.

94
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:35,489
If he meets up with
a knife on the way,

95
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,000
send him a dozen roses
with my compliments.

96
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,376
You want to tell me something?

97
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:48,636
Yeah.

98
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,471
Screw you.

99
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,309
Come on, Valachi.

100
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:13,653
Where you taking me?

101
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:16,706
You been asking enough.
This time he's ready to see you.

102
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:18,824
Genovese?

103
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:20,668
Mr. Genovese.

104
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,515
Mr. Valachi.

105
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,476
Don Vitone.

106
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,908
What did they ask you,
Joseph?

107
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,160
Ah, the usual stuff.

108
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,997
Who do I work for?
Where's Tony Bender?

109
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:08,708
Of course, you didn't talk?

110
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:11,627
How can you ask me that,
Don Vito?

111
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:13,846
May God strike me dead.

112
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:19,143
That Tony, guys like him,
they can't take the time.

113
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:24,190
Between ourself, Joseph,
I think he talked.

114
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,809
What do you mean?

115
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:30,187
What does it matter?
He disappeared.

116
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:32,940
Hell, Tony was a sick guy.

117
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,944
To have to take orders
from a sick guy like that, Joseph,

118
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,330
can be a very bad experience.

119
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,920
So who gives him
the orders, huh?

120
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,914
Listen,

121
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:51,834
Bender promised me
a deal for five years.

122
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,919
I pulled 15.

123
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:55,179
Now...

124
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:57,882
they're gonna give me life.

125
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:59,550
Bender was wrong.

126
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,553
All I know is he tells me
about some narcotics job

127
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:05,181
and suddenly there's cops
all over the place.

128
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:08,067
Vinny's arrested,
Frank's arrested, Salerto.

129
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:12,563
Then I find out you're arrested.

130
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:15,483
I figure, what the hell
is this world coming to?

131
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,152
That's what I'm asking you, Joe.

132
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:20,821
All this time,
I don't know anything.

133
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,448
Nothing.

134
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:25,117
After my 30 days
in quarantine,

135
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:28,370
I enter the population,
and he tries to take me.

136
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,173
I say I gotta see you.

137
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,086
Once I see the right man,

138
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:37,797
maybe I'll know what the hell's
going on around here,

139
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:40,808
and 'cause you're the only one
who could put a stop to them.

140
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,767
Joe...

141
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:47,973
sometimes I have
a barrel of apples...

142
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:50,768
and one of these apples stinks,

143
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:55,314
so it has to be removed,
or it stinks up the rest of the apples.

144
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:56,690
<i>Capisce?</i>

145
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,111
If I've done something wrong,
Don Vito,

146
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:02,822
show it to me
and leave me the pills.

147
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:04,540
I'll take them in front of you.

148
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,253
Who said you did anything wrong?

149
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:48,250
Joe, how many kids you got?

150
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:51,920
One.

151
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,756
How many you got?

152
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,634
Six.

153
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,345
That's a good thing to know.

154
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:07,061
You just made up my mind,
Don Vito Genovese.

155
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,319
$20,000 for Joe Valachi.

156
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,656
Pass the word.

157
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,077
All that for my protection, huh?

158
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:33,671
Hell, no.
It's for mine.

159
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,327
All right, you guys,
keep moving.

160
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,004
Come on,
don't stand around.

161
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,248
Break it up.

162
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:19,083
- Geez...
- You know the rules.

163
00:13:19,183 --> 00:13:22,127
I ain't stood like this
and looked out a window in months.

164
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:25,222
That's very expensive, Valachi.
It'll cost you all you know.

165
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:29,134
For a start, take a look
through these mug shots.

166
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:30,552
What the hell's
the hurry?

167
00:13:30,652 --> 00:13:32,187
I want this over.
The sooner the better.

168
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,149
Place and date of birth.

169
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:43,699
Place and date of birth.

170
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,782
Born in New York.

171
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:54,868
September 22, 1903.

172
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:56,712
School.

173
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,248
I went till the seventh grade.

174
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:01,041
After seventh grade?

175
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:04,670
Hey, what the hell is this,
some who's who kinda bullshit?

176
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,067
I thought we were
gonna get Genovese.

177
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,598
Talk, Valachi.

178
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,853
After the seventh grade,
I worked on a sandboat...

179
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,273
for one of your potato friends.

180
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,311
The O'Brien Brothers.
30 South Street.

181
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:22,396
So far you're batting
a thousand, wop.

182
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,023
You ever finish school?

183
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:25,774
Yeah, didn't you?

184
00:14:25,874 --> 00:14:27,693
Where?

185
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:29,036
Sing Sing.

186
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,527
My name's Tony Bender.

187
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:12,112
That's my bed.

188
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,789
Those are my things.

189
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,075
Be polite.

190
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:18,577
Introduce yourself.

191
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:20,129
My name is Joe Valachi.

192
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:25,250
- You happen to know Joe the Boss?
- Joe the what?

193
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,010
You've never heard
of Joe Masseria?

194
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,649
Don't lie to me, Valachi.
I hate a liar.

195
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:49,950
I never saw him before.

196
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,290
Okay...
The Gap looks after you.

197
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,873
Tony Bender's a strong-arm
for Mr. Maranzano.

198
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:07,751
We gotta be careful
you're not a Masseria man.

199
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:10,921
I don't know what the hell
all this crazy war talk is about.

200
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:14,183
In my gang, the gang I got,
everybody's pals.

201
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,512
Joe the Boss has been
moving in on Maranzano.

202
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,305
A nice pal.

203
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:23,475
Some Mustache Pete
from the old country.

204
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:26,145
Some time I'm gonna tell
you about my outfit.

205
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:28,814
Very big, huh?
You got a lot of men working for you.

206
00:16:28,914 --> 00:16:30,032
Yeah.

207
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,569
I got seven guys.

208
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:34,862
They call us the minutemen

209
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:37,197
because it only takes us
a minute to pull a job,

210
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,659
and it takes the cops two minutes,
maybe more, to show.

211
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,910
And what do you do?

212
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,872
You go out and throw
milk cans at windows?

213
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:47,499
Bender's boss has
400 guys in his gang,

214
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,376
most of them torpedoes.

215
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,337
Now, that Mustache Pete
you were talking about,

216
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:54,381
let's see, he's got 600.

217
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,926
As the paper says,
there's a war on.

218
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,229
Guys from Sicily,
guys from Naples.

219
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,099
Anytime you want to mob up,
ask for The Gap.

220
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,601
Paradise Restaurant.

221
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,770
Times change, Joey, and awful fast.

222
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,356
<i>The Gap was sure right.</i>

223
00:17:11,456 --> 00:17:13,734
<i>Times were changing.</i>

224
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,027
<i>One week out of Sing Sing,</i>

225
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:17,196
<i>I got a tip on a silk factory</i>
<i>in Brooklyn,</i>

226
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:20,115
<i>so I pick up a couple Irish guys</i>
<i>to fill in pan' of my gang</i>

227
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:22,668
<i>that's been arrested,</i>
<i>and away we go.</i>

228
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,747
All right, lady, let's have
your dough and your watch.

229
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,332
What the hell's
the matter with you?

230
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:29,666
I take you
out on a job,

231
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:31,668
and you act like
a couple of kids?

232
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:34,046
Stupid bastard,
son of a bitch!

233
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:36,381
<i>You know, the police had radios?</i>

234
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,559
<i>Cut my time</i>
<i>in less than a minute.</i>

235
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,668
You haven't been out a week
and already in trouble?

236
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,295
- I'm on the run.
- I got eyes.

237
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:57,596
Come on.

238
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,636
What's all this?

239
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,146
I met that guy in Sing Sing.

240
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,481
Who is he?

241
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,433
A friend of Gap's.

242
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,226
Who is he?

243
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:14,646
A friend of Gap's.
They met him in Sing Sing.

244
00:19:14,746 --> 00:19:16,857
Why he's wet?

245
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:19,493
Mr. Maranzano wants
to know why he's wet.

246
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,995
I don't know why he's wet.

247
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,616
Why's he wet, Gap?

248
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:27,417
I don't know.

249
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:32,706
He don't know why he's wet.

250
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:34,007
Oh.

251
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,806
<i>Salute.</i>

252
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:49,064
You gentlemen
are looking for something?

253
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,225
Sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Maranzano,

254
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:55,779
but did you see a man come
in here dripping wet?

255
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,576
He had horns.
Like this?

256
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,504
Nice.

257
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,886
This wet man, what he do?

258
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:29,805
He tried to rob
a silk shop.

259
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,890
We chased him
a couple blocks.

260
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,017
Racked up one
of our cars.

261
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,978
Ditched his in the river
and got away.

262
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:40,899
I sincerely regret I have
not met with such a man.

263
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:42,442
Well, if you do...

264
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,785
What do you think?

265
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:46,204
I give him a job.

266
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,416
Good night, Officer.

267
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,543
Good night, sir.

268
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,005
<i>The first contract I worked on</i>

269
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:06,800
<i>was to hit a guy named</i>
<i>Steve Ferrigno.</i>

270
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,594
<i>He was one of the lieutenants</i>
<i>who worked for Joe the Boss.</i>

271
00:21:09,694 --> 00:21:12,931
<i>Ferrigno? We were onto him</i>
<i>for at least five killings.</i>

272
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:14,599
<i>Bender got me to rent an apartment</i>

273
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:17,936
<i>same place where Ferrigno lived,</i>
<i>on Pelham Parkway.</i>

274
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:20,113
<i>One month 's rent</i>
<i>with a different name.</i>

275
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,508
There's Ferrigno's apartment.

276
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,169
Right across the courtyard.

277
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,504
First floor opposite.
Well, he could...

278
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:47,382
Like I said, I got a tip-off
he moved in there last week.

279
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:48,675
Make some coffee,
will you, Gap?

280
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:52,270
Sure, I'll make coffee,
spaghetti, meatballs, anything.

281
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,323
You expected a little music or what?

282
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,034
You look musical.

283
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,411
You think so, huh?

284
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,906
Oh, uh, Buster,

285
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:14,709
why don't you go take a look
and see if the view's right from there?

286
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,501
That's no problem.

287
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:24,419
Buster from Chicago.

288
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,213
Go easy with him.

289
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:28,340
To date, nine killings.

290
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,383
Oh, yeah?

291
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,552
Still looks musical to me.

292
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:35,138
Okay, Tony, this one's
gonna be easy.

293
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:38,683
Hey, none of my business,
but I rent this apartment.

294
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:42,062
If he shoots him from there,
they trace it to me.

295
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:43,697
Now, everybody's seen me.

296
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,199
The neighbors, the doorman.

297
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,621
Okay.

298
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:55,700
We'll use this place as a stakeout,
and we'll hit him from somewhere else.

299
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,169
Staircase, window,
corridor, anyplace.

300
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,630
So?

301
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,168
Come on, Joe.
You go upstairs,

302
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:07,212
the corridor outside
Ferrigno's apartment.

303
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:09,089
And give us the sign
when they come in.

304
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:11,424
Oh, uh, you got
those pictures?

305
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:12,767
Yeah.

306
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,596
Here's a little homework
to memorize.

307
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,607
Joe Masseria and family.

308
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:27,065
<i>I never knew anybody could</i>
<i>have such an organization.</i>

309
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:29,985
<i>Masseria's outfit</i>
<i>went as far west as Chicago</i>

310
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:31,903
<i>with Capone.</i>

311
00:23:32,003 --> 00:23:33,280
<i>And how in hell</i>

312
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,992
<i>Maranzano ever expected</i>
<i>to destroy Joe the Boss,</i>

313
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:38,627
<i>that was beyond me.</i>

314
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,255
Hold it!

315
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,606
What floor
you want?

316
00:24:07,706 --> 00:24:09,366
Punch yours.

317
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,525
Holy smokes, holy smokes,
guess what.

318
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,575
What's wrong?

319
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:56,321
I just saw that guy Masseria
and these other two.

320
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,123
These other two.

321
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,954
Luciano and Genovese.
Oh, it's not possible.

322
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:05,830
- Yeah.
- No, impossible.

323
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,124
- They got on the elevator with me.
- No, impossible.

324
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:09,793
I pretended I was going
to the third floor.

325
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:11,002
They went up to the sixth.

326
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:13,004
Come and take a look.

327
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:14,723
They pretended
to go to the sixth.

328
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,842
Full house.

329
00:25:17,942 --> 00:25:19,469
Must be having a meet.

330
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:21,388
Easy aces. What the hell?

331
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:23,848
Why don't we cross over that side
and take Ferrigno in the back?

332
00:25:23,948 --> 00:25:28,520
Hey, Mr. Bender, if you ask me,
why don't you take 'em all?

333
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,522
You and I can
hit 'em from the top.

334
00:25:30,622 --> 00:25:32,607
And, Gap, you can take them
from the downstairs.

335
00:25:32,707 --> 00:25:34,484
But they're all up there
in that one room.

336
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:36,745
All you have to do
is spray the place.

337
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,407
You want to be the boss?

338
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,535
Okay, I make a call
to Mr. Maranzano.

339
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:45,578
Keep him quiet, Gap.

340
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:47,789
I'm getting restless.

341
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:49,207
Boy!

342
00:25:49,307 --> 00:25:50,967
you ought to think it over,
Mr. Bender.

343
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,845
You're only the wheel man, capisce?

344
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:05,015
When I give the word,
you bring the Packard out to the front.

345
00:26:05,115 --> 00:26:08,485
Until then, I don't want to hear
another word outta you.

346
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:10,737
Please.

347
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,459
Okay, Joe.

348
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,382
Have the engine running,
doors open.

349
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,067
Hold it a minute.

350
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,613
You run up and tell the boss
the coast is clear.

351
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,638
Boy!

352
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:27,806
Whew!

353
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:28,877
What's the matter?

354
00:27:28,977 --> 00:27:30,525
Uh, nothing.

355
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,603
Something's
bothering this guy.

356
00:27:33,703 --> 00:27:35,105
Why do you talk?

357
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:37,565
Let him drive, Tony, huh?

358
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:40,568
I want to know why
he said "boy" like that.

359
00:27:40,668 --> 00:27:43,404
Joey, why do you
say "boy" like that?

360
00:27:43,504 --> 00:27:45,490
Because we really
had a chance to hit.

361
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,242
Hit everybody!

362
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:49,994
Luciano, Genovese,
Joe the Boss!

363
00:27:50,094 --> 00:27:52,547
What the hell is wrong
with you, Bender, eh?

364
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:57,919
Only the new guy,
he has the thought.

365
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:00,046
Why you didn't listen?

366
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:03,007
You said hit Ferrigno,
so we hit Ferrigno.

367
00:28:03,107 --> 00:28:04,434
I believe in <i>iniziativa.</i>

368
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,305
- "Initiative."
- Initiative..

369
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:11,182
What organization,
it means anything

370
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:13,818
without its people
have initiative, eh?

371
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,316
Valachi,
he's a good driver?

372
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,818
Of course he is.

373
00:28:21,918 --> 00:28:23,570
You said get the best.

374
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,572
I get the best.

375
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:27,490
You got a suit and tie?

376
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,242
Sure, Mr. Maranzano.

377
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:32,162
Go away.
Come back two hours.

378
00:28:32,262 --> 00:28:34,255
- Yes, sir.
- Hey!

379
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,959
I swear by this man
Tony Bender.

380
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:39,761
You understand?

381
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,881
He was right to do
the wrong thing.

382
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:46,059
He was thinking what's good
for the organization...

383
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,646
but you were
a little more right, eh?

384
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:54,142
From this day on, Joe Valachi,

385
00:28:54,242 --> 00:28:57,520
you live by the knife and the gun.

386
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,448
You die by the knife and the gun.

387
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,952
Throw a finger from one to five.

388
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,082
Well, Joe,

389
00:29:18,182 --> 00:29:21,552
Gaetano Reina,
he's now your goombah.

390
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:25,098
He is responsible for you.

391
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,309
You have a problem,
you see him.

392
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:34,140
With what finger you shoot?

393
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,441
Give me your hand.

394
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,200
With the spilling of the blood,
Joe Valachi,

395
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,544
we are now one family.

396
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,507
Now, repeat after me
in the language of our fathers

397
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:09,934
or otherwise in English.

398
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,439
This is the way I will die...

399
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,652
...if I betray the secret
of La Cosa Nostra.

400
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,866
I will burn like
the fires of hell...

401
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,872
...if my tongue speaks
like Judas.

402
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,914
This being a time of war,
I make it short.

403
00:30:40,014 --> 00:30:41,874
Two things the most important
to remember.

404
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:46,838
First, to betray secret of Cosa Nostra
means death without trial.

405
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:51,551
Second, to violate
any member's wife, the same.

406
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:54,437
And never use violence
with anyone in the family.

407
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,681
We help you.

408
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:59,684
Because of this,
now you are family.

409
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:05,356
Your job is to be a personal driver
for my underboss Gaetano Reina.

410
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:08,576
He is a fine man
worthy of respect.

411
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:16,159
We are here together
because Joe Masseria

412
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:18,211
has sentenced us to die.

413
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:23,333
So now, whether from
Castellammare or not,

414
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:26,252
we are all one today.

415
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:30,465
What happened at Pelham Parkway
has got them confused.

416
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:34,218
They don't know how
we discovered their meet,

417
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:38,264
so now we concentrate
to get their main bosses,

418
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:41,317
Luciano, Genovese,
but the most important...

419
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,604
Joe Masseria himself.

420
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:48,232
He say he will make no deal with us.

421
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:51,819
So until we kill him once and for all,

422
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,123
the war, it goes on and on forever.

423
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:02,088
Geez, Bender, you missed one.

424
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:12,673
<i>The same afternoon,</i>
<i>we hit Dino Roselli</i>

425
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:15,635
<i>and Peter "Brown Eyes"Ellioni.</i>

426
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:19,680
<i>Next day, we took, uh, Charlie Ansaldo.</i>

427
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,891
<i>He had a nice car.</i>

428
00:32:21,991 --> 00:32:23,935
<i>It's a shame we had to spoil it.</i>

429
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:26,896
<i>That's Frankie Baretta.</i>
<i>"The Enforcer", they called him.</i>

430
00:32:26,996 --> 00:32:28,398
<i>Nice day's work.</i>

431
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:32,235
<i>Sometimes it was straightforward</i>
<i>and easy, no sweat.</i>

432
00:32:32,335 --> 00:32:35,571
You let Masseria come in
and take over our machines.

433
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,615
Mr. Maranzano won't like that.

434
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:39,200
I didn't want
no trouble.

435
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,702
You know the number
you have to call.

436
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:44,672
We're ready to service
our machines day and night...

437
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,968
unless you want to change
your supplier, huh?

438
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:51,379
Okay, Joe,

439
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,806
put back
the Maranzano stickers.

440
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,390
Like that, my dear friend?
You can sleep better nights.

441
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,642
That right, Charlie?

442
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:08,312
Tell me, who came calling?

443
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:10,690
Who was it left his card?

444
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,899
You don't have to talk.

445
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:16,621
You only have to deny
it was Carlo Torrio.

446
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,372
Pity.

447
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:23,252
Carlo Torrio is a nice boy.

448
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:27,290
<i>Doesn't look so nice there.</i>

449
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,836
<i>And with him, Johnny "Golf Bag" Ponti,</i>

450
00:33:31,936 --> 00:33:34,005
<i>Sam Petrelli.</i>

451
00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:36,549
<i>But these were our boys</i>
<i>who were getting it, also,</i>

452
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:39,268
<i>Johnny Buono, Pete Gianola...</i>

453
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,847
<i>but somehow we managed</i>
<i>business as usual.</i>

454
00:33:42,947 --> 00:33:44,765
<i>Oh, that was big of you.</i>

455
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:48,027
<i>Well, sometimes you guys</i>
<i>gave us a little help yourselves.</i>

456
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,234
Only two cases?

457
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:56,326
That's all.

458
00:33:56,426 --> 00:33:58,404
When do we get
some more?

459
00:33:58,504 --> 00:33:59,622
Next week.

460
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,494
All right, break it up.

461
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:05,620
Screw you, mister.

462
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,331
This son of a bitch did
a hundred bucks' worth of damage.

463
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:10,082
Look here, mister,
break it up!

464
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:11,384
You can see yourself.

465
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,728
Okay, okay.

466
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,723
Clear the road.
Clear the road.

467
00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:27,558
- Clear the road. Go on. Go on.
- Okay, okay.

468
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:29,602
Get 'em running!
Get 'em running!

469
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:30,987
Come on! Come on!

470
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,463
Ninety.

471
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:53,258
47.

472
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:55,094
Come on!

473
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,844
<i>Igor so as I knew every bank in the city.</i>

474
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:08,015
<i>Before, I could do the Bronx</i>
<i>with my eyes closed.</i>

475
00:35:08,115 --> 00:35:11,527
<i>Now, it's like I am very capable</i>
<i>of Wall Street, too.</i>

476
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:16,691
28. 128 napkins, 43 tablecloths.

477
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:19,402
And they say they
served only 73 dinners.

478
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:21,362
Some people ain't honest.

479
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:22,822
Chez Aldo.

480
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:24,865
Second time they gave us
the wrong count.

481
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:26,459
Someday we go beat them
on the head.

482
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:40,673
Hey, hey, hey, can't you see
this is private? Move! Move!

483
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:43,342
Next time, the right count,
understand?

484
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:44,468
Tomorrow when I call you,

485
00:35:44,568 --> 00:35:47,021
have the counted money ready.
Remember.

486
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,639
<i>Very reasonable, Valachi.</i>

487
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:50,141
<i>What are you talking?</i>

488
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:51,976
<i>We were dealing straight,</i>
<i>and they wasn't.</i>

489
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:55,563
<i>I mean, for instance,</i>
<i>take the fish market.</i>

490
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:57,773
<i>This guy Tony, uh...</i>

491
00:35:57,873 --> 00:35:59,400
<i>I forgot his last name.</i>

492
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,485
<i>He paid for protection.</i>

493
00:36:01,585 --> 00:36:04,697
<i>Some of Masseria's honkies</i>
<i>start to lean on him pretty good.</i>

494
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:06,115
<i>He gives us a call...</i>

495
00:36:06,215 --> 00:36:07,617
Pack it up!

496
00:36:07,717 --> 00:36:09,368
<i>...and we deliver.</i>

497
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:12,171
<i>Just like the cavalry</i>
<i>and the Boy Scouts, Valachi.</i>

498
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:16,049
Aah!

499
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,472
<i>Just like the cavalry</i>
<i>and the Boy Scouts.</i>

500
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,896
<i>You know, We hit</i>
<i>nearly 35 of Masseria's men</i>

501
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:30,931
<i>the first couple of months?</i>

502
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:33,025
<i>The Castellammarese War,</i>
<i>they called it...</i>

503
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,105
<i>and Joe the Boss was gonna get</i>
<i>every guy from Castellammare.</i>

504
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:40,191
<i>Any guy who was Sicilian, that is.</i>

505
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,193
<i>Must've been bad for business.</i>

506
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:43,619
<i>It was terrible.</i>

507
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,085
Car!

508
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,145
Aah!

509
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:20,030
<i>Signora! Signora!</i>

510
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:25,152
Come on. Bring him in.
Put him on the couch.

511
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:28,614
My God! Papa!
Papa! Papa!

512
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,416
Put him there.

513
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,830
- Oh, God. Papa.
- Be silent!

514
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,540
Show dignity.

515
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,584
They hit us just when your husband
was gonna open the garage door.

516
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:43,045
You are my husband driver?

517
00:37:43,145 --> 00:37:44,722
You are Joseph Valachi?

518
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,549
Yes, ma'am.

519
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:48,092
Papa.

520
00:37:48,192 --> 00:37:49,969
Remember this, Maria.

521
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:52,146
Always he lived with death.

522
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,775
Always he wait
for this to happen.

523
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,528
I have learned to wait with him.

524
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,055
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

525
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:55,209
We know who do it,
Donna Letizia.

526
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:59,955
Don Salvatore, I have lost him.

527
00:39:00,055 --> 00:39:01,832
Bring him back to me.

528
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:03,375
I cannot
bring back the dead,

529
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,219
only kill the living.

530
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,762
Daughter, my love for
your father was without end.

531
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:16,689
I don't stop until I find...

532
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,952
Too many good men
are dead.

533
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,780
These killings,

534
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,699
very bad...

535
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:18,208
for everything.

536
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:23,797
With all respect for the widow...

537
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,752
we did not seek this war.

538
00:40:28,852 --> 00:40:31,722
Who sent you, Mr. Luciano?

539
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:35,759
Nobody sent him.

540
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:37,928
Is true, Mr. Luciano?

541
00:40:38,028 --> 00:40:39,521
Like he said.

542
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:45,486
Salvatore, we are from
the same country...

543
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,323
and now we've...

544
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:53,786
come to kill each other
far from home.

545
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,948
It's our people who died,

546
00:40:58,048 --> 00:40:59,416
the blood of our blood.

547
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,045
And with the cops on our tail...

548
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,958
it's hurting all the business.

549
00:41:08,058 --> 00:41:12,179
So, even if Joe Masseria
doesn't want to talk about peace...

550
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,974
Mr. Maranzano...

551
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:17,635
we do.

552
00:41:17,735 --> 00:41:20,062
While Joe Masseria live...

553
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:22,940
no peace.

554
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:40,240
Please believe me
when I tell you

555
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,459
I held your husband
in the highest respect.

556
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,337
My condolences.

557
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,214
Hurry!

558
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:10,611
No!

559
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:14,491
They come in peace.

560
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:18,445
Look at that Anastasia.

561
00:42:18,545 --> 00:42:20,864
He wants somebody
to start something.

562
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:22,458
He's nuts.

563
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,498
<i>Charlie Lucky and Genovese</i>
<i>said they came for peace,</i>

564
00:42:29,598 --> 00:42:33,043
<i>and one day at Scarpato's in Coney Island,</i>
<i>they set out to prove it.</i>

565
00:42:33,143 --> 00:42:35,304
How about a game of cards,
Mr. Masseria?

566
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:39,475
Yeah. We play Tresette.

567
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,936
Oh, I have to go
to the john.

568
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:45,305
Vito, there's a deck
in the car.

569
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:46,774
Why don't you
go get it?

570
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:36,365
Don't you think someone
should, uh, call the police?

571
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,735
<i>So that's how</i>
<i>Joe the Boss died.</i>

572
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:41,945
We never knew for sure.

573
00:43:42,045 --> 00:43:44,406
Is that so?

574
00:43:44,506 --> 00:43:46,283
Well, don't expect me
to do no more talking.

575
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:48,202
Anyhow, I'm tired
and I'm gonna get some rest.

576
00:43:48,302 --> 00:43:49,495
- Sit down.
- What the hell...

577
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:51,380
We got a lot more talking to do.

578
00:44:04,852 --> 00:44:06,970
I ain't gonna eat that.

579
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,639
So starve.

580
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:10,599
- I don't eat poison.
- You don't?

581
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:12,734
You taste.

582
00:44:20,379 --> 00:44:22,536
How do I know you ain't eating
only the good part?

583
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:27,541
I want to do
my own cooking, Ryan.

584
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:31,078
Maybe.
If you keep on talking.

585
00:44:31,178 --> 00:44:32,871
And I want a hot plate
and I want a refrigerator,

586
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,048
and like I said,
I'm not talking anymore.

587
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,001
My rules, Valachi.

588
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:41,138
You want to starve here or go back
to where you came, be my guest.

589
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:46,593
What happened after
Masseria's death?

590
00:44:46,693 --> 00:44:49,263
What the hell's that got to do
with Genovese?

591
00:44:49,363 --> 00:44:52,015
- Ryan, I want to get Genovese.
- My rules!

592
00:44:52,115 --> 00:44:53,517
All right.
We got organized.

593
00:44:53,617 --> 00:44:54,818
- Organized?
- Yeah.

594
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:57,855
In the <i>borgates.</i>

595
00:44:57,955 --> 00:44:59,106
Territories.

596
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:01,275
Big deal.
You know Italian.

597
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:02,734
That make you
an honorary wop?

598
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:05,078
One territory for each family.

599
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:07,447
That's right,

600
00:45:07,547 --> 00:45:10,500
and all the families were responsible
to the <i>capo dei capi.</i>

601
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,954
The boss of all the bosses.

602
00:45:14,054 --> 00:45:16,957
And it is with humility

603
00:45:17,057 --> 00:45:20,627
I accept this title.

604
00:45:20,727 --> 00:45:25,465
But as a father,
I'm also obliged to remind you

605
00:45:25,565 --> 00:45:28,886
that all of us here
are in a foreign country,

606
00:45:28,986 --> 00:45:33,932
and if we don't help
each other like brothers,

607
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:35,517
nobody will.

608
00:45:35,617 --> 00:45:37,019
While we were killing,

609
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,022
others outside
were making their moves.

610
00:45:40,122 --> 00:45:42,065
The Irishmen,
they own the politician,

611
00:45:42,165 --> 00:45:44,067
the Jews like Lepke, Shapiro,

612
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:46,695
they tie up the garment center
and the unions,

613
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:48,906
and the Dutchmen,
they beat us at the numbers.

614
00:45:49,006 --> 00:45:50,374
So what we do?

615
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,326
We sit still?

616
00:45:52,426 --> 00:45:54,453
We hit them.
We hit them!

617
00:45:54,553 --> 00:45:59,416
You're right, Anastasia,
but first we prepare ourselves.

618
00:45:59,516 --> 00:46:03,212
From now on,
we divide to form new families.

619
00:46:03,312 --> 00:46:08,008
Each <i>borgata</i>
will have <i>capo,</i> a boss,

620
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:10,260
<i>sotto capo</i>, underboss,

621
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,638
and then comes lieutenant.

622
00:46:12,738 --> 00:46:14,097
Under them...

623
00:46:14,197 --> 00:46:16,099
It's a nice setup,
like an army.

624
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:20,020
Yeah, except their own guy
is on the top.

625
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,523
In each city will be one family.

626
00:46:23,623 --> 00:46:28,028
I already spoke with our friend
John Gianola in St. Louis.

627
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:30,113
Capone will be in.

628
00:46:30,213 --> 00:46:32,532
Sam Garolla in New Orleans,

629
00:46:32,632 --> 00:46:35,160
and Pirelli in Detroit.

630
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,039
Only here, in New York,
will be different.

631
00:46:39,139 --> 00:46:43,260
Because we are so many,
we'll be five families.

632
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:47,681
Charlie Luciano will head one...

633
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,392
Tom Gagliano another...

634
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,846
and the others
will be under Joe Profaci,

635
00:46:54,946 --> 00:46:58,558
Joe Buona, and Vince Mangano.

636
00:46:58,658 --> 00:47:03,397
Think of it that we will provide
service for the public.

637
00:47:03,497 --> 00:47:05,899
Everything what the public wants,

638
00:47:05,999 --> 00:47:08,026
women, the best,

639
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:11,280
to gamble, the horse, the numbers,

640
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,117
everything what the public wants
and we give them a fair deal.

641
00:47:15,217 --> 00:47:16,960
Everything except...

642
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:19,246
<i>la droga.</i>

643
00:47:19,346 --> 00:47:23,166
The drug, it can destroy all,

644
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:25,711
all what progress we make.

645
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:28,588
Sure.
Afterwards, we go and get laid.

646
00:47:28,688 --> 00:47:32,509
And remember, what happened
in the past is finished.

647
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:37,764
If your own brother
was killed in this war,

648
00:47:37,864 --> 00:47:40,851
you don't look to find out
who did it to get even.

649
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:44,071
You do,
you pay with your life.

650
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:50,819
From now,
it's forgive, forget for my family.

651
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:54,081
You soldiers want
to see my <i>sotto capo...</i>

652
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:57,451
you see Tony Bender.

653
00:47:57,551 --> 00:48:00,495
Now I pick for my bodyguard,
The Gap.

654
00:48:00,595 --> 00:48:02,664
There goes my spare time.

655
00:48:02,764 --> 00:48:06,385
And for my driver, I pick Joe Valachi.

656
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:09,713
- Congratulations, Joe.
- Thanks.

657
00:48:09,813 --> 00:48:13,183
- You have question?
- Very good. Very good.

658
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:16,603
Hey, didn't we meet
somewhere before?

659
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:18,597
Vito Genovese.

660
00:48:18,697 --> 00:48:21,475
I don't remember,
but nice to meet you.

661
00:48:21,575 --> 00:48:22,651
Fine.

662
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:26,146
With the help of God,

663
00:48:26,246 --> 00:48:29,649
let us bring success to ourselves

664
00:48:29,749 --> 00:48:32,194
and to this thing of ours,

665
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:34,237
great honor.

666
00:48:34,337 --> 00:48:37,374
Forever, Cosa Nostra!

667
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,174
"From the captured spoils,

668
00:48:54,274 --> 00:48:56,468
he distribute one

669
00:48:56,568 --> 00:48:59,304
to each of the soldier
of the Army."

670
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:02,224
It's from Julius Caesar.

671
00:49:02,324 --> 00:49:05,394
That's the way you learn
the real command.

672
00:49:05,494 --> 00:49:08,480
Everything I learn,
I learn from Caesar.

673
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,906
No kidding?

674
00:49:11,533 --> 00:49:14,653
You remember what Caesar say

675
00:49:14,753 --> 00:49:17,781
when he destroy the tyrant Pharnaces?

676
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:20,450
Oh, can't say I do,
Mr. Maranzano.

677
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,120
Uh, it slips me.

678
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,871
He say,

679
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:28,125
<i>"Veni, vidi, vici."</i>

680
00:49:28,225 --> 00:49:30,877
"I came, I saw,

681
00:49:30,977 --> 00:49:32,879
I conquered."

682
00:49:32,979 --> 00:49:35,465
"I came, I saw,
I conquered."

683
00:49:35,565 --> 00:49:38,969
Oh, that's terrific.
Hmm.

684
00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:42,230
Never know when a line
like that might come in handy.

685
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,349
Do you...
You mean you read

686
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:27,976
all these books,
Mr. Maranzano?

687
00:50:28,076 --> 00:50:30,187
Yes, when I was studying
to be a priest.

688
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:33,482
Oh, yeah. I heard that
someplace, Mr. Maranzano.

689
00:50:33,582 --> 00:50:34,983
What kind of language
is this?

690
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:37,652
Oh, it's Lucretius.
Is in Greek.

691
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:39,529
Greek? You speak Greek?

692
00:50:39,629 --> 00:50:41,573
I speak seven language.

693
00:50:41,673 --> 00:50:43,867
Uh, Mr. Maranzano,
who are all those guys?

694
00:50:43,967 --> 00:50:47,662
Oh, this is Caesar
as the high priest of Jupiter.

695
00:50:47,762 --> 00:50:50,749
This is Caesar
as a Roman counselor.

696
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:55,086
This is Caesar as a dictator
and architect of the Roman empire.

697
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:56,671
Which remind me, boys,

698
00:50:56,771 --> 00:50:58,965
tomorrow I have a meeting
with Genovese and Luciano.

699
00:50:59,065 --> 00:51:00,892
I want you both to be there, huh?

700
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:03,470
In case.

701
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,523
Maybe we don't make arrangement, eh?

702
00:51:07,691 --> 00:51:09,568
They betray their own boss.

703
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:14,606
If you was a boss, you trust them?

704
00:51:14,706 --> 00:51:17,484
Why didn't you break up
the family at the meet?

705
00:51:17,584 --> 00:51:21,571
It would start another war.
I don't know yet who's on their side.

706
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:23,540
But tomorrow, I find out.

707
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:26,868
You no tell anyone, yes?

708
00:51:26,968 --> 00:51:28,078
Good.

709
00:51:28,178 --> 00:51:30,338
I no like guns in my office,
but tomorrow...

710
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:36,628
And tomorrow, Tony Bender,
he pick me up at half past 1:00.

711
00:51:36,728 --> 00:51:39,256
You meet me in the office
a little before 2:00, huh?

712
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:40,348
Yes, sir.

713
00:51:40,448 --> 00:51:42,259
And here, read this book.

714
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:45,345
<i>Roman Civil War in English.</i>

715
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:46,855
- Thanks, Mr. Maranzano.
- Ahem.

716
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:49,808
Ahem. Don't I get a book?

717
00:51:49,908 --> 00:51:52,185
Some men are born to read,
some not.

718
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:53,285
Oh.

719
00:51:53,453 --> 00:51:55,730
You found me out,
Mr. Maranzano.

720
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,325
Some things are hard
to find out, but some not.

721
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,318
Good night.

722
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,571
- Good night.
- Night, Mr. Maranzano.

723
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:05,448
Bet you can get five bucks
for that book, the leather alone.

724
00:52:05,548 --> 00:52:06,908
What the hell's
the matter with you?

725
00:52:07,008 --> 00:52:09,244
It's a present from him.

726
00:52:09,344 --> 00:52:11,871
I don't read so good,
but I'm gonna try.

727
00:52:11,971 --> 00:52:14,791
For him? Tell me all about it
when you finish, please.

728
00:52:14,891 --> 00:52:16,710
You got a cock for a brain.

729
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,928
So I'm a genius.
What can I do?

730
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:25,468
Open up! Open up!
It's the police.

731
00:52:25,568 --> 00:52:27,512
Yeah, yeah.

732
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:29,064
It's about time.

733
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,975
You're late.

734
00:52:32,075 --> 00:52:34,060
<i>Veni, vidi, vici, kiddo.</i>

735
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,395
Jane, Mary-Lou, meet Joe.

736
00:52:35,495 --> 00:52:37,072
- Hi, Joe. Greetings.
- Hi, Joe.

737
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:39,983
Wait, wait, wait!

738
00:52:40,083 --> 00:52:42,277
We're supposed to be
in Maranzano's office at 2:00.

739
00:52:42,377 --> 00:52:44,821
Don't worry.
The meeting's called off.

740
00:52:44,921 --> 00:52:47,032
Mary-Lou,
make breakfast on him.

741
00:52:47,132 --> 00:52:48,658
Boy, am I hungry.

742
00:52:48,758 --> 00:52:50,577
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.

743
00:52:50,677 --> 00:52:52,754
Relax. Tony Bender will tell you.

744
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,884
You better get rid
of that chewing gum.

745
00:53:01,471 --> 00:53:03,715
Lay off, Jane.

746
00:53:03,815 --> 00:53:05,225
Baby, I'm ticklish.

747
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:09,854
Hello, Tony? One second.

748
00:53:14,526 --> 00:53:15,852
Tony? Hi.

749
00:53:15,952 --> 00:53:17,395
<i>The meeting is canceled.</i>

750
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:19,773
<i>Yeah, I'll let you know</i>
<i>when the old man needs you.</i>

751
00:53:19,873 --> 00:53:21,858
<i>- Have a swell time.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

752
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:23,401
- Take it off, Jane.
- Hey, you're right.

753
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:26,913
Me, Jane. You, Tarzan.

754
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:30,709
Hey! Hey!

755
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,795
Okay, Mr. Maranzano.

756
00:53:39,676 --> 00:53:41,544
Salerto...

757
00:53:41,644 --> 00:53:44,089
...remember, you
and the Mad Dog,

758
00:53:44,189 --> 00:53:46,007
you wait at
the drugstore telephone.

759
00:53:46,107 --> 00:53:48,468
I give the order.
You hit, no miss.

760
00:53:48,568 --> 00:53:50,887
Or we go back
on the mattress again, eh?

761
00:53:50,987 --> 00:53:53,098
I hope you don't
decide to call it off.

762
00:53:53,198 --> 00:53:55,900
Genovese's boys
took my brother.

763
00:53:57,277 --> 00:53:59,646
Valachi, The Gap,
they're late.

764
00:53:59,746 --> 00:54:01,147
On their way over.

765
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:03,199
I just got through
talking to them.

766
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:06,569
I don't like they're late.

767
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:08,113
When they come in,
send them in.

768
00:54:08,213 --> 00:54:09,456
Yes, sir.

769
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:12,834
Well, what've we got here?

770
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:18,581
Mad Dog Coll and
Steff Salerto out for a walk?

771
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:20,550
There's a law against that?

772
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,168
Move.

773
00:54:22,268 --> 00:54:23,268
Try me.

774
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:27,799
I'll cover him.

775
00:54:27,899 --> 00:54:29,225
Where's Maranzano?

776
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,313
Sit down.

777
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:36,149
That's what I ask.

778
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,402
What do you want?

779
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:43,740
You got a warrant?
Let me see.

780
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:49,662
You're not cops.

781
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:08,223
Come on!

782
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:11,601
Aah!

783
00:55:20,193 --> 00:55:22,153
I said no guns!
Come on.

784
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:56,688
Help me, Judas.

785
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,316
Make the cross.

786
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:04,988
I no want sins
on my children.

787
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:34,008
So who really
killed Maranzano?

788
00:56:34,108 --> 00:56:37,512
I guess you could say
it was Luciano and Genovese.

789
00:56:37,612 --> 00:56:41,357
They hired the Bugsy Siegel boys
to pose like cops.

790
00:56:41,608 --> 00:56:43,608
Hey...

791
00:56:43,743 --> 00:56:47,647
when those phony cops
stopped Salerto and Mad Dog Coll,

792
00:56:47,747 --> 00:56:51,109
they were on their way to do
the same thing to Luciano and Vito.

793
00:56:51,209 --> 00:56:53,036
Yeah.

794
00:56:55,038 --> 00:56:57,991
A matter of timing,
I guess.

795
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:00,168
We always called him
Lucky Luciano.

796
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,545
Yeah, yeah. Go on.

797
00:57:04,839 --> 00:57:06,466
First, I eat something.

798
00:57:09,886 --> 00:57:13,172
Okay, Valachi, you have
your new toys I promised you.

799
00:57:13,272 --> 00:57:15,925
I'm in a hurry,
so let me remind you,

800
00:57:16,025 --> 00:57:17,844
maybe you're 99% safe.

801
00:57:17,944 --> 00:57:19,178
That doesn't mean
your wife is,

802
00:57:19,278 --> 00:57:20,855
or your kid,
what's his name?

803
00:57:23,024 --> 00:57:24,851
You son of a bitch.

804
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:26,561
Magician, Valachi.

805
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:29,022
You start talking or I'll pull
some more rabbits out of the hat,

806
00:57:29,122 --> 00:57:31,524
like these letters from home maybe.

807
00:57:31,624 --> 00:57:33,234
You hold back letters
from my wife?

808
00:57:33,334 --> 00:57:35,153
Well, it's nice
to know you care.

809
00:57:35,253 --> 00:57:37,205
Do you care about
their safety as well?

810
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:41,826
I want a guarantee
they'll be safe.

811
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:43,503
That's up to you, Valachi.

812
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,966
Now, I was asking you...

813
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:50,843
All right.

814
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:55,348
After Maranzano,
there was no more <i>capo dei capi...</i>

815
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:59,427
just Luciano,
the Mangano boys,

816
00:57:59,527 --> 00:58:02,313
Profaci, Venuto, Calliato.

817
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:08,770
The underbosses
were Genovese, Anastasia,

818
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:11,280
Charlie Calesi,
and the three Franco boys.

819
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:17,320
The lieutenants were
Johnny Gardena, Tony Bender,

820
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,739
Mick Moretti,

821
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,658
and Joe Adonis,
you heard of him.

822
00:58:21,758 --> 00:58:23,292
Good. okay.

823
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:27,163
Now, after Maranzano's murder,
which family did you go with?

824
00:58:27,263 --> 00:58:29,290
What kinda dummy are you?

825
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:31,134
After the murder, I ran.

826
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,196
- Mrs. Reina?
- Yes?

827
00:59:00,296 --> 00:59:01,656
You remember me?
I'm Joe Valachi.

828
00:59:01,756 --> 00:59:02,907
Yes, I know.

829
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:04,951
They shot Mr. Maranzano,

830
00:59:05,051 --> 00:59:06,995
and your husband was
my goombah, so I...

831
00:59:07,095 --> 00:59:09,422
Come on. Come in.

832
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:14,218
Be careful, Mrs. Reina.
These steps are pretty steep.

833
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:25,096
Let me help you, Mrs. Reina.

834
00:59:25,196 --> 00:59:26,481
Yes.

835
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:28,933
Thank you.

836
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:30,476
Hey, this is terrific.

837
00:59:30,576 --> 00:59:32,487
Eh, it will do for the moment.

838
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:38,067
Just until things
quiet down.

839
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:39,277
We will bring you food.

840
00:59:39,377 --> 00:59:40,846
Oh, you don't have to
do that, Mrs. Reina.

841
00:59:40,946 --> 00:59:43,239
I can always sneak out
and get something to eat.

842
00:59:43,339 --> 00:59:45,533
Ah, even the windows have eyes.

843
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:46,659
Hey, yeah.

844
00:59:46,759 --> 00:59:48,336
And Joe Profaci is my brother.

845
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:51,497
Joe Profaci is your brother?

846
00:59:51,597 --> 00:59:53,624
Mmm, and he always eat here.

847
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:55,176
I see what you mean.

848
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,465
Thanks, Mrs. Reina.

849
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:02,016
My husband would do the same.

850
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,394
He was a good man.

851
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:41,214
<i>Those pictures really told</i>
<i>me a lot about Maria.</i>

852
01:00:41,314 --> 01:00:43,800
<i>You know, I never knew a kid</i>
<i>could do all those things.</i>

853
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,426
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>have all those hobbies.</i>

854
01:00:45,526 --> 01:00:48,096
<i>When I was a kid,</i>
<i>I was just Joe Cargo.</i>

855
01:00:48,196 --> 01:00:49,680
<i>- Cargo?</i>
<i>- Yeah,</i>

856
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:53,184
<i>'cause I used to make these</i>
<i>carts out of soap boxes.</i>

857
01:00:53,284 --> 01:00:54,477
<i>"Car go,"get it?</i>

858
01:00:54,577 --> 01:00:56,354
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I hardly knew my father.</i>

859
01:00:56,454 --> 01:00:58,823
Only saw him
when we went on trips.

860
01:01:01,576 --> 01:01:04,112
But I did have a lot
of respect for him.

861
01:01:04,212 --> 01:01:06,781
Oh, me, too.

862
01:01:06,881 --> 01:01:08,708
Everybody had respect
for your father.

863
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:11,911
Even the men that killed him?

864
01:01:12,011 --> 01:01:14,005
Oh, sure, they had respect.

865
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:19,710
You really are a good soldier,
aren't you, Joe?

866
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,254
Yeah, I try to be.

867
01:01:21,354 --> 01:01:23,722
Maybe it's a feeling you don't
understand that I have for these guys.

868
01:01:23,822 --> 01:01:26,134
It's like we're all pieces
of one another.

869
01:01:26,234 --> 01:01:28,094
They make me feel like I belong.

870
01:01:28,194 --> 01:01:29,971
Before now, you might
say I was a nothing.

871
01:01:30,071 --> 01:01:31,071
Oh.

872
01:01:41,157 --> 01:01:42,692
Maria!

873
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:44,535
- Maria.
- Oh, God.

874
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:48,239
Go to your room.

875
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:49,339
Mama, I'm not a child.

876
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,677
Sit. Finish. Sit down.

877
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:08,976
Maria is no toy, Mr. Valachi.

878
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:12,104
I wasn't playing with her,
Mrs. Reina.

879
01:02:18,236 --> 01:02:19,570
Come on.

880
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:23,566
Yes?

881
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:25,026
Good evening,
Mrs. Reina.

882
01:02:25,126 --> 01:02:26,194
I'm looking
for Joe Valachi.

883
01:02:26,294 --> 01:02:27,445
I don't know anybody called...

884
01:02:27,545 --> 01:02:30,948
He's the guy who's been living
in your attic, Mrs. Reina.

885
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:33,367
Mr. Joe Valachi.

886
01:02:33,467 --> 01:02:34,702
What the hell
do you want, Gap?

887
01:02:34,802 --> 01:02:37,121
You, Joey.
Put the gun down.

888
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:39,382
It's okay. You're back
in the driver's seat.

889
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,292
Who says?

890
01:02:41,392 --> 01:02:43,252
Come with me.
I'll show you.

891
01:02:43,352 --> 01:02:44,387
Proof.

892
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:48,382
The proof is I could have shot you
in the back a week ago

893
01:02:48,482 --> 01:02:50,309
being a big man on campus, okay?

894
01:02:52,979 --> 01:02:54,646
Okay.

895
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:55,905
<i>Andiamo.</i>

896
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:10,538
Uh-huh.

897
01:03:12,123 --> 01:03:13,291
No, no.

898
01:03:15,084 --> 01:03:16,084
No.

899
01:03:17,253 --> 01:03:18,253
No.

900
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:22,333
Charlie, this is Joe Valachi.

901
01:03:22,433 --> 01:03:23,793
Ask him what he wants.

902
01:03:23,893 --> 01:03:26,712
- Right now I'd like...
- Uh, we talked it over.

903
01:03:26,812 --> 01:03:28,506
He and The Gap want
to go partners

904
01:03:28,606 --> 01:03:30,883
on the numbers
and the slot machines.

905
01:03:30,983 --> 01:03:32,593
Give him
20 machines.

906
01:03:32,693 --> 01:03:35,396
But for the numbers,
they need the bankroll.

907
01:03:36,314 --> 01:03:38,432
Okay.
Hand them 10 Gs.

908
01:03:38,532 --> 01:03:41,978
Mr. Luciano is giving you
20 machines, his own labels.

909
01:03:42,078 --> 01:03:44,313
That means
no police interference

910
01:03:44,413 --> 01:03:46,023
and the credit for a month.

911
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:48,693
You plant them,
pay us 50%,

912
01:03:48,793 --> 01:03:50,194
and they are yours.

913
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:52,029
Any problem,
talk with Tony Bender.

914
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:53,322
He's your lieutenant.

915
01:03:53,422 --> 01:03:54,657
That's pretty good.

916
01:03:54,757 --> 01:03:56,993
I already got a few places
picked out in East Harlem.

917
01:03:57,093 --> 01:03:58,210
Thanks, Mr...

918
01:03:59,295 --> 01:04:01,080
Mr. Genovese.

919
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,374
- Bye, Charlie.
- Oh, wait a minute.

920
01:04:03,474 --> 01:04:05,584
I got a call from Joe Profaci,

921
01:04:05,684 --> 01:04:08,337
brother of
Gaetano Reina's widow.

922
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:11,465
According to him, Valachi
has been seeing the daughter,

923
01:04:11,565 --> 01:04:13,384
and he's not stated
his intention.

924
01:04:13,484 --> 01:04:14,685
- Can I talk?
- Yeah.

925
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:17,847
I gotta be straight.

926
01:04:17,947 --> 01:04:19,335
I don't know nothing
about my intentions,

927
01:04:19,435 --> 01:04:21,025
but I sure would like
to marry that girl.

928
01:04:21,734 --> 01:04:23,352
Very fine.

929
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:24,895
A nice Italian girl,

930
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:27,356
and the good blood
doesn't go wasted.

931
01:04:27,456 --> 01:04:30,276
Yeah, but the mother,
she thinks I'm a nobody.

932
01:04:30,376 --> 01:04:31,861
Not now, she won't.

933
01:04:31,961 --> 01:04:33,871
Now you're
one of the family.

934
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:52,256
Nice ring.

935
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:53,891
Very nice ring.

936
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:55,851
Paid for?

937
01:04:59,188 --> 01:05:01,640
Yes, Donna Letizia,
paid for.

938
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:04,193
Cash or with the credit?

939
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:06,404
Ahem.

940
01:05:08,114 --> 01:05:09,089
Cash.

941
01:05:09,189 --> 01:05:10,523
Hmm.

942
01:05:10,749 --> 01:05:12,234
I always pay cash.

943
01:05:12,334 --> 01:05:13,944
I got a receipt.

944
01:05:14,044 --> 01:05:15,162
No need, no need.

945
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:43,190
Made by the hands
of my daughter, Maria.

946
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:05,371
My friend and I,

947
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:08,340
withering to the gracious ladies
of this house...

948
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:14,722
To the gracious ladies.

949
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,021
It's time
for me to speak.

950
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:24,890
I speak now for the future,

951
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:26,684
not for the past,

952
01:06:26,784 --> 01:06:29,945
which has sometimes been,
uh, unhappy.

953
01:06:31,113 --> 01:06:34,533
From today, Donna Letizia,
I wish to be your friend...

954
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,611
for friendship is everything.

955
01:06:38,086 --> 01:06:39,086
Friendship...

956
01:06:45,953 --> 01:06:48,539
Friendship is more than beauty,

957
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:50,040
more than talent,

958
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,542
more than government,

959
01:06:51,642 --> 01:06:54,003
more than anything
except the family.

960
01:06:54,103 --> 01:06:56,672
And perhaps, one day,
Donna Letizia,

961
01:06:56,772 --> 01:06:59,842
you and your fine daughter

962
01:06:59,942 --> 01:07:01,469
may have need of friendship,

963
01:07:01,569 --> 01:07:03,596
need of a friend,

964
01:07:03,696 --> 01:07:05,556
a friend rather than a lawyer,

965
01:07:05,656 --> 01:07:07,514
who will lead you in circles
and take your money...

966
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:09,560
or the police,

967
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:13,572
who will end up only by offending
and upsetting you.

968
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:17,818
And if such a day
should come,

969
01:07:17,918 --> 01:07:19,778
I trust that you will turn to me,

970
01:07:19,878 --> 01:07:21,789
a friend of Joseph Valachi...

971
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:24,909
a member of your family,

972
01:07:25,009 --> 01:07:26,952
and the man whose friends

973
01:07:27,052 --> 01:07:30,498
can be counted among
those who have respect,

974
01:07:30,598 --> 01:07:33,751
not only in this city,
in this country,

975
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:35,719
but beyond the seas.

976
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:41,258
Donna Letizia,

977
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:42,726
I await your answer.

978
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,072
Damn it, Mama! Say yes.

979
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,116
Yes.

980
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,612
Mr. Genovese,

981
01:08:01,712 --> 01:08:03,956
you'll never know
today what you just did.

982
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:08,244
I know anytime
you give an order, that's it,

983
01:08:08,344 --> 01:08:10,746
but if ever there's
something special...

984
01:08:10,846 --> 01:08:13,132
Maybe there is
something special.

985
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:17,344
I want you and Gap
to make a hit...

986
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:20,264
a special hit.

987
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:33,561
Ah, there's my ladies.

988
01:08:33,661 --> 01:08:34,820
Ah, you eat now.

989
01:08:36,822 --> 01:08:38,532
Nice, nice.

990
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:44,246
All right, my ladies,
Daddy's going to feed you.

991
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:12,474
Maybe you ought to leave,
Mr. Genovese.

992
01:09:12,574 --> 01:09:14,143
The lights will go down
in two minutes.

993
01:09:14,243 --> 01:09:15,243
Hold them.

994
01:09:27,623 --> 01:09:30,576
Don Vito, we saw the doctor.

995
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:31,668
Ah, did you?

996
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,245
Yeah, it's bad news.

997
01:09:33,345 --> 01:09:35,581
I don't think our friend's
gonna recover.

998
01:09:35,681 --> 01:09:38,959
As a matter of fact,
he's gone already.

999
01:09:39,059 --> 01:09:40,544
Natural causes, I hope.

1000
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:42,179
Oh, yeah,
you might say that.

1001
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:44,548
Shortage of breath.

1002
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:46,016
Sit down, boys.

1003
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:50,521
Vito, I don't think
you ought to stay.

1004
01:09:51,063 --> 01:09:52,640
No lights.

1005
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:55,059
Mmm, relax.

1006
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:56,485
Tonight I want
to see the show.

1007
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:14,203
Uh, you know
her husband?

1008
01:10:14,303 --> 01:10:15,303
No.

1009
01:10:15,637 --> 01:10:17,539
Oh, sure you do, Joey.

1010
01:10:17,639 --> 01:10:19,124
No, I don't.

1011
01:10:19,224 --> 01:10:21,093
The special hit.

1012
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:35,576
I have no long speeches.

1013
01:11:35,676 --> 01:11:39,538
Just want to drink a toast
to Joseph and Maria.

1014
01:11:39,638 --> 01:11:42,624
Happiness, long life,
and male children.

1015
01:11:42,724 --> 01:11:45,052
Thanks. Thanks. <i>Grazie.</i>

1016
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:48,922
Mama, thanks.

1017
01:11:49,022 --> 01:11:51,175
How about some nice gifts, folks, huh?

1018
01:11:51,275 --> 01:11:52,768
To set up this
tremendous couple, huh?

1019
01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:58,190
Thank you.

1020
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:13,539
<i>Salutiamo.</i>

1021
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:16,377
Why'd you do that?

1022
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:24,041
Albert,
what's going on?

1023
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:25,626
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.

1024
01:12:25,726 --> 01:12:27,795
The service is lousy.

1025
01:12:27,895 --> 01:12:29,797
People always bumping into me.

1026
01:12:29,897 --> 01:12:31,757
Behave yourself,
Albert,

1027
01:12:31,857 --> 01:12:33,550
or we won't let you
out at night.

1028
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:35,677
It's just I don't like
people crowding me.

1029
01:12:35,777 --> 01:12:37,229
Mrs. Valachi.

1030
01:12:38,063 --> 01:12:40,307
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1031
01:12:40,407 --> 01:12:42,568
Good luck, Valachi.
Long life to the both of you.

1032
01:12:56,582 --> 01:12:58,534
Like I said, Joe,

1033
01:12:58,634 --> 01:13:01,161
you've showed
you sure got taste.

1034
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:02,871
Thank you, Mr. Luciano.

1035
01:13:02,971 --> 01:13:04,414
Shall we cut
the cake, honey?

1036
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:05,632
Sure. Sure, sure, sure.

1037
01:13:08,844 --> 01:13:10,879
This way, please.
Hold it.

1038
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:12,840
<i>Bene. Bene.</i>

1039
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:16,143
Hey, Joey, you remember
these friends of ours?

1040
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:20,806
Hey, what's the matter with him?

1041
01:13:20,906 --> 01:13:22,474
He didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

1042
01:13:22,574 --> 01:13:23,574
Oh.

1043
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:32,276
<i>So Lucky Luciano became the boss.</i>

1044
01:13:32,376 --> 01:13:35,153
<i>Nah, he appointed a commission,</i>

1045
01:13:35,253 --> 01:13:37,364
<i>a kind of board of directors.</i>

1046
01:13:37,464 --> 01:13:39,992
<i>Was he a good leader?</i>
<i>Better than Maranzano?</i>

1047
01:13:40,092 --> 01:13:42,369
<i>I was doing okay,</i>
<i>so I guess he was good.</i>

1048
01:13:42,469 --> 01:13:43,419
<i>How okay?</i>

1049
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:46,290
<i>I was pulling 2,500</i>
<i>a week on the slots.</i>

1050
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:48,500
<i>Oh, yeah, and this new DA,</i>

1051
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,878
<i>he gets a hold of Luciano</i>
<i>and gives him 30 years</i>

1052
01:13:50,978 --> 01:13:52,588
<i>for running cathouses.</i>

1053
01:13:52,688 --> 01:13:54,339
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

1054
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:57,392
<i>I figure that' was a frame,</i>
<i>'cause Lucky wasn't a pimp.</i>

1055
01:13:58,685 --> 01:14:02,472
<i>So, after Maranzano,</i>
<i>there was Luciano? Then?</i>

1056
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:05,559
<i>Genovese,</i>
<i>but before we knew it...</i>

1057
01:14:05,659 --> 01:14:07,477
I give half an hour, tops.

1058
01:14:07,577 --> 01:14:09,479
The judge is now
getting you the warrant.

1059
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:12,399
Benedetto, could you come here
a moment, please?

1060
01:14:12,499 --> 01:14:14,242
Ciao. Yes, Mr. Hewitt?

1061
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,737
It's official.

1062
01:14:16,837 --> 01:14:18,822
We'll have the court order
in half an hour.

1063
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:21,408
Hewitt. Hewitt.

1064
01:14:21,508 --> 01:14:23,201
It's the only name
I hear these days.

1065
01:14:23,301 --> 01:14:25,329
Hate that son of a bitch.

1066
01:14:25,429 --> 01:14:27,289
I'd like to have one shot,
so help me.

1067
01:14:27,389 --> 01:14:29,302
- I'd nail him myself...
- Donna, do you have my bags?

1068
01:14:29,402 --> 01:14:31,209
- Give me a minute, huh?
- We don't got a minute!

1069
01:14:31,309 --> 01:14:34,046
Calm down, Albert!
Valachi's driving me to the docks.

1070
01:14:34,146 --> 01:14:36,506
Then I'd better bring
the car around now.

1071
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:38,967
What can the son of a bitch
get you for, Vito?

1072
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:40,677
Everything's legitimate.

1073
01:14:40,777 --> 01:14:41,707
Legitimate!

1074
01:14:41,807 --> 01:14:44,222
He figures somebody has
to be minding the store

1075
01:14:44,322 --> 01:14:47,851
now that Charlie Luck is gone,
and he figured me.

1076
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:49,394
You ought to know, Albert,

1077
01:14:49,494 --> 01:14:52,481
even if they nail you
on a technicality,

1078
01:14:52,581 --> 01:14:54,032
they still nail you.

1079
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,326
Tickets.

1080
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:58,453
Tickets!

1081
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:00,906
Where's his tickets, Tony?

1082
01:15:01,006 --> 01:15:03,325
In your coat pocket,
Vito, honey.

1083
01:15:03,425 --> 01:15:06,161
You just sew up the courts
and keep the politicians greased.

1084
01:15:06,261 --> 01:15:07,537
I'm seeing Naples and Marseille.

1085
01:15:07,637 --> 01:15:10,540
When I come back,
we'll have a whole network for drugs.

1086
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,834
I want to walk across that border.

1087
01:15:12,934 --> 01:15:14,378
But we don't need
the drugs, Vito.

1088
01:15:14,478 --> 01:15:16,254
Even Charlie Lucky
taught me.

1089
01:15:16,354 --> 01:15:18,765
Don Vito,
you've got to get out of here.

1090
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:20,684
Albert...

1091
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:24,346
I want a good report.

1092
01:15:24,446 --> 01:15:27,607
You make it nice and easy
when I return. Capisce?

1093
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,686
Darling, anything you want,

1094
01:15:30,786 --> 01:15:32,396
you talk with Albert,
and you will get it.

1095
01:15:32,496 --> 01:15:34,481
Jesus, will you go already?

1096
01:15:34,581 --> 01:15:36,533
All right, all right,
all right.

1097
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:42,948
Good report, huh?

1098
01:15:43,048 --> 01:15:44,491
Come on.

1099
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:47,619
At least I don't have to see
any unemployment in Italy.

1100
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:49,329
My good friend, Benito Mussolini,

1101
01:15:49,429 --> 01:15:51,798
he could talk some sense
into that Roosevelt.

1102
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:56,336
Well, ciao, everybody.

1103
01:15:56,436 --> 01:15:57,929
<i>Ciao, caro.</i>

1104
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:04,720
Well, I guess
that makes me the boss.

1105
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:07,681
But Genovese stayed in Italy
till after the war,

1106
01:16:07,781 --> 01:16:10,609
so the drug thing
didn't get started till '46 or '47.

1107
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:12,819
You tired?

1108
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:16,198
I think I talked too much.

1109
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:19,234
Too much, too much.

1110
01:16:19,334 --> 01:16:21,536
Well, then let me
go on for you.

1111
01:16:24,456 --> 01:16:26,458
In the war,
you were a loan shark.

1112
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:30,412
You muscled in
on one of your customers.

1113
01:16:30,512 --> 01:16:31,663
Guy named Matty,

1114
01:16:31,763 --> 01:16:34,091
ran the Prospect Dress
and Negligee Company.

1115
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,838
They set it up for you
so that, uh,

1116
01:16:39,938 --> 01:16:42,174
Local 25 didn't bother you,

1117
01:16:42,274 --> 01:16:44,351
long as you stayed in the Bronx.

1118
01:16:45,769 --> 01:16:49,765
So now you were
a legitimate businessman.

1119
01:16:49,865 --> 01:16:52,025
You bought into
the old Paradise Restaurant.

1120
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:57,072
Did all your shy-locking there,
peddled all your gas-ration stamps there.

1121
01:16:58,365 --> 01:17:00,317
Big profits.

1122
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:02,410
You bought a new house in Yonkers...

1123
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:05,614
on Shawnee Avenue.

1124
01:17:05,714 --> 01:17:09,409
The house cost 48 grand.
Later on, you added five rooms.

1125
01:17:09,509 --> 01:17:11,369
How much did that cost?

1126
01:17:11,469 --> 01:17:12,996
10 grand.

1127
01:17:13,096 --> 01:17:14,881
The awnings cost 2,500.

1128
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:17,209
Then you went into horse races,

1129
01:17:17,309 --> 01:17:19,511
which is known in the trade
as the big fix.

1130
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:22,380
I never threw a race!

1131
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,882
'Cause that'd be crooked.

1132
01:17:23,982 --> 01:17:25,300
Son of a bitch.

1133
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,929
Your information's so tight,
you go ask anybody.

1134
01:17:29,029 --> 01:17:31,723
My Knight's Duchess was one of
the best horses on the East Coast,

1135
01:17:31,823 --> 01:17:33,475
and I ran her fair!

1136
01:17:33,575 --> 01:17:34,893
Starring Margaret O'Brien.

1137
01:17:34,993 --> 01:17:36,520
Goddamn it, listen.

1138
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:38,563
Salerto came to me
one day with orders

1139
01:17:38,663 --> 01:17:39,940
from Tony Bender
to throw a race.

1140
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,441
You think I listen?

1141
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:43,151
I wouldn't pull that horse!

1142
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:45,737
Knowing you to be the sportsman's
sportsman, I wonder.

1143
01:17:45,837 --> 01:17:47,989
You want to hear
what I said or don't you?

1144
01:17:48,089 --> 01:17:50,083
All right, Valachi, what did you say?

1145
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:53,370
You son of a bitch!

1146
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:55,539
I don't pull a horse
for nobody!

1147
01:17:55,639 --> 01:17:57,833
Joe, you don't lay
a hand on a friend!

1148
01:17:57,933 --> 01:18:00,418
- Those are the rules!
- It ain't rules to throw a race.

1149
01:18:00,518 --> 01:18:02,796
You tell Bender he can go to hell.

1150
01:18:02,896 --> 01:18:04,881
You tell him.

1151
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:07,175
There's gonna be a table, Joey.

1152
01:18:07,275 --> 01:18:08,977
There's gonna be a judgment.

1153
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:15,016
And Anastasia's
gonna be the judge.

1154
01:18:15,116 --> 01:18:17,853
Send those bastards in,
and quick!

1155
01:18:17,953 --> 01:18:21,982
<i>Now, everybody knows</i>
<i>that Anastasia, he's crazy.</i>

1156
01:18:22,082 --> 01:18:25,986
<i>With him, it's always,</i>
<i>"Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

1157
01:18:26,086 --> 01:18:28,196
<i>Hit 'em! Hit 'em!"</i>

1158
01:18:28,296 --> 01:18:30,874
<i>Boy, I didn't think I'd have</i>
<i>a chance at the judgment.</i>

1159
01:18:37,923 --> 01:18:41,626
- The hell's wrong with you, Valachi?
- I'll tell you the way it was. Salerto...

1160
01:18:41,726 --> 01:18:42,961
Shut up!

1161
01:18:43,061 --> 01:18:44,629
You've been in this life
for last 20 years.

1162
01:18:44,729 --> 01:18:46,329
You should know better
than to hit another guy.

1163
01:18:46,429 --> 01:18:48,884
- I know that, but Salerto...
- You don't know shit!

1164
01:18:48,984 --> 01:18:50,468
A rule's a rule.

1165
01:18:50,568 --> 01:18:52,304
Taking a swing
at one of the family.

1166
01:18:52,404 --> 01:18:54,314
He said that Tony
wanted me to fix a race.

1167
01:18:57,776 --> 01:18:59,769
You told Valachi
to go fix himself?

1168
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:01,730
I had 15 grand
on that race, Albert.

1169
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:05,275
For 15 grand, you tell
your own soldier to fix himself?

1170
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:09,446
Well, we all done it for less,
Albert, one time or another.

1171
01:19:09,546 --> 01:19:13,074
Not funny. You are gonna
pay Valachi 15 grand.

1172
01:19:13,174 --> 01:19:15,744
And you owe Salerto an apology.

1173
01:19:15,844 --> 01:19:17,704
Sure. Hey, Salerto, I'm sorry.

1174
01:19:17,804 --> 01:19:20,248
- Ah, it's okay.
- But... But this is a sol...

1175
01:19:20,348 --> 01:19:22,584
Shut up, Tony. Shut up.

1176
01:19:22,684 --> 01:19:23,919
Lucky you're Vito's man.

1177
01:19:24,019 --> 01:19:26,263
I had a lieutenant talk back,
I'd have him hit.

1178
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:28,131
Yes, Albert.

1179
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:29,766
Now out. All of you!

1180
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:35,388
Valachi, come.

1181
01:19:35,488 --> 01:19:36,856
I want to talk to you.

1182
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:39,601
I got a message
from Don Vito.

1183
01:19:39,701 --> 01:19:40,852
Oh, from Italy?

1184
01:19:40,952 --> 01:19:42,070
Mm-hmm.

1185
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:45,148
He's been hearing
rumors about Donna.

1186
01:19:45,248 --> 01:19:47,234
I want you boys
to look after her,

1187
01:19:47,334 --> 01:19:49,160
starting this evening
at the club.

1188
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:53,573
Story is that she's
been screwing around

1189
01:19:53,673 --> 01:19:55,867
and I'd like to see her put away,

1190
01:19:55,967 --> 01:19:58,536
but that's not my business,

1191
01:19:58,636 --> 01:20:01,047
so forget I ever said it.

1192
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:05,635
You understand?

1193
01:20:06,386 --> 01:20:07,512
You understand?

1194
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,798
<i>Nobody ever knew</i>

1195
01:20:09,898 --> 01:20:13,510
<i>why Anastasia was</i>
<i>in such a good mood that day.</i>

1196
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:15,679
<i>But one thing</i>
<i>he was right about, though,</i>

1197
01:20:15,779 --> 01:20:17,973
<i>it was that girl of Genovese's.</i>

1198
01:20:18,073 --> 01:20:19,733
<i>She was trouble.</i>

1199
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:25,988
So?

1200
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:28,066
Good evening, Donna.

1201
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:31,903
I'm an agent for Phil Spitalny
and His All-Girl Orchestra.

1202
01:20:32,003 --> 01:20:34,072
We're looking for a cymbal player.

1203
01:20:34,172 --> 01:20:35,365
Get the hell out.

1204
01:20:35,465 --> 01:20:37,784
Actually,
I'm your new bodyguard,

1205
01:20:37,884 --> 01:20:40,795
and I promised Don Vito
I wouldn't bite off more than I could.

1206
01:20:47,844 --> 01:20:49,596
Jesus Christ.

1207
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,058
I gotta ask you a question.

1208
01:20:54,476 --> 01:20:55,760
How can you do it?

1209
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:57,979
I mean, physically...

1210
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,391
with another dame, huh?

1211
01:21:01,491 --> 01:21:03,485
I follow the bouncing ball.

1212
01:21:04,194 --> 01:21:06,229
Boy, oh, boy.

1213
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:08,189
I'll be out in the car.

1214
01:21:08,289 --> 01:21:09,983
Uh, I mean,

1215
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,776
looking at it my way,

1216
01:21:11,876 --> 01:21:15,447
I can only think of me
in the middle.

1217
01:21:15,547 --> 01:21:16,906
Come back
tomorrow, honey.

1218
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:18,541
We'll put on a show.

1219
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:27,092
Come on, baby snooks.

1220
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:29,552
Get up.

1221
01:21:30,762 --> 01:21:32,339
Say good night
to your snookums.

1222
01:21:32,439 --> 01:21:33,798
Donna...
Get your hands off me!

1223
01:21:33,898 --> 01:21:35,717
Next time, pick on
somebody my own size.

1224
01:21:35,817 --> 01:21:36,843
Call Eddie.

1225
01:21:36,943 --> 01:21:38,928
Tell him to throw
these bums out.

1226
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:40,028
Okay.

1227
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:44,434
Baby, you don't have
to worry about The Gap.

1228
01:21:44,534 --> 01:21:46,561
For one thing, I...

1229
01:21:46,661 --> 01:21:49,773
I wouldn't know how to
explain it to Don Vito.

1230
01:21:49,873 --> 01:21:52,567
For another,
he'd have you killed.

1231
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:54,361
All of a sudden,
the son of a bitch

1232
01:21:54,461 --> 01:21:56,496
sends me
a goddamn watchdog.

1233
01:21:58,206 --> 01:21:59,749
Oh, you know how
it is, honey...

1234
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:02,919
when you have
a bitch in heat.

1235
01:22:11,136 --> 01:22:12,136
Oh!

1236
01:22:12,812 --> 01:22:14,089
Everything okay, folks?

1237
01:22:14,189 --> 01:22:15,515
Sure.

1238
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:19,594
It's all Emily Post,

1239
01:22:19,694 --> 01:22:20,937
you schmuck.

1240
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:24,399
Ain't that right,
little flower?

1241
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,152
That's right.

1242
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,863
Right.

1243
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:32,407
Right.

1244
01:23:11,696 --> 01:23:13,198
Boy, oh, boy.

1245
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:16,359
That all you can say?

1246
01:23:16,459 --> 01:23:17,952
I can say a lot worse.

1247
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:25,493
<i>As far as I was concerned,</i>

1248
01:23:25,593 --> 01:23:27,495
<i>that girl was a black widow,</i>

1249
01:23:27,595 --> 01:23:29,372
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

1250
01:23:29,472 --> 01:23:32,333
<i>Gap became so far gone,</i>
<i>he didn't even care</i>

1251
01:23:32,433 --> 01:23:34,969
<i>whether he was seen</i>
<i>in public with her or not.</i>

1252
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,059
Where's Gap?

1253
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:51,227
Where's Romeo?

1254
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:52,327
Mr. Romeo.

1255
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:00,954
Excuse me.

1256
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:18,004
<i>Everything seemed to be going great.</i>

1257
01:24:18,104 --> 01:24:22,425
<i>Everybody was into</i>
<i>legitimate rackets, politics, unions.</i>

1258
01:24:22,525 --> 01:24:26,179
<i>Anastasia, he was happy</i>
<i>playing the boss.</i>

1259
01:24:26,279 --> 01:24:29,891
<i>None of us ever thought Genovese</i>
<i>would come back from Italy.</i>

1260
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:32,151
<i>But, uh, you guessed.</i>

1261
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:38,992
- Hello, darling.
- Ciao, honey.

1262
01:24:40,702 --> 01:24:42,245
- Go wait in the car.
- Okay.

1263
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:48,960
Hello, Bender.

1264
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:53,373
You look pretty good and fat.

1265
01:24:53,473 --> 01:24:55,875
Trying to look our best
for you, Don Vito.

1266
01:24:55,975 --> 01:24:58,211
What are you doing
with our friends?

1267
01:24:58,311 --> 01:24:59,754
Lots of things.

1268
01:24:59,854 --> 01:25:01,339
Name five.

1269
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:02,799
Well, uh...

1270
01:25:02,899 --> 01:25:04,759
Who do we get to make
drug connections?

1271
01:25:04,859 --> 01:25:05,969
Geez, Don Vito,

1272
01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:08,313
Albert's kind of told us
to lay off drugs.

1273
01:25:10,398 --> 01:25:12,475
- Hello, Valachi.
- Don Vito.

1274
01:25:12,575 --> 01:25:13,525
How's business?

1275
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:15,979
I got a restaurant, some horses.

1276
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:18,906
Ah. How many horses
he got, Tony?

1277
01:25:19,574 --> 01:25:21,234
I don't know.

1278
01:25:21,334 --> 01:25:22,994
You should.
You're his lieutenant.

1279
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:27,407
How about you, Gap?
What have you been up to?

1280
01:25:27,507 --> 01:25:29,751
Oh, you know,
couple of numbers.

1281
01:25:30,877 --> 01:25:33,004
That's what I've been hearing.

1282
01:25:35,965 --> 01:25:38,126
We shall have to lose
a lot of weight around here.

1283
01:25:38,226 --> 01:25:40,178
Don't like it.

1284
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:46,392
A shame Anastasia,
he didn't come to meet me.

1285
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:50,930
All right.

1286
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:52,682
A lot of time to make up,

1287
01:25:52,782 --> 01:25:55,401
but I'm in no hurry,
even if it takes years.

1288
01:25:59,197 --> 01:26:01,074
We got to get back like it was.

1289
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:07,238
You are a good friend of The Gap's,
aren't you, Joe?

1290
01:26:07,338 --> 01:26:08,288
Yeah.

1291
01:26:08,388 --> 01:26:10,033
Know where he is?

1292
01:26:10,133 --> 01:26:11,826
Geez, Don Vito.

1293
01:26:11,926 --> 01:26:14,837
When you see him,
give me a call.

1294
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:17,131
Sure. Sure.

1295
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:22,295
You're involved in this thing,
too, Joseph.

1296
01:26:22,395 --> 01:26:24,305
Get out of here with respect.

1297
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:28,635
I want to hear that you saw him.

1298
01:26:28,735 --> 01:26:30,678
Shall I hit the lights,
Mr. Valachi?

1299
01:26:30,778 --> 01:26:33,806
No, I'll take care of that.
You lock the back door on the way out.

1300
01:26:33,906 --> 01:26:35,900
- Good night, Mr. Valachi.
- Good night.

1301
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:57,337
Joey!

1302
01:26:57,889 --> 01:26:59,132
Joey, please let me in.

1303
01:27:00,216 --> 01:27:01,959
Joey, it's The Gap. Please.

1304
01:27:02,059 --> 01:27:03,544
Please let me in, Joey.

1305
01:27:03,644 --> 01:27:05,138
Joey, please.

1306
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:11,678
You must be crazy.
They got to know you'd come here.

1307
01:27:11,778 --> 01:27:12,778
Lock the door.

1308
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,730
That goddamn broad
told everything.

1309
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:25,950
Yeah. What the hell
did you expect from her?

1310
01:27:27,243 --> 01:27:29,570
Now Vito has an open
contract on you.

1311
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:31,072
I had a shoot-out with Bender.

1312
01:27:31,172 --> 01:27:32,865
Can you believe it?
With Bender!

1313
01:27:32,965 --> 01:27:34,158
Holy hell, Gap. Holy hell...

1314
01:27:34,258 --> 01:27:35,250
Oh, it was crazy.

1315
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:37,161
Like 30 years ago
had never happened.

1316
01:27:37,261 --> 01:27:39,664
You know I'm supposed
to hit you?

1317
01:27:39,764 --> 01:27:41,207
Do me...
Do us a favor.

1318
01:27:41,307 --> 01:27:42,550
Leave the country.

1319
01:27:43,593 --> 01:27:45,586
Right on Pelham Parkway.

1320
01:27:45,686 --> 01:27:47,547
Remember once
when we hit Masseria's boys?

1321
01:27:47,647 --> 01:27:50,883
It's bad for me.
It's bad for my wife and my kid.

1322
01:27:50,983 --> 01:27:52,719
You just can't believe it, Joe.

1323
01:27:52,819 --> 01:27:55,146
Jesus. I get off the L,
and there they are.

1324
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:56,773
Have one from me.

1325
01:28:30,473 --> 01:28:33,676
Hey, goddamn, Tony.
I don't want shooting here.

1326
01:28:33,776 --> 01:28:36,137
You can only help
the guy just so much.

1327
01:28:36,237 --> 01:28:38,105
Then you're out of line.

1328
01:28:52,382 --> 01:28:53,766
Look, Bender,

1329
01:28:54,154 --> 01:28:55,634
we've been together for...

1330
01:28:55,755 --> 01:28:56,755
Christ, how many years?

1331
01:28:56,855 --> 01:28:58,157
20, 30?

1332
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:00,995
At least give me a choice.

1333
01:29:01,095 --> 01:29:04,257
What choice?
Dead is dead.

1334
01:29:05,716 --> 01:29:08,344
The way you're going to hit me.
Want to shoot me?

1335
01:29:09,387 --> 01:29:10,805
Get it over with.

1336
01:29:11,931 --> 01:29:13,724
Oh, shooting's terrific.

1337
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,812
You always loved playing
with guns, eh, Tony?

1338
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:21,974
Not having any friends at all.

1339
01:29:22,074 --> 01:29:24,819
Yeah, I'd just as soon
shoot you, Gap.

1340
01:29:26,737 --> 01:29:29,357
If it were up to me, I'd say,

1341
01:29:29,457 --> 01:29:31,534
"Okay, whatever you want."

1342
01:29:32,785 --> 01:29:36,998
But Don Vito wants a present
for a girlfriend of his.

1343
01:29:57,685 --> 01:29:58,928
Shoot me!

1344
01:29:59,028 --> 01:30:00,813
Come on, Salerto, shoot me!

1345
01:30:03,733 --> 01:30:05,192
No! No!

1346
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:07,569
Cut it off.

1347
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,899
Jesus, no!

1348
01:30:11,999 --> 01:30:13,651
You'd better apologize
to Don Vito.

1349
01:30:13,751 --> 01:30:14,751
No!

1350
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:18,454
No! No!

1351
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:20,999
No!

1352
01:30:59,664 --> 01:31:01,415
You can't leave him like that.

1353
01:31:02,166 --> 01:31:03,501
There's his gun.

1354
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:05,920
Use it.

1355
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:32,738
Jesus Christ, Gap.

1356
01:31:33,948 --> 01:31:36,317
Christ, Gap. I'm gonna
take you to the hospital.

1357
01:31:36,417 --> 01:31:37,526
- Let's go.
- No...

1358
01:31:37,626 --> 01:31:38,694
- Yeah.
- No way.

1359
01:31:38,794 --> 01:31:40,321
- Come on.
- Leave me alone.

1360
01:31:40,421 --> 01:31:41,864
They're gonna fix you up.
Come on.

1361
01:31:41,964 --> 01:31:43,866
The gun.
The gun, please.

1362
01:31:43,966 --> 01:31:46,035
They'll fix you up.
Come on, Gap.

1363
01:31:46,135 --> 01:31:47,536
The gun.

1364
01:31:47,636 --> 01:31:48,879
Joey, the gun.

1365
01:31:49,422 --> 01:31:51,916
Oh, hell, Gap.
I told you about that broad.

1366
01:31:52,016 --> 01:31:55,219
- You should have stayed away.
- Jesus. Anything else?

1367
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:59,390
The gun, please.

1368
01:32:00,808 --> 01:32:01,808
The gun.

1369
01:32:02,435 --> 01:32:06,722
Joey, shoot me, please.

1370
01:32:06,822 --> 01:32:11,352
Oh, God.
Joey, please shoot me.

1371
01:32:11,452 --> 01:32:13,279
Holy hell, Gap.

1372
01:32:14,071 --> 01:32:15,614
- Holy hell.
- Joey.

1373
01:32:16,574 --> 01:32:17,908
Joey, please.

1374
01:32:56,530 --> 01:33:00,034
Ah, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be fine.

1375
01:33:02,244 --> 01:33:05,114
How long has he had the fever?
And what about the doctor?

1376
01:33:05,214 --> 01:33:07,033
He said he'd be back
in the morning.

1377
01:33:07,133 --> 01:33:08,451
I wanna sleep.

1378
01:33:08,551 --> 01:33:10,953
Yeah, that's right.
You sleep, boy.

1379
01:33:11,053 --> 01:33:12,496
Go ahead. Sleep.

1380
01:33:12,596 --> 01:33:15,583
Me and your mommy are
gonna be right here all the time.

1381
01:33:15,683 --> 01:33:18,177
You go ahead and sleep.
I'll leave this here.

1382
01:33:32,358 --> 01:33:34,610
You and the boy
get out of here, go away.

1383
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:37,980
Just for a short time.

1384
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,074
Take the boy
and go someplace.

1385
01:33:40,741 --> 01:33:42,535
It'll be good.

1386
01:33:43,661 --> 01:33:45,996
They're closing in
on you again, Joe?

1387
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,667
You don't tell me I'm wrong.

1388
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:52,912
Jesus.

1389
01:33:53,012 --> 01:33:55,548
I don't know who the hell's side
I'm on anymore.

1390
01:33:56,340 --> 01:33:58,667
It used to be so good...

1391
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,628
the feeling,
everybody working together,

1392
01:34:00,728 --> 01:34:02,296
belonging together.

1393
01:34:02,396 --> 01:34:06,592
Oh, Joe, once and for all,
get out of it.

1394
01:34:06,692 --> 01:34:08,677
Would your mother
ever say that to your father?

1395
01:34:08,777 --> 01:34:10,262
My father was a lieutenant.

1396
01:34:10,362 --> 01:34:11,597
Like you said yourself, Joe,

1397
01:34:11,697 --> 01:34:14,391
things were different
in those days.

1398
01:34:14,491 --> 01:34:15,568
Now...

1399
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:19,855
every time you try to build
something, they take from it,

1400
01:34:19,955 --> 01:34:22,490
some kind of self-respect when somebody's
telling you how to live your life.

1401
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:23,804
I'm not gonna bother
explaining it to you

1402
01:34:23,904 --> 01:34:25,528
because you don't know
anything about it.

1403
01:34:25,628 --> 01:34:27,413
I try not to.

1404
01:34:28,664 --> 01:34:30,491
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

1405
01:34:30,591 --> 01:34:34,578
Joe, there are days you come in
and there are nights...

1406
01:34:34,678 --> 01:34:37,590
I know your hands
have been covered with blood.

1407
01:34:38,716 --> 01:34:41,085
Does Mr. Genovese
or Mr. Bender give you

1408
01:34:41,185 --> 01:34:44,171
some kind of magical power

1409
01:34:44,271 --> 01:34:46,473
so you don't feel anything?

1410
01:34:47,933 --> 01:34:50,511
I never hit nobody that never deserved.

1411
01:34:50,611 --> 01:34:53,013
Honest to God, Maria.

1412
01:34:53,113 --> 01:34:56,308
We only hit the guys
who cheat on the family.

1413
01:34:56,408 --> 01:34:57,601
What do you want me to do?

1414
01:34:57,701 --> 01:34:59,186
Do you want me to say,
"Hey, Vito,

1415
01:34:59,286 --> 01:35:01,564
I'm only going to hit
the following guys"?

1416
01:35:01,664 --> 01:35:03,524
You can't do that.

1417
01:35:03,624 --> 01:35:07,611
You see, if you believe in the family,
then you fight for it.

1418
01:35:07,711 --> 01:35:10,781
It's no different
than being in the Army.

1419
01:35:10,881 --> 01:35:13,334
Then why are they closing in
on you again, Joe?

1420
01:35:15,044 --> 01:35:16,670
Jesus, I don't know.

1421
01:35:17,713 --> 01:35:19,081
You don't?

1422
01:35:19,181 --> 01:35:20,716
Honest, I don't know.

1423
01:35:23,052 --> 01:35:25,629
That's why I want you
to take the boy

1424
01:35:25,729 --> 01:35:28,048
when he's feeling better
and you go to your cousin's.

1425
01:35:28,148 --> 01:35:29,842
And I'll call you after.

1426
01:35:29,942 --> 01:35:31,018
Fine.

1427
01:35:33,229 --> 01:35:34,605
After what, Joe?

1428
01:35:36,315 --> 01:35:37,733
After what?

1429
01:35:39,151 --> 01:35:40,903
After it's over.

1430
01:36:20,859 --> 01:36:21,986
Son of a bitch.

1431
01:36:47,845 --> 01:36:49,296
Now I'm gonna tell you

1432
01:36:49,396 --> 01:36:51,849
why it was necessary
to hit Double-A.

1433
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,720
Before I went away,

1434
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:58,681
we had an organization,

1435
01:36:58,781 --> 01:37:00,599
a structure.

1436
01:37:00,699 --> 01:37:02,935
Everybody had a place.

1437
01:37:03,035 --> 01:37:05,396
Everybody had a position.

1438
01:37:05,496 --> 01:37:08,357
Everybody was responsible
to everybody.

1439
01:37:08,457 --> 01:37:10,985
And when I come back,
I learned that

1440
01:37:11,085 --> 01:37:14,280
nobody knows what
anybody else is doing

1441
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,198
'cause nobody cares.

1442
01:37:16,298 --> 01:37:19,710
And when nobody cares,
that's how people get fat.

1443
01:37:20,294 --> 01:37:21,780
That's anarchy!

1444
01:37:23,964 --> 01:37:25,298
Shh!

1445
01:37:25,891 --> 01:37:28,552
Anastasia commercialized
this thing of ours.

1446
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:30,587
He brought in hundreds

1447
01:37:30,687 --> 01:37:32,506
'cause they were
willing to pay money

1448
01:37:32,606 --> 01:37:34,675
for the privilege of belonging.

1449
01:37:34,775 --> 01:37:36,135
Anybody.

1450
01:37:36,235 --> 01:37:37,644
Lot of nobodies.

1451
01:37:38,812 --> 01:37:41,515
But I can only tell you this,

1452
01:37:41,615 --> 01:37:44,651
I wouldn't pay a nickel
to join this outfit.

1453
01:37:46,028 --> 01:37:50,858
I look upon it, I look upon you
without respect.

1454
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:52,693
Don Vito.

1455
01:37:52,793 --> 01:37:54,661
Shut up!

1456
01:38:02,503 --> 01:38:03,879
First...

1457
01:38:06,465 --> 01:38:08,300
I want to see these people out.

1458
01:38:09,259 --> 01:38:11,045
Get rid of them.

1459
01:38:11,145 --> 01:38:14,598
Give them back their money.
They don't belong.

1460
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,268
Next...

1461
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:23,474
Anastasia was shot because
he made a second mistake.

1462
01:38:23,574 --> 01:38:25,559
I am talking about drugs.

1463
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:28,187
With our influence in the unions,

1464
01:38:28,287 --> 01:38:30,898
in the courts, and with the cops,

1465
01:38:30,998 --> 01:38:32,983
we can walk right in and start to deal.

1466
01:38:33,083 --> 01:38:36,445
I got suppliers from China
to my street waiting for the word.

1467
01:38:36,545 --> 01:38:37,696
So, starting right now...

1468
01:38:37,796 --> 01:38:39,531
Get out! Get out!
Everybody out!

1469
01:38:39,631 --> 01:38:41,784
Quick! Police!
Police! Get moving!

1470
01:38:41,884 --> 01:38:43,710
Don Vito, come on! Hurry!

1471
01:38:44,169 --> 01:38:46,288
Valachi!

1472
01:38:46,388 --> 01:38:48,374
Don Vito, we gotta
get away. Come on.

1473
01:38:48,474 --> 01:38:49,550
- Hurry.
- Where is Valachi?

1474
01:38:50,217 --> 01:38:51,427
Valachi!

1475
01:38:52,136 --> 01:38:53,587
- Valachi!
- Come on!

1476
01:38:53,687 --> 01:38:55,005
What the hell's going on?

1477
01:38:55,105 --> 01:38:57,549
Somebody tipped the cops,
Don Vito.

1478
01:38:57,649 --> 01:38:59,218
I wanted to meet in Chicago,

1479
01:38:59,318 --> 01:39:02,554
but that goddamn Maggadino said,
"Upstate's cool."

1480
01:39:02,654 --> 01:39:05,015
It's cool, all right.

1481
01:39:05,115 --> 01:39:07,810
They disgust me.
They've got no dignity.

1482
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:12,489
I am not gonna lose my self-respect
because of small-time yokels.

1483
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:23,200
Hold it.
Where do you think you're going?

1484
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:25,244
All right, let's get the hands up.

1485
01:39:25,344 --> 01:39:26,912
Come on, let's go.

1486
01:39:27,012 --> 01:39:28,881
Hands over your head!
Get 'em up.

1487
01:39:34,928 --> 01:39:37,673
All right, stop.
Stop right there.

1488
01:39:37,773 --> 01:39:39,007
Hold it. Hold it.

1489
01:39:39,107 --> 01:39:40,601
Hold it right there.

1490
01:39:44,646 --> 01:39:46,598
What's the problem,
Officer?

1491
01:39:46,698 --> 01:39:48,976
Did you just come
from that house?

1492
01:39:49,076 --> 01:39:51,320
As a citizen of
the United States...

1493
01:39:52,404 --> 01:39:55,899
I am aware of my rights
under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,

1494
01:39:55,999 --> 01:39:58,327
and 14th Amendments
of the Constitution.

1495
01:39:59,244 --> 01:40:01,155
Unless you have
an arrest warrant,

1496
01:40:01,255 --> 01:40:03,907
I can sue you
for infringing on my rights.

1497
01:40:04,007 --> 01:40:05,459
Drive on, Joe.

1498
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:09,171
What the hell did he say?

1499
01:40:13,001 --> 01:40:14,001
Jesus Christ.

1500
01:40:14,101 --> 01:40:15,627
No matter how hard they lean,

1501
01:40:15,727 --> 01:40:18,172
no matter how hard they squeeze,
you just took it like a dog.

1502
01:40:18,272 --> 01:40:21,467
When they made you kill your
best friend after they cut his balls off,

1503
01:40:21,567 --> 01:40:24,761
you just pointed that trigger
and called it an act of charity!

1504
01:40:24,861 --> 01:40:28,056
Oh, what the hell
do you know about it?

1505
01:40:28,156 --> 01:40:29,892
And what'd you ever have
that was any better?

1506
01:40:29,992 --> 01:40:31,101
Nothing, Valachi.

1507
01:40:31,201 --> 01:40:32,978
My parents traveled steerage
just like yours.

1508
01:40:33,078 --> 01:40:35,105
They went through poverty
just like yours.

1509
01:40:35,205 --> 01:40:38,484
I fought every day before,
during and after school.

1510
01:40:38,584 --> 01:40:39,976
Big deal.
Instead of being called a wop,

1511
01:40:40,076 --> 01:40:41,862
I was paddy, I was a mick.

1512
01:40:41,962 --> 01:40:43,530
The difference
between us, Valachi,

1513
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:45,324
is that I stopped
spreading my legs.

1514
01:40:45,424 --> 01:40:47,091
Yeah.

1515
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:53,040
And then you joined Hoover's team
and became Jack Armstrong,

1516
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,292
All-American boy.

1517
01:40:55,392 --> 01:40:56,585
Screw you, Valachi.

1518
01:40:56,685 --> 01:40:58,337
I don't have a wife
who's going into hiding.

1519
01:40:58,437 --> 01:41:00,797
I don't have a son who
doesn't know who his father is.

1520
01:41:00,897 --> 01:41:03,550
I don't check the windows
before I leave my house.

1521
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:05,427
If I ever had to kill
to save my own neck,

1522
01:41:05,527 --> 01:41:09,139
I'd make goddamn sure
I killed the right man.

1523
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:12,559
Face the facts, Valachi,
you're one dumb guinea.

1524
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:14,853
Shit. You were a snap to break.

1525
01:41:14,953 --> 01:41:16,230
What?

1526
01:41:16,330 --> 01:41:18,991
I'm the guy that started squeezing you
from the other side.

1527
01:41:19,866 --> 01:41:21,151
Don't you remember?

1528
01:41:21,251 --> 01:41:22,945
After Appalachian,
we were picking everybody up.

1529
01:41:23,045 --> 01:41:25,155
We got over 100 guys,
nobody would talk.

1530
01:41:25,255 --> 01:41:27,074
I still don't get it.
What are you talking about?

1531
01:41:27,174 --> 01:41:29,701
We wanted to know about Vito
and the drug operation.

1532
01:41:29,801 --> 01:41:31,837
I figured we had
to start at the bottom.

1533
01:41:33,839 --> 01:41:36,416
And I'm the guy that
sent those two agents to visit you.

1534
01:41:36,516 --> 01:41:37,759
Yeah.

1535
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:50,180
Uh, we notice you're
enlarging the restaurant.

1536
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:51,807
It's illegal, huh?

1537
01:41:51,907 --> 01:41:54,768
You got a record.
You have to have a license.

1538
01:41:54,868 --> 01:41:56,061
License ain't in my name.

1539
01:41:56,161 --> 01:41:59,239
Then you won't care one way or the other
when it's revoked, will you, Joe?

1540
01:42:03,493 --> 01:42:06,321
First, you find some tax clause
to close my dress factory,

1541
01:42:06,421 --> 01:42:08,782
now you're hustling me
about the restaurant?

1542
01:42:08,882 --> 01:42:10,367
What have I ever done
to you guys?

1543
01:42:10,467 --> 01:42:13,954
Tell us about the Vito organization,
his drug network,

1544
01:42:14,054 --> 01:42:16,415
and we'll forget that license.

1545
01:42:16,515 --> 01:42:19,092
Yeah. Come on.

1546
01:42:34,316 --> 01:42:35,767
How much?

1547
01:42:35,867 --> 01:42:37,361
Everything you know.

1548
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:42,232
I don't know
anything about Vito,

1549
01:42:42,332 --> 01:42:44,009
and I don't know anything
about any organization.

1550
01:42:44,109 --> 01:42:47,329
Okay, all you don't know,
what is it worth?

1551
01:42:47,871 --> 01:42:49,072
Five thousand.

1552
01:42:49,172 --> 01:42:50,449
Fifteen.

1553
01:42:50,549 --> 01:42:52,534
- Shit.
- Apiece.

1554
01:42:52,634 --> 01:42:54,878
Tell them
we're closing this place down.

1555
01:42:56,421 --> 01:42:59,174
Give me a call when you've
thought it over. Come on, DiSavio.

1556
01:43:02,761 --> 01:43:04,338
<i>My boys did a good job on you.</i>

1557
01:43:04,438 --> 01:43:07,090
<i>You thought they were</i>
<i>really on the take.</i>

1558
01:43:07,190 --> 01:43:09,384
<i>Wouldn't be the first time.</i>

1559
01:43:09,484 --> 01:43:12,054
<i>Some bunch, I'm telling you.</i>

1560
01:43:12,154 --> 01:43:14,272
<i>Putting the squeeze</i>
<i>on a respectable businessman.</i>

1561
01:43:15,399 --> 01:43:17,100
<i>Oh, sure.</i>

1562
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:20,654
<i>Anyway, you didn't have the $30,000,</i>
<i>so we guessed where you'd have to go.</i>

1563
01:43:32,165 --> 01:43:34,167
<i>Hey, Bender.</i>

1564
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:38,372
I'm in a bind. I need
30 grand by tomorrow.

1565
01:43:38,472 --> 01:43:40,624
<i>Okay, if you do me a favor.</i>

1566
01:43:40,724 --> 01:43:42,417
Sure, I'll do you a favor.

1567
01:43:42,517 --> 01:43:44,920
<i>Meet me at the docks,</i>
<i>Monday a! 3:00, capisce?</i>

1568
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:48,298
Tony, if you're gonna
connect with the shipment,

1569
01:43:48,398 --> 01:43:52,060
and that's where the money is,
then I'm gonna stick with you.

1570
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:55,480
Okay.

1571
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:59,851
<i>That's how you got'</i>
<i>into the drug business, Joe.</i>

1572
01:43:59,951 --> 01:44:02,145
<i>I gotta thank</i>
<i>the FBI for that, huh?</i>

1573
01:44:02,245 --> 01:44:04,448
<i>No,I'll give you</i>
<i>credit for initiative.</i>

1574
01:44:10,829 --> 01:44:12,781
I'd rather be
driving the car, Tony.

1575
01:44:12,881 --> 01:44:15,584
Shut up
and let me handle it.

1576
01:44:16,752 --> 01:44:18,620
The one with the red mark, that's it.

1577
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:20,172
Okay, take it away!

1578
01:44:20,881 --> 01:44:22,457
It don't smell good.

1579
01:44:22,557 --> 01:44:23,884
Shut up.

1580
01:44:39,107 --> 01:44:41,151
Come on.
Let's go, let's go. Come on!

1581
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:47,115
Mac, the one with the red stripe.
Put it in the car.

1582
01:44:50,619 --> 01:44:52,446
Hey, where's Tony?

1583
01:44:52,546 --> 01:44:53,747
Gee, I don't know.

1584
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:07,676
Aah!

1585
01:45:35,163 --> 01:45:37,791
Open up. Come on. Open up there.

1586
01:45:41,044 --> 01:45:42,754
Hurry up.
It's the police.

1587
01:45:44,673 --> 01:45:46,041
What do you want?

1588
01:45:46,141 --> 01:45:47,667
We got a search warrant.

1589
01:45:47,767 --> 01:45:49,586
Search warrant for what?

1590
01:45:49,686 --> 01:45:50,887
Narcotics.

1591
01:45:51,429 --> 01:45:52,429
Push it.

1592
01:46:02,941 --> 01:46:04,693
Uh, come on, come on.

1593
01:46:21,585 --> 01:46:23,995
Just lay off my stuff, guys.

1594
01:46:24,095 --> 01:46:26,122
I'm very neat.

1595
01:46:26,222 --> 01:46:27,507
He's the slob.

1596
01:46:48,612 --> 01:46:49,946
High grade.

1597
01:46:51,072 --> 01:46:52,983
- Donna?
- Yeah? What is it?

1598
01:46:53,083 --> 01:46:56,611
Somebody stashed that.
Who was up here?

1599
01:46:56,711 --> 01:46:57,946
Nobody.

1600
01:46:58,046 --> 01:47:00,156
Yesterday, Tony Bender

1601
01:47:00,256 --> 01:47:02,200
and Joe Valachi.

1602
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:03,376
Bender...

1603
01:47:04,794 --> 01:47:05,795
Joe Valachi.

1604
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:08,915
<i>It was all too pat.</i>

1605
01:47:09,015 --> 01:47:10,792
<i>Looked too easy.</i>

1606
01:47:10,892 --> 01:47:12,794
<i>Good thinking, Joe.</i>

1607
01:47:12,894 --> 01:47:14,588
<i>I guess it was you.</i>

1608
01:47:14,688 --> 01:47:15,797
<i>Sort of.</i>

1609
01:47:15,897 --> 01:47:18,550
<i>We had a tap on your line</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

1610
01:47:18,650 --> 01:47:22,095
<i>Wasn't too difficult to find</i>
<i>that the meeting was at the docks.</i>

1611
01:47:22,195 --> 01:47:24,014
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

1612
01:47:24,114 --> 01:47:26,524
<i>You guys are twice</i>
<i>as crooked as we are.</i>

1613
01:47:36,117 --> 01:47:39,279
<i>... casualties or damage. New York City.</i>

1614
01:47:39,379 --> 01:47:43,742
<i>This morning, government agents</i>
<i>arrested Mafia kingpin Vito Genovese.</i>

1615
01:47:43,842 --> 01:47:47,537
<i>Reported to be directing the flow</i>
<i>of drugs on the eastern seaboard,</i>

1616
01:47:47,637 --> 01:47:49,289
<i>Genovese is being questioned</i>

1617
01:47:49,389 --> 01:47:52,584
<i>about the pro-dawn shoot-out</i>
<i>on Pier Two in Brooklyn.</i>

1618
01:47:52,684 --> 01:47:56,171
<i>Police officers state that</i>
<i>half a million dollars worth of heroin</i>

1619
01:47:56,271 --> 01:47:58,506
<i>was seized in Genovese's apartment,</i>

1620
01:47:58,606 --> 01:48:02,310
<i>and $2.5 million worth</i>
<i>was found on the docks.</i>

1621
01:48:03,561 --> 01:48:07,691
<i>Arrested were Steff Salerto,</i>
<i>Vincent Maro, and Fred Vilac.</i>

1622
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:14,731
<i>Our news. Tehran University</i>
<i>Geophysics Institute...</i>

1623
01:48:14,831 --> 01:48:16,816
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, Bender.

1624
01:48:16,916 --> 01:48:19,027
<i>Call me at 6:00</i>
<i>at the old lady's.</i>

1625
01:48:19,127 --> 01:48:21,413
<i>...about 310 miles west of Tehran.</i>

1626
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:26,576
<i>The quakes, one measuring five</i>
<i>on the Richter scale and the other four,</i>

1627
01:48:26,676 --> 01:48:28,461
<i>struck only a few minutes...</i>

1628
01:48:34,926 --> 01:48:37,128
Hey, Maria.

1629
01:48:37,228 --> 01:48:39,339
Just talk. Say anything.
I want to hear your voice.

1630
01:48:39,439 --> 01:48:42,634
Why, hello, Helen. How are you?

1631
01:48:42,734 --> 01:48:44,310
I didn't know you were back.

1632
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:47,814
We're all fine, honey.

1633
01:48:49,691 --> 01:48:51,401
Take care of yourself.

1634
01:48:58,324 --> 01:49:01,528
<i>All I could do was drive around</i>
<i>until I got through to Bender.</i>

1635
01:49:01,628 --> 01:49:03,071
<i>My own line was tapped.</i>

1636
01:49:03,171 --> 01:49:04,656
<i>There was no telling</i>
<i>who they'd picked up.</i>

1637
01:49:04,756 --> 01:49:06,541
<i>All but Tony Bender.</i>

1638
01:49:26,352 --> 01:49:28,146
- Hey, Tony.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

1639
01:49:28,313 --> 01:49:30,140
- In the country.
<i>- Where?</i>

1640
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,142
Outside Hartford.

1641
01:49:32,242 --> 01:49:33,810
<i>What's your number?</i>
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

1642
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:35,520
It's, uh...

1643
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:38,531
642-3948.

1644
01:49:45,705 --> 01:49:47,699
<i>Boy, there'd</i>
<i>been so many new guys</i>

1645
01:49:47,799 --> 01:49:51,786
<i>in the family coming and going,</i>
<i>could've been anyone squealing.</i>

1646
01:49:51,886 --> 01:49:53,997
<i>All I thought about</i>
<i>was trying to keep cool,</i>

1647
01:49:54,097 --> 01:49:55,965
<i>keep from getting burned.</i>

1648
01:50:07,727 --> 01:50:09,054
Somebody set us up.

1649
01:50:09,154 --> 01:50:13,933
Don Vito says, if he's arrested,
wants everybody with him.

1650
01:50:14,033 --> 01:50:15,769
What kind of crazy order is that?

1651
01:50:15,869 --> 01:50:18,730
Don't worry.
You'll get off light.

1652
01:50:18,830 --> 01:50:20,106
It's already arranged.

1653
01:50:20,206 --> 01:50:23,701
Oh, no, Tony, I'm not taking
the rap for somebody else.

1654
01:50:33,128 --> 01:50:36,790
Therefore, this court
sentences Joseph Valachi

1655
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:38,291
to the federal penitentiary,

1656
01:50:38,391 --> 01:50:41,586
there to serve
not less than 15 years

1657
01:50:41,686 --> 01:50:43,213
from this day forth.

1658
01:50:43,313 --> 01:50:44,472
You get me an appeal.

1659
01:50:45,515 --> 01:50:49,010
I think I can stand for five,
but if that 15 sticks,

1660
01:50:49,110 --> 01:50:50,804
I'm not going into the can alone.

1661
01:50:50,904 --> 01:50:52,180
You tell Bender that.

1662
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:54,557
What do you have to do
before you fight back?

1663
01:50:54,657 --> 01:50:56,518
Told you everything
I had to say.

1664
01:50:56,618 --> 01:50:58,186
Your books are up-to-date.

1665
01:50:58,286 --> 01:51:00,730
That's not enough, Joe.
Think about Appalachian for a minute.

1666
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:03,283
Think about all those heroes
running through the woods.

1667
01:51:04,576 --> 01:51:06,277
I thought about that a lot.

1668
01:51:06,377 --> 01:51:08,446
Stand up, for God's sake.

1669
01:51:08,546 --> 01:51:10,990
Joe, listen, there's
a Senate hearing commission.

1670
01:51:11,090 --> 01:51:12,700
They can make a law.

1671
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:16,329
That law will cut them down, prohibit
their activities once and for all,

1672
01:51:16,429 --> 01:51:17,914
but you'll have to speak, Joe.

1673
01:51:18,014 --> 01:51:19,833
You have to tell them
what you told me.

1674
01:51:19,933 --> 01:51:21,042
What's in it for you?

1675
01:51:21,142 --> 01:51:24,003
The same thing that's in it for you,
a kind of a peace.

1676
01:51:24,103 --> 01:51:25,964
You want to stay in hell,
that's your business.

1677
01:51:26,064 --> 01:51:28,591
I'm offering you a way out
the other side.

1678
01:51:28,691 --> 01:51:30,025
Aye!

1679
01:51:30,276 --> 01:51:32,971
Suppose I talk to this,
uh, commission.

1680
01:51:33,071 --> 01:51:34,305
Then what?

1681
01:51:34,405 --> 01:51:37,767
The law goes on the books,
and I guarantee it'll be enforced.

1682
01:51:37,867 --> 01:51:40,687
Yeah, and I'm still in solitary
confinement the rest of my life.

1683
01:51:40,787 --> 01:51:42,739
At least you won't go in there blind.

1684
01:51:50,997 --> 01:51:52,832
What about Maria?
My kid, huh?

1685
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,326
Wherever she wants to go,

1686
01:51:55,426 --> 01:51:58,329
I give you my personal guarantee
that she will get there safely

1687
01:51:58,429 --> 01:52:01,925
with a new name, a new passport,
enough money for the rest of her life.

1688
01:52:07,433 --> 01:52:08,506
You think it'll really happen?

1689
01:52:08,606 --> 01:52:10,967
What do you think
I've been after, Valachi?

1690
01:52:11,067 --> 01:52:12,635
Christ, everything you say

1691
01:52:12,735 --> 01:52:15,146
has tremendous implications
for the Justice Department,

1692
01:52:15,313 --> 01:52:16,814
for the country itself.

1693
01:52:18,691 --> 01:52:20,602
You can make a break, Joe,

1694
01:52:20,702 --> 01:52:24,022
not only for everybody else,
but for yourself.

1695
01:52:24,122 --> 01:52:25,490
You can get out of it.

1696
01:52:29,702 --> 01:52:31,871
- When do I take the bat?
- Tomorrow.

1697
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:35,708
Okay, Ryan, looks
like you're on.

1698
01:52:38,628 --> 01:52:40,546
See you later.

1699
01:52:43,299 --> 01:52:45,668
<i>When did you become a member</i>
<i>of this organization?</i>

1700
01:52:45,768 --> 01:52:47,435
<i>1930.</i>

1701
01:52:49,939 --> 01:52:50,974
<i>What's the name of it?</i>

1702
01:52:53,226 --> 01:52:54,644
<i>Cosa Nostra.</i>

1703
01:52:56,062 --> 01:52:57,388
<i>In Italian.</i>

1704
01:52:57,488 --> 01:52:59,474
<i>Cosa Nostra, in Italian.</i>

1705
01:52:59,574 --> 01:53:01,935
<i>I think that it's</i>
<i>an important question</i>

1706
01:53:02,035 --> 01:53:04,312
<i>that there is</i>
<i>no particular pattern</i>

1707
01:53:04,412 --> 01:53:05,605
<i>which would make you feel</i>

1708
01:53:05,705 --> 01:53:07,440
<i>the crime is in</i>
<i>any way a problem</i>

1709
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:09,943
<i>associated with those</i>
<i>of Italian extraction.</i>

1710
01:53:10,043 --> 01:53:13,446
<i>Senator, I'm not</i>
<i>talking about Italians.</i>

1711
01:53:13,546 --> 01:53:15,823
<i>I'm talking about the Mob.</i>

1712
01:53:15,923 --> 01:53:17,667
<i>Continue.</i>

1713
01:53:20,253 --> 01:53:22,964
<i>He gave me this piece of paper.</i>

1714
01:53:23,923 --> 01:53:25,333
<i>I was to burn it.</i>

1715
01:53:25,433 --> 01:53:26,676
<i>Demonstrate what you did.</i>

1716
01:53:27,719 --> 01:53:30,972
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>I took this piece of paper.</i>

1717
01:53:32,473 --> 01:53:34,726
<i>And it's burning.</i>

1718
01:53:37,395 --> 01:53:39,138
<i>It's lighted in your hand.</i>

1719
01:53:39,238 --> 01:53:41,766
<i>And that was symbolic of the fate</i>
<i>that was to befall you</i>

1720
01:53:41,866 --> 01:53:43,351
<i>if you betrayed the organization?</i>

1721
01:53:43,451 --> 01:53:46,062
<i>Senator, what I'm telling you,</i>

1722
01:53:46,162 --> 01:53:48,648
<i>what I'm exposing to you,</i>

1723
01:53:48,748 --> 01:53:51,526
<i>to the press and to everybody,</i>

1724
01:53:51,626 --> 01:53:54,445
<i>this is the promise I'm breaking.</i>

1725
01:53:54,545 --> 01:53:56,489
<i>Even if I talked,</i>
<i>it... it's...</i>

1726
01:53:56,589 --> 01:53:57,865
<i>I shouldn't</i>
<i>tell you this.</i>

1727
01:53:57,965 --> 01:53:59,993
Hey, Ryan, this
thing's fabulous.

1728
01:54:00,093 --> 01:54:02,287
They're trying to make
a monkey out of him.

1729
01:54:02,387 --> 01:54:04,497
I hope they nail
his ass 10 times over.

1730
01:54:04,597 --> 01:54:06,249
They're after headlines,
for God's sake.

1731
01:54:06,349 --> 01:54:07,792
They're after votes.

1732
01:54:07,892 --> 01:54:10,928
<i>So, Genovese was your godfather?</i>

1733
01:54:11,971 --> 01:54:12,971
<i>No.</i>

1734
01:54:14,015 --> 01:54:15,975
<i>Godfather is different.</i>

1735
01:54:16,642 --> 01:54:18,720
<i>When you, uh...</i>

1736
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:21,931
<i>When you go to the church,</i>
<i>you baptize a baby.</i>

1737
01:54:22,031 --> 01:54:23,474
<i>This is a godfather.</i>

1738
01:54:23,574 --> 01:54:25,768
<i>The sworn testimony</i>
<i>you have just heard</i>

1739
01:54:25,868 --> 01:54:28,187
<i>came from the lips</i>
<i>of Joseph Valachi,</i>

1740
01:54:28,287 --> 01:54:31,607
<i>lips that were supposedly sealed</i>
<i>more than 33 years ago</i>

1741
01:54:31,707 --> 01:54:33,443
<i>when he joined the Cosa Nostra.</i>

1742
01:54:33,543 --> 01:54:36,779
<i>But today, before a nationally</i>
<i>televised Senate hearing,</i>

1743
01:54:36,879 --> 01:54:41,117
<i>the 60-year-old convicted burglar,</i>
<i>dope peddler and murderer</i>

1744
01:54:41,217 --> 01:54:42,493
<i>talked in such a way</i>

1745
01:54:42,593 --> 01:54:44,746
<i>that he seemed to draw</i>
<i>the sympathy of the crowd</i>

1746
01:54:44,846 --> 01:54:46,414
<i>and the crime committee.</i>

1747
01:54:46,514 --> 01:54:48,958
<i>Valachi said he was talking</i>
<i>because he wanted to,</i>

1748
01:54:49,058 --> 01:54:50,251
<i>but it's possible that he is talking</i>

1749
01:54:50,351 --> 01:54:54,589
<i>to protect himself from his</i>
<i>syndicate boss, Vito Genovese,</i>

1750
01:54:54,689 --> 01:54:56,883
<i>who had ordered him</i>
<i>killed as an informer.</i>

1751
01:54:56,983 --> 01:54:58,676
<i>But how safe do you feel?</i>

1752
01:54:58,776 --> 01:55:01,054
<i>How do I feel now? Right now?</i>

1753
01:55:01,154 --> 01:55:03,139
<i>How safe do you feel?</i>

1754
01:55:03,239 --> 01:55:05,433
<i>- Now, at this moment?</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

1755
01:55:05,533 --> 01:55:07,143
<i>I feel... fine.</i>

1756
01:55:07,243 --> 01:55:09,479
<i>How would you feel</i>
<i>if you were back in prison?</i>

1757
01:55:09,579 --> 01:55:12,949
<i>I would have to protect myself</i>
<i>against them, Senator.</i>

1758
01:55:13,991 --> 01:55:16,652
<i>I would have to kill</i>
<i>or be killed.</i>

1759
01:55:16,752 --> 01:55:20,448
<i>Now, would it be fair to say</i>
<i>that if you went' back to prison,</i>

1760
01:55:20,548 --> 01:55:21,833
<i>that you would be a dead man?</i>

1761
01:55:23,418 --> 01:55:25,536
<i>If they got to me,</i>

1762
01:55:25,636 --> 01:55:27,955
<i>I wouldn't be</i>
<i>in prison five minutes.</i>

1763
01:55:28,055 --> 01:55:29,290
Two.

1764
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:31,042
<i>Now, here we show</i>
<i>you the Genovese family,</i>

1765
01:55:31,142 --> 01:55:34,470
<i>broken down into its various units,</i>
<i>demonstrating the wide range...</i>

1766
01:55:38,766 --> 01:55:40,435
Listen carefully.

1767
01:55:41,936 --> 01:55:44,355
$100,000 for Joe Valachi.

1768
01:55:56,409 --> 01:55:58,069
Hold it.

1769
01:55:58,169 --> 01:56:01,114
You were fine.
No fault of yours.

1770
01:56:01,214 --> 01:56:03,741
Oh, from your wife.

1771
01:56:03,841 --> 01:56:06,002
- Room's clear, sir.
- Cheer you up.

1772
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:13,918
<i>...pattern</i>

1773
01:56:14,018 --> 01:56:17,672
<i>which would make you feel</i>
<i>that crime is in any way</i>

1774
01:56:17,772 --> 01:56:20,975
<i>a problem associated with</i>
<i>those of Italian extraction.</i>

1775
01:56:22,435 --> 01:56:25,596
<i>Senator, I'm not</i>
<i>talking about Italians.</i>

1776
01:56:25,696 --> 01:56:27,356
<i>I'm talking about the Mob.</i>

1777
01:56:28,232 --> 01:56:29,484
<i>Continue.</i>

1778
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:36,023
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>I took this piece of paper.</i>

1779
01:56:36,123 --> 01:56:37,950
<i>And it's burning.</i>

1780
01:56:41,621 --> 01:56:45,199
<i>It's lighted in your hand.</i>

1781
01:56:45,299 --> 01:56:47,673
<i>And that was symbolic</i>
<i>of the fate that was to befall you</i>

1782
01:56:47,773 --> 01:56:49,462
<i>if you betrayed the organization?</i>

1783
01:56:51,464 --> 01:56:54,125
<i>Senator, what I'm telling you,</i>

1784
01:56:54,225 --> 01:56:56,669
<i>what I'm exposing to you,</i>

1785
01:56:56,769 --> 01:56:58,304
<i>to the press</i>
<i>and to everybody...</i>

1786
01:58:19,010 --> 01:58:20,628
Didn't have time to see it all.

1787
01:58:20,728 --> 01:58:22,255
You were lucky.

1788
01:58:22,355 --> 01:58:23,756
It was kind of ridiculous.

1789
01:58:23,856 --> 01:58:25,967
Like a bad comic strip.
That's what it was.

1790
01:58:26,067 --> 01:58:27,101
I'll see you.

1791
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:34,016
Guard! Guard!

1792
01:58:34,116 --> 01:58:35,693
Help! Get in here!

1793
01:58:36,861 --> 01:58:38,229
Take the weight
off his legs.

1794
01:58:38,329 --> 01:58:39,321
Get the chair up.

1795
01:58:39,421 --> 01:58:41,357
- I got his legs. Got him.
- Cut him down. Cut him down.

1796
01:58:41,457 --> 01:58:43,484
You have him?
Slowly. That's it.

1797
01:58:43,584 --> 01:58:45,069
Easy.

1798
01:58:45,169 --> 01:58:47,613
- Steady now.
- Put him on the table there.

1799
01:58:47,713 --> 01:58:48,914
Put him on the table.

1800
01:58:50,625 --> 01:58:51,659
Where's the doctor?

1801
01:58:51,759 --> 01:58:53,661
- All right. Right here.
- Get the doctor!

1802
01:58:53,761 --> 01:58:55,087
Okay, boys.
Thanks a lot.

1803
01:59:09,518 --> 01:59:11,512
Attaboy.

1804
01:59:11,612 --> 01:59:12,688
Come on, buddy.

1805
01:59:13,648 --> 01:59:15,474
Open up.

1806
01:59:15,574 --> 01:59:17,810
- Joe?
- Okay, I'll take care of him.

1807
01:59:17,910 --> 01:59:19,236
- Come on, buddy.
- Move over.

1808
01:59:26,452 --> 01:59:27,987
We gave him some
letters from his wife,

1809
01:59:28,087 --> 01:59:29,280
but he just tore 'em up.

1810
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:30,498
Look.

1811
01:59:31,791 --> 01:59:34,952
You knew he was in a depressed state.
Why wasn't he given sedation?

1812
01:59:35,052 --> 01:59:37,371
Look, Mr. Ryan,
I can't have a doctor,

1813
01:59:37,471 --> 01:59:39,373
a psychiatrist, and 24 guards

1814
01:59:39,473 --> 01:59:42,543
watching your canary
for the rest of his life.

1815
01:59:42,643 --> 01:59:45,096
I know you can't. I'm sorry.
Wait a minute.

1816
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:50,226
He'll be all right.
He's as strong as a bull.

1817
01:59:51,352 --> 01:59:53,763
As soon as he feels better,
take him down to the infirmary.

1818
01:59:53,863 --> 01:59:55,856
- All right, Doctor. I will. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1819
01:59:57,108 --> 01:59:58,984
Come on, Joe.
Let me give you a hand.

1820
02:00:00,653 --> 02:00:02,146
Take it easy.

1821
02:00:02,246 --> 02:00:04,573
Get over on the bed.
Come on. Let me help.

1822
02:00:11,664 --> 02:00:13,124
Come on. I'll help you.

1823
02:00:34,854 --> 02:00:36,147
Here.

1824
02:00:49,618 --> 02:00:51,487
Joe, I was just...

1825
02:00:51,587 --> 02:00:52,913
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1826
02:00:54,331 --> 02:00:57,785
- You were just following orders.
- Joe, I don't make the laws.

1827
02:00:57,885 --> 02:01:00,705
Christ, don't look to me
for any more alternatives.

1828
02:01:00,805 --> 02:01:03,007
You got burned, Ryan.

1829
02:01:03,966 --> 02:01:08,304
You wanted a law,
but they wanted a gangster story.

1830
02:01:10,473 --> 02:01:12,516
I thought maybe
you had something better.

1831
02:01:14,143 --> 02:01:16,353
I admit I've been had all along.

1832
02:01:18,939 --> 02:01:20,566
Yeah, well, you
weren't the only one.

1833
02:01:21,650 --> 02:01:24,478
I've been taken, too.
Believe me, Joe. I'm sorry.

1834
02:01:24,578 --> 02:01:27,281
Oh, hell. It's like you said.

1835
02:01:29,283 --> 02:01:31,986
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my days in prison,

1836
02:01:32,086 --> 02:01:34,079
but I don't go in blind.

1837
02:01:34,872 --> 02:01:39,034
Anytime you want to come visit,
we'll crawl together.

1838
02:01:39,134 --> 02:01:41,295
Well, at least you get
Genovese on the run.

1839
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:44,924
I hear he's got
$100,000 out for you.

1840
02:01:47,176 --> 02:01:50,129
Anybody else,
it would be a million.

1841
02:01:50,229 --> 02:01:53,090
Genovese, he's a cheap guy.

1842
02:01:53,190 --> 02:01:55,301
Joe, you son of a bitch,

1843
02:01:55,401 --> 02:01:56,802
you know what
you almost just did?

1844
02:01:56,902 --> 02:01:57,970
Yeah.

1845
02:01:58,070 --> 02:02:00,765
No, no. You almost took
your own contract.

1846
02:02:00,865 --> 02:02:02,308
If you had committed suicide,

1847
02:02:02,408 --> 02:02:04,810
that bastard wouldn't have
had to shell out a nickel.

1848
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:07,688
Hey, Ryan, you scored 100%.

1849
02:02:07,788 --> 02:02:11,317
Listen, Joe. I'm gonna keep
you alive just to spite that punk.

1850
02:02:11,417 --> 02:02:14,403
Yeah, and that's not
a bad reason to live.

1851
02:02:14,503 --> 02:02:16,781
Sheer goddamn spite.

1852
02:02:16,881 --> 02:02:19,492
Joe, let's get you
to the infirmary.

1853
02:02:19,592 --> 02:02:20,584
I'm okay.

1854
02:02:20,684 --> 02:02:22,002
I say you're not.

1855
02:02:24,421 --> 02:02:25,631
Guard.

1856
02:02:31,011 --> 02:02:34,215
Now, the first thing we do
is get you back in shape.

1857
02:02:34,315 --> 02:02:36,926
I'll have you moved, Joe.

1858
02:02:37,026 --> 02:02:38,969
Somewhere in the country.

1859
02:02:39,069 --> 02:02:42,014
I'll handpick the guards myself, Joe.

1860
02:02:42,114 --> 02:02:45,860
Make sure none of those Cosa Nostra
bastards ever gets at you again.

1861
02:02:48,028 --> 02:02:50,648
That's gotta be
the one thing I do, Joe,

1862
02:02:50,748 --> 02:02:54,577
make sure you live long after
Genovese's dead and gone.

1863

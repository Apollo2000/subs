00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:32,366
That's Ellsberg. Works for
Lansdale at the embassy.

11
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:33,903

Just hang in there, buddy.
They're gonna fix you up.

24
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,316
Dan?

25
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,987
Dan?

26
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:06,053
Dan!

27
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:09,192
Secretary would like a word.
You wanna follow me?

28
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:17,231
Well, you can say what
you want to the President.

29
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,567
I've read every one
of Ellsberg's reports...

30
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:22,403
and I'm telling you,
it's just not the case.

31
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:23,874
Dan, you know Mr. Komer.

32
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:26,941
He's been discussing the war
with the President...

33
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:28,442
and, well,
his sense is that we've made

34
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:29,877
real progress
over the past year...

35
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,478
but I've been doing my own
review, and it seems to me...

36
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,913
that things have gotten worse.

37
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:34,014
But neither of us
have been in the field.

38
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,249
You have,
you're the one who knows.

39
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,485
So, what do you say?

40
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,390
Are things better or worse?

41
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:42,590
Well, Mr. Secretary...

42
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:45,692
what I'm most impressed by is
how much things are the same.

43
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:48,064
You see, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

44
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:50,999
We put another
hundred thousand troops

45
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,867
into the field,
things are no better.

46
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:55,339
To me, that means things
are actually worse.

47
00:04:57,741 --> 00:04:59,143
Thank you, Dan.

48
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:03,981
Mr. Secretary!

49
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:06,383
Mr. Secretary! Sir!

50
00:05:07,484 --> 00:05:10,585
How was
your trip, sir? Sir.

51
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:11,920
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

52
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:13,687
I don't have
any prepared remarks...

53
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,922
but I'd be very happy to take
your questions one at a time.

54
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,626
- Jim.
- Mr. Secretary...

55
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:19,026
I'm wondering
if the trip left you

56
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,461
optimistic or pessimistic...

57
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,898
about our prospects in this
war and our ability to win it.

58
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,100
He asked whether I was
optimistic or pessimistic.

59
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:26,634
Today, I can tell you
that military progress

60
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:27,802
over the past 12 months...

61
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:29,271
has exceeded our expectations.

62
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:31,939
We're very encouraged by what
we're seeing in Vietnam.

63
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:34,107
In every respect,
we're making progress.

64
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:35,776
And I'm especially pleased
to have had

65
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:37,345
Bob Komer along for the trip.

66
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:38,379
So he could see for himself

67
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,014
that we've been
showing great improvement...

68
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:41,882
in every dimension
of the war effort.

69
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:46,823
Derek.

70
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:56,057
Good night, Dan.

71
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:58,261
- Good night, Dan.
- Night, guys.

72
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:04,567
You okay, Dan?

73
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:09,470
Yeah. Yeah, thought
I'd forgot something.

74
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:10,573
I didn't.

75
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:19,816

The company's selling
how many shares?

103
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:31,304
1.35 million shares.

104
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,274
And the price range is?

105
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:36,810
Between $24.50
and $27 per share.

106
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:38,747
Not exactly
a huge difference.

107
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,881
For them.
But, you know, the bankers

108
00:10:40,883 --> 00:10:42,415
always do fiddle
with the prices.

109
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:46,085
But for us,
that's over $3 million...

110
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:48,990
and that represents
over five years' salary

111
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:50,891
for 25 good reporters.

112
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:53,194
Good. But why spend
in the newsroom?

113
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:54,761
You're far less profitable

114
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:56,731
than Gannett
or Knight or Ridder.

115
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,165
Gannett and Knight and Ridder

116
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:01,135
own monopoly papers
in smaller cities.

117
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:03,871
And our readers are leaders,
you know.

118
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:05,372
They're educated.
They demand more.

119
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:09,412
That's why we invest
in really good reporters.

120
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:11,112
And so...

121
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:13,814
Because quality
and profitability

122
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:15,882
do go hand in hand.

123
00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:18,252
- See?
- Yeah.

124
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:20,654
- You know all this already.
- Oh, gosh!

125
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:21,622
I don't know if I do.

126
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:23,190
- I should get to breakfast.
- Yeah.

127
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:24,891
We don't want Paul or Arthur
too antsy this afternoon.

128
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,093
No.

129
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:27,929
Good luck.

130
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,566
- And thank you, Fritz.
- Mmm-hmm.

131
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,800
- See you downtown.
- I'll see you.

132
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:34,468
You think
this is really necessary?

133
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,670
Oh, God, yes.

134
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:39,240
Darling, you should hear how
they talk at these meetings.

135
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:40,909
It's as if
it's in a foreign language.

136
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:43,213
No, I meant
taking the company public.

137
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:51,785
It seems we are cash poor.

138
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:53,286
You know, barely solvent.

139
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:54,955
That's the newspaper business.

140
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:56,357
That's
our newspaper business...

141
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,958
and we need
the public offering

142
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,160
to stay in business
and to continue to grow.

143
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:01,462
That's what Fritz says.

144
00:12:01,464 --> 00:12:03,263
And he also says
that the family

145
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,501
can maintain control if we...

146
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,602
Anyway, I'm just not sure
your grandfather...

147
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,938
would have wanted us to
give up any control at all.

148
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,243
- Hello?

00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:33,059
Oh?

157
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:34,428
Well,
that makes perfect sense.

158
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,996
Do you agree with that?

159
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:37,964
Without a doubt.

160
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,276
Oh, Jesus.

161
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,208
I'm so sorry.

162
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,878
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Good morning.

163
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,982
So late. I had to get all this
stuff together...

164
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,085
and then I had
an unexpected call.

165
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,987
Well, what is
with the suitcase?

166
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,125
Ben, I told you,
this is the day.

167
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,526
We're meeting
with the bankers today.

168
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:08,094
- Oh, yes. Right, right.
- You know this.

169
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:09,796
I bet you every dollar
in my wallet

170
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:10,930
that you are
the only person...

171
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:13,367
in that boardroom who's read
through all that nonsense.

172
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:16,102
I'm probably
the only one who needs to.

173
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:18,939
What do you think
of Neil Sheehan?

174
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:20,940
Oh, gosh,
his coverage of Vietnam

175
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,676
is just absolutely marvelous.

176
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:23,810
Why?

177
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:26,247
You thinking of trying to
steal him from <i>The Times?</i>

178
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:27,747
I'm not sure
we can afford him.

179
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:30,952
He... He hasn't had
a piece in three months.

180
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:32,319
Oh?

181
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:34,421
Do you think
he's onto something?

182
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,690
Well, I saw Abe
at a dinner party last week

183
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:40,294
and he was looking
mighty, mighty smug.

184
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:42,796
Doesn't he always?

185
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:43,931
So who was it?

186
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,065
Who was what?

187
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:47,200
Your unexpected call.

188
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,271
Oh, I buried the lede.

189
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:52,205
The White House.

190
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,175
- Haldeman rang.
- Yeah?

191
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:56,377
It seems
the President has decided

192
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,246
not to provide Judith...

193
00:13:58,248 --> 00:14:00,314
with credentials
to cover the Nixon wedding.

194
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:02,348
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

195
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,584
They said we could
send another reporter.

196
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:07,253
Oh, yeah? Can't believe that.

197
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:08,988
I know, I know.

198
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,357
- But...
- But what?

199
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,592
I'm not sure I entirely blame

200
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:13,460
the President
on this one, Ben.

201
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:14,661
No?

202
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:16,631
Would you want Judith to cover
your daughter's wedding?

203
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,332
Well, my daughter's
only 10 years old...

204
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:20,067
I think she burned her bridges

205
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:22,170
when she
crashed Julie's reception.

206
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:23,771
- They're being punitive.
- Her pen is so sharp.

207
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:25,173
- Of course it's punitive.
- This is punitive.

208
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:27,440
Of course it's punitive.

209
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:31,444
She compared Tricia Nixon
to a vanilla ice cream cone.

210
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:33,780
- Yeah, she did.
- Yeah.

211
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:35,616
I mean, why would
her father want Judy

212
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:37,184
to cover
his daughter's wedding?

213
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:38,685
Oh, come on.

214
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:39,987
I just...

215
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:43,623
Are you sure we're striking
the right tone here, Ben?

216
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,025
Oh, we're gonna
do this again?

217
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:46,993
No. Uh,
the New Style section.

218
00:14:46,995 --> 00:14:50,463
Sometimes that stiletto party
coverage can be a little mean.

219
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:52,433
I'm handling it.
I'm looking for a new editor.

220
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:53,733
Yes, are you?
Because I know

221
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:56,203
I've talked to you
about this before.

222
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:59,740
You are losing
female readership, you know.

223
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:01,407
And I think you might
want to focus more

224
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:02,543
on what women read...

225
00:15:02,545 --> 00:15:05,515
Katharine, keep your finger
outta my eye.

226
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:13,787
You...

227
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:18,825
These breakfasts
were your idea, you know.

228
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:22,396
Yes. And you are the publisher
and you are my boss.

229
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:24,165
And I, uh...
I value the input,

230
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,400
but I... I heard you
the first three times.

231
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:29,203
You know, I just think
there might be another way...

232
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:31,439
that we could cool it with
the White House.

233
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:34,641
Maybe we could just send
somebody else, you know...

234
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,310
Nope, nope. Nope. I'm not
gonna send another reporter.

235
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,280
Because it's not
hard news, Ben.

236
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:40,615
It's just a wedding.

237
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:42,382
It's not just a wedding.

238
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:43,450
It's a wedding of the daughter

239
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:45,151
of the President
of the United States.

240
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,686
Why not let that girl
have her day?

241
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:48,322
And we can't have
an administration

242
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:49,555
dictating to us
our coverage...

243
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:50,790
just because they don't like

244
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:53,696
what we print about them
in our newspaper.

245
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,300
Wonder if Abe
cares so passionately

246
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:02,402
about who covers
the wedding for his paper.

247
00:16:02,404 --> 00:16:04,405
I don't give a rat's ass
what Abe or anybody

248
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,073
at <i>The New York Times</i>
cares about.

249
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:07,607
Not true.
I give one rat's ass.

250
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:09,676
- Yeah.
- One retromingent...

251
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,513
rat's ass.

252
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:38,372
Well, it's real important.

253
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,774
Can you get him for me?

254
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:44,147
Tell them it's from Sheehan.
Don't walk.

255
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:12,641
It's from Sheehan.

256
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,551
Abe, here it is.

257
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:39,665
<i>Okay,
Broder's got Nixon</i>

258
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,801
<i>working on his second term.</i>

259
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:45,005
<i>Osnos has something on G.I.s
buying heroin in Saigon...</i>

260
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:47,607
but Ryder's got
a rocket on the FBI list

261
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,809
of potential subversives.

262
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:50,377
Save it for the afternoon.

263
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,479
I need Chal and Judith.

264
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:53,780
Judith!

265
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,982
Is that real,
the subversives list?

266
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:58,319
Oh, yeah. Hoover
and Justice keep a copy.

267
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:59,619
Thousands of names.

268
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,288
Geyelin heard the White House
is shutting Judith out.

269
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,356
Yeah, I'm working on that.

270
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:03,723
We think editorial
should run something.

271
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:05,358
I just heard somebody say
they're working on that.

272
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,426
Well, if the White House is

273
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:07,528
gonna take
a stance like that...

274
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,032
don't you think
we should plant a flag?

275
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:16,203
Did you see Sheehan at the
Kissinger press conference?

276
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,370
No.

277
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,139
What about the Al Haig thing?

278
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,143
No, <i>Times</i> sent the new kid.

279
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:23,310
The new kid, huh?

280
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,378
You think Sheehan's
onto something.

281
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,946
Yeah.

282
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:29,482
Well, Neil has been known
to disappear.

283
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,351
No, no. I'm telling you,
he has something.

284
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:34,555
You want me to do
a little digging?

285
00:18:34,557 --> 00:18:37,223
No, that's below
your pay grade.

286
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,561
Intern!

287
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:42,229
You working on anything
important, chief?

288
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:44,632
Uh, no, Mr. Bradlee.

289
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:47,167
Well, everything we do
is important at <i>The Post.</i>

290
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,569
Yeah. That's $40.

291
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:51,638
I want you to take the
first train up to New York...

292
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,441
and go to
<i>The Times</i> building on 43rd.

293
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:54,642
Don't tell them
who you work for...

294
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:57,310
but find a reporter
by the name of Sheehan.

295
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:58,878
Uh, Neil Sheehan?

296
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,519
Yeah, yeah, find out what
Neil Sheehan is working on.

297
00:19:04,286 --> 00:19:06,118
Is that legal?

298
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,790
Well, what is it you think we
do here for a living, kid?

299
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,290
Get a receipt for the tickets.

300
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:12,294
Yeah.

301
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,980
- Morning, Mrs. Graham.
- Hello, morning.

302
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,716
Hello.
Morning, everybody.

303
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,051
- Hi, Oz.
- Mrs. Graham.

304
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,288
Morning, Arthur.

305
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:42,191
Hello. Hello, everyone.

306
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,594
So, everyone's here.

307
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:49,363
- Hello, Ray. My Galahad.
- Good morning.

308
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:50,900
Thank you.

309
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:03,543
And I used to be the only one

310
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:05,479
who brought
his homework to class.

311
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,550
I think we're all here.
Should we get started?

312
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:11,952
Didn't you crash the wedding

313
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:14,253
of Nixon's other daughter
to get a story?

314
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:17,057
Well, I did get a story but I
didn't crash Julie's wedding.

315
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,126
No, just the reception
afterwards, right?

316
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:20,359
There is a distinction.

317
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:21,462
Not to
the father of the bride.

318
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:22,762
He's paying per plate.

319
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,531
I think the American people
are paying per plate.

320
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,066
Wait, let's do
a story about that.

321
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:28,502
- Yeah, let's...
- Judith should crash again.

322
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:29,735
I didn't crash
Julie's wedding.

323
00:20:29,737 --> 00:20:31,038
What would you
call it, Judith?

324
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,873
Well, I would call it
deft reportage.

325
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,508
All right, come on,
come on, everybody.

326
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,647
How are we gonna cover
this Nixon-Cox wedding?

327
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:43,951
Uh... Who else
is gonna be there?

328
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:45,417
- Here.
- Judith's got the guest list.

329
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,287
No, I mean of
the other press.

330
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,290
<i>The Times, the Sun, the Globe,</i>
all the international papers.

331
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,957
All right.

332
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,631
So, we call them,
we call all of them...

333
00:20:56,564 --> 00:20:59,466
and we say Nixon
has shut us out...

334
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,167
and then we ask them
for their notes.

335
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,570
Ben, there's no way in hell
anyone's gonna give me a fill.

336
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:07,508
No, it'll be
an act of solidarity.

337
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,010
They'll be defending
the First Amendment.

338
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:11,845
We'll tell them
that the only way

339
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:13,780
to protect
the right to publish...

340
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:15,984
is to publish.

341
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:22,490
I don't understand.

342
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:25,291
You said
we'd set the price at $27.

343
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:26,859
No, we said there was a range.

344
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:29,629
And the demand on the
road show was soft.

345
00:21:29,631 --> 00:21:32,765
Why not set it at $26?
Or $25 even?

346
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:34,667
Well, Paul, we feel
that setting the price

347
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,736
at $24.50 would be
more prudent.

348
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:38,172
It's just a couple bucks.

349
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:40,040
It's not just
a couple of bucks.

350
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,811
It's 1.35 million shares...

351
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:44,981
so it is...

352
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:48,281
Three million.

353
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:52,653
Over $3 million less.
That's a lot to a newspaper.

354
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:54,553
How many reporters is that?

355
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:55,655
It's 25.

356
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:57,023
Let's not get bogged down.

357
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,459
It has to be quite a few.

358
00:21:58,461 --> 00:22:00,063
At least a dozen. Fritz?

359
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,262
It's 25 reporters.

360
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,432
Twenty-five reporters.

361
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:06,700
Twenty-five reporters.

362
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,835
Gentlemen,
we know it's not ideal...

363
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:10,171
but a few of our investors

364
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:13,473
balked at the nature
of the company.

365
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:14,707
They don't like newspapers?

366
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,478
They like Gannett and
Knight and Ridder...

367
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,678
but frankly they're concerned

368
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,283
about your ability
to turn a serious profit.

369
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:36,296
Gannett and Knight and Ridder

370
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:38,197
own monopoly papers
in smaller markets.

371
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:40,434
That's why
they're more profitable.

372
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:43,671
The whole point of the
offering is to grow...

373
00:22:43,673 --> 00:22:45,839
while investing in the quality
of the paper.

374
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:49,209
Kay and I have talked
a great deal about this...

375
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:52,212
and we believe
that improving quality...

376
00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:55,851
will naturally lead to
greater profitability.

377
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:58,851
Unfortunate.

378
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:00,854
It's more than unfortunate.

379
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:02,623
Doesn't this happen
all the time?

380
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,893
Bankers lowering the price for
their institutional investors.

381
00:23:05,895 --> 00:23:07,560
Fritz, isn't this
what we discussed?

382
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:08,728
I think the family
should consider

383
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,896
giving up some control.

384
00:23:09,898 --> 00:23:12,098
- Maybe another board seat.
- Absolutely not.

385
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,601
This isn't a surprise, Fritz.
Ever since Phil's accident...

386
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:15,735
Arthur.

387
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:18,203
No offense, Kay.
It's unfortunate...

388
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:19,906
but the buyers
are obviously skittish

389
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:21,340
about having
a woman in charge...

390
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:23,543
and it's not like
it's an easy sell.

391
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:26,680
It's a local paper with modest
margins, modest ambitions.

392
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:28,115
I think Mr. Bradlee
would take issue

393
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:29,383
with that characterization.

394
00:23:29,385 --> 00:23:31,350
Sure, she pads
his budget every year.

395
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:33,119
Call my office.
Tell them I'm going to

396
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,021
miss my lunch at Occidental.

397
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:36,924
Another dozen reporters.
For what?

398
00:23:36,926 --> 00:23:38,692
To nip at the heels
of <i>The Times?</i>

399
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:39,858
So we can pretend like

400
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,861
we're even remotely
in the same league?

401
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:44,231
Make it a five o'clock drink
at the Jefferson.

402
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,332
Arthur, Kay was right.
Lazard is just trying...

403
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:47,599
to cut a better deal
by squeezing us.

404
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:48,768
Come on, Fritz.

405
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,836
Why do you think that is?

406
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,038
Because they're bankers.

407
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,606
Which is why
they want more control.

408
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:53,740
They want assurances

409
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:54,875
that she's not
gonna squander it all.

410
00:23:54,877 --> 00:23:56,643
I mean, come on.

411
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:59,044
Fritz, Kay throws
a great party...

412
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:01,882
but her father gave the paper
to her husband.

413
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:03,617
The only reason
she's running things

414
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,987
is because he...
Because Phil died.

415
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:10,957
Don't get me wrong,
I think she is a lovely woman.

416
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,826
But she got rid
of Al Friendly...

417
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,293
and brought in a pirate

418
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:16,963
who does nothing
but bleed our margins.

419
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:18,632
I mean, you can't be surprised

420
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:19,866
that the buyers
are concerned...

421
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:21,100
that she doesn't have
the resolve

422
00:24:21,102 --> 00:24:23,071
to turn a serious profit.

423
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:30,844
Kay, it's your decision...

424
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:32,979
but in my opinion,
if you want this

425
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:35,249
to be more than
a little family paper...

426
00:24:35,251 --> 00:24:38,521
it has to be more than
a little family business.

427
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,427
Thank you, Arthur,
for your frankness.

428
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,028
All right.

429
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:49,396
We're set?

430
00:24:49,398 --> 00:24:51,367
All set, Mr. Parsons.

431
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:55,304
Accident...

432
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:00,243
It wasn't an accident.

433
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:02,575
Phil's suicide.

434
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:06,949
I don't know why people insist
on calling it an accident.

435
00:25:08,116 --> 00:25:10,653
Is it to make them
feel better?

436
00:25:11,754 --> 00:25:14,954
Or do they think
they're being kind?

437
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:17,158
I don't know, I don't know.

438
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:20,027
So, do you think I should

439
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:22,662
give up more seats
on the board?

440
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:24,532
Of course not.

441
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:28,234
We're going to be fine.

442
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,703
Hmm.

443
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:32,606
This passage
in the prospectus,

444
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:35,244
I read it earlier today.

445
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,514
Oh, yes.

446
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:43,716
"In the unlikely instance
of disaster

447
00:25:43,718 --> 00:25:45,050
"or catastrophic event...

448
00:25:45,052 --> 00:25:48,988
"in the week following the
initial public offering...

449
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,924
"Lazard Frères
and Company retains

450
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,925
"full right
to cancel the issue."

451
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,461
It's boilerplate, Kay.

452
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,896
It's standard
contractual language.

453
00:25:58,134 --> 00:26:02,301
But, so, the bankers
could pull out.

454
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:05,104
Only if there's
a true disaster.

455
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,241
Ben gets hit by a truck...

456
00:26:07,243 --> 00:26:11,277
the world
runs outta newspaper ink...

457
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,181
the truck goes
around the block

458
00:26:14,183 --> 00:26:16,416
and hits Ben again...

459
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:18,085
You think
one of those is possible.

460
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:19,953
No, I don't...

461
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,854
but, you know,
the Nixon White House

462
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:23,790
is nothing if not vindictive.

463
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,157
Just this morning...

464
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:28,063
they barred us from covering
Tricia Nixon's wedding.

465
00:26:28,763 --> 00:26:30,563
Somehow,
I doubt that will rise

466
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:32,031
to the level of catastrophe.

467
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,599
I know. Probably not.

468
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:37,171
Although, when Ben sets
his mind to plunder...

469
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:40,743
it's not hard to imagine
something more serious.

470
00:26:42,244 --> 00:26:44,480
Catastrophic events...

471
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,280
do occur, you know.

472
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:51,350
Yeah, but the right to cancel
is only for a week.

473
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:54,587
A week
from the public offering.

474
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:58,491
Seven days after they
ring that bell on Tuesday...

475
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:00,426
the deal is done.

476
00:27:00,428 --> 00:27:01,429
Hmm.

477
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:05,134
It's gonna be fine, Kay.

478
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:25,086
Jesus.

479
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:33,763
Do you know what floor
the newsroom's on?

480
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:35,395
Five.

481
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:37,700
Uh, no, no, six, yeah. Six.

482
00:27:51,946 --> 00:27:53,946
Things are heating up
in East Pakistan?

483
00:27:53,948 --> 00:27:55,815
Well,
five million refugees

484
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:57,951
could destabilize West Bengal.

485
00:27:57,953 --> 00:28:00,020
So, Lindsay's lowering
the boom tomorrow.

486
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:01,654
They gotta cut 100 million.

487
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:04,460
Gonna be some blood on
the floor of Gracie Mansion.

488
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:08,761
I heard the Mayors gave it to
Nixon in Philly.

489
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:10,664
Yeah, Tolchin's down there.
He's filing.

490
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:12,132
Take a look at this.

491
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:13,966
Any of you guys see that piece
on the hijacking?

492
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,100
Jeez, there's been
another hijacking?

493
00:28:15,102 --> 00:28:16,603
You think six pages
is enough?

494
00:28:16,605 --> 00:28:19,905
Well, we got three columns on
the front page. I'll take it.

495
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,075
- On the flight?
- On the flight.

496
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,277
Can I help you, Mac?

497
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,578
Just delivering a package
to Mr. Meetson.

498
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,084
Mattson.
I'll see that he gets it.

499
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:31,818
I knew a couple

500
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,254
whose yacht was shipwrecked
in the South Pacific.

501
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,101
Hold on, quiet.

502
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,392
I knew a couple whose yacht

503
00:28:38,394 --> 00:28:40,359
was shipwrecked
in the South Pacific.

504
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,762
It looks bleak,
so the man asks...

505
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:46,133
"Does the will take care
of the kids?" His wife nods.

506
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:48,502
"What about your mother?"
"Yes."

507
00:28:48,504 --> 00:28:52,071
"Okay, did we
donate to Nixon?"

508
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:54,874
His wife
shakes her head. "Yes."

509
00:28:54,876 --> 00:28:57,478
"Did we pledge or give?"

510
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,610
"We pledged."

511
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,813
"Thank God," shouts the man.
"Nixon'll find us.

512
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:01,915
"We're saved!"

513
00:29:05,987 --> 00:29:08,620
Well, speaking of Nixon,
I just talked to Kissinger...

514
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,457
who was going on about the end
of the China embargo.

515
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:14,194
He's convinced it's a rather
clever geopolitical move.

516
00:29:14,196 --> 00:29:17,297
I think
this is our cue, ladies.

517
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,132
Someone at this table
of luminaries

518
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,666
must have an idea
what they're up to.

519
00:29:20,668 --> 00:29:23,069
I wonder what his buddy
Joe McCarthy would say.

520
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:25,571
The New Style Section
did a lovely piece

521
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:27,007
on Lawrence Durrell.

522
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,509
It's about time
Style had a good piece.

523
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:31,144
I think it's a bit improved.

524
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,546
I hear he's at work on
another series of novels.

525
00:29:33,548 --> 00:29:36,683
I hear he's at work on finding
a fourth wife.

526
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:38,351
I will say, he's
one of the few individuals...

527
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:40,253
who could probably cozy up
to communist China...

528
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:42,121
without fear
of major political cost.

529
00:29:42,123 --> 00:29:43,388
Eh, but is Nixon that smart?

530
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,991
He never laughed
at one of my jokes.

531
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:49,195
Oh, Kay, I don't know
how you do it.

532
00:29:49,197 --> 00:29:50,963
I don't know
how you keep up with it all

533
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:53,032
when you have this day job.

534
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:55,801
You need to read more books.

535
00:29:55,803 --> 00:29:58,637
Kay, could I have just a word?

536
00:30:00,876 --> 00:30:01,911
Um...

537
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,944
Everything all right?

538
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:06,980
- Marg okay?
- Yes, she's fine.

539
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:08,748
Said the procedure
went very well.

540
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,584
Oh, good,
I've been meaning to...

541
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:11,654
I...

542
00:30:12,219 --> 00:30:13,386
I wanted to tell you,

543
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:15,288
and I want you
to hear from me first...

544
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,290
there's an article about me

545
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:19,928
coming out
in <i>The Times</i> tomorrow.

546
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:22,797
It's not flattering.

547
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:25,632
<i>Running? Me?</i>

548
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:27,599
<i>Now, you know me
better than that.</i>

549
00:30:27,601 --> 00:30:29,469
<i>Three days and three
nights and not a word.</i>

550
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:30,636
<i>Well, I've been very busy.</i>

551
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:31,905
<i>For all I knew
you were lying</i>

552
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:33,005
<i>in the gutter somewhere...</i>

553
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:34,440
<i>with a knife in your back.</i>

554
00:30:34,442 --> 00:30:36,009
<i>Lying in the gutter?</i>

555
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,582
<i>Now, look, sweetheart,
I'll tell you what happened.</i>

556
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,248
<i>I was in Birmingham.</i>

557
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,616
<i>Birmingham?</i>

558
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:44,783
Hello?

559
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:46,386
<i>Hello, Ben.</i>

560
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:47,686
Hello, Katharine.

561
00:30:47,688 --> 00:30:50,656
<i>I'm sorry
to bother you so late.</i>

562
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:53,992
<i>Listen, were you able to make
any headway with Mr. Sheehan?</i>

563
00:30:53,994 --> 00:30:56,828
No, no. I haven't.

564
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:01,033
<i>I just had an odd conversation
with Bob McNamara...</i>

565
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:05,474
<i>and I think</i> The Times <i>may
have a big story tomorrow.</i>

566
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:07,839
Oh, damn it.

567
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,676
<i>You know, he wouldn't
give me any details...</i>

568
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:15,984
<i>but Bob said it was quite
detrimental to him and...</i>

569
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:39,338
Ben!

570
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,008
We got 'em.

571
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,608
We got 'em.

572
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,643
Huh?

573
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:45,311
- Yeah, quite good.
- The happy couple.

574
00:31:45,313 --> 00:31:47,280
- Hey, chief!
- Mr. Bradlee.

575
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:49,448
So, did you
track down Sheehan?

576
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,321
No, but, I saw a mock-up
of tomorrow's front page.

577
00:31:53,988 --> 00:31:55,955
There's a big gap.

578
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,692
Nothing there but the name.

579
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:03,229
Shit.

580
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:04,600
Shit.

581
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:06,434
Shit!

582
00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:16,275
- Give us three.
- Here you go.

583
00:32:16,277 --> 00:32:18,813
Here, here, here.
Thank you, thank you.

584
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,849
Thanks, got it.

585
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:28,521
<i>General Haig, sir.</i>

586
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:29,822
<i>- Hi, Al.
- Yes, sir.</i>

587
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,992
<i>What about
the casualties last week?</i>

588
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:33,225
<i>You got that figure yet?</i>

589
00:32:33,227 --> 00:32:35,898
<i>No, sir, but I think
it's gonna be quite low.</i>

590
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:37,530
<i>Fine.</i>

591
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:40,399
<i>Okay. Nothing else of interest
in the world today?</i>

592
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,903
<i>Yes, sir.
Very significant...</i>

593
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:46,338
<i>this goddamn</i>
New York Times <i>expose...</i>

594
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,139
<i>...of the most
highly classified</i>

595
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:49,842
<i>documents of the war.</i>

596
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:52,078
<i>You mean that was
leaked out of the Pentagon?</i>

597
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,415
<i>The whole study that
was done for McNamara.</i>

598
00:32:56,417 --> 00:33:00,654
<i>This is a devastating, uh,
security breach...</i>

599
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:03,123
<i>of the greatest magnitude
of anything I've ever seen.</i>

600
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,390
<i>Well, what's being
done about it then?</i>

601
00:33:05,392 --> 00:33:07,159
<i>Did we know
this was coming out?</i>

602
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,761
<i>No, we did not, sir.</i>

603
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:10,195
<i>I have Doctor Kissinger.</i>

604
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,964
<i>Henry, the thing to me
is just unconscionable.</i>

605
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:15,167
<i>This is treasonable action
on the part</i>

606
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:17,436
<i>of the bastards
that put it out.</i>

607
00:33:17,438 --> 00:33:19,138
<i>I'm absolutely certain...</i>

608
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,908
<i>that this violates
all sorts of security laws.</i>

609
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,609
<i>People have gotta
be put to the torch</i>

610
00:33:24,611 --> 00:33:26,581
<i>for this sort of thing.</i>

611
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:31,550
Christ! McNamara knew
we couldn't win in '65.

612
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:34,455
That's six goddamn years ago.

613
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:38,761
Well, at least
we got the wedding.

614
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:43,529
Is anybody else tired
of reading the news

615
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:45,932
instead of reporting it?

616
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:47,099
Do we have any leads?

617
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:48,533
There's a guy Phil and I know
in Boston...

618
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:49,636
who worked at Defense

619
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:50,971
when McNamara
commissioned the study.

620
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:52,539
All right, call him.

621
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,406
Anybody else?

622
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,542
So that's it?

623
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:59,511
Our best goddamn lead
is coming from editorial?

624
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:01,313
Well, we are sucking hind tit

625
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,581
in our own backyard.

626
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,517
Ben, come on,
it's one story.

627
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,452
No, it's 7,000 pages...

628
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:08,553
detailing how
the White House has been

629
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:10,657
lying about the Vietnam War
for 30 years.

630
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:15,962
It's Truman and Eisenhower
and Jack and LBJ lying.

631
00:34:15,964 --> 00:34:18,264
Lying about Vietnam.

632
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,168
And you think
that's one story?

633
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:23,104
Let's do our jobs.

634
00:34:24,505 --> 00:34:26,040
Find those pages!

635
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,378
Ben, uh...

636
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,947
I might have something.
Maybe.

637
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,983
Well, let me know when it's
a little less wishy-washy.

638
00:34:37,985 --> 00:34:41,190
I'm gonna go chase down
a lead of my own.

639
00:34:45,192 --> 00:34:48,228
Why don't you cut
your bangs, just a little bit?

640
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,965
Mummy,
I'm right in the middle.

641
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,438
It's a bit hard to read,
isn't it?

642
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,043
Harder for you, I imagine.

643
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:02,743
No.

644
00:35:03,045 --> 00:35:04,246
Why?

645
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,579
These were your people...

646
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:09,983
McNamara and Kennedy
and Johnson.

647
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:12,552
Well, Jack and Lyndon
were your father's friends.

648
00:35:12,554 --> 00:35:13,987
You flew down to Texas
with Lyndon

649
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:15,387
the weekend
after his convention.

650
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:17,657
That's your fault. You wanted
to see his helicopter land.

651
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,924
And the instant he saw you,
he invited you to the ranch.

652
00:35:19,926 --> 00:35:22,328
Oh, well, he just wanted
the paper to endorse.

653
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,596
Yes, but my point is

654
00:35:23,598 --> 00:35:25,565
you had Steve and Bill
waiting at home.

655
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:26,766
- You had houseguests...
- I know.

656
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:28,099
...waiting at the farm.

657
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:29,768
You had nothing but dirty
clothes in your suitcase.

658
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,270
How do you know what
I had in my suitcase?

659
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:32,371
Yet you jumped
on Air Force One,

660
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:33,440
spent the weekend...

661
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:34,507
I did not jump.

662
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:35,775
...swimming
and speed-boating...

663
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:37,342
You and Luvie Pearson
said I had to go!

664
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,913
...with Lyndon
and Lady Bird.

665
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:46,686
It's hard to say...

666
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,556
"no" to the President
of the United States.

667
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:56,228
Were you expecting someone?

668
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,999
At this hour?

669
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,337
I hope I'm not too early.

670
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,907
Not at all.
Must be urgent.

671
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:09,708
Where's your sister?

672
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,012
That's my tea, darling.

673
00:36:14,014 --> 00:36:16,983
Where's your sister?
Let's go find her.

674
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:18,754
Let's go find her.

675
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:23,659
I trust you saw
<i>The New York Times.</i>

676
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,157
Hmm.

677
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:27,492
The study, the one
they are working off of...

678
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:29,027
that was commissioned
by Robert McNamara.

679
00:36:29,029 --> 00:36:30,096
Yeah.

680
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:32,498
And if he commissioned it,
he might have a copy.

681
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:40,540
I don't need to tell you
that finding a source...

682
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:42,442
it's like finding a
needle in a haystack.

683
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:43,641
I don't need the metaphor.

684
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:44,710
Well, I haven't been a writer

685
00:36:44,712 --> 00:36:46,045
for a while
so that old cliche...

686
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:48,215
that was the best comparison
I could come up with.

687
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,286
I need a copy
of that study, Kay.

688
00:36:53,822 --> 00:36:55,520
Give her the ball, Ben.

689
00:36:55,522 --> 00:36:57,058
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

690
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,128
You know, Ben,
as much as I do relish

691
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,932
a good investigative
assignment...

692
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:08,067
Bob McNamara is an old friend.

693
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:10,369
He's going through a lot
in his life right now.

694
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:13,706
I just think he's probably
said all he wants to say.

695
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,009
Why do you think?

696
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:17,308
- Why?
- Why?

697
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,777
Why is he talking to you?

698
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,146
Well, I just told you,
he's my friend and...

699
00:37:21,148 --> 00:37:23,951
Is he talking to
any other friends?

700
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:26,851
I'm not sure

701
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:28,954
I appreciate the implication
of what you just said.

702
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:31,257
McNamara is talking
to you...

703
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:33,592
because you are the publisher
of <i>The Washington Post.</i>

704
00:37:33,594 --> 00:37:35,427
That's not true.
No, that is not why.

705
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:37,329
Because he wants you
to bail him out.

706
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:38,431
Because he wants you
on his side.

707
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:39,697
No, there's no ulterior...
No!

708
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:42,201
Ben, that's not my role.
You know that.

709
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:45,337
I wouldn't presume to tell you
how to write about him.

710
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:49,041
Just as I wouldn't
take it upon myself...

711
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:53,012
to tell him he should hand
over a classified study...

712
00:37:53,014 --> 00:37:55,648
which would be a crime,
by the way...

713
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,754
just so he can serve
as your source.

714
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:02,057
Our source, Katharine.

715
00:38:13,735 --> 00:38:15,168
No. Uh... No...

716
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:19,137
I'm not. I'm not going to ask
Bob for the study.

717
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:20,139
All right.

718
00:38:20,141 --> 00:38:21,739
I get it.
You have a relationship

719
00:38:21,741 --> 00:38:23,942
with Bob McNamara.

720
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:27,045
But don't you think you have
an obligation as well

721
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:28,947
to the paper
and to the public?

722
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:30,650
Let me ask you something.

723
00:38:30,652 --> 00:38:32,585
Was that how you felt
when you were

724
00:38:32,587 --> 00:38:34,552
palling around
with Jack Kennedy?

725
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:36,554
Where was
your sense of duty then?

726
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:40,659
I don't recall you pushing him
particularly hard on anything.

727
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:43,496
I pushed Jack when I had to.

728
00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:45,264
I never pulled any punches.

729
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:46,431
Is that right?

730
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:49,601
'Cause you used to dine at
the White House once a week.

731
00:38:49,603 --> 00:38:51,871
All the trips to Camp David.

732
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:53,840
Oh, and that drunken
birthday cruise

733
00:38:53,842 --> 00:38:56,177
on the <i>Sequoia</i>
you told me about.

734
00:38:57,811 --> 00:38:59,043
Hard to believe you would have

735
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,980
gotten
all those invitations...

736
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:04,085
if you didn't
pull a few punches.

737

Hey, uh, let me call you back
from outside the newsroom.

780
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:03,101
Excuse me,
are you important?

781
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:05,404
I'm a general
assignment reporter.

782
00:41:05,406 --> 00:41:06,907
Okay.

783
00:41:38,973 --> 00:41:40,973
Uh, I think I got something.

784
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:42,442
Be my guest.

785
00:41:42,444 --> 00:41:43,976
Can we lose <i>The New York
Times</i> from the nut graph?

786
00:41:43,978 --> 00:41:45,344
Ben, they are
the source of the story.

787
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:47,413
Every time I read <i>The New York
Times</i> above the fold...

788
00:41:47,415 --> 00:41:48,547
- Mr. Bradlee?
- No.

789
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:50,449
I feel like somebody's shoving
a hot poker up my ass.

790
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:51,750
All right, just say <i>The Times,</i>

791
00:41:51,752 --> 00:41:52,951
and drop it
a graph below the fold.

be less painful.

794
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:57,389
I think I got something.

795
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:59,291
"McNaughton had McNamara
plan for action."

796
00:41:59,293 --> 00:42:01,793
Well, that's two months
before the election.

797
00:42:01,795 --> 00:42:03,295
"Suggested
sending large numbers

798
00:42:03,297 --> 00:42:04,929
"of U.S. forces to interlard."

799
00:42:04,931 --> 00:42:06,065
"Interlard"?

800
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:07,132
Where'd you get these?

801
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:08,433
Somebody left them on my desk.

802
00:42:08,435 --> 00:42:09,902
All these guys
sound like they sleep

803
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,406
with a damn thesaurus.

804
00:42:12,505 --> 00:42:15,574
So McNaughton was secretly
suggesting to McNamara...

805
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:16,608
to provoke the North so we'd

806
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,877
- have grounds for escalation?
- Yep.

807
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:19,512
Yeah, it was
in <i>The Times</i> article.

808
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:21,279
It was a good piece.
You should check it out.

809
00:42:21,281 --> 00:42:22,648
- It was well-written.
- Jesus Christ.

810
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,016
Give it to someone who can't
type 91 words a minute...

811
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:26,819
and have it proofed, okay?

812
00:42:26,821 --> 00:42:28,119
- Ben?
- Yeah?

813
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:29,855
I think we got something.

814
00:42:29,857 --> 00:42:31,293
What is it?

815
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:40,668
Jesus Christ.

816
00:42:41,536 --> 00:42:42,934
Shit. Are these

817
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,536
part of the pages
of the McNamara study?

818
00:42:44,538 --> 00:42:45,704
Where did you get these?

819
00:42:45,706 --> 00:42:47,440
Somebody left them on my desk.

820
00:42:47,442 --> 00:42:48,474
On your desk?

821
00:42:48,476 --> 00:42:50,909
- I didn't... It was a woman.
- A woman?

822
00:42:50,911 --> 00:42:53,645
We got over 100 pages
of the McNamara study here.

823
00:42:53,647 --> 00:42:55,648
A hippie woman.

824
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,181
Hey, Debbie,
get me Bagdikian.

825
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:58,282
She had one of those skirts...

826
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,253
He's out.
He went somewhere.

827
00:43:00,255 --> 00:43:01,119
Fine.

828
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,520
Probably
between 5'4 " and 5'6"...

829
00:43:02,522 --> 00:43:06,791
If these are the real thing,
we are back in the ballgame.

830
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,226
It was a tie-dye skirt.

831
00:43:08,228 --> 00:43:11,395
And this is gonna be the front
page of tomorrow's paper.

832
00:43:11,397 --> 00:43:15,502
Um... Give it to Marder.
It's his lucky day.

833
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:24,011
My God, the fun.

834
00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:27,212
<i>RAND Corporation.</i>

835
00:43:27,214 --> 00:43:28,750
Harry Rowen, please.

836
00:43:34,054 --> 00:43:35,288
<i>This is Harry.</i>

837
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:37,288
Harry, it's Ben Bagdikian.

838
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,424
<i>You think someone's
bugging your phone?</i>

839
00:43:39,426 --> 00:43:43,061
I think someone
might be bugging yours.

840
00:43:43,063 --> 00:43:45,663
<i>Why would someone
bug my phone?</i>

841
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,032
If I thought
the McNamara study

842
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:48,266
had leaked from RAND...

843
00:43:48,268 --> 00:43:51,570
I'd bug the phone of the
president of RAND.

844
00:43:51,572 --> 00:43:53,271
<i>It's a DoD study.</i>

845
00:43:53,273 --> 00:43:55,808
A copy of which was sent to
RAND for safekeeping.

846
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,478
Two copies,
if I'm not mistaken.

847
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,514
<i>Jesus Christ, Ben, that leak
didn't come from us.</i>

848
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:04,152
You sure about that?

849
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:06,252
Look, in my experience...

850
00:44:06,254 --> 00:44:08,020
guys who
want stuff like this out there

851
00:44:08,022 --> 00:44:09,221
and have the guts to do it...

852
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:10,521
they're a particular type.

853
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,123
They've got conscience
and conviction...

854
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,393
but they've also got ego.

855
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:16,929
Now, there's a guy that
we both know, okay?

856
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:18,764
He was there
the same time as I was.

857
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:20,199
He left right after.

858
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:22,134
You know
who I'm talking about, right?

859
00:44:22,136 --> 00:44:23,536
Isn't he the first guy
you thought of

860
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:26,206
when you saw
the article in <i>The Times?</i>

861
00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:31,476
<i>Okay, look, I gotta go.</i>

862
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:40,219
Mr. and Mrs. Rosenthal.

863
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:42,290
- Oh, yes, I see.
- You're welcome.

864
00:44:44,058 --> 00:44:45,190
I don't wanna push it.

865
00:44:45,192 --> 00:44:46,826
- Hi.
- Ah, Kay.

866
00:44:46,828 --> 00:44:47,992
What a treat!

867
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:49,762
I'm just going to
apologize in advance.

868
00:44:49,764 --> 00:44:51,130
Great to see you.

869
00:44:51,132 --> 00:44:54,833
I'm no fun at all, Abe.
I'm just so nervous...

870
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:56,335
about tomorrow
at the stock exchange.

871
00:44:56,337 --> 00:44:57,936
And I have to make
a big speech.

872
00:44:57,938 --> 00:44:59,538
- No, no, no, no.
- Poor you.

873
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,007
No, going public is
a good move for <i>The Post.</i>

874
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:04,108
Maybe you can even think
about expanding.

875
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,411
Try to be more
of a national paper.

876
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:08,213
I wish Abe would
let me buy shares.

877
00:45:08,215 --> 00:45:10,148
That's against
company policy...

878
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,684
but if you're nervous
and need distraction...

879
00:45:12,686 --> 00:45:15,822
I do happen to have a copy
of today's <i>Times.</i>

880
00:45:15,824 --> 00:45:16,825
Abe!

881
00:45:17,824 --> 00:45:19,424
Unless you read it already.

882
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:22,895
Oh, you awful man.
You really are.

883
00:45:22,897 --> 00:45:24,329
Can we get you
something to drink?

884
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:26,599
Bundy argues
for sustained bombing.

885
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:27,565
Great stuff.

886
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:28,833
He thinks
it'll turn the tide.

887
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:30,034
This is February of '65.

888
00:45:30,036 --> 00:45:31,404
Jesus Christ.

889
00:45:31,406 --> 00:45:33,739
But by April, they realize
it's not gonna cut it...

890
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:35,507
and LBJ sends two battalions.

891
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:36,875
- Great stuff.
- And get this.

892
00:45:36,877 --> 00:45:38,311
He changes the mission

893
00:45:38,313 --> 00:45:40,411
from base security
to active combat.

894
00:45:40,413 --> 00:45:42,348
- My God.
- It's a huge shift.

895
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,882
He's widening the war.

896
00:45:43,884 --> 00:45:45,550
But he insists on secrecy.

897
00:45:45,552 --> 00:45:47,186
The American people are
not to be told.

898
00:45:47,188 --> 00:45:48,654
All right, okay.
So this is the real deal...

899
00:45:48,656 --> 00:45:50,456
so how long
till you can write it up?

900
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,123
I can have it for Thursday.

901
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,259
Well, what if we pretend

902
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:55,460
you're a reporter,
not a novelist?

903
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:56,962
Uh, I suppose I could pull

904
00:45:56,964 --> 00:45:58,396
something together
by tomorrow night.

905
00:45:58,398 --> 00:46:00,400
Okay, we can
run it on Wednesday.

906
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:03,335
I know
we need to get this out, Ben,

907
00:46:03,337 --> 00:46:04,770
but I'd like to
spend a minute...

908
00:46:04,772 --> 00:46:07,172
going through what we've got
on Rolling Thunder.

909
00:46:07,174 --> 00:46:08,741
Go through
all the research you want...

910
00:46:08,743 --> 00:46:10,509
but so help me God,
if we don't have

911
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:12,143
these pages
by tomorrow night...

912
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:13,445
we might as well
not have them at all.

913
00:46:13,447 --> 00:46:14,516
Too late.

914
00:46:15,715 --> 00:46:16,782
What?

915
00:46:16,784 --> 00:46:18,186
<i>Times</i> already has it.

916
00:46:22,121 --> 00:46:23,454
Well, of course they have it.

917
00:46:23,456 --> 00:46:25,724
"President Johnson
decided on April 1, 1965..."

918
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:28,460
Of course <i>The Times</i> had...
Written by Neil Sheehan.

919
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:31,096
"...because
a month of bombing..."

920
00:46:31,098 --> 00:46:32,498
<i>Neil Sheehan's a bastard.</i>

921
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,965
<i>He's been a bastard for years.</i>

922
00:46:33,967 --> 00:46:35,833
<i>Mr. President,
the Attorney General</i>

923
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,235
<i>has called a couple times...</i>

924
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:40,172
<i>about these</i>
New York Times <i>stories.</i>

925
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:41,907
<i>You mean to
prosecute</i> The Times?

926
00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:43,342
<i>Hell, my view is</i>

927
00:46:43,344 --> 00:46:45,244
<i>to prosecute the goddamn
pricks that gave it to 'em.</i>

928
00:46:45,246 --> 00:46:46,344
<i>If you can
find out who that is.</i>

929
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:47,478
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

930
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,313
<i>I mean, could</i> The Times
<i>be prosecuted?</i>

931
00:46:49,315 --> 00:46:51,382
<i>Apparently so.</i>

932
00:46:51,384 --> 00:46:52,550
<i>As far as</i>
The Times <i>is concerned,</i>

933
00:46:52,552 --> 00:46:53,886
<i>hell, they're our enemies.</i>

934
00:46:53,888 --> 00:46:56,654
<i>I think we just oughta do it.</i>

935
00:46:56,656 --> 00:46:58,592
Son of a bitch.

936
00:47:01,763 --> 00:47:02,929
Abe Rosenthal.

937
00:47:02,931 --> 00:47:05,699
Good evening. Their table
is right over there, sir.

938
00:47:07,268 --> 00:47:09,268
Brownell and Loeb over
at Lord Day and Lord...

939
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:12,637
told Punch in no uncertain
terms not to publish.

940
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,806
Only after Scotty Reston
threatened

941
00:47:14,808 --> 00:47:16,407
to publish
in the <i>Vineyard Gazette...</i>

942
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:18,043
did Punch decide to print.

943
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:20,579
Wouldn't have had
quite the same impact.

944
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:22,683
Jimmy.

945
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:28,721
We've been asked to refrain
from further publication...

946
00:47:28,723 --> 00:47:30,858
by the Attorney General.

947
00:47:32,259 --> 00:47:34,762
Nixon's taking us to court?

948
00:47:40,835 --> 00:47:42,534
Kay, I'm sorry...

949
00:47:42,536 --> 00:47:43,804
Oh, no.

950
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,676
Gosh.

951
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,279
Why don't I go get the check?

952
00:47:55,281 --> 00:47:56,782
No, sit tight,
don't argue with me.

953
00:47:56,784 --> 00:47:58,720
I'll be right back.

954
00:48:03,891 --> 00:48:06,358
Mr. Rosenthal
had to leave on business.

955
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,259
Certainly,
we'll put it on his tab.

956
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:09,494
No, I'll take the bill,

957
00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:12,230
but could I trouble you
to use your telephone?

958
00:48:12,232 --> 00:48:13,667
But of course, madam.

959
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:23,476
There's a fella I overlapped
with at RAND.

960
00:48:23,478 --> 00:48:25,576
He was a bit of
a showboat, but smart.

961
00:48:25,578 --> 00:48:27,279
And he worked for McNamara...

962
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:28,512
and he had opinions

963
00:48:28,514 --> 00:48:31,616
on the decision-making
that went into Vietnam.

964
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:32,516
Okay.

965
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:35,454
Word is, he doved.
Pretty hard.

966
00:48:35,456 --> 00:48:37,523
Would he have access
to the study?

967
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:39,625
Pretty sure RAND had a copy.

968
00:48:39,627 --> 00:48:42,828
No shit. All right,
well, can you find him?

969
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,996
Thought maybe I'd try.

970
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,704
<i>I've got
Mrs. Graham on the line.</i>

971
00:48:51,906 --> 00:48:53,639
Katharine.

972
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:57,409
<i>Hey, listen,
I've got tomorrow's headline.</i>

973
00:48:57,411 --> 00:49:00,478
Oh, Christ, okay, again?

974
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,614
<i>John Mitchell contacted</i>
The Times.

975
00:49:02,616 --> 00:49:05,753
<i>Seems the President is going
to seek an injunction.</i>

976
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,286
No, shit.

977
00:49:08,288 --> 00:49:10,554
This means that we're in
the goddamn ballgame.

978
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:12,791
Because if <i>The Times</i>
gets shut down...

979
00:49:12,793 --> 00:49:13,893
<i>If they get shut down,</i>

980
00:49:13,895 --> 00:49:16,762
<i>there is no ballgame.
Ballgame's over.</i>

981
00:49:16,764 --> 00:49:17,795
Now, Katharine,

982
00:49:17,797 --> 00:49:20,433
anybody would kill
to have a crack at this.

983
00:49:20,435 --> 00:49:23,235
<i>Well, sure, but not if it
means breaking the law.</i>

984
00:49:23,237 --> 00:49:27,405
<i>If a federal judge stops</i>
The Times <i>from publishing...</i>

985
00:49:27,407 --> 00:49:29,875
<i>well, I don't see how

986
00:49:29,877 --> 00:49:32,612

get hold of a copy.</i>

987
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:38,518
<i>Ben?
You have something?</i>

988
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:41,253
No.

989
00:49:41,255 --> 00:49:44,355
<i>Okay, so then there's
nothing to talk about really.</i>

990
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:47,425
No, nothing
to talk about at all...

991
00:49:47,427 --> 00:49:50,462
but thank you for the tip,
Mrs. Graham.

992
00:49:51,565 --> 00:49:53,801
What are you still doing here?

993
00:50:17,558 --> 00:50:19,060
Excuse me.

994
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,098
All right.

995
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:28,199
Oh, there she is.

996
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:29,800
- Hello.
- How are ya, Kay?

997
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:32,070
Good morning, everyone.
Good to see you.

998
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:32,938
<i>Hello?</i>

999
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,639
Yeah, I'm looking
for Dan Ellsberg.

1000
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:36,407
<i>He doesn't work here anymore.</i>

1001
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,242
Do you know where he is now?

1002
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,378
<i>No, I don't. Who is this?</i>

1003
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,846
Thank you.

1004
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:44,416
And it is
my great privilege to welcome

1005
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:46,518
The Washington Post Company...

1006
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,022
to the American
Stock Exchange.

1007
00:50:53,761 --> 00:50:56,261
More than a privilege,
Mrs. Graham.

1008
00:50:56,263 --> 00:50:57,797
This is a real honor.

1009
00:50:58,764 --> 00:50:59,864
<i>Hello, this is Karen.</i>

1010
00:50:59,866 --> 00:51:01,299
Yeah, I'm looking
for Dan Ellsberg.

1011
00:51:01,301 --> 00:51:02,904
<i>You got the wrong number.</i>

1012
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:06,304
Speech.

1013
00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:08,643
Go and project
confidence, Kay.

1014
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:11,646
Gentlemen...

1015
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:14,978
thank you all for helping make

1016
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,784
The Washington Post
a more robust company.

1017
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:21,552
<i>Center
for International Studies.</i>

1018
00:51:21,554 --> 00:51:23,355
Yeah, I'm looking
for Dan Ellsberg.

1019
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:24,891
<i>He's not here.</i>

1020
00:51:26,058 --> 00:51:27,692
But he still works there?

1021
00:51:27,694 --> 00:51:30,661
<i>Yes. Can I take a message?</i>

1022
00:51:30,663 --> 00:51:33,431
Uh, tell him
Ben Bagdikian called.

1023
00:51:33,433 --> 00:51:34,532
Congratulations.

1024
00:51:34,534 --> 00:51:35,599
Guys, why don't we

1025
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:36,934
get together for a photograph?

1026
00:51:36,936 --> 00:51:38,103
- Yes.
- Good idea. Absolutely.

1027
00:51:38,105 --> 00:51:39,404
- Here we go.
- Let me see it.

1028
00:51:39,406 --> 00:51:41,373
- Smile, Kay.
- Shall I hold it?

1029
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,041
You just bought
a share of <i>The Post!</i>

1030
00:51:43,043 --> 00:51:45,576
I know. I'm so happy.

1031
00:51:45,578 --> 00:51:50,882
1.35 million shares
at $24.50 a share.

1032
00:51:53,853 --> 00:51:56,288
I believe this will not only
make <i>The Post</i> solvent...

1033
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,556
but stronger
than it ever has been.

1034
00:51:58,558 --> 00:51:59,690
- To <i>The Post!</i>
<i>- The Post!</i>

1035
00:51:59,692 --> 00:52:01,460
He said to call
from a secure phone.

1036
00:52:01,462 --> 00:52:02,763
Mmm-hmm.

1037
00:52:09,703 --> 00:52:11,302
I hear
Kennedy said Phil Graham

1038
00:52:11,304 --> 00:52:12,737
was the smartest man
he ever met.

1039
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:15,540
Yeah, for Kay's father to hand
her husband the company...

1040
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:17,442
says something about the guy.

1041
00:52:17,444 --> 00:52:20,746
I thought it said something
about the time.

1042
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:22,246
Turn it up.

1043

1057
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,511
Think Jefferson just
rolled over in his grave.

1058
00:52:52,513 --> 00:52:55,547
Have the courts ever stopped a
paper from publishing before?

1059
00:52:55,549 --> 00:52:59,117
Not in the history
of the republic.

1060
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,485
Good thing
we're not part of this mess.

1061

I'd give my left one

1064
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,128
All right.

1065
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:14,100

- <i>Yeah. Hey, Ben, it's Dan.</i>

1079
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:26,637
Dan, it's good
to hear your voice.

1080
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,340
<i>Yeah, it's been a while.</i>

1081
00:54:28,342 --> 00:54:29,710
Yeah.

1082
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,063

1083
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:00,741
Ben.

1084
00:55:01,074 --> 00:55:02,375
Dan.

1085
00:55:07,813 --> 00:55:10,549
The study had 47 volumes.

1086
00:55:10,551 --> 00:55:12,284
I slipped out
a couple at a time.

1087
00:55:12,286 --> 00:55:13,821
Took me months to copy it all.

1088
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:18,824
What the hell?

1089
00:55:18,826 --> 00:55:21,793
Well, we were
all former government guys.

1090
00:55:21,795 --> 00:55:23,695
Top clearance, all of that.

1091
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:25,730
McNamara wanted
academics to have

1092
00:55:25,732 --> 00:55:27,565
the chance to examine
what had happened.

1093
00:55:27,567 --> 00:55:28,666
He would say to us,

1094
00:55:28,668 --> 00:55:30,367
"Let the chips fall
where they may."

1095
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,570
Brave man.

1096
00:55:31,572 --> 00:55:34,338
Well, I think guilt was a
bigger motivator than courage.

1097
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,241
McNamara didn't lie
as well as the rest...

1098
00:55:36,243 --> 00:55:39,344
but I don't think he saw what
was coming, what we'd find.

1099
00:55:39,346 --> 00:55:41,579
But it didn't take him long
to figure out...

1100
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:42,681
well, for us all
to figure out

1101
00:55:42,683 --> 00:55:44,516
if the public ever saw
these papers...

1102
00:55:44,518 --> 00:55:46,150
they would turn
against the war.

1103
00:55:46,152 --> 00:55:49,154
Covert ops, guaranteed debt,
rigged elections?

1104
00:55:49,156 --> 00:55:53,090
It's all in there.
Ike, Kennedy, Johnson.

1105
00:55:53,092 --> 00:55:54,793
They violated
the Geneva Convention.

1106
00:55:54,795 --> 00:55:57,529
They lied to Congress
and they lied to the public.

1107
00:55:57,531 --> 00:56:01,699
They knew we couldn't win
and still sent boys to die.

1108
00:56:01,701 --> 00:56:03,436
What about Nixon?

1109
00:56:04,705 --> 00:56:06,503
He's just carrying on
like all the others.

1110
00:56:06,505 --> 00:56:09,777
Too afraid to be the one who
loses the war on his watch.

1111
00:56:11,177 --> 00:56:14,045
Someone said this
at some point...

1112
00:56:14,047 --> 00:56:16,984
about why we stayed
when we knew we were losing.

1113
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:20,485
10% was to help
the South Vietnamese.

1114
00:56:20,487 --> 00:56:22,356
20% was to hold back
the commies.

1115
00:56:23,324 --> 00:56:25,556
70% was to avoid

1116
00:56:25,558 --> 00:56:28,326
the humiliation
of an American defeat.

1117
00:56:28,328 --> 00:56:32,530
70% of those boys...

1118
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:34,835
just to avoid
being humiliated?

1119
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:37,071
That stuck with me.

1120
00:56:45,978 --> 00:56:47,911
They're gonna come after you,
you know.

1121
00:56:47,913 --> 00:56:50,215
And I gotta be honest...

1122
00:56:50,217 --> 00:56:53,119
the bread crumbs
weren't too hard to follow.

1123
00:56:54,621 --> 00:56:55,856
I know.

1124
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:00,324
They're gonna
lock you up, Dan.

1125
00:57:00,326 --> 00:57:03,464
Wouldn't you go to prison
to stop this war?

1126
00:57:05,331 --> 00:57:07,534
Theoretically, sure.

1127
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:14,107
You are gonna
publish these documents?

1128
00:57:16,442 --> 00:57:17,844
Yeah.

1129
00:57:18,645 --> 00:57:21,382
Even with the injunction?

1130
00:57:23,016 --> 00:57:24,185
Yes.

1131
00:57:28,087 --> 00:57:31,324
Well, then it's not
so theoretical then, is it?

1132
00:57:41,935 --> 00:57:45,072
I'm gonna go do some
work in the studio.

1133
00:57:53,246 --> 00:57:56,183
My day was great,
thanks for asking.

1134
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:15,368
That picture makes me sad.

1135
00:58:16,569 --> 00:58:18,237
Me too.

1136
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,009
- Bradlee.
<i>- I'm in Boston.</i>

1137
00:58:25,011 --> 00:58:27,244
I'm gonna need two seats.

1138
00:58:27,246 --> 00:58:28,179
Why?

1139
00:58:28,181 --> 00:58:30,348
I'm gonna need to
buy two seats

1140
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,882
on the first flight
out tomorrow...

1141
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:33,486
probably first class.

1142
00:58:34,587 --> 00:58:36,389
No shit, you have them?

1143
00:58:38,824 --> 00:58:41,291
Well then just get
your ass back here...

1144
00:58:41,293 --> 00:58:42,860
and come
straight to the house.

1145
00:58:42,862 --> 00:58:44,362
Get Chal and Meg
and the others.

1146
00:58:44,364 --> 00:58:45,630
I don't want
the whole newsroom

1147
00:58:45,632 --> 00:58:46,831
knowing about this yet.

1148
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:48,132
I gotta go.

1149
00:58:48,134 --> 00:58:50,601
Didn't you just invite
a bunch of people over?

1150
00:58:50,603 --> 00:58:51,802
Yeah.

1151
00:58:51,804 --> 00:58:54,038
Yeah, they'll show up
sometime tomorrow.

1152
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,172
When sometime tomorrow?

1153
00:58:55,174 --> 00:58:56,907
Is this a breakfast thing
or a lunch thing?

1154
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:59,043
- Don't know.
- Do you need me to get things?

1155
00:58:59,045 --> 00:59:00,779
- Nah, we'll figure it all out.
- Okay.

1156
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:02,813
- Well, where are you going?
- Out.

1157
00:59:02,815 --> 00:59:04,482
- You going to the newsroom?
- No.

1158
00:59:04,484 --> 00:59:05,983
Love you, bear.

1159
00:59:07,186 --> 00:59:09,320
I got a cake.
I hope it's okay?

1160
00:59:09,322 --> 00:59:12,259
Oh, sure, as long as nobody
counts the candles.

1161
00:59:14,094 --> 00:59:16,761
Uh, sorry to barge in again.

1162
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:18,996
Maybe I should give you a key.

1163
00:59:18,998 --> 00:59:21,766
Ah, not here
to crash your party.

1164
00:59:21,768 --> 00:59:22,900
What's up?

1165
00:59:22,902 --> 00:59:25,003
Well, I could use a minute.

1166
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,145
So, can I ask you a
hypothetical question?

1167
00:59:34,147 --> 00:59:36,413
Oh, dear, I don't like
hypothetical questions.

1168
00:59:36,415 --> 00:59:37,882
Well, I don't think
you're gonna

1169
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:39,419
like the real one either.

1170
00:59:42,556 --> 00:59:43,991
Do you have the papers?

1171
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:46,994
Not yet.

1172
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:54,065
Oh, gosh,
because you know...

1173
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:56,967
the position
that would put me in.

1174
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:58,436
You know, we have language

1175
00:59:58,438 --> 01:00:00,103
in the prospectus
that we've...

1176
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:02,574
Yeah, I know that the
bankers can change their mind.

1177
01:00:02,576 --> 01:00:04,775
And I know what is at stake.

1178
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:06,076
You know...

1179
01:00:06,078 --> 01:00:08,679
the only couple I knew
that both Kennedy

1180
01:00:08,681 --> 01:00:10,282
and LBJ wanted
to socialize with...

1181
01:00:10,284 --> 01:00:14,521
was you and your husband and
you owned the damn paper.

1182
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:18,088
Of course that's the way
things worked.

1183
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:20,358
Politicians and the press,
they trusted each other...

1184
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,059
so they could go to
the same dinner party

1185
01:00:22,061 --> 01:00:23,561
and drink cocktails
and tell jokes...

1186
01:00:23,563 --> 01:00:25,596
while there was a war
waging in Vietnam.

1187
01:00:25,598 --> 01:00:27,297
Ben, I don't know
what we're talking about.

1188
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:29,300
I'm not protecting Lyndon.

1189
01:00:29,302 --> 01:00:30,668
No, you got his former
Secretary of Defense,

1190
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,802
Robert McNamara...

1191
01:00:31,804 --> 01:00:33,971
the man
who commissioned this study.

1192
01:00:33,973 --> 01:00:35,373
He's one of about
a dozen party guests...

1193
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:37,174
- out on your patio.
- I'm not protecting him.

1194
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:38,241
I'm not protecting
any of them.

1195
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:39,543
I'm protecting the paper.

1196
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:43,246
Yeah? Well, I wasn't a stooge
for Jack Kennedy.

1197
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:44,882
The night he was assassinated

1198
01:00:44,884 --> 01:00:47,219
Tony and I were down
at the Naval Hospital...

1199
01:00:47,221 --> 01:00:50,954
so we would be there to meet
Jackie when she landed.

1200
01:00:50,956 --> 01:00:52,023
She was bringing Jack's body

1201
01:00:52,025 --> 01:00:53,824
back on the plane
from Dallas...

1202
01:00:53,826 --> 01:00:56,194
and she walked into the room.

1203
01:00:56,196 --> 01:00:58,128
She was still
wearing that pink suit

1204
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,665
with Jack's blood all over it.

1205
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:03,867
She fell into Tony's arms
and they held each other...

1206
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:06,072
for quite a long time.

1207
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,373
And then Jackie looked at me
and said...

1208
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,043
"None of this,
none of what you see,

1209
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:14,311
"none of what I say...

1210
01:01:14,313 --> 01:01:18,882
"is ever going to be
in your newspaper, Ben."

1211
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,853
And that just about
broke my heart.

1212
01:01:21,855 --> 01:01:24,020
I never...

1213
01:01:24,022 --> 01:01:25,790
I never thought of Jack
as a source,

1214
01:01:25,792 --> 01:01:27,824
I thought of him as a friend.

1215
01:01:27,826 --> 01:01:30,194
And that was my mistake.

1216
01:01:30,196 --> 01:01:33,665
And it was something that
Jack knew all along.

1217
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:36,636
We can't be both.
We have to choose.

1218
01:01:37,002 --> 01:01:38,603
And...

1219
01:01:38,605 --> 01:01:40,270
And that's the point.

1220
01:01:40,272 --> 01:01:42,306
The days of us all
smoking cigars together

1221
01:01:42,308 --> 01:01:45,043
down on Pennsylvania Avenue
are over.

1222
01:01:45,045 --> 01:01:49,249
Your friend McNamara's
study proves that.

1223
01:01:50,049 --> 01:01:52,219
The way they lied.

1224
01:01:53,587 --> 01:01:55,753
The way they lied.

1225
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:57,858
Those days have to be over.

1226
01:01:59,491 --> 01:02:02,592
We have to be the check
on their power.

1227
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,862
If we don't
hold them accountable,

1228
01:02:04,864 --> 01:02:07,301
I mean, my God, who will?

1229
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:10,402
Well, I've never
smoked a cigar...

1230
01:02:10,404 --> 01:02:13,103
and I have no problem
holding Lyndon or Jack...

1231
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,473
or Bob or any of them
accountable.

1232
01:02:15,475 --> 01:02:17,775
But we can't
hold them accountable

1233
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:19,679
if we don't have a newspaper.

1234
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:24,014
When I get my hands
on that study...

1235
01:02:24,016 --> 01:02:26,652
what are you going to do,
Mrs. Graham?

1236
01:02:30,022 --> 01:02:32,056
Oh, uh...

1237
01:02:32,058 --> 01:02:33,625
Happy birthday, by the way.

1238
01:02:36,163 --> 01:02:38,529
Oh, that's not what I heard.

1239
01:02:38,531 --> 01:02:39,730
Am I right?

1240
01:02:45,371 --> 01:02:46,871
- Hi. Good morning.
- Club soda.

1241
01:02:46,873 --> 01:02:48,542
- Enjoy your flight.
- Yes, thank you.

1242
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:51,476
Sir, I'm gonna need
to put your seat

1243
01:02:51,478 --> 01:02:53,610
in the full upright position
before takeoff.

1244
01:02:53,612 --> 01:02:54,647
Yeah.

1245
01:02:55,248 --> 01:02:57,415
Must be precious cargo.

1246
01:02:57,417 --> 01:03:00,585
Yeah. It's just
government secrets.

1247
01:03:00,587 --> 01:03:04,324
Please fasten
your seatbelt. Thank you.

1248
01:03:17,337 --> 01:03:20,404
- You know why we're here?
- Beats me.

1249
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:22,172
- Hi, Marina.
- Hi.

1250
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,409
- Do you want lemonade?
- Little early for me.

1251
01:03:24,411 --> 01:03:26,076
Loosen up, I'm buying.

1252
01:03:26,078 --> 01:03:28,378
What kinda lemonade
do you have there?

1253
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,248
Uh... It's the one
with the lemons in it.

1254
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:32,451
Okay.

1255
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:35,254
There you go.

1256
01:03:37,322 --> 01:03:39,525
Phil, help me out.

1257
01:03:41,226 --> 01:03:43,362
Grab my briefcase.

1258
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,630
- Is that...?
- Yep.

1259
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:00,911
It's not the full report

1260
01:04:00,913 --> 01:04:03,350
but it's over
4,000 pages of it.

1261
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:08,353
- Are these in order?
- I don't think so.

1262
01:04:08,355 --> 01:04:09,654
There are no page numbers.

1263
01:04:09,656 --> 01:04:11,554
Yeah, that's where the
top secret stamps were.

1264
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,056
My source had to cut 'em off.

1265
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:14,491
I was supposed to
retire on Friday.

1266
01:04:14,493 --> 01:04:16,027
Ben, how we supposed
to comb through

1267
01:04:16,029 --> 01:04:17,161
4,000 pages of material?

1268
01:04:17,163 --> 01:04:18,329
They're not even
loosely organized?

1269
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:19,596
<i>The Times</i> had three months.

1270
01:04:19,598 --> 01:04:20,797
There's no way
we can possibly get this done.

1271
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,565
He's right. We've got
less than eight hours.

1272
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,201
We could shoot for city.
Then we'd have ten.

1273
01:04:24,203 --> 01:04:25,670
Hey, hey, hey.
For the last six years

1274
01:04:25,672 --> 01:04:27,170
we've been playin' catch-up...

1275
01:04:27,172 --> 01:04:28,273
and now thanks to

1276
01:04:28,275 --> 01:04:29,674
the President
of the United States...

1277
01:04:29,676 --> 01:04:31,308
who, by the way,
is taking a shit

1278
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:32,976
all over
the First Amendment...

1279
01:04:32,978 --> 01:04:34,645
we have the goods.

1280
01:04:34,647 --> 01:04:36,746
And we don't have
any competition.

1281
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:38,782
There's dozens
of stories in here.

1282
01:04:38,784 --> 01:04:41,753
<i>The Times</i> has barely
scratched the surface.

1283
01:04:41,755 --> 01:04:44,925
We have ten hours
'til the deadline...

1284
01:04:45,324 --> 01:04:47,360
so we dig in.

1285
01:04:50,764 --> 01:04:53,030
I think this memo's
from McNamara.

1286
01:04:53,032 --> 01:04:54,598
"It is my belief
that there should be

1287
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,433
"a three- or four-week pause
in bombing."

1288
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:58,570
Wait, wait, wait. I saw
the other half of that memo.

1289
01:04:58,572 --> 01:05:01,938
Anyone have the back half of
a cable from Dulles in '54?

1290
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,842
I thought I saw one from July.

1291
01:05:03,844 --> 01:05:06,143
Yeah, here it is. "The reasons
for this belief...

1292
01:05:06,145 --> 01:05:08,045
"are that we must
lay a foundation

1293
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:09,480
"in the mind
of the American public."

1294
01:05:09,482 --> 01:05:11,451
That's it! That's it!

1295
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,418
So Johnson wasn't trying
to make peace.

1296
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:15,719
He was just
manipulating the public?

1297
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:18,723
Eyes out for a suspension
in bombing from when?

1298
01:05:18,725 --> 01:05:20,324
'65 to '68.

1299
01:05:20,326 --> 01:05:21,659
What about a memo

1300
01:05:21,661 --> 01:05:25,029
from Eisenhower's special
committee on Indochina?

1301
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:26,130
Uh, Meg read
a part of one to me.

1302
01:05:26,132 --> 01:05:27,197
Meg?

1303
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:28,431
Anybody see a mention

1304
01:05:28,433 --> 01:05:29,666
of the RAND Viet Cong study?

1305
01:05:29,668 --> 01:05:32,002
Yeah, I think this might be
from your RAND study.

1306
01:05:32,004 --> 01:05:33,570
"VC are deeply committed.

1307
01:05:33,572 --> 01:05:35,605
"South Vietnam
is a lost cause."

1308
01:05:35,607 --> 01:05:37,608
- Whoa! There you go.
- Bingo.

1309
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:39,110
- All right.
- Meg, I need the...

1310
01:05:39,112 --> 01:05:40,244
Yeah,
I put it on the shelf.

1311
01:05:40,246 --> 01:05:42,913
Couple of piles.
We're getting somewhere.

1312
01:05:42,915 --> 01:05:45,715
All right, it's 1:30.
Four o'clock story conference.

1313
01:05:45,717 --> 01:05:47,851
Can I interest anyone
in some lemonade?

1314
01:05:47,853 --> 01:05:49,554
- Yes!
- Does it have vodka in it?

1315
01:05:49,556 --> 01:05:51,054
I don't put vodka
in my lemonade.

1316
01:05:51,056 --> 01:05:52,155
Go easy on the kid.

1317
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,491
Why not?

1318
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:54,824
- How much, sweetheart?
- A quarter.

1319
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:55,893
It's 50 cents.

1320
01:05:55,895 --> 01:05:57,997
- Inflation.
- Price is going up.

1321
01:06:01,366 --> 01:06:02,967
Mr. Bradlee.

1322
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:04,268
Roger Clark.

1323
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:06,369
Oh, you're Roger Clark?

1324
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:08,271
It's nice to
meet you in person.

1325
01:06:08,273 --> 01:06:11,875
You are our
senior legal counsel.

1326
01:06:11,877 --> 01:06:13,844
Yes, we've spoken
on the phone.

1327
01:06:13,846 --> 01:06:15,545
My voice should
sound familiar.

1328
01:06:15,547 --> 01:06:18,382
When did you
finish law school?

1329
01:06:18,384 --> 01:06:20,784
- I graduated...
- Rhetorical question.

1330
01:06:20,786 --> 01:06:22,920
You know,
the guy we had before you

1331
01:06:22,922 --> 01:06:24,889
is now Secretary of State.

1332
01:06:24,891 --> 01:06:27,690
I did not know that.

1333
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,627
A little joke,
perhaps not the time.

1334
01:06:29,629 --> 01:06:31,228
What exactly
can I help you with...

1335
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:34,063
So, why would the CIA Director
send a memo on war policy?

1336
01:06:34,065 --> 01:06:35,933
Because they weren't
calling it a war yet.

1337
01:06:35,935 --> 01:06:37,969
Okay, I've got
turkey with mustard.

1338
01:06:37,971 --> 01:06:39,237
Roast beef with horseradish.

1339
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:41,771
- Howard, come look at this.
- Chal, you've gotta see this.

1340
01:06:41,773 --> 01:06:44,074
It's a full analysis
of McNamara's

1341
01:06:44,076 --> 01:06:45,143
changing view of the war.

1342
01:06:45,145 --> 01:06:46,543
Does it say anything
about why he does?

1343
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:48,279
So we knew they were
gonna assassinate Diem.

1344
01:06:48,281 --> 01:06:49,779
Yeah, and we did
nothing to stop it.

1345
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:51,616
I think I got something
on McNamara on the fireplace.

1346
01:06:51,618 --> 01:06:53,384
The other fireplace.

1347
01:06:54,754 --> 01:06:56,520
Murrey, where's
the back half of this one?

1348
01:06:56,522 --> 01:06:58,090
What's the thing
you just gave me?

1349
01:06:59,426 --> 01:07:01,092
Tell me these aren't
the classified documents

1350
01:07:01,094 --> 01:07:02,525
from the McNamara study.

1351
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,329
4,000 pages of 'em.

1352
01:07:04,331 --> 01:07:07,197
- Hungry?
- I need to use a phone.

1353
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:09,299
There's one in the other room.

1354
01:07:09,301 --> 01:07:10,534
- Two.
- Is that it?

1355
01:07:10,536 --> 01:07:11,969
This is it. This is it.

1356
01:07:11,971 --> 01:07:13,436
Hmm?

1357
01:07:13,438 --> 01:07:15,271
This is
the other half of it.

1358
01:07:26,485 --> 01:07:28,654
Oh, my God.

1359
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:59,583
Hi. Thanks for
letting me drop by.

1360
01:07:59,585 --> 01:08:01,918
- Marg still napping?
- Yeah.

1361
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,587
Do you mind
if we talk in the sunroom?

1362
01:08:03,589 --> 01:08:05,023
Just so I can hear her
if she wakes.

1363
01:08:05,025 --> 01:08:06,958
No, of course not.
I can't stay long.

1364
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,659
I've got a big event
at the house later.

1365
01:08:08,661 --> 01:08:11,630
I guess you've read
everything now.

1366
01:08:12,364 --> 01:08:14,331
Yes, I have. I have, yes.

1367
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,502
And I went over it
again this morning.

1368
01:08:16,902 --> 01:08:18,505
All of it.

1369
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,073
And I just...

1370
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:26,979
Forgive me, Bob, I know you're
dealing with so much...

1371
01:08:28,648 --> 01:08:32,682
but it's just so hard to try
to make sense of why.

1372
01:08:32,684 --> 01:08:35,319
Of how you could have done
all these things.

1373
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:37,254
How you could
just lie to us all.

1374
01:08:37,256 --> 01:08:41,858
Well, it's easy for the papers
to characterize us as liars.

1375
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,094
We were just trying to
push back...

1376
01:08:44,096 --> 01:08:46,330
No, but you let it
go on and on and on.

1377
01:08:46,332 --> 01:08:49,232
My son is home now and safe,
thank God.

1378
01:08:49,234 --> 01:08:50,968
But you watched him go.

1379
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,335
You knew
we couldn't win over there...

1380
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:55,708
for years and years and years,
and yet you let me...

1381
01:08:56,943 --> 01:09:00,076
you let so many of our friends
send our boys off.

1382
01:09:00,078 --> 01:09:02,946
Kay, we were doing
the best we could.

1383
01:09:02,948 --> 01:09:06,249
It was domino theory,
containment...

1384
01:09:06,251 --> 01:09:07,785
and eventually we felt

1385
01:09:07,787 --> 01:09:09,719
that military pressure
was the only thing...

1386
01:09:09,721 --> 01:09:11,688
that was gonna drive
Ho Chi Minh to the table.

1387
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,456
Our decision-making
process was...

1388
01:09:13,458 --> 01:09:15,095
Flawed.

1389
01:09:19,832 --> 01:09:23,136
It was flawed.
That's what your study said.

1390
01:09:24,938 --> 01:09:26,172
Yes.

1391
01:09:28,241 --> 01:09:33,279
I do believe that you were
trying to do your best...

1392
01:09:34,247 --> 01:09:36,781
and I know
how difficult it can be

1393
01:09:36,783 --> 01:09:39,049
to make choices that will...

1394
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:41,684
That's kind of you.

1395
01:09:41,686 --> 01:09:45,324
Well, what comes next
might not be so kind.

1396
01:09:47,393 --> 01:09:49,459
You have the papers.

1397
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:52,795
Let's just say...

1398
01:09:52,797 --> 01:09:56,335
I may have
a big decision to make.

1399
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:03,206
They will
argue it's a violation

1400
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:04,307
of the Espionage Act.

1401
01:10:04,309 --> 01:10:05,541
That is a felony, Ben.

1402
01:10:05,543 --> 01:10:07,477
That's only
if the documents we print

1403
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:08,812
could damage
the United States.

1404
01:10:08,814 --> 01:10:10,647
There's a federal judge
in New York

1405
01:10:10,649 --> 01:10:11,815
who seems to think
that they could.

1406
01:10:11,817 --> 01:10:13,116
Well, I've got
six seasoned journalists

1407
01:10:13,118 --> 01:10:14,418
in the next room...

1408
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,053
who've been reporting on this
war for the last ten years...

1409
01:10:16,055 --> 01:10:18,188
and I'll lay odds that they
have a better idea...

1410
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:19,690
of what could damage
the United States

1411
01:10:19,692 --> 01:10:20,825
than some judge...

1412
01:10:20,827 --> 01:10:22,092
who is just now wading

1413
01:10:22,094 --> 01:10:23,826
into this territory
for the first time.

1414
01:10:23,828 --> 01:10:26,263
"Wading." Is that a metaphor
for Vietnam?

1415
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:29,232
Okay. Ben, look, we know
your reporters are talented.

1416
01:10:29,234 --> 01:10:31,535
But <i>The New York Times</i>
spent three months

1417
01:10:31,537 --> 01:10:33,570
going over these documents.

1418
01:10:33,572 --> 01:10:35,405
You've got, what,
seven hours now

1419
01:10:35,407 --> 01:10:36,740
until the paper goes to press?

1420
01:10:36,742 --> 01:10:39,142
Can you honestly tell me
that that is enough time...

1421
01:10:39,144 --> 01:10:43,214
to make sure
not a single military plan,

1422
01:10:43,216 --> 01:10:44,347
not a single U.S. soldier...

1423
01:10:44,349 --> 01:10:47,250
not a single American life
will be put in harm's way?

1424
01:10:47,252 --> 01:10:48,852
That this will do no damage

1425
01:10:48,854 --> 01:10:51,088
to the United States
if you publish?

1426
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:52,125
Yes.

1427
01:10:54,327 --> 01:10:55,860
You're sure about that?

1428
01:10:55,862 --> 01:10:56,826
No!

1429
01:10:56,828 --> 01:11:00,063
That's why
I've called you guys.

1430
01:11:00,065 --> 01:11:02,599
<i>Look, Kay, I know
why</i> The Times <i>ran the story</i>

1431
01:11:02,601 --> 01:11:04,201
<i>but you need to understand...</i>

1432
01:11:04,203 --> 01:11:05,669
the study was for posterity.

1433
01:11:05,671 --> 01:11:07,839
It was written for academics
in the future...

1434
01:11:07,841 --> 01:11:09,639
and right now we're still
in the middle of the war.

1435
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:11,208
The papers can't be objective.

1436
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:13,643
And I suppose the public
has a right to know...

1437
01:11:13,645 --> 01:11:15,913
but I would prefer
that the study

1438
01:11:15,915 --> 01:11:17,347
not be made
widely available...

1439
01:11:17,349 --> 01:11:20,418
until it can be read with some
perspective. You understand.

1440
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,052
Mmm.

1441
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:27,325
We've been through a lot,
haven't we?

1442
01:11:27,327 --> 01:11:30,761
You and Marg
were there for me...

1443
01:11:30,763 --> 01:11:32,963
at the lowest point
of my life.

1444
01:11:32,965 --> 01:11:36,566
You helped me, you selected
my entire board...

1445
01:11:36,568 --> 01:11:39,236
you're my most
trusted advisor...

1446
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:40,839
my dear friend.

1447
01:11:41,774 --> 01:11:45,241
But my feelings about that
and about you...

1448
01:11:45,243 --> 01:11:48,946
can't be part of this decision
to publish or not.

1449
01:11:48,948 --> 01:11:53,517
I'm here
asking your advice, Bob...

1450
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:56,253
not your permission.

1451
01:11:56,255 --> 01:11:59,222
Well, then as one of your
most trusted advisors...

1452
01:11:59,224 --> 01:12:01,526
and someone who knows how much
you care about this company...

1453
01:12:01,528 --> 01:12:02,659
I'm worried, Kay.

1454
01:12:02,661 --> 01:12:04,195
I worked in Washington
for ten years,

1455
01:12:04,197 --> 01:12:05,663
I've seen
these people up close.

1456
01:12:05,665 --> 01:12:07,964
Bobby and Lyndon,
they were tough customers,

1457
01:12:07,966 --> 01:12:10,066
but Nixon is different.

1458
01:12:10,068 --> 01:12:12,303
He's got some real bad
people around him.

1459
01:12:12,305 --> 01:12:14,539
And if you publish he'll
get the very worst of them.

1460
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:15,772
The Colsons
and the Ehrlichmans

1461
01:12:15,774 --> 01:12:16,906
and he'll crush you.

1462
01:12:16,908 --> 01:12:18,275
I know he's just awful,
but I...

1463
01:12:18,277 --> 01:12:21,145
Nixon's a son of a bitch!
He hates you.

1464
01:12:21,147 --> 01:12:22,146
He hates Ben.

1465
01:12:22,148 --> 01:12:23,312
He's wanted to ruin
the paper for years...

1466
01:12:23,314 --> 01:12:26,116
and you will not get
a second chance, Kay.

1467
01:12:26,118 --> 01:12:28,017
The Richard Nixon I know
will muster

1468
01:12:28,019 --> 01:12:29,687
the full power
of the presidency...

1469
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:31,688
and if there's a way
to destroy your paper,

1470
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:33,992
by God, he'll find it.

1471
01:12:36,461 --> 01:12:38,829
Publish information
that harms national security.

1472
01:12:38,831 --> 01:12:40,062
I told you,
there is nothing in there.

1473
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,965
If there is, the paper
will be prosecuted.

1474
01:12:41,967 --> 01:12:43,599
Isn't that why you're here?

1475
01:12:43,601 --> 01:12:45,035
Yes, Ben, but if we lose...

1476
01:12:45,037 --> 01:12:46,771
With what we pay you,
you really shouldn't lose.

1477
01:12:46,773 --> 01:12:47,838
Ben, you need
to listen to them.

1478
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,972
Hey, Fritz.
Good to see you.

1479
01:12:48,974 --> 01:12:50,039
This is about
the future of the company

1480
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:51,342
and ensuring there is one.

1481
01:12:51,344 --> 01:12:53,576
That's a little melodramatic,
don't you think?

1482
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:54,977
Melodramatic?
You're talking about

1483
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:58,081
exposing years
of government secrets.

1484
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:00,717
I can't imagine they're
gonna take that lightly.

1485
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,252
You could jeopardize
the public offering.

1486
01:13:02,254 --> 01:13:04,388
You could jeopardize
our television stations.

1487
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:06,522
You know a felon can't
hold a broadcast license.

1488
01:13:06,524 --> 01:13:08,558
You think I give two shits
about the television stations?

1489
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,625
You should.
They make a hell of

1490
01:13:09,627 --> 01:13:10,895
a lot more money
than you do...

1491
01:13:10,897 --> 01:13:13,196
and without that revenue
we'll be forced to sell.

1492
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:15,264
If the government wins
and we're convicted...

1493
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:18,134
<i>The Washington Post</i> as we
know it will cease to exist.

1494
01:13:18,136 --> 01:13:19,837
If we live in a world
where the government

1495
01:13:19,839 --> 01:13:21,605
can tell us what we can
and cannot print...

1496
01:13:21,607 --> 01:13:22,807
then <i>The Washington Post</i>
as we know it

1497
01:13:22,809 --> 01:13:25,110
has already ceased to exist.

1498
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:28,014
What if we wait?

1499
01:13:28,881 --> 01:13:30,981
What if we hold off
on printing today

1500
01:13:30,983 --> 01:13:33,383
and instead we call
the Attorney General...

1501
01:13:33,385 --> 01:13:36,152
and we tell him that
we intend to print on Sunday?

1502
01:13:36,154 --> 01:13:37,855
That way we give
them and us time

1503
01:13:37,857 --> 01:13:40,090
to figure out
the legality of all of it...

1504
01:13:40,092 --> 01:13:42,593
while the court in New York
decides <i>The Times'</i> case.

1505
01:13:42,595 --> 01:13:45,062
You're suggesting we alert
the Attorney General...

1506
01:13:45,064 --> 01:13:47,330
to the fact that we
have these documents...

1507
01:13:47,332 --> 01:13:50,236
that we're going to print
in a few days?

1508
01:13:53,805 --> 01:13:57,007
Well, yes, that is the idea.

1509
01:13:57,009 --> 01:13:58,608
Yeah, well...

1510
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:00,076
outside of
landing the Hindenburg

1511
01:14:00,078 --> 01:14:01,445
in a lightning storm...

1512
01:14:01,447 --> 01:14:03,746
that's about the shittiest
idea I've ever heard.

1513
01:14:03,748 --> 01:14:05,117
Oh, boy.

1514
01:14:12,724 --> 01:14:14,724
Oh, here's
the man of the hour.

1515
01:14:14,726 --> 01:14:16,459
Kay.

1516
01:14:16,461 --> 01:14:17,695
For you.

1517
01:14:17,697 --> 01:14:18,795
I'm found.

1518
01:14:18,797 --> 01:14:20,097
Thank you, Kay.

1519
01:14:20,099 --> 01:14:21,263
You didn't have to
go through all this trouble.

1520
01:14:21,265 --> 01:14:22,598
No, we had to turn them
away at the door.

1521
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,733
Didn't we, dear?

1522
01:14:23,735 --> 01:14:24,867
- Thanks.
- Oh.

1523
01:14:24,869 --> 01:14:27,036
- Gene.
- Mrs. Graham.

1524
01:14:27,038 --> 01:14:29,272
So, everything okay?

1525
01:14:29,274 --> 01:14:32,541
Uh, it's gotten pretty hot
over at Ben's house.

1526
01:14:32,543 --> 01:14:34,945
Oh, things are
not going well?

1527
01:14:34,947 --> 01:14:38,816
No. Ben and Mr. Beebe
are at real loggerheads.

1528
01:14:38,818 --> 01:14:40,883
Fritz and Ben
on opposite sides?

1529
01:14:40,885 --> 01:14:41,985
I made a commitment
to publish these papers.

1530
01:14:41,987 --> 01:14:43,286
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1531
01:14:43,288 --> 01:14:45,022
The whole staff will revolt,
if we don't publish.

1532
01:14:45,024 --> 01:14:47,557
Meg, I hardly think
people are gonna resign.

1533
01:14:47,559 --> 01:14:48,691
Enjoying the fight?

1534
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:50,093
Yeah, who's winning?

1535
01:14:50,095 --> 01:14:52,195
- Nixon.
- I didn't see him come in.

1536
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:55,134
Really? He's got his hand
so far up Fritz's ass.

1537
01:14:56,501 --> 01:14:57,903
Where is Fritz?

1538
01:15:00,005 --> 01:15:02,672
That is not at all
what I'm saying. No.

1539
01:15:02,674 --> 01:15:04,540
Not in so many words,
but you're a bunch of lawyers.

1540
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,409
Will you cut through the shit!

1541
01:15:05,411 --> 01:15:06,776
Is the profanity necessary?

1542
01:15:06,778 --> 01:15:07,878
If we're not gonna publish,

1543
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,847
why are we busting
our rear ends, Ben?

1544
01:15:09,849 --> 01:15:11,615
Just keep writing.

1545
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:15,285
Can you stop
playing <i>Chopsticks?</i>

1546
01:15:15,287 --> 01:15:17,657
We're not gonna get it wrong!

1547
01:15:20,193 --> 01:15:22,061
What's up there, Fritz?

1548
01:15:22,595 --> 01:15:24,928
Calling Kay.

1549
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:27,998
I'm sorry, Ben.
I know you want this.

1550
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,601
There will be another one.

1551
01:15:30,603 --> 01:15:32,968
Like hell there will be.

1552
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,804
Given the
sensitive circumstances...

1553
01:15:34,806 --> 01:15:36,406
Sensitive circumstances?
Really?

1554
01:15:36,408 --> 01:15:38,075
How would you describe it?

1555
01:15:38,077 --> 01:15:41,044
Uh, well,
we're trying to make a story.

1556
01:15:41,046 --> 01:15:43,580
<i>Hello. Hello, I'm
making a telephone call.</i>

1557
01:15:43,582 --> 01:15:45,382
Yeah, well, it's my house.

1558
01:15:45,384 --> 01:15:48,084
- So I'll be on the call.
- <i>All right, Ben.</i>

1559
01:15:48,086 --> 01:15:52,722
I just want to thank you all
for coming out this evening...

1560
01:15:52,724 --> 01:15:55,659
to help me launch
Harry Gladstein...

1561
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:57,828
and his new sailboat...

1562
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:00,265
into the Chesapeake Bay.

1563
01:16:01,867 --> 01:16:05,436
And into his
very well earned retirement.

1564
01:16:05,438 --> 01:16:07,538
Let me just tell you
a little bit about

1565
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,940
why I'm so wild about Harry.

1566
01:16:09,942 --> 01:16:12,942
Mrs. Graham.
It's Mr. Beebe on the phone.

1567
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:16,013
In 1949, wasn't it?

1568
01:16:16,015 --> 01:16:19,682
Uh, Phil Graham first brought
Harry to the company.

1569
01:16:19,684 --> 01:16:22,652
- I'm afraid they need you now.
- And I remember, he told me...

1570
01:16:22,654 --> 01:16:23,954
Mrs. Graham.

1571
01:16:23,956 --> 01:16:25,558
They need you now.

1572
01:16:27,893 --> 01:16:31,195
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.

1573
01:16:31,197 --> 01:16:33,129
- Forgive me, Harry.
- Yeah.

1574
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:35,097
I think I'll have to suspend.

1575
01:16:35,099 --> 01:16:37,433
Well, you're paying
the overtime.

1576
01:16:37,435 --> 01:16:39,803
I'll be right back.

1577
01:16:39,805 --> 01:16:41,541
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Graham.

1578
01:16:41,907 --> 01:16:43,374
Yeah.

1579
01:16:43,376 --> 01:16:44,642
We should wait.

1580
01:16:44,644 --> 01:16:48,381
Yeah, I understand, Ben,
but if you wait a day...

1581
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,215
- Fritz on the phone for me?
- We should be on this call.

1582
01:16:52,217 --> 01:16:54,550
Well, there's an extension
in the living room.

1583
01:16:54,552 --> 01:16:57,622
Liz, show them where, please?
Thank you.

1584
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,031
Hello, Fritz?

1585
01:17:09,033 --> 01:17:11,434
Hello, Kay. Would you like me
to catch you up?

1586
01:17:11,436 --> 01:17:12,770
I say we can,
he says we can't.

1587
01:17:12,772 --> 01:17:13,904
There, you're caught up.

1588
01:17:13,906 --> 01:17:15,539
<i>- Ben...
- Hello, it's Art.</i>

1589
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:18,275
<i>Well, Ben,
there are concerns here</i>

1590
01:17:18,277 --> 01:17:20,309
<i>that are frankly
above your pay grade.</i>

1591
01:17:20,311 --> 01:17:22,045
<i>Well, there's
a few above yours, Art,</i>

1592
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,414
<i>like fucking freedom
of the press.</i>

1593
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:25,316
Let's just be civil if we can.

1594
01:17:25,318 --> 01:17:27,349
<i>Do you think
Nixon is going to be civil?</i>

1595
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:30,087
He is trying to censor the
goddamn <i>New York Times.</i>

1596
01:17:30,089 --> 01:17:31,821
Yes, <i>The Times</i>, not <i>The Post.</i>

1597
01:17:31,823 --> 01:17:33,456
<i>It's the same damn thing.</i>

1598
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:37,427
<i>This is an historic fight.
If they lose, we lose.</i>

1599
01:17:37,429 --> 01:17:39,295
<i>Hello? Is someone
on the phone?</i>

1600
01:17:39,297 --> 01:17:40,731
<i>This is Phil.</i>

1601
01:17:40,733 --> 01:17:42,365
Is that Phil Geyelin?

1602
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,602
<i>Uh, yes, Mrs. Graham.</i>

1603
01:17:44,604 --> 01:17:47,170
Good. I'd like you to weigh in
if you would...

1604
01:17:47,172 --> 01:17:48,370
because I wanna know

1605
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,507
what the staff
is feeling about this.

1606
01:17:50,509 --> 01:17:53,276
<i>Uh, well,
frankly Mrs. Graham...</i>

1607
01:17:53,278 --> 01:17:55,279
<i>Ben Bagdikian and Chal Roberts</i>

1608
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:58,013
<i>have, uh, both
threatened to resign...</i>

1609
01:17:58,015 --> 01:18:00,183
<i>if we don't publish, that is.</i>

1610
01:18:00,185 --> 01:18:01,651
Come on, Kay,
what do you expect?

1611
01:18:01,653 --> 01:18:02,518
<i>They got nothing to lose.</i>

1612
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,120
Due respect,
we all have everything

1613
01:18:04,122 --> 01:18:05,522
to lose if we don't publish.

1614
01:18:05,524 --> 01:18:08,392
What will happen to the
reputation of this paper?

1615
01:18:08,394 --> 01:18:10,593
Everyone will find out
we had the study.

1616
01:18:10,595 --> 01:18:12,629
<i>Hell, I bet half the town
knows already.</i>

1617
01:18:12,631 --> 01:18:14,798
<i>What will it look like
if we sit on our asses?</i>

1618
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,400
It'll look like
we were prudent.

1619
01:18:16,402 --> 01:18:18,134
<i>It will look like
we were afraid!</i>

1620
01:18:18,136 --> 01:18:21,271
We will lose! The country
will lose! Nixon wins!

1621
01:18:21,273 --> 01:18:23,139
Nixon wins this one,
and the next one...

1622
01:18:23,141 --> 01:18:25,107
and all the ones after that,
because we were scared.

1623
01:18:25,109 --> 01:18:26,375
Because the only way to assert

1624
01:18:26,377 --> 01:18:28,648
the right to publish
is to publish.

1625
01:18:33,452 --> 01:18:34,651
Fritz.

1626
01:18:34,653 --> 01:18:36,855
Is Fritz there?

1627
01:18:38,689 --> 01:18:41,090
Fritz, are you on?

1628
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:43,095
<i>I'm here, Kay.</i>

1629
01:18:45,864 --> 01:18:48,100
What do you think?

1630
01:18:49,367 --> 01:18:52,538
What do you think I should do?

1631
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:56,507
<i>I think...</i>

1632
01:18:56,509 --> 01:18:59,442
<i>there are arguments
on both sides.</i>

1633
01:18:59,444 --> 01:19:00,446
Yeah.

1634
01:19:02,948 --> 01:19:05,151
But I guess
I wouldn't publish.

1635
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,540
Let's go.
Let's do it.

1636
01:19:30,542 --> 01:19:34,779
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.
Let's publish.

1637
01:19:38,884 --> 01:19:40,616
- What?
- Phil?

1638
01:19:40,618 --> 01:19:42,287
What'd she say?

1639
01:19:42,955 --> 01:19:44,524
We go.

1640
01:19:46,224 --> 01:19:48,291
She says, we publish.

1641
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,427
- Hot damn.
- My God.

1642
01:19:50,429 --> 01:19:52,228
- Holy shit.
- Let's get this out.

1643
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:54,197
Holy shit.

1644
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:55,465
- I need that, Meg.
- Sorry.

1645
01:19:55,467 --> 01:19:56,733
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold your horses.

1646
01:19:56,735 --> 01:19:57,968
- I need the notes!
- Sorry.

1647
01:19:57,970 --> 01:19:59,335
- How many pages is it?
- 13.

1648
01:19:59,337 --> 01:20:00,971
We got two hours to get it
to the composing room.

1649
01:20:00,973 --> 01:20:03,139
I got it! Almost!
Wait one moment. I'm typing.

1650
01:20:03,141 --> 01:20:04,609
All right.

1651
01:20:05,577 --> 01:20:06,910
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Who's taking it?

1652
01:20:06,912 --> 01:20:08,078
I got it.

1653
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,245
Call National desk.

1654
01:20:09,247 --> 01:20:10,880
Tell them Bagdikian
is coming with the story.

1655
01:20:10,882 --> 01:20:12,214
Done!

1656
01:20:12,216 --> 01:20:13,983
All right.
Get it in the paper.

1657
01:20:13,985 --> 01:20:15,486
Editorial meeting.

1658
01:20:15,488 --> 01:20:18,053
- Ben?
- Yeah? Thanks.

1659
01:20:18,055 --> 01:20:20,324
Good job, Murrey.

1660
01:20:26,832 --> 01:20:29,098
- That it?
- That's it.

1661
01:20:39,244 --> 01:20:41,680
You... You got half an hour.

1662
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:55,124
I'm not sure how much thought

1663
01:20:55,126 --> 01:20:56,825
you've put
into this decision...

1664
01:20:56,827 --> 01:20:57,761
but we still have time.

1665
01:20:57,763 --> 01:20:59,596
The print deadline
is not 'til midnight.

1666
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:01,731
I know when the
print deadline is.

1667
01:21:01,733 --> 01:21:03,700
Look, I'm still learning
how to do this,

1668
01:21:03,702 --> 01:21:05,302
but everything
I know about business...

1669
01:21:05,304 --> 01:21:07,803
tells me you're making
a serious mistake here.

1670
01:21:07,805 --> 01:21:09,672
One that will cost you
and your paper dearly,

1671
01:21:09,674 --> 01:21:11,674
and hurt every person
gathered here.

1672
01:21:11,676 --> 01:21:14,444
Not to mention, the hundreds
of others who work for you.

1673
01:21:14,446 --> 01:21:16,446
I'm just trying to put
my thoughts together.

1674
01:21:16,448 --> 01:21:19,014
Kay, all I want is
what is best

1675
01:21:19,016 --> 01:21:20,950
for you and your business.

1676
01:21:20,952 --> 01:21:23,852
But I just got off the phone
with a couple of bankers...

1677
01:21:23,854 --> 01:21:26,990
and they think it's possible,
likely even...

1678
01:21:26,992 --> 01:21:29,625
that a number of their
institutional investors...

1679
01:21:29,627 --> 01:21:31,727
will pull out
if you go ahead and publish.

1680
01:21:31,729 --> 01:21:35,267
And if they pull out, Kay...

1681
01:21:36,201 --> 01:21:38,604
You got a couple of hours.

1682
01:21:39,037 --> 01:21:40,270
For your sake,

1683
01:21:40,272 --> 01:21:42,438
and for the sake of every one
of your employees...

1684
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,376
I hope you will reconsider.

1685
01:21:51,783 --> 01:21:53,518
Give me the canister.

1686
01:21:59,091 --> 01:22:00,257
Get it downstairs...

1687
01:22:00,259 --> 01:22:02,125
and I want the page editor
standing over Lino

1688
01:22:02,127 --> 01:22:03,660
'til they got it
ready to print.

1689
01:22:03,662 --> 01:22:04,664
Okay.

1690
01:22:08,233 --> 01:22:09,968
Mr. Bagdikian.

1691
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:17,706
I need to know your source.

1692
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:20,442
I thought I was clear earlier.

1693
01:22:20,444 --> 01:22:22,779
Well, we weren't
going to press earlier.

1694
01:22:22,781 --> 01:22:25,548
Yeah, well,
my answer's the same.

1695
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:27,584
"This action has been
commenced to enjoin

1696
01:22:27,586 --> 01:22:29,419
<i>"The New York Times</i>
and their agents...

1697
01:22:29,421 --> 01:22:31,221
"from further
disseminating or disclosing

1698
01:22:31,223 --> 01:22:32,621
"certain alleged
top secret documents."

1699
01:22:32,623 --> 01:22:34,691
Are you trying
to piss me off?

1700
01:22:34,693 --> 01:22:36,526
No. Not me.
Judge Gurfein.

1701
01:22:36,528 --> 01:22:38,460
If you look at the text
of his restraining order...

1702
01:22:38,462 --> 01:22:40,563
I read his restraining order.

1703
01:22:40,565 --> 01:22:42,566
So then you know that if
<i>The Times</i> was your source...

1704
01:22:42,568 --> 01:22:44,233
we would be in
direct violation...

1705
01:22:44,235 --> 01:22:47,170
I did not get the study
from <i>The Times.</i>

1706
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:48,373
You're sure?

1707
01:22:49,207 --> 01:22:50,776
We done?

1708
01:22:54,278 --> 01:22:56,748
Did you get it
from their source?

1709
01:23:03,689 --> 01:23:05,124
Excuse me?

1710
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:10,125
Did you get the study

1711
01:23:10,127 --> 01:23:12,797
from the same source
as <i>The Times?</i>

1712
01:23:15,134 --> 01:23:18,601
We do not reveal
our sources.

1713
01:23:18,603 --> 01:23:20,637
"This action has been
commenced to enjoin

1714
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,504
<i>"The New York Times</i>
and its agents..."

1715
01:23:22,506 --> 01:23:24,109
I get it!
I get it!

1716
01:23:27,645 --> 01:23:30,013
If you got the study
from the same source

1717
01:23:30,015 --> 01:23:31,748
that would
amount to collusion.

1718
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,854
Yeah, we could
all be executed at dawn.

1719
01:23:35,854 --> 01:23:38,989
And we could be held
in contempt of court...

1720
01:23:38,991 --> 01:23:42,728
which means Mr. Bradlee and
Mrs. Graham could go to jail.

1721
01:23:46,431 --> 01:23:48,466
Mr. Bagdikian...

1722
01:23:49,467 --> 01:23:52,936
how likely is it
that your source...

1723
01:23:52,938 --> 01:23:55,841
and <i>The Times</i> source
are the same person?

1724
01:23:57,442 --> 01:23:59,444
It's likely.

1725
01:24:00,946 --> 01:24:02,614
How likely?

1726
01:24:04,882 --> 01:24:06,682
Very.

1727
01:24:06,684 --> 01:24:08,754
- It's very likely.
- Yes.

1728
01:24:19,898 --> 01:24:22,065
What is all this?

1729
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:24,867
Lemonade earnings.

1730
01:24:24,869 --> 01:24:28,103
Marina wanted me to
put it away for safekeeping.

1731
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:29,442
Oh, wow.

1732
01:24:34,144 --> 01:24:35,980
We're publishing.

1733
01:24:39,684 --> 01:24:40,819
Wow.

1734
01:24:43,388 --> 01:24:45,824
I didn't think Kay'd do it.

1735
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,927
That's brave.

1736
01:24:50,929 --> 01:24:53,897
Well, she's not the only one
who's brave.

1737
01:24:53,899 --> 01:24:55,164
Oh.

1738
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:57,299
What have you got to lose?

1739
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:59,035
Uh, my job.

1740
01:24:59,037 --> 01:25:00,437
My reputation.

1741
01:25:00,439 --> 01:25:02,141
Oh, Ben, please.

1742
01:25:03,308 --> 01:25:05,441
We both know
this will do nothing

1743
01:25:05,443 --> 01:25:08,445
but burnish your reputation.

1744
01:25:08,447 --> 01:25:10,313
And as for your job...

1745
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:12,585
you can always
find another one.

1746
01:25:13,618 --> 01:25:16,852
Now, if you're trying to
make me feel better...

1747
01:25:16,854 --> 01:25:19,791
there's nicer ways
of doing it.

1748
01:25:21,225 --> 01:25:23,228
You're very brave.

1749
01:25:25,197 --> 01:25:27,830
But Kay...

1750
01:25:27,832 --> 01:25:32,369
Kay is in a position
she never thought she'd be in.

1751
01:25:32,371 --> 01:25:34,337
A position
I'm sure plenty of people

1752
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:37,106
don't think she should have.

1753
01:25:37,108 --> 01:25:39,409
And when you're told
time and time again

1754
01:25:39,411 --> 01:25:41,477
that you're not good enough.

1755
01:25:41,479 --> 01:25:44,947
That your opinion
doesn't matter as much.

1756
01:25:44,949 --> 01:25:48,651
When they don't
just look past you.

1757
01:25:48,653 --> 01:25:52,589
When, to them,
you're not even there.

1758
01:25:52,591 --> 01:25:54,757
When that's been your
reality for so long...

1759
01:25:54,759 --> 01:25:57,796
it's hard not to let
yourself think it's true.

1760
01:25:58,764 --> 01:26:01,998
So, to make this decision...

1761
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,733
to risk her fortune
and the company

1762
01:26:04,735 --> 01:26:07,206
that's been her entire life...

1763
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,775
well, I think that's brave.

1764
01:26:17,149 --> 01:26:18,014
Bradlee.

1765
01:26:18,016 --> 01:26:20,685
<i>Ben, we got a problem.</i>

1766
01:26:31,229 --> 01:26:33,098
You remember this?

1767
01:26:34,966 --> 01:26:37,034
- The day before the funeral.
- Yeah.

1768
01:26:37,036 --> 01:26:38,237
Wasn't it?

1769
01:26:39,004 --> 01:26:40,171
Yeah.

1770
01:26:41,707 --> 01:26:42,839
I didn't...

1771
01:26:42,841 --> 01:26:45,508
I didn't wanna do it...

1772
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:48,011
but Fritz said
I should go in...

1773
01:26:48,013 --> 01:26:50,716
and say a few words
to the Board.

1774
01:26:52,951 --> 01:26:55,951
So, I tried
to rehearse something...

1775
01:26:55,953 --> 01:26:58,321
but it all
turned out so awful,

1776
01:26:58,323 --> 01:26:59,556
and before I knew it...

1777
01:26:59,558 --> 01:27:01,223
the car was there
ready to take me

1778
01:27:01,225 --> 01:27:02,795
and then you came out.

1779
01:27:03,528 --> 01:27:05,261
I remember.

1780
01:27:05,263 --> 01:27:06,529
You came out in

1781
01:27:06,531 --> 01:27:08,964
your little nightgown
and your robe.

1782
01:27:08,966 --> 01:27:11,467
And you hopped
in the car with me.

1783
01:27:11,469 --> 01:27:14,070
Gave me this.

1784
01:27:14,072 --> 01:27:18,874
Somehow you managed to
scribble these notes for me.

1785
01:27:18,876 --> 01:27:22,145
So I'd know what to say.

1786
01:27:22,147 --> 01:27:25,115
But I don't
have my glasses up here.

1787
01:27:25,117 --> 01:27:27,749
- So, just read it for me.
- Mummy...

1788
01:27:27,751 --> 01:27:29,988
Oh, come on, just...
Would you read it to me?

1789
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:37,526
"One, thank them.

1790
01:27:37,528 --> 01:27:40,562
"Two, there has been a crisis,

1791
01:27:40,564 --> 01:27:42,499
"but you know
they will carry on.

1792
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:45,838
"Three, never expected
to be in this...

1793
01:27:47,072 --> 01:27:49,237
"situation.

1794
01:27:49,239 --> 01:27:54,578
"Four, going off to clear mind
and think about the future.

1795
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:57,147
"Five, no changes
at this time,

1796
01:27:57,149 --> 01:27:59,749
"paper will remain
in the family.

1797
01:27:59,751 --> 01:28:03,018
"And six, and be carried on
in the tradition...

1798
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:05,522
- "so well set."
- So well set.

1799
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:10,625
You know, I just wanted
to hold on to the company...

1800
01:28:10,627 --> 01:28:13,228
for you and Don
and Billy and Steve.

1801
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:15,130
You did. You have.

1802
01:28:15,132 --> 01:28:16,702
Well...

1803
01:28:18,836 --> 01:28:20,973
You know that quote?

1804
01:28:22,608 --> 01:28:24,039
That quote...

1805
01:28:24,041 --> 01:28:29,512
"A woman preaching is like a
dog walking on its hind legs.

1806
01:28:29,514 --> 01:28:31,112
"It's not done well...

1807
01:28:31,114 --> 01:28:35,787
"and you're surprised to see
it's done at all."

1808
01:28:36,587 --> 01:28:37,919
Samuel Johnson.

1809
01:28:37,921 --> 01:28:39,589
- Oh, Mummy.
- Yeah.

1810
01:28:39,591 --> 01:28:41,124
Well, it's a bunch
of nonsense.

1811
01:28:41,126 --> 01:28:44,363
No, but that's the way
we all thought then...

1812
01:28:45,129 --> 01:28:46,763
you know?

1813
01:28:46,765 --> 01:28:50,402
I was never
supposed to be in this job.

1814
01:28:52,069 --> 01:28:56,472
When my father chose your dad
to run the company...

1815
01:28:56,474 --> 01:28:59,174
I thought it was the most
natural thing in the world.

1816
01:28:59,176 --> 01:29:01,677
I was so proud,
because you know...

1817
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:05,717
Phil was so brilliant.
And he was...

1818
01:29:09,086 --> 01:29:11,920
so gifted...

1819
01:29:11,922 --> 01:29:14,857
But I thought that was the way
it was supposed to be.

1820
01:29:14,859 --> 01:29:17,962
Everybody thought
that way then.

1821
01:29:18,863 --> 01:29:21,467
And I was raising you kids...

1822
01:29:23,635 --> 01:29:27,803
and I was happy in my life.

1823
01:29:27,805 --> 01:29:30,108
The way it was.

1824
01:29:32,344 --> 01:29:36,081
But then when it
all fell apart, you know...

1825
01:29:39,951 --> 01:29:42,852
When Phil died, it was just...

1826
01:29:42,854 --> 01:29:46,222
I was 45 years old
and I had never held...

1827
01:29:46,224 --> 01:29:50,028
I'd never had to
hold a job in my life.

1828
01:29:51,996 --> 01:29:55,365
But I just, I loved the paper,
you know...

1829
01:29:55,367 --> 01:29:56,869
I do.

1830
01:29:57,635 --> 01:29:59,035
I do so love the paper.

1831
01:29:59,037 --> 01:30:01,169
I don't want it
to be my fault.

1832
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:02,540
I don't want
to be the one who...

1833
01:30:03,809 --> 01:30:08,011
I don't wanna
let Phil and my father...

1834
01:30:08,013 --> 01:30:11,416
and all of you kids
and everybody down.

1835
01:30:12,817 --> 01:30:14,453
Mrs. Graham?

1836
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:25,397
- You ran here?
- Yeah.

1837
01:30:27,098 --> 01:30:29,464
There's been a bit of a...

1838
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:31,068
complication.

1839
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,770
I didn't understand at first,

1840
01:30:33,772 --> 01:30:35,371
but now everything
is in a different light.

1841
01:30:35,373 --> 01:30:39,342
Our source might be the same
as <i>The New York Times.</i>

1842
01:30:39,344 --> 01:30:40,345
Okay.

1843
01:30:41,179 --> 01:30:44,112
If so, we could be
held in contempt.

1844
01:30:44,114 --> 01:30:45,882
Meaning?

1845
01:30:45,884 --> 01:30:48,287
Well, we could
all go to prison.

1846
01:30:51,022 --> 01:30:53,091
Now putting that aside...

1847
01:30:54,192 --> 01:30:57,229
Katharine,
I've come to realize...

1848
01:30:58,596 --> 01:31:01,567
just how much
you have at stake.

1849
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,460
- Paul.
- Glad you're here.

1850
01:31:31,462 --> 01:31:32,762
Fritz is sitting
with Mrs. Graham now.

1851
01:31:32,764 --> 01:31:33,830
And Ben is here.

1852
01:31:33,832 --> 01:31:35,868
Yes, I figured he would be.

1853
01:31:59,291 --> 01:32:00,656
Jesus Christ.

1854
01:32:00,658 --> 01:32:01,891
Mr. Bradlee, if you knew

1855
01:32:01,893 --> 01:32:03,025
Mr. Bagdikian
received the study...

1856
01:32:03,027 --> 01:32:04,326
from the same source
as <i>The Times</i>...

1857
01:32:04,328 --> 01:32:06,195
I didn't know because
I'm not in the habit...

1858
01:32:06,197 --> 01:32:07,830
of asking my reporters
who their sources are...

1859
01:32:07,832 --> 01:32:09,065
and if you'd spent any time

1860
01:32:09,067 --> 01:32:10,298
at a real goddamn newspaper
you'd know why.

1861
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:12,103
You understand he's trying
to help you, Ben?

1862
01:32:12,738 --> 01:32:14,606
Mrs. Graham, hi.

1863
01:32:15,306 --> 01:32:16,406
We can all...

1864
01:32:16,408 --> 01:32:19,107
We can all appreciate
why Ben wants to publish...

1865
01:32:19,109 --> 01:32:20,910
and if these papers had
come from someone else...

1866
01:32:20,912 --> 01:32:23,248
we might have been
able to skirt the issue.

1867
01:32:24,349 --> 01:32:25,914
Anything from
the folks upstairs?

1868
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:27,048
No.

1869
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:28,450
We gotta start the run

1870
01:32:28,452 --> 01:32:31,422
or we won't get
to the carriers on time.

1871
01:32:34,824 --> 01:32:36,392
I disagreed with you earlier,

1872
01:32:36,394 --> 01:32:38,227
but I thought it brave.
But this?

1873
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:39,829
If we were
to publish knowing this,

1874
01:32:39,831 --> 01:32:41,629
it would just
be irresponsible.

1875
01:32:41,631 --> 01:32:44,365
Fritz, do you agree?

1876
01:32:44,367 --> 01:32:46,803
Well, I don't particularly
like the idea

1877
01:32:46,805 --> 01:32:49,539
of Kay as a convicted felon.

1878
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:51,339
And then there's the
issue of the prospectus.

1879
01:32:51,341 --> 01:32:52,775
Based on
the conversations I've had

1880
01:32:52,777 --> 01:32:54,009
with my friends at Cravath...

1881
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:55,445
I believe
a criminal indictment

1882
01:32:55,447 --> 01:32:58,013
would qualify
as a catastrophic event.

1883
01:32:58,015 --> 01:33:01,219
And given the likelihood
of indictment now...

1884
01:33:02,787 --> 01:33:03,919
Kay, it could...

1885
01:33:03,921 --> 01:33:06,458
Yes, I understand.

1886
01:33:07,893 --> 01:33:11,160
We have a responsibility
to the company...

1887
01:33:11,162 --> 01:33:12,361
to all the employees

1888
01:33:12,363 --> 01:33:14,699
and to the long-term health
of the paper.

1889
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,135
Absolutely, Kay.

1890
01:33:20,171 --> 01:33:23,208
Yes. However, um...

1891
01:33:31,082 --> 01:33:33,482
The prospectus
also talks about...

1892
01:33:33,484 --> 01:33:36,553
the mission
of the paper, which is...

1893
01:33:36,555 --> 01:33:38,187
"outstanding news collection

1894
01:33:38,189 --> 01:33:40,190
"and reporting,"
isn't that right?

1895
01:33:40,192 --> 01:33:41,257
Yes.

1896
01:33:41,259 --> 01:33:42,157
And...

1897
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:44,759
And it also says...

1898
01:33:44,761 --> 01:33:45,962
that the newspaper will

1899
01:33:45,964 --> 01:33:48,197
"be dedicated to the welfare
of the nation...

1900
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:51,066
"and to the, uh, principles
of a free press..."

1901
01:33:51,068 --> 01:33:52,468
Yes, but...

1902
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:57,071
So, one could argue that the
bankers were put on notice.

1903
01:33:57,073 --> 01:33:59,508
But Kay, these are
extraordinary circumstances.

1904
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:02,512
Are they? Are they?
For a newspaper?

1905
01:34:02,514 --> 01:34:05,147
One that covers
the Nixon White House.

1906
01:34:05,149 --> 01:34:07,983
Can you guarantee me that
we could go to print...

1907
01:34:07,985 --> 01:34:09,817
without endangering
any of our soldiers?

1908
01:34:09,819 --> 01:34:11,254
You can't be considering...

1909
01:34:11,256 --> 01:34:13,792
I'm talking
to Mr. Bradlee now.

1910
01:34:17,627 --> 01:34:20,062
Fritz, you're not gonna
let her do this.

1911
01:34:20,064 --> 01:34:21,196
She can't go to...

1912
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:23,031
No, now, she can, Arthur.

1913
01:34:23,033 --> 01:34:24,467
And it's entirely
her decision.

1914
01:34:24,469 --> 01:34:27,137
Kay, you're allowing
Mr. Bradlee...

1915
01:34:27,139 --> 01:34:29,004
to lead you to folly.

1916
01:34:29,006 --> 01:34:30,638
The legacy of the company
is at stake

1917
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,209
and if you want
to protect that legacy...

1918
01:34:33,211 --> 01:34:35,044
This company's
been in my life...

1919
01:34:35,046 --> 01:34:36,210
for longer
than most of the people

1920
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:37,612
working there have been alive.

1921
01:34:37,614 --> 01:34:40,786
So, I don't need
the lecture on legacy.

1922
01:34:42,453 --> 01:34:46,522
And this is no longer
my father's company.

1923
01:34:46,524 --> 01:34:48,892
It's no longer
my husband's company.

1924
01:34:48,894 --> 01:34:51,026
It's my company.

1925
01:34:51,028 --> 01:34:52,928
And anyone
who thinks otherwise...

1926
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:56,132
probably doesn't belong
on my board.

1927
01:34:56,134 --> 01:34:58,401
Can you guarantee me
that we can go to...

1928
01:34:58,403 --> 01:34:59,701
100%!

1929
01:34:59,703 --> 01:35:02,004
All right, then.

1930
01:35:02,006 --> 01:35:04,408
My decision stands...

1931
01:35:06,978 --> 01:35:08,814
and I'm going to bed.

1932
01:35:24,828 --> 01:35:26,629
It's Ben Bradlee.
Run it.

1933
01:35:26,631 --> 01:35:27,830
Yes, sir.

1934
01:35:27,832 --> 01:35:29,501
Start it up.

1935
01:36:44,641 --> 01:36:48,244
Let's go! Let's go!

1936
01:36:48,246 --> 01:36:50,946
This is not a party,
this is a war here!

1937
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:05,628
I've got the
Assistant Attorney General.

1938
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:06,898
Put him on.

1939
01:37:08,099 --> 01:37:09,898
- Good morning.
<i>- Good morning.</i>

1940
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:10,967
<i>This is William Rehnquist</i>

1941
01:37:10,969 --> 01:37:13,268
<i>from the Office
of Legal Counsel at Justice.</i>

1942
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:14,570
Yes, sir.

1943
01:37:14,572 --> 01:37:16,405
<i>Mr. Bradlee,
I have been advised</i>

1944
01:37:16,407 --> 01:37:18,039
<i>by the Secretary of Defense...</i>

1945
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,407
<i>that the material published</i>

1946

<i>in</i> The Washington Post
<i>this morning...</i>

1947
01:37:21,311 --> 01:37:22,911
<i>contains information

1948
01:37:22,913 --> 01:37:25,313
<i>the national defense
of the United States...</i>

1949
01:37:25,315 --> 01:37:28,250
<i>and bears
a top-secret classification.</i>

1950
01:37:28,252 --> 01:37:30,919
<i>As such, the publication
of this information...</i>

1951
01:37:30,921 --> 01:37:33,656
<i>is directly prohibited by

1952
01:37:33,658 --> 01:37:38,393
<i>title 18 of the United States
code, section 793.</i>

1953
01:37:38,395 --> 01:37:40,862
<i>As publication will cause
irreparable injury...</i>

1954
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:43,833
<i>to the defense interests
of the United States...</i>

1955
01:37:43,835 --> 01:37:45,867
<i>I respectfully request
that you publish</i>

1956
01:37:45,869 --> 01:37:48,971
<i>no further information
of this character...</i>

1957
01:37:48,973 --> 01:37:51,740
<i>and advise me that you

1958
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:53,409
<i>for the return

1959
01:37:53,411 --> 01:37:55,477
<i>to the Department of Defense.</i>

1960
01:37:55,479 --> 01:37:57,580
Well, thank you for the call,
Mr. Rehnquist...

1961
01:37:57,582 --> 01:38:02,384
but I'm sure you understand
I must respectfully decline.

1962
01:38:02,386 --> 01:38:04,956
<i>I appreciate your time.</i>

1963
01:38:08,893 --> 01:38:10,125
What's next?

1964
01:38:10,127 --> 01:38:12,593
We're going to court. Today.

1965
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:15,798
If we get a ruling in our
favor, or <i>The Times</i> does...

1966
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:19,371
we'll be at the Supreme Court
sometime next week.

1967
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:31,681
No, I wanna make sure
all the dates

1968
01:38:31,683 --> 01:38:32,981
are locked down
between sixth...

1969
01:38:32,983 --> 01:38:34,385
We're focusing on Johnson...

1970
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,087
I don't want any more articles

1971
01:38:38,089 --> 01:38:39,858
just about shoes
and about dresses.

1972
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:42,724
Well, that's where
you're wrong, Al.

1973
01:38:42,726 --> 01:38:44,696
I happen to be
a woman and I know a few.

1974
01:38:46,596 --> 01:38:47,730
Your Honor,
the stories published

1975
01:38:47,732 --> 01:38:49,031
in <i>The Times</i>
and now <i>The Post</i>...

1976
01:38:49,033 --> 01:38:50,266
have created a diplomatic

1977
01:38:50,268 --> 01:38:52,434
and security disaster
for the United States.

1978
01:38:52,436 --> 01:38:55,705
How exactly have these papers
created a diplomatic disaster?

1979
01:38:55,707 --> 01:38:58,173
Why would other countries
talk to us in confidence...

1980
01:38:58,175 --> 01:38:59,709
if secrets like this
can be leaked?

1981
01:38:59,711 --> 01:39:01,142
So, does this
make it difficult

1982
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:02,544
for the President to govern?

1983
01:39:02,546 --> 01:39:05,347
If the President can't
keep secrets, he can't govern.

1984
01:39:05,349 --> 01:39:07,148
Nothing less
than the integrity

1985
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,754
of the presidency is at stake.

1986
01:39:10,188 --> 01:39:11,620
Yes, I know.

1987
01:39:11,622 --> 01:39:13,688
I'm sure it has
rattled investors, Jerry.

1988
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:16,191
That's why I'm calling you.

1989
01:39:16,193 --> 01:39:18,392
Yes, I understand
a number of them

1990
01:39:18,394 --> 01:39:21,098
have considered pulling out
but we feel...

1991
01:39:22,433 --> 01:39:26,371
Of course.
I stand behind the decision.

1992
01:39:31,576 --> 01:39:33,409
Well, you know,
one could argue

1993
01:39:33,411 --> 01:39:37,780
it's raising
the profile of <i>The Post.</i>

1994
01:39:37,782 --> 01:39:41,383
Would <i>The Post</i> have published
military plans for D-Day...

1995
01:39:41,385 --> 01:39:44,453
if they'd had them in advance?

1996
01:39:44,455 --> 01:39:46,821
Well, I don't think
there's any comparison

1997
01:39:46,823 --> 01:39:48,657
between a pending invasion
of Europe...

1998
01:39:48,659 --> 01:39:51,559
and a historical survey
of American involvement

1999
01:39:51,561 --> 01:39:53,131
in the Vietnam War.

2000
01:39:54,564 --> 01:39:56,264
<i>The Supreme Court has decided</i>

2001
01:39:56,266 --> 01:39:57,965
<i>to hold a hearing
tomorrow morning...</i>

2002
01:39:57,967 --> 01:40:01,236
<i>to resolve the tangle of
conflicting decisions...</i>

2003
01:40:01,238 --> 01:40:02,905
<i>over what
of the Pentagon Papers</i>

2004
01:40:02,907 --> 01:40:04,740
<i>can be published
and more broadly...</i>

2005
01:40:04,742 --> 01:40:06,374
<i>the issue
of freedom of the press</i>

2006
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:08,477
<i>versus government security.</i>

2007
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:09,911
<i>But in agreeing
to hear the cases of</i>

2008
01:40:09,913 --> 01:40:11,545
The New York Times
<i>and</i> The Washington Post...

2009
01:40:11,547 --> 01:40:14,548
Supreme's granted cert.

2010
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:16,050
Emergency expedited basis.

2011
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:18,022
We're in court
with <i>The Times</i> tomorrow.

2012
01:40:20,257 --> 01:40:22,126
What are you so happy about?

2013
01:40:27,866 --> 01:40:31,536
I always wanted to be part
of a small rebellion.

2014
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,646
<i>I asked him
what he considers...</i>

2015
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:45,313
<i>the most important revelations</i>

2016
01:40:45,315 --> 01:40:47,583
<i>to date
from the Pentagon documents.</i>

2017
01:40:47,585 --> 01:40:49,617
<i>I think the lesson is
the people of this country...</i>

2018
01:40:49,619 --> 01:40:51,352
<i>can't afford
to let the President</i>

2019
01:40:51,354 --> 01:40:53,556
<i>run the country by himself.</i>

2020
01:40:53,558 --> 01:40:56,057
<i>Even foreign affairs any more
than domestic affairs,</i>

2021
01:40:56,059 --> 01:40:57,625
<i>without the help of Congress.</i>

2022
01:40:57,627 --> 01:40:58,727
<i>I was struck, in fact,</i>

2023
01:40:58,729 --> 01:40:59,928
<i>by President Johnson's
reaction...</i>

2024
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:02,664
<i>to these revelations
as close to treason.</i>

2025
01:41:02,666 --> 01:41:04,599
<i>Because it reflected
to me the sense</i>

2026
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:07,169
<i>that what was damaging
to the reputation...</i>

2027
01:41:07,171 --> 01:41:08,736
<i>of a particular
administration,</i>

2028
01:41:08,738 --> 01:41:10,406
<i>a particular individual...</i>

2029
01:41:10,408 --> 01:41:12,641
<i>was in itself treason.</i>

2030
01:41:12,643 --> 01:41:15,747
<i>Which is very close to saying,
"I am the State."</i>

2031
01:41:21,984 --> 01:41:23,317
<i>But this is
a self-governing country.</i>

2032
01:41:23,319 --> 01:41:24,820
Ben?

2033
01:41:24,822 --> 01:41:27,656
<i>The Constitution provides
for a separation of powers...</i>

2034
01:41:27,658 --> 01:41:30,829
What on earth are you doing?

2035
01:41:46,109 --> 01:41:49,179
They all followed your lead
and published the papers.

2036
01:41:50,113 --> 01:41:52,483
At least we're not alone.

2037
01:41:53,283 --> 01:41:54,816
No matter
what happens tomorrow,

2038
01:41:54,818 --> 01:41:57,852
we are not
a little local paper anymore.

2039
01:41:57,854 --> 01:41:58,922
Hmm.

2040
01:42:11,536 --> 01:42:12,634
I'd be very interested
in your opinion.

2041
01:42:12,636 --> 01:42:13,968
Sounds good.

2042
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:15,169
All right, I'll see you
at the first break.

2043
01:42:15,171 --> 01:42:16,174
All right.

2044
01:42:18,141 --> 01:42:19,644
I am sorry.

2045
01:42:23,514 --> 01:42:25,313
Mrs. Graham,
there's an entrance

2046
01:42:25,315 --> 01:42:26,682
around the side
for the appellants.

2047
01:42:26,684 --> 01:42:28,086
Oh, thank you very much.

2048
01:42:29,485 --> 01:42:31,152
I'm sorry I'm walking so fast.

2049
01:42:31,154 --> 01:42:33,455
I was supposed to be here
half hour ago...

2050
01:42:33,457 --> 01:42:34,923
but then I had to
make copies of the brief

2051
01:42:34,925 --> 01:42:36,525
and there
was so much traffic...

2052
01:42:36,527 --> 01:42:37,625
and you just wouldn't think

2053
01:42:37,627 --> 01:42:38,861
there'd be all these people,
you know?

2054
01:42:38,863 --> 01:42:41,263
No, you wouldn't.
You work for Roger Clark then?

2055
01:42:41,265 --> 01:42:42,630
I work for the government.

2056
01:42:42,632 --> 01:42:44,700
The Solicitor
General's office.

2057
01:42:44,702 --> 01:42:46,401
Oh. You're on the other team.

2058
01:42:46,403 --> 01:42:47,604
Mrs. Graham...

2059
01:42:48,439 --> 01:42:51,440
I probably shouldn't say this.

2060
01:42:51,442 --> 01:42:54,746
My brother,
he's still over there and...

2061
01:42:58,114 --> 01:43:00,184
Well, I hope you win.

2062
01:43:01,585 --> 01:43:02,817
Besides, I like someone

2063
01:43:02,819 --> 01:43:04,453
telling these guys
what's what.

2064
01:43:04,455 --> 01:43:05,687
But don't tell my boss
I said that.

2065
01:43:05,689 --> 01:43:07,129
He'd fire me just
for talking to you.

2066
01:43:15,099 --> 01:43:16,598
- Ben.
- How are ya, kid?

2067
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,168
- Fritz.
- Roger.

2068
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:23,438
I told you
to be here at eight.

2069
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,505
Yes. I was here at eight,

2070
01:43:24,507 --> 01:43:25,673
but Richard
sent me back to make...

2071
01:43:25,675 --> 01:43:26,808
Is Richard your boss?

2072
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:28,777
No, but you weren't here so...

2073
01:43:28,779 --> 01:43:31,683
I don't want excuses.
Just take a seat.

2074
01:43:33,117 --> 01:43:34,249
Mrs. Graham.

2075
01:43:34,251 --> 01:43:35,320
Morning.

2076
01:43:38,689 --> 01:43:40,522
Morning, gentlemen.
Good to see you.

2077
01:43:40,524 --> 01:43:42,624
- Kay.
- Punch, Abe.

2078
01:43:42,626 --> 01:43:44,892
Nice to be on the same
side for a change.

2079
01:43:44,894 --> 01:43:46,495
I'll tell you what's nice...

2080
01:43:46,497 --> 01:43:50,398
making the front page of your
newspaper on a daily basis.

2081
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,300
Must be a lot of people
from Boston

2082
01:43:52,302 --> 01:43:54,037
to Washington
reading about us.

2083
01:43:54,505 --> 01:43:56,004
Yes...

2084
01:43:56,006 --> 01:43:58,673
well, I suppose
it's appropriate...

2085
01:43:58,675 --> 01:44:00,344
given what's at stake.

2086
01:44:01,545 --> 01:44:02,747
All rise.

2087
01:44:06,283 --> 01:44:07,882
The Honorable,
the Chief Justice

2088
01:44:07,884 --> 01:44:09,218
and the Associate Justices...

2089
01:44:09,220 --> 01:44:12,454
of the Supreme Court
of the United States.

2090
01:44:12,456 --> 01:44:15,760
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

2091
01:44:16,793 --> 01:44:18,526
All persons
having business before

2092
01:44:18,528 --> 01:44:21,263
the Honorable
of the Supreme Court...

2093
01:44:21,265 --> 01:44:23,632
Mr. Rosenthal. Mr. Rosenthal.

2094
01:44:23,634 --> 01:44:24,967
Mr. Sulzberger,
do you think

2095
01:44:24,969 --> 01:44:26,535
they'll decide in your favor?

2096
01:44:26,537 --> 01:44:29,237
Well, overall
we feel encouraged.

2097
01:44:29,239 --> 01:44:33,142
27 congressmen filed
amicus briefs on our behalf.

2098
01:44:33,144 --> 01:44:34,276
As well as the ACLU...

2099
01:44:34,278 --> 01:44:35,143
We should make a statement.

2100
01:44:35,145 --> 01:44:36,544
You would think
that's her job.

2101
01:44:36,546 --> 01:44:40,048
I believe everything we had
to say we've already said.

2102
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:42,386
Well, we feel confident...

2103
01:45:00,438 --> 01:45:01,839
Meg Greenfield.

2104
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,138
Okay.

2105
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:07,342
Everyone, listen up!
Listen up!

2106
01:45:07,344 --> 01:45:08,677
We've got a decision.

2107
01:45:08,679 --> 01:45:10,448
We've got a decision.

2108
01:45:13,884 --> 01:45:15,150
- Where'd they go?
- The same place.

2109
01:45:15,152 --> 01:45:18,056
The Supreme Court.
The decision's in.

2110
01:45:28,698 --> 01:45:30,701
The vote is...

2111
01:45:31,969 --> 01:45:33,438
6-3.

2112
01:45:34,304 --> 01:45:36,105
6-3. We win.

2113
01:45:36,107 --> 01:45:38,773
We win! And so does <i>The Times!</i>

2114
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:43,381
Yes!

2115
01:45:46,617 --> 01:45:48,219
No shit!

2116
01:45:51,154 --> 01:45:53,254
Nice job, Gene.

2117
01:45:53,256 --> 01:45:55,826
- No gloating! No gloating.
- I'm just satisfied.

2118
01:46:00,430 --> 01:46:03,432
What? I can't hear you.
It's too loud.

2119
01:46:03,434 --> 01:46:04,666
Okay.

2120
01:46:04,668 --> 01:46:06,535
Listen up, everybody.
Listen up.

2121
01:46:06,537 --> 01:46:08,404
Justice Black's opinion.

2122
01:46:08,406 --> 01:46:09,407
Okay.

2123
01:46:11,876 --> 01:46:15,210
"The founding fathers
gave the free press...

2124
01:46:15,212 --> 01:46:17,982
"the protection
it must have...

2125
01:46:20,384 --> 01:46:24,488
"to fulfill its essential role
in our democracy.

2126
01:46:27,858 --> 01:46:30,191
"The press was
to serve the governed,

2127
01:46:30,193 --> 01:46:31,660
"not the governors."

2128
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:37,400
Thank you.

2129
01:46:56,552 --> 01:46:58,189
That looks great.

2130
01:47:13,871 --> 01:47:17,505
You know what my husband
said about the news?

2131
01:47:17,507 --> 01:47:20,875
He called it the first
rough draft of history.

2132
01:47:20,877 --> 01:47:23,544
That's good, isn't it?

2133
01:47:23,546 --> 01:47:26,313
Oh, well, we don't always
get it right, you know?

2134
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:28,550
We're not always perfect,
but I think

2135
01:47:28,552 --> 01:47:30,785
if we just keep on it,
you know?

2136
01:47:30,787 --> 01:47:32,322
That's the job, isn't it?

2137
01:47:36,792 --> 01:47:38,228
Yes, it is.

2138
01:47:53,943 --> 01:47:56,645
Oh, Ken Clawson came by
to see me earlier.

2139
01:47:56,647 --> 01:47:57,779
Oh?

2140
01:47:57,781 --> 01:47:59,748
Apparently,
Justice is still considering

2141
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:01,016
criminal charges against us.

2142
01:48:01,018 --> 01:48:02,950
Yeah, well,
I bet they are.

2143
01:48:02,952 --> 01:48:04,285
And you're not worried.

2144
01:48:04,287 --> 01:48:06,522
Nope. No, Katharine,
that's your job.

2145
01:48:06,524 --> 01:48:07,989
I suppose it is.

2146
01:48:07,991 --> 01:48:11,159
Oh, thank God the court ruling
was very clear.

2147
01:48:11,161 --> 01:48:14,763
Yeah, well, I'm sure
Nixon will fall right in line.

2148
01:48:14,765 --> 01:48:16,196
Hmm.
Good, because you know...

2149
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:17,965
I don't think
I could ever live through

2150
01:48:17,967 --> 01:48:19,604
something like this again.

1
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,145
Hello, Detroit.

2
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,849
What a pleasure
to be here.

3
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,863
Ladies and gentlemen,
we in the exciting field

4
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,926
of dental supply sales

5
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,165
are here in the Motor City
for a reason...

6
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,730
to provide quality,
precision tools

7
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:43,742
to professionals

8
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,836
who demand the very best.

9
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,643
Thank you.

10
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,844
Whoa-ho-ho,
thank you very much.

11
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,647
Please be seated.

12
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,244
Oh.

13
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,687
I was just
going over my speech.

14
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,058
You've been going
over it for two weeks.

15
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,757
Honey, you know your speech.
I know your speech.

16
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:07,231
- The kids know it.
- It's a big one, Susan.

17
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,202
It's a speech for every sales rep
in the Northeast United States.

18
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,033
It is a big one.

19
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:15,802
You've done very well
for yourself, Andy Fiddler.

20
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:21,504
Now get dressed.
Your plane leaves at 7:00.

21
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:23,447
You know, Detroit's
quite a sports town, honey.

22
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,611
Maybe I'll bring you
back a Piston.

23
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:30,589
Do me a favor.
Just bring yourself back.

24
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,887
Detroit ain't Wisconsin.

25
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,991
# One, two,
three, four #

26
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,761
# I... yeah, yeah #

27
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,800
# I... yeah, yeah #

28
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:48,329
# Rah rah rah rah #

29
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,741
# I... yeah, yeah #

30
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,348
# I just want to celebrate
another day of living #

31
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,478
# I just want to celebrate #

32
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,149
# Another day of life #

33
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,420
# Put my faith
in the people #

34
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,019
# But the people
let me down #

35
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:13,522
# So I turn the other way
and I carry on anyhow #

36
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,932
# That's why I'm telling you I just
wanna celebrate #

37
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:18,698
# Yeah, yeah,
another day of living #

38
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:22,697
# Yeah, I just want
to celebrate #

39
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,267
# Another day of life #

40
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,302
# Had my hand
on a dollar bill #

41
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,975
# And the dollar bill
blew away #

42
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,578
# But the sun is shining down
on me, and it's here to stay #

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,020
# That's why I'm telling you
I just want to celebrate #

44
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,752
# Yeah, yeah,
another day of living #

45
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,352
# Yeah, I just want
to celebrate... #

46
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,831
- Dude! Hold up!
- # Another day of living #

47
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,800
# I just want to celebrate #

48
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:55,832
# Another day of life #

49
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,810
# Don't let it all
get you down, no no... #

50
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:18,024
60 AR-15s,

51
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:22,967
30 M-4s, 6,000 rounds
of 5-5-6 ammunition

52
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,562
and three dozen
M-16s, all of it stolen from the vault

53
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,233
in this building.

54
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,869
But that's not why I rolled you
out of bed at 5:00 a.m., Agent Vann.

55
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,675
You wanna tell me how your partner
winds up a speed bump

56
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,376
on the 94 Freeway?
I'll tell you how.

57
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,511
Your partner was
the inside man on the job.

58
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,680
Once they had the guns,
he became a loose end.

59
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,883
I'm gonna tell you
something else,

60
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,757
something I've learned in 20 years
with Internal Affairs...

61
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,093
if a cop's dirty, nine times out of 10,
his partner's dirty too.

62
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,065
Wouldn't surprise me
if you were the one who popped him.

63
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,170
You got a bug up
your ass about me?

64
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:05,535
Well, let's get it out
right now, right here, you and me.

65
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,337
No, huh?

66
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,043
So step off,
stop wasting my time.

67
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,914
You don't seem too upset
about your partner.

68
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,410
You want to charge me with not being
upset, go right ahead. Be my guest.

69
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,220
Hell, I'll write a full confession
about how I don't give a shit.

70
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,785
If he was dirty,
he got what he deserved.

71
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,264
I'm not finished
with you.

72
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,325
Well, I'm finished with you,
and let me tell you

73
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:31,859
what I learned
in all my years on the job...

74
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,429
Don't trust anyone.

75
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,374
That includes partners

76
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,606
and especially
Internal Affairs skid marks.

77
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:41,510
I'll be seeing you, Vann.

78
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,616
I tried to keep
I.A. Off your back.

79
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,726
Booty. Mmm,
don't get into this.

80
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,227
I'm already into this.

81
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,095
You know those weapons
will be out of the city within 24 hours.

82
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,395
Yeah, well, you can't
set up a buy in 24 hours.

83
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,597
- Watch me.
- Vann, nothing stupid.

84
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,662
Yes, Lieutenant.

85
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,906
Bye-bye, enjoy your stay.
Bye, hope you had a nice flight.

86
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,850
I had a wonderful flight, and I'm
wondering if you can do me a favor.

87
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,446
I was talking to one
of the stewardesses back there,

88
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,855
and we were discussing tongue scrapers.
I found one in my bag.

89
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,860
I'm wondering
if you can pass this along.

90
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,953
- I'm a dental supply salesman.
- Yes, I will.

91
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,588
Sir, you might
have to step aside.

92
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,360
Just tell her it's
daily tongue-scraping

93
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,162
and anti-bacterial
conditioning

94
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,294
which will assure her
the freshest breath.

95
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,218
See this right here?

96
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:57,154
This is a nickel-plated Ladysmith
nine Mary-Mary chrome inlay. Go on,

97
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,716
- feel that.
- It's got a nice weight to it.

98
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,728
- Yeah, so do you, baby.
- What?

99
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,432
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, hold up... that's a cop car!

100
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,170
Get your ass off my car, Booty!

101
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:24,705
Come on!

102
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,844
Your ass is still
on my car, Booty!

103
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:34,019
Run faster, Booty!
Pump those arms! Get those knees up!

104
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,756
- Your form is all jacked up, dawg!
- What you want, man?

105
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,957
- I want to buy some guns!
- I don't know

106
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,660
- what you're talking about!
- I'm talking about a telephone pole.

107
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,293
What?

108
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,418
Why do we have
to do this every time?

109
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,219
It's these repetitive ass-whippings
that cause guys like me

110
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,691
- to burn out on the job.
- Du... ah-ha... ah!

111
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,389
Somebody wiped out
our vault last night. Who was it?

112
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,364
- How the hell should I know?
- I'm gonna check the front of my car.

113
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,960
If it smells like ass, I'm gonna
beat you like a runaway slave.

114
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,561
No no, all right,
all right, all right.

115
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,469
- All right what?
- Maybe I heard something.

116
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,565
Tell me what you heard.

117
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,906
Something about a lot
of merchandise in play. That's all.

118
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,913
Ooh. You know
how I can tell you're lying?

119
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,745
I can smell the bullshit
coming out of your mouth.

120
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,946
No, all right!
Maybe I know one of the guys, huh?

121
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,477
Well, hook me up.
Tell him you found a buyer.

122
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,285
Oh, man, he already got
a buyer. You're too late.

123
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,418
Tell him I'll double his price.
I can get 20 grand cash right now.

124
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,122
20 grand? Man, that'll only
get you a taste, dawg.

125
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,758
A taste is all I need.

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,463
Hook me up. Now.

127
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,318
- $38.50.
- That was very nice drive in, Mr., uh...

128
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,513
- is it Bedwetter?
- Bedwe-teer.

129
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,216
I see you're from
Turkey, Mr. Budweeder.

130
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,249
I've got $20, $40.
There you go. Keep the change.

131
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:18,354
I was in Turkey
recently, uh...

132
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,434
Santos,
what's cracking, dawg?

133
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,962
- Yo, I need 20 grand.
- Yeah, don't we all?

134
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,306
I need that in non-sequential
unmarked bills, and I'm in a hurry.

135
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,538
I'm not your
personal ATM, man.

136
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,570
Come on, Santos.

137
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:38,105
You know you're gonna give it up,
so cut the bullshit.

138
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,710
Hey, I don't have that kind
of cash down here right now.

139
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,655
Nuh-uh. See? You're lying. Now
I personally logged a million in cash

140
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,523
into that vault
right over there just last month

141
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,687
on a case we both
know hasn't gone to trial yet,

142
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,027
so you're still holding.

143
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,532
What happened
between us, Santos?

144
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,058
Where the love, dawg?

145
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,901
You realize it's my ass
if you come up short again.

146
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,339
It's just flash money.
I'll have it back this afternoon.

147
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:04,342
Come on, now go
and get that.

148
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:06,901
I'll have the paperwork
done by the time you get back.

149
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:11,144
All right, but I need
that money back here by 4:00.

150
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,673
You can trust me, man.

151
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,243
Come on now.
I'm in a hurry. Chop-chop.

152
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,380
Work that combination, baby.

153
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,390
Look, man, they'll give you a taste,
then they'll tell you

154
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,797
where to bring the money.
They don't want the goods and the cash

155
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,529
- in the same spot.
- Booty, I do this for a living.

156
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,163
Look, I don't know these guys.
They're from out of town.

157
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,197
What do you know, Booty?

158
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:42,575
This is the place, man.
He'll give you a gun and a phone now

159
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,776
and call you later
for the money.

160
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,808
Take the corner seat
at the counter

161
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,583
and be carrying a "USA Today."
A "USA Today," the newspaper.

162
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,183
Look, man, I did what
you asked me to do. I'm done with this.

163
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,455
You better hurry up, man.

164
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,428
By this time tomorrow,
the guns will be gone.

165
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,502
- You want a taste?
- Pardon me?

166
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,771
- There's your taste.
- That's my taste?

167
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:51,105
Wait for our call.

168
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,950
Hey!

169
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,324
What?

170
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,303
He's got a gun.

171
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,671
No no, this is not...
No no no, it's not my gun.

172
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,835
It's the man that
was sitting here he j... he just left.

173
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,038
Oh oh!
He's got a gun, man!

174
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,774
It's going back in the bag.
Back in the bag.

175
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,839
- Drop the gun!
- Ah!

176
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,010
- Drop the gun! Now!
- Yes.

177
00:11:26,051 --> 00:11:28,076
- Yes, the gun's going down.
- Drop it!

178
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,612
The gun is going down.
Gun is down.

179
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,420
- Gun is down.
- Just shut up.

180
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,983
All right. Ah!

181
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,393
You picked the wrong day to pull
a stick-up, dickwad.

182
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:39,329
It's not my gun.
Some guy gave it to me.

183
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,356
- What guy?
- Some guy. He gave me a bag,

184
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,096
- and he said, "Taste it. Taste it."
- He said what?

185
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,331
- Something about a taste.
- Tell me what he said,

186
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,738
exactly word for word
what he said.

187
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,470
He said, "That's your taste,"
but there was nothing to taste,

188
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,035
just a phone and a gun.
Look, I just went in for a cof...

189
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,071
- Oh shit. They think you're me.
- They think I'm black?

190
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,641
No, they don't think
you're... A.T.F.

191
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,516
You're coming with me.

192
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:03,680
What? I have done
nothing wrong!

193
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:15,123
- Well, Simon?
- It's coming.

194
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,034
All right, I got him.

195
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,835
"Fiddler, Andy.
Milwaukee, Wisconsin."

196
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,365
He's not federal, he's not
local, no law enforcement.

197
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,607
- No sheet. He's clean.
- Yeah, he's too clean.

198
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,342
- Screw him.
- No, wait a minute.

199
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,874
"Istanbul, Turkey.
Customs.

200
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,787
- Trafficking."
- Turkey? He do any time?

201
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,122
- Interpol shows an outstanding warrant.
- He got away from the Turks?

202
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,358
No shit. This guy's gotta be
smarter than he looks, huh?

203
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,798
Well, he can't be
any dumber than he looks.

204
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,200
So what's this guy
look like?

205
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:55,866
Well, he, uh...
he had very good teeth.

206
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:58,741
- What does he look like?
- He looks good. He looks good.

207
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,473
He had a very nice face,
very handsome face.

208
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,947
He was a very
attractive man.

209
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,814
N... not to me.

210
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,252
Uh, I mean, I am married
to a woman.

211
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,313
And even if I wasn't married,

212
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,450
I don't mean that kind of attractive.
Personally,

213
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,393
- he was not attractive to me.
- Describe him to me.

214
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,328
Short hair.
Short hair

215
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,026
which made his head
look smaller than it actually is,

216
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,661
and I only mention that because I've
been told my head is somewhat large,

217
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,297
and when I looked over at his,
it's like... you know when you look

218
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:31,241
through binoculars the wrong
way, it-it-it looks...

219
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:35,076
That's you.
Answer it!

220
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,513
Hello.

221
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:38,175
- Turk.
- Just a moment, please.

222
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,947
- Can you believe this?
- He wants to talk to the Turk.

223
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,476
- That's you.
- That's me?

224
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,614
- That's you.
- I'm the Turk?

225
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,783
Look at you.

226
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:51,262
This is the Turk.

227
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:54,129
Okay, listen, Turk.
When this phone rings, you answer it.

228
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,464
- You understand?
- Yes, I answer it.

229
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,732
- You and you alone. Are we clear?
- Me and me alone, right.

230
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,740
Great. Now listen, you put
the package in the trash can

231
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:06,643
on the northwest corner of Fort
and Woodward in five minutes.

232
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:09,044
- Hello.
- So what did he say?

233
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,515
Something about a package
and a trash can.

234
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,815
Look, I have nothing to do
with this. I'm here for a convention.

235
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,821
I don't give a shit.

236
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,323
Now what trash can?

237
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,486
Fort and Woodward.

238
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,291
Whoa!

239
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,306
Take this package,
put it in that trash can,

240
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:44,838
and you can go.

241
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,081
I should point out
to you, sir,

242
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,490
that I am taking
a mental picture of you

243
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,585
just in case there's...

244
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:58,994
any... trouble.

245
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,870
Hey, you know what?
Th-this... this is not for you.

246
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,607
Who's it for?

247
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,774
Well, it's... it's,
uh, for somebody else.

248
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,613
- Who?
- Just someone.

249
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,051
- Someone you don't know.
- Try me.

250
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,420
No, I'm not trying you.
This is not garbage, okay?

251
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,425
This is business,

252
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,724
so just please
don't touch it.

253
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,889
All right,
give me the bag.

254
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,890
- Give me the bag.
- Oh, Jesus.

255
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,960
It's not your bag.
See what he's doing?

256
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,598
- He took my bag.
- Who is this guy?

257
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,666
- This bag is mine! It's not his.
- Damn!

258
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:21,236
Okay okay.
What is the matter with you?

259
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,340
- Just let me go. All right.
- Get up. Get up!

260
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,351
- Get in the car. Get in the car!
- I think we should...

261
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,183
We should look
for another can.

262
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:36,920
What the hell is
the matter with you?

263
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,726
I ask you to do one thing,
and you screw it up.

264
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,468
- Hello.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

265
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,835
I ask you to do one thing,
and you screw it up.

266
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,203
Yes, well, this was
not planned well.

267
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,231
No no, listen, Turk.
You know what?

268
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,573
You just bring the package
to First and Bagley

269
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,738
and wait there.

270
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:59,274
So what did he say now?

271
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,218
Hey, get back here!

272
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,681
Excuse me.

273
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,315
Now you pay.

274
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,383
Get off my car!

275
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,663
Get down! Oh man,
he's got a gun! Ah!

276
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,895
Ouch!
Ouch! Ouch!

277
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,996
Ow! Oh! Ow!
Oh, boy! Oh!

278
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,202
Ah! Ah!
Ow ow ow ow!

279
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:30,976
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

280
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,007
- Yes, hello, I've been shot.
- Can you give me a location?

281
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,815
- I don't know. Downtown.
- Where downtown, sir?

282
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,549
A man in a black car
kidnapped me.

283
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,250
Do you have
a license plate number?

284
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,350
Yes, just give me
a second.

285
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,762
"347DNB." Hurry.

286
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:48,265
I just called 9-1-1,

287
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,268
- and you are in serious trouble.
- Get up.

288
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,270
- You shot me.
- I grazed you.

289
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,135
Well, that's still
shooting me!

290
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:57,198
- Watch your ass.
- Ow ow ow ow!

291
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,572
You could have
killed me back there.

292
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,671
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead.

293
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,706
I wanted to graze you, you're grazed.
It was a training bullet.

294
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:10,051
Well, I'm bleeding, although you might
call it "training blood."

295
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,487
Here, use this.

296
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,050
Taco sauce?

297
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,062
Yes, it's a natural
antiseptic.

298
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,360
Sprinkle some of that on your ass
so you don't get an infection.

299
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,596
Yeah, well, I don't even
wanna know how you discovered that.

300
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,798
So what, you keep
this in your glove compartment and just

301
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:30,274
splash it on a salami sandwich
and then splash some on your behind?

302
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,300
Use it or don't use it.
It's your ass.

303
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,938
You got any guacamole in there?
I hear it makes a great cold compress.

304
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,278
- Just put it back!
- All right, I'll use it. I'll use it.

305
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,656
Don't you have
traffic to look at?

306
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,124
Oh, shit.
You gotta be kidding me.

307
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,669
Get out of the vehicle
with your hands in the air!

308
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,970
Get out of the car
and show me your hands!

309
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,806
Turn around!
Hands on your head!

310
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,937
- No no no no no, I'm not with him.
- Your hands!

311
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,913
I don't know him!
He just...

312
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,745
he... he...
he kidnapped me.

313
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,013
He took me
against my will.

314
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,020
He... look. You see?

315
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,750
He wanted to put
taco sauce on my butt.

316
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,156
The guy is nuts.

317
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,956
Nuts.

318
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,859
- Hands!
- Run my plates!

319
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,864
You! Back in the car.

320
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,332
- Your hands!
- You wanna see my hands?

321
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,768
Here.

322
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:35,364
Federal agent.
Run my plates!

323
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,041
- The car is federal, sir. A.T.F.
- That's right.

324
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,109
Federal agent.

325
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:52,351
Federal prisoner.
Back in the car!

326
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,986
You are interfering
with a federal investigation.

327
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:58,825
Move your asses!

328
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,503
That was fun.

329
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,522
Give this to him
and walk away.

330
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,658
Hey. If you try
to run this time,

331
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,692
I'm gonna put a bullet
in part of the ass you really need.

332
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,587
Ooh-ooh! Oh!

333
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,072
So you like the merch?

334
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:19,369
- The merch?
- The merch.

335
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,675
Well, you know,
there are days

336
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,910
that I like it
and days that I don't.

337
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,748
It depends.
I'm on the fence.

338
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:32,052
- Do you like the merchandise, Turk?
- Yes, I do...

339
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,921
like the merchandise.

340
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,587
I, uh...
thanks for asking.

341
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,096
So there's gonna be
20 grand in there, right?

342
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,724
In the bag.
Come on.

343
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,013
Good.

344
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:59,482
Good first step.
We'll be in touch.

345
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,009
And, uh,
one more thing, Turk...

346
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:04,078
No more fruitcake
stuff, okay?

347
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,785
- Sure.
- Good. Goodbye.

348
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:18,968
Get in the car.

349
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,438
- Why?
- I'm not done with you yet.

350
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,964
- You said I was done.
- I lied. I do that.

351
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,000
- Now get up. Get in the car.
- No.

352
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,706
Get up!

353
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,045
Hey... don't make me
chase you.

354
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:32,481
I'm tell...

355
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,382
- Hey!
- Stop!

356
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,852
Stop! Help me!

357
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,548
- Hey!
- Help!

358
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,614
You're under arrest.
Hands on the car.

359
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,853
On the car!

360
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,830
Who the hell
is this guy?

361
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,263
Run that.

362
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,703
He's international.

363
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,800
- Ow!
- Watch your head.

364
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:12,083
Okay, that's it.
I am writing a letter.

365
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,216
- Number 3.
- Number 3.

366
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:21,028
Three, step forward.
Three, that's you.

367
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,596
- That's him.
- You sure?

368
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,765
I'll never forget
that face.

369
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,173
- All right, thank you. You can go.
- Excuse me.

370
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,871
I'd like to speak
to whoever's in charge, please.

371
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,574
All right, number 3, stay.
The rest can go.

372
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,412
Thank you.

373
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,214
Boy, sometimes you
just have to speak up.

374
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,788
- Are you in charge here?
- Yes, I am.

375
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,691
Oh, boy, have I been waiting
to talk to you.

376
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,490
- Really?
- My name is Andy Fiddler.

377
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,656
I'm in dental supply sales,
and believe you me,

378
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,962
I never thought I'd be standing here
in a police station

379
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,799
- with a bullet wound in the keister.
- Hmm.

380
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,237
But I am extremely upset
with this man here,

381
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:03,797
and I must confess
with your whole operation in general,

382
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:07,539
because quite frankly,
I have nothing to do with any of this.

383
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,570
Well, that's not what
it looks like, Mr. Keister.

384
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,639
The weapon you used
in the diner,

385
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,311
stolen from A.T.F.'s vault.

386
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,320
The gun you're robbing
the cashier with.

387
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,379
Oh, no no no no.
No no, there's no robbing.

388
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,948
I'm not robbing.
You see, although I can certainly see

389
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,392
how you'd get
that impression.

390
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:27,922
We also got a red notice
from Interpol when we ran your name.

391
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,491
There's an outstanding
warrant for your arrest.

392
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:34,130
- What?
- Istanbul, Turkey ring any bells?

393
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:38,268
Oh. Oh, yes.

394
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:40,709
It does ring some bells,

395
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:44,272
and believe it or not, there is
a perfectly reasonable explanation

396
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:47,614
for that, and you will
find it very funny,

397
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,984
- 'cause it's quite a story.
- Tell it on the way.

398
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:53,787
- Place your left hand here.
- So I took the family to Europe

399
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,761
in the summer of '98, and one
of our stops was Istanbul, in Turkey...

400
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,923
a must-see
if you've never been.

401
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:03,832
- Anyhoo, my wife has this thing about...
- Yo, Vann, phone call.

402
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,806
...Persian rugs.
Okay, I'm not a complainer,

403
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,274
but that officer
was very abusive.

404
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,937
I mean, not only was
he physically violent,

405
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:17,209
but... but more disturbing to me,
he... he was just rude.

406
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:19,876
- Vann.
- Your daughter wants to know

407
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,045
if you're coming
to her recital tonight.

408
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,954
Oh you know,
I can't.

409
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:27,355
Uh, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

410
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:32,159
Um, I gotta go.
Would you tell her for me?

411
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,496
You need to tell her.

412
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:42,998
So when we got back
to the hotel,

413
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,532
we discovered
the rug is too big for the suitcase.

414
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,545
So we decided
to leave the rug at the hotel

415
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,706
to be sent to us
when we got back home.

416
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,340
Turn right.

417
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:54,374
So we finally get home,
but we never got the rug.

418
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,047
Long story short,
we get a letter from the hotel

419
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,215
that said the rug had
been seized at Customs.

420
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,623
Now evidently
this rug had been stolen.

421
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:04,423
It was a 1,000-year-old
prayer rug,

422
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,397
and... and it was stolen,
but how was I to know?

423
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:11,061
I didn't know, and I'm the one
that's out $230.

424
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,662
Yeah, it was all very innocent,
as I'm sure

425
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,538
- you can now understand.
- I see.

426
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,508
- Lock him up.
- What?

427
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,205
- Let's go.
- What?

428
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,770
- Let's go.
- Get him out of here!

429
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,475
What? Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

430
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,143
- This way.
- I have done nothing wrong!

431
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,347
- Come on. Move it.
- I have... I... I...

432
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,049
I haven't...
I haven't done anything!

433
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,958
Yo, this is the number
to this phone.

434
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,985
I want you to put
a trace on it.

435
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,897
I want the owner and an address.
Call me when you got it.

436
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,924
Okay.

437
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,665
Lieu, you looking
for me?

438
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:53,142
Explain the Wisconsin kid.

439
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:56,636
I set up a buy with the bad guys,
he got in the middle of it,

440
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,546
- now they think he's me.
- So you're telling me

441
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,107
- the guns are still in play.
- Yeah.

442
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,210
- How do you know this isn't a setup?
- With this guy?

443
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:05,416
- Yeah, with this guy.
- Not with this guy.

444
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:06,821
Okay, where is he?

445
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,622
He's in holding,
and he's gonna stay there.

446
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,653
Yes, Ma'am.

447
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:22,065
Shit.
They ate him already.

448
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,671
Caucasian gentlemen.
Big glasses.

449
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:32,774
Oh yeah, didn't have
the heart to put him in there.

450
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,122
Ah-ah!

451
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:43,116
Thank you.

452
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,721
- Come on.
- So, am I free to go now?

453
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:48,596
Go? Oh, hell no.
They're fixing a shit sandwich upstairs,

454
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,601
and you're
the mayonnaise.

455
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,626
Possession of a stolen weapon,

456
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,831
armed robbery and the Turkish
government wants

457
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,068
to have a little chat
with you before we're done.

458
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,872
Okay, I want to talk
to an attorney.

459
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,175
I get one phone call,
and I want to call an attorney.

460
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,545
Let me lay your options
out for you here...

461
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,710
You can come with me
as a Suspect Who's Cooperating,

462
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:12,086
or you can stay here
and get married tonight.

463
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:18,918
- So what's it gonna be?
- Okay, just so we're clear...

464
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,798
I am not choosing
to go with you.

465
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:26,699
I'm choosing
not to stay with them.

466
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,070
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

467
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,114
Lag escort, first-time
session.

468
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,618
Hang on.

469
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,085
This is one
screwed up crew.

470
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,928
All right, just so
there's no confusion, here's the deal...

471
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,933
You're in my world now,
not yours.

472
00:28:55,967 --> 00:29:00,495
And in my world, your responsibilities
begin and end with me.

473
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,371
And what would those
responsibilities be?

474
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,399
Well, these guys think you wanna
buy guns from them.

475
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,411
I need you to meet 'em one more time
and set up a buy,

476
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,846
- so I can bust their ass.
- Okay, I am developing a slight phobia

477
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,612
about meeting these guys.
The whole meeting thing, quite frankly,

478
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,778
is getting irritating.
I have to be honest.

479
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,186
Look, I have done everything
you've asked me to do.

480
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,190
Why can't I go?

481
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:22,192
What does any
of this have to do with me?

482
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:25,127
Because every time
these guys meet somebody new,

483
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,859
they're on the lookout
for the Man.

484
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,198
And you most certainly
do not look like the Man.

485
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:34,796
Oh, I don't look
like the Man.

486
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,138
Well, thank you, because
that clears up absolutely nothing.

487
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,269
Who... who is the Man?

488
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,041
The heat, the pig,
the po-po, 5-0,

489
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,914
the undercover agent
that's gonna bust their ass.

490
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,976
You're such a white bread son
of a bitch, these assholes trust you.

491
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,614
Well, you know,
people do trust me.

492
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:54,955
- That's not a compliment, shit stain.
- Okay, you know what?

493
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,224
Why do you swear so much?
Do you think it makes you sound tougher

494
00:29:58,262 --> 00:30:00,230
when you just swear
all the time?

495
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:03,097
- Fuck you.
- Okay, that's good. That's really good.

496
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,592
Really classy. You know,
I could go around all day saying,

497
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:08,969
"F-U. F this
and F that

498
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,271
and F-ing this,
you mother-F-er."

499
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:15,643
But I don't because there has
to be some civility in the world.

500
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:21,178
Incidentally, there is a trick
you can use to curb that habit.

501
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,655
Every time you feel like saying
the "F" word, just go ahead and say it,

502
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,954
and then add,
"Crying out loud."

503
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,620
Fuck crying out loud.

504
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:33,596
Fuck crying out loud.
Fuck crying out loud.

505
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,191
And before you know it, you're saying,
"Oh, for crying out loud."

506
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,329
Let's see here.

507
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:44,603
- Oh, boy. Well...
- You did make her a promise.

508
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,371
You always break
your promises to her.

509
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,641
You want your daughter growing up
like you, not trusting anybody?

510
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,170
- That's not the point.
- It's exactly the point.

511
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:53,046
No, it's not.

512
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,450
You promised her you'd be
at her recital tonight.

513
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,420
Something came up.

514
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,754
You know, my little girl's a ballerina too,
and she's exactly your age.

515
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,384
- Really?
- Yeah,

516
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,520
I help her
with her pirouettes all the time.

517
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,029
That's not
what this is about.

518
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,032
This is about
you not wanting to go

519
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,296
- because her stepdad's gonna be there.
- Oh.

520
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:12,734
Is he dancing tonight, too?

521
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,635
And with the right
feet positioning...

522
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:18,506
there you go,
okay. Well!

523
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,171
Yeah, that's good.

524
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,510
Daddy, can Andy come
with you tonight?

525
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,709
Um...

526
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,411
Look, honey...

527
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,546
Daddy can't come tonight.
I'm sorry.

528
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,355
But I promise I will be there
next time. I swear.

529
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,861
I'm gonna make it up to you.

530
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:40,921
Oh, fuck...
crying out loud.

531
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,661
Hold on.

532
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,727
Look, Daddy's
gotta go, okay?

533
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,767
Go ahead.
Goodbye.

534
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,583
It was very nice
meeting you, Kate.

535
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,590
- You too.
- So what you got?

536
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,024
- The owner of that phone?
- Yeah.

537
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,688
- It's Cortez. Manny Cortez.
- Who?

538
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,095
- Katie.
- Thanks.

539
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,893
Come inside,
sweetheart.

540
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,962
Hang on.

541
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,907
Cortez's is back elevator,
second floor.

542
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,740
Oh, shit.

543
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,409
- Don't get up.
- You scared me, man.

544
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,316
What are you still
doing here, Cortez?

545
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,481
You were supposed to meet us
at the warehouse over three hours ago.

546
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:42,287
Do you mind?
I'm, uh...

547
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,556
I'm in the middle
of something here.

548
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,620
I truly don't care.

549
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:50,430
Hey, look. There's too much heat
on those guns, all right?

550
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,301
I mean, you killed a cop.
That was not in the deal.

551
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:55,601
Yeah, well,
he became a problem.

552
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,742
Listen, we got
the merchandise.

553
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,744
You need
to pay us for it.

554
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,905
I'm out, all right?

555
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,883
- I cannot do shit with those guns.
- You know what, Cortez?

556
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,352
That's your problem.
You got the money or not?

557
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,855
Find another buyer,
all right?

558
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,084
And you know what?
I suggest you get out of town

559
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,752
as quickly as possible.

560
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:19,991
Hey. Yo.
Close the door on your way out.

561
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,624
Sure.

562
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:29,965
Well, I guess that just leaves
the Turk.

563
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,497
I guess so.

564
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,938
Well, you've got
a very nice family.

565
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,212
You've just got
a wonderful daughter

566
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,446
- and a lovely wife.
- Ex-wife.

567
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:44,886
Ex-wife, yes, well, she seems
like a very nice person.

568
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,617
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so... so...

569
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,181
so it just didn't work out, huh?

570
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,888
Well, whatever.

571
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,897
- Would you like to see my family?
- No!

572
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,922
Well, I would like
to see my family.

573
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,999
This is my oldest...
Hannah, she's 12.

574
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,666
I'm trying to get her interested
in the dental equipment game,

575
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:08,202
but I guess at that age, you know,
it's just not cool yet.

576
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:11,340
This is my little
ballerina right here.

577
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:17,515
And this is my wife Susan,
holding our newest addition... Emily.

578
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,217
Just turned 2.
Already talking a mile a minute.

579
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,056
Just talk talk talk
talk talk talk talk talk talk talk

580
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,426
talk talk talk.
A regular little chatterbox.

581
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,398
- I wonder who she got that from.
- I think she got it from me.

582
00:34:28,432 --> 00:34:30,957
- You think?
- Oh...

583
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:37,597
Well, I am, uh... I'm sorry
about your... situation.

584
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,576
What situation
would that be?

585
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,805
Well, you've got
people who love you,

586
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,747
and yet you seem
like a very sad and lonely man.

587
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,750
- I'm not lonely.
- Well, I think you're lonely.

588
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,116
- I'm not lonely.
- Fine, you're not lonely. You're alone.

589
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,781
Yes, I'm alone,
but I'm not lonely.

590
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:53,790
It's two different things.

591
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,851
Does the expression
"No man is an island" ring any bells?

592
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,796
Does the expression
"Shut your ass up" ring any bells?

593
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,241
What now?

594
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,807
I have to go visit
a friend of mine.

595
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:23,149
- Can I go with you?
- No.

596
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,382
Oh, well, I would
really like to go with you.

597
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:28,881
Look, everybody
in this neighborhood knows my ride.

598
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,520
- Nobody messes with it.
- Okay.

599
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,217
- # Big booty bitches, well... #
- Oh!

600
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,652
# Like to dutch,
another one bites the dust... #

601
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,064
Cortez.

602
00:36:13,904 --> 00:36:16,464
Manny, where you at?

603
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,873
You hiding
under the bed again?

604
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,307
Woo! Manny.

605
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,022
- A.T.F.
- Yeah, this is Vann.

606
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:42,464
Would you send a bag wagon over
to Manny Cortez's place?

607
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,730
- The gun dealer?
- Yeah, he took the deluxe cruise

608
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,760
up shit's creek...

609
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,796
compliments
of a.45 to the chest.

610
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,582
No.

611
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,724
Hey! Hey!

612
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,269
Good afternoon.
Out of the car.

613
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,373
- Oh! Oh! Oh-ah!
- Whoa! What are you doing?

614
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:38,452
Ooh.

615
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,068
- Oh!
- Hey!

616
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:55,537
This was not a good idea.

617
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,235
Oh boy! Oh!

618
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:03,269
Oh!

619
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,954
Oh!

620
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:30,035
Drives pretty good.

621
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,106
You idiot! Moron!

622
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,917
Well, you left the keys
in the ignition.

623
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,558
Not the smartest thing
to do for a policeman.

624
00:38:52,062 --> 00:38:55,190
This would be a good time
for you to be quiet.

625
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,496
I know that's nearly
impossible for you,

626
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,527
but if I hear the sound
of your voice right now,

627
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,802
I can't be responsible
for my actions.

628
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:08,642
So this would be
a very good time for you to shut up!

629
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,318
I have a small question.

630
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,246
I still have a question,
and I think I'm entitled...

631
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,051
What?

632
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,819
Do you have a plan?

633
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:56,485
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

634
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,394
If you fail to plan,
you plan to fail.

635
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,866
Just a little constructive
criticism, okay?

636
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,130
That's how two people
working together help ea...

637
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,899
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
We're not working together,

638
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:10,435
So get that thought out of your mind.
Nobody said

639
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,267
- we were working together.
- Excuse me.

640
00:40:12,305 --> 00:40:14,273
You dragged me
into this,

641
00:40:14,307 --> 00:40:16,275
and I'm giving a speech
at 10:00 A.M. Tomorrow,

642
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:18,504
so the sooner you start
treating me like a partner...

643
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:20,706
Hey!
We are not partners.

644
00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:22,612
Ain't no way in the world
that can happen.

645
00:40:22,649 --> 00:40:26,244
Well, what am I
then? Hmm?

646
00:40:26,286 --> 00:40:28,254
What are you?

647
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:31,780
You are my bitch,

648
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:36,023
that's what...
my own personal bitch.

649
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:39,430
I pulled you out
of lockup as an S.W.C.,

650
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:41,434
which means "Suspect
Who's Cooperating,"

651
00:40:41,468 --> 00:40:43,834
which means
I own your ass,

652
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,203
which means
when I pull the strings, you dance.

653
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,539
Till then, you sit there,
keep your mouth shut

654
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:54,240
and don't say a word
like the puppet you are.

655
00:40:58,351 --> 00:41:01,286
Hey, yo, Booty.

656
00:41:01,321 --> 00:41:03,186
Hey, Booty,
what's up, man?

657
00:41:03,223 --> 00:41:05,384
Let's go, come on.

658
00:41:06,893 --> 00:41:09,225
- Pass the ball, yo.
- What up?

659
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:17,627
Booty!

660
00:41:17,671 --> 00:41:20,834
Oh damn, man!
Hey! Come on, man!

661
00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:22,933
Ah! Ah... ah... hey!

662
00:41:24,945 --> 00:41:27,846
Booty, we never
finished our conversation.

663
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:30,509
Man, I told you
everything I know, man!

664
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:38,851
I will cheese-grate
your ass through this fence.

665
00:41:39,926 --> 00:41:44,260
Oh, come on, dawg.
Look, I don't know no more! Wha... ah!

666
00:41:44,297 --> 00:41:46,925
All right, all right, all right!
Shit, all right!

667
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:50,232
Would you get that phone book
over there for me?

668
00:41:53,707 --> 00:41:55,800
- Who's this guy?
- Man, I don't know his name.

669
00:41:55,842 --> 00:41:58,037
Look, would you get
your car out of my ass, please...

670
00:41:58,078 --> 00:41:59,409
- Thank you.
...dawg. Ow!

671
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:01,573
Now who are those guys
you hooked me up with?

672
00:42:01,615 --> 00:42:03,947
- I need names.
- Man, they gonna kill me, dawg!

673
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:06,077
- They gonna kill my whole family!
- Names!

674
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,746
- Ow!
- Hey, just give him the name.

675
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:08,755
- Give him the name.
- Name!

676
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:11,019
- Look, I can't!
- Just... just let's have a name.

677
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:12,422
- Look, I can't! Ow!
- You know what?

678
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:14,290
Make up a name!
Give him something!

679
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:15,851
- Look, there's no name here.
- No, they'll kill me.

680
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:17,887
He doesn't have
the name, uh...

681
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:20,399
Look, all right, all right! Look,
the dude in the picture, his name is...

682
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:22,731
- Joey Trent, man.
- Good, good name. That's a good name.

683
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:24,862
- That's a good name.
- No no no, that's... that's a real name!

684
00:42:24,905 --> 00:42:26,770
- All right, keep talking.
- Look, I didn't know nothing

685
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:28,434
- about no cop getting killed.
- Yeah, right.

686
00:42:28,475 --> 00:42:29,772
- Well, who's Joey's boss?
- I don't know.

687
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,970
Some dude
from out of town.

688
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:34,572
- Then give me an out of town name!
- I don't know his name, man!

689
00:42:34,614 --> 00:42:36,809
- Oh, shit! Uhn!
- I'm out of it. I'm out of it.

690
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,715
Look, the dude's
named Kane!

691
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:41,414
The crew boss name is Kane, man.
Now that's all I know,

692
00:42:41,454 --> 00:42:43,718
other than he have a bad rep.
Dawg, look,

693
00:42:43,757 --> 00:42:46,123
- I swear on my Moms on that.
- Who hooked you up with Joey?

694
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:49,094
Man, Cortez, dawg.

695
00:42:49,129 --> 00:42:51,996
Ooh, not a good sign.
Cortez is dead.

696
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:54,398
Man.

697
00:42:54,434 --> 00:42:56,129
Excuse me.

698
00:42:56,169 --> 00:42:58,467
Hello.

699
00:43:00,173 --> 00:43:03,165
Okay.
Well, that was him.

700
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:08,574
You lucked out, Holmes,
but we will continue this conversation.

701
00:43:08,615 --> 00:43:11,516
- Shut up, man.
- Oh, and, Booty...

702
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:14,349
watch your ass.

703
00:43:15,922 --> 00:43:19,881
Man, you broke
my gold tooth, dawg!

704
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,268
- Where we going?
- Uh, Lucky's Bar and Grill in one hour.

705
00:43:31,304 --> 00:43:35,604
- Is that all he said?
- No. No, there was something else.

706
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:37,769
- What did he say? What did he say?
- You're not gonna like it.

707
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:40,006
- You're gonna get mad.
- Tell me what he said.

708
00:43:40,046 --> 00:43:42,207
- He wants me to bring money. A lot.
- How much? How much?

709
00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:44,547
- Look, I'm just the messenger.
- How much money?

710
00:43:44,584 --> 00:43:46,142
- Half a million dollars.
- What?

711
00:43:46,186 --> 00:43:49,519
- I know. It was a heart-thumper.
- Shit!

712
00:43:50,857 --> 00:43:53,826
- Where we going?
- My ATM.

713
00:43:58,932 --> 00:44:02,493
- Yo, Santos.
- Thank God.

714
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:04,526
I need that
20 grand back.

715
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:06,664
I.A. Wants to look
at my books.

716
00:44:06,706 --> 00:44:09,140
I need some more.

717
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:12,076
Are you out of your mind?
You think there's any way in hell

718
00:44:12,112 --> 00:44:14,080
I'm gonna give you
another $20,000?

719
00:44:14,114 --> 00:44:16,412
I need a half mil.

720
00:44:18,385 --> 00:44:21,548
It's just show and tell.
I'll have it back in an hour.

721
00:44:23,256 --> 00:44:24,917
Go away.

722
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:27,017
Santos, open up.
I got something to tell you.

723
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,358
- What?
- Open up and I'll tell you.

724
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:31,921
What?

725
00:44:31,965 --> 00:44:34,763
Look, here's the thing.

726
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:37,702
You give me the half mil, I bust
the bad guys and make this right.

727
00:44:37,737 --> 00:44:39,728
You don't, you lose
the 20 grand,

728
00:44:39,773 --> 00:44:41,741
and you take a shit bath
for coming up short.

729
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:44,767
At least this way, you do what I ask,
you got a shot.

730
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:49,006
Why you doing this
to me?

731
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:50,914
You trusted me.

732
00:44:50,951 --> 00:44:52,748
Come on.

733
00:45:05,932 --> 00:45:08,264
- I'm hungry.
- You'll live.

734
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:10,360
No, no, no.
I... I... I'm really hungry.

735
00:45:10,403 --> 00:45:13,372
- Come on, man.
- No, my blood sugar is low,

736
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:16,204
and I'm feeling faint.
I haven't eaten all day.

737
00:45:16,242 --> 00:45:19,575
- I would like some food.
- Okay, I'll get you a burger.

738
00:45:19,612 --> 00:45:22,638
- I would rather have something else.
- It's a tasty burger.

739
00:45:22,682 --> 00:45:24,411
Red meat...

740
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:27,579
quite often
doesn't agree with me.

741
00:45:41,835 --> 00:45:44,668
Am I gonna make it
to my speech tomorrow morning?

742
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:48,071
I don't know, man.
That ain't a priority to me.

743
00:45:48,108 --> 00:45:50,975
You know what?

744
00:45:51,011 --> 00:45:52,979
You're not
a very nice person.

745
00:45:53,013 --> 00:45:56,312
You don't care about anyone,
you don't trust anyone.

746
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:58,510
Trust can
get you dead.

747
00:45:58,551 --> 00:46:01,315
"Trust can
get you dead."

748
00:46:01,354 --> 00:46:03,982
Well, there's not
one person

749
00:46:04,024 --> 00:46:06,288
- in this world that you trust?
- Nope.

750
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:08,954
- Your mother?
- Oh, hell, no.

751
00:46:08,995 --> 00:46:12,761
How can you not
trust your mother?

752
00:46:12,799 --> 00:46:14,926
- She could be playing me.
- How can a person

753
00:46:14,968 --> 00:46:16,936
go through life
like that?

754
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,029
Hey, at least
I'm honest about it.

755
00:46:19,072 --> 00:46:21,199
What, you trust
everybody you meet?

756
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:23,505
I give everybody
the benefit of the doubt, yes.

757
00:46:23,543 --> 00:46:25,670
And what happens
when they screw you over?

758
00:46:25,712 --> 00:46:27,646
Who's gonna screw me over?

759
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,978
What, do you think people are
just waiting to screw people over?

760
00:46:30,016 --> 00:46:32,416
You think the world
is one big screw-over?

761
00:46:32,452 --> 00:46:35,546
I couldn't live my life like that.
I never met anyone

762
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:37,613
I wasn't friends
with eventually.

763
00:46:37,657 --> 00:46:41,252
Well, I never met anyone whose ass
I didn't kick eventually.

764
00:46:41,294 --> 00:46:44,320
Well, you must
be very proud.

765
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:47,231
Guns and shooting
and kicking ass.

766
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:51,203
You know, problems can be
solved without ever touching a gun.

767
00:46:51,237 --> 00:46:54,070
Situation: You're walking
down the street with your wife,

768
00:46:54,107 --> 00:46:56,075
a guy comes up out of nowhere,
grabs you from behind,

769
00:46:56,109 --> 00:46:58,475
puts a gun to your wife's head.
What do you do?

770
00:46:58,511 --> 00:47:01,480
- Bite him.
- Bite him?

771
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:04,642
Do you have any idea
how powerful the human bite is?

772
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:06,652
The masseter muscles
in the jaw

773
00:47:06,686 --> 00:47:08,881
can exert 600 pounds
of pressure per inch,

774
00:47:08,922 --> 00:47:10,913
and I'm not even
discussing bacteria.

775
00:47:10,957 --> 00:47:12,618
Masseter muscles?

776
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:15,127
- It's Latin.
- It's bullshit.

777
00:47:17,564 --> 00:47:20,260
Come on, finish this shit.
Let's go.

778
00:47:21,468 --> 00:47:24,904
You can afford this,
right?

779
00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:34,879
You all right?

780
00:47:34,914 --> 00:47:37,542
I told you I have
a problem with red meat.

781
00:47:37,584 --> 00:47:39,779
You've gotta admit that was
a good burger, though, right?

782
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,254
You sure
you're all right?

783
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:48,556
Yeah, it doesn't
last long.

784
00:47:58,104 --> 00:48:01,972
Oh! Oh oh, damn!
Let the window down!

785
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:04,306
Oh, it's just a little flatulence.

786
00:48:04,344 --> 00:48:06,039
Oh, "a little flatulence"?

787
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:07,944
An elephant could
take a shit in the back seat,

788
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:11,280
- and it wouldn't smell that bad.
- Can we just let it go?

789
00:48:16,189 --> 00:48:18,350
Oh oh!

790
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:21,690
Oh, man!

791
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:25,127
Oh!

792
00:48:25,165 --> 00:48:27,156
Oh!

793
00:48:37,744 --> 00:48:40,110
All right,
let's do this.

794
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:55,760
This is real simple.

795
00:48:55,795 --> 00:48:58,286
Show 'em the cash,
get a time and a place,

796
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:00,765
and you're back at the hotel giving
your speech tomorrow.

797
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,793
Uh, quick question.
Uh, you can't just go in there

798
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:07,704
and arrest him
because why?

799
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,868
I want his boss
and the guns in the same place

800
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:14,107
at the same time.
That's what this dance is all about.

801
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:16,342
Here, now go.

802
00:49:18,484 --> 00:49:21,317
Remember, this is
strictly flash cash.

803
00:49:21,354 --> 00:49:25,381
Show it to him,
close the bag, bring it back.

804
00:49:25,425 --> 00:49:27,552
Now what if something
goes wrong?

805
00:49:27,594 --> 00:49:29,562
- Nothing will go wrong.
- Yeah, but what if it does?

806
00:49:29,596 --> 00:49:32,121
- Nothing will go wrong.
- Uh, yeah, but what if it does?

807
00:49:32,165 --> 00:49:35,396
What if something goes wrong
and the deal doesn't happen?

808
00:49:35,435 --> 00:49:37,232
I'm gonna be doing this
for the rest of my life!

809
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,898
Nothing will go wrong.

810
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:45,800
Hey, remember...
time and a place.

811
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:48,040
A time and a place.

812
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:54,409
Oh! Son of a bitch!

813
00:50:13,973 --> 00:50:15,804
Hello.

814
00:50:22,115 --> 00:50:25,414
- Ah! Excuse me.
- Hey, just checking for a wire, mate.

815
00:50:25,451 --> 00:50:28,648
- Okay.
- Oh, you're good.

816
00:50:30,556 --> 00:50:32,649
- Well?
- Yes.

817
00:50:39,065 --> 00:50:42,228
- Born lucky. Yeah, am I good?
- Okay.

818
00:50:42,268 --> 00:50:46,261
Oh, I would think.
I would think. Okay.

819
00:50:46,306 --> 00:50:49,139
Great.

820
00:50:51,678 --> 00:50:53,942
Good.

821
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,574
Now...

822
00:50:56,616 --> 00:50:58,880
all we need is
a time and a place,

823
00:50:58,918 --> 00:51:00,886
and we have
ourselves a deal.

824
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,412
And we have ourselves
a little problem.

825
00:51:04,457 --> 00:51:06,049
What?

826
00:51:06,092 --> 00:51:08,390
Nobody...
nobody comes up

827
00:51:08,428 --> 00:51:10,988
with half a million
dollars in cash in an hour.

828
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:13,555
So you tell me...
who are you?

829
00:51:16,269 --> 00:51:18,567
- I'm a businessman.
- Businessman, right.

830
00:51:18,604 --> 00:51:21,767
And what kind of business
is that exactly?

831
00:51:21,808 --> 00:51:23,173
What business?

832
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:29,846
I provide quality
precision tools

833
00:51:29,882 --> 00:51:32,783
to professionals
who demand the very best.

834
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:34,684
Period.

835
00:51:34,721 --> 00:51:37,019
Now are we
gonna do business?

836
00:51:37,056 --> 00:51:39,149
Look, Turk.

837
00:51:39,192 --> 00:51:41,183
I need to speak
to my boss.

838
00:51:43,463 --> 00:51:45,863
Well, why am I talking
to you, Joey?

839
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:47,627
How do you
know my name?

840
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:51,501
Because...
I know your name.

841
00:51:51,537 --> 00:51:53,471
I... I know names.

842
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:57,975
Let's just say
I was born lucky, okay?

843
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,500
You're lucky, huh?

844
00:51:59,545 --> 00:52:03,641
And another thing,
from now on I only talk to Kane.

845
00:52:03,683 --> 00:52:06,982
Look, Turk, you know,
I... I can't just go and tell Kane

846
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:08,987
he should walk away
from a deal he already has in place

847
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:11,012
just 'cause some guy
that he doesn't know

848
00:52:11,057 --> 00:52:12,991
flashes some cash at me.
You understand?

849
00:52:14,227 --> 00:52:17,321
Keep the money.
I don't care about the money.

850
00:52:17,363 --> 00:52:20,093
You think I care about the money?
Don't care about it.

851
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:23,762
I can get money.
Just consider that a good faith deposit.

852
00:52:23,803 --> 00:52:26,397
And you tell Kane
there's a lot more where that came from,

853
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:30,000
but only if he stops
wasting my time.

854
00:52:32,912 --> 00:52:36,177
Oh, one more thing.

855
00:52:36,215 --> 00:52:38,183
From now on...

856
00:52:38,217 --> 00:52:40,708
I call you.

857
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:43,851
- Comprende?
- Comprende.

858
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:47,018
Excuse me.

859
00:52:58,371 --> 00:53:00,339
- Where's the money?
- I gave it to him.

860
00:53:00,373 --> 00:53:02,967
I told him I'd call him
with a time and a place,

861
00:53:03,009 --> 00:53:05,204
and I walked out!
You should have seen it!

862
00:53:05,244 --> 00:53:07,735
You gave a half million dollars
in cash

863
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,806
- to some gun-running killers?
- Correct.

864
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,283
Goddamn you!

865
00:53:15,254 --> 00:53:16,846
Asshole!
Son of a bitch!

866
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:19,722
I've never seen anyone
that pissed off before.

867
00:53:19,759 --> 00:53:21,249
- Okay.
- God damn it!

868
00:53:21,294 --> 00:53:24,593
You said nothing unexpected
would happen, and guess what...

869
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,621
something unexpected
happened!

870
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:29,760
What's to stop them
from taking my money and running?!

871
00:53:29,802 --> 00:53:33,294
Because they know they'd be giving up
a lot more where that came from.

872
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:36,604
He was about to walk.
I had to change the game plan,

873
00:53:36,642 --> 00:53:40,942
- so I'm... I'm now calling the shots.
- Oh, so you in charge now?

874
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,073
- I am indeed.
- You the Man!

875
00:53:43,115 --> 00:53:45,049
Yes. I am the Man.

876
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:47,644
Well, what are we
supposed to do now, Man?

877
00:53:47,687 --> 00:53:51,521
Well, I think we just
let them stew for awhile.

878
00:53:51,557 --> 00:53:53,422
You know what I mean?
And then we call them

879
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:55,757
- in, you know, a couple of hours.
- Well, what do we do

880
00:53:55,795 --> 00:53:57,660
in the meantime, man?

881
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:02,233
We go
to your daughter's recital.

882
00:54:17,984 --> 00:54:20,077
Oh no.

883
00:54:47,046 --> 00:54:49,241
- Daddy!
- Hey, star.

884
00:54:52,485 --> 00:54:54,476
I knew you'd come.

885
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:57,989
Thanks for reminding me
about tonight.

886
00:54:58,024 --> 00:55:00,288
That's the first time

887
00:55:00,326 --> 00:55:02,760
I've heard you say thank you
in a long time.

888
00:55:05,865 --> 00:55:09,232
- I'm sorry.
- "Thank you" and "I'm sorry"?

889
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:11,168
I think your new partner
is a good influence.

890
00:55:11,203 --> 00:55:13,933
- You have no idea.
- Andy, this is Mark.

891
00:55:13,973 --> 00:55:15,873
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

892
00:55:15,908 --> 00:55:18,706
- Vann.
- Mark.

893
00:55:18,744 --> 00:55:21,872
Well, we better go.

894
00:55:21,914 --> 00:55:24,212
- Come on, Katie.
- Come on. Come on, baby.

895
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:30,719
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, honey.

896
00:55:30,756 --> 00:55:33,486
- Can I say something?
- No.

897
00:55:33,526 --> 00:55:36,017
I think you're still
in love with her.

898
00:55:36,062 --> 00:55:38,326
And if you don't get
over this,

899
00:55:38,364 --> 00:55:41,094
you may lose the other
woman in your life.

900
00:55:42,735 --> 00:55:44,726
Just a thought.

901
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:50,972
- You were so pretty.
- Well, Barney Bunny

902
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:54,002
should be in the bottom
dresser drawer, honey,

903
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:56,981
because that's
his very own bed. Oh.

904
00:55:57,016 --> 00:55:59,780
Oh, good, sweetheart,
don't you feel better?

905
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:02,947
Okay, honey,
is Mommy there?

906
00:56:04,957 --> 00:56:08,723
Hi, Susan. Oh, no no,
things are fine, yeah.

907
00:56:08,761 --> 00:56:11,161
Yeah, convention's
going great great great.

908
00:56:11,197 --> 00:56:13,893
You know, I'm...
I'm the Man.

909
00:56:13,933 --> 00:56:16,629
Yes, I'm going to be home
tomorrow night,

910
00:56:16,669 --> 00:56:18,466
so I'll, uh...
I'll see you then.

911
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:21,473
I love you too, hon.

912
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:23,498
Bye.

913
00:56:25,411 --> 00:56:27,208
Thanks.

914
00:56:27,246 --> 00:56:29,237
Why don't we go ahead
and do this thing

915
00:56:29,281 --> 00:56:31,306
- so you can get back to your family?
- Really?

916
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:33,375
Just do this one thing,
and you're done.

917
00:56:33,419 --> 00:56:36,320
Okay. Question:

918
00:56:36,355 --> 00:56:39,381
When you say "done,"
do you mean "done" as in finished,

919
00:56:39,425 --> 00:56:43,384
as in no more,
nothing else, "done"?

920
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:44,657
Make the call.

921
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:02,180
I've a question.

922
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:04,409
Um, isn't it normal

923
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:07,613
to have, uh... you know,
some... some kind of backup, uh,

924
00:57:07,653 --> 00:57:09,621
for a situation
like this?

925
00:57:09,655 --> 00:57:13,648
- I didn't hear you call for any backup.
- That's right.

926
00:57:13,693 --> 00:57:17,322
- Oh.
- Here we go.

927
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:24,792
My hands are sweaty.

928
00:57:24,837 --> 00:57:26,668
Just be the Man.

929
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:38,647
Who's this?

930
00:57:38,684 --> 00:57:41,847
Well, I came to meet
your associate.

931
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,355
- This is my associate.
- Well, you know what?

932
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:48,019
- He looks like a cop.
- He does.

933
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:51,518
He does look like a cop,
but he is most definitely not a cop,

934
00:57:51,564 --> 00:57:53,725
so let's put that to bed
right here and now.

935
00:57:53,766 --> 00:57:56,166
- So like I said, Turk, who is he?
- Who is he?

936
00:57:56,202 --> 00:58:00,161
He's, uh... my bitch.

937
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:01,901
Your bitch?

938
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:05,377
He's my own personal bitch.
Hey, bitch, come here.

939
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:10,415
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

940
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:13,475
I pull the strings,
and he dances.

941
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:15,510
Is that right?
You his bitch?

942
00:58:15,554 --> 00:58:18,216
Why don't you
answer the man?

943
00:58:18,257 --> 00:58:20,225
You can talk, bitch.

944
00:58:20,259 --> 00:58:22,227
I want to hear
you say it.

945
00:58:22,261 --> 00:58:24,889
Who's my bitch?

946
00:58:31,237 --> 00:58:33,831
- I am.
- I didn't hear that. Did you hear that?

947
00:58:33,873 --> 00:58:35,841
- No.
- I couldn't hear anything.

948
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:39,436
We can't hear.
Who's my bitch?

949
00:58:43,516 --> 00:58:47,077
- I'm his bitch.
- Attaboy.

950
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,385
All right,
well, get in... bitch.

951
00:58:51,423 --> 00:58:53,618
Why don't you get
in the back, bitch?

952
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,054
- Crotch-grabbing time?
- Yeah yeah, we'll take care of it.

953
00:58:58,097 --> 00:59:00,065
- Get in.
- All right.

954
00:59:15,181 --> 00:59:17,979
- So where's your guy?
- He's here.

955
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:21,714
- Where?
- You're looking at him, asshole.

956
00:59:21,754 --> 00:59:24,882
I am Kane.
Eh, you can still call me Joey,

957
00:59:24,924 --> 00:59:28,291
I answer to both.
The real question is... who are you?

958
00:59:28,327 --> 00:59:30,295
I'm the man with the money.

959
00:59:30,329 --> 00:59:33,321
Better yet,
I'm the only man with the money.

960
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:35,458
There's just one small
problem, money man.

961
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:38,231
- What's that?
- I think you're a cop.

962
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,465
Oh. Yeah, I am.

963
00:59:40,506 --> 00:59:43,737
- Huh.
- My name is Vann. Wade was my partner.

964
00:59:43,776 --> 00:59:46,336
I've been tracking what he was doing
from the very beginning.

965
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:49,404
Could have busted him,
you, your whole gang,

966
00:59:49,448 --> 00:59:51,439
but I was waiting
for the right time.

967
00:59:51,483 --> 00:59:53,451
I want in.

968
00:59:53,485 --> 00:59:58,320
It's true.
He's A.T.F.

969
00:59:58,357 --> 01:00:00,348
- So you knew about the heist, huh?
- Hell, yeah.

970
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:02,826
Think I don't know
what my partner's doing?

971
01:00:02,862 --> 01:00:05,592
How do I know you're not here to settle
the score for your dead partner?

972
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:08,259
Please. He played
in the rain; he got wet.

973
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,165
So you just wait for your moment
and this is it?

974
01:00:10,202 --> 01:00:14,002
I can take the heat off you
from the inside and I can move the guns.

975
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:16,405
You know I got the money,
'cause my man here

976
01:00:16,442 --> 01:00:19,343
just gave you that half million dollars
like it wasn't nothing.

977
01:00:19,378 --> 01:00:21,846
You're not the only one
with connections, Agent Vann.

978
01:00:23,048 --> 01:00:26,381
- I have a buyer.
- You had a buyer.

979
01:00:26,418 --> 01:00:30,081
Manny Cortez. Unfortunately,
somebody put a.45 slug in him.

980
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:33,819
The same kinda bullet they
took out of my partner, Wade.

981
01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:36,054
Now, some people might
call that a coincidence,

982
01:00:36,095 --> 01:00:38,563
but I don't believe
in coincidences. Do you?

983
01:00:38,597 --> 01:00:40,064
Not really.

984
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:42,033
See, I figured you'd
take my deal over Manny's

985
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:43,591
because you're greedy.

986
01:00:43,636 --> 01:00:45,661
But now I see you're
just plain desperate.

987
01:00:45,704 --> 01:00:48,867
You're stuck with a truckload
of guns and no buyer.

988
01:00:50,409 --> 01:00:53,867
So what's it
gonna be, Joey... Kane?

989
01:00:53,913 --> 01:00:56,814
You've got it all figured out,
haven't you, Agent Vann?

990
01:01:03,555 --> 01:01:05,955
We'll see.
Let's go.

991
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:07,982
Enjoy your swim, ladies.

992
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:19,627
Tell me you didn't
pee in the pool.

993
01:01:25,411 --> 01:01:26,969
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

994
01:01:27,012 --> 01:01:29,207
We gonna make
a deal with this cop?

995
01:01:29,248 --> 01:01:31,216
Get in. Vin.

996
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,241
Go. Now.

997
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,602
- Well, I guess this is it.
- Yeah.

998
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:55,732
You can go back to the world
of dental supply.

999
01:01:55,774 --> 01:01:57,571
Oh, ho-ho yeah.

1000
01:01:57,609 --> 01:01:59,406
Yeah.

1001
01:01:59,445 --> 01:02:02,539
Listen, if you want to show up tomorrow,
you know, I can make it happen.

1002
01:02:02,581 --> 01:02:04,446
No, I'm still in the middle
of this thing.

1003
01:02:04,483 --> 01:02:06,075
Oh, yeah yeah
yeah, well, sure.

1004
01:02:06,118 --> 01:02:08,279
Ah, just a thought.

1005
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:12,380
It's been interesting.

1006
01:02:15,594 --> 01:02:17,994
Yeah, well...

1007
01:02:23,435 --> 01:02:26,404
Hey, maybe next time
I'm in town, I'll look you up.

1008
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:30,406
Or not.
It doesn't, uh...

1009
01:02:30,442 --> 01:02:32,410
D... boy.

1010
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:34,912
I hate
these long goodbyes.

1011
01:02:34,947 --> 01:02:36,676
So, uh...

1012
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,848
Well... see you later.

1013
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:43,753
- Yeah, you take it easy.
- Okay.

1014
01:03:01,807 --> 01:03:05,368
We in the exciting field
of dental supply sales

1015
01:03:05,411 --> 01:03:08,710
have been on the cutting edge
of technology and science

1016
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:11,648
for many years.
And especially today,

1017
01:03:11,683 --> 01:03:14,083
be it porcelain veneers,

1018
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:16,144
be it dental implants

1019
01:03:16,188 --> 01:03:18,156
that are fast eliminating

1020
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:20,181
the use of dentures
and bridges

1021
01:03:20,225 --> 01:03:22,250
in patients' mouths,

1022
01:03:22,294 --> 01:03:25,127
be it the use
of carbamide peroxide

1023
01:03:25,164 --> 01:03:27,792
in combination
with ultraviolet light

1024
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:30,165
that has cut
teeth bleaching down

1025
01:03:30,202 --> 01:03:34,195
to a one-hour-
one-time visit.

1026
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:37,799
Yes, we pledge

1027
01:03:37,843 --> 01:03:40,243
another year of excellence
in the field.

1028
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:42,804
And finally, we are here...

1029
01:03:42,848 --> 01:03:46,477
"To provide quality,
precision tools

1030
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:50,181
to professionals
who demand the very best!"

1031
01:03:50,222 --> 01:03:52,520
Thank you!

1032
01:03:52,558 --> 01:03:54,549
Thank you!

1033
01:03:57,563 --> 01:03:59,394
Thank you!

1034
01:04:00,432 --> 01:04:03,162
Thank you.

1035
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:07,365
Oh, you killed them!

1036
01:04:07,406 --> 01:04:09,397
- You killed, Andy.
- You think? Yes!

1037
01:04:10,742 --> 01:04:12,710
- Oh! Yes?
- Mr. Fiddler.

1038
01:04:12,744 --> 01:04:14,735
Come with us.

1039
01:04:20,452 --> 01:04:22,511
- Where are you taking me?
- Watch your head.

1040
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,390
He said I was done.
Uh, what is going on?

1041
01:04:34,433 --> 01:04:36,458
We're hoping you might
tell us, Mr. Fiddler.

1042
01:04:36,502 --> 01:04:38,470
Look, I don't know
who you people think I am.

1043
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:40,904
We know exactly who you are.
What we don't know

1044
01:04:40,939 --> 01:04:44,306
is how a guy like you
could go so wrong so fast.

1045
01:04:46,645 --> 01:04:49,637
Here you are meeting
a gun runner from overseas

1046
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:50,705
name of Joey Trent.

1047
01:04:50,749 --> 01:04:52,182
And here you are
doing the 411

1048
01:04:52,217 --> 01:04:55,448
with Hector Babcock,
a.k.a. Booty,

1049
01:04:55,487 --> 01:04:58,786
a gun dealer who we just
found in the trunk of his own car.

1050
01:04:58,824 --> 01:05:00,519
You've been running
with a rough crowd,

1051
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,823
but you might be confused
about who the real bad guy is...

1052
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:04,954
Agent Derrick Vann,
your new best friend.

1053
01:05:04,997 --> 01:05:06,965
He's the one that put the bullet
through Booty's head.

1054
01:05:06,999 --> 01:05:09,024
Oh, no.

1055
01:05:09,067 --> 01:05:10,500
- He wouldn't do that.
- No?

1056
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:12,527
- No.
- Check out Manuel Cortez.

1057
01:05:13,805 --> 01:05:16,330
Another gun dealer
Vann paid a visit to.

1058
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:18,866
Last but not least,
his own partner,

1059
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:22,039
or ex-partner
I should say.

1060
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,945
So you have
a dead A.T.F. Agent,

1061
01:05:23,982 --> 01:05:26,007
a dead snitch
and a dead gun runner.

1062
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:27,746
The only connection?
Agent Vann.

1063
01:05:27,786 --> 01:05:30,619
Yeah, well, I-I...
I don't believe that.

1064
01:05:30,656 --> 01:05:32,419
Why not? 'Cause he's
such a nice guy?

1065
01:05:32,457 --> 01:05:35,085
Why do you think
he never called for backup?

1066
01:05:36,261 --> 01:05:38,252
He didn't
want cops around.

1067
01:05:39,665 --> 01:05:41,690
I don't know anything.
I... I...

1068
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:43,598
- That's bullshit!
- I don't know anything!

1069
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:45,364
That's bullshit!
You're up to your neck in it, pal.

1070
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:47,872
- What do you want from me?
- You're gonna wear a wire

1071
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:49,771
and get Vann to admit
he was in on the heist

1072
01:05:49,808 --> 01:05:51,901
and he killed his partner.

1073
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:54,504
- Oh, is that all?
- You don't have a choice.

1074
01:05:54,546 --> 01:05:57,606
Really? What if I just
say "No, thank you"?

1075
01:05:57,649 --> 01:05:59,344
Then the U.S.
Department of Justice

1076
01:05:59,384 --> 01:06:01,079
will take
a giant shit on you.

1077
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:03,110
H... how very pleasant.

1078
01:06:04,122 --> 01:06:06,181
Believe me, Mr. Fiddler,
your best option

1079
01:06:06,225 --> 01:06:08,625
is to go along with this
S.W.C., that's "Suspect..."

1080
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:10,958
"Suspect Who's Cooperating."
I know, I've been that.

1081
01:06:10,996 --> 01:06:12,987
It, uh, didn't
work out too well.

1082
01:06:15,033 --> 01:06:16,660
Uh, let me get this straight.

1083
01:06:16,702 --> 01:06:19,466
You sprung him from holding,
gave him half a million dollars,

1084
01:06:19,504 --> 01:06:21,199
then you let him go?

1085
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,764
The guy's a salesman
from out of town.

1086
01:06:22,808 --> 01:06:25,140
Oh, really? You think
it was a coincidence

1087
01:06:25,177 --> 01:06:26,769
that he showed up
at exactly the right place

1088
01:06:26,812 --> 01:06:28,871
at exactly the right
time in the diner?

1089
01:06:28,914 --> 01:06:30,575
I don't believe in coincidence.
For all you know,

1090
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:34,279
- he could be an undercover I.A. Agent.
- Did you ever check him for a wire?

1091
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,152
I didn't have to. The guy was
scared shitless half the time.

1092
01:06:37,189 --> 01:06:40,352
I can't believe that you
of all people bought his story,

1093
01:06:40,392 --> 01:06:41,859
Mr. I-Don't-Trust-Nobody.

1094
01:06:41,893 --> 01:06:43,861
How'd you get
so stupid so fast?

1095
01:06:43,895 --> 01:06:45,385
Now they got you
tied to the heist,

1096
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:48,024
your partner's murder
and your snitch.

1097
01:06:48,066 --> 01:06:50,364
Booty's dead.

1098
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:54,038
Remember, this guy
is a stone killer,

1099
01:06:54,072 --> 01:06:56,302
if he senses anything wrong,
he'll toe-tag your ass.

1100
01:06:56,341 --> 01:06:58,707
I just need
to get a sound check.

1101
01:06:58,744 --> 01:07:00,905
- You want me to say something?
- Good, I got it.

1102
01:07:00,946 --> 01:07:02,675
- Good, I got it.
- I got it.

1103
01:07:02,714 --> 01:07:05,376
- I got it.
- Hey. Hey, I said I got it.

1104
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:07,385
I don't think I can do this.

1105
01:07:07,419 --> 01:07:09,580
Just do this one thing
for us and you're done.

1106
01:07:09,621 --> 01:07:12,681
Okay, you know what?
You guys have got to stop saying that.

1107
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:14,316
The guy helped
me set up a buy

1108
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:16,452
that's gonna go
down any time now.

1109
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:19,430
What I need from you
is an assault unit to back me up.

1110
01:07:19,464 --> 01:07:21,932
Forget it. I want your badge
and your gun. You're on suspension.

1111
01:07:21,967 --> 01:07:23,696
Bullshit.

1112
01:07:23,735 --> 01:07:25,794
Your badge
and your gun now!

1113
01:07:25,837 --> 01:07:28,704
- You're serious?
- I'm trying to protect you.

1114
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,937
We got a dead agent on our hands
and I can't account for one damn thing

1115
01:07:31,977 --> 01:07:33,877
you've done
for the past 24 hours,

1116
01:07:33,912 --> 01:07:36,642
except lose a lot of money and make
best friends with the I.A. Agent

1117
01:07:36,682 --> 01:07:38,775
who's gonna
bust your ass.

1118
01:07:38,817 --> 01:07:41,081
And that look
does not scare me.

1119
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,213
I am one inch away.

1120
01:07:44,256 --> 01:07:47,157
An inch too far, okay?
Gun and badge.

1121
01:07:57,903 --> 01:08:00,667
You're wrong.
The guy's at a convention

1122
01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:02,401
right now, giving a speech.

1123
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:05,933
Really? Then who's
that standing behind you?

1124
01:08:12,818 --> 01:08:15,150
Guess who?

1125
01:08:15,187 --> 01:08:17,917
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I knew you were gonna ask.

1126
01:08:17,956 --> 01:08:20,618
I, uh, just
finished my speech,

1127
01:08:20,659 --> 01:08:22,752
and I had a little
time before my flight

1128
01:08:22,794 --> 01:08:25,524
and thought I would
just stop by and see how you're doing.

1129
01:08:25,564 --> 01:08:27,759
Chit-chat?

1130
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:30,563
Is... is there some place
we can talk?

1131
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:36,605
- Yeah?
- Avenue A, warehouse three, right now.

1132
01:08:36,641 --> 01:08:38,609
Don't forget the money.

1133
01:08:39,978 --> 01:08:42,947
Why don't we, um,
talk in my car? Come on.

1134
01:08:45,016 --> 01:08:47,678
In the car?
We're going to the car.

1135
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:49,311
Over.

1136
01:08:55,026 --> 01:08:57,392
Mission one, vehicle
leaving Michigan and First.

1137
01:08:57,429 --> 01:08:59,659
Okay, I read you,
Air Support.

1138
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:02,792
Stay above audible range
but don't lose them.

1139
01:09:02,834 --> 01:09:04,825
Uh, copy that.

1140
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:07,771
So, where are we headed?

1141
01:09:07,806 --> 01:09:10,832
- Do you want to get a smoothie?
- We're going to see our old friends.

1142
01:09:12,911 --> 01:09:14,845
Oh. Well, I've got
a 5:00 flight,

1143
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,745
so I... I don't know
whether I'll have time to...

1144
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:19,216
- Hey, you wanted to chit-chat?
- Yes, I do.

1145
01:09:19,251 --> 01:09:21,549
- So, let's chit-chat.
- Okay, good.

1146
01:09:21,586 --> 01:09:23,213
- So, how you doing?
- Good.

1147
01:09:23,255 --> 01:09:25,519
You wired?

1148
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:29,253
Yes. Yes, I am wired.

1149
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:31,956
I'm, uh, you know,
white-knuckle flier,

1150
01:09:31,997 --> 01:09:34,295
I... I get
pre-flight anxiety.

1151
01:09:34,332 --> 01:09:36,960
So, I get... I get very anxious
before a flight.

1152
01:09:37,002 --> 01:09:38,867
I didn't think it showed.

1153
01:09:45,444 --> 01:09:48,811
- So, I guess you got your money.
- No, I didn't.

1154
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:50,940
Did you call for backup?

1155
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,713
Do I ever
called for backup?

1156
01:09:53,752 --> 01:09:55,549
No.

1157
01:09:55,587 --> 01:09:57,452
You think I'm dirty.

1158
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:01,425
- You tell me.
- I ain't telling you shit,

1159
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,291
- you I.A. Piece of crap.
- What?!

1160
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:06,456
Thought you had me played, didn't you?
Feeding me all that bullshit

1161
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:09,023
- this whole time.
- I've been feeding you bullshit?

1162
01:10:09,067 --> 01:10:10,864
That's right.
Bullshit!

1163
01:10:10,902 --> 01:10:13,496
Oh, now, you wait
just one minute, mister!

1164
01:10:13,538 --> 01:10:15,938
You shot me,
you dragged me all over town,

1165
01:10:15,974 --> 01:10:19,273
you used me to set up
your dirty deals.

1166
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:21,677
Hey, I've got
news for you, homie,

1167
01:10:21,713 --> 01:10:23,237
I'm not your
bitch anymore!

1168
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:26,079
Now, I want the truth
and I want it now.

1169
01:10:26,117 --> 01:10:29,450
I think you're involved
and I think you killed Booty.

1170
01:10:29,488 --> 01:10:31,820
Aw, shit!
He just blew it.

1171
01:10:35,994 --> 01:10:39,987
- I killed Booty?
- I said, "I think you killed Booty."

1172
01:10:40,031 --> 01:10:42,158
How the hell
did you even know Booty was dead?

1173
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,862
Exactly, how would I know?
I would not know. I wouldn't know,

1174
01:10:44,903 --> 01:10:48,361
so I could not be
more wrong on that point.

1175
01:10:48,406 --> 01:10:50,067
Let's do this, gentlemen.

1176
01:10:50,108 --> 01:10:53,805
- Mmm.
- Inside.

1177
01:10:53,845 --> 01:10:56,939
The target is stopped,
the deal's going down now.

1178
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:16,329
They told me to get
a confession from you.

1179
01:11:16,368 --> 01:11:17,426
I know.

1180
01:11:17,469 --> 01:11:19,596
Shall we?

1181
01:11:21,139 --> 01:11:23,039
Down!

1182
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:26,768
Shots fired,
repeat, shots fired!

1183
01:11:26,811 --> 01:11:28,403
Get me an assault team!

1184
01:11:28,446 --> 01:11:31,210
- Get out.
- We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

1185
01:11:31,249 --> 01:11:33,945
Hey hey!
Just calm down.

1186
01:11:33,985 --> 01:11:36,215
- We are not going to die.
- Oh!

1187
01:11:37,322 --> 01:11:40,416
- Trust me.
- Trust you.

1188
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:49,499
There are the guns,
where's my money?

1189
01:11:49,534 --> 01:11:51,195
Let me ask you something.

1190
01:11:51,236 --> 01:11:55,696
Did he say I was his bitch
or his dumb bitch?

1191
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:59,301
You think I'm just gonna roll
in here with a truckload of cash

1192
01:11:59,344 --> 01:12:01,812
so you can take it from me and kill me?
I look that stupid?

1193
01:12:01,846 --> 01:12:03,837
Well, just in case you are,
I'll speak real slow.

1194
01:12:03,882 --> 01:12:06,112
If you don't have two and a half million
dollars in your car,

1195
01:12:06,151 --> 01:12:08,210
you're both gonna die.
Right now.

1196
01:12:08,253 --> 01:12:10,221
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, why's that?

1197
01:12:10,255 --> 01:12:11,916
'Cause we brought company.

1198
01:12:13,124 --> 01:12:14,591
You son of a bitch.

1199
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:16,491
- You're under arrest.
- That's a cue.

1200
01:12:16,528 --> 01:12:19,861
What's my assault team's ETA?
I need 'em here now.

1201
01:12:19,898 --> 01:12:23,197
So, tell me...
which one of you Spice Girls

1202
01:12:23,234 --> 01:12:25,429
- blew my partner away?
- That would be me.

1203
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,131
So, I guess that makes you
Scary Spice.

1204
01:12:27,172 --> 01:12:28,764
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1205
01:12:28,807 --> 01:12:30,934
Gentlemen, let's not
lose our heads here.

1206
01:12:30,976 --> 01:12:33,308
'Cause we all have people
we want to see again.

1207
01:12:33,345 --> 01:12:35,210
I have a family.

1208
01:12:35,246 --> 01:12:37,077
And you have a daughter,
I'm sure you have someone.

1209
01:12:37,115 --> 01:12:39,640
- I have no one.
- Well, let me finish.

1210
01:12:39,684 --> 01:12:42,175
You have someone not in the traditional
sense of having someone...

1211
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,710
Well, fucking now
I have you.

1212
01:12:43,755 --> 01:12:45,552
I have got to learn
to stop talking.

1213
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:47,217
- Now back off!
- Or what?

1214
01:12:47,258 --> 01:12:51,160
- Do I really need to say it?
- You shoot him; I shoot you.

1215
01:12:51,196 --> 01:12:52,754
Better yet,

1216
01:12:52,797 --> 01:12:54,788
this gun can put a hole
through both of you.

1217
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:56,926
- You won't do that.
- Wanna bet?

1218
01:12:56,968 --> 01:12:58,595
You won't shoot
your friend.

1219
01:12:58,637 --> 01:13:00,366
Ah, yes, he would
and he did,

1220
01:13:00,405 --> 01:13:01,872
- but I hope he won't.
- Shut up.

1221
01:13:01,906 --> 01:13:03,601
Nigel, take his gun.

1222
01:13:06,745 --> 01:13:10,010
Now, you give your gun to Nigel
and you get on your knees slowly.

1223
01:13:10,048 --> 01:13:12,414
Let it go.

1224
01:13:13,652 --> 01:13:15,210
You're alone, Agent Vann.

1225
01:13:15,253 --> 01:13:16,720
It might appear
that way,

1226
01:13:16,755 --> 01:13:19,383
but my man Masseter's
got my back.

1227
01:13:19,424 --> 01:13:22,120
- Who?
- Mr. Masseter.

1228
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,288
Latin dude.
600 pounds of power.

1229
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:27,321
Nice try.

1230
01:13:27,365 --> 01:13:29,060
See, now I'm gonna
count to three,

1231
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,897
and if you don't give
your gun to Nigel

1232
01:13:30,935 --> 01:13:32,926
and get on your knees,

1233
01:13:32,971 --> 01:13:34,962
I'm gonna put a bullet
between your eyes.

1234
01:13:35,974 --> 01:13:37,441
One, two...

1235
01:13:37,475 --> 01:13:38,942
Three!

1236
01:13:40,645 --> 01:13:43,170
Ah! Oh!

1237
01:13:43,214 --> 01:13:44,772
Move in now, go!
Go! Go!

1238
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:49,577
Oh!

1239
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:52,749
Ah! Oh! Oh!

1240
01:13:54,459 --> 01:13:57,053
- SWAT team! Don't move!
- Shit!

1241
01:14:10,108 --> 01:14:12,167
Go! Go! Go!

1242
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:17,776
Are you alive?
Oh! Are you hit?

1243
01:14:17,816 --> 01:14:20,546
- Yeah.
- Where?

1244
01:14:23,054 --> 01:14:25,318
In my ass.

1245
01:14:26,324 --> 01:14:29,384
In your ass?
Let me take a look.

1246
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:32,521
Oh, shit!
Get off me!

1247
01:14:32,564 --> 01:14:34,395
I'll get
the taco sauce.

1248
01:14:36,668 --> 01:14:38,932
- All right. Easy.
- On your face! Get down! Now!

1249
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:41,564
- All right, let's go!
- Watch your right! Watch your right!

1250
01:14:51,516 --> 01:14:53,950
Can I assume
that Agent Vann

1251
01:14:53,985 --> 01:14:55,816
has been cleared
by Internal Affairs now?

1252
01:14:55,854 --> 01:14:57,754
No, not so fast. I want
to see every penny of that money.

1253
01:14:59,657 --> 01:15:01,522
Heads up.

1254
01:15:01,559 --> 01:15:05,051
How about now,
you bean-counting moron?

1255
01:15:18,476 --> 01:15:20,444
Look, I appreciate
the ride, I really do,

1256
01:15:20,478 --> 01:15:22,810
but I think I can get
on a plane by myself.

1257
01:15:22,847 --> 01:15:24,838
Yeah, I'm sure you can,

1258
01:15:24,883 --> 01:15:27,716
but I just want to see
it with my own eyes.

1259
01:15:27,752 --> 01:15:29,549
The white zone

1260
01:15:29,587 --> 01:15:32,556
is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

1261
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:34,558
There is no parking.

1262
01:15:48,606 --> 01:15:50,801
Tell me I didn't hear
what I think I just heard.

1263
01:15:50,842 --> 01:15:53,276
It's really nothing,
I... uh, I wouldn't worry about it.

1264
01:15:53,311 --> 01:15:55,404
- It's nothing.
- Did you eat lunch

1265
01:15:55,446 --> 01:15:58,210
- when you went back to the hotel?
- I had some lunch.

1266
01:15:58,249 --> 01:15:59,739
What did you have
for lunch exactly?

1267
01:15:59,784 --> 01:16:02,617
- I had a sandwich.
- What kind of sandwich?

1268
01:16:04,489 --> 01:16:06,286
Steak sandwich.

1269
01:16:11,796 --> 01:16:14,458
Shit! You rotten-ass
son of a bitch!

1270
01:16:14,499 --> 01:16:16,296
- Oh my.
- Sisters.

1271
01:16:18,203 --> 01:16:20,398
Oh... woo! Woo!

1272
01:16:20,438 --> 01:16:22,429
Oh, sweet Jesus!

1273
01:16:26,911 --> 01:16:29,175
This is the boarding call...

1274
01:16:38,456 --> 01:16:40,515
Right through,
please, sir.

1275
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:43,083
You're fine.
Sir, right through.

1276
01:16:43,127 --> 01:16:45,152
Uh...

1277
01:16:46,631 --> 01:16:49,099
Um, sir, could you
come with me, please?

1278
01:16:53,671 --> 01:16:55,662
On the mat, please.

1279
01:16:58,343 --> 01:17:01,744
Arms straight out.
That's it, thank you.

1280
01:17:01,779 --> 01:17:04,247
Huh.

1281
01:17:04,282 --> 01:17:06,216
Uh...

1282
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:10,446
Is there something
in your butt, sir?

1283
01:17:10,488 --> 01:17:12,683
Yeah. A bullet.

1284
01:17:12,724 --> 01:17:15,284
It's permanently
lodged in my ass

1285
01:17:15,326 --> 01:17:18,159
that I received
in the line of duty,

1286
01:17:18,196 --> 01:17:21,859
- saving his ass.
- I can vouch for that.

1287
01:17:23,534 --> 01:17:25,832
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step behind the screen, please, sir.

1288
01:17:28,773 --> 01:17:30,331
I'm gonna need to get
a cavity search team, please.

1289
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,070
Oh, hell, no!
That ain't happening!

1290
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:35,375
- No no no no no no.
- Sir, uh, you cannot step

1291
01:17:35,413 --> 01:17:36,539
- past this point...
- Don't worry.

1292
01:17:36,581 --> 01:17:38,572
I am never going
past this point.

1293
01:17:38,616 --> 01:17:41,983
See what you done?
I can't even leave town now.

1294
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:44,011
Sorry.

1295
01:17:46,557 --> 01:17:49,082
Well, I guess
I should get going.

1296
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:53,223
You say goodbye to your beautiful
little ballerina for me.

1297
01:17:53,264 --> 01:17:56,233
Mmm. Tell yours
I said hello too.

1298
01:17:56,267 --> 01:17:58,258
Oh.

1299
01:18:00,338 --> 01:18:02,465
- Well...
- Whoa whoa, hey hey!

1300
01:18:02,507 --> 01:18:04,839
- Let's not and say we did.
- Okey-dokey.

1301
01:18:14,752 --> 01:18:18,119
Told you I never met anyone
I wasn't friends with eventually.

1302
01:18:20,224 --> 01:18:22,454
Bye, Vann.

1303
01:18:22,493 --> 01:18:24,051
Andy.

1304
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:35,898
- Cavity search team?
- Yes, sir.

1305
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,567
Where the hell
you guys been?

1306
01:18:37,608 --> 01:18:39,439
Guy's getting away.

1307
01:18:39,477 --> 01:18:41,104
Grey plaid suit,
brown bag.

1308
01:18:41,145 --> 01:18:43,113
Hurry!

1309
01:18:43,147 --> 01:18:45,115
Sir! Excuse me, sir!

1310
01:18:45,149 --> 01:18:47,709
Sir! Excuse me, sir!

1311
01:18:47,752 --> 01:18:49,447
# All right... #

1312
01:18:49,487 --> 01:18:52,183
Yeah yeah, we, uh, need
to perform a cavity search, please.

1313
01:18:52,223 --> 01:18:54,088
- What? What?
- Yeah, just this way.

1314
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:57,094
Who's my bitch?

1315
01:18:57,128 --> 01:18:59,824
- Uh, it'll just take a few minutes.
- I have done nothing wrong!

1316
01:19:01,232 --> 01:19:02,597
# It's your thing #

2
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,832
When I start out to make
a fool of myself...

3
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,707
there's very little can stop me.

4
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,919
If I'd known where it would end,
I'd have never let anything start...

5
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,332
if I'd been in my
right mind, that is.

6
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,484
But once I'd seen her...
once I'd seen her...

7
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:29,457
I was not in my right mind,
for quite some time.

8
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:38,143
"Good evening," says I, thinking
myself a very gay dog, indeed.

9
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,899
Here was a beautiful girl
all by herself, and me...

10
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:44,239
with plenty of time. Nothing to
do but get myself into trouble.

11
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,234
Some people can smell
danger. Not me.

12
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,488
I asked her if she'd
have a cigarette.

13
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,081
It's my last, I've been looking
forward to it. Don't disappoint me.

14
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,162
But I don't smoke.

15
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:15,262
That's how I found her.
And from that moment on...

16
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:19,983
I did not use my head very much,
except to be thinking of her.

17
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,437
But in the park, in those days...

18
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,281
the rough young fellas used to
be staging hold-ups and the like.

19
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,196
Help! Help!

20
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,866
However, these young fellas
were not professionals.

21
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,544
And that's maybe the reason
why I start out in this story...

22
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:43,671
a little bit like a hero, which
I most certainly am not.

23
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,645
The cab driver was waking up.
He was okay.

24
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,825
So I borrowed his carriage
to drive the lady home.

25
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,069
In a short while,
she recovered herself...

26
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,950
and brightened up, what with
the things I told her...

27
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,623
to get her mind off the scare
she'd had and to set her thinking...

28
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,878
as well, of the brave fella
that had rescued her.

29
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,091
Rosalie, fair Rosalie.

30
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,133
- A name I'm after calling you.
- Rosalie?

31
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,841
Why not? It's a gorgeous,
romantical name entirely.

32
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,758
- I'm Michael.
- You're a character.

33
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,593
I'm just a poor sailor man...

34
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,520
and him with the Princess
of Central Park at his side.

35
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,394
Princess Rosalie. I wonder now:

36
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,223
Where does the princess come from?

37
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,272
I don't know why she
should tell you, but...

38
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,991
Well, her parents were
Russian, White Russian.

39
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,531
You never heard of the place
where she comes from.

40
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:56,285
- Would Her Highness care to gamble?
- Gamble? She's done it for a living.

41
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,327
I'll bet you a dollar I've been
to the place of your birth.

42
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,577
- Zhifu.
- It's on the China coast, Zhifu.

43
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,545
The second wickedest
city in the world.

44
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,588
- The first?
- Macau. Wouldn't you say?

45
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,252
I would. I worked there.

46
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,624
You worked in Macau?

47
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,388
Here's your dollar.
How do you rate Shanghai?

48
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,928
- I worked there, too.
- Yeah, as a gambler?

49
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,852
- Well...
- I hope you were luckier than tonight.

50
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,220
You need more than
luck in Shanghai.

51
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,809
- Do you know what?
- What?

52
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,351
I bet I could drive the car from
down there inside with you.

53
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,695
- There's a police car on the other road.
- Let's get out of the park.

54
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,735
The horse and cart will make it
easy for the cops to find us.

55
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,368
You don't like them very much.

56
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,205
They can struggle without our
doing their work for them.

57
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,542
Watch where you're going, Mac!
Get that nag out of here!

58
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,130
Now the cops are
bound to pick us up.

59
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,923
We'd best leave the
cab here and walk.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,337
- You certainly don't like the police.
- I do not.

61
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,923
My car's right there
in the garage, anyway.

62
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,306
Tell me, Michael...

63
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,096
is there a reason why the
police don't like you?

64
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,275
Well, they've never put
me in jail in America.

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,144
You know, the nicest
jails are in Australia.

66
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,780
The worst are in Spain.

67
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,696
- What law did you break in Spain?
- I killed a man.

68
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,863
Just now, you almost killed a girl.

69
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,457
- Is there a law against that?
- Try it. You won't like the jails here.

70
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,380
They put you in jail for murder
here? I didn't think so.

71
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,955
A man killed his wife
in Frisco last week.

72
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,374
She'd gone to the icebox
for a bit of supper.

73
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,342
He thought she was a burglar, he said.
He shot her five times in the head.

74
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,430
- Number 47!
- He had a good lawyer.

75
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,352
I saw his picture in the paper.
Bainbridge or something.

76
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,144
- Bannister.
- Arthur Bannister.

77
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,563
It said he was the greatest criminal
lawyer, the greatest criminal.

78
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,141
- Some people think he is.
- Here's your car, ma'am.

79
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,270
Send the bill to my husband.

80
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,195
If you're a sailor, Michael,
there's a job for you.

81
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,573
Would you like to work for me?

82
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,455
I-d like it.

83
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,871
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

84
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,966
So are we. To the West Coast,
by way of the Canal.

85
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,626
We're short a man on the crew.

86
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,467
I'll make it worth your while.

87
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,054
Could it be this
you're looking for?

88
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:31,142
You were smart to carry a gun,
travelling alone in the park, but...

89
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,110
if you knew you had
the gun in your bag...

90
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,191
why throw away the bag?

91
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,159
I meant for you to find it.

92
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,996
I don't know how to shoot.

93
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,247
It's easy. You just
pull the trigger.

94
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,802
Some dame, ain't she?

95
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,179
Yeah, and some car.

96
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,760
Evening, Mr. Grisby.

97
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,773
Mr. Bannister sent it all the
way from San Francisco...

98
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,517
just so she could have it here.

99
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,230
- Bannister?
- Arthur Bannister himself.

100
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,813
Some guys have all the luck.

101
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,907
Personally, I don't like a
girlfriend to have a husband.

102
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,370
If she'll fool her husband,
I figure she'll fool me.

103
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,541
Now, New York is not as big a
city as it pretends to be...

104
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:31,755
so I spent the next day in the
hiring hall, waiting for a ship.

105
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:37,590
That way, big boob that I am,
I thought I could escape her.

106
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,467
Don't eat that cigarette.
It'll stunt your growth. Come here.

107
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,511
Excuse me.

108
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:48,393
I wonder if you could help
me locate a Mr. O'Hara.

109
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,890
- Michael O'Hara.
- Mike O'Hara?

110
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,059
You mean, Black Irish,
the big harp that talks fancy?

111
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,823
- I don't know him myself...
- Black Irish?

112
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,527
Yeah, I know him.

113
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,903
Joe. Call Mike O'Hara.
A guy here wants to see him.

114
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,537
Michael O'Hara!

115
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,406
Please step to the bulletin board.
A man wants to see you.

116
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,289
- Shipmates?
- We was in Spain together.

117
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,001
They called him Black Irish
after what he did...

118
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,332
to them finks back in '39.

119
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,252
Mike's got a lot of
blarney in him...

120
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,096
but he knows how to hurt
a man when he gets mad.

121
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,221
You were asking for me?

122
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,515
- O'Hara?
- O'Hara.

123
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,093
You're what they call
an able-bodied seaman?

124
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,813
Well, that's what they call it.

125
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,436
- You ever work on a yacht?
- No.

126
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:37,186
- I presume you can handle a speedboat?
- Well, I presume so.

127
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,857
Do you drink?

128
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,402
- I beg your pardon?
- I asked you if you drink?

129
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:46,078
Whatever's set in front of me.
Doesn't have to be wholesome...

130
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,037
just as long as it's strong.

131
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,744
Do you drink habitually?

132
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:54,453
May I ask, mister, if you're
extending an invitation?

133
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,877
Well, I guess it might as well be.

134
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,382
Now, Mr. O'Hara, if you'll
show me to the nearest bar...

135
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,757
we'll sit down together and discuss
your coming to work for me.

136
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,475
My name is Bannister.

137
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,556
Bannister.

138
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:16,608
Boys, may I present Mr. Arthur Bannister,
the world's greatest criminal lawyer.

139
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:21,024
He'll get you out of anything.
Jake Björnson and Goldie, right?

140
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,606
Goldfish is the name.
Glad to know you.

141
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:27,569
Mr. Bannister's wife sent him to get me.
Isn't that right, Mr. Bannister?

142
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,413
Now Mr. Bannister's going
to buy us all a few drinks...

143
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:35,327
while I entertain myself by
refusing to go to work for him.

144
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,054
You know, Mike saved
my wife's life.

145
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,144
Here. Would you mind
inserting these coins?

146
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,689
Number four.

147
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,141
That's all we like to hear.

148
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:06,076
Mike's quite a hero,
quite a tough guy.

149
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,402
Mister, there ain't no such thing.

150
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,202
No such thing as a tough guy?

151
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,502
What's a tough guy?

152
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,336
I don't know.

153
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,337
A guy with an edge.

154
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,138
What makes him sing better than me?
Something in here.

155
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,509
What makes it loud?
A microphone. That's his edge.

156
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:31,633
Edge?

157
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,642
A gun or a knife, a nightstick or a
razor, something the other guy ain't got.

158
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,898
A little extra reach on a punch,
a set of brass knuckles...

159
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,235
a stripe on the sleeve, a badge
that says cop on it, a rock...

160
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,239
in your hand, or a
bankroll in your pocket.

161
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,575
That's an edge, brother.

162
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,946
Without an edge,
he ain't no tough guy.

163
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:55,450
- You hear that, Black Irish?
- It's true.

164
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,542
Well, bear it in mind.

165
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,589
But what makes him sing
prettier than you?

166
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:14,094
Naturally, someone had to
take Mr. Bannister home.

167
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,020
I told myself I couldn't leave a helpless
man lying unconscious in a saloon.

168
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:23,772
Well, it was me that
was unconscious...

169
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:28,241
and he was exactly as helpless
as a sleeping rattlesnake.

170
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:35,491
Say, it's nice of you, Michael, to
be so nice to me while I'm so drunk.

171
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,590
Lover!

172
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,757
I wasn't sure you'd come.

173
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,508
I'm not staying.

174
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,141
You've got to stay.

175
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,020
Lover!

176
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,024
Gonna be a real nice cruise.

177
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,403
First, the Panama Canal,
then up the Mexican coast.

178
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,482
We need a bosun, Danny-boy.

179
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:10,739
- Ever done any sailing?
- A bit of it.

180
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,866
I saw you last night
at the garage, it was.

181
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,622
Somebody else, Danny-boy, not me.

182
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:20,287
Don't go. She needs
you bad. You stay.

183
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,417
Mike, if you play your cards right,
we can get a job for us both.

184
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,250
I think we'll take it.

185
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:41,223
And what was I, Mike O'Hara,
doing on a luxury yacht...

186
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,567
pleasure cruising in the
sunny Caribbean Sea?

187
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,188
But it's clear now, I was
chasing a married woman.

188
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,739
But that's not the way
I wanted to look at it. No.

189
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:55,534
To be a real prize fathead
like Mike O'Hara...

190
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,750
you've got to swallow whole all the
lies you can think up to tell yourself.

191
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,084
Our little expedition spent some
weeks in the West Indies...

192
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,961
dawdling around, seeing the
sights, laying in supplies...

193
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,547
and getting into more trouble.

194
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,133
Hi, on board the Cercie!

195
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,334
You there...

196
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,174
why don't you go swimming?

197
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,268
I beg your pardon?

198
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,512
I said, why don't you go swimming?

199
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,312
I didn't bring a swimming
suit along on the job, sir.

200
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,943
You ought to the next time.

201
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,733
There won't be a next time, sir.
I'm quitting.

202
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,192
My trunks will fit you. You'll find
them in the locker in the cabin.

203
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,573
I suppose you're wondering
who I am, fella.

204
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,612
- I think I saw you in New York.
- I flew in this morning, by way of Havana.

205
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,495
I'm George Grisby, you know.
Grisby and Bannister.

206
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,076
- Where is everybody? Gone ashore?
- Almost everybody.

207
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,373
- My partner, too, Mr. Bannister?
- That's right.

208
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,503
And the lady?

209
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,062
Mr. Bannister tells me
you once killed a man.

210
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,399
- You are Michael, aren't you?
- That's right.

211
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,643
I'm very interested in murders.

212
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:54,986
Forgive me if I seem inquisitive,
but where'd it happen?

213
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:57,488
- At Murcia.
- How'd you do it?

214
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,779
Now, let me guess.

215
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,992
You did it with your
hands, didn't you?

216
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,083
Does it ever bother you
when you think about it?

217
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,168
What'd he do to you?

218
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,624
Nothing.

219
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,466
You just killed him
for the fun of it?

220
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,255
He was a Franco spy.
There was a war on at the time.

221
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,096
Then it wasn't murder, I suppose?

222
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,137
Tell me, would you do it again?

223
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,642
Would you mind killing another man?

224
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:28,268
I'd kill another Franco spy.

225
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,522
I was on a pro-Franco
committee, fella...

226
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,603
during the Spanish War.

227
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,818
Would you kill me if I
gave you the chance?

228
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,031
I may give you the chance.

229
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,401
Michael!

230
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,332
Before Li went ashore did he
make up some lunch for me?

231
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,907
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is there enough for two?

232
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,458
I'm sure I don't know.
Ask Mrs. Bannister.

233
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,626
You ask her.

234
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,715
Would you like a good
paste in the eye, sir?

235
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,511
I wish she'd ask me to go swimming.

236
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,768
She'll ask you.

237
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,900
You wait and see.

238
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,328
Will you help me?

239
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,210
Give me a cigarette.

240
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,176
I'm learning to smoke now.

241
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,136
Ever since that night
in the park...

242
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:48,259
I've been getting the habit.

243
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,398
Do all rich women
play games like this?

244
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,653
Call me Rosalie.

245
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,469
- I didn't think you would do that.
- I didn't either.

246
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,844
You're scared, aren't you?

247
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,478
You're scared.

248
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,267
I'm scared, too.

249
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,104
You think you needed
me to help you?

250
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,993
You're not that kind. If you need
anything, you help yourself.

251
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,863
I'm not what you think I am.
I just try to be like that.

252
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:53,710
Keep on trying. You might make it.

253
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,796
What are we scared of?

254
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:12,136
So long, kiddies!

255
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,146
Now he knows about us.

256
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:16,810
I wish I did.

257
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,070
Bye-bye.

258
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:33,156
- Michael.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:37,082
Mr. Grisby has told me something
I'm very sorry to hear.

260
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,369
"But if you kiss me"

261
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,335
Lover, this really concerns
you more than anyone else.

262
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,796
"Don't take your arms away"

263
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:51,476
According to George here,
Michael is anxious to quit.

264
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:58,939
- Did you know about that, Lover?
- No, I didn't.

265
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,647
Shut up, George.

266
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,690
- What's the matter, hours too long?
- No, sir.

267
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,406
How about the money?

268
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,362
- I don't care about that.
- Money doesn't interest you?

269
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,454
- Are you independently wealthy?
- I'm independent.

270
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,117
Of money?

271
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:17,199
Before you write that novel,
you'd better learn something.

272
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,664
You've been travelling the world
too much to find out about it.

273
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,037
That's good, Arthur.

274
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,550
Well, sir...

275
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,345
I've always found it very
sanitary to be broke.

276
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,550
- That's good, too, Arthur.
- Shut up, George.

277
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:35,261
Money cannot bring you health
and happiness, etcetera.

278
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,516
Is that it?

279
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:41,934
Without money, I'd be flat on my back
in the ward of a county hospital.

280
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,313
Look at this yacht. It once
belonged to Jules Bachrach.

281
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,814
The great Bachrach,
who kept me out of his club...

282
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,197
because my mother was
a Manchester Greek.

283
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,160
I got him on perjury.

284
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,696
He died bankrupt. And here I am.

285
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,080
Each man has his own idea
of happiness, of course.

286
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,752
But money is what all
of us have in common.

287
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,251
Take Bessie here.

288
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,835
She used to work for Bachrach.
I pay her more, don't I, Bessie?

289
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,257
Yes, Mr. Bannister.

290
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,680
Her salary means happiness.
It means a home...

291
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,349
three rooms for two families.

292
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,556
Bessie's a grandmother, a widow.
Only one of the boys works.

293
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,976
- Right, Bessie?
- Yes, sir.

294
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,477
Yes, of course it is.

295
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,319
So Bessie goes to church
every Sunday she gets off...

296
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:28,484
and prays to God she'll never be
too old to earn the salary I pay her.

297
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,702
You call yourself independent.

298
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,158
Come around and see me
five years from now.

299
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,746
Aye, aye, sir.

300
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,208
Sing it for us again, Lover.

301
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:51,716
Why do you stand for that, Bessie?
I'm quitting. Why don't you?

302
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,799
You heard him, Mr. Poet.
I need the money.

303
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,350
Talk of money and murder.

304
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:58,720
I must be insane. Or else all
these people are lunatics.

305
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,478
That's why I can't leave.
That poor little child he married.

306
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,105
Somebody's got to take care of her.

307
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:09,317
"Don't hold me

308
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:13,700
"But if you hold me

309
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,956
"Don't take your arms away

310
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:32,595
"Comes a change of heart

311
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:50,188
"Please don't love me

312
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:55,154
"But, if you love me

313
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,365
"Then don't take your lips

314
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,993
"Or your arms, or your love

315
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,218
"away"

316
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,275
So remember, ladies,
use Glosso Lusto.

317
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:39,152
It pleases your hair,
pleases the man you love.

318
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,831
Will you help me?

319
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,372
Love.

320
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:48,581
Do you believe in love
at all, Mrs. Bannister?

321
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,251
Give me the wheel.

322
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:05,146
I was taught to think
about love in Chinese.

323
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:09,141
The way a Frenchman thinks
about "laughter" in French?

324
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:15,564
The Chinese say, "It is difficult
for love to last long.

325
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:21,328
"Therefore, one who loves passionately
is cured of love in the end."

326
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,204
Now that's a hard way of thinking.

327
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:27,501
There's more to the proverb.
"Human nature is eternal.

328
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:33,046
"Therefore, one who follows his
nature keeps his original nature...

329
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,296
"...in the end."

330
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,555
- Lover?
- Yes?

331
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,471
Aren't you glad I talked Michael
into coming along, Lover?

332
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,228
He must have changed
his mind about me.

333
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:52,650
Faith, Mr. Bannister,
I've already told your wife.

334
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:56,106
I never make up my mind
about anything at all...

335
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:59,113
until it's over and done with.

336
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:11,002
I'd like to, but I can't
deny that Mr. Bannister...

337
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,833
did try to give his wife
the things she wanted.

338
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:19,136
She'd said once that
she liked picnics.

339
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,464
We were on our way up
the Mexican coast...

340
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:24,345
when he decided to
stop and give her one.

341
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:30,805
Well, Mr. Bannister's picnic
party was most typical of him.

342
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:36,608
A lot of trouble and a great deal
of money went into it, but...

343
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:41,532
it was no more a picnic
than Bannister was a man.

344
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:45,447
When you hear what I got for you,
you'll say you bought it cheap.

345
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:49,489
We've worked a lot of cases together.
I'll be sorry if we make this the last.

346
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,792
There's a plot against
my life, correct?

347
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:54,715
I'll be murdered. That's the
information you're peddling?

348
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,127
I'm going to be killed.

349
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:59,966
Why, Sid, don't you think
I know about it? All about it?

350
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,389
Now, leave me alone.

351
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,224
I want to enjoy myself.

352
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,666
Michael.

353
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:22,625
I found out about Broome. I tried
to tell you. He isn't a steward.

354
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,713
- He isn't a good one.
- He's a detective.

355
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:28,755
My husband hires him to watch me. He
wants to fix it so I'll never divorce him.

356
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,010
- So he can divorce you?
- I haven't a cent.

357
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:34,769
- He wants to cut me off without a cent.
- Does that matter? It shouldn't.

358
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,270
I told you, sweet, you don't
know anything about the world.

359
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,648
Well, lately, I've been
rounding out my education.

360
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:06,177
I'll say this much for you, Arthur,
when you give a picnic, it's a picnic.

361
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:10,594
- Time for another, Arthur?
- Time for another.

362
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,562
- You know what? Michael still insists...
- What?

363
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,431
I beg your pardon?

364
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,857
I said, what?

365
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,610
Michael still insists on quitting.

366
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,893
Why shouldn't he?

367
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:26,282
No, I think Arthur ought
to try and make him stay.

368
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:27,648
If he wants to go, let him.

369
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,151
But George likes to
have him around.

370
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,570
Michael's so big and strong.

371
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:34,705
He makes a good bodyguard for you.

372
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,708
Isn't that what you said, George?

373
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:38,419
- I don't need one.
- That's right.

374
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:41,422
- Not even a big strong bodyguard?
- Don't make another drink.

375
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:43,582
- With an Irish brogue?
- He's had enough.

376
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:46,381
George thinks Michael's
fallen for you.

377
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,258
And that makes me unhappy,
George hopes.

378
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:52,097
But George is wrong again.

379
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:55,637
Now, Arthur, I didn't say
anything about Michael and Elsa.

380
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,054
Make me another drink, George.

381
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,850
Another Grisby special coming up.

382
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:05,023
You know, you're a
stupid fool, George.

383
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,189
You ought to realise,
I don't mind it a bit...

384
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:10,277
if Michael's in love with my wife.

385
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,615
He's young. She's young.

386
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,168
He's strong.

387
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:24,167
She's beautiful.

388
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,172
Sit down, darling.

389
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,799
Where's your sense of humour?

390
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:37,456
I don't have to listen
to you talk like that.

391
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,998
Yes, you do, Lover.

392
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,184
Now, Arthur, you leave Elsa alone.

393
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,605
Come to think of it...

394
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,323
why doesn't Michael
want to work for us?

395
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,784
Why should he?

396
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:56,200
Why should anyone want
to live around us?

397
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,455
Where's his sense of adventure?

398
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,002
Excuse me, sir.
He's over there eating.

399
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,332
Tell Michael to step
over here for a moment.

400
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,754
Aye, sir.

401
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:14,099
Hey, Mike.

402
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:17,848
They want to see you over there,
Mr. Bannister and them.

403
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,574
Well, Michael.

404
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,327
Well, Mr. Bannister.

405
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,247
My wife's lost her sense of humour.

406
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:40,534
You've lost your sense of adventure.
Sit down. Have a drink.

407
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:44,375
Give him a drink, George,
and don't look so shocked.

408
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,258
Michael may not be in the
social register, but then...

409
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,750
neither are you, anymore.

410
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:58,263
Is this what you do for
amusement in the evenings:

411
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,137
Sit around toasting marshmallows
and call each other names?

412
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:07,110
Sure, if you're so anxious for me
to join the game, I'd be glad to.

413
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,528
I can think of a few names I'd
like to be calling you, myself.

414
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:13,106
But, Michael, that isn't fair.

415
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:15,983
You're bound to lose the contest.

416
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:19,032
We'll have to give you
a handicap, Michael.

417
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:22,162
You should know what
George knows about me...

418
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:25,252
for instance, if you really
want to call me names.

419
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:30,675
And, Michael, if you think
George's story is interesting...

420
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,377
you ought to hear the
one about how Elsa...

421
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:36,381
got to be my wife.

422
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:42,934
Do you want me to tell him
what you've got on me, Arthur?

423
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:50,269
You know, once,
off the hump of Brazil...

424
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:55,488
I saw the ocean so darkened
with blood, it was black...

425
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:59,076
and the sun fainting away
over the lip of the sky.

426
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,990
We put in at Fortaleza...

427
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:04,498
and a few of us had lines out
for a bit of idle fishing.

428
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:06,958
It was me who had the first strike.

429
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:13,336
A shark it was, and then there was
another, and another shark again...

430
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,222
till all about the sea
was made of sharks...

431
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:20,841
and more sharks still,
and no water at all.

432
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:25,722
My shark had torn himself
from the hook...

433
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:30,358
and the scent, or maybe the stain it
was, and him bleeding his life away...

434
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,437
drove the rest of them mad.

435
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:35,650
Then the beasts took
to eating each other.

436
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:40,286
In their frenzy,
they ate at themselves.

437
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:45,953
You could feel the lust of murder,
like a wind stinging your eyes...

438
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:50,250
and you could smell the death
reeking up out of the sea.

439
00:31:51,954 --> 00:31:56,379
I never saw anything worse,
until this little picnic tonight.

440
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:00,723
And do you know, there
wasn't one of them sharks...

441
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:03,809
in the whole crazy
pack that survived.

442
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,228
I'll be leaving you now.

443
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:17,566
George, that's the first time
anyone ever thought enough...

444
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:20,066
of you to call you a shark.

445
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:24,242
If you were a good lawyer,
you'd be flattered.

446
00:32:43,741 --> 00:32:46,838
- Where's Mrs. Bannister?
- I'm sure I don't know, sir.

447
00:32:47,787 --> 00:32:49,958
She adores it here in Acapulco.

448
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,166
So do I, but...

449
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:54,381
It's nice and quaint,
but I want to go back to Frisco.

450
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,382
Mind walking with me, fella?

451
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:59,345
I know all the best places.
You might enjoy it.

452
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:01,808
I want to make you a proposition.

453
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:15,527
Beautiful, isn't it?

454
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:18,904
- The beach, you mean, or the tourists?
- Everything.

455
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:24,033
There's a fair face to the land, surely.
But you can't hide the hunger and guilt.

456
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:26,369
It's a bright, guilty world.

457
00:33:36,377 --> 00:33:39,094
Darling, of course you pay me.

458
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:43,977
What's your guess, Michael?
Think the world's coming to an end?

459
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:48,358
There was a start to the world sometime,
so I guess there'll be a stop.

460
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:55,148
- It's coming, you know.
- Huh?

461
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:58,452
Oh, yeah, it's got to come.

462
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:03,199
First, the big cities...

463
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:06,203
then maybe even this.

464
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:08,830
It's just got to come.

465
00:34:09,118 --> 00:34:12,083
I prefer to be somewhere
else when it does.

466
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:13,551
I will be.

467
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:18,092
That's what I need you for, Michael,
to see to it that I'm not around.

468
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:20,505
- How would you like $5,000?
- What?

469
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:23,387
That's what I said, $5,000, fella.

470
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:27,140
What do I have to do for it?

471
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:31,360
I'll fill in the details later.
Meanwhile, think it over, Michael.

472
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:33,313
$5,000.

473
00:34:34,393 --> 00:34:37,905
It's yours. All you have
to do is kill somebody.

474
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:42,278
Who, Mr. Grisby?
I'm particular who I murder.

475
00:34:44,654 --> 00:34:45,994
Good boy!

476
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:53,088
You know, I wouldn't like
to kill just anybody.

477
00:34:54,538 --> 00:34:58,761
- Is it somebody I know?
- Yeah. But you'll never guess.

478
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:01,140
I give UP-

479
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:02,546
It's me.

480
00:35:03,172 --> 00:35:04,809
I'm perfectly sober, Michael.

481
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:08,145
I'm willing to pay $5,000
if the job is well done.

482
00:35:09,303 --> 00:35:12,566
This is a straightforward
business proposition.

483
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:14,855
I want you to kill me.

484
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,151
So long, fella.

485
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:48,477
- Michael.
- Yes?

486
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,818
- You talked to George yesterday.
- I did.

487
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:59,316
- Did he say anything about us?
- He's afraid the world's going to explode.

488
00:35:59,603 --> 00:36:01,656
He talked about suicide.

489
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:13,793
I've thought of that sometimes.

490
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:15,161
Suicide?

491
00:36:16,662 --> 00:36:18,963
Do you think it's wrong, Michael?

492
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,546
I don't know.

493
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:24,176
Would you kill yourself
if you had to?

494
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:26,844
I don't know.

495
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:32,897
- I've looked at those pills so many times.
- Pills?

496
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:36,150
The ones my husband takes
to kill the pain...

497
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:40,319
and wondered if enough of
them would kill my pain.

498
00:36:40,394 --> 00:36:42,696
The pain of just being alive?

499
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:46,865
Mr. Grisby wants to be cured of
that pain. He wants me to cure him.

500
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:49,909
Mr. Grisby wants me
to kill Mr. Grisby.

501
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:55,538
- I'm sure he's out of his mind.
- He's not sane. Neither is Arthur.

502
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:58,335
Your husband can take
care of himself.

503
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,637
- What do you want?
- Beautiful moon. Nice night for it...

504
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:05,596
ain't it, Mr. O'Hara?

505
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:10,926
You didn't answer me, Mr. O'Hara.

506
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:13,185
You ought to speak
when you're spoken to.

507
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,274
I'd hate to have to report
you to the lady's husband.

508
00:37:16,347 --> 00:37:18,566
I said it's a nice night for it.

509
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:47,087
Would you care to dance with me?

510
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,803
Stop crying-

511
00:37:55,886 --> 00:37:59,315
- I can't stand for you to cry.
- Do you know what Broome's been doing?

512
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,442
Spying. Spying on you.

513
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:05,366
Sure, I'm going to take you
where there aren't any spies.

514
00:38:05,438 --> 00:38:07,277
Michael, where?

515
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:10,864
Along way off, some one
of the far places.

516
00:38:10,943 --> 00:38:13,529
Far place?
We're in one of them now.

517
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:16,455
Running away doesn't
work. I tried it.

518
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:22,045
Everything's bad,
Michael. Everything.

519
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,301
You can't escape it or fight it.

520
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:28,170
You've got to get along with it,
deal with it, make terms.

521
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:32,093
You're such a foolish
knight errant, Michael.

522
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:34,641
You're big and strong,
but you just don't know...

523
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:36,769
how to take care of yourself.

524
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:39,682
So how could you take care of me?

525
00:38:42,683 --> 00:38:44,735
If you'll so pardon
me this intrusion...

526
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,230
there's a couple of
police officers out here.

527
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:48,274
Cops?

528
00:38:50,024 --> 00:38:51,827
I don't speak their language, see?

529
00:38:51,901 --> 00:38:56,741
And they wants me to identify this guy.
What's the Spanish for "drunken bum"?

530
00:39:02,328 --> 00:39:05,674
It was early October when
we made San Francisco...

531
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:10,007
and dropped anchor across the
bay from the city, in Sausalito.

532
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:13,517
It had been a most
interesting cruise.

533
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,520
All very rich and rare and strange.

534
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:19,471
But I had had no stomach for it.

535
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:23,564
To begin with, living on a
hook takes away your appetite.

536
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:28,443
You've no taste for any pleasure at
all, but the one that's burning in you.

537
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:30,573
But even without an appetite...

538
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:33,412
I'd learned it's quite
amazing how much...

539
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:35,822
a fool like me can swallow.

540
00:39:36,362 --> 00:39:38,616
Please, Michael, be careful.

541
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:43,003
The car's down there.

542
00:39:44,078 --> 00:39:47,008
Mr. Bannister's waiting to
take you into the city...

543
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:49,881
to San Francisco. But
you're not going with him.

544
00:39:51,252 --> 00:39:53,138
You're going with me.

545
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,721
You think I can't
take care of you...

546
00:39:58,801 --> 00:40:02,942
and I'd be after running off with you to
an island to eat berries and goat's milk.

547
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:05,350
And I'd have to take in
washing to support you.

548
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:07,023
Hello, kiddies.

549
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:09,942
There's George.

550
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:14,986
What would you say to $5,000,
to get us started?

551
00:40:15,234 --> 00:40:17,868
We've got a date with a
couple of beers, fella.

552
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:20,998
Arthur was asking for you.

553
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:23,667
He wondered where you'd gone.

554
00:40:25,953 --> 00:40:27,674
I won't tell him.

555
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,344
You didn't answer my question.

556
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:33,967
- $5,000.
- Goodbye, Michael.

557
00:40:34,503 --> 00:40:36,425
Couldn't we start on that?

558
00:40:38,924 --> 00:40:42,271
Would you have to take
in washing on $5,000?

559
00:41:00,863 --> 00:41:02,204
Sit down.

560
00:41:04,325 --> 00:41:07,956
I suppose you're wondering what's
behind my little proposition.

561
00:41:08,037 --> 00:41:12,842
It's none of your business, but since
we're what you call "partners in crime"...

562
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:16,511
I'll tell you that the firm of
Bannister & Grisby is insured...

563
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:18,141
against the death
of either partner.

564
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:21,851
That means, if one of us dies the
other stands to get a lot of money.

565
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:25,105
- Thanks. Now, leave us alone.
- Yes, sir.

566
00:41:25,346 --> 00:41:29,356
Like some other people we both know,
I'm not very happily married.

567
00:41:29,725 --> 00:41:31,398
And another thing, frankly...

568
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:34,775
I don't want to be within
1,000 miles of that city...

569
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:39,530
or any other city when they
start dropping those bombs.

570
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:43,039
Michael, there's been a suggestion
we drive you into town.

571
00:41:43,197 --> 00:41:45,036
Want a beer before you go?

572
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:48,295
I'll be waiting with
Mrs. Bannister in the car.

573
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:52,300
Better meet me in my office.
Make it late tonight.

574
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:55,132
- What for?
- $5,000.

575
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:59,013
That ought to take a girl and a
sailor on quite a nice little trip.

576
00:42:01,173 --> 00:42:02,785
I'll meet you at your office.

577
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,588
There's a little paper
I'd like you to sign.

578
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,437
It's nothing very binding
or important, really...

579
00:42:08,556 --> 00:42:10,810
just a confession of murder.

580
00:42:11,475 --> 00:42:12,947
Here's to crime!

581
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:27,120
She say, meet you at aquarium,
9:00, before many people there.

582
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,623
The aquarium?

583
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:35,174
If you ever need a good lawyer,
Michael, let me know.

584
00:42:39,545 --> 00:42:41,218
"I, Michael O'Hara...

585
00:42:41,297 --> 00:42:45,473
"...in order to live in peace with my God,
do freely make the following confession.

586
00:42:45,551 --> 00:42:48,648
"On the evening of August 9..."
That's tomorrow night, fella.

587
00:42:49,263 --> 00:42:51,268
"...I shot and killed
Mr. George Grisby...

588
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:53,899
"...placing his dead corpse
in the Sausalito bay."

589
00:42:53,976 --> 00:42:55,150
Just a minute, sir.

590
00:42:55,227 --> 00:42:58,526
What you are reading there,
am I suppose to have written it?

591
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,910
It's your confession.

592
00:43:00,983 --> 00:43:03,664
This is the easiest $5,000
you'll ever earn, fella.

593
00:43:03,736 --> 00:43:05,408
Why don't you do it yourself?

594
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:08,371
Commit suicide? Me? Don't be silly.

595
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:10,419
Suicide is against the law.

596
00:43:10,493 --> 00:43:12,580
We're not going to break the law.

597
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:16,256
This is going to be murder,
and it's going to be legal.

598
00:43:16,415 --> 00:43:19,133
I want to live, but
I want to vanish.

599
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:22,929
I want to go away and change my
name, and never be heard of again.

600
00:43:23,005 --> 00:43:26,718
But that costs money,
and it isn't easy nowadays.

601
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:31,732
If they're looking for you, they'll find
you, unless they think you're dead.

602
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:35,946
They'll find you even on the
smallest island in the South Seas.

603
00:43:36,602 --> 00:43:40,659
That's where I'm going to be,
fella, on that smallest island.

604
00:43:41,816 --> 00:43:45,197
I'll mail the rest to
you after the murder.

605
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:49,952
I want to live on
that island in peace.

606
00:43:50,032 --> 00:43:54,541
That won't be possible unless the
world is satisfied I don't exist.

607
00:43:55,162 --> 00:43:58,010
You know, the law is a
funny thing, fella.

608
00:43:58,082 --> 00:44:02,258
The State of California will say
I'm dead, officially dead...

609
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:05,257
if somebody'll say
they murdered me.

610
00:44:05,715 --> 00:44:08,051
That's what I'm paying you for.

611
00:44:08,134 --> 00:44:10,221
- To murder you?
- To say you did.

612
00:44:10,303 --> 00:44:12,189
Well, what happens to you really?

613
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:15,027
- Well, I disappear.
- What happens to me?

614
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:16,642
Nothing.

615
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:18,773
That's the joker.

616
00:44:18,853 --> 00:44:21,652
You swear you killed me,
but you can't be arrested.

617
00:44:21,731 --> 00:44:24,530
That's the law.
Look it up for yourself.

618
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:28,488
There's no such thing as homicide,
unless they find a corpse.

619
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:32,085
It just isn't murder if
they don't find a body.

620
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:35,207
According to the law, I'm dead...

621
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,253
if you say you murdered me.

622
00:44:38,331 --> 00:44:41,545
But you're not a murderer
unless I'm dead.

623
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:45,383
Silly, isn't it?

624
00:44:51,594 --> 00:44:53,314
I've never seen an aquarium.

625
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:56,941
Would you show me about?

626
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:02,439
I couldn't think where
else we could meet.

627
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:05,867
- Only tourists and schoolchildren come.
- And lovers.

628
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:07,365
- Michael!
- Fair Rosalie!

629
00:45:07,443 --> 00:45:08,736
- Do you love me?
- I do.

630
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,990
Do you still want to
take me away with you?

631
00:45:11,072 --> 00:45:13,243
- Why do you ask that?
- Tell me where we'll go.

632
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:15,163
Will you carry me off
into the sunrise?

633
00:45:15,242 --> 00:45:18,090
Don't torment me. I'll take care
of you. You won't starve.

634
00:45:18,162 --> 00:45:22,671
I don't care where it is, Michael,
just take me there.

635
00:45:23,292 --> 00:45:24,799
Take me, quick.

636
00:45:26,045 --> 00:45:27,338
Take me.

637
00:45:33,803 --> 00:45:34,846
What?

638
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:38,143
For heaven's sakes,
come along. Come on.

639
00:45:41,686 --> 00:45:44,734
- Come on. Come on.
- Can't I look? I want to see.

640
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,489
I don't want you to worry about us.
I'm making arrangements.

641
00:45:49,568 --> 00:45:52,534
The things you said
yesterday about money.

642
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:55,498
You didn't sound like you.

643
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:59,250
You're not going to try
anything foolish, are you?

644
00:45:59,328 --> 00:46:02,461
I'm afraid so. Something
very foolish indeed.

645
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:10,342
"I, Michael O'Hara, in order to
live in peace with my God...

646
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:12,802
"...do freely make the
following confession."

647
00:46:12,883 --> 00:46:16,229
Read the last part, that
explains the whole of it.

648
00:46:20,391 --> 00:46:23,274
"We arrived at the boat landing
at approximately 10:20.

649
00:46:23,352 --> 00:46:25,820
"Mr. Grisby said he heard a sound.

650
00:46:26,022 --> 00:46:30,530
"He said he was frightened of a hold-up and
asked me to get the gun, just in case.

651
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:33,872
"I reached in and got the gun,
but I'd hardly taken hold of it...

652
00:46:33,946 --> 00:46:36,580
"...when the gun went off
by accident in my hand...

653
00:46:36,657 --> 00:46:39,754
"...and I saw that Mr. Grisby
was all covered with blood.

654
00:46:41,746 --> 00:46:44,711
"It took me a minute to realise
that Mr. Grisby was dead.

655
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:48,254
"To realise that I, Michael O'Hara,
had killed him."

656
00:46:50,463 --> 00:46:52,634
But I don't understand, Michael.

657
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:55,511
What were you doing with
George in Sausalito?

658
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:58,476
It says Mr. Grisby wants to
spend the night on a yacht...

659
00:46:58,554 --> 00:47:00,559
and asked me to drive him there.

660
00:47:01,057 --> 00:47:03,311
And that's where I kill him.

661
00:47:03,392 --> 00:47:05,943
You see, with the rough
tide there is in the bay...

662
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,903
they wouldn't recover the body,
if there was one.

663
00:47:09,774 --> 00:47:11,993
You don't understand, darling.

664
00:47:12,068 --> 00:47:14,618
He isn't dead yet, Grisby's alive.

665
00:47:14,737 --> 00:47:18,996
He won't be murdered until tonight.
Is that foolish enough for you?

666
00:47:19,158 --> 00:47:22,207
My husband wrote that thing
and got you to sign it for him.

667
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:24,422
It's one of those famous
Bannister tricks.

668
00:47:24,497 --> 00:47:26,300
No, it's Grisby's idea.

669
00:47:26,374 --> 00:47:30,051
It seems Mr. Grisby
wants to disappear...

670
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:34,220
and this is a scheme of his
to get himself declared dead.

671
00:47:35,174 --> 00:47:39,480
There's more to it than that, Michael.
I don't know what, but there's more.

672
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:41,641
It's a trap of some kind.

673
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,113
You meet George tonight,
just as he arranged.

674
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:49,903
Go with him to Sausalito
and do whatever crazy...

675
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:54,204
nonsense he asks you to do. As long
as no one's hurt it won't matter.

676
00:47:54,277 --> 00:47:56,246
But don't let him
out of your sight.

677
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,168
Maybe George isn't as big a
fool as he seems to be...

678
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,752
but I'll swear my husband's
behind this whole thing.

679
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:07,293
Michael, why did you let
yourself get dragged into it?

680
00:48:07,373 --> 00:48:11,253
Sure because I'm a fool,
a deliberate, intentional fool...

681
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:14,517
and that's the worst kind.
Or didn't you know?

682
00:48:14,588 --> 00:48:17,306
Yes, my beloved, my beloved fool.

683
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:19,141
I know.

684
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:28,153
I don't think there's
anybody home, just Broome.

685
00:48:28,894 --> 00:48:33,154
Mr. Bannister's in the city, and Mrs.
Bannister, I think, went to the movies.

686
00:48:33,232 --> 00:48:35,533
- Better wait for me in the kitchen.
- Okay.

687
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,195
Make some coffee,
we'll both need it.

688
00:48:38,487 --> 00:48:40,824
I've got things to attend to.

689
00:48:53,044 --> 00:48:54,254
Well?

690
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:57,810
I wonder, am I the only one
that's on to you and her?

691
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:58,511
Who?

692
00:48:58,591 --> 00:49:01,723
Nobody else seems to guess
you're sweet on her.

693
00:49:02,094 --> 00:49:05,938
That ought to be worth extra, but
I'll throw it in for the same price.

694
00:49:06,015 --> 00:49:09,609
- What are you selling?
- I can shut up, that's what I'm selling.

695
00:49:09,685 --> 00:49:12,271
You see, I'm a snoopy
kind of a guy.

696
00:49:12,355 --> 00:49:15,202
I find things out. I get around.

697
00:49:16,192 --> 00:49:18,778
I got around one
afternoon in Sausalito.

698
00:49:18,861 --> 00:49:21,329
I overheard a little
conversation down in Mexico.

699
00:49:21,405 --> 00:49:23,909
I found out about a
little plot of yours.

700
00:49:23,991 --> 00:49:27,704
You wouldn't want me to say nothing
about how you're framing Michael.

701
00:49:27,787 --> 00:49:30,255
Frame him for a murder
you're going to commit.

702
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:33,131
Well, let's talk it over tomorrow.

703
00:49:33,209 --> 00:49:36,673
When you'll be playing dead and
someone we both know is really dead?

704
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:41,144
No, thanks, Mr. Grisby. We'll
settle our account, right now.

705
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:44,396
All right, Broome...

706
00:49:45,638 --> 00:49:47,358
if you insist.

707
00:50:09,662 --> 00:50:11,632
- What are you doing?
- Hello, Michael.

708
00:50:11,706 --> 00:50:13,675
I'm sorry. You drive.

709
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:15,137
Were you shooting a gun?

710
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:18,139
I was just doing a
little target practice.

711
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:21,009
That's what you're going
to say, isn't it...

712
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,594
when you shoot the gun
down by the boat landing?

713
00:50:23,676 --> 00:50:26,096
People come out of the bar
to see what happened.

714
00:50:26,178 --> 00:50:29,607
You're going to say, "I was just
doing a little target practice."

715
00:50:29,932 --> 00:50:32,566
Of course, really,
you're supposed to have shot me.

716
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:34,446
And later, when nobody's looking...

717
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,281
you're supposed to have thrown
my corpse into the bay.

718
00:51:06,052 --> 00:51:07,095
Look out!

719
00:51:08,429 --> 00:51:10,268
What happened back there?

720
00:51:10,348 --> 00:51:11,854
Anybody hurt?

721
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,898
- Kind of banged it up, mister.
- Yes.

722
00:51:16,979 --> 00:51:20,361
It's our fault. Here's my card.
Let me know if there's any damage.

723
00:51:20,441 --> 00:51:22,363
Looks like you got damage.

724
00:51:22,443 --> 00:51:24,744
- Your hand's cut bad!
- Really, it's all right.

725
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,122
- Well, goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mr. Grisby.

726
00:51:27,198 --> 00:51:28,289
Goodnight.

727
00:51:28,366 --> 00:51:30,501
- Did he get a good look at us?
- What?

728
00:51:30,576 --> 00:51:32,877
The truck driver.
He'll make a good witness.

729
00:51:32,954 --> 00:51:34,081
What?

730
00:51:34,163 --> 00:51:37,046
He'll testify he saw us
just before the murder.

731
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:42,464
Broome, are you ill?

732
00:51:43,214 --> 00:51:46,013
I've got some lead in me,
where it hurts.

733
00:51:46,425 --> 00:51:48,596
- I'll call a doctor.
- Did already.

734
00:51:48,844 --> 00:51:51,810
Trouble is, the doc
will report the police.

735
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:55,235
The police will want to know who
was the certain party who shot me.

736
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:57,480
Don't worry, he'll get his.

737
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,781
There's going to be a murder. Ain't
going to be a fake murder this time.

738
00:52:01,857 --> 00:52:03,578
Somebody's going to be killed.

739
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:05,703
- You mean...
- Yeah, your husband.

740
00:52:05,778 --> 00:52:07,913
Maybe he's the one
who'll be knocked off.

741
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:10,124
- What?
- Could be.

742
00:52:10,449 --> 00:52:14,210
You better get down to his office,
if you want to do anything about it.

743
00:52:21,877 --> 00:52:22,981
What are you doing?

744
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:25,913
Getting blood all over
the floor of the car.

745
00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:27,851
My blood. It's perfect.

746
00:52:28,217 --> 00:52:30,981
If you'd shot me, there
would be blood, fella. See?

747
00:52:31,053 --> 00:52:35,775
Now, when you get back to the garage,
start washing out the bloodstains.

748
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:38,104
You're trying to wipe
out the evidence, see?

749
00:52:38,185 --> 00:52:42,527
But be careful not to do such a good job
that they can't analyse the stains.

750
00:52:42,606 --> 00:52:44,493
You can just try to wash that out.

751
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:46,654
Get the gun. It's in
the glove compartment.

752
00:52:46,736 --> 00:52:49,156
Good. Come on now. Let's go.

753
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,467
Be sure enough people in the
bar get a good look at you.

754
00:52:58,539 --> 00:53:00,591
They're bound to ask
about the shooting.

755
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:03,632
Just say you're doing
a little target practice.

756
00:53:04,712 --> 00:53:07,512
Be sure and wait until you
hear the speedboat get away.

757
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:09,476
- Understand?
- Where are you going?

758
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:11,271
Give me that cap!

759
00:53:11,636 --> 00:53:15,147
- What are you laughing at?
- Wait and see.

760
00:53:40,331 --> 00:53:42,585
- Get the law!
- Get back in the house!

761
00:53:47,421 --> 00:53:50,304
You come back in the house.
It's none of your business!

762
00:53:50,383 --> 00:53:54,013
Why don't you let people get
some sleep around here?

763
00:54:00,977 --> 00:54:03,078
What are you doing with that gun?

764
00:54:03,104 --> 00:54:06,008
I was just doing a
little target practice.

765
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:08,444
- Where are you going with it now?
- Is he drunk?

766
00:54:08,526 --> 00:54:10,032
He's soused!

767
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:19,923
San Rafael, please.

768
00:54:26,252 --> 00:54:29,051
Hello. I want to speak
to Mrs. Bannister.

769
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,340
What?

770
00:54:30,423 --> 00:54:31,597
It's me, Broome.

771
00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:34,813
Get down to the office.
Montgomery Street.

772
00:54:35,136 --> 00:54:36,726
You was framed.

773
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:40,144
Grisby didn't want to disappear.
He just wanted an alibi.

774
00:54:40,683 --> 00:54:43,233
And you're it. You're the fall guy.

775
00:54:43,686 --> 00:54:46,865
Grisby's gone down there
to kill Bannister, now.

776
00:54:47,857 --> 00:54:49,031
Hello?

777
00:54:50,985 --> 00:54:52,159
Hello?

778
00:54:52,695 --> 00:54:53,869
Hello?

779
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:07,883
Stop that car! Stop the car!

780
00:55:12,048 --> 00:55:13,139
Am I too late?

781
00:55:13,215 --> 00:55:14,936
- For what?
- To save Mr. Bannister.

782
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:16,931
- Who?
- Arthur Bannister.

783
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:19,146
- That's blood, ain't it?
- Sure, it's blood.

784
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:21,108
- It's all over the seat.
- Where?

785
00:55:21,182 --> 00:55:23,317
- Let go of me!
- There's blood all over him.

786
00:55:23,392 --> 00:55:24,685
- Your name?
- Michael O'Hara.

787
00:55:24,769 --> 00:55:27,153
Listen to this paper
I found on the sidewalk.

788
00:55:27,229 --> 00:55:29,151
I want to know about Mr. Bannister.

789
00:55:29,231 --> 00:55:30,489
Go ahead, Joe.

790
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:34,529
"I, Michael O'Hara, in order to
live in peace with my God..."

791
00:55:34,612 --> 00:55:35,869
Yes, Michael?

792
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:39,494
- You were asking for me?
- Pardon me, please.

793
00:55:39,575 --> 00:55:42,423
- "...freely make the following confession."
- Confession!

794
00:55:42,495 --> 00:55:46,552
"On the evening of August 9,
I shot and killed George Grisby."

795
00:55:46,624 --> 00:55:49,803
Then it wasn't you that was
killed, it was him, Grisby!

796
00:55:50,002 --> 00:55:54,427
Hello, darling. Have you heard the
news? George has been murdered.

797
00:55:54,548 --> 00:55:58,096
He was found here in the street
with Michael's cap in his hand.

798
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,984
Michael is going to
need a good lawyer.

799
00:56:05,184 --> 00:56:06,821
Well, it's my own fault...

800
00:56:06,894 --> 00:56:10,856
but that's how I got into it,
big boob that I am.

801
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,404
I began to ask myself if I
wasn't out of my head entirely.

802
00:56:14,485 --> 00:56:18,198
The wrong man was arrested.
The wrong man was shot.

803
00:56:19,115 --> 00:56:21,998
Grisby was dead and so was Broome.

804
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,747
And what about Bannister?

805
00:56:25,371 --> 00:56:28,918
He was going to defend me
in a trial for my life.

806
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:33,260
And me, charged with a couple
of murders I did not commit.

807
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:37,100
Either me, or the rest of the
whole world is absolutely insane.

808
00:56:43,097 --> 00:56:45,268
- You know my associate, Mr. Seeley.
- Hello.

809
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:48,564
He's arranged for your pass
into the jail. It's in the building.

810
00:56:48,644 --> 00:56:51,064
- Should he take you?
- I'd rather go by myself.

811
00:56:51,147 --> 00:56:53,491
All right, Seeley.
I'll join you in the office.

812
00:56:53,517 --> 00:56:54,102
Okay.

813
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,953
Excuse me, Mrs. Bannister.

814
00:56:59,614 --> 00:57:01,416
You want to be alone with Michael?

815
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,626
- It was your idea.
- Morning, Bannister.

816
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:06,169
Morning, Judge. Is your boy
still in the hospital?

817
00:57:06,245 --> 00:57:08,879
- Been home since Tuesday.
- Well, that's fine, Judge.

818
00:57:08,956 --> 00:57:10,926
- Wasn't it your idea?
- Yes, Lover?

819
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,471
Oh, I beg your pardon.

820
00:57:12,543 --> 00:57:13,966
Wasn't it your idea?

821
00:57:14,045 --> 00:57:16,809
Isn't it your idea to save
Michael from the gas chamber?

822
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:19,135
Arthur Bannister's the
only one who can do it.

823
00:57:19,216 --> 00:57:20,972
What do you think? Hello, Galloway!

824
00:57:21,052 --> 00:57:23,223
Hi, Bannister, how's tricks?

825
00:57:23,554 --> 00:57:26,140
- You know our district attorney, dear.
- How do you do?

826
00:57:26,223 --> 00:57:27,861
Hello, Mrs. Bannister.

827
00:57:27,933 --> 00:57:31,362
I was the murdered man's partner.
The other victim was my servant.

828
00:57:31,437 --> 00:57:36,076
If I defend Michael, any jury will figure
I have reason to believe he's innocent.

829
00:57:36,734 --> 00:57:40,412
And you have reason to believe
that Michael is innocent?

830
00:57:45,368 --> 00:57:50,007
I hear that Galloway is going to say
that Michael took George's corpse...

831
00:57:50,081 --> 00:57:52,335
into the city in our speedboat.

832
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:55,134
- We can prove he didn't.
- George couldn't have taken it.

833
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:57,132
- Why not?
- How could it get back?

834
00:57:57,213 --> 00:57:59,134
- Back where?
- To the yacht, naturally.

835
00:57:59,215 --> 00:58:03,272
The speedboat couldn't have driven
itself. Or maybe it was George's ghost.

836
00:58:03,344 --> 00:58:05,598
Maybe the boat just drifted back.

837
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,067
No, Lover.

838
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:09,690
Michael has got to plead
excusable homicide.

839
00:58:09,767 --> 00:58:12,021
But you can prove he
didn't do it with his gun.

840
00:58:12,103 --> 00:58:15,033
They know it wasn't Michael's
gun that killed George.

841
00:58:15,106 --> 00:58:18,819
The gun that did kill George can't be
found, Lover, so we can't prove...

842
00:58:18,901 --> 00:58:20,906
that Michael didn't shoot him.

843
00:58:20,987 --> 00:58:24,000
And it was Michael's gun
that killed Broome.

844
00:58:25,491 --> 00:58:26,702
Now...

845
00:58:27,285 --> 00:58:30,748
Michael is going to need
everything that the greatest...

846
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:33,250
living trial lawyer can do for him.

847
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:37,878
Our good district attorney over there
has worked up a beautiful case.

848
00:58:38,087 --> 00:58:41,385
The truck driver, the fat saloon
keeper down at the docks...

849
00:58:41,465 --> 00:58:44,728
they'll be effective witnesses.
He'll know how to handle them.

850
00:58:44,802 --> 00:58:47,270
And then there's this
crazy confession.

851
00:58:47,555 --> 00:58:49,975
But Michael has an explanation.

852
00:58:51,267 --> 00:58:52,477
Explanation?

853
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,529
- You think it's funny?
- Funny?

854
00:58:55,021 --> 00:58:58,651
You mean that story about how George
hired Michael to kill George?

855
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,323
To pretend to kill him.

856
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:01,493
Really?

857
00:59:02,612 --> 00:59:04,830
Why would George want to disappear?

858
00:59:05,364 --> 00:59:08,045
Michael said something about
partnership insurance.

859
00:59:08,117 --> 00:59:10,454
- What?
- Partnership insurance.

860
00:59:10,536 --> 00:59:12,458
- Which George wanted to collect?
- Yes.

861
00:59:12,538 --> 00:59:14,757
George wanted everybody
to think he was dead?

862
00:59:14,832 --> 00:59:15,959
Yes!

863
00:59:17,084 --> 00:59:19,552
Dead, so that he could
collect the insurance?

864
00:59:19,629 --> 00:59:20,839
Yes.

865
00:59:22,465 --> 00:59:25,348
Well, if he was dead,
how could he collect?

866
00:59:25,968 --> 00:59:27,142
Now, Lover...

867
00:59:27,428 --> 00:59:30,441
if your Irishman doesn't want
to go to the gas chamber...

868
00:59:30,514 --> 00:59:32,851
he's going to have to trust me.

869
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:36,024
But you, do you trust him?

870
00:59:37,938 --> 00:59:40,489
I wouldn't trust him with my wife.

871
00:59:42,485 --> 00:59:45,949
You want to make sure he
doesn't get off, don't you?

872
00:59:46,489 --> 00:59:48,909
I've never lost a case, remember?

873
00:59:50,618 --> 00:59:51,959
Besides...

874
01:00:01,295 --> 01:00:03,763
my wife might think
he was a martyr.

875
01:00:05,424 --> 01:00:07,311
I've got to defend him.

876
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:10,140
I haven't any choice.

877
01:00:12,515 --> 01:00:14,401
And neither have you.

878
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:24,778
Hello.

879
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:29,205
It looks bad for me. Isn't
that what your husband says?

880
01:00:29,615 --> 01:00:32,545
Whatever else he is, Arthur's
a marvellous lawyer.

881
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:35,757
- You've got to trust him, Michael.
- Why should I trust him?

882
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:37,799
Because it's your only chance.

883
01:00:40,459 --> 01:00:42,180
Because I want you to.

884
01:00:43,129 --> 01:00:45,216
That'll have to do for a reason.

885
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,139
- Why did you kill Broome?
- What?

886
01:00:49,218 --> 01:00:51,472
Don't be afraid to tell me.
I just want to know.

887
01:00:51,554 --> 01:00:54,982
It was Grisby who killed Broome. He
was going to murder your husband.

888
01:00:55,057 --> 01:00:57,987
George kill Arthur? What could
he possibly gain from it?

889
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,065
- He couldn't get a divorce.
- What?

890
01:01:00,146 --> 01:01:03,740
He wanted people to think he was dead
so he could get away from his wife.

891
01:01:03,816 --> 01:01:06,070
- Wife? But that's impossible.
- Why?

892
01:01:07,528 --> 01:01:09,284
George didn't have a wife.

893
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:12,418
He wasn't married.

894
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:28,050
And because of that, you can be
fairly certain of the month.

895
01:01:29,342 --> 01:01:31,726
Mrs. Bannister,
I saved a seat for you.

896
01:01:32,386 --> 01:01:34,723
Would you gentlemen
please move over?

897
01:01:36,015 --> 01:01:38,435
- Thank you.
- Sit down!

898
01:01:38,517 --> 01:01:40,238
I just want to look at her.

899
01:01:40,311 --> 01:01:45,365
I object! The question calls for the
operation of the officer's mind.

900
01:01:46,317 --> 01:01:47,658
Sustained.

901
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:51,081
Very well. In the interest of
saving time, we'll proceed...

902
01:01:51,155 --> 01:01:54,833
as I'm sure Officer Peters
is most anxious to go home...

903
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:57,874
to his wife and family
before returning to duty.

904
01:01:57,954 --> 01:02:01,548
Now then, Officer Peters, except for
the blood, the clothes were dry.

905
01:02:01,624 --> 01:02:03,177
- Yes, sir.
- They were dry.

906
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:06,798
The defendant stated in his confession
he threw the body into the bay.

907
01:02:06,879 --> 01:02:09,679
Your Honour, the district
attorney isn't cross-examining.

908
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:11,727
- He's making speeches.
- That isn't so!

909
01:02:11,801 --> 01:02:14,137
I move for the declaration
of mistrial...

910
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,770
on the grounds that the
jury is being prejudiced.

911
01:02:16,847 --> 01:02:20,691
These are some of the great Bannister's
trial tactics, in appeal for sympathy.

912
01:02:20,768 --> 01:02:23,272
The district attorney is
beginning to get vicious.

913
01:02:23,354 --> 01:02:27,032
When you two gentlemen get over
your argument, tell me who won.

914
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:29,529
Then I'll decide on the objection.

915
01:02:31,737 --> 01:02:33,125
Objection sustained.

916
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:35,333
Your witness, Mr. Bannister.

917
01:02:35,574 --> 01:02:39,916
No questions, except, yes...

918
01:02:40,913 --> 01:02:46,003
Officer Peters, I don't wish to keep
you from your wife and children...

919
01:02:46,877 --> 01:02:51,682
any more than the district attorney,
who was so concerned about them...

920
01:02:52,675 --> 01:02:55,558
but I would like to
ask you one question:

921
01:02:57,596 --> 01:03:01,025
Officer Peters, have you
a wife and children?

922
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,775
Well...

923
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:05,397
no.

924
01:03:08,232 --> 01:03:10,486
Thank you. You may step down.

925
01:03:10,943 --> 01:03:12,948
Call your next witness.

926
01:03:13,904 --> 01:03:15,660
I call...

927
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:19,665
Arthur Bannister.

928
01:03:23,664 --> 01:03:27,010
It's certainly unusual, Your Honour,
to put a defence attorney...

929
01:03:27,084 --> 01:03:28,757
on the witness stand.

930
01:03:28,836 --> 01:03:32,597
But I'm confident that my
client will make no objection.

931
01:03:33,007 --> 01:03:36,353
Galloway can't make Bannister testify
against his own client, right?

932
01:03:36,427 --> 01:03:39,108
This trial keeps getting
screwier all the time!

933
01:03:39,722 --> 01:03:41,941
Your Honour, I wouldn't
take this step...

934
01:03:42,016 --> 01:03:46,358
if there were more effective means of
establishing the evidence I'll bring forward.

935
01:03:46,437 --> 01:03:49,023
With my client's
express permission...

936
01:03:50,232 --> 01:03:52,736
Mr. Bannister will take the stand.

937
01:03:53,778 --> 01:03:55,949
I've never seen anything
like that before.

938
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:58,498
- I thought he was smart.
- They don't come smarter.

939
01:03:58,574 --> 01:04:00,579
- Maybe he's the bad guy?
- Maybe he's wrong?

940
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,878
- Maybe he killed him?
- You ain't kidding!

941
01:04:02,954 --> 01:04:06,216
Do you solemnly swear to tell the
whole truth, so help you God?

942
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:07,715
I do.

943
01:04:07,792 --> 01:04:09,133
State your name.

944
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:10,930
Arthur Bannister.

945
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:19,346
Mr. Bannister, you are
a member of the Bar.

946
01:04:20,262 --> 01:04:21,686
I am.

947
01:04:22,431 --> 01:04:23,689
Quiet!

948
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:26,106
And have been...

949
01:04:26,394 --> 01:04:27,687
Quiet!

950
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:30,274
And have been for a
number of years.

951
01:04:30,564 --> 01:04:32,237
That is correct.

952
01:04:34,902 --> 01:04:38,959
The defendant, Michael O'Hara, worked
as a crew member on your yacht.

953
01:04:39,699 --> 01:04:41,122
Yes.

954
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,751
Did he seem happy in his job?

955
01:04:43,869 --> 01:04:45,376
I beg your pardon?

956
01:04:45,746 --> 01:04:48,760
- You had your back turned...
- Did he seem happy in his job?

957
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,386
Reasonably so.

958
01:04:50,543 --> 01:04:52,346
- Did you get that answer?
- I did.

959
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,713
Reasonably so.

960
01:04:53,796 --> 01:04:56,513
As a matter of fact, wasn't
he threatening to quit?

961
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:57,718
Yes.

962
01:04:58,175 --> 01:05:01,639
Did you know, Mr. Bannister,
that right after the murders...

963
01:05:02,888 --> 01:05:06,732
Right after the murders, we found
the defendant's bags packed...

964
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:10,107
and everything put away in readiness
for an immediate departure?

965
01:05:10,187 --> 01:05:11,279
Yes.

966
01:05:11,355 --> 01:05:15,235
In your experience as an attorney,
would this not indicate premeditation?

967
01:05:15,318 --> 01:05:17,287
The district attorney
is making speeches...

968
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:21,074
- Premeditation and plan for flight?
- Making speeches, drawing conclusions!

969
01:05:21,157 --> 01:05:23,126
- I'm not drawing conclusions!
- You are!

970
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,244
Gentlemen!

971
01:05:24,327 --> 01:05:27,589
- He is asking improper questions...
- Your Honour, I think...

972
01:05:27,663 --> 01:05:31,009
I ask Your Honour to
declare a mistrial.

973
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,513
Overruled.

974
01:05:33,044 --> 01:05:34,431
Exception.

975
01:05:34,795 --> 01:05:36,682
No further questions.

976
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:39,852
Would Your Honour kindly
explain to the jury that...

977
01:05:39,925 --> 01:05:43,936
since the district attorney has placed
me in the position of a witness...

978
01:05:44,013 --> 01:05:48,853
I am permitted, as the defence
attorney, to cross-examine myself?

979
01:05:50,061 --> 01:05:54,402
These are more of the persuasive
Mr. Bannister's trial tactics.

980
01:05:54,482 --> 01:05:57,614
The jury is so instructed.

981
01:05:59,779 --> 01:06:02,365
Question: Mr. Bannister, did
the defendant say anything...

982
01:06:02,448 --> 01:06:04,667
as to why he had taken the job?

983
01:06:04,825 --> 01:06:07,246
Answer: Yes, Mr. Bannister.

984
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,548
He reminded Mr. Bannister
that Mr. Bannister...

985
01:06:11,624 --> 01:06:16,263
had to go to the seaman's hiring
hall and use his persuasive powers...

986
01:06:16,963 --> 01:06:19,299
to convince the defendant
to take the job.

987
01:06:19,382 --> 01:06:20,425
Question:

988
01:06:20,549 --> 01:06:22,804
Can you think of anything else,
Mr. Bannister...

989
01:06:22,885 --> 01:06:24,890
that is relevant to this inquiry?

990
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:29,811
I found this boy to be clean
cut, courageous, resourceful...

991
01:06:30,142 --> 01:06:31,815
honest, hardworking.

992
01:06:31,894 --> 01:06:35,987
Question: Now, Mr. Bannister, please
answer the question, yes or no.

993
01:06:36,107 --> 01:06:40,117
Can you think of anything else
that is relevant to this issue?

994
01:06:40,403 --> 01:06:41,446
Answer:

995
01:06:41,612 --> 01:06:42,704
No!

996
01:06:44,991 --> 01:06:48,454
Very well. Thank you, Mr. Bannister.
You may step down.

997
01:06:51,205 --> 01:06:55,962
Your Honour, I have a subpoena for a
witness who is present in the courtroom.

998
01:06:56,252 --> 01:06:58,956
May I have the bailiff
serve it at this time?

999
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:01,450
Bailiff, you will
serve the subpoena.

1000
01:07:07,805 --> 01:07:10,309
I call Mrs. Arthur Bannister.

1001
01:07:12,351 --> 01:07:14,273
She doesn't have to, does she?

1002
01:07:14,353 --> 01:07:15,445
I don't know.

1003
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:17,687
Don't be silly. Sure,
she's got to take it.

1004
01:07:17,713 --> 01:07:19,140
Well, who says there is?

1005
01:07:19,317 --> 01:07:21,902
Sit down and mind
your own business.

1006
01:07:32,747 --> 01:07:34,384
Raise your right hand.

1007
01:07:34,457 --> 01:07:38,846
Do you solemnly swear to tell the
whole truth, so help you God?

1008
01:07:38,919 --> 01:07:40,094
I do.

1009
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:43,136
- State your name.
- Mrs. Arthur Bannister.

1010
01:07:45,009 --> 01:07:48,805
Mrs. Bannister, did you
ever have guards...

1011
01:07:48,888 --> 01:07:53,230
to police your house, or the yacht
on which you just made a cruise?

1012
01:07:53,684 --> 01:07:54,776
No.

1013
01:07:54,935 --> 01:07:56,063
Why?

1014
01:07:57,104 --> 01:07:59,109
We never felt the need of it.

1015
01:07:59,523 --> 01:08:01,860
You have no children, have you?

1016
01:08:03,152 --> 01:08:05,406
- I have no children.
- You have no children.

1017
01:08:05,488 --> 01:08:09,284
So you weren't concerned about
kidnappers, is that correct?

1018
01:08:09,909 --> 01:08:11,499
That is correct.

1019
01:08:11,577 --> 01:08:13,796
There was a man employed
in your house...

1020
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:17,584
and on your husband's yacht
named Sidney Broome?

1021
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:19,675
Yes.

1022
01:08:19,752 --> 01:08:22,302
You've known Mr. Broome
for several years?

1023
01:08:22,672 --> 01:08:23,763
No.

1024
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:27,897
Would it surprise you if I were
to tell you that the detective...

1025
01:08:28,469 --> 01:08:33,393
hired by your husband in divorce
cases was Sidney Broome?

1026
01:08:33,808 --> 01:08:36,738
The man who was employed
in your house as a butler...

1027
01:08:36,811 --> 01:08:40,275
and on your yacht as a steward,
and who was subsequently murdered.

1028
01:08:40,356 --> 01:08:42,657
- I object!
- Does the counsel deny that...

1029
01:08:42,984 --> 01:08:44,194
Overruled.

1030
01:08:44,277 --> 01:08:47,740
Does counsel deny that the butler
Broome was the detective Broome...

1031
01:08:47,822 --> 01:08:50,041
used by him in divorce cases?

1032
01:08:50,241 --> 01:08:55,046
Mrs. Bannister, can you think of any
reason why your husband would want...

1033
01:08:55,121 --> 01:08:58,300
to hire a divorce detective
other than to watch you?

1034
01:08:58,374 --> 01:09:00,759
- I object!
- Objection sustained.

1035
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:03,297
Didn't you and your husband...

1036
01:09:03,379 --> 01:09:06,725
have an argument about your
showing an infatuation for O'Hara?

1037
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:07,973
We did not.

1038
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:11,930
Isn't it a fact that the defendant,
O'Hara, made advances to you?

1039
01:09:12,013 --> 01:09:15,026
And told you he was
infatuated with you?

1040
01:09:18,644 --> 01:09:20,649
He was very respectful.

1041
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,985
Speak up, Mrs. Bannister.

1042
01:09:25,234 --> 01:09:27,239
He was very respectful.

1043
01:09:28,487 --> 01:09:31,584
And I think he was fond of me.

1044
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:35,460
Just what is your definition
of "fond," Mrs. Bannister?

1045
01:09:37,204 --> 01:09:39,625
As a matter of fact,
you and Michael O'Hara...

1046
01:09:39,707 --> 01:09:41,759
have kissed each
other, haven't you?

1047
01:09:41,834 --> 01:09:45,132
To name one occasion, you were seen
in the aquarium of this city...

1048
01:09:45,212 --> 01:09:47,099
kissing each other!

1049
01:09:47,173 --> 01:09:48,893
Do you deny that?

1050
01:09:56,974 --> 01:09:58,148
No.

1051
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:03,951
No further questions.
Your witness, Mr. Bannister.

1052
01:10:07,401 --> 01:10:08,908
No questions.

1053
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:14,826
The State Department has
refused any comment.

1054
01:10:14,909 --> 01:10:17,839
Here in San Francisco, the fate
of "Black Irish" O'Hara...

1055
01:10:17,912 --> 01:10:21,009
notorious waterfront agitator,
whose trial for murder...

1056
01:10:21,082 --> 01:10:23,668
has held the front pages
these recent weeks...

1057
01:10:23,751 --> 01:10:26,966
remains undecided, as the
jury, already out seven hours...

1058
01:10:27,046 --> 01:10:31,305
has still to return a verdict.
The "Black Irish" case, according to...

1059
01:10:57,118 --> 01:11:00,416
- How long do they take usually?
- You can't ever tell about a jury.

1060
01:11:07,044 --> 01:11:08,681
Excuse me, Your Honour.

1061
01:11:08,879 --> 01:11:10,054
Yes?

1062
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:11,721
The jury's coming out now.

1063
01:11:11,799 --> 01:11:13,934
Thank you, Officer McNulty.

1064
01:11:26,188 --> 01:11:27,576
By the way...

1065
01:11:30,651 --> 01:11:32,656
what has Elsa been telling you?

1066
01:11:32,737 --> 01:11:36,617
Did you imagine that I didn't know
she's been coming to see you?

1067
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:39,708
- She asked me to trust you.
- But you don't.

1068
01:11:39,785 --> 01:11:41,541
The jury's reached its verdict.

1069
01:11:41,621 --> 01:11:42,664
Why?

1070
01:11:43,164 --> 01:11:45,928
Because I know you wanted
me to be convicted.

1071
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,883
Now that it's too late for you
to do anything about it...

1072
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:52,805
I might as well tell you, this
is one case I've enjoyed losing.

1073
01:11:53,966 --> 01:11:57,727
I'm coming to see you in the
death house, Michael. Every day.

1074
01:11:58,387 --> 01:12:01,021
Our little visits
will be great fun.

1075
01:12:01,432 --> 01:12:05,904
I'm going to ask for a stay of execution.
And I really hope it will be granted.

1076
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,653
I want you to live as long
as possible before you die.

1077
01:12:09,732 --> 01:12:12,580
You're talking kind of tough,
aren't you, Mr. Bannister?

1078
01:12:12,652 --> 01:12:16,413
I've got an edge. I know you're
going to the gas chamber.

1079
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:19,162
Don't be so sure.

1080
01:12:19,575 --> 01:12:21,414
I know the killer.

1081
01:12:22,828 --> 01:12:24,999
I know who murdered Grisby.

1082
01:12:26,582 --> 01:12:27,970
Michael!

1083
01:12:35,967 --> 01:12:39,265
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you arrived at a verdict?

1084
01:12:39,345 --> 01:12:40,768
We, the jury, have...

1085
01:12:40,846 --> 01:12:42,768
Wait a minute!

1086
01:12:42,848 --> 01:12:45,103
He took poisoned pills!

1087
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:47,404
Take him to my chambers!

1088
01:12:52,483 --> 01:12:54,619
I just talked to the doctor.
He's coming.

1089
01:12:54,694 --> 01:12:55,904
Keep him on his feet.

1090
01:12:55,987 --> 01:12:58,751
- We need help.
- I can't control this crowd by myself.

1091
01:12:58,823 --> 01:13:02,204
The way I understand it, he'll be
all right if we keep him moving.

1092
01:13:02,285 --> 01:13:03,625
I need help in there!

1093
01:13:03,703 --> 01:13:06,289
- If he goes to sleep, he's done for.
- Done for?

1094
01:13:06,372 --> 01:13:10,085
I need at least two of your officers
to control the crowd in my courtroom.

1095
01:13:10,167 --> 01:13:11,721
I'll try and get the reporters.

1096
01:13:11,794 --> 01:13:14,891
Reporters? You'll do no such thing.

1097
01:13:14,964 --> 01:13:17,099
- Come in.
- I'll see the reporters right now!

1098
01:13:17,174 --> 01:13:20,887
We have to prepare a statement.
That's it, Manny, keep him walking!

1099
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:22,892
All right, Mr. Galloway.

1100
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,962
No pictures, please, now!

1101
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:25,336
Stay close together now,
while I escort you out to dinner.

1102
01:14:25,409 --> 01:14:26,999
- Sure, it's Mike.
- What can we do?

1103
01:14:27,078 --> 01:14:28,750
We've got to think of something.

1104
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:31,463
That's another jury
from another trial.

1105
01:14:31,582 --> 01:14:33,385
Please do not talk
about the case...

1106
01:14:33,459 --> 01:14:37,137
outside of the jury room. The judge
hopes that you will arrive at...

1107
01:14:37,213 --> 01:14:39,597
a verdict as soon as possible.

1108
01:14:43,219 --> 01:14:45,438
That way! Come on. There he goes!

1109
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:47,520
My goodness, my window!

1110
01:14:47,598 --> 01:14:50,944
My chessboard! McNulty! Officer!

1111
01:14:51,394 --> 01:14:53,529
I expect a full report from you.

1112
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:56,155
Get off the floor, Officer!
No pictures!

1113
01:14:56,232 --> 01:14:57,655
- What happened?
- Hello?

1114
01:14:57,733 --> 01:15:01,245
That woman's too nice looking to
have stolen all that jewellery.

1115
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,749
Jury duty is such a responsibility,
don't you think?

1116
01:15:05,324 --> 01:15:07,329
You were told not to
talk about the case.

1117
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:10,459
Now don't let it happen again.
All right, keep moving!

1118
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:57,513
That way!

1119
01:16:32,995 --> 01:16:34,965
Did you see a man come by?

1120
01:16:35,247 --> 01:16:37,217
She's looking for someone.

1121
01:16:40,044 --> 01:16:41,716
- One?
- Yes.

1122
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,054
Where is the Westerner sitting?

1123
01:17:02,066 --> 01:17:04,570
- Where is the phone?
- Backstage.

1124
01:17:31,262 --> 01:17:33,516
- Where?
- Over there.

1125
01:17:36,767 --> 01:17:40,113
- Please connect to Li Gong.
- Where is Li Gong?

1126
01:17:50,656 --> 01:17:54,085
- Hello, Li?
- Hello. This is Li Gong.

1127
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:56,379
Please help me.

1128
01:17:56,454 --> 01:17:59,218
I will send someone
over to help you.

1129
01:18:21,854 --> 01:18:25,283
- Why did you do it, Michael?
- I didn't. I'm not guilty.

1130
01:18:25,816 --> 01:18:28,534
You mean the pills?

1131
01:18:29,111 --> 01:18:32,208
I saw you begging me with
your eyes to swallow them.

1132
01:18:32,281 --> 01:18:36,243
You didn't mean for me to take them all.
So I held some back, but not enough.

1133
01:18:36,327 --> 01:18:39,542
I took too many of
the pills. I'm faint.

1134
01:18:39,622 --> 01:18:41,129
And now what?

1135
01:18:41,499 --> 01:18:44,512
- I got to find something...
- Don't you know they'll catch you?

1136
01:18:44,585 --> 01:18:46,590
- Where will you hide?
- I must find that gun.

1137
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:49,007
Gun? What gun?

1138
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:53,052
I've got to find the gun that killed
Grisby. It'll prove I'm innocent.

1139
01:18:54,178 --> 01:18:56,978
I've phoned our servant, Li.

1140
01:18:57,139 --> 01:19:00,153
We're trying to arrange something,
some place to take you.

1141
01:19:00,226 --> 01:19:03,358
Just wait here quietly
and watch the play.

1142
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:16,623
The police.

1143
01:19:21,247 --> 01:19:22,967
Put your arms around me.

1144
01:19:50,568 --> 01:19:51,991
Don't move!

1145
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:03,716
Don't you move! I told you
not to move, I mean it.

1146
01:20:05,082 --> 01:20:06,755
I found the gun.

1147
01:20:07,001 --> 01:20:08,840
You killed Grisby. Yes.

1148
01:20:10,504 --> 01:20:12,889
You're the killer.

1149
01:20:18,054 --> 01:20:19,691
Go out there.

1150
01:20:28,731 --> 01:20:32,954
I was right. She was the killer.
She killed Grisby.

1151
01:20:33,444 --> 01:20:35,366
Now she was going to kill me.

1152
01:20:35,446 --> 01:20:37,996
Li and his friends smuggled
me out in the dark...

1153
01:20:38,074 --> 01:20:41,870
and hid me where I'd be safe
from the cops, not safe from her.

1154
01:20:41,953 --> 01:20:44,337
One of the Chinese worked
in an amusement park.

1155
01:20:44,413 --> 01:20:46,134
It was closed for the season.

1156
01:20:46,207 --> 01:20:48,710
An empty amusement park
makes a good hideout...

1157
01:20:48,793 --> 01:20:51,047
and she wanted me hidden.

1158
01:20:53,506 --> 01:20:56,187
Well, I came to...

1159
01:20:58,344 --> 01:21:00,314
in the Crazy House.

1160
01:21:00,471 --> 01:21:05,442
And for a while there, I thought
it was me that was crazy.

1161
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:11,066
After what I'd been through, anything
crazy at all seemed natural.

1162
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:15,782
But now, I was sane
on one subject: her.

1163
01:21:16,237 --> 01:21:17,625
I knew about her.

1164
01:21:17,863 --> 01:21:21,826
She'd planned to kill Bannister,
she and Grisby.

1165
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:25,542
Grisby was to do it for a
share of Bannister's money.

1166
01:21:25,705 --> 01:21:27,377
That's what Grisby thought.

1167
01:21:27,456 --> 01:21:31,336
Of course, she meant to kill Grisby,
too, after he'd served his purpose.

1168
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:34,053
Poor howling idiot.
He never even did that.

1169
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:37,926
He went and shot Broome and
that was not part of the plan.

1170
01:21:38,301 --> 01:21:41,266
Broome might have got to
the police before he died.

1171
01:21:41,345 --> 01:21:46,020
And if the cops traced it to Grisby,
and the cops made Grisby talk...

1172
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:49,279
he'd spill everything,
and she'd be finished.

1173
01:21:49,395 --> 01:21:52,658
She had to shut up
Grisby, but quick...

1174
01:21:53,316 --> 01:21:55,118
and I was the fall guy.

1175
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,614
In here. We're less
likely to be heard.

1176
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:36,323
I thought it was only your
husband you wanted to kill.

1177
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,820
Why don't you try to understand?

1178
01:22:39,195 --> 01:22:41,496
George was supposed
to take care of Arthur...

1179
01:22:41,572 --> 01:22:44,704
but he lost his silly
head and shot Broome.

1180
01:22:46,202 --> 01:22:49,001
After that, I knew
I couldn't trust him.

1181
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:51,254
He was mad.

1182
01:22:51,916 --> 01:22:53,423
He had to be shot.

1183
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:56,799
- And what about me?
- We could have gone off together.

1184
01:22:56,879 --> 01:22:58,635
Into the sunrise?

1185
01:22:59,757 --> 01:23:02,261
You and me? Or you and Grisby?

1186
01:23:02,343 --> 01:23:03,731
I love you.

1187
01:23:03,803 --> 01:23:08,311
"One who follows his nature keeps
his original nature in the end."

1188
01:23:09,809 --> 01:23:13,570
But haven't you heard ever
of something better to follow?

1189
01:23:16,983 --> 01:23:18,110
No.

1190
01:23:23,739 --> 01:23:25,827
I knew I'd find you two together.

1191
01:23:25,908 --> 01:23:29,870
If I hadn't, Elsa, I might have
gone on playing it your way.

1192
01:23:30,121 --> 01:23:33,086
You didn't know that, but you
did plan for me to follow you.

1193
01:23:33,165 --> 01:23:34,719
You've been drinking.

1194
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:38,174
I presume you think that
if you murder me here...

1195
01:23:38,254 --> 01:23:42,928
your sailor friend will get the blame,
and you'll be free to spend my money.

1196
01:23:43,301 --> 01:23:46,848
Well, dear, you aren't the
only one who wants me to die.

1197
01:23:46,929 --> 01:23:49,100
Our good friend, the
district attorney...

1198
01:23:49,181 --> 01:23:52,479
is just itching to open a
letter that I left with him.

1199
01:23:53,019 --> 01:23:56,067
The letter tells all
about you, Lover...

1200
01:23:56,689 --> 01:23:59,952
so you'd be foolish
to fire that gun.

1201
01:24:01,485 --> 01:24:06,456
With these mirrors, it's difficult to
tell. You are aiming at me, aren't you?

1202
01:24:06,866 --> 01:24:08,918
I'm aiming at you, Lover!

1203
01:24:09,535 --> 01:24:12,335
Of course, killing you
is killing myself.

1204
01:24:13,205 --> 01:24:15,008
It's the same thing.

1205
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:19,389
But, you know, I'm pretty
tired of both of us.

1206
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:46,538
You know, for a smart girl,
you make a lot of mistakes.

1207
01:24:46,864 --> 01:24:49,118
You should have let me live.

1208
01:24:49,825 --> 01:24:52,411
You're going to need a good lawyer.

1209
01:24:59,377 --> 01:25:02,141
He and George...

1210
01:25:06,133 --> 01:25:07,770
and now me.

1211
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:11,267
Like the sharks, mad
with their own blood...

1212
01:25:12,264 --> 01:25:14,898
chewing away at their own selves.

1213
01:25:16,352 --> 01:25:17,775
It's true.

1214
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:23,117
I made a lot of mistakes.

1215
01:25:24,026 --> 01:25:27,289
You said the world's bad. We can't
run away from the badness...

1216
01:25:27,363 --> 01:25:30,328
and you're right there.
But you said we can't fight it.

1217
01:25:30,408 --> 01:25:33,338
We must deal with the
badness, make terms.

1218
01:25:33,703 --> 01:25:36,087
And didn't the badness
deal with you...

1219
01:25:36,163 --> 01:25:39,129
and make its own terms
in the end, surely?

1220
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:42,133
You can fight, but what good is it?

1221
01:25:45,506 --> 01:25:46,799
Goodbye.

1222
01:25:46,966 --> 01:25:51,058
- Do you mean we can't win?
- No, we can't win.

1223
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:55,066
Give my love to the sunrise.

1224
01:25:55,641 --> 01:25:59,402
We can't lose either,
only if we quit.

1225
01:26:00,062 --> 01:26:02,114
And you're not going to?

1226
01:26:02,315 --> 01:26:03,702
Not again.

1227
01:26:08,904 --> 01:26:10,376
I'm afraid.

1228
01:26:13,576 --> 01:26:17,337
Michael, come back here!

1229
01:26:18,623 --> 01:26:21,802
Michael, please!

1230
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:24,597
I don't want to die!

1231
01:26:26,213 --> 01:26:29,013
I don't want to die!

1232
01:26:35,097 --> 01:26:38,728
I went to call the cops but
I knew she'd be dead...

1233
01:26:38,809 --> 01:26:40,565
before they got there.

1234
01:26:40,645 --> 01:26:42,116
And I'd be free.

1235
01:26:42,188 --> 01:26:45,071
Bannister's note to
the DA would fix it.

1236
01:26:45,191 --> 01:26:47,160
I'd be innocent officially.

1237
01:26:47,234 --> 01:26:51,197
But that's a big word, "innocent."
"Stupid" is more like it.

1238
01:26:54,116 --> 01:26:56,834
Everybody is somebody's fool.

1239
01:26:57,495 --> 01:27:00,045
The only way to stay out of
trouble is to grow old...

1240
01:27:00,122 --> 01:27:02,708
so I guess I'll
concentrate on that.

1241
01:27:02,792 --> 01:27:07,015
Maybe I'll live so long
that I'll forget her.

1242
01:27:08,589 --> 01:27:10,843
Maybe I'll die trying.

1242
01:27:11,305 --> 01:28:11,231

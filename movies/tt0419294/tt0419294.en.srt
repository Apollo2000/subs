2
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:24,518
There's some coyotes hopping around
across the road from that windmill.

3
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:26,321
What are they doing?

4
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,288
Hell, l don't know.

5
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:33,085
Looks like they're eating
something, l guess.

6
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,823
Wanna shoot a coyote?

7
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,326
Hell, yes.

8
00:02:58,098 --> 00:02:59,961
That's a dead son of a bitch.

9
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:13,630
Fuck.

10
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:19,487
- When did they find him?
- Sometime this morning.

11
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:21,927
He was buried on a hill
near Boracho Peak.

12
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,997
- Who killed him?
- No fucking clue.

13
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,427
Was he involved with drugs
or smuggling or anything like that?

14
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,224
Melquiades Estrada?

15
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:32,364
No.

16
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:34,661
l gotta get a mask.

17
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,355
Jo Edna, let Earl tend to the
hot dogs and the hamburgers.

18
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:53,500
He'll bring the charcoal and ice...

19
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,155
...and folding chairs
and the whole nine yards.

20
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,060
Just be sure Minnie
don't have to worry...

21
00:03:58,233 --> 00:04:00,461
...about a place to go
to the little girls' room.

22
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:04,089
And tell Shawnelle she can forget
about a car on Saturday night...

23
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:06,029
...if she don't show up.

24
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:08,860
l love you too, baby. Gotta go.

25
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,862
This beauty has two bedrooms,
each one with its own bathroom.

26
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:15,932
Central AC and heat throughout.

27
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:19,659
All of our homes come standard
equipped with electric oven...

28
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:22,096
...washer, drier and dishwasher.

29
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:25,768
Your Waste King garbage
disposal is optional, of course.

30
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:29,390
lt's a good option because
we charge the wholesale price on it...

31
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,399
...with no installation fee,
and it's top of the line.

32
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,164
We're strictly top of the line.

33
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:42,597
Strictly top of the line
all the time. That's our motto.

34
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:47,467
- How much this house cost?
- Sixty thousand dollars.

35
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:49,898
But if you're really interested...

36
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,833
...l can get you a
10 percent discount, l think.

37
00:04:57,904 --> 00:04:59,096
Where y'all from?

38
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,759
Cincinnati.

39
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,500
Long way from home, huh?

40
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,802
- What line of work bring you to Texas?
- Border Patrolman.

41
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,536
We're always
a long way from home.

42
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:14,967
Yeah. All right.

43
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:18,763
Well, actually, this mobile
residence has the highest...

44
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:22,335
...resale value of any domestic
residence in its price range...

45
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:26,231
...in the Southwest
time and time again.

46
00:05:28,138 --> 00:05:29,229
l don't know.

47
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:33,633
Well, we also have some excellent
previously owned mobile residences...

48
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:38,636
...in the lower price ranges
if that would be your requirement.

49
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,237
Come over here, Sparky.

50
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:06,071
lt's a good thing
you can do something else.

51
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,200
l think my horse needs water.

52
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:19,038
Where'd you come from?

53
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:22,838
Coahuila.

54
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:25,164
What are you doing in Texas?

55
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:28,572
Looking for work.

56
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:30,900
What kind of work?

57
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:39,738
l'm just a cowboy.

58
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,268
Hey, Perkins.

59
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,168
Here's the stuff that your
friend had on him.

60
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,570
- You know who they are?
- That's his wife and kids.

61
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:03,073
- Any idea how to get ahold of them?
- Well, they live in...

62
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:06,609
...Mexico.

63
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:13,041
Can l keep this?

64
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:17,170
Yeah, l guess for a while. We're
gonna have to do an autopsy on him.

65
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:20,935
When you get through,
l want you to give Melquiades to me.

66
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:23,441
- Hell, l can't do that. Are you crazy?
- No.

67
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:27,973
l'm not.

68
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:38,569
Gotta go.

69
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:47,405
- All right, see you tonight.
- Come back early, though.

70
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,568
l get real bored here.

71
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:52,211
Haven't you made
friends with the neighbors?

72
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:55,968
No, l don't like them.

73
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,972
l'm gonna buy you Nintendo
so you don't get so bored.

74
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:03,436
Okay.

75
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:06,636
And take me to the mall
this Saturday in Odessa.

76
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:09,677
Okay, babe. Find out where it is.

77
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:17,971
The deceased died of a gunshot
wound of an AR-15.223 bullet.

78
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:21,579
Entered 2 inches left of the sternum
between the fourth and fifth rib.

79
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:23,213
lmpact caused a lung to burst.

80
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:25,973
Severe hemorrhaging.
Took 15, 20 minutes to die.

81
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:28,272
l would estimate
he died seven days ago.

82
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:32,380
The trajectory indicates that the shot
was fired from 300 yards away.

83
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:33,775
He was gunned down.

84
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,009
Listen, bud, we need
to bury him now.

85
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:41,409
Refrigeration in this dump is broke,
and l gotta be in El Paso tomorrow.

86
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:44,979
- Okay, bury him.
- l need to notify his relatives.

87
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:48,375
He ain't got any.

88
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:52,872
<i>Two-one-seven, clear.</i>

89
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:03,872
<i>Three-five-nine, clear.</i>

90
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:17,574
<i>This is 749.</i>

91
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,546
<i>I have approximately 15 individuals
crossing La Brecha de la Loma Negra.</i>

92
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:24,740
<i>About a half a mile from me. Over.</i>

93
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,382
Where are they?

94
00:09:48,952 --> 00:09:51,111
Right down there in that draw.

95
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:58,174
On the ground!

96
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:03,442
Get down!

97
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:04,982
<i>Alto, goddamn it!</i>

98
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:14,916
Run, run, Mariana!

99
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:20,444
Take her.

100
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:03,144
Stay down, bitch!

101
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:14,349
Stay down.

102
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:24,150
- How many got away?
- Three.

103
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:26,881
Well, somebody's gotta
pick strawberries.

104
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:31,214
You were way overboard there, boy.

105
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,385
No, sir.

106
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:36,846
Fuck it. They were
trying to get away.

107
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:41,648
Think about how much trouble l'll get
into if you keep beating these people.

108
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:43,518
l don't like trouble, boy.

109
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:45,823
l don't like it at all.

110
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,891
l'm awful sorry about Mel.

111
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,481
So am l.

112
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:27,822
He's a good Mexican.

113
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:35,625
Pete, you been cooped up
in here for two days.

114
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,717
You need to get outside
and do something.

115
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:41,950
What's that to you?

116
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:54,127
Brought you some jerky.

117
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:00,457
l found these shells...

118
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:04,321
...out there where Mel's
goats was on the loose.

119
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:07,859
They was about
300 yards up the hill.

120
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,621
They might mean something.

121
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:01,027
You ladies fine?

122
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:09,557
How's your eggs, sweetie?

123
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:37,793
Bob's watching us.

124
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:43,156
lt's been a while since
we've had some time together.

125
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:46,490
You dirty bitch.

126
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,492
l could see you tomorrow.

127
00:14:54,135 --> 00:14:56,726
- Miss.
- Just a second.

128
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:01,363
Same place?

129
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,660
Same place.

130
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:14,761
What's it gonna be?

131
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,760
- What do you want?
- l wanna talk to you.

132
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:32,100
We found that stuff where
we found Melquiades' goats.

133
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,559
Don't you wanna look at it?

134
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,002
No, l don't. l wanna sit here
and have my breakfast.

135
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,995
- Talk to me during business hours.
- lt might be some kind of proof.

136
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,727
Hey, how many.223 shells
you think are laying out there?

137
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:53,492
Hell, some of them gonna
have your fingerprints on them.

138
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,932
That shit won't mean shit in court just
because you found it under a bush.

139
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:01,598
l got a legal system
to think about here.

140
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,296
You goddamn son of a bitch!

141
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:20,538
<i>Bass seek cover from whatever
the local environment offers.</i>

142
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:21,898
<i>Submerged rock...</i>

143
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:24,970
<i>You've been late for dinner
the last four nights.</i>

144
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:31,561
<i>Work. Work is hard.
Real hard. I work hard.</i>

145
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:34,872
<i>And I'm tired. I'm so tired.</i>

146
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,505
<i>Please, understand.
My boss is not an...</i>

147
00:16:37,673 --> 00:16:39,138
Lou Ann, what's for dinner?

148
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:41,936
Stuffed zucchini and broccoli.

149
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:44,903
- That's it?
- l'm on a diet.

150
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:50,236
<i>Someone else paying the bills?
Putting a roof over your head?</i>

151
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:53,134
<i>Johnny, I know there's
someone else. I know it.</i>

152
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:55,865
<i>- That's ridiculous.
- You're not fat.</i>

153
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,564
<i>- It's that girl from the office. Sheila?
- Yes, l am. A little bit.</i>

154
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:02,206
<i>- No way.
- I saw you together--</i>

155
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:05,100
<i>- You're my red-hot mama.
- She's pretty.</i>

156
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,570
<i>She's prettier than me. She's free
and happy and has red hair.</i>

157
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:11,367
<i>- Stop it.
- I'm not stupid, Johnny. I've got eyes.</i>

158
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:15,132
<i>She'll wreck your life and mine
and hers. That's what will happen.</i>

159
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:17,740
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

160
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:22,340
<i>You're throwing your life away,
Johnny. Don't do it. Please don't do it.</i>

161
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:27,039
<i>I need you. I love you. Please.</i>

162
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:30,971
<i>You see, right there. That's
exactly what I'm talking about.</i>

163
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:34,233
<i>It's always the same.
Always the same.</i>

164
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:36,572
<i>Oh, Johnny.</i>

165
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,539
<i>What's happening to us?</i>

166
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,198
<i>We used to be so happy.</i>

167
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:46,437
<i>Don't you remember when
we were living in River Valley?</i>

168
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,171
<i>Yes, doll.</i>

169
00:17:51,343 --> 00:17:54,105
<i>I remember River Valley.
We were happy then.</i>

170
00:17:54,977 --> 00:17:56,533
<i>And we'll be happy again.</i>

171
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,176
<i>I know it.</i>

172
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,400
<i>Please, don't cry.</i>

173
00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:04,566
<i>There will always be
a River Valley for us.</i>

174
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:06,573
<i>I hope so, Johnny.</i>

175
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:08,736
<i>I hope so.</i>

176
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,245
Thanks.

177
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:41,741
You're getting to be a regular
customer around here.

178
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:45,140
Well, l don't have
a lot to do right now.

179
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:25,012
Let's go. Come on.
Bring them. Bring them.

180
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,272
Got them, now. She's good.

181
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:40,341
- How many calves left?
-120.

182
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:41,981
That's a shitload.

183
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,879
When's the boss
coming from Houston?

184
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,515
Saturday afternoon.

185
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:47,148
Fucking mama's boy.

186
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:49,881
He says he's a rancher just because
they bought him this ranch...

187
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:51,845
...but l ain't seen him out here
busting his ass.

188
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:54,345
You're in a twist because
the only woman you've had...

189
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:56,641
...for a while is your own hand.

190
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,713
Let's go to Midland this Saturday.

191
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,878
The Border Patrol will nab me
in Midland.

192
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:10,847
Bullshit.
You scared of women, or what?

193
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:14,774
Agustin, shut the goddamn gate!

194
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,643
Don't worry.

195
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:22,749
This happens to Bob
sometimes too.

196
00:20:24,218 --> 00:20:26,616
Well, it goddamn well
don't happen to me.

197
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:29,649
lt's the first fucking time
it's ever happened to me.

198
00:20:29,818 --> 00:20:31,943
l don't give a shit
what happens to Bob.

199
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,948
Yeah, l know.

200
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:39,174
Viagra works for Bob.

201
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:43,842
l'll turn truck-stop queer and
blowjob-giver before l use that shit.

202
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,678
That's what Bob says.

203
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,152
Fuck Bob.

204
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,577
<i>Hey, man, you still listen to that
pinche white-boy candy rapper?</i>

205
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:16,618
Reese's Pieces, Skittles, Eminem.
Gotta stop listening to that.

206
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:20,276
Kumbia Kings. That's who you
need to listen to, man.

207
00:21:24,087 --> 00:21:26,451
- What's your favorite rifle round?
- What?

208
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:29,087
What rifle do you shoot?
Always the same round?

209
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,414
AR-15,.223 standard. Why?

210
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:35,146
l was just curious.
l always use the.30-30 myself.

211
00:21:39,055 --> 00:21:40,884
Lever action.

212
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:44,147
Open sight.

213
00:21:49,323 --> 00:21:53,449
- Don't know what you're missing.
- Eminem. That's all he listens to.

214
00:23:53,062 --> 00:23:54,687
Hello.

215
00:24:19,562 --> 00:24:21,892
Shit. Fuck.

216
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,323
Fuck.

217
00:25:23,466 --> 00:25:25,489
How do we register him?

218
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:27,898
Write down ''Melquiades.''

219
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:32,959
Melquiades what?

220
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:34,993
Where's he from?

221
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,623
Mexico. Maybe Coahuila.

222
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:57,129
Cincinnati"s real pretty
in the springtime.

223
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:02,697
- There's lots of malls.
- l bet you miss it.

224
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:06,526
We're glad to be here.

225
00:26:07,902 --> 00:26:09,765
You know, wherever
the job takes us.

226
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,561
But this is different.

227
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:14,192
Yeah.

228
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:20,233
We were both
real popular in high school.

229
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:24,697
Now it just seems like we
don't know anybody anymore.

230
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,393
Well, living out here takes
some getting used to, l guess.

231
00:26:28,569 --> 00:26:30,831
Yeah. l guess it does.

232
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:33,902
lt must seem real different.

233
00:26:38,937 --> 00:26:41,732
Do you know where, like,
the mall's at in Odessa?

234
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:44,768
Sure. lt's easy to find.

235
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,662
Hey, man.

236
00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:25,505
You okay?

237
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:27,537
No.

238
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,203
This working hours?

239
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:40,402
Well, we're about to close.

240
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:44,666
You need to investigate them
Border Patrols that use the.223.

241
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,495
Want me to investigate the Kennedy
assassination while l'm at it?

242
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:52,231
Before you bitch, find out
what that fucker was involved with.

243
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:54,733
Melquiades wasn't
involved with nothing.

244
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:02,834
By the way, we already buried him.

245
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,741
l told you to notify me.

246
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:08,500
lt seemed like you'd at least...

247
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:12,304
...notify me.

248
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:17,573
You're not his family.
l don't have to notify you.

249
00:28:17,742 --> 00:28:19,640
He was a wetback.

250
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:51,740
- You like him?
- lt's the best horse l ever saw.

251
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:54,638
Take him, he's yours.

252
00:28:56,344 --> 00:28:59,072
Really, take him.

253
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:00,938
But it's your horse.

254
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:05,509
Mine, yours...
What's the difference?

255
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:10,074
He's got ''Pete'' branded in his brain.

256
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:16,970
No, he cost you a lot.

257
00:29:17,478 --> 00:29:21,501
Shit, don't even get off of him.

258
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,844
Hey, Bob, how long
we been married?

259
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,206
Twelve.

260
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:52,012
Hell, l don't know.

261
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,011
What day is it?

262
00:31:22,152 --> 00:31:23,743
Relax.

263
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:25,675
But the Border Patrol is everywhere.

264
00:31:25,852 --> 00:31:28,841
- lt's fine, man, don't worry.
- Where are you going?

265
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:31,109
Where do you think? To get the girls.

266
00:31:33,952 --> 00:31:35,884
Hurry up.

267
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:24,383
Could l see some photo lD, sir?

268
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:32,052
Girls, this is Melquiades.

269
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:35,213
- Lou Ann.
- Oh, Lou Ann.

270
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:39,986
- Nice to meet you.
- You work with Pete, right?

271
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:46,021
- That's the one from the cafe, right?
- Yes, genius.

272
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,780
- But she's married.
- So's the other one.

273
00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:49,286
Oh, shit.

274
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:06,514
That's y'all right down there, 205.

275
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:13,220
l gotta be back in two hours.

276
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:00,352
Wanna watch TV?

277
00:34:00,893 --> 00:34:02,826
Watch television?

278
00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:04,916
Want to?

279
00:34:18,427 --> 00:34:19,916
l'm sorry.

280
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:30,817
Music.

281
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:35,828
Okay.

282
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:44,755
Wanna dance?

283
00:35:57,432 --> 00:35:59,795
- You're not coming?
- No, l'll wait here.

284
00:35:59,966 --> 00:36:02,830
- You've always liked the mall.
- l'll wait.

285
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:06,055
But l don't wanna hurry,

286
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:08,926
l will wait for you here.

287
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:21,696
Don't smoke.

288
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:21,635
l love this song.

289
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:23,429
Crazy bitches...

290

l understand you people.
Believe you me, l do.

291
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:29,293
<i>And we are not loca. No way.</i>

292
00:38:19,274 --> 00:38:21,035
- Shit, what time is it?
-6:20.

293
00:38:21,207 --> 00:38:23,332
Fuck. Bob's gonna kill me.

294
00:38:24,307 --> 00:38:26,772
- When am l gonna see you again?
- l can't next week.

295
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,633
- Sheriff's turn?
- Stop it. You know how things are.

296
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,637
- All right, no problem.
- Hey, don't mix things up.

297
00:38:32,808 --> 00:38:35,001
You're the one l love,
darling, only one.

298
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:37,766
- Belmont's something else.
- What about old Bob?

299
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:40,004
That's different.
Bob's my husband.

300
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:41,572
You understand, right?

301
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,832
- Bye, Pete.
- Bye.

302
00:38:59,543 --> 00:39:01,065
Let's go.

303
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:02,874
Hey, man.

304
00:41:04,183 --> 00:41:05,910
You okay?

305
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:10,210
<i>You bueno?</i>

306
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,309
<i>You bueno?</i>

307
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:40,642
- How you doing, Sam?
- Just fine.

308
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:42,680
- Morning.
- Morning.

309
00:41:43,117 --> 00:41:46,277
l need to talk to you about
that dead Mexican y'all found.

310
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,779
What about it?

311
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:51,408
- l'd rather talk outside.
- All right.

312
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:04,073
lt's our new officer, Mike Norton.

313
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:06,842
Yeah. Little prick.

314
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:12,043
Apparently, he was out there
on the Boracho Peak, okay?

315
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:14,310
Shots were fired.

316
00:42:14,486 --> 00:42:15,974
And he returned.

317
00:42:16,152 --> 00:42:18,084
There was only
two of them out there.

318
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:22,150
Mike Norton, new kid from Cincinnati,
and that wetback.

319
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,251
Shots were fired?
Who fired at who?

320
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,578
He fired at him first.

321
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,945
Now, l don't want any shit.

322
00:42:59,221 --> 00:43:02,085
- What are you doing here?
- l need to talk to you.

323
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:05,747
What about?

324
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:09,211
- Belmont came by the cafי today.
- So what?

325
00:43:09,855 --> 00:43:12,377
Border Patrol by the name
of Gomez came looking.

326
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:13,782
So what?

327
00:43:15,122 --> 00:43:17,953
Gomez told him who killed
that Mexican.

328
00:43:25,556 --> 00:43:27,454
Don't fool with me, girl.

329
00:43:27,622 --> 00:43:29,417
Hell, no.

330
00:43:29,889 --> 00:43:32,878
He told Belmont a Border Patrol
killed him in a shootout.

331
00:43:33,056 --> 00:43:35,544
- Did he say his name?
- Yeah.

332
00:43:35,723 --> 00:43:38,087
A guy named Mike Norton.

333
00:43:39,057 --> 00:43:42,853
- You heard him say that?
- Said his name, like, three times.

334
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:46,319
- What are they gonna do with him?
- They didn't say.

335
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:10,115
- What's wrong with you? Goddamn!
- Arrest him.

336
00:44:10,292 --> 00:44:13,190
- Who do you think you are?
- That fellow who killed Melquiades.

337
00:44:13,357 --> 00:44:16,380
- Who would that be?
- That Border Patrolman, Mike Norton.

338
00:44:16,558 --> 00:44:19,956
- With what evidence?
- You know damn well who killed Mel.

339
00:44:20,126 --> 00:44:22,092
l don't know a goddamn thing.

340
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,747
You know damn well
who killed Melquiades.

341
00:44:25,492 --> 00:44:27,754
You ain't gonna arrest him, are you?

342
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:31,688
You better get out of here
before l throw your ass in jail.

343
00:44:35,992 --> 00:44:37,753
You ain't gonna arrest him.

344
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:09,792
Who is it?

345
00:46:09,965 --> 00:46:13,897
l'm here for Patrolman Norton.
Captain Gomez sent me.

346
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:15,792
Yeah, just a sec.

347
00:46:23,065 --> 00:46:24,963
You scream again, l'll kill you.

348
00:46:28,731 --> 00:46:30,697
Put your hands over your head.

349
00:46:33,933 --> 00:46:35,159
You got any handcuffs?

350
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:39,697
- Yeah. ln my uniform belt.
- Get them handcuffs in that uniform.

351
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:41,991
Bring them back in here
and keep quiet.

352
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,658
Do what he says, Lou Ann.

353
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:55,127
Put that uniform on
and then them handcuffs.

354
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,425
You tell her what you did?

355
00:47:11,067 --> 00:47:12,294
What did he do?

356
00:47:15,168 --> 00:47:17,998
He killed Melquiades Estrada.

357
00:47:37,203 --> 00:47:39,192
You need to try to relax.

358
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:51,660
Might get cold.

359
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,365
There we go.

360
00:47:55,536 --> 00:47:59,729
Now, if you call the police,
l'm gonna have to kill him, darling.

361
00:48:07,103 --> 00:48:09,365
<i>There's rain coming now
through Cincinnati.</i>

362
00:48:09,537 --> 00:48:12,798
<i>We could be looking at heavy rain
through the day on Friday...</i>

363
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:16,425
<i>...so flash flooding will be a huge
concern in the tri-state area.</i>

364
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:45,865
Get out.

365
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,400
You gonna kill me?

366
00:48:54,606 --> 00:48:56,094
Get out.

367
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,829
Dig him up.

368
00:49:20,974 --> 00:49:22,667
- Who?
- Melquiades Estrada...

369
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:27,967
...you stupid, gringo, son of a bitch.
You killed him, now dig him up.

370
00:49:30,508 --> 00:49:32,303
<i>Today's storm that swept Ohio...</i>

371
00:49:32,474 --> 00:49:35,235
<i>...sent dozens of vehicles
sliding on the roadways...</i>

372
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:38,170
<i>...forced hundreds of stores
and businesses to close.</i>

373
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:41,671
<i>Good news here is no one
was seriously injured.</i>

374
00:50:00,742 --> 00:50:02,469
Get him out.

375
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,102
Get out.

376
00:51:10,646 --> 00:51:12,544
Get around here.

377
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:20,413
Take him in the house.

378
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:29,740
Sit him on that bed.

379
00:51:39,248 --> 00:51:41,077
Turn that light on.

380
00:51:46,348 --> 00:51:47,905
Sit down at this table.

381
00:51:48,548 --> 00:51:50,537
ln that chair.

382
00:51:54,748 --> 00:51:57,236
Melquiades lived here.

383
00:51:58,015 --> 00:52:00,106
That was his bed.

384
00:52:01,249 --> 00:52:03,511
Kept his clothes right over there.

385
00:52:10,082 --> 00:52:11,605
That was his plate.

386
00:52:13,683 --> 00:52:15,876
And that was his cup.

387
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:26,339
Drink it.

388
00:52:30,684 --> 00:52:31,945
No.

389
00:52:37,617 --> 00:52:39,708
Drink from that cup.

390
00:52:59,418 --> 00:53:01,907
These was his work clothes.

391
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:07,283
Put them work clothes on.

392
00:53:07,452 --> 00:53:10,441
Then put them dress clothes
on Melquiades.

393
00:53:29,154 --> 00:53:32,586
The oldest is Elizabeth.
She must be fourteen.

394
00:53:32,854 --> 00:53:35,514
And Yesenia is probably twelve.

395
00:53:35,687 --> 00:53:39,518
And this little guy is Aaron.

396
00:53:39,787 --> 00:53:42,185
He's going to be a damn good cowboy.

397
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:46,081
And this is Evelia.

398
00:53:47,388 --> 00:53:50,047
Evelia Camargo, my wife.

399
00:53:51,921 --> 00:53:54,217
How long since you've seen them?

400
00:53:57,754 --> 00:53:59,448
About five years.

401
00:54:05,021 --> 00:54:07,010
Promise me one thing, Pete.

402
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:10,150
lf l die over here...

403
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,579
...carry me back to my family...

404
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:16,845
...and bury me in my hometown.

405
00:54:18,523 --> 00:54:22,319
l don't want to be buried on this side
among all the fucking billboards.

406
00:54:22,489 --> 00:54:25,216
l'll die before you will, l'm older.

407
00:54:25,389 --> 00:54:27,014
Promise me.

408
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,386
We're here, right?

409
00:54:34,557 --> 00:54:38,421
Go down to Ojinaga
and head south.

410
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:42,847
Then turn east and follow the sierra
until you come to Coahuila.

411
00:54:43,023 --> 00:54:45,854
Then you'll come to a town
called El Toston.

412
00:54:46,691 --> 00:54:49,851
Between El Toston
and El Nacimiento...

413
00:54:50,023 --> 00:54:52,785
...there's a little place
named Jimenez.

414
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:54,455
lt's my home.

415
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,955
Ask for Evelia, my wife,
and explain things to her.

416
00:54:58,358 --> 00:54:59,619
l'll just throw you in the trash.

417
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:01,849
You take me back to Jimenez, Pete.

418
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:05,119
You promised.

419
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:20,249
Come here.

420
00:55:26,492 --> 00:55:28,685
Sit down in that chair.

421
00:55:33,426 --> 00:55:34,790
l'll take them boots.

422
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,249
Oh, shit!

423
00:55:42,827 --> 00:55:44,054
All right.

424
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:45,924
Let's go.

425
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:47,457
Oh, fuck.

426
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:52,387
You fucker.

427
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:26,088
What did he leave
that uniform there for?

428
00:56:26,263 --> 00:56:27,751
Tell us he's crazy.

429
00:56:34,729 --> 00:56:37,161
What time did we find
this guy's wife?

430
00:56:37,662 --> 00:56:40,026
About 9:00 this morning.

431
00:56:44,697 --> 00:56:47,891
Goddamn crazy son of a bitch,
Pete Perkins.

432
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:49,957
What do you think?

433
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:59,026
l think the son of a bitch is crazy.

434
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:14,888
Right now they should be
somewhere here headed for Mexico.

435
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:17,463
What about that
heat-seeking radar y'all got?

436
00:57:17,632 --> 00:57:19,791
- lt don't work.
- They found four steers...

437
00:57:19,965 --> 00:57:24,057
...in a canyon on the Cross Bar
diamond this morning at about 3:00.

438
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,825
- What about rangers?
- Told them we had it covered.

439
00:57:26,999 --> 00:57:28,829
Be over by today.
Know what l mean?

440
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:31,693
There's 1000 ways he can go.
That son of a bitch...

441
00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:34,264
...is so fucking nuts
he might head to Canada.

442
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:36,296
We'll start with the Llano Largo...

443
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:39,432
...the Sierra Diablo
and the Arroyo Negro.

444
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,088
Where y'all going?

445
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:43,858
The rest of the
United States, l reckon.

446
00:57:44,633 --> 00:57:46,189
Due what?

447
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:50,593
We'll head southeast
over to Alarid Canyon.

448
00:58:11,635 --> 00:58:14,033
Where are we going?

449
00:58:16,435 --> 00:58:18,993
There's nowhere to go, man!

450
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:26,430
We're not going up there, are we?

451
00:58:27,002 --> 00:58:28,797
Shit.

452
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:38,037
Well, hell.

453
00:59:50,939 --> 00:59:52,565
This is Frank Belmont.

454
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:54,330
<i>What are you doing?</i>

455
00:59:55,206 --> 00:59:56,831
l'm at work.

456
00:59:57,507 --> 00:59:59,405
<i>Am I gonna see you today?</i>

457
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:04,299
Yeah, all right.

458
01:00:04,474 --> 01:00:06,463
<i>Same time, same place?</i>

459
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,600
<i>- Yeah, l guess.
- Good.</i>

460
01:00:12,774 --> 01:00:15,797
<i>Stop at the store
and pick up a pack of Kotex.</i>

461
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,839
Shit!

462
01:02:00,546 --> 01:02:01,807
Get out.

463
01:02:02,646 --> 01:02:04,340
Get out.

464
01:02:15,881 --> 01:02:18,972
Shit, shit, shit!

465
01:02:19,881 --> 01:02:21,279
What am l doing here?

466
01:02:22,414 --> 01:02:24,811
Well, it's our duty, sir.

467
01:02:24,981 --> 01:02:26,311
Shut up.

468
01:02:54,883 --> 01:02:56,281
Where are you going?

469
01:02:56,749 --> 01:02:59,079
He stinks, man. l can't sleep.

470
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,943
Get back over there
where you was at.

471
01:03:39,886 --> 01:03:41,374
Hey.

472
01:03:43,685 --> 01:03:45,275
Hey, you.

473
01:03:45,852 --> 01:03:47,681
My name's Pete.

474
01:03:50,919 --> 01:03:52,578
Well, Pete...

475
01:03:53,418 --> 01:03:55,680
...the ants are eating your friend.

476
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,381
Fucker.

477
01:04:07,353 --> 01:04:09,216
Goddamn!

478
01:04:57,622 --> 01:04:58,952
All right.

479
01:05:38,424 --> 01:05:40,652
Get down and don't try nothing.

480
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:00,085
Who's there?

481
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,121
l don't speak Spanish.
What do you want?

482
01:06:18,993 --> 01:06:21,482
We're friends. Wanted some
water for our horses.

483
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,055
Well, help yourself, then.

484
01:06:25,226 --> 01:06:28,192
l like listening to this
Mexican radio station.

485
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,553
l can't understand anything...

486
01:06:30,728 --> 01:06:34,160
...but l like the way
Spanish sounds, don't you?

487
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,583
Yes, sir.

488
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:38,887
Sounds all right.

489
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,253
Smells like something
dead around here.

490
01:06:41,427 --> 01:06:44,552
l killed a deer a couple days ago.
lt's starting to turn.

491
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:49,252
Yeah? Well, you better
throw it away. lt's rotten.

492
01:06:49,427 --> 01:06:53,291
l wanna keep the hide. You got
any salt l could use to cure it?

493
01:06:53,462 --> 01:06:57,224
No, son. l barely got enough salt
to put on the dinner table.

494
01:06:57,395 --> 01:06:59,953
You got any alcohol
or anything like that?

495
01:07:00,128 --> 01:07:02,560
l got a jug of antifreeze.

496
01:07:03,128 --> 01:07:04,458
Would that work?

497
01:07:20,997 --> 01:07:23,394
Suck on this hose.

498
01:07:51,031 --> 01:07:53,690
Them ants won't eat
him anymore after this.

499
01:07:54,998 --> 01:07:56,520
You're crazy.

500
01:07:58,698 --> 01:08:00,687
You're totally fucking crazy, man.

501
01:08:00,865 --> 01:08:03,127
Y'all come and eat!

502
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,391
Let us pray.

503
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:54,525
Dear Lord...

504
01:08:54,701 --> 01:08:56,462
...we thank you for this meal...

505
01:08:56,635 --> 01:08:59,760
...and for bringing me these friends
and our daily bread...

506
01:08:59,934 --> 01:09:02,900
...and all the animals
and all the beast in the field.

507
01:09:03,068 --> 01:09:04,728
Amen.

508
01:09:16,135 --> 01:09:17,998
You live alone?

509
01:09:18,702 --> 01:09:23,225
l've got a son that comes and sees me
every month and brings me food.

510
01:09:23,402 --> 01:09:26,800
But it's been six months
since he was here.

511
01:09:29,637 --> 01:09:31,000
What do you live on?

512
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,662
l got some things stored away.

513
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:48,568
Thank you.

514
01:09:48,738 --> 01:09:51,863
- l'd like to ask you a favor.
- Anything you want.

515
01:09:52,237 --> 01:09:53,703
l wanted to ask you...

516
01:09:55,638 --> 01:09:57,604
...if you can shoot me.

517
01:10:01,905 --> 01:10:04,496
My son ain't coming back.

518
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:10,194
Oh, he'll come back.

519
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,634
No, he told me he had cancer.

520
01:10:14,839 --> 01:10:17,896
And he told me to
go back to town with him.

521
01:10:20,006 --> 01:10:23,335
But l don't wanna go,
because l've always lived here.

522
01:10:23,939 --> 01:10:25,768
Well, we can't do it.

523
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:30,099
l don't wanna offend God
by killing myself.

524
01:10:30,274 --> 01:10:32,297
lt's a problem.

525
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:37,572
We don't wanna offend God either.

526
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,503
lt would be the best thing to do.

527
01:10:45,473 --> 01:10:47,564
You're good people.

528
01:10:50,706 --> 01:10:52,638
You need to go ahead
and shoot me.

529
01:10:54,141 --> 01:10:57,800
You know, l'm innocent actually.

530
01:10:58,574 --> 01:11:01,234
l didn't mean
to kill your friend, man.

531
01:11:02,741 --> 01:11:05,367
He shot at me, all right?

532
01:11:06,908 --> 01:11:09,669
And l swear to God,
really, if l could...

533
01:11:15,742 --> 01:11:18,072
You let me go and l promise--

534
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,165
l swear.

535
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,864
l promise l will not press charges.

536
01:11:24,808 --> 01:11:26,502
Where's that son of a bitch at?

537
01:11:26,675 --> 01:11:28,005
l don't know.

538
01:11:28,175 --> 01:11:30,834
You ought to,
you've been fucking him.

539
01:11:35,377 --> 01:11:37,468
We don't talk a lot.

540
01:12:04,711 --> 01:12:06,142
God almighty.

541
01:12:07,977 --> 01:12:10,136
Get this horse off of me.

542
01:12:10,778 --> 01:12:12,767
Get up, Bill, get up.

543
01:12:12,944 --> 01:12:14,672
Come on.

544
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:17,374
Come on, come on, come on. Up.

545
01:12:24,045 --> 01:12:26,511
Goddamn, Bill, get up.

546
01:12:27,879 --> 01:12:29,105
Whoa, Bill.

547
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:29,886
Fucking motherfuck!

548
01:16:58,525 --> 01:17:00,014
Shit!

549
01:17:09,927 --> 01:17:11,893
Help!

550
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,549
Help!

551
01:17:15,826 --> 01:17:17,520
Help!

552
01:17:50,828 --> 01:17:52,851
- Good afternoon, sir.
- How do you do?

553
01:17:53,029 --> 01:17:55,825
Sir, have you seen anyone
coming through this area...

554
01:17:55,995 --> 01:17:58,120
...or in this general area
on horseback?

555
01:17:58,296 --> 01:18:00,854
Like, maybe two men? Horseback?

556
01:18:01,029 --> 01:18:03,860
Maybe with a couple
pack horses or mules?

557
01:18:04,029 --> 01:18:06,393
l ain't seen anybody in 30 years.

558
01:18:06,896 --> 01:18:09,828
All right. l am sorry, sir.

559
01:18:09,996 --> 01:18:14,486
Have you heard anyone come this way
in the past few days or hours?

560
01:18:14,664 --> 01:18:16,095
Are y'all cops?

561
01:18:16,263 --> 01:18:18,729
No, sir, we're actually
with the Border Patrol.

562
01:18:19,163 --> 01:18:21,152
Ain't no Mexicans
come through here.

563
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:24,091
We're not looking for Mexicans.

564
01:18:27,063 --> 01:18:29,359
- No one come through.
- Are you sure?

565
01:18:29,531 --> 01:18:31,963
Hell, no, l'm not sure.

566
01:18:32,131 --> 01:18:33,427
But l don't think so.

567
01:18:33,598 --> 01:18:36,086
Okay. Do you need anything?

568
01:18:38,865 --> 01:18:40,387
No.

569
01:18:41,698 --> 01:18:43,687
All right, we're moving out.

570
01:19:01,532 --> 01:19:03,589
This way, hurry up!

571
01:19:09,299 --> 01:19:11,163
Watch out.
That's a rattlesnake.

572
01:19:11,332 --> 01:19:13,457
He's not gonna bite anybody.

573
01:19:14,134 --> 01:19:15,963
A dead guy!

574
01:19:49,168 --> 01:19:50,656
He's still breathing.

575
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:53,594
- l think that snake bit him.
- He sure did.

576
01:19:53,768 --> 01:19:56,928
- ls he a gringo?
- He looks too fucked up to be a gringo.

577
01:19:57,102 --> 01:19:58,500
Has he got money?

578
01:20:00,202 --> 01:20:02,724
l think it's too late.

579
01:20:06,336 --> 01:20:08,597
Take it easy. l'm a friend.

580
01:20:10,603 --> 01:20:12,795
- We didn't do nothing, mister.
- l know it.

581
01:20:12,969 --> 01:20:15,696
- What happened to him?
- He was bite by a snake.

582
01:20:16,436 --> 01:20:17,958
He's dying.

583
01:20:18,137 --> 01:20:20,433
You know where
we can get some help?

584
01:20:21,604 --> 01:20:25,593
l know a girl who is good with herbs.
Maybe she can cure him.

585
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:27,600
But she lives across the border.

586
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,703
ls it far?

587
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:31,564
The border is not far.

588
01:20:31,736 --> 01:20:34,100
<i>But la Migra is all around.</i>

589
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:38,293
<i>They are looking for a gringo
who kidnap a Migra agent.</i>

590
01:20:41,004 --> 01:20:42,231
You're the gringo.

591
01:20:46,871 --> 01:20:48,064
Yes.

592
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:55,161
Can you help me get him across?
l don't want him to die.

593
01:20:57,538 --> 01:21:01,834
Tomas, keep going with them.
l'll take the gringo to get cured.

594
01:21:19,906 --> 01:21:21,371
l'm leaving.

595
01:21:22,339 --> 01:21:23,566
You're leaving.

596
01:21:24,307 --> 01:21:25,739
Yes.

597
01:21:27,206 --> 01:21:28,866
l hate this place.

598
01:21:29,573 --> 01:21:31,539
Maybe he'll come back.

599
01:21:31,707 --> 01:21:33,332
l don't care.

600
01:21:33,907 --> 01:21:35,532
He'll come back, honey.

601
01:21:35,941 --> 01:21:37,634
l don't care.

602
01:21:39,273 --> 01:21:41,739
The son of a bitch
is beyond redemption.

603
01:21:56,341 --> 01:21:58,001
l'm leaving him.

604
01:22:05,008 --> 01:22:07,872
- Can you get us across?
- Yes.

605
01:22:08,043 --> 01:22:11,372
But l've never crossed people
from this side to that side.

606
01:22:12,309 --> 01:22:15,299
- Much less on horses.
- Okay, take us.

607
01:22:15,475 --> 01:22:17,373
- What about the price?
- What price?

608
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:19,405
The price to cross you.

609
01:22:19,575 --> 01:22:21,598
lt's 1000 a person.

610
01:22:22,876 --> 01:22:25,274
l don't have $ 1000.

611
01:22:25,442 --> 01:22:28,738
Three-thousand dollars.
A thousand for you.

612
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,933
And 1000 for the gringo.
And 1000 for the dead guy.

613
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:33,598
Shit.

614
01:22:34,743 --> 01:22:36,834
l'll find a way to get across.

615
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:41,937
Okay, let's make a deal.

616
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:43,700
Give me your rifle...

617
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:45,866
...and your horse.

618
01:22:47,077 --> 01:22:48,702
No.

619
01:23:02,078 --> 01:23:04,942
All right, l'll give you the horse.
But not my horse.

620
01:23:05,111 --> 01:23:07,168
- The other horse.
- And the rifle.

621
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:08,838
Just the horse.

622
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:12,574
Okay, done deal.

623
01:23:15,779 --> 01:23:17,211
Okay.

624
01:23:29,446 --> 01:23:31,344
This is where we cross.

625
01:23:31,513 --> 01:23:34,536
- ls the water deep?
- A little.

626
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:45,010
No! No, goddamn it! No!

627

Fuck you, sons of bitches!

What the hell is this on me?

631
01:23:56,848 --> 01:23:58,780
You sons of bitches!

632
01:23:58,948 --> 01:24:00,209
Fuck you!

633
01:24:00,848 --> 01:24:04,905

01:24:08,515 --> 01:24:10,378
Fuck you!

636

Fuck!

637
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,944
- Dona Adriana, is Mariana at home?
- Yes, she is.

638
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,879
What's going on?

639
01:25:11,252 --> 01:25:13,513
ls this the one that got snakebit?

640
01:25:17,785 --> 01:25:20,149
Get this gringo out of here.
He's the one that broke my nose.

641
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:21,409
You sure?

642
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:23,550
Hell yes,
he's got a face like a white rat.

643
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:25,480
- He'll probably die.
- Let him die.

644
01:25:26,253 --> 01:25:27,980
Please...

645
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:33,843
...heal him.

646
01:25:34,086 --> 01:25:35,847
Why?

647
01:25:36,585 --> 01:25:38,108
Because...

648
01:25:38,953 --> 01:25:41,351
...l need him alive.

649
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:05,717
Will he get well?

650
01:27:10,557 --> 01:27:11,887
From the poison, yes.

651
01:27:12,057 --> 01:27:16,820
But if he gets gangrene,
we'll have to cut his foot off.

652
01:29:14,951 --> 01:29:16,940
Your call is ready.

653
01:29:32,918 --> 01:29:35,407
Sands Restaurant, how may
l help you? This is Rachel.

654
01:29:35,586 --> 01:29:37,279
<i>Rachel.</i>

655
01:29:38,452 --> 01:29:39,849
Pete?

656
01:29:40,018 --> 01:29:41,678
Where are you?

657
01:29:41,853 --> 01:29:43,943
<i>I'm in Mexico.</i>

658
01:29:44,118 --> 01:29:46,380
You know the Border Patrol
is on your ass?

659
01:29:48,019 --> 01:29:50,110
What's Belmont doing?

660
01:29:50,653 --> 01:29:53,551
He went on vacation. He said he
had nothing to do with this.

661
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:57,777
Said it's between you and the Border
Patrol, and he wanna go to SeaWorld.

662
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,909
<i>Rachel...</i>

663
01:30:05,954 --> 01:30:08,943
...l want you to come to Mexico.

664
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:11,181
<i>What for?</i>

665
01:30:12,821 --> 01:30:14,446
Marry me.

666
01:30:14,621 --> 01:30:16,052
Be my wife.

667
01:30:18,221 --> 01:30:20,779
Are you crazy? l can't do that.

668
01:30:22,187 --> 01:30:24,176
<i>Why not?</i>

669
01:30:25,154 --> 01:30:27,347
Because l love Bob, Pete.

670
01:30:29,155 --> 01:30:32,451
You said l was the only you loved.

671
01:30:35,156 --> 01:30:38,986
Pete, you don't understand.
l have to go. Take care.

672
01:32:25,294 --> 01:32:29,454
We'll get you home pretty soon,
Melquiades.

673
01:32:30,428 --> 01:32:32,690
Any day now.

674
01:32:39,194 --> 01:32:41,626
You look like hell, son.

675
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:25,359
Good morning.

676
01:33:29,764 --> 01:33:31,025
Where am l?

677
01:33:34,664 --> 01:33:37,130
Mexico. Shit.

678
01:33:38,231 --> 01:33:42,561
- Who are you, man?
- Your private 911, dude.

679
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:45,861
The gringo asshole woke up.

680
01:33:48,432 --> 01:33:50,126
She's gonna check you up.

681
01:33:52,266 --> 01:33:54,925
Easy. Easy.

682
01:33:56,765 --> 01:33:58,594
Drink.

683
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:01,231
- ls there hot coffee?
- Fresh made.

684
01:34:01,432 --> 01:34:03,058
Bring me the pot.

685
01:34:13,967 --> 01:34:16,694
Now we're even, asshole.

686
01:34:46,934 --> 01:34:48,594
You want to help us?

687
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:05,662
We'll have to walk it from here.

688
01:36:10,906 --> 01:36:12,565
Shit.

689
01:36:21,306 --> 01:36:22,636
Come here.

690
01:37:06,142 --> 01:37:10,404
You try to run away again, l'll kill you.
l guess you know that by now.

691
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:11,563
Yes, sir.

692
01:37:24,277 --> 01:37:26,243
<i>Do you even know how much
new tires cost?</i>

693
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:29,739
<i>Do you even know what the mileage
on your little foreign car is?</i>

694
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:33,399
<i>Do you know when the oil change
is due? Tell me. I want you to tell me.</i>

695
01:37:33,576 --> 01:37:36,270
<i>Johnny, is there someone else?</i>

696
01:37:36,444 --> 01:37:38,773
<i>What do you mean?
Someone else what?</i>

697
01:37:38,943 --> 01:37:41,171
<i>Someone else putting
a roof over your head?</i>

698
01:37:41,344 --> 01:37:43,207
<i>- Someone paying the bills--?
- Johnny.</i>

699
01:37:43,377 --> 01:37:46,672
<i>You've been so distant,
so far away. I cook. I clean house.</i>

700
01:37:46,844 --> 01:37:49,037
<i>I wonder what your mother
would say. I do.</i>

701
01:37:49,211 --> 01:37:50,972
<i>My mother has no say.</i>

702
01:37:51,144 --> 01:37:54,599
<i>Do you think she cares about me?
You think she cares about you?</i>

703
01:37:58,345 --> 01:37:59,742
<i>No, it's not.</i>

704
01:37:59,911 --> 01:38:02,377
<i>She is addicted to vodka
and Valium, and she is...</i>

705
01:38:02,545 --> 01:38:05,738
- You want some coffee?
- Yes, sir. Please.

706
01:38:09,778 --> 01:38:13,370
<i>No, she is not. She is not.</i>

707
01:38:13,546 --> 01:38:14,773
<i>Oh, yes, I do care.</i>

708
01:38:18,279 --> 01:38:19,711
Sit down.

709
01:38:21,212 --> 01:38:24,736
<i>I gave up a scholarship
to State University to take this job--</i>

710
01:38:24,912 --> 01:38:26,572
Can you sell us some food?

711
01:38:26,746 --> 01:38:29,007
l'll give it to you.

712
01:38:29,747 --> 01:38:31,576
We have fresh meat.

713
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,847
Take what you want.

714
01:38:37,413 --> 01:38:39,402
We had to kill him.

715
01:38:39,614 --> 01:38:42,444
This fucking bear was killing
too many goats.

716
01:38:43,614 --> 01:38:45,637
<i>No, it's not.
It's that girl from the...</i>

717
01:38:45,881 --> 01:38:49,574
- ls this Coahuila?
- Yes, you're right here in Coahuila.

718
01:38:50,681 --> 01:38:53,738
Do you know how to get to El Toston?

719
01:38:55,848 --> 01:38:57,905
Twenty kilometers that way.

720
01:38:58,448 --> 01:39:00,971
<i>I'm not stupid, Johnny.
I've got eyes in my head.</i>

721
01:39:01,147 --> 01:39:04,910
When you hit the sierra,
head south and you'll get there.

722
01:39:06,982 --> 01:39:09,140
<i>You're throwing your life away,
Johnny.</i>

723
01:39:09,314 --> 01:39:11,177
<i>Don't do it. Please don't do it.</i>

724
01:39:11,348 --> 01:39:14,439
l've seen that. l know this one.

725
01:39:14,616 --> 01:39:17,275
<i>Please. Please. Please.</i>

726
01:39:17,449 --> 01:39:20,109
<i>You see, that's it.
That's exactly it, right there.</i>

727
01:39:20,282 --> 01:39:24,079
<i>That's what I'm talking about. It's
always the same, always the same.</i>

728
01:39:25,083 --> 01:39:27,015
<i>Johnny.</i>

729
01:39:27,183 --> 01:39:28,512
What'd the guy on TV say?

730
01:39:28,682 --> 01:39:30,443
<i>We used to be so happy.</i>

731
01:39:30,616 --> 01:39:32,707
Let's go.

732
01:39:37,416 --> 01:39:38,780
Take it...

733
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:40,347
...for your troubles.

734
01:39:41,084 --> 01:39:42,913
<i>We were happy then.</i>

735
01:39:43,084 --> 01:39:44,743
<i>And we'll be happy again.</i>

736
01:39:44,917 --> 01:39:46,281
<i>I know it.</i>

737
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:49,541
<i>Please, don't cry.</i>

738
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:53,581
<i>There will always be
a River Valley for us.</i>

739
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:56,675
<i>I hope so, Johnny.</i>

740
01:39:56,851 --> 01:39:59,079
<i>I hope so.</i>

741
01:40:55,053 --> 01:40:57,780
- Yes, it's $2.
- You speak English.

742
01:40:57,953 --> 01:41:00,976
Yeah, everyone here speak English.

743
01:41:01,154 --> 01:41:03,416
We were worked on the other side.

744
01:41:03,588 --> 01:41:07,281
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for a town called Jimיnez.

745
01:41:07,455 --> 01:41:09,387
Jimיnez?

746
01:41:10,355 --> 01:41:13,685
No, there's no place like that here.

747
01:41:14,021 --> 01:41:16,749
Do you know of a place
called Jimenez?

748
01:41:20,421 --> 01:41:22,080
Manuel...

749
01:41:22,388 --> 01:41:25,081
...you ever hear of Jimenez?

750
01:41:25,589 --> 01:41:27,248
Jimיnez?

751
01:41:27,723 --> 01:41:30,348
No, not around here.

752
01:41:34,389 --> 01:41:39,321
They said it was a little village
about 10 kilometers away.

753
01:41:43,289 --> 01:41:48,483
No, the only village around
here is called Los Chilicotes.

754
01:41:48,657 --> 01:41:51,122
Do you know this woman?

755
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:54,154
Her name is Evelia Camargo.

756
01:41:55,123 --> 01:41:57,351
Yeah, l know her.

757
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:01,385
But her name's not Evelia.

758
01:42:01,557 --> 01:42:02,818
lt's Rosa.

759
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:05,917
Do you know that man?

760
01:42:07,358 --> 01:42:11,086
He's the one lived in Jimיnez.
His name is Melquiades Estrada.

761
01:42:12,191 --> 01:42:13,953
No, we don't him.

762
01:42:17,025 --> 01:42:19,048
What's he doing with that woman?

763
01:42:21,058 --> 01:42:22,853
l don't know.

764
01:42:25,424 --> 01:42:27,481
Why you don't ask her?

765
01:42:28,959 --> 01:42:30,652
She lives around the corner.

766
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:46,686
You speak English?

767
01:42:52,527 --> 01:42:55,459
Well, seסora...

768
01:42:56,227 --> 01:43:00,659
...Melquiades was a good friend.
l'm sorry to tell you he's passed away.

769
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,692
Who is Melquiades?

770
01:43:05,793 --> 01:43:07,622
Melquiades, your husband.

771
01:43:08,261 --> 01:43:10,852
He's passed away and l've brought
his body back from Texas.

772
01:43:11,027 --> 01:43:14,084
l don't know anyone
named Melquiades.

773
01:43:16,828 --> 01:43:20,692
Well, this is you and that's him.

774
01:43:22,528 --> 01:43:24,427
What are you doing
with a photo of me and my kids?

775
01:43:24,594 --> 01:43:26,458
Melquiades gave it to me.

776
01:43:28,861 --> 01:43:32,588
Please, seסora,
you can tell me the truth.

777
01:43:32,761 --> 01:43:34,784
He was a good friend of mine.

778
01:43:34,962 --> 01:43:36,588
You were married to him,
weren't you?

779
01:43:36,762 --> 01:43:38,955
Don't talk foolishness.

780
01:43:39,129 --> 01:43:42,118
Because you'll get me in trouble
with my husband, Javier Martinez...

781
01:43:42,296 --> 01:43:43,818
...and we don't know any Melquiades.

782
01:43:46,663 --> 01:43:49,595
Excuse me, ma'am.
l didn't want to offend you.

783
01:43:50,396 --> 01:43:52,487
But Melquiades was my friend.

784
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:57,055
Go see Don Casimiro.

785
01:43:58,063 --> 01:44:00,495
He knows everybody
that comes through town.

786
01:44:01,097 --> 01:44:02,824
Maybe he can help you.

787
01:44:08,430 --> 01:44:09,794
No.

788
01:44:11,397 --> 01:44:12,624
l don't know him.

789
01:44:16,564 --> 01:44:19,530
You know anything about
a little town called Jimיnez?

790
01:44:19,698 --> 01:44:21,323
No.

791
01:44:21,998 --> 01:44:24,692
lt doesn't exist around here.

792
01:44:31,031 --> 01:44:33,088
l know for sure.

793
01:44:34,698 --> 01:44:36,357
lt doesn't exist.

794
01:44:37,031 --> 01:44:38,292
Why?

795
01:44:50,799 --> 01:44:52,094
Your friend lied to you.

796
01:44:52,266 --> 01:44:55,096
- No, he didn't.
- Sure he did.

797
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,026
There's no Jimיnez, man.

798
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,962
Wake up.

799
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:43,366
- That place doesn't exist.
- Yes, it does.

800
01:45:47,569 --> 01:45:51,968
There is no fucking Jimיnez, man!

801
01:45:54,169 --> 01:45:56,657
Don't you see? There's no Jimיnez!

802
01:45:56,836 --> 01:45:58,665
lt exists.

803
01:45:59,336 --> 01:46:01,961
Jimenez is a beautiful fucking place.

804
01:46:03,169 --> 01:46:05,498
lt sits between two hills.

805
01:46:07,304 --> 01:46:09,667
The air is so clear there...

806
01:46:09,837 --> 01:46:13,031
...you feel like you can hug
the mountains with your arms.

807
01:46:14,404 --> 01:46:18,665
A stream of clear clean fresh water
bubbles up right out of the rocks there.

808
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:22,033
lf you go to Jimenez...

809
01:46:23,337 --> 01:46:27,792
...l swear to you your heart will break
with so much beauty.

810
01:47:09,972 --> 01:47:12,302
This is Jimenez.

811
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,668
lt's just like Mel said it was.

812
01:47:25,541 --> 01:47:27,598
Got good water.

813
01:47:31,741 --> 01:47:33,263
And...

814
01:47:34,708 --> 01:47:36,731
...that's the house.

815
01:47:40,575 --> 01:47:42,837
Store's right over yonder.

816
01:47:49,375 --> 01:47:50,602
Graveyard.

817
01:48:00,943 --> 01:48:02,408
Garden.

818
01:48:02,576 --> 01:48:04,303
Right there.

819
01:48:05,476 --> 01:48:06,908
See?

820
01:48:09,809 --> 01:48:12,173
Just like that right there.

821
01:48:13,576 --> 01:48:15,235
See?

822
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:19,837
Yeah.

823
01:48:22,343 --> 01:48:23,934
This is it.

824
01:48:26,144 --> 01:48:28,201
You found it, Pete.

825
01:48:31,011 --> 01:48:32,408
Well...

826
01:48:34,077 --> 01:48:36,043
...get down.

827
01:50:16,783 --> 01:50:19,374
You got a grave to dig.

828
01:51:38,021 --> 01:51:39,953
Ask Melquiades for forgiveness.

829
01:51:40,121 --> 01:51:42,848
- What?
- Ask for forgiveness.

830
01:51:44,554 --> 01:51:48,248
Ask for forgiveness right now
or go to hell right now.

831
01:51:48,954 --> 01:51:50,715
l don't believe in hell.

832
01:52:00,355 --> 01:52:01,820

lt was a mistake.

837
01:52:42,823 --> 01:52:44,948
l didn't want it to happen.

838
01:52:55,391 --> 01:52:59,517
lt hurts me, and l regret it...

839
01:52:59,691 --> 01:53:02,179

To your wife.

01:54:41,629 --> 01:54:42,959
Wherever.

l always thought that
you'd end up killing me.

852
01:55:06,031 --> 01:55:08,088

853
01:55:08,864 --> 01:55:10,228
...son.

01:56:05,834 --> 01:56:08,356

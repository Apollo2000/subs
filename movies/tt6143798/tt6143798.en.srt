1
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:59,913
Unit three,
in position on upper level.

2
00:00:59,913 --> 00:01:02,043
Roving patrols
are active on two and four.

3
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:04,840
- We have a live tap on all cameras, 10-2.

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,630
East stairwell is clear.

5
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,460
We have
the top exit in sight.

6
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,293
Affirmative.

7
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:11,242
- Continue your sweep, floor by floor.

8
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:12,843
Red team fan out.

9
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,550
Unit seven
staging at upper level.

10
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,889
Rolling unit signal is 10-1.

11
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:43,727
Expecting a
possible magnetic signature.

12
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,790
Red team, clear the third floor.

13
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,493
- Is that him?

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,783
No, that's not
Hawks, just some idiot.

15
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:34,633
- What's he doing?

16
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,303
- He's lifting it.

17
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,778
- You see, this is why
I love you older models,

18
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:43,443
a little more hands-on,
a little more intimate,

19
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,430
and with just the right
kind of gentle touch,

20
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,847
we should be--

21
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,100
That's him, move in.

22
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,227
All teams move in.

23
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,120
- Code three, all units.
- All units, target confirmed.

24
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,453
10-32 units
four through seven hold.

25
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:01,960
Subject is in black SUV.

26
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,480
- I'm stealing this car.

27
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,313
- I hate to break it to your bud,

28
00:03:04,313 --> 00:03:06,273
but I'm kinda already stealing it.

29
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:07,106
- Then drive.

30
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,163
- What?

31
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:11,467
No, no, no, no, no,
this can't be happening.

32
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,420
- Look, in about 60 seconds,

33
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,480
a bunch of guys with guns
are gonna kill us both

34
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,143
if you don't do as I say,
drive!

35
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,680
- Hey man, I don't know if you had like

36
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,030
a really shit day at work or something,

37
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,630
believe it or not, I can relate.

38
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,010
- Shut up and drive!

39
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,493
- Okay, all right, all right.

40
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,680
- Here they come!

41
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:46,914
I want the device.

42
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:51,206
- Let's move!

43
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:52,039
- Go!

44
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,326
- Well, there's no
returning this thing now.

45
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,110
- Go, go, go, man go!

46
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,250
- Drive faster.

47
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,750
- What, did you steal from a
classic car club or something?

48
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,563
- They take anything they want.

49
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:36,396
- Jesus!

50
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,143
- Do you mind telling me
what the hell's going on.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,073
- I made a mistake.

52
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,541
- What?

53
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,870
- I made something, something
that could change everything

54
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,567
the whole world but, I shared
it with the wrong people.

55
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,650
- I didn't know.

56
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,540
- Okay, well that
literally could not explain

57
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,730
any less information
as to what is going on?

58
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,963
- I can't explain it.

59
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,300
I have something, these people chasing us

60
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,560
because they want it.

61
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,010
- I'm assuming it's in the case.

62
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,035
The thing they want?

63
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:19,030
Not the most discreet
method of transporting

64
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,803
important secret things, just FYI

65
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,340
- Oh this is perfect, I hitched
a ride with a car thief,

66
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,350
who also happens to be
a sarcastic horse's ass

67
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,275
- You did not hitch a ride,

68
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:31,657
you hitch a ride with a thumb not a gun!

69
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:42,610
- What's with that suit anyway.

70
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,986
- I was at a funeral

71
00:05:43,986 --> 00:05:45,568
- You wore THAT to a funeral?

72
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:48,285
Look out!

73
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:53,821
- Hey, I hate to further my
impression as a sarcastic dick,

74
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,580
but that gun might be useful to shoot

75
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,480
at the people that are shooting at us!

76
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,838
- It's a pellet gun.

77
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,346
- ...And we're going to die!

78
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,753
I'm not a car thief, by the way.

79
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:05,863
- I don't care.

80
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,620
- My old man was a car
thief, it was his funeral.

81
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,063
- I'm sorry, ours could be next.

82
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,110
- I was supposed to leave
to go back home this morning

83
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,033
but I had one thing I just had to do.

84
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,385
- I should be getting
on a plane right now.

85
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:38,830
- Where is it?
- What?

86
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,580
We gotta get the hell out of here.

87
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:45,978
- Home! Where is home?

88
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:47,142
- New York City, Why?

89
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:53,378
- Put your hand on this.

90
00:06:53,378 --> 00:06:54,353
- Uh, no thanks.

91
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,133
- The device, put your hand on it.

92
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:11,475
Shoot, shoot!

93
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,442
- What is this?

94
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:15,600
- It's what they want.

95
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,170
- I can get you out of this.
Okay?

96
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,180
You just have to trust me.

97
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,767
- Okay!

98
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:23,890
Go, go!

99
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,610
- We haven't done human testing
yet, but it should work.

100
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,443
- Wait, what?!

101
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:32,560
- The arrogance of
humans, they somehow think

102
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,793
they are superior to
the rodent population.

103
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:38,960
- All right, all right,
just tell me how it works.

104
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,310
- Think about where you live,
the address, the neighborhood,

105
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,760
the inside of your apartment,
what it looks like,

106
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,670
every sense you can imagine.

107
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,503
- Okay, got it.

108
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,330
- Can you see?
- Yes I see it.

109
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,430
- Do you wish you were there?

110
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,939
- Yes.
- Do you?!

111
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,856
- Yes, YES!

112
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:00,569

140
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,030
- Unfortunately, prayer is
not gonna fix this situation.

141
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,113
- Teams are on the scene now, they're,

142
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,210
they're cover is forensics.

143
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,073
- Forensics, that's cute.

144
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,220
So what do they know.

145
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,053
- Not much.

146
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:02,560
- Two were inside that SUV,
and we have zero information.

147
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,510
- well I'm not surprised,
have you seen what was left?

148
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,353
- Who hasn't?

149
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,110
Tomas Hawks is dead.

150
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,060
No one could have survived that blast.

151
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,040
The case the device was in, is charred.

152
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,770
But the accelerator is gone,
and no one was seen escaping.

153
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,330
- So what that tell us?

154
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,710
- The goddamn thing works,

155
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,180
any progress tracking it down?

156
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,160
- Nothing at this time.

157
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,243
- Damage control?

158
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:30,290
- Amanda's on it now,
she's already got an edit

159
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,710
on all the new stories.

160
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,970
- Let me be very clear on this Sy,

161
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,533
word on this cannot get out.

162
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:40,140
- I agree, but there are
clarity of detail issues.

163
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,570
- No witnesses, no outside knowledge.

164
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,493
- I wanna send someone in who
can help us get the job done.

165
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,153
I was considering sending Brink.

166
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,800
- He is terminated as an asset.

167
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,820
- No, he can help us get what we want.

168
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,140
And he can cut down on
any unforeseen problems.

169
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,540
- Brink is a psychopath,
walking collateral damage, Sy

170
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,290
you have a small army at your disposal,

171
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,710
will you use it and bring this thing back?

172
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,965
Or there will be a troubling

173
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,370
lack of inter-agency cooperation.

174
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:19,163
- Ray, why that has to be the
most polite veiled threat,

175
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,243
I've ever heard.

176
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,870
- So, there must be a reason
you didn't share the news

177
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,070
about the giant magnetic
surge in lower Manhattan?

178
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,097
- The teams are en route.

179
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:35,200
- Because that could be
considered as operationally

180
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,160
sort of a hostile act.

181
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,980
- We don't have a precise location yet.

182
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,960
Besides this is how we keep our edge.

183
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,770
- Well, I'm not sure
that's a good excuse--

184
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,603
- Amanda?

185
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,533
Information is power.

186
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,490
When the team lands I want the
jet refueled and ready to go.

187
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,393
- Going somewhere?

188
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,134
- To see an old friend.

189
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,760
In Miami, federal
authorities have confirmed

190
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,890
that yesterday's pursuit
and the subsequent explosion

191
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,070
of a stolen SUV near the
Miami International Airport

192
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,270
was in fact a foiled terrorist attack.

193
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,020
Miami police working with
both Homeland Security

194
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,600
and the NSA have reported
that a suspect whose identity

195
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,760
has not been released
was killed in the attack.

196
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,703
Other details are expected to
emerge as authorities continue

197
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:34,373
to collect evidence at the crime scene.

198
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:39,330
- I've gone crazy and this is insanity,

199
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,591
tightening its grip around my
brain, or it's a brain tumor.

200
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:49,679
No, it's emotional, it's the,
after effects of a traumatic

201
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,723
stress related emotionally
induced hallucination.

202
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,227
Or you're dead.

203
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:00,524
Is that this is, am I dead?

204
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:07,785
Nope. I'm alive.

205
00:14:10,753 --> 00:14:12,384
Dane, open up.

206
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:16,670
This is your landlord, you're
two month behind on your rent.

207
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,083
I know you're in there,

208
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,117
I hear you talking to
yourself being a weirdo.

209
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:22,682
You been duckin' me for
two weeks you little shit--

210
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:26,520
...may have
been a man named Tomas Hawks,

211
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,628
a former government scientist
who also may be part of--

212
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:31,253
I can hear you moving around

213
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:33,636
if you don't open up,
I'm gonna unlock the door

214
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:36,156
and I'm coming inside.

215
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,590
Kate Dalton to the office,

216
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,323
Kate Dalton to the office.

217
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,680
Kate, I'm so glad you
finally decided to join us.

218
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,140
- I'm sorry.

219
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,400
- This is the second time
you've been late this week.

220
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,940
- I'm really sorry. My dog Roscoe was sick

221
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,070
and I had to take him to the vet

222
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,980
and today was the only
time they could see him.

223
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,230
- Sure sure, use whatever
excuse you'd like.

224
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,380
Regardless, Val-Mart
policy against tardiness

225
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,380
is very strict, one more write-up
and you'll be terminated.

226
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,300
- But I really can't
afford to lose this job.

227
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,630
- I know, but it's sick dog or no job.

228
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,230
I'd dump the dog and find yourself a guy

229
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,920
so you can afford to be late.

230
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,760
- That's pretty cold Mr. McGuire.

231
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,870
- Don't worry, I'm sure
Prince Charming is going to

232
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,323
just drop out of thin air
and just whisk you away.

233
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,888
- Hi!

234
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:00,055
- Who are you?

235
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,544
- Where that little shit go?

236
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:37,826
- What just happened?

237
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:40,587
- I don't know how to explain
in science terms, but--

238
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,666
- No, stay away from me!

239
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:50,740
- Please stop. My landlord is
gonna hear you, here just--

240
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,740
sit, please, no one's gonna hurt you,

241
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,486
you're not in any danger
just please don't freak out.

242
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:05,319
Okay?

243
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,320
- What is happening?

244
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,883
Where am I?

245
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:20,530
- Well, this is my apartment,
It's little, you know.

246
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:24,070
- We are in a city.
- New York.

247
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,820
- I was just in Arizona.

248
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,770
- What's your name?

249
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,190
- Kate.

250
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,732
- Hi Kate, I'm Dane it's nice to--

251
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,865
- Perfect.

252
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:49,936
- That's bad.

253
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,792
I should have guessed.

254
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,150
- What?

255
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,030
- Your, ah... name.

256
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,450
- Oh, yeah.
Right.

257
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,175
Okay, look. You seem like
a nice guy or whatever

258
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,719
and I'm really trying to hold it together

259
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:15,420
but I'm also very close
to losing my shit again.

260
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,300
So please, what is this?

261
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,369
- I know,
right?

262
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:21,919
That is exactly how I felt.

263
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:27,894
That thing. That, takes
a person from one place

264
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:31,220
into another place, it
took me from Miami to here

265
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,502
and then here to you, and
then brought you back here...

266
00:18:34,502 --> 00:18:35,618
...with me.

267
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:38,714
- Are you like a crazy person?

268
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,673
- Were you not just with me a
few seconds ago in Val-Mart?

269
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,808
- I was.

270
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:48,345
- Did you close your eyes
during the whole teleportation

271
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:51,910
through space bit, no, I bet
that you probably missed it

272
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,840
cause you had your eyes closed.

273
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,610
- No.
Okay, I get it.

274
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,420
I get that I was someplace
else, and now I'm here.

275
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,373
But teleportation, it isn't real.

276
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,140
- Well, I mean, yeah,
I would like normally

277
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,080
a hundred percent agree with
you but I'm going to say

278
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,583
based on the last two times
that I've done it, maybe it is.

279
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:16,160
- How? Did you make this thing?

280
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,870
- No, no, I did not make that.

281
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,220
I was in Miami and I was being carjacked,

282
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,610
and this guy had this thing
on him and I touched it

283
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,103
and thought of home and then, here I am.

284
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,300
- Wait, so if you just think
of where you want to go,

285
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,650
this thing takes you there?

286
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,843
- I guess, yeah.

287
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,900
- How'd you end up at the store?

288
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,730
- See, I don't know, that
doesn't make any sense.

289
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,563
I'd never even been there before.

290
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:49,300
- Well can it get me home?

291
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,590
Can I use it?
- Yeah, I think.

292
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,440
I mean, it should be able to...

293
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,480
...then again, we could wind
up on the moon for all I know.

294
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,467
- You look good.

295
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:20,613
- I've been in solitary
the past five years.

296
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,310
- What a surprise...

297
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,060
- What do you want Sy?

298
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,600
- You know for a man who
just got released from

299
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,960
three consecutive life sentences
in a Supermax prison...

300
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,930
you're pretty grumpy.

301
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,553
- It's my natural state.

302
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,630
- I need you to get something done for me.

303
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,580
I cashed in a lot of chips to get you out.

304
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,355
I need that object.

305
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,170
- What the hell is it?
It looks like a toy.

306
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,670
No, that's my way out.

307
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,190
- You get me that thing,
I'll let you disappear.

308
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,023
- Black Op?

309
00:21:58,023 --> 00:22:00,440
- My Op.
Talk to me only.

310
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,600
- Any leads?

311
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,750
- There was a magnetic
surge in New York yesterday

312
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,267
and one today in Arizona.

313
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,076
- Do I get my toys back?

314
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,493
- You give me that thing,

315
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,790
it's going to be Christmas morning.

316
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,260
Focus on where
you live, think about

317
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,370
what it looks like, see it?

318
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,203
Yes.

319
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:26,036
Do you see it?

320
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:26,869
Yes, I already said I did.

321
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:28,040
- Okay, sorry, he just
asked me the same thing

322
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,873
a bunch of times so I don't know.

323
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:30,220
- It's okay.

324
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,920
- All right, so now just
put your hands on it,

325
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,350
do that and just hold my hand.

326
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,183
- What?
Why?

327
00:22:35,183 --> 00:22:37,726
- So I can go with you--
or, so I can go with you

328
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:41,201
so I can take the device back with me.

329
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:42,034
- Okay.

330
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:43,730
- What did you think I meant?
- Nothing.

331
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,563
- What?

332
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,730
- Nothing, just shut up
and give me your hand.

333
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,180
Am I supposed to say something?

334
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,200
- Like Beam Me Up?

335
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,250
I don't know, I've never
had to un-hostage myself

336
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,540
from future technology.

337
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,430
I don't now what the rules are.

338
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:00,380
- Okay, just relax,
remember where you were.

339
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,885
Imagine yourself there.

340
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:06,685
Are you still thinking about it?

341
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,143
- Yes.

342
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:09,610
Are you positive this is how it works?

343
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,840
- No, I have no idea how it works either,

344
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,940
I just know that the guy who made it

345
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,055
"Wizard Of Ozzed" me here by telling me,

346
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:19,596
to "think about home," with
a pellet gun to my head.

347
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:23,383
- Okay, so, maybe it's
like not intense enough?

348
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,730
- We were in a car crash
and there were people

349
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,540
shooting real bullets at us too.

350
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,590
- Okay, I cross the line at, pellet guns.

351
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,840
- You know, maybe it's
broken, like from the fall

352
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,350
whatever, Maybe it just stopped working.

353
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,050
- So I'm just stuck here then?

354
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,760
I'm 3000 miles away from
home, my phone is destroyed

355
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,720
and all I have in my pocket
is a $20 bill and a dog treat.

356
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,553
- Okay, I'm sorry.

357
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:46,031
Most of my finances are
tied up at the moment.

358
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,060
Credit Card?

359
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,120
- Maxed.
- Me too.

360
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,890
Maybe you could call
someone and borrow money?

361
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,690
- No, there isn't anyone.

362
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,233
- Okay, okay.
We'll, we'll figure this out.

363
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:02,593
- I'm literally stuck here.
What am I supposed to do?

364
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:05,670
Go steal a car and drive home.

365
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,620
- What?
That is so funny.

366
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,580
No, we don't know how to steal a car.

367
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,863
- So what then?

368
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,260
- Well, my dad knew a guy,
he could fix almost anything.

369
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,700
He only lives a couple floors up.

370
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,030
We could take this to
him, maybe he can help.

371
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,810
- Hey?
Yeah, it's Kate.

372
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,570
I just wanted to check in on Roscoe.

373
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,613
What'd the doctor say?

374
00:24:30,613 --> 00:24:32,895
He's resting,
and still needs medication.

375
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:34,570
- How much is that gonna cost?

376
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,665
Not sure,
Probably over like $300.

377
00:24:36,665 --> 00:24:37,498
- Okay, uh...

378
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,929
Yeah, that's fine, just
have them go ahead then.

379
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:42,762
Okay.

380
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:45,120
- And can you please let him
outside as much as possible?

381
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,233
Sure, I'll do that.

382
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:47,066
- Yeah, he really likes that.

383
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:49,180
- Okay?
- Okay, great.

384
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,370
- Bye.
- Bye.

385
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,560
- Boyfriend at the hospital?

386
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,550
- Labrador Retriever at the vet.

387
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,650
Why would my boyfriend need to be let out?

388
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,870
- Good point.

389
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,860
- Is that what your
girlfriend does for you?

390
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,865
- No, I can't get one to let me in.

391
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,700
The team is getting closer.

392
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,550
They're attempting to triangulate
the source of the search.

393
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,780
- So this thing can be tracked.

394
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,261
Thank God, where's Sy?

395
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:21,680
- I don't know, he took the
jet after the team landed.

396
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,390
- Well stay on him, I want
to know everything he does.

397
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,980
You remember who's in charge.

398
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,750
- My loyalty has always
been to the company.

399
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,500
But Sy is Tier One special ops.

400
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,610
- I don't care what dark agency he runs,

401
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,583
you're a spy, spy on the man.

402
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,912
Keep me informed.

403
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,380
- Hawks torched his whole lab.

404
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,872
He put a drill press
through every hard drive.

405
00:25:44,872 --> 00:25:46,554
- Well if agent Graham's right Sy's

406
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:48,760
men should have the axcellerator soon.

407
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:53,960
Holy shit!
What is this?

408
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,210
It's kind of a long story.

409
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,480
- I just spent three and a
half hours in coach next to

410
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,430
a screaming baby, that was a long story.

411
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,420
- Yeah, We don't have time for ours.

412
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,360
- You left the funeral early.

413
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,990
Your aunt wanted to catch up kept saying

414
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,380
how much you look like your old man.

415
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,520
- That's what everyone says.

416
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,890
- I joked, you certainly
have his skill set.

417
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,390
- No, not really.

418
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,040
- What'd he do?

419
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,590
- Well, he and I--

420
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,620
- Let's rehash old
stories once we figure out

421
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,820
how to get this to work.

422
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,533
- First of all, I never
seen anything like this.

423
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,420
- What kind of car you
say you got this from?

424
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,170
- It doesn't come from a car Louie,

425
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,880
It's like, a scientist-made thing

426
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,880
that teleports human beings
from one place into another.

427
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,237
- Ah that's good.
That's funny.

428
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,720
- I'm not joking.

429
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,920
I can't figure out how to get it to work.

430
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,450
- He's telling the truth.

431
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,430
- Louie, remember how
my dad always said that

432
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,989
you could just look at something
and know how to fix it?

433
00:26:56,989 --> 00:27:00,604
I was kind of hoping that'd
be the case with this.

434
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:03,688
- Dane, I used to run an
auto body shop, Remember?

435
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,572
I don't know nothing
about something like this.

436
00:27:06,572 --> 00:27:08,320
If it is whatever you say

437
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,900
- It is, trust me.

438
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,678
- I do Dane you're family.

439
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,320
Where do you even get something like this?

440
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,560
- I'm telling you, the guy who made it,

441
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,549
after the funeral, I went, for
dad, kind of like a ceremony.

442
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:24,020
- I see.

443
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,950
- Wait, what ceremony?
Why are you talking in code?

444
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,910
- I Like her.

445
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,850
Where'd you guys meet?

446
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,068
- He took me hostage.

447
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,650
- What?
No, she's joking.

448
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,871
We met on a dating--
- Website.

449
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,680
- Look, Louie, there were
people after this guy

450
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,110
and he gave me this thing
and they were bad people.

451
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,520
They had guns, he was scared.

452
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,210
Could have been like government
or army, I don't know.

453
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,930
- Excuse me.

454
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,728
You seem to have left out
those important details

455
00:27:54,728 --> 00:27:56,730
when you told me this earlier.

456
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,563
- Sorry.

457
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,613
- Dane, I don't know what
this is or where it's from.

458
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,750
But, if it doesn't belong to you,

459
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,300
then it belongs to someone else.

460
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,650
And, like any boosted car,
when someone has property

461
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,360
that doesn't belong to 'em, the person

462
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,596
who it does belong to is
out there looking for it.

463
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,870
- Unfortunately, as a
matter of Val-Mart policy,

464
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,100
I cannot discuss employee
issues with an outside party.

465
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,200
But, anyway, I've already reported this

466
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,880
to the proper authorities.

467
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,590
- No, you didn't.

468
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,670
Matter of fact, you're
not sure what you saw.

469
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,470
The others told me that her name was Kate.

470
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,450
Now, I could find out
the rest from your files.

471
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,020
- Sir,
did you pay for that?

472
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,340
- Not yet, I need to
know where this Kate is.

473
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,870
- I can't help you.

474
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,340
And who are you again?
Do you have a badge?

475
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,320
- Mr. McGuire...

476
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,740
You don't even require a
background check with this item.

477
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,223
I don't know what agency you're with,

478
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,323
but I can't stand people like you.

479
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,540
- People like me

480
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,430
- Opening things before you pay for them

481
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:20,000
and disassembling them, like
the rules don't apply to you.

482
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,380
Like you're special or something,

483
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,460
because you're an officer of the law?

484
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,990
Well, it's shoplifting really

485
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,560
- Funny, though.

486
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,920
- It's disgusting.

487
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,490
- This thing is as deadly as any firearm

488
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,323
- Oh wait--

489
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,883
- Shouldn't of lied to me, Mr. McGuire.

490
00:29:43,052 --> 00:29:44,360
- You're like a son Dane,

491
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,330
I wish I could do more
to help you, I really do.

492
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,163
- I know.

493
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,540
Thanks Louie, I really
appreciate you trying.

494
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,373
- Anytime.

495
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,812
Don't hesitate to reach
out, you know that.

496
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,316
- That's a nice girl
you wound up with too.

497
00:29:59,316 --> 00:30:00,670
- No, no we're--

498
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,840
- We're just traveling companions

499
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,240
on the great teleportation
highway for now.

500
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,490
- Hope that works out.

501
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,840
- Hey, do you happen to
have that old Mustang?

502
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,940
- Told you I sold it last month.

503
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,739
Gotta pay the rent.
I got a used Prius.

504
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:20,969
- Please tell me that's a joke.

505
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:22,030
- Times change.

506
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,841
- Everything all right?

507
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,090
- Exactly how attached
are you to that Prius?

508
00:30:46,851 --> 00:30:49,118
Hey what happened back there?

509
00:30:49,118 --> 00:30:51,664
- I got a message, people are
coming here, after this thing.

510
00:30:51,664 --> 00:30:52,900
- From who?
- I don't know.

511
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,726
- Are we supposed to trust that?

512
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:59,033
- I don't think we have
much of a choice, come on.

513
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:19,399
- Go!

514
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:43,600
- You have your seat belt on?

515
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,433
- Yeah.

516
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:45,756
- Lets hope these things
are tougher than they look.

517
00:31:45,756 --> 00:31:46,589
- Why?

518
00:31:52,487 --> 00:31:53,495
- Who is this now?

519
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,794
- I don't know, but I think they're

520
00:31:54,794 --> 00:31:56,528
related to the guys with guns.

521
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:11,250
- What are you doing?
- Relaxation breathing.

522
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,083
- Are you okay?

523
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,818
- No, I'm not okay!

524
00:32:15,818 --> 00:32:18,523
I wasn't expecting a high
speed car chase so quickly.

525
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,393
Or ever!

526
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,884
- I get it, I mean,
it's only my second one.

527
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:26,150
In a very short period of time,

528
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,203
but I promise we're gonna be okay.

529
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,840
You keep driving like
this, you're gonna kill us.

530
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,673
- Okay, okay.

531
00:32:47,673 --> 00:32:48,860
Keep doing the breathing thing.

532
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,685
Shit!
That was a nice car.

533
00:33:21,127 --> 00:33:22,460
- What the hell?

534
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,633
- I hope Louie has
insurance on this thing.

535
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:39,350
- This is madness.

536
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,002
- We're getting great gas mileage though.

537
00:33:47,311 --> 00:33:48,949
- It's the police!

538
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,783
We're going to jail.

539
00:33:51,783 --> 00:33:53,821
Nope. Been there, done that, not again.

540
00:33:53,821 --> 00:33:54,654
- What?

541
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,480
What were you in jail for?

542
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:02,606
- Did I actually say that out loud?

543
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:03,856
- Yes, you did.

544
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,739
We should just surrender.

545
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:09,489
- Not today things are too weird.

546
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,060
we got to find a different car.

547
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,280
We need one that's um--

548
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,250
- Not covered in bullet holes?

549
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,882
Like a bullet hole filled piece

550
00:34:39,882 --> 00:34:41,765
of Swiss cheese made out of a car?

551
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,866
- Are you okay?

552
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,168
- Am I okay?

553
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,670
No I'm great.
Just great.

554
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,000
I mean, before this my only
concern was having to deal with

555
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,600
a customer with too many
items in express checkout.

556
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,120
And now it's trying to find
a replacement getaway car

557
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,020
post high speed chase after
being shot at by a helicopter.

558
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,540
- We need to find another car,

559
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,888
a fast, supercharged, bulletproof car.

560
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,990
- Well you sure did pick
a hell of a replacement.

561
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,732
- It was the best available option.

562
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:18,060
A lot of new models
have electronic alarms,

563
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:18,970
computers on board.

564
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,670
And besides I mean it's not too flashy

565
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,680
and we won't draw attention to ourselves.

566
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,431
- Especially if we end up at
a convention for soccer moms.

567
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,153
- What?

568
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,960
- How'd you know how to do this?

569
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,440
- Do what?

570
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,930
- Oh I don't know the whole real life

571
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,860
Grand Theft Auto simulation.

572
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,660
How did you in a matter of seconds

573
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,090
professionally steal a car?

574
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,310
- I wouldn't say it was professional

575
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,540
it's more in a panic necessity, You know?

576
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,810
- Cut the bullshit,
just tell me the truth.

577
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,563
- Okay,
fine, fine.

578
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,700
My dad was like one of the
best car thieves, ever.

579
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,523
- Now, you steal cars?

580
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,486
- No.
Now I deliver pizza.

581
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,083
I left Miami, had to get out of that life

582
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,564
I moved to New York, and
Louie, he knew my dad.

583
00:36:14,564 --> 00:36:15,664
They were old friends.

584
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,120
He hired me and I worked at

585
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,650
auto body shop with him until he retired.

586
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:24,850
Louie is more like a father
to me that my real one.

587
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,563
- Sweet guy.

588
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,860
- Yeah, Louie is actually the one

589
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,286
who convinced me to go to the funeral.

590
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,393
I hadn't seen my dad in years.

591
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,190
And he got shot boosting someone's SUV

592
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,930
and I thought as a kind of tribute,

593
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,693
whatever that I'd, finish the job.

594
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,700
But as I was stealing it,
someone points a gun at me,

595
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,564
shows me a device.

596
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:55,840
- And you transported through
space from a car in Miami

597
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,420
and into your apartment in New York?

598
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,470
- Bingo.

599
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:03,127
- I mean really still sounds
so insane to say it out loud.

600
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,050
- I know the whole,
stealing thing is stupid.

601
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:11,548
It just made me not feel as lost as usual.

602
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,798
- Maybe I should try it.

603
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:28,422
- What do you want?

604
00:37:29,641 --> 00:37:31,478
- That's a sweet ride.

605
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,745
Hey, hey.

606
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,480
I wouldn't blame yourself on
the hiding spot, it happens.

607
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,110
Where do you think Dane would
go after he dumped your car?

608
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,070
You think Kate stuck with him?

609
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,360
- Who are you?

610
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,390
- I've been thinking about that a lot.

611
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,820
Of course you're not asking
the philosophical sense,

612
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,450
are you?

613
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,257
Where are they Louie?

614
00:37:57,257 --> 00:37:58,507
- Why do you wanna know?

615
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,697
- I really don't have time
for games, it might be best if

616
00:38:14,697 --> 00:38:17,980
you just answer the questions.

617
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:22,263
But then again, I'm always
up for a little fun.

618
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:25,260
- I told the police and
those Feds everything.

619
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,913
I swear I don't know
anything please, I swear.

620
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,912
- You sure you're not lying to me?

621
00:38:31,912 --> 00:38:33,623
- No, I told them everything.

622
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,535
- I believe you,
I do.

623
00:38:37,535 --> 00:38:38,368
Yeah.

624
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,030
Really, that's it.

625
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,750
No excitement?
My God!

626
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,550
I mean, you just
converted me to a believer

627
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,674
and you're not even happy
with your accomplishment.

628
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,570
Yeah,
breathe, breathe.

629
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,407
Let it go, let it go brother.

630
00:38:58,407 --> 00:39:01,750
That's my fault, it's just
habit, you know symmetry.

631
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,940
But I think it's better this way.

632
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,570
Balance of pain, spread it out a bit.

633
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,483
- Screw you, asshole.

634
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,630
- I'm trying to help you Louie,

635
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,460
I am trying to help you here.

636
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,460
- The hell with you!

637
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,000
- I understand, I understand your anger.

638
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,840
I relate to you.
- You're crazy.

639
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,663
- True enough, that I
am, I'm gonna let you go.

640
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,403
If you could help me with
one more thing I need.

641
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,613
I want you to look like
you've been shot in the head.

642
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,120
Now you're free, Louie.

643
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,100
- With all the construction
going on around here,

644
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,450
this is where they put you?

645
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,060
- You should be in New
York, cleaning up your mess.

646
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,850
- I had a meeting in town with a senator.

647
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:04,900
- Glad you got the time.

648
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,740
- Well, my team's on the site.

649
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,010
The owner of the car said
the vehicle was stolen.

650
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,710
- You used an assault helicopter.

651
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,950
- which tracks, because we
traced the source of the surge

652
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,910
to an apartment owned by a millennial--

653
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,730
- Automatic weapon fire on public streets.

654
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,490
- You should get back in the field, Ray,

655
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,470
shit happens, We're cleaning it up.

656
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,450
And I thought I'd bring
you a kind of an apology,

657
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,076
it's a very fine bourbon,
it's rather expensive.

658
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,290
- Do you buy it by the case?

659
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,370
- Actually I do, I find that it helps

660
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,680
grease the rails of
inter-agency cooperation.

661
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,122
- You wanna taste?

662
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:44,072
- No actually I'd rather have a scotch.

663
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,790
- so you gonna tell me about this kid?

664
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:55,420
- Car thief, pizza delivery
guy, a loser, We'll get him.

665
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,684
- So other than the senator,

666
00:40:57,684 --> 00:40:58,770
what are you doing here?

667
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,318
- Well, I wanted to talk
to you about Thomas Hawks.

668
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,960
- ...Romans bearing gifts.

669
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,160
- I don't understand why you're getting

670
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,940
in the way with me on
this, I'm playing nice.

671
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,990
But, you know, I don't have to

672
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,400
we don't serve the same masters.

673
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,400
- Sy, Hawks came to us
before he went to you.

674
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,740
He saw through you, discovered
what you planned for it.

675
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,258
So he runs, he doesn't trust anyone.

676
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,830
Now, we have a gigantic mess because,

677
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,036
neither of us could get him to prevent it.

678
00:41:35,036 --> 00:41:36,480
- You know that's quite the story.

679
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,481
I mean, the way you tell it,

680
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:42,290
and it almost sounds like,
you're the "nice guy".

681
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,150
- So you're "goody two
shoes" in this situation?

682
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,420
- No, no, it's just that I
realized a long time ago,

683
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,580
they're no such things as "good guys".

684
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,040
I'm the smart one, a patriot.

685
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,070
This device is safeguard,

686
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:02,245
and incredible power to
breach and extract anything.

687
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:05,481
- There are too many variables.

688
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:09,070
This thing should have
been destroyed immediately

689
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,960
never even considered for funding.

690
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,560
- You know I remembered you
as being a lot more fun.

691
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,767
- We will wipe it out, all
evidence of it, everything.

692
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,442
- You sure about that?

693
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,900
Do you believe that's the best solution?

694
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,500
- It is the only solution.

695
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,835
- Thanks for the drink.

696
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:43,130
- Oh, one more thing. You
did bring Brink into this.

697
00:42:44,153 --> 00:42:46,530
You didn't think we'd find out?

698
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,510
- Actually, I don't care.

699
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,590
- You should, the man's sloppy,

700
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,360
landed commercially at
JFK a few hours ago.

701
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,060
He is supposed to be a ghost?

702
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,900
- He is a ghost, but he
makes public appearances

703
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,826
when the Devil's too busy

704
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:03,684
...or I ask him to.

705
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,250
- What do we think?

706
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,600
- Nothing new, he's fishing

707
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,330
If he had anything more, I
would have heard about it.

708
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,610
- Well, with Brink involved,
things are gonna get worse

709
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:18,930
before they get better.

710
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,793
- Maybe we will catch a break.

711
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,530
- Graham, what do you really think of him?

712
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,590
Sy?

713
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,490
- Yes.

714
00:43:28,627 --> 00:43:31,380
- Sy is a dangerous egomaniac

715
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,415
who will stop at nothing
to get the device.

716
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,200
So, how did it go?

717
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,830
- The man is a scared pacifist bureaucrat

718
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,588
in a dangerous world.

719
00:44:00,345 --> 00:44:01,336
- It's gone.

720
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,420
- How's that possible?

721
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,253
- I don't know.

722
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:07,130
Is that a thing,
self-erasing text messages?

723
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:08,140
- Let me see.

724
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,460
- Should I even have this
on, can't they track us?

725
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,180
- Uh, you ask me like I've
done this hundreds of times.

726
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,013
- I'm ditching the phone.

727
00:44:15,013 --> 00:44:19,370
- Wait, what if whoever that
was tries to contact you again?

728
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,210
- Okay, then just put it in airplane mode

729
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,410
and turn it off for now.

730
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,010
- I'm really starting to regret

731
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,810
being the teleporter's chosen one.

732
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,660
- It's okay, relax Kate.

733
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,033
Everything's under control, I got this.

734
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,530
- You could've checked the
gas before you stole it.

735
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,080
- Well, next time you steal
a car, you can do that.

736
00:44:48,612 --> 00:44:50,073
- Why am I HERE?

737
00:44:51,196 --> 00:44:52,370
- You know, I never thought about that.

738
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:53,860
- No, I'm just talking out loud.

739
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,950
- No I mean, really, why you?

740
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,390
Why did it take me to that place?

741
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,730
- Well, we'd be able to figure that out,

742
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,430
if the person who invented it wasn't dead.

743
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:04,298
- There's gotta be some
way to figure this out.

744
00:45:04,298 --> 00:45:06,340
- What are you doing?

745
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,331
- Google.

746
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,950
- Actually at this point, why not?

747
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,213
- Yeah, if they track
us, they track us but,

748
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,298
if we can use this thing
they won't be able to.

749
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:18,110
- Anything?

750
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,152
- I don't know, lot's of
stuff about "Star Trek".

751
00:45:21,254 --> 00:45:23,610
I just got a text; 'beware
of the blonde in black'.

752
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,443
What is this?

753
00:45:24,443 --> 00:45:26,554
- Dane, they're totally
tracking your phone.

754
00:45:26,554 --> 00:45:27,387
Ooh shit!

755
00:45:27,387 --> 00:45:28,470
- Go, go, go!

756
00:45:36,892 --> 00:45:38,725
- We want that device!

757
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:48,210
- Oh, my God!
We totally did it.

758
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,290
- Hell yeah, we did!

759
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,990
- Okay, we're only in a parking lot.

760
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,857
- No, I think we're gonna be okay.

761
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,183
- UTAH?

762
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,190
- We can do this, I'm
not that far from home.

763
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,220
- Yeah, we just need
to find out how to get

764
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,600
the rest of the way
without using this thing,

765
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,900
it's completely random
that it brought us here.

766
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,015
- Isn't this like a goldmine
for you or something?

767
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,886
- Any requests?

768
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,753
- Shut it off before you toss it.

769
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,670
- I broke yours, so you
should do the honors.

770
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,400
- I guess that's it for
perfectly timed mystery texts.

771
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,560
- Does this Jeep have a GPS or anything?

772
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,180
- No but, you make a good
point, we should do our best to

773
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,190
stay off the grid until we're
ready to make our next move.

774
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:17,164
- Yeah,
what is our next move?

775
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:19,970
- Well we have the device,
they show up we'll use it

776
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:23,351
to zap from wherever we are
to wherever it takes us.

777
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:24,790
- Is that really your plan?

778
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,120
We're just supposed to
randomly zap around?

779
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,410
- Only as last resort, I don't think

780
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,100
we should we zapping anymore either.

781
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,396
- Why?

782
00:48:31,396 --> 00:48:33,846
- I think they're able to
track that somehow too.

783
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,593
- Whoa, whoa!
Careful!

784
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,103
Are you planning on
driving us off this cliff?

785
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:47,513
- This is amazing.

786
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,800
Never been in the Grand Canyon before.

787
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,693
- Me either, it's beautiful.

788
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,870
- So if you could zap
anywhere in the world,

789
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,020
where would you zap to?

790
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,473
- Fifth grade.

791
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,785
- That's time travel
dummy that doesn't count.

792
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:15,830
- Oh, yeah, right.

793
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,880
I'd say Hawaii?
- Lame.

794
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,713
- What?

795
00:49:21,713 --> 00:49:23,440
- I'm sure everyone would say Hawaii.

796
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,000
- Okay, so then where would you zap to

797
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,623
if you could just zap anywhere?

798
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,393
- Not so sure, I'm not
doing that right now.

799
00:49:35,101 --> 00:49:36,318
- It's getting dark

800
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,260
even if we could make
it back to your place

801
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,350
in Arizona by tomorrow, They
could be waiting for us.

802
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:45,530
- Did you see all the
camping gear back there?

803
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,230
I mean, maybe we should just
camp somewhere for the night,

804
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,113
somewhere safe and off the grid.

805
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,303
- That's actually kind of perfect.

806
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:05,810
- So let's get this straight
Sy, with all your resources,

807
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,670
plus the psycho you thought
to include, the pizza boy

808
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,250
and the checkout girl have
eluded you once again.

809
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,510
- Ray, Come on, I've been
trying to explain to you

810
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:21,120
we will get the device, but
all you're complaining about is

811
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,910
collateral damage while I'm
attempting to have my team

812
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,120
act with restraint, even Brink.

813
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,260
- Cut the bullshit Sy,

814
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,530
Where do we stand right now?

815
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,590
- The teams are on their way

816
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:36,240
to the site of the latest surge in Utah.

817
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,520
Their cell phone signal
went dead in approximately

818
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,870
the same location, we believe
that they teleported there

819
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:44,890
and we're not even sure if they understand

820
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:46,850
how the axcellerator works.

821
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,470
- Nobody understands how it
works and you certainly don't,

822
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,060
you don't even get how
dangerous this thing is

823
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,650
in the right hands, if we controlled it,

824
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:57,272
under the best circumstances.

825
00:50:57,272 --> 00:50:59,159
- Oh I understand.

826
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:04,159
- No, no, you don't,
that's it Sy, You're done.

827
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,660
- Pull your people, I'm sending ours in.

828
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:12,660
This has become a
certified disaster.

829
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,370
- My people are on their way.

830
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:19,411
It's more efficient if they
follow through at this point.

831
00:51:20,627 --> 00:51:25,180
- You blew it Sy, that's
why I'm getting in your way.

832
00:51:26,855 --> 00:51:30,730
Because, I am not gonna risk civilization

833
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:33,337
with this thing falling
into the wrong hands.

834
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:38,484
Namely yours!

835
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,580
- Are you okay, Ray?

836
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:43,530
- Jesus!

837
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,313
- You sound all, worked up?

838
00:51:47,578 --> 00:51:51,303
- You treacherous son of a bitch...

839
00:51:56,407 --> 00:51:59,340
- You should really go
easy on that hard stuff,

840
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:02,943
my friend... it's a killer.

841
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,876
You know that man, he
can't hold his liquor.

842
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,413
- What was in that bottle?

843
00:52:18,413 --> 00:52:22,770
Odorless, colorless,
tasteless, and untraceable.

844
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:25,383
Waste of a good bottle of bourbon really.

845
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,050
- Why aren't you on a plane to Utah?

846
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,790
- I have no idea where the device is,

847
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:33,466
but I know where it's going to be.

848
00:52:33,466 --> 00:52:34,330
- Really?

849
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:38,600
- Really, I'll need Graham
to call her media friends.

850
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:51,740
- Look what I found!

851
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,930
- Excellent, give me one.

852
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:54,763
- Wait a second, let's see what we got.

853
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:59,453
Beef Stroganoff with
noodles, breakfast skillet,

854
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,453
beef jerky?

855
00:53:04,453 --> 00:53:05,850
- Ooo, an appetizer, perfect.

856
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,200
- This feels so surreal after
what we've been through.

857
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,460
Somehow camping in the
middle of the desert

858
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:21,040
with a stolen car, it almost feels normal.

859
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,060
- Yeah, it feels good,
Right?

860
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,043
- Right.

861
00:53:25,738 --> 00:53:30,064
- So, besides the fact
that you work at Val-Mart.

862
00:53:30,064 --> 00:53:31,670
- Worked at Val-Mart.

863
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,250
- Your dog is at the vet.

864
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,170
- My best friend.

865
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,310
- And you're from Arizona.

866
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:37,143
- Unfortunately.

867
00:53:38,021 --> 00:53:39,187
- What you do?

868
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,833
- I have no idea what I want
to do or, what I'm doing.

869
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,790
- Yeah, I can certainly relate to that.

870
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:53,490
- After I went to Arizona
State, I couldn't get a job,

871
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:56,323
I was buried in student loans.

872
00:53:56,323 --> 00:53:59,069
And my parents can't even
afford the trailer they live in

873
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,560
so, I just had to take
whatever job I could.

874
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,660
- What was your major?

875
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,258
- Art history.

876
00:54:09,075 --> 00:54:12,730
- I'm sorry, yeah,

877
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:17,730
cause, that's really good
training for, not any career.

878
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,570
- Yeah, now they tell me.

879
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,060
- Don't be too hard on yourself,
all I do is deliver pizza.

880
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,162
- Following in the family business

881
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:27,912
would've been a bad option I guess.

882
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,730
- And I'm just now realizing that

883
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,923
I'm officially late for work... again.

884
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,935
- Well, now we're both unemployed.

885
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,170
- To unemployment.

886
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:43,930
- Better than bowing down to the man.

887
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,330
- More time for video games.

888
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:50,064
- It's funny, right?

889
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:54,303
Two of us somehow finding each other.

890
00:54:57,305 --> 00:55:01,007
- All of a sudden being lost
but in ways we never expected.

891
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:17,350
It's amazing how they all look the same.

892
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,550
What time do they open?

893
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:19,930
- They're always open.

894
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,350
- What's the plan exactly?

895
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,240
- Dane!
I got this.

896
00:55:24,174 --> 00:55:26,293
- Shit, this is gonna be good.

897
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,770
- So my stupid boyfriend
decides to buy a TV

898
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,800
that doesn't even fit into our apartment.

899
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,350
- Well, the Val-Mart return
policy on electronics

900
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:04,050
is only 15 days and you
need a valid sales receipt.

901
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:07,253
- Really?
Let me see if I have it.

902
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,233
Thank God!

903
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,630
- Do you want this back
on your credit card?

904
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:16,460
- No, actually I left
my credit card at home,

905
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,960
but if I can just do a cash
refund that would be great.

906
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:22,910
As many in the country
begin to think twice about

907
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,720
their own personal internet security,

908
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,230
New York City and federal
authorities continue to believe

909
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:29,950
the torture and execution
of New Yorker Louis Moretti

910
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,200
was the work of internet
killers Dane Holloway

911
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,840
and his girlfriend Kate Dalton.

912
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,650
Holloway and Dalton
photographed the victim

913
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,550
after shooting him multiple times

914
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:39,358
and posted it on social
media with a warning

915
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:41,260
that more murders would follow.

916
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,930
Particularly chilling
was the way Mr. Holloway

917
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,920
lured Louis Moretti by using social media.

918
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,780
The motive for the brutal
killing is still unknown.

919
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,490
Holloway and Dalton
escaped from authorities

920
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,430
in a destructive high speed chase.

921
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,420
Unconfirmed reports place them on the run

922
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,670
to Utah or Arizona where
Miss Dalton had resided.

923
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,230
If seen use extreme caution,

924
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:00,733
do not approach and contact
authorities immediately.

925
00:57:00,733 --> 00:57:04,170
The two are considered to be
armed and highly dangerous--

926
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,003
- Dane wait!

927
00:57:05,003 --> 00:57:06,850
- Louie was the only person I had left.

928
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,470
- I'm sorry.
- I'm going back.

929
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,060
- You have to calm down,
you can't just go back there

930
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,730
without a plan or because you're upset.

931
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:13,640
- What difference does that make?

932
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,950
The whole country's after us now.

933
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:15,830
- Yes, but let's just think for a second--

934
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:17,348
- They killed Louis!

935
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,116
- I'm really sorry.

936
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,870
- We can't hide in the desert forever.

937
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,771
- Yes but let's make the smart move here.

938
00:57:25,771 --> 00:57:29,540
- They just made it
for me, I'm going back.

939
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,160
- God this is crazy.

940
00:57:32,745 --> 00:57:34,120
- Are you coming or not?

941
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,229
I'll see you around.

942
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,581
Thank you.

943
00:57:46,856 --> 00:57:49,751
- We're in this together.

944
00:57:49,751 --> 00:57:50,709
- Oh no!

945
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:53,114
- Wait, isn't this?

946
00:57:53,114 --> 00:57:55,410
- Louis apartment.
They wanted us to come here.

947
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:58,280
- Okay love birds,
looks like someone heard

948
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,730
what I did to their friend
and they're not happy.

949
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:03,853
- Oh my goodness!

950
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:16,473
- Oh God!
No get away from me!

951
00:58:16,473 --> 00:58:18,698
No stop, get away from me,
please!

952
00:58:23,787 --> 00:58:26,654
- Come on Dane, whatta ya say, huh?!

953
00:58:26,654 --> 00:58:28,003
Come here.

954
00:58:28,003 --> 00:58:30,079
Oh yes, look at that, little precious!

955
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:44,135
Gotcha!

956
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:49,567
- Goodbye asshole.

957
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,660
- You might as well give that to me.

958
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:55,523
We've got your girl and she's
long gone to Iron Mountain.

959
00:58:56,989 --> 00:58:57,822
- ...It's what they want!...

960
00:58:57,822 --> 00:58:58,655
- ...We're in this together...

961
00:58:58,655 --> 00:58:59,488
- ...I'm going back...

962
00:58:59,488 --> 00:59:01,466
- ...long gone to Iron Mountain...

963
00:59:01,466 --> 00:59:02,299
- ...You just have to trust me...

964
00:59:02,299 --> 00:59:03,132
- ...We're in this together...

965
00:59:03,132 --> 00:59:04,090
- ...I'm going back...

966
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:05,180
- ...Do you wish you were there?...

967
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,095
- ...to Iron Mountain...

968
00:59:06,095 --> 00:59:06,945
- ...We're in this together...

969
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,880
- I should have told you,
be in motion on your feet

970
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,060
before takeoff, it helps with the landing.

971
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,310
- What is this?

972
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:28,260
- I know it must be confusing.

973
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,143
- Confusing?

974
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,340
What the hell is happening?

975
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,490
- You seem more high
strung than I remember.

976
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,070
- Don't worry you're not dead.

977
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,730
- I'm not worried that
I'm dead you're dead.

978
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,570
That's what worries me.

979
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:47,379
- That would worry me too
if that were the case.

980
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,170
- Watch your head.

981
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,090
- It is the case, you died.

982
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,283
The SUV exploded, it
was all over the news.

983
00:59:55,298 --> 00:59:58,560
- Yes, the SUV did explode
and had I stayed inside,

984
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,280
I most certainly would have
died but, by some mistake,

985
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,600
some portal opening,
teleportation error of the gods

986
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,440
so to speak, I was thrown

987
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,883
into the backyard of my childhood home.

988
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,090
- What?

989
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:14,980
- It may have been
residual psykinetic energy.

990
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,853
I'm not certain.

991
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,330
- Why didn't you try and find me?

992
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:24,490
People have been trying to
kill me for the last two days.

993
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:28,140
- Well, there is only one
axcellerator and a prototype

994
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:31,000
at that, besides you and that girl

995
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,800
have been surging so frequently

996
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,250
it's been hard to get a signal.

997
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,527
- Kate, her name is Kate and you know,

998
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:38,220
she thought that this would...

999
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,760
Kate!
They took...

1000
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,133
Iron Mountain.

1001
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:45,803
- What did you say--

1002
01:00:45,803 --> 01:00:47,030
- Iron Mountain, they have her, Kate.

1003
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,380
They took her to whatever that is,

1004
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,213
do you know it?

1005
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:51,920
- Yes, Sy knows it as well.

1006
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,443
It's in Santiago, Chile.

1007
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,193
- Chile?

1008
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,290
Why would they take her there?

1009
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,930
- It's the mountain, the physical makeup,

1010
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:06,110
the iron core components
that make up it's center...

1011
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,660
It affects the axcellerator,
it'll never work.

1012
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,620
- Can we use it to get there though?

1013
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,449
- Well, could be possible
but, you broke it.

1014
01:01:14,449 --> 01:01:17,350
- You should have made it
like a suit or something.

1015
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:20,353
- Well, thanks for the design
input I'll keep that in mind.

1016
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,690
- Look, we have to get
there and save Kate.

1017
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:27,660
- Sy has a substantial
armed black ops team

1018
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,650
under his control.

1019
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:32,953
If he goes to Iron Mountain,
it's likely he's expecting us.

1020
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,840
- Was it you sending me those disappearing

1021
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,973
text messages helping us escape?

1022
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,540
- Text messages?

1023
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:41,590
- Those came from me.

1024
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,030
- Who are you?

1025
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:49,020
How did you find this place?

1026
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,550
- I can find most anything I want.

1027
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,110
- Who are you?

1028
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,750
- My name is Amanda Graham.

1029
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:58,580
I'm a member of a private
global peacekeeping organization

1030
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:02,250
and not the United Nations,
they don't keep peace anywhere.

1031
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,940
You don't really need
to know more than that.

1032
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,440
- Because if we did, you'd
have to kill us, right?

1033
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:11,230
- We've been discreetly
monitoring the abilities

1034
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,840
of the axcellerator along with

1035
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,670
several government agencies
who are funding it.

1036
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:20,440
Sy wants the device for
war, greed, money, power.

1037
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,010
The NSA wants to destroy it.

1038
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,253
- What do you want?

1039
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,950
- I want to use it for
good to help this planet.

1040
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:31,660
But, now that Sy has gone
rogue, I want him also.

1041
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,230
- I just want help Kate.

1042
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:35,920
- Good, our interests may align.

1043
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,920
If you're prepared to go further.

1044
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,570
- How do I know we can trust you?

1045
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,900
- You're standing in a laboratory of a man

1046
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,630
you assumed was dead after
spending several days--

1047
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,230
- Teleporting from place to place

1048
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,370
blah, blah, I know I get it.

1049
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,280
- Good, then you'll understand that

1050
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,530
you can't trust anything.

1051
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,670
- She makes a good point.

1052
01:03:14,483 --> 01:03:17,290
Have you been to Chile, Kate?

1053
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:21,680
- Iron Mountain, it's
actually a lovely resort,

1054
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,093
good skiing, but not today.

1055
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:27,570
- Why bring me here?

1056
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,910
I have nothing to do with this.

1057
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,370
- You know Kate, I'm sorry.

1058
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:33,603
I have to apologize, I know
it's difficult being leverage.

1059
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:37,400
But, your boyfriend
Dane, he's going to bring

1060
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,340
the axcellerator to me because of you,

1061
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,283
then I'll be through with the both of you.

1062
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:47,440
- Do you enjoy being
such a sadistic asshole?

1063
01:03:51,687 --> 01:03:52,753
- Yes, I do.

1064
01:04:40,304 --> 01:04:43,263
- All right, our teams
are in place, on standby.

1065
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,290
- Everything ours,
power, telecom, wireless?

1066
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:49,970
- Everything.

1067
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,502
- What about the locals?

1068
01:04:51,502 --> 01:04:52,910
- Oh, that was the easy part,

1069
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:54,740
once you make your reservation,

1070
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,860
our team will clear the summit.

1071
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:59,070
- Well let's get this party started.

1072
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:00,243
- With pleasure.

1073
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:13,340
- Take a good look,
Kate, we're in the Andes.

1074
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:15,723
Nowhere to go even if you wanted to.

1075
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,530
- Okay Brink, make us a reservation,

1076
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:22,763
you know how I hate crowds.

1077
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:08,550
Everyone
evacuated, summit secured.

1078
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,600
Access slopes are secured.

1079
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:30,459
- Jesus!

1080
01:07:30,459 --> 01:07:32,290
- I didn't mean to invent this.

1081
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,630
- I'm not giving up without a fight.

1082
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:40,360
- Dane, I know you've survived thus far,

1083
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,990
and your instincts are excellent,

1084
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:43,810
but these are real killers, bad men

1085
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,680
especially Sy, you need
to stick to the plan.

1086
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,360
- He's got no reason not to
kill both of us regardless.

1087
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,430
- You give him the dummy device,

1088
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:53,763
you radio us that you've got
her and get out, understood?

1089
01:07:54,673 --> 01:07:55,750
- I didn't have anything to lose before

1090
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:59,540
but things have changed, understood.

1091
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:00,930
- What am I supposed to do?

1092
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:03,563
- You stay here with the real
device and get it working.

1093
01:08:04,729 --> 01:08:07,640
- You know what you're
big mistake was Kate?

1094
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,263
You should have stayed on
the run, but you came back.

1095
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:14,080
Why?

1096
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:18,160
- Because someone needed
me and I care about him.

1097
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,560
And I care about not acting like a coward

1098
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,310
or trying to control things like a coward.

1099
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:26,480
- You know something
Kate, with all your talk,

1100
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,963
all your mettle, if I placed
this right here, we'll see.

1101
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,930
You will shake like a
coward like everybody else.

1102
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:36,960
You shaking Kate? Sit up.

1103
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,010
Sir, the
gondola has been restarted

1104
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:40,690
and the kid is on board.

1105
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:41,723
- Of course.

1106
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:44,330
How you doing Dane?

1107
01:08:45,181 --> 01:08:47,540
I'm all right, a little nervous.

1108
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,217
- Well, that's understandable.

1109
01:08:49,217 --> 01:08:51,600
- Not about the whole hostage rescue thing

1110
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,490
or shadow agency criminals,
I'm just not really

1111
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:58,253
the biggest fan of heights.

1112
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,713
- This is not right.

1113
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:06,503
- We're gonna work to get you back down

1114
01:09:06,503 --> 01:09:08,587
as quickly and safely as possible.

1115
01:09:08,587 --> 01:09:10,087
- Much appreciated.

1116
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:15,710
Also, if there's any type of
monetary reward for you know,

1117
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:19,350
saving the world or keeping a
top secret experiment secret

1118
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:22,310
that too would be greatly appreciated.

1119
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:23,560
- I'll see what I can do.

1120
01:09:47,323 --> 01:09:51,656
- Sorry pal, he only gets
it when I get the girl.

1121
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,880
Hey, Kate.
- Dane!

1122
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:00,713
- Hello Dane.

1123
01:10:02,642 --> 01:10:07,360
- Kate is quite a
handful, is she worth it?

1124
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,260
I mean, after all you've been through?

1125
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,600
If I can speak, man to man.

1126
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,833
- You'd have to actually
be a man to do that.

1127
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:21,160
- Looks like two of you
are perfect for each other.

1128
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:21,993
- Let her go.

1129
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:25,430
- Hang on, how many people are with you?

1130
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,070
- No one.

1131
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:29,819
- Well, how did you find us?

1132
01:10:29,819 --> 01:10:31,170
- Because I can't use the device here

1133
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:32,520
because of the mountain.

1134
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,960
- You're smarter than I thought.

1135
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,890
- Yeah, quick Google
search on the mountain,

1136
01:10:41,890 --> 01:10:44,844
it's obvious why you would
have chosen this place.

1137
01:10:44,844 --> 01:10:46,894
...So I couldn't use
the device against you.

1138
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,250
It's common sense, really.

1139
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:54,410
- Well, maybe it's common sense
that at a certain altitude,

1140
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:56,620
let's say at the top of this mountain,

1141
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:59,800
in this very restaurant, far enough away

1142
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,233
from the mountain's
deposit that it might work.

1143
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,230
- Well, if I had known
that I could have saved

1144
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:10,792
a lot of the frequent flyer
miles I cashed in to get here.

1145
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,173
- Are we gonna do this?

1146
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:18,100
- All right, let's say
you came here alone,

1147
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,146
and you brought me the device.

1148
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,167
I suppose that I could just
have Brink shoot you both now.

1149
01:11:38,132 --> 01:11:39,148
- Take it.

1150
01:11:49,507 --> 01:11:50,340
- Empty.

1151
01:11:51,513 --> 01:11:52,833
- What is he doing?

1152
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,380
- You said I was smarter than you thought.

1153
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,890
- This kid is gonna
give me a heart attack.

1154
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:04,793
- Okay, genius.
Where is it?

1155
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:08,580
- You release Kate, when
she's safely down the mountain

1156
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,620
the device will come to you.

1157
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:10,453
- No, Dane!

1158
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,800
- Kate, it's gonna be fine.

1159
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,988
- I like it.

1160
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:20,343
That kind of makes it, sort
of exciting, huh Brink?

1161
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,300
Get her out of here.

1162
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:25,293
- No!

1163
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,397
- Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.

1164
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:36,691
- There she goes...

1165
01:12:39,677 --> 01:12:41,302
So let's have it.

1166
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,243
- Useless!

1167
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:58,610
- Set the timer for five minutes
then give me the trigger.

1168
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:01,540
Well honey, I don't
think you're gonna quite

1169
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:04,980
make it to the bottom, but
we are going to send you

1170
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,047
bombing down this hill.

1171
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,305
- Oh no!

1172
01:13:17,903 --> 01:13:19,899
Up here, somebody help me?

1173
01:13:19,899 --> 01:13:21,316
Somebody help me!

1174
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:26,815
- Clever.

1175
01:13:49,587 --> 01:13:51,679
- So, how does it work?

1176
01:13:52,813 --> 01:13:55,680
- Are you really looking
at me to explain that?

1177
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,855
- See this detonator?

1178
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:01,520
Attached to the bottom
of Kate's gondola... C4.

1179
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,110
It's a messy way to go.

1180
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:07,020
- And I have set the timer.

1181
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:09,411
- For how long?
- Five minutes.

1182
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:10,795
- Ooooo...

1183
01:14:10,795 --> 01:14:12,195
That's tight.

1184
01:14:12,195 --> 01:14:13,403
- Move the teams NOW!

1185
01:14:13,403 --> 01:14:15,413
Go, get the chopper up there!

1186
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:25,170
- Come on kid, you're wasting time.

1187
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:29,500
- Okay, okay, I can kind
of, sort of explain it.

1188
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,910
- Well then kinda, sorta, do it.

1189
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:32,743
- All right.

1190
01:14:32,743 --> 01:14:36,103
It's based off the intention
of the subconscious.

1191
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,030
It takes you to place with pure intent.

1192
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,690
- You expect me to believe that?

1193
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:43,890
- Does anyone?

1194
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:45,930
Look it's how I got home,
it's why it took me to her.

1195
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:47,370
It takes you to what you want most

1196
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:50,223
what in your subconscious you need.

1197
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,500
- You know, that would
have been a nice moment

1198
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,010
that you could have shared with Kate,

1199
01:14:58,010 --> 01:14:59,333
before I killed you both.

1200
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:04,124
- It's okay, Sy, I never
expected to make it

1201
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:06,506
out of here alive anyway.

1202
01:15:18,956 --> 01:15:22,289
- Get out there.
Break out the big stuff.

1203
01:15:24,509 --> 01:15:26,558
It's time to get messy.

1204
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:40,347
- Shoot him.

1205
01:15:52,813 --> 01:15:54,490
- And blow up the girl.

1206
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:56,090
- Why don't you try it first Sy?

1207
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,379
- Why doesn't it work?

1208
01:16:05,379 --> 01:16:07,500
- That would have been
a nice moment for you

1209
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,643
just zapping out of here like that.

1210
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:12,284
- What did you do with it?

1211
01:16:12,284 --> 01:16:14,443
- Nothing, I swear.

1212
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,560
- The interesting thing
about my job is when you lie

1213
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,960
as much as I do, you can
tell when someone else

1214
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:27,423
is not telling the truth, without a doubt.

1215
01:16:29,402 --> 01:16:30,452
- Fiddlesticks!

1216
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:36,357
- Shoot him.

1217
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,330
- Hi Sy!

1218
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:45,640
- Hawks?

1219
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,703
- No, wait.

1220
01:17:00,432 --> 01:17:05,331
- Subject has escaped wearing
a red skit jacket, damn it!

1221
01:17:05,331 --> 01:17:07,813
Get him now, bring him to me NOW!

1222
01:17:17,869 --> 01:17:20,069
- Hey, dickhead!

1223
01:17:32,952 --> 01:17:34,860
Hey, hey, hey, HEY, I'm down here!

1224
01:17:40,214 --> 01:17:42,700
Holy shit!

1225
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,533
Okay...

1226
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:55,542
- Oh, shit!

1227
01:18:08,779 --> 01:18:12,128
- Okay, think, think, what do I do?

1228
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:25,566
That's him! Stop him!

1229
01:18:29,114 --> 01:18:31,364
- Please, somebody help me!

1230
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,290
Shit!

1231
01:18:36,718 --> 01:18:37,551
Oh God

1232
01:18:47,585 --> 01:18:50,201
- Oh shit!

1233
01:19:39,883 --> 01:19:42,785
- Help me, please up here!

1234
01:19:42,785 --> 01:19:44,545
Please, somebody help me!

1235
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,250
- Jesus Christ!

1236
01:20:18,423 --> 01:20:19,590
Sorry asshole.

1237
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:38,500
- Dane!

1238
01:20:39,607 --> 01:20:40,774
- Kate!
Kate!

1239
01:20:42,034 --> 01:20:44,000
- Dane, up here!

1240
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,907
- There's a bomb, there's a bomb on board.

1241
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:49,018
- Yeah, NO SHIT!
Do something!

1242
01:20:49,018 --> 01:20:50,768
- Hang on I'm coming!

1243
01:20:57,181 --> 01:20:58,598
- What are doing?

1244
01:21:19,692 --> 01:21:24,259
- Heights, I shouldn't have
said anything with my luck.

1245
01:21:29,922 --> 01:21:31,806
- Oh, Dane what the hell are you doing?

1246
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:44,107
- Dane, Dane please hurry!

1247
01:21:49,432 --> 01:21:50,265
Dane!

1248
01:22:03,819 --> 01:22:04,878
Dane?

1249
01:22:06,453 --> 01:22:08,015
Dane, it's gonna fall.

1250
01:22:17,384 --> 01:22:19,020
- Oh God, I think my leg is broken.

1251
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,061
- What?
Oh, let me see.

1252
01:22:23,525 --> 01:22:25,080
- Oh shit, look!

1253
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,279
- Yeah I'm looking, I just can't see--

1254
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:27,812
- No, no, NO Look, look, LOOK!

1255
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:32,461
- I gotcha now.

1256
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:33,961
- Oh shit!
Oh shit!

1257
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,200
- This is gonna be so
nice for me, all right.

1258
01:23:12,505 --> 01:23:14,430
- Ha, Ha, HA! Yeah!

1259
01:23:23,055 --> 01:23:24,972
- You have to leave me!

1260
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:30,030
- Time to chop up my problems...

1261
01:23:37,589 --> 01:23:38,681
- Lets go!

1262
01:23:41,047 --> 01:23:42,480
You see me, don't ya?

1263
01:23:49,207 --> 01:23:50,299
What ya got?

1264
01:23:58,752 --> 01:23:59,976
Owwww!

1265
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:07,985
That's a good one Kate, That's--goooood...

1266
01:24:14,265 --> 01:24:15,098
- A knife?

1267
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:18,850
Hey, where did you get that knife?

1268
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:21,153
- Camping supplies, Remember?

1269
01:24:23,064 --> 01:24:25,014
- Where did learn to throw like that?

1270
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:32,388
- You kids had enough fun for one day?

1271
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,320
- You're alive!
- Yep.

1272
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,050
- Where are we?

1273
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:56,910
- The geographic center
of the Sahara Desert,

1274
01:24:56,910 --> 01:25:01,230
3.5 million square miles of sand

1275
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:05,280
and a new distance record for
the axcellerator, actually.

1276
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,645
- Why?

1277
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:10,873
- To rid the world of evil
like you promised me Sy.

1278
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,910
- No, no wait.

1279
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:15,820
- Good luck Sy.

1280
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:19,120
- Wait a minute.
- Goodbye.

1281
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:23,200
- Wait a minute!

1282
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,153
Hawks!

1283
01:25:29,829 --> 01:25:30,662
Hawks!

1284
01:25:33,698 --> 01:25:36,273
HAAAAAAAAWKES!

1285
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:46,410
- Now don't forget you need to
feed him once in the morning

1286
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:49,790
and once in the evening and
take him on at least two walks.

1287
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:52,190
- And no more teleport
experiments, that freaks him out.

1288
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:55,240
- That was a one-time thing
because of the squirrel.

1289
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,240
- Maybe I should have
left him at the vet again.

1290
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,870
- I love animals and
they're fond of me as well.

1291
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:03,220
It's people I can't understand.

1292
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:06,550
- Can we all focus here for a moment?

1293
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:08,900
You two sure you're really up for this?

1294
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,763
A live run, a field test?

1295
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:13,880
- It would have been a little difficult

1296
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,610
to return to delivering pizzas

1297
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:17,320
- Or bagging groceries.

1298
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:20,740
- I have given Tomas free
run of this laboratory.

1299
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:23,260
I'm really excited to see
what you've come up with,

1300
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:24,990
Where are there new devices?

1301
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:26,140
- They're wearing them.

1302
01:26:27,070 --> 01:26:28,970
- Wearing them?

1303
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:32,590
- Yeah, he took some
pretty solid design advice.

1304
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:35,273
- Oh, you're the Versace
of teleportation design.

1305
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:37,830
- That was actually pretty good.

1306
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:40,220
- Oh my God, Why did I
leave planetary security

1307
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:42,513
in the hands of three jokers?
Can we?

1308
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,403
- Yes.
Are we ready?

1309
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,923
- If you want me
you'll find me.

1310
01:26:56,899 --> 01:27:00,899

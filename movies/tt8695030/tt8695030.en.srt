1
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,790
Yuck.

2
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,006
The fire's still warm.

3
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,974
Is that you, hermit Bob?

4
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,512
We kinda can see you.

5
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,062
Farmer Miller says you might have
stole one of his chickens.

6
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,644
That happens to be
against the law.

7
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,907
Now, I'm hoping that it was
a fox that did that.

8
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,282
Up your hole
with a wooden pole, cliff.

9
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,204
That also happens to be
against the law.

10
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,505
Should we take him in?

11
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,674
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

12
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,061
I don't see him.

13
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,401
Uh, we're gonna go back
to town now...

14
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,563
Hermit Bob.

15
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,156
Don't break any more laws.

16
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,818
Just calm down.

17
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,718
Hey, cliff.

18
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,672
Fuck you.

19
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,303
Should we bring him in
one of these days?

20
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,176
I mean...

21
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,767
He fired a weapon at police officers.

22
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,975
Yeah, I don't know.

23
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,066
I doubt he even stole
that chicken.

24
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,819
Farmer Miller
is such an asshole.

25
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,452
I've known Bob
since junior high.

26
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,532
<i>Oh, wow. That must have
been, like, 50 years ago.</i>

27
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,163
Yeah, it was.

28
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,420
You know,
Bob's been out there for years,

29
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,213
eating squirrels and bugs,

30
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,292
and he never hurt anyone
that I ever heard of.

31
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,260
Well, he is kind of unusual.

32
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,972
Is it already 20 after 8:007

33
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,263
shouldn't it be
getting dark by now?

34
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,146
Yeah, this daylight savings thing
is all out of whack lately.

35
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,694
Damn it.

36
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,441
My watch stopped.

37
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,694
Or is broken or something.

38
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,870
Yeah, something weird's going on.

39
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,206
Yeah. Weird.

40
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,260
Yeah, this isn't gonna
end well, cliff.

41
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,908
The ant colonies.

42
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,579
All jacked up like it was
the end of the world.

43
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,555
Hey, Ronnie, you want
to swing by the diner,

44
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,979
get some doughnuts, coffee?

45
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,774
Um... no, thanks.

46
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,189
It seems late for coffee
and doughnuts.

47
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,775
I guess so.

48
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,366
<i>This is home base.
Are you guys reading me? Over.</i>

49
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,371
- Hey, mindy.
- You guys okay out there?

50
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,326
Yeah, we're just, uh, cruising a bit
before we swing on back.

51
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,911
Uh, you need anything?

52
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,877
We could, uh, run by the diner,

53
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,458
pick you up some coffee
and doughnuts.

54
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,551
Negative. Thanks.

55
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,588
There is something strange
going on, though.

56
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,494
Have you guys, by any chance,
noticed that the...

57
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,679
And the daylight and the...

58
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,623
I think the news report...

59
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,479
Hello, hello?

60
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,686
Shit. We lost her.

61
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,942
Use your cell.

62
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,532
That's funny.

63
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,701
It's completely dead.

64
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,041
And it was fully charged.

65
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,709
Hey, cliff, should we listen
to the civilian radio?

66
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,085
Sure. Go ahead.

67
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,058
Wow, that sounds so familiar.

68
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,230
What is that song, Ronnie?

69
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,900
It's "the dead don't die."

70
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,239
By sturgill Simpson.

71
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,950
Sturgill Simpson?

72
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,285
Why does it sound so familiar?

73
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,959
Well, 'cause it's the theme song.

74
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,081
The theme song? Yeah.

75
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,618
How much longer until
my takeout's ready, fern?

76
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,788
<i>Be out shortly, frank.
Just heating it up for you.</i>

77
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,325
Would you mind turning off
that goddamn music?

78
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,120
Fucking sturgill Simpson.

79
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,671
Sure thing.

80
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,637
So, frank,
what makes you so sure

81
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,932
it's hermit Bob
who stole your chicken?

82
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,510
Well, who the hell else
could it be?

83
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,975
That goddamn hairy lunatic,

84
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,853
living out there
all these years like a caveman.

85
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,976
Like some kind of ghost.

86
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,278
Might as well be amish.

87
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,025
Maybe it was a... a fox, frank.

88
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,035
Um, I don't think
Bob ever hurt anybody.

89
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,579
Yeah, well, tell that
to my fucking chickens.

90
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,828
Fox, my ass.

91
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,119
Here you go, frank.

92
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,921
Want me to put that
in a to-go cup for you?

93
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,834
Nah, I can't drink
any more of that stuff.

94
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,385
It's too damn black for me.

95
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,759
I meant it's too strong.

96
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,185
Take care, frank.

97
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,360
Yeah.

98
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,648
This special report:

99
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,155
These activities
could possibly be affecting

100
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,327
the earth's rotation on its axis.

101
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,201
Scientists say even
the slightest change in this balance

102
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,248
in our usual hours of daylight.

103
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,920
Meanwhile, government officials,

104
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,090
as well as the heads of
the energy companies involved,

105
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,668
say the recent extensive
polar fracking

106
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,221
has had no discernible
consequences whatsoever.

107
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,640
Here's what
the energy secretary had to say

108
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,433
in this evening's press conference.

109
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,388
Listen,
these alarmists are dangerous liars.

110
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,143
Let's not believe something

111
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,602
just because one so-called scientist
says it's true.

112
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,483
Polar fracking has created
fantastic jobs,

113
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,156
big profits and energy
for our great country.

114
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,284
Let's not forget our priori...

115
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,737
What you think, fern?

116
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,780
I don't know, Hank.

117
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,783
Shouldn't it be getting dark out?

118
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,448
So, you can see from this diagram

119
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,056
that if the earth is pulled
even slightly off its axis,

120
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,007
the repercussions could be extreme.

121
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,020
Coming up in the next segment...

122
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,980
Holy shit, man, this is crazy.

123
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,900
A change in the earth's
rotation or its spin rate?

124
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,315
That'd be catastrophic,
for sure.

125
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,397
All the cycles of the biosphere
would be affected.

126
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,653
The natural cycles of sunlight
would be disrupted,

127
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,076
plants wouldn't grow,
wind patterns would change,

128
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,619
and tectonic activity...

129
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,746
Forget about it.

130
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,412
The polar caps shifting
would mean...

131
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,040
I don't want to say.

132
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,877
Total planetary destruction.

133
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,879
For real?

134
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,305
Shut up.

135
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,012
Okay, time's up, girls. Way up.

136
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,599
Well, if it isn't Geronimo
on the girls' floor again.

137
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,726
Do you want to be a girl,
Geronimo?

138
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,398
No.

139
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,980
Well, then get back
to the boys' section. Now.

140
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,362
Dennis.

141
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,454
Can you please escort Geronimo
back to the boys' section?

142
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,532
I'll deal with these girls.

143
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,791
<i>Let's go, Geronimo.
You know the drill.</i>

144
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,792
<i>Let's go, you clowns.
It's bedtime for bozos.</i>

145
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,298
You two ladies, too. Let's go.

146
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,333
Secretary of energy pillerton, however,

147
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,932
fully refutes these speculations,
insisting...

148
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,585
See you, Bobby.

149
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,440
- Excellent.
- You got it? Need a bag?

150
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,767
- No, thanks.
- All right.

151
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,648
- Bye, Bobby.
- See you guys.

152
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,479
Wow, it's still so light out.

153
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,485
Okay. So...

154
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,379
- Bilbo Baggins.
- Hey, Dean.

155
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,802
- What's up, buddy?
- How's things?

156
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,427
<i>After-hours delivery, wu-ps.
Check this out.</i>

157
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,929
Got some
weird news of the world.

158
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,429
The earth off its axis.

159
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,890
That's bad news.

160
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,652
This is for you right here,
for your collection.

161
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,197
Oh, man. Starlog.

162
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,913
Eerie.

163
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,373
Creepy, number 61.

164
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,576
April 1974.

165
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,377
<i>Oh, man. Here, let me
give you some money.</i>

166
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,674
No, that's on me.

167
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,586
- Add it to your collection.
- Thanks, man.

168
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,592
Just give me
your herbie hancock right here,

169
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,514
and I'll be on my way.

170
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,851
They need to fix the ac.

171
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,179
You know, it's kind of hot
in this motherfucker, huh?

172
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,268
All right.

173
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,849
Okay-dokay.

174
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,935
All right,
see you next week, Frodo.

175
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,323
Hey, Dean.

176
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,318
I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind just, uh,

177
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,822
dropping a little wisdom
until the next delivery.

178
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,868
The world is perfect.

179
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,419
Appreciate the details.

180
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,559
"The world is perfect.

181
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,433
Appreciate the details."

182
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,982
You guys shouldn't be here.

183
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,118
Strange.

184
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,167
Tasty porcinis.

185
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,928
Okay.

186
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,234
Mmm.

187
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,886
Kitty!

188
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,401
<i>Good evening.
This is posie juarez.</i>

189
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:23,286
We interrupt this program for
a Centerville 7 news special report.

190
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,618
People are saying their pets
have either just disappeared

191
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,330
or are acting unusually
skittish and aggressive.

192
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,164
Here's a report from harrisville.

193
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,046
Look at this.

194
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,139
And when [ Finally did find her,
she was under the house.

195
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,524
She's very gentle and...

196
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,520
<i>That's so strange.
Where are you guys?</i>

197
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,777
And she had
this wild look in her eye.

198
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,196
And when I finally tried
to pull her out,

199
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,531
she scratched me all to shreds,
like a wild animal.

200
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,583
That's so creepy. I knew...

201
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,250
We're back?

202
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,420
Hello.

203
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,341
Wow, that is strange, and it seems
to be happening all over.

204
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,214
We'll have more reports at 11:00.

205
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,055
But for now, this is posie juarez
for Centerville 7 news.

206
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,845
<i>Stay safe...
And keep your eyes open.</i>

207
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,094
Rumsfeld.

208
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,602
Rumsfeld. Here, boy.

209
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,059
Where the hell are you?

210
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,775
Goddamn dog.

211
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,654
Rumsfeld? You out here?

212
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,576
<i>Rumsfeld, what you doing over there?
Get your ass inside.</i>

213
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,711
Come on, stupid.

214
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,467
Hey.

215
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,220
What are you doing?

216
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,009
Goddamn it.

217
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,809
Holy shit.

218
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,562
Who stole my fucking cows?

219
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,482
Where the hell are my chickens?

220
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,745
Frank's cows.

221
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,410
Into the woods, ladies.

222
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,039
Welcome to my world.

223
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,929
Damn it, Mallory.

224
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,145
Even dead, you reek of chardonnay.

225
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,226
Cheap chardonnay.

226
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,867
- How's she looking?
- Well, she's not getting any older.

227
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:11,407
<i>Wow. The diner sure makes
the world's best coffee, doesn't it?</i>

228
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,459
Yeah, but how can you
drink it so late?

229
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,505
- Won't it keep you up?
- No, I sleep like a baby.

230
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,819
Except maybe when I know there's
a corpse waiting for me at work.

231
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,418
Oh, yeah.

232
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,009
Cliff, is the coroner from latrobe
gonna pick her up tomorrow?

233
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,328
It's getting a little creepy
being here alone

234
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,468
with Mallory decomposing in there.

235
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,596
Yeah, they're supposed to come
pick her up tomorrow morning.

236
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,522
Thank god.

237
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,146
I don't know why she can't be
over at the funeral home.

238
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,525
'Cause she's going
to Potter's field in latrobe.

239
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,532
And 'cause our new,
unusual undertaker,

240
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,237
<i>Ms. Winston,
has got those two golfers</i>

241
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,413
<i>that were struck by lightning...
The logans.</i>

242
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:04,798
<i>Thanks, Ronnie.
It's not really necessary, but...</i>

243
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,925
Can I, uh,
drive you home, mindy?

244
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:10,053
<i>Also not necessary, Ronnie.
You know I have my car here.</i>

245
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:11,801
Oh, yeah.

246
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,308
- How is the prius running?
- Fine.

247
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,631
Can you even fit two people
in that little smart car of yours?

248
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,393
Well, yeah. Holds two nicely.

249
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,063
This daylight thing
is bothering me.

250
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,194
It's strange.

251
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,694
<i>Well, what can I say?
The world is kind of strange lately.</i>

252
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,654
Yeah, it sure is.

253
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,786
If you ask me, this whole thing
is gonna end badly.

254
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,038
So, what exactly
do you mean, Ronnie?

255
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,127
Oh, uh, don't know.

256
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,256
<i>Just a feeling, I guess.
Strong feeling.</i>

257
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:47,921
Oh, boy.

258
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,090
You okay doing the whole
night shift alone, cliff?

259
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,350
Yeah, I can take a nap.

260
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,053
I mean, I can just lie down
in that other cell

261
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,480
next to old Mallory.

262
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,061
Oh, god.

263
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,484
Next to her... her dead body?

264
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,323
Might bring back some old memories.

265
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,572
See you guys tomorrow.

266
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,625
- See you, cliff.
- Yeah, see you tomorrow, chief.

267
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,251
"This is all gonna end badly."

268
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,383
What does that mean?

269
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,048
I knew Mallory o'brien
since I was a kid.

270
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:36,511
And believe it or not,
she was a pretty young thing, too.

271
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,096
Please.

272
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,563
Sorry, but good riddance
to that drunken old goat.

273
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,315
Well, I... I don't know, fern.

274
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,655
Jeez, I got to get up out of here.

275
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,659
I got to, uh, get to the hardware store
early tomorrow morning.

276
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,830
I'm looking forward
to seeing you ladies tomorrow.

277
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,784
- Take care, Hank.
- Good night, Hank. Sweet dreams.

278
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,983
Hank is such a gentleman.

279
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,417
Sure is.

280
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:09,339
Well, I better
get started cleaning here.

281
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,760
<i>Listen, Lily. I've been dying to ask you
about that new foreign woman</i>

282
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:17,014
<i>that took over the funeral home.
What's her name?</i>

283
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,688
<i>Her name is Zelda Winston.
And she's strange, for sure.</i>

284
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,890
And she's got these, like,
really weird eyes,

285
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,896
like she's, like,
looking right through you.

286
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,228
She pays me really well, though.

287
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,777
Zelda. What kind of name is that?

288
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:34,201
<i>I don't know. She's probably, like,
Irish or Scottish or whatever.</i>

289
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,850
And she talks really funny, though,
so I don't always get it right.

290
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,115
But I like the name Zelda.

291
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,998
It reminds me of, um,
Zelda Fitzgerald.

292
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,503
Who's that?

293
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,047
That's great gatsby's wife.

294
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,418
And who's that?

295
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,379
That's the really rich guy
from the 1920s.

296
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,430
The Robert redford guy.

297
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,097
Well, anyway,
so what's it like over there

298
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,850
in those secret rooms
since she took over?

299
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,684
Well, there's these, like,
really creepy back rooms,

300
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,860
you know, where they, like,
keep all the stiffs.

301
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,906
And then next to that,
there's this big golden Buddha.

302
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,200
- A what, now?
- There's a big, shiny, golden Buddha.

303
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,326
And then there's these, like,
old-looking samurai swords on a rack.

304
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,616
Really?

305
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,354
Amituofo.

306
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,783
Well, that's peculiar.

307
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,208
Now, stay put, will you?

308
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,215
What is it, Liv?

309
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,433
You okay?

310
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,230
Yeah. I guess so.

311
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,484
I just got this creepy feeling.

312
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,445
You were probably just
having a bad dream.

313
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,030
Yeah, guess so.

314
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,108
A bad dream.

315
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,487
<i>It's okay.
Just go back to sleep.</i>

316
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,199
Thanks, stell.

317
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,236
Hmm. Toxic lunar vibrations.

318
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,049
All right, honey, I'm done.

319
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,255
I'm leaving your money here.

320
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,179
I'm out of here, lil.

321
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,681
Okay, fern. See you tomorrow.

322
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,854
Not if I see you first.

323
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,101
Very funny.

324
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,191
Excuse me, we're closed.

325
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,109
What... what happened to you?

326
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,528
Aah! Lily!

327
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,703
Oh, get the fuck away from me,

328
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,872
<i>you little motherfucker!
Oh, I'll fucking kill you!</i>

329
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,079
I'll shove this mop up
your fucking ass, motherfucker!

330
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,078
Get the fuck away from me!

331
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,448
Coffee.

332
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,380
Coffee.

333
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,008
Coffee.

334
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,421
<i>Centerville police department.
This is chief robertson.</i>

335
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,215
Hi, Hank. What's up?

336
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,085
Is it really 6:30?

337
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:18,891
What?

338
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,604
At the diner?

339
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,584
Uh, like I said on the phone, cliff,

340
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,004
often, fern gets here early,

341
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,878
and so I thought I might
get some coffee to go.

342
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,459
And... and then this.

343
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,635
Oh, my god. I saw them.

344
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,590
Fern and Lily.

345
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,225
Oh, man.

346
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,467
Uh, what the hell was it?

347
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,761
<i>A wild animal?
Uh, several wild animals?</i>

348
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,801
I don't know.

349
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:48,269
But whatever it was,
it even smashed the coffeepots.

350
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,720
Oh, yuck.

351
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,616
Jesus Christ, cliff.

352
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,700
What the heck was it,
a wild animal?

353
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,415
Several wild animals?

354
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,163
That's exactly what I said.

355
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,561
Hey, guys.

356
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,230
<i>Wow. Fern's really done wonders
with these flower beds.</i>

357
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,353
Really perks up the place, huh?

358
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,071
What?

359
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,202
- What happened?
- God, mindy.

360
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,706
I don't think you want to see this.

361
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,438
Uh, no, no, I didn't need to see that.

362
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,397
Was it a wild animal?

363
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,112
Or several wild animals?

364
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,241
Cliff, is that really
fern and Lily in there?

365
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,157
Uh, no.

366
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:15,079
That was fern and Lily, but now...

367
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,882
Do you need me here?

368
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,885
Maybe you could help out
with crowd control.

369
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,679
Okay, folks, can you move it
along now, please?

370
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,310
Thank you.

371
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,562
I can't believe it.

372
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:52,332
God, Ronnie. This is really awful.

373
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,909
Maybe the worst thing
I've ever seen.

374
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,790
Yeah. Sure is.

375
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,839
I... I got to go.

376
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,396
So, what are you thinking?

377
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,615
You... you really want to know?

378
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,581
I'm thinking zombies.

379
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,500
What?

380
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,918
You know, zombies.

381
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,292
Ghouls. The undead.

382
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,546
Are you...

383
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,253
You're trying to tell me...

384
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,883
You're thinking zombies did this?

385
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:54,977
Yep.

386
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:21,501
Hey, Jack, will you check your phone
and see where we are exactly?

387
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,706
Yeah.

388
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,923
<i>Oh, man. I'm not getting
any reception out here.</i>

389
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,686
Jeez, I don't even know
if my phone's working, for some reason.

390
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,897
Let me try the radio.

391
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,903
Oh, wow, it's working again, so...

392
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,673
They're absolutely wrong.

393
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:54,070
We know very well that polar fracking
has been great for this country.

394
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,248
In my opinion, these naysayers
should just move to somewhere else

395
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,667
- where they don't have to...
- I'm not listening to this.

396
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,884
<i>"the dead don't die."
I love this song.</i>

397
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,264
Thanks.

398
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,575
<i>Oh, shit, you guys.
We have to stop and get gas.</i>

399
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,414
Look. Gas sign right there.

400
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,128
<i>Okay, cool.
Come back soon, okay?</i>

401
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,504
See you, Bobby.

402
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,554
- Stay sick, guys.
- Turn blue, Bobby.

403
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,053
Hey, kids, how's it going?

404
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,475
Eat me.

405
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,450
Whoa, this place is a trip.

406
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,198
Sure is.

407
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,114
Oh. Hi.

408
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,415
Hi.

409
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,371
Nice shirt.

410
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,373
Nosferatu. Yeah.

411
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,291
It's really cool.

412
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,504
Thanks. I make 'em.

413
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,257
<i>How about that?
Earth off its axis.</i>

414
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,384
- End of the world.
- Mm.

415
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,847
Flesh-eating zombies.

416
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,099
You get a lot of zombies
around here?

417
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,852
That depends, I guess.

418
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:33,317
<i>Uh, so... so, about the gas.
You want to pay cash or credit?</i>

419
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,196
Here you go, Frodo.

420
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,486
Cool. Thanks.

421
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,865
Uh, did you, uh...

422
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,202
Did you just call me Frodo?

423
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,456
Did I?

424
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,584
Hey, is there a motel in town?

425
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:53,462
- Yeah, there is one just down the...
- Ooh.

426
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:57,887
<i>Oh, that's a really good cd.
Sturgill Simpson, "the dead don't die."</i>

427
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,839
Yeah, I know. I love this song.

428
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,299
Is it nice?

429
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,177
- What?
- The motel.

430
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,562
<i>Oh, yeah.
It's, uh... it's kind of cool.</i>

431
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,264
It's one of those old-school ones.

432
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,934
Like in old-school horror movies,
with, like...

433
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,236
Like in psycho
with the separated bungalows?

434
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,898
Uh, the bates motel in psycho

435
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:20,281
was not separated into
"little bungalows."

436
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,746
- Ooh.
- All right.

437
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:29,415
That's 12 for the cd
and two dollars for the soda.

438
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,666
<i>Here you go.
You can just keep the change.</i>

439
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:32,838
Oh, cool.

440
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,132
Whoa.

441
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,092
That's a super cool ride,
by the way.

442
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,724
Very, uh, George romero.

443
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,270
Yeah, it's a classic.

444
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,726
<i>Your film knowledge is impressive.
What's your name?</i>

445
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,153
Bobby. Bobby wiggins.

446
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,819
What's that? Bobby Baggins?

447
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:00,817
No, wiggins.

448
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,277
I'm Zoe.

449
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,703
Thanks, Bobby.

450
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,550
Will the feds be brought in on this?

451
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,094
It's... it's really weird.

452
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,595
I see.

453
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,306
But miss o'brien...

454
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,728
So she has to stay with us
another night?

455
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,688
Oh, god.

456
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,145
Okay. Thank you.

457
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,108
Hello, Ms. Winston.

458
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:27,161
<i>Hello, officer Minerva Morrison.
Do call me Zelda.</i>

459
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:28,829
Yeah, okay, sure.

460
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,699
You've been informed
of the tragedy?

461
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,286
<i>I have. Am I to understand
that the remains will be brought</i>

462
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,748
to the ever after funeral home
for my preparations?

463
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,674
Uh, no, that won't be necessary.

464
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,481
The feds have already
collected the remains.

465
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,991
They've brought them
out of the county.

466
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,130
I see.

467
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,315
Is there anything else I can do?

468
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,610
<i>Yes. I do have
an unrelated question.</i>

469
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,439
Shoot. "Shoot"?

470
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,273
I mean ask me.

471
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,574
Oh, yes.

472
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:10,405
<i>Are you, by any chance, a couple?
You and the physically attractive one?</i>

473
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,749
Um, you mean the younger one?

474
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,042
Officer Peterson?

475
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,745
<i>That's the one I mean.
Officer Ronald Peterson.</i>

476
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,007
Well, actually, no.

477
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,177
Why do you ask, Zelda?

478
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,089
Just accumulating local information.

479
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:32,469
Oh. Okay.

480
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,190
<i>Dear Jesus. I mean,
that's absolutely horrible.</i>

481
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,785
I mean, who or what is
perpetrating these... these...

482
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,157
Hey.

483
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:52,785
- What's going on?
- Hey.

484
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:58,120
Nice car. '08 Pontiac lemans.

485
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,000
Yeah. It's a beauty, huh?

486
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,207
It's our friend's
totally rad ride.

487
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,461
It's a classic.

488
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,006
Have a good one.

489
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,714
- Later.
- Guys, I'm so hungry.

490
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:10,969
Same. Let's eat.

491
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,600
I'll ask. Hey.

492
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,888
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

493
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,645
Uh, do you guys know if there's
a diner or restaurant nearby?

494
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,850
Sorry.

495
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:25,109
The only diner in town
is closed, indefinitely.

496
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,530
Well, that's unfortunate.

497
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,734
Uh, but we, uh, have
several vending machines

498
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,491
containing snacks, uh,
right over by the office.

499
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,118
<i>Okay. Thanks. Do you have change
for three dollars?</i>

500
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,540
Yeah, I do.

501
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,552
I like your badge.

502
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,848
Oh, th-thank you.

503
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,471
That's, uh...

504
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,769
- That... that should be good.
- Oh, okay.

505
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,975
- Thanks.
- Oh, no, no.

506
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,525
You can, you can have it. Yeah?

507
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,818
Okay. Thanks.

508
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:11,113
<i>They just checked in.
Hipsters from the big city.</i>

509
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,869
- Yeah?
- Yep.

510
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,205
My educated guess
would be Pittsburgh.

511
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,158
They got that urban style,
you know.

512
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,998
Oh, well, those plates
are from Ohio,

513
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,796
so my educated guess
would be Cleveland.

514
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:28,593
Oh. Cleveland. Hmm.

515
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,342
Yeah, Cleveland.

516
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,674
Thanks.

517
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,259
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

518
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,542
That girl's part Mexican.

519
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,729
- Hmm?
- Really? How can you tell?

520
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:47,277
<i>I have an affinity for Mexicans.
They're, like, my favorite people.</i>

521
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:49,856
<i>I love Mexico.
I've been down there twice.</i>

522
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,694
Okay, Ronnie, then you
should be the one to inform them

523
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,996
that if they're gonna spend
the night in Centerville,

524
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:01,667
to not go out and to keep
their hotel room door locked.

525
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:02,754
Okay?

526
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:12,094
Uh, you know, cliff, uh...

527
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,557
I know this isn't important
comparatively, uh...

528
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,135
But, uh, all of my cats are gone.

529
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,267
<i>And, normally, they...
They, uh, just stay inside.</i>

530
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,901
<i>Well, I'm sorry about that, Danny.
They could be hiding.</i>

531
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,193
Nothing is happening normally
right now.

532
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,318
- Yeah.
- How did they react?

533
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,655
They said, "I heard you had
a lot of zombies around here,"

534
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,286
and then they laughed.

535
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:45,461
Infernal hipsters
with their irony.

536
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,205
Melville.

537
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,549
"Nameless miseries
of the numberless mortals."

538
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:47,390
Well, everything
looks normal out there.

539
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,600
Yeah.

540
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:52,023
But what happened
sounds like the start

541
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,945
of a gruesome horror film.

542
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,148
- Sure does.
- Boo!

543
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,118
Really, really not funny,
Geronimo.

544
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,539
You guys hear about those
grisly murders at the diner?

545
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,163
Yeah. Just talking about them.

546
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,791
<i>Creepy. I've been
listening to the radio,</i>

547
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,588
and I'm sure it's the undead, yo.

548
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,750
Reanimated by the earth
being thrown off its axis

549
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,301
from the polar fracking.

550
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,090
What are you saying?

551
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,263
Full-on zombie apocalypse, baby.

552
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,761
Soon, there'll be hordes of them.

553
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,097
- Geronimo.
- Shit.

554
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,978
Do you want to lose
your privileges again?

555
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:31,855
No, sir.

556
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,311
Then let's go.

557
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,197
Unbelievable.

558
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,448
Cliff,
why'd they used to separate

559
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,389
the children's graves from the adults'?

560
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:10,106
<i>Don't know. Some kind of
a 19th-century thing.</i>

561
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,307
Huh.

562
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,810
Seems like a bad idea somehow.

563
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:18,731
<i>Yeah. So, what exactly are we
looking for here? Zombies?</i>

564
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:19,941
Whoal

565
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,754
Hey, look over here.

566
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,833
Here's another one.

567
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,515
<i>Oh, man.
This isn't gonna end well.</i>

568
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,418
Goddamn it.

569
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,591
Ghouls.

570
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,506
This is undead, reanimated,

571
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:29,719
<i>full-on, flesh-eating zombie shit.
No question.</i>

572
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,665
I was supposed to retire.

573
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,291
- Two years ago.
- I know.

574
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,466
Why didn't you? What?

575
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,043
Retire two years ago.

576
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,508
Are we improvising here?

577
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,557
No, I was just asking.

578
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,639
But I probably know
the answer anyway.

579
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,437
Probably. Yeah.

580
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,024
So, is our plan
to continue to inform people

581
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,652
about the zombie danger
before it gets dark?

582
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,907
Oh, god, Ronnie.

583
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,781
Uh... I guess so.

584
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,488
Because we passed
farmer Miller's place a little while ago.

585
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,948
Do we need to inform him?

586
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,374
Fuck farmer Miller.

587
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,789
Really? He is a citizen of Centerville.

588
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,130
You're right. Uh...

589
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,134
We'll have mindy call him.

590
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,465
Oh, okay.

591
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:02,570
So, Ronnie, how the fuck
do you kill a zombie?

592
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,317
Well, you got to kill the head.

593
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,158
"Kill the head." Yeah.

594
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,282
By any means necessary,
kill the head.

595
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,531
<i>Decapitate.
It's the only way to kill them.</i>

596
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,285
Jesus.

597
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:25,968
And that's really the only way
to stop zombies,

598
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,010
is to kill the head, Hank.

599
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:33,510
I know it's gruesome,
but complete decapitation.

600
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:38,764
Doesn't matter if you use
a machete, steel wire,

601
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,975
hedge clippers, whatever.

602
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,691
Just as long as the spinal cord
is severed, right?

603
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:48,070
And the head... is cut off.

604
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,486
And that's it. De-animated.

605
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:58,292
Only way to kill the dead:
Kill the head.

606
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,868
Uh, wait, Bobby.

607
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,251
I... I'm not so sure it was zombies.

608
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,762
You said they ate
Lily and fern's flesh.

609
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,515
Usually, they go for the brains.

610
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:16,594
It's unusual, but...

611
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,021
It's still cannibals, man.

612
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,727
Mm.

613
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:25,569
Definitely zombies. Okay?

614
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,693
Hank, you can trust me.

615
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:32,527
I've seen almost every
zombie film ever made.

616
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:33,906
Mm.

617
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:37,080
This is zombie shit going down,
and we got to get prepared.

618
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,953
I don't know
what to think anymore.

619
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,961
Hank, the shells.

620
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:44,755
Oh, yeah.

621
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:50,677
Better safe than sorry.

622
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,721
Yeah, you're right.

623
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,259
Safe than sorry.

624
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,683
Just kill the head.

625
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,688
Several other shocking
and brutal attacks

626
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,566
occurred in this residential neighborhood
just outside east Brady.

627
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,865
The images are just too gruesome
to broadcast at this time,

628
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,614
and police are saying
that it almost looked like

629
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,447
the victims were attacked
by a wild animal

630
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:20,578
or perhaps several wild animals.

631
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,455
Police did provide this map showing...

632
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,791
Goddamn it,
my watch doesn't fucking work.

633
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,672
I just got it. It's mad expensive.

634
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,593
<i>Holy shit, dude, this is insane.
“Wow.</i>

635
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:39,051
Maybe that Harry Potter guy at
the gas station wasn't kidding, man.

636
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,727
What, about what?

637
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,918
- About there being zombies around here.
- That's not even funny.

638
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,024
<i>Don't joke.
It's really, really creepy.</i>

639
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,069
Authorities are warning
all citizens to stay inside

640
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:52,023
and keep all doors and windows
locked and secured.

641
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,153
- Zack, lock the door, will you?
- Got you.

642
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,281
But for now, this is posie juarez
for Centerville 7 news.

643
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,948
Stay safe and keep your eyes open.

644
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,019
Kitties!

645
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,023
Where are you guys?

646
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,898
Kitties!

647
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:22,863
Kitties!

648
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,954
What in the name of...

649
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,415
Cats are gone.

650
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,252
Haven't seen or heard a bird
in two days.

651
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,146
It's already night out.

652
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,339
It's 5:00.

653
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,057
Dear lord in heaven, help us.

654
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,010
Free cable.

655
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,938
Oh, it's free ca... aah!

656
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,821
Thank god you guys are back.

657
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,285
Jesus, cliff, do we really need
all this stuff?

658
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,501
What's all this for?

659
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,922
<i>We went by the hardware store.
You know what happens.</i>

660
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:18,301
Hank and that hobbit kid Bobby
from the gas station

661
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,868
have locked themselves in over there.

662
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,974
They tried to convince
other citizens to join them,

663
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,641
but with no success.

664
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:28,061
<i>Why? What's happening?
Is it some sort of epidemic or what?</i>

665
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,143
It's zombies.

666
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,840
- What are you saying?
- Well, it's the undead.

667
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,775
They've been reanimated.

668
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:40,608
Caused by the earth
having been pulled off its axis,

669
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,901
caused by the polar fracking.

670
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,611
But the authorities
and energy people

671
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,162
keep saying that's not true.

672
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,493
Really?

673
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,217
Oh, my god.

674
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,885
- She's alive?
- No.

675
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,213
She's not. She's just undead.

676
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,257
Chardonnay.

677
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,433
<i>Holy shit.
Did she just say "chardonnay"?</i>

678
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:11,764
Yeah, she did.

679
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:14,603
Look out, kids.

680
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,643
Hey, little Mallory.

681
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,697
Chardonnay.

682
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,323
I got this, cliff.

683
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,972
Chardonnay.

684
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,770
Those are some pretty good cuts.

685
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,661
You played some
minor league ball, didn't you?

686
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,109
<i>Well, um, a little class a.
It was a long time ago.</i>

687
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,238
Mindy, just remember
to kill the head.

688
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:08,908
Okay.

689
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:11,081
Kill the head. Okay.

690
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,829
Ronnie, take this thing
out of here.

691
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:15,334
You got it, chief.

692
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,457
Oh, that's very nice.

693
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,425
Very nice, indeed.

694
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,676
You look gorgeous.

695
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:32,053
You two could have been the king
and queen of the golf club, so you could.

696
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,102
Oh, my.

697
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,066
What's this?

698
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,913
Are you in this together?

699
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,042
I mean, this is
really inappropriate.

700
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:02,586
Oh, good grief.

701
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:09,340
So, the dead just don't want
to die today. Is that it?

702
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:23,153
That's a shame.

703
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,072
I had them looking so bonny.

704
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,489
Oh, what is it now?

705
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,083
Who's there?

706
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:49,508
Shit.

707
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,183
Who the fuck are you,
and what do you want?

708
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:04,486
Ow! Hey!

709
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,233
Get the fuck...

710
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:19,826
Shit.

711
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,669
I killed him.

712
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,547
That was weird.

713
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,044
Candy.

714
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:30,258
- Candy.
- Snapple.

715
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:32,384
Snapple.

716
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,014
Snickers.

717
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,896
- Popsicle.
- Snickers.

718
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,856
Popsicle.

719
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,575
Popsicle.

720
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,709
Toys.

721
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,463
Skittles.

722
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,134
Toys.

723
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,858
Wi-Fi.

724
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,604
Wi-Fi.

725
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,405
Bluetooth.

726
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,819
Bluetooth.

727
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,080
Siri.

728
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,744
- Xanax.
- Oxy.

729
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:48,005
- Xanax.
- Oxy.

730
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,587
- Ambien.
- Oxy.

731
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,931
Guitar.

732
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:00,852
Guitar.

733
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,855
Tools. Drill.

734
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,233
Sander.

735
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,060
Tools.

736
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,776
- Hey, no. Come on.
- Hey. Hey.

737
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,698
Okay, okay. Holy shit.

738
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,777
- Hey, we need to mow them down.
- Come on, man.

739
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,231
Bobby. Shit.

740
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,539
I got this one, Hank.

741
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,265
Shit.

742
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,562
Hey, Bobby!

743
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,934
The head, Hank!

744
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:53,647
I killed the head.

745
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,369
What the fuck? Is this for real?

746
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:10,046
- Shh, shh! Shh, shh, shh.
- Quiet!

747
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,212
Get the fuck off me!

748
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:18,046
- Fuck!
- Holy shit!

749
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,055
Shithead!

750
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,101
Save me!

751
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,726
- What? No!
- What are you doing? Stop!

752
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,776
Get the fuck off me!

753
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,402
Closet.

754
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,857
- Fuck!
- Fucking shithead!

755
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:46,912
Violent...

756
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,995
Reports of these
bizarre attacks are escalating,

757
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,831
with incidents occurring sporadically
across the country

758
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:56,544
and, as we're now learning,
uh, across the globe.

759
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,424
You see, these violent marauders

760
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,723
have apparently first
been gathering in cemeteries,

761
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:05,552
then dispersing
into towns and suburbs,

762
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:07,433
while other reports suggest...

763
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,818
Great.

764
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,028
Now even the radio's dead.

765
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,488
Good riddance.

766
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,621
Guys...

767
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,913
Shouldn't we be telling each other
that it's all gonna be okay?

768
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,707
That this will all go away,
like a bad dream?

769
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,263
Ronnie?

770
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,299
Gee, mindy,
I'm not sure I can say that.

771
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:50,889
Cliff?

772
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:53,565
Please?

773
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,023
It's all gonna be okay, mindy.

774
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:02,363
Maybe it'll all just go away,
like a bad dream.

775
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:07,872
I doubt it.

776
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,615
Cleveland.

777
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,920
What the...

778
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:09,301
Now, that's what I call
a murder of crows.

779
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:34,659
Darn, she's really good
with that thing, isn't she?

780
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:36,119
She sure is.

781
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,129
She's strange.

782
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:46,888
- She's Scottish.
- She's Scottish?

783
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:04,067
Let's unbolt the door
and get her in here.

784
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:12,372
Thank you very much,
officer Ronald Peterson.

785
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:17,168
<i>Chief Clifford robertson.
Officer Minerva Morrison.</i>

786
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,956
What exactly is your plan of action,
chief Clifford robertson?

787
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,542
Well... well...

788
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,549
Uh, it's a little quieter now.

789
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,882
<i>I... I think... I guess we should
just get in the patrol car...</i>

790
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:34,640
<i>Some of us, anyway...
And, uh, patrol the community.</i>

791
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,347
- After all, that is our job.
- I'm not staying here.

792
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,182
I think we should all go together.

793
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,185
Well, I guess you're right.

794
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:48,237
I could stay here and monitor things,
if that would help.

795
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:52,741
I'm quite confident of my ability
to defend myself against the undead.

796
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,368
Well, I... I can see that.

797
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:02,664
But, uh, can you operate
the police radio and our computer?

798
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,879
Oh, aye. No bother.

799
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:10,467
Certainly.

800
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:13,800
- Yeah, if it still works.
- I don't know.

801
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:18,062
That would be a little unusual,
wouldn't it, cliff?

802
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,919
Well, this is a highly
unusual situation we're in,

803
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,275
is it not, chief Clifford robertson?

804
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:28,902
Perhaps we could all meet up again
in a wee while in the cemetery.

805
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,698
<i>Yeah, it's okay.
I guess it's okay.</i>

806
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,910
<i>Uh, let's go, guys. We've got
some more weapons in the patrol car.</i>

807
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:42,211
Excuse me, officer Ronald Peterson.

808
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:45,506
Might I request that I have the use
of your own personal vehicle?

809
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:51,091
Oh. Oh, uh... okay.

810
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:58,602
Oh. Star wars.

811
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,270
Excellent fiction.

812
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:03,225
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, well, yeah.
- Mm.

813
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:06,026
- It's the, uh...
- Red convertible smart car?

814
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:07,148
Yes.

815
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:17,617
Mind how you go.

816
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,570
Slow down a second, cliff.

817
01:12:58,416 --> 01:12:59,701
Excuse me.

818
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,834
Yes.

819
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:07,956
Kill the head.

820
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:28,017
They gravitate towards things
they did when they were alive.

821
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,065
Yeah.

822
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,822
Tennis girl's kind of cute.

823
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:36,738
Geez, cliff.

824
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,987
This is way too creepy.

825
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,004
Oh, god.

826
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,051
I know those kids.

827
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,800
But they're all dead.

828
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,603
Watch it, cliff.

829
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:16,357
Did you have to do that?

830
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,113
I'm sorry. I didn't see him.

831
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:21,742
<i>Well, it doesn't matter, mindy.
They're already dead.</i>

832
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,909
<i>Well, undead, to be precise.
Reanimated.</i>

833
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,381
Fucking trespasser.

834
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,083
Kiss your ass goodbye.

835
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,976
Oh, shit, where are they all
coming from?

836
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,666
It seems pretty quiet.

837
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,965
But door number three is open,
so I'm gonna check it out.

838
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,588
Let's both check it out.

839
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,715
Well, I'm coming, too.

840
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,865
Oh, that's bad.

841
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,095
Sturgill Simpson.

842
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,500
Oh, my god.

843
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:20,670
Why did you do that?

844
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,136
They're not zombies.

845
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,470
They're just dead people.

846
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:32,053
Well, yeah, for now,
they're still just dead hipsters,

847
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:33,854
but they haven't turned yet.

848
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:35,181
It can take a while.

849
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:37,016
He's right, mindy.

850
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,020
Now they're just...

851
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,857
Dead hipsters from Cleveland.

852
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,987
Oh, my god. I can't.

853
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,832
My god.

854
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,492
Well, look at all of you.

855
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:32,370
So very ravenous,

856
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,741
yet well past your expiration date.

857
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:52,926
<i>Oh, man.
Get a load of these two.</i>

858
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,224
Coffee.

859
01:18:57,358 --> 01:19:01,021
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

860
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,384
Oh, god. Not that again.

861
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,379
Sturgill Simpson.

862
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:33,761
Great song.

863
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:53,451
<i>Goddamn it.
I can't take any more.</i>

864
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,286
That was irrational, cliff.

865
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:38,030
<i>Fuck. Do you think Hank
and Bobby wiggins are still in there?</i>

866
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:43,869
Should we try to get 'em out?

867
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:47,335
Uh, cliff, we're drawing
some attention.

868
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,588
Oh, god, cliff.

869
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:52,211
Please get us out of here.

870
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,844
Please, cliff. Please.

871
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,472
That should hold.

872
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,523
Goddamn zombies, Bobby.

873
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:25,369
<i>I know those guys.
They were two of my best customers.</i>

874
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:29,002
<i>Yeah, yeah, the good brothers.
Travis and Dallas good.</i>

875
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,879
They died in a car crash
some time back.

876
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,010
Oh, shit.

877
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,346
Yeah, now I remember those guys.

878
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:41,268
<i>The good brothers.
They were really good guitar pickers.</i>

879
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,638
<i>That's right. It's like
they came out of the birth canal</i>

880
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,769
with guitars in their hands.

881
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:52,029
I think you saved my life, man.

882
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:54,815
No worries, Hank.

883
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:02,577
Shit.

884
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:05,205
- What?
- The fucking back door.

885
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:07,912
The back door
to the storage room.

886
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,792
- What?
- Here.

887
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:15,503
Jesus, Bobby.

888
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:17,713
Shit.

889
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,056
There's way too many, Hank.

890
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:27,140
This here is a nightmare, Bobby.

891
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:28,878
We're goners, man.

892
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:31,018
Fuck.

893
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,770
Come on. Give me that!

894
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:16,505
Well, I'll be a monkey's ass.

895
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,442
It's finally payback time.

896
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,903
<i>You goddamn refugees!
I'll get all of you!</i>

897
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,784
You're gonna pay for this!

898
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:30,168
Get off my property!

899
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,620
- Hey! Ow!
- Mmm.

900
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:35,215
This is good chicken.

901
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,132
Damn it! Hey!

902
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:44,842
Stay back!

903
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,611
You want to get out and check?

904
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:10,250
Uh, I'd... I'd rather not.

905
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,330
Well, that's perfect, isn't it?

906
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,174
Right in the middle
of the fucking cemetery.

907
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:20,344
No, it isn't perfect.

908
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:23,847
Why did you run over them?

909
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:31,564
They are not
ordinary pedestrians.

910
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:48,413
This is definitely
gonna end badly.

911
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:53,626
Shut up, Ronnie.

912
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,414
No, you shut up.

913
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:01,092
Shut up, Ronnie!

914
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:04,137
Please stop fighting.

915
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:05,930
Please.

916
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:08,717
Mindy.

917
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:11,557
Mindy.

918
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,401
It's my grandmother.

919
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,689
Oh, god, granny.

920
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,695
- Mindy, mindy.
- No.

921
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:28,825
<i>Mindy, get it together.
It was your grandmother.</i>

922
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:36,128
I can't take this anymore.

923
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:40,423
<i>I can't do it!
I'm done with this nightmare.</i>

924
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,135
Granny, I'm coming.

925
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:46,679
- I'm coming.
- Mindy?

926
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:48,098
No, mindy! No, don't!

927
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:01,986
Holy fuck.

928
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:04,148
God help us.

929
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,355
Centerville.

930
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,320
Usa.

931
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:49,447
A real nice place.

932
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:05,216
What an amusing little machine.

933
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,971
Oh, here's a curious one.

934
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:23,811
Hello there.

935
01:27:25,574 --> 01:27:26,780
Fashion.

936
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:31,985
I can assure you
that is not your tartan.

937
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,119
Nice neck, though.

938
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,558
<i>Come on. I know
a safe place we can hide.</i>

939
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:16,366
Oh, shit.

940
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,619
<i>Is that Danny Perkins?
Over here.</i>

941
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,454
Sure looks like him.

942
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:33,046
I'm sorry, Ronnie, if I've lost it.

943
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:35,849
It's okay, cliff.

944
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,476
But I got to say,

945
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,147
you have been acting a lot different

946
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,772
since all this weird shit
started happening.

947
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,270
What... what are you saying, cliff?

948
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:55,402
I mean, shit.

949
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:01,246
Well, I'm just, you know,
dealing with it in my own way.

950
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:06,000
But I've been telling you
this is all gonna end badly.

951
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:09,128
Goddamn it, Ronnie.

952
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,021
May I ask you a question?

953
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:25,519
Sure. Ask away.

954
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:31,609
You have been saying that
this is all gonna end badly,

955
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,442
from the very beginning,
over and over.

956
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:40,872
So, what made you
so fucking sure of that?

957
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,952
How did you know everything
in advance?

958
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:48,830
Do you really want to know? Yes!

959
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,500
<i>I want to know.
I really want to know!</i>

960
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:55,179
<i>Okay. I know because
I've read the script.</i>

961
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:01,434
You...

962
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:04,433
Read the script.

963
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,145
The whole script?

964
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,320
All of it?

965
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:15,115
Yeah. Jim gave me the whole script.

966
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:20,575
He only gave me our scenes.

967
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,454
I never saw a complete script.

968
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:30,251
After all... I've done for that guy.

969
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:32,754
And it's a lot that
you don't even know about.

970
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:38,217
What a dick.

971
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:18,048
That's weird.

972
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:20,881
They're all leaving.

973
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:46,664
Right. Here we go.

974
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:20,107
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

975
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:23,026
I think I am.

976
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:30,708
Was that in the script?

977
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:32,911
No.

978
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:35,755
Not the one I read.

979
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:23,212
Well, that was unexpected.

980
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:27,428
I knew there was something
unusual about her.

981
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,476
Yeah.

982
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:37,267
So, Ronnie, how does it end, then?

983
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,649
Well...

984
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:46,567
We got to give it our best shot.

985
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:50,822
"Our best shot.” okay. Yeah.

986
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:55,452
But then it ends badly, right?

987
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,289
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it does.

988
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:01,340
Okay, then.

989
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:03,801
Let's do it.

990
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,347
Let's do it.

991
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:39,545
Cliff and little Ronnie.

992
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:42,340
Warriors.

993
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,293
Among the dead.

994
01:34:55,148 --> 01:34:56,148
Zombies.

995
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,726
Remnants of the materialist people.

996
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:09,276
<i>Oh, no, you don't.
No, you don't.</i>

997
01:35:12,999 --> 01:35:15,741
I guess
they've been zombies all along.

998
01:35:17,337 --> 01:35:18,497
Ghosts.

999
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:20,420
Oh, hey, Bobby.

1000
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:24,092
Shit.

1001
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:37,516
"Nameless miseries
of the numberless mortals.”

1002
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:43,605
Frank.

1003
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:45,277
Hey.

1004
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:46,605
You got this coming.

1005
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:53,111
<i>Goodbye, frank.
You reap what you sow.</i>

1006
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:54,946
All right, who's next?

1007
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,417
Ow.

1008
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:02,624
Yuck.

1009
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:07,219
All righty.

1010
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:13,764
Hold your head up.

1011
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,856
Granny.

1012
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:24,893
Mindy would want you
to say hi to grandpa.

1013
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:30,527
Ah, Hank.

1014
01:36:32,412 --> 01:36:33,948
I'm so sorry, brother.

1015
01:36:35,164 --> 01:36:36,574
I just can't do it.

1016
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:39,290
You take care of yourself.

1017
01:36:44,424 --> 01:36:47,291
Danny.

1018
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:48,921
I just saw Hank.

1019
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,512
Ashes to ashes.

1020
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:56,215
Dust to dust.

1021
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:58,643
- Ronnie.
- Mindy!

1022
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:00,394
Cliff.

1023
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,604
- Ronnie.
- No!

1024
01:37:12,035 --> 01:37:13,741
Jesus, Ronnie.

1025
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:32,130
The dead
just don't want to die today.

1026
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:37,640
Reanimated and all jacked up,
just like those ants.

1027
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:41,223
The end of the world.

1028
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:59,746
I guess all them ghost people
plumb lost their goddamn souls.

1029
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:03,700
Must have traded 'em away

1030
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:06,832
or sold 'em for gold or whatnot.

1031
01:38:08,591 --> 01:38:12,175
New trucks, kitchen appliances,

1032
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:16,345
new trousers,
Nintendo game boys,

1033
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,172
shit like that.

1034
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:25,938
Just hungry for more stuff.

1035
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:38,159
Oh, down they go.

1036
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:40,908
The sad end of cliff and Ronnie.

1037
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:51,456
What a fucked-up world.

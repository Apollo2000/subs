1
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:21,226
Dead eyes of the night...

2
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:25,430
...stare at me not!

3
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:01,391
Long ago...

4
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:06,438
our lands were the scene of a great battle.

5
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:14,655
It was a bloody and glorious time.

6
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:24,123
But now, peace reigns in these lands,
and we all enjoy it.

7
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:30,290
Welcome, Wirepa.

8
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:33,423
Your father is not with you?

9
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,134
He apologises...

10
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:39,879
...and sends you his regards.

11
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:44,533
Let us go then...

12
00:03:44,534 --> 00:03:47,604
...to the Place of Bones.

13
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,929
It is noble of you
to listen to your ancestors...

14
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,159
...and seek proper burial for them.

15
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:17,338
We have not hunted or fished
here since the great war...

16
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:24,512
your ancestors have been
honoured all these years.

17
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:28,728
May you find what you seek.

18
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:25,884
Do you still walk here, my ancestors?

19
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:29,831
I will avenge your deaths.

20
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:36,413
You will sing my name...

21
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:39,962
...and of my glory.

22
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:58,648
Welcome me, my noble ancestors.

23
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,377
I have a gift for you.

24
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,706
Sacrilege!

25
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,219
You dare lay hands on a chief's son?

26
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:12,634
Sacrilege!

27
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,103
There in the forest...

28
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:17,267
...your son...

29
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:22,357
...defiling the bones of my ancestors.

30
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:24,378
I saw him!

31
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,698
Did you do what he says?

32
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:28,357
No, Father!

33
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,842
He did it.

34
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:32,594
This is his plan...

35
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:35,414
...to blame us. I know it!

36
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:39,623
When my father finds out...

37
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:42,956
...it will be war.

38
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,292
We are at the edge of a precipice, Lord.

39
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,757
If my son did this act...

40
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:57,475
...then I myself will kill him...

41
00:07:57,954 --> 00:08:01,354
...so that the bond between
our two tribes remains strong.

42
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,234
Father!

43
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:06,191
Be still, fool.

44
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,783
If I sacrifice my son...

45
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:18,453
...to the God of War...

46
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:20,873
...would you consider the balance restored?

47
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:25,666
Will it end your grievance
against me and my kin...

48
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,965
...for now and always?

49
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,716
It is all right, Father.

50
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:39,520
I did not do this thing...

51
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,438
...but I embrace death, if it helps you.

52
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,981
You make me proud that you are mine.

53
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:59,244
Is it at an end?

54
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:04,250
Will his death serve to
bring us together, for all time...

55
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,374
...as witnessed here by us all?

56
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:10,625
Yes?

57
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:15,048
Or is it no?

58
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:23,644
No sacrifice can repair
this insult to my ancestors.

59
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:29,313
You are all responsible,
and my father will hear of it.

60
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:34,867
And when he does...

61
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:43,085
...pray doom does not fall upon your heads.

62
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:54,174
Brave warriors!

63
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:59,471
War feeds our glory...

64
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:04,143
...there is no place for peace.

65
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:28,330
Do you want them followed?

66
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:30,981
We could kill them in their sleep...

67
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:34,086
and feast on their flesh this very night.

68
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:38,056
There has been a desecration.

69
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:45,180
It was likely done by Wirepa himself...

70
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:51,960
...a pretext for what is to come.

71
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:56,214
If his father wants
cause for war, he has it.

72
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:59,740
There is nothing that will stop it now.

73
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:06,960
Finally something honourable
for a warrior to do.

74
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,858
If you were not so stupid, boy...

75
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:18,054
...I would thank you.

76
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,739
I want to be a warrior.

77
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,084
Is it not good to die in a great battle?

78
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:56,376
Does it not honour our ancestors?

79
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:01,446
To the east of here...

80
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:05,973
...lies the place we call the Dead Lands.

81
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:12,230
Once, a great tribe lived there...

82
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:16,070
...but they disappeared.

83
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:22,509
One day they were there, the next...

84
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,011
...they were gone.

85
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:31,870
A land without people, a dead place.

86
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:37,232
I do not want that...

87
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:40,132
...for our tribe.

88
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:12,376
They sigh at us.

89
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:20,128
The dead moan at us from the earth.

90
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:25,556
We can hear them.

91
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:30,827
We must heed their call...

92
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:34,039
...listen to their sighs.

93
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,647
We walk with our dead...

94
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:47,532
...but we don't yet know it.

95
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:15,288
Murder!

96
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,857
Treachery!

97
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:50,674
I underestimated you.

98
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:59,020
You are truly your father's son.

99
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,604
Yes.

100
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:03,725
Before long...

101
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,001
...your tribe will be no more.

102
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:11,357
I will fill your daughter's
uterus with dirt.

103
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:15,908
And that will be your lineage forever...

104
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,704
...dead earth.

105
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,176
Indeed“.

106
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:35,510
...you are a warrior, Tane.

107
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:39,260
You will remember this face.

108
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:43,731
I will stare at you from death...

109
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:47,356
...and wait for you to join me.

110
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:51,864
You, and all here...

111
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,777
...are cursed.

112
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:00,702
Well said.

113
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:06,667
A glorious way to die.

114
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:23,186
Slaughter the rest!

115
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:28,939
We will eat our fill tonight.

116
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,233
We take his head.

117
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:17,817
You are cursed.

118
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:20,327
I pity you.

119
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:28,210
Did you find the boy?

120
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:30,579
No.

121
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:39,847
The boy fled.

122
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:42,515
We leave.

123
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,920
Our men are dead...

124
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:59,168
...and they took your father's head.

125
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:04,548
Where were you, boy?

126
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:06,850
Look...

127
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:11,681
...see what you have done
to our glorious people.

128
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:17,777
Look!

129
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:46,014
What plant is this?

130
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:01,022
Wirepa has our father's head.

131
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,209
Do you understand the lesson?

132
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:26,047
Our ancestors scream at me for repayment.

133
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:34,479
And what can you do?

134
00:22:34,913 --> 00:22:37,766
One against so many?

135
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:43,129
I will get repayment alone...

136
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,949
...or die seeking it.

137
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:52,263
If I could...

138
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:55,038
...I would kill Wirepa myself.

139
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:03,584
But I cannot.

140
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,134
And neither can you.

141
00:23:13,243 --> 00:23:15,892
If I do not return...

142
00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:20,358
...tell stories about me.

143
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:40,503
We will cross here.

144
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:43,419
That way is forbidden.

145
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,316
It goes though the Dead Lands.

146
00:23:45,317 --> 00:23:47,944
So we'll move swiftly, then.

147
00:23:47,945 --> 00:23:51,800
Travelling through the
Dead Lands saves us five days.

148
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:54,430
My lord...

149
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:56,307
...Tahi is right.

150
00:23:57,829 --> 00:24:00,289
Those lands are forbidden...

151
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,860
...we risk the wrath of its spirits.

152
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,363
They say there is...

153
00:24:10,926 --> 00:24:12,278
...a monster.

154
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:15,772
A monster who eats
the flesh of anyone who passes...

155
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:18,242
...who consumed a whole tribe.

156
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,665
What do I care...

157
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:22,917
...of monsters?

158
00:24:23,355 --> 00:24:25,708
Or the dead ancestors of this place?

159
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:29,135
They will marvel at my glory!

160
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:32,430
And the ghosts will hide from us.

161
00:24:37,202 --> 00:24:39,225
Yes, Lord.

162
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:43,475
We go.

163
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:23,659
Come here, boy.

164
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,913
Don't you recognise me?

165
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:35,262
The young have such short memories.

166
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:39,432
I am your grandmother.

167
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,789
I have never spoken with the dead before.

168
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:51,210
I am proud of you.

169
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:52,904
But...

170
00:26:53,797 --> 00:26:56,257
...you are a fool.

171
00:26:56,258 --> 00:27:00,454
What do you think you will do on your own?

172
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:04,306
I will kill Wirepa.

173
00:27:04,307 --> 00:27:07,560
He will kill you.

174
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:09,459
Stupid!

175
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,254
I will not let it be so.

176
00:27:14,818 --> 00:27:17,546
I am my father's son.

177
00:27:22,242 --> 00:27:24,493
Then think, boy...

178
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:28,144
...as your father would have.

179
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:36,656
I know who can help us.

180
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:47,452
The flesh-eating warrior
who haunts these lands.

181
00:27:53,815 --> 00:27:58,011
There is something of your
father in you after all.

182
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,869
Why are you here, little one?

183
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,790
Don't you know men who
come here never leave?

184
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:31,624
I am here to speak with the
warrior who is said to live here.

185
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:34,418
I am a chief.

186
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:36,649
Is that right?

187
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,844
A chief?

188
00:28:58,713 --> 00:29:01,282
Show these witches no fear...

189
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:04,069
...or they will devour you.

190
00:29:04,469 --> 00:29:07,493
They feast on the blood of great warriors.

191
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:14,917
This way, boy.

192
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,002
What you seek is inside.

193
00:29:38,003 --> 00:29:41,448
Enter at your peril.

194
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:03,508
How old are you, boy?

195
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,955
Nearly sixteen seasons.

196
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:17,559
You are a dwarf, then.

197
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:26,110
Even small things can be useful...

198
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:33,201
...and some large things not.

199
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:44,924
You're funny.

200
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:48,581
Perhaps I should hang you above the fire...

201
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:51,643
...keep you as my entertainment.

202
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:55,897
Or a tasty treat.

203
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,648
What do you think?

204
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,822
Nothing?

205
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:11,951
I caught this fellow hunting on my lands.

206
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:15,701
See what I did to him?

207
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:20,748
Why aren't you laughing, boy?

208
00:31:31,533 --> 00:31:33,385
Why are you here?

209
00:31:35,203 --> 00:31:37,101
Tell me...

210
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:39,498
...and I'll decide...

211
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:45,231
...whether to kill you and eat you, or not.

212
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:54,072
I follow a man...

213
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:56,909
...he is called Wirepa.

214
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,145
Even now he walks through your lands...

215
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:03,999
...as if you do not exist.

216
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:17,099
Be quiet!

217
00:32:17,996 --> 00:32:20,474
Mind those wives of mine, boy.

218
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:25,020
You know what they are doing?

219
00:32:25,962 --> 00:32:28,156
They eat these mushrooms...

220
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:32,661
...and their heads fill with visions...

221
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:37,787
...and they talk to the dead.

222
00:32:41,311 --> 00:32:45,291
Finish your story then...

223
00:32:48,151 --> 00:32:52,256
...and we'll see if I eat you.

224
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:08,859
What is it?

225
00:33:10,048 --> 00:33:12,049
A lizard on my staff...

226
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,198
...it is a bad omen.

227
00:33:15,637 --> 00:33:17,705
Or not.

228
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:22,601
I told you we would be cursed.

229
00:33:22,602 --> 00:33:24,394
This is proof.

230
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:27,169
The creature has polluted my weapon.

231
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:30,047
I cannot use it now.

232
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:33,096
We must leave this place.

233
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:36,823
Fool!

234
00:33:36,824 --> 00:33:38,784
It is a genuine omen.

235
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:41,013
We are cursed...

236
00:33:41,704 --> 00:33:43,556
...that is what it says.

237
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,359
You can hear it talk, can you?

238
00:33:55,677 --> 00:33:57,825
Sleep.

239
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:01,223
Tomorrow we move on...

240
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:04,919
...and all will be as before.

241
00:34:15,405 --> 00:34:18,634
The boy reminds you
of your own dishonour...

242
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:21,849
...that much is plain.

243
00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:34,616
You won't escape this life so easily.

244
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:41,096
Until you die, I cannot kill myself.

245
00:34:41,097 --> 00:34:45,794
I am trapped in this dishonour with you.

246
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:50,606
Seeing you suffer...

247
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:55,258
...is the only pleasure left to me.

248
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,899
Help the boy.

249
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,360
Why?

250
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:15,531
Give his blood to your ancestors.

251
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:20,552
Ask their forgiveness...

252
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:24,264
so that you might join them
in the afterlife.

253
00:35:24,265 --> 00:35:26,834
And then we both can die.

254
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:33,086
Stupid woman!

255
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:37,091
You think a dwarf's blood...

256
00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:40,658
will make them forgive me
for what I have done?

257
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:41,929
Yes!

258
00:35:43,076 --> 00:35:46,146
Because he is a prize.

259
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,268
He is a prize!

260
00:35:55,338 --> 00:35:58,738
Because he is everything...

261
00:36:01,177 --> 00:36:03,826
...that you are not.

262
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:19,820
We are going south...

263
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:21,889
...leaving this place.

264
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:27,766
Good.

265
00:36:28,454 --> 00:36:31,774
I do not want to share my glory with you.

266
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,235
Go.

267
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:42,134
Well...

268
00:36:42,135 --> 00:36:44,928
...anyone else want to go with them?

269
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:47,180
No? Then move.

270
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:50,376
There is no glory lying here.

271
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:57,547
I feel there is something wrong,
with these lands.

272
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:03,280
So what of it?

273
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:06,783
The spirits cry at us...

274
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:10,684
...and yet, what can they do?

275
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:13,558
Curse us?

276
00:37:16,878 --> 00:37:21,028
It is they who were cursed...

277
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:26,116
...not us.

278
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:34,768
We should rest.

279
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:40,043
The monster!

280
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:41,144
Run!

281
00:38:44,882 --> 00:38:47,735
The fat one should be slow enough for you!

282
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:07,213
Bravado is pointless...

283
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:10,141
...look where it got you!

284
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:19,851
Ah, the novice.

285
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:22,019
Come here!

286
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:45,650
Die nobly!

287
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:49,346
Come on boy, don't tickle him!

288
00:39:58,205 --> 00:40:00,148
Watch this.

289
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:06,443
Greet your ancestors from me.

290
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,799
You weren't very good today.

291
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:36,677
In fact, you were hopeless.

292
00:40:45,086 --> 00:40:50,113
But next time, you'll be better.

293
00:40:53,928 --> 00:40:57,373
My father was right.

294
00:40:59,058 --> 00:41:01,536
He knew I was no warrior.

295
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,963
You don't say.

296
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:09,509
His death...

297
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,424
...was not a noble one.

298
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:17,886
How else should he have died?

299
00:41:19,537 --> 00:41:23,141
Like an animal,
crawling away in the forest?

300
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:26,986
Is that how a warrior should die?

301
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:32,154
He fought, he died.

302
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:34,443
Noble?

303
00:41:35,136 --> 00:41:38,138
That is what old men teach boys...

304
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:42,517
so they will rush into
death for their tribes.

305
00:41:42,518 --> 00:41:45,542
But death is not noble.

306
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:48,587
Nor is life.

307
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:51,026
If you ask me...

308
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:54,738
...the gods have made this life...

309
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:57,342
...to take pleasure in our suffering.

310
00:42:04,373 --> 00:42:06,350
Tough meat...

311
00:42:10,129 --> 00:42:13,233
...hardly worth the effort.

312
00:42:33,027 --> 00:42:36,097
You are getting worse.

313
00:42:36,363 --> 00:42:39,808
Come, I'll show you something.

314
00:42:41,368 --> 00:42:46,565
Your opponents will thank
you for a cleaner kill.

315
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,232
First...

316
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,983
...make them angry.

317
00:42:57,426 --> 00:43:00,370
They lose focus.

318
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:04,875
Make a joke about their mother...

319
00:43:05,351 --> 00:43:07,169
...that usually works for me.

320
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:10,122
Now, come at me.

321
00:43:14,777 --> 00:43:16,550
Right here.

322
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:21,533
As hard as you can.

323
00:43:21,534 --> 00:43:25,036
Their legs go like runny shit!

324
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:27,356
Then here, see?

325
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:33,146
Always keep the cord around your wrist...

326
00:43:34,421 --> 00:43:37,650
then it won't slip when you come down hard.

327
00:43:39,844 --> 00:43:42,163
You try.

328
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,077
I said do it!

329
00:43:48,435 --> 00:43:50,353
Don't tickle me...

330
00:43:50,354 --> 00:43:52,172
...I don't like it!

331
00:43:53,816 --> 00:43:55,338
Again.

332
00:44:03,492 --> 00:44:06,061
That's better!

333
00:44:06,287 --> 00:44:09,857
Fire in the eyes now, eh boy?

334
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:14,733
You just needed a little encouragement.

335
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:16,947
Again!

336
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:27,533
Not bad.

337
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:31,019
Not very good either...

338
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,215
...but maybe enough.

339
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:39,549
Now sleep.

340
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:43,591
Tomorrow we run all day.

341
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:12,605
Follow me, now.

342
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,557
Move!

343
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:19,398
They're getting away!

344
00:46:19,712 --> 00:46:21,610
That's what you think.

345
00:46:42,818 --> 00:46:44,193
Run.

346
00:46:44,194 --> 00:46:46,388
Remember what I taught you!

347
00:47:14,558 --> 00:47:17,060
Where is the boy?

348
00:47:17,061 --> 00:47:20,005
So you like boys, eh?

349
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:26,903
Before you die...

350
00:47:26,904 --> 00:47:29,598
...the boy's father...

351
00:47:31,075 --> 00:47:33,117
...wishes you well...

352
00:47:33,118 --> 00:47:37,473
...and encourages me to spare you no pain.

353
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,858
Find the boy.

354
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:42,110
Now.

355
00:47:44,463 --> 00:47:46,172
Brave warriors...

356
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:47,741
...get ready!

357
00:47:51,804 --> 00:47:53,451
Where are you?

358
00:47:57,935 --> 00:48:00,003
Kill this dog!

359
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:30,530
It is him!

360
00:48:30,968 --> 00:48:33,821
The monster in the flesh.

361
00:48:36,682 --> 00:48:38,500
Indeed it is.

362
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:08,146
Come, little one.

363
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:12,193
I'll teach you a lesson.

364
00:49:12,676 --> 00:49:14,244
Your mother mates with dogs!

365
00:50:03,435 --> 00:50:05,003
Dog!

366
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:12,779
Move!

367
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:42,058
Is that all you can do?

368
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:47,314
You must earn the right to dispatch us!

369
00:51:55,297 --> 00:51:56,714
He is a demon!

370
00:51:56,715 --> 00:51:58,382
Lord...

371
00:51:58,383 --> 00:52:00,611
...you have been compromised!

372
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,247
Let's go!

373
00:52:14,524 --> 00:52:16,171
Cowards!

374
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:19,839
Hunt what's in front of you, eh?

375
00:52:38,006 --> 00:52:40,029
You can't kill me...

376
00:52:43,345 --> 00:52:46,540
...I'm dead already.

377
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,536
Am I not?

378
00:53:25,512 --> 00:53:27,638
Leave me be!

379
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:29,241
What is it?

380
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,829
They are judging me.

381
00:53:37,524 --> 00:53:39,626
They cannot.

382
00:53:40,068 --> 00:53:43,172
They are my ancestors.

383
00:53:48,535 --> 00:53:53,892
They judge me.

384
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:14,120
Am I not dead?

385
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:17,839
You will live.

386
00:54:47,677 --> 00:54:50,200
What is it, boy?

387
00:54:50,806 --> 00:54:54,058
Why didn't you tell me...

388
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:57,003
...these were your tribe's lands?

389
00:54:57,354 --> 00:54:59,548
What is it to you?

390
00:55:01,191 --> 00:55:03,339
What does it matter at all?

391
00:55:05,612 --> 00:55:08,716
They're all gone.

392
00:55:11,326 --> 00:55:13,895
They are your ancestors...

393
00:55:14,162 --> 00:55:16,455
...you should honour them.

394
00:55:16,456 --> 00:55:19,150
You know nothing.

395
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:23,522
You are the last of your people.

396
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:36,413
Then we are the same, eh?

397
00:55:42,482 --> 00:55:45,609
All I want is Wirepa.

398
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,133
We need to do something.

399
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:51,115
Like what?

400
00:55:51,116 --> 00:55:54,811
We can't catch them now.

401
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,614
We are surrounded by your ancestors.

402
00:56:08,842 --> 00:56:11,411
They will slow Wirepa down.

403
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:16,074
I won't.

404
00:56:17,517 --> 00:56:19,790
You will.

405
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,209
I'm not eating those.

406
00:56:25,442 --> 00:56:27,294
Yes you are.

407
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:31,507
You will talk to your ancestors.

408
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:37,395
Ask them to slow Wirepa down.

409
00:56:38,955 --> 00:56:41,558
Why don't you then...

410
00:56:43,209 --> 00:56:45,403
...if it's such a good idea.

411
00:56:46,254 --> 00:56:48,322
This is your land.

412
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:50,942
These are your ancestors.

413
00:56:55,096 --> 00:56:57,665
Why are you afraid?

414
00:57:06,983 --> 00:57:09,836
They will not speak to me.

415
00:57:17,577 --> 00:57:19,870
If Wirepa gets away...

416
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:23,896
...he will have beaten you as well as me.

417
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:46,355
What difference...

418
00:57:46,356 --> 00:57:49,149
...does it make to you...

419
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,174
...dead things?

420
00:57:56,908 --> 00:58:03,015
They moan, our ancestors...

421
00:58:04,874 --> 00:58:09,104
...they call to us.

422
00:58:10,171 --> 00:58:15,448
The dead are calling...

423
00:58:16,511 --> 00:58:24,611
...pleading for revenge, and we heed them.

424
00:58:49,169 --> 00:58:51,863
Where are you going, you two?

425
00:58:53,506 --> 00:58:56,200
Will they help us?

426
00:59:08,063 --> 00:59:11,212
They already have.

427
00:59:11,483 --> 00:59:15,069
We have angered the
ancestors of this place...

428
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:18,906
...they are punishing us for coming here.

429
00:59:18,907 --> 00:59:23,387
Your fear will not stop my glory.

430
00:59:27,499 --> 00:59:30,148
Do you hear me?

431
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:49,378
He truly is a demon.

432
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:52,795
He is glorious!

433
00:59:53,149 --> 00:59:55,275
You don't deserve to fight him.

434
00:59:55,276 --> 00:59:56,860
Faster.

435
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:58,779
Cursed, are we?

436
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,949
And yet the ground opens up to hide us.

437
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:04,519
Mother earth is alive!

438
01:00:48,788 --> 01:00:50,890
Where are you going, you two?

439
01:00:57,881 --> 01:01:00,304
We were travelling with companions...

440
01:01:00,305 --> 01:01:03,177
but became lost.

441
01:01:03,178 --> 01:01:05,406
You might have seen them?

442
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:11,752
We've seen no one.

443
01:01:14,147 --> 01:01:16,295
You're hurt.

444
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:21,653
My father fell...

445
01:01:21,654 --> 01:01:25,099
but I nursed him back to health.

446
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:31,705
I welcome you, little brother...

447
01:01:31,706 --> 01:01:35,936
to share our camp for the night.

448
01:01:37,879 --> 01:01:41,233
Thank you, we will.

449
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:46,158
He doesn't talk much does he, your father?

450
01:01:51,267 --> 01:01:53,685
What are you doing?

451
01:01:53,686 --> 01:01:56,438
We should kill them.

452
01:01:56,439 --> 01:01:59,858
I've no argument with them.

453
01:01:59,859 --> 01:02:01,902
Then we should leave.

454
01:02:01,903 --> 01:02:06,073
I thought you wanted to find Wirepa.

455
01:02:06,074 --> 01:02:08,742
What does it matter to you?

456
01:02:08,743 --> 01:02:12,188
You said to carry on was hopeless.

457
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:17,644
Why are you sad, little brother?

458
01:02:18,878 --> 01:02:20,946
I miss my family.

459
01:02:22,548 --> 01:02:24,992
But you're with your father.

460
01:02:26,928 --> 01:02:29,872
The rest of my family.

461
01:02:38,356 --> 01:02:41,300
I don't think he is your father.

462
01:02:46,197 --> 01:02:48,049
Yes he is.

463
01:02:49,284 --> 01:02:52,703
Perhaps we should take you back with us.

464
01:02:52,704 --> 01:02:56,149
My father would find out the truth.

465
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:59,482
It would do you no good.

466
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:21,420
I know one thing...

467
01:03:25,111 --> 01:03:28,215
you are indeed a proud and brave warrior.

468
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:34,971
The boy confessed...

469
01:04:34,972 --> 01:04:37,621
you are not his father.

470
01:04:37,934 --> 01:04:39,786
Stupid boy!

471
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:42,959
I might have known.

472
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:50,904
People don't enter the
Dead Lands unless they have to.

473
01:04:50,905 --> 01:04:53,849
Unless they are very desperate.

474
01:05:00,289 --> 01:05:02,916
Why are you here then?

475
01:05:02,917 --> 01:05:06,237
Our own lands are empty of birds.

476
01:05:08,381 --> 01:05:11,234
You should try eating less.

477
01:05:12,927 --> 01:05:16,622
And what is it you want here...

478
01:05:17,515 --> 01:05:19,413
...warrior?

479
01:05:28,484 --> 01:05:30,678
Who are you?

480
01:05:33,364 --> 01:05:35,432
Tell me.

481
01:05:40,663 --> 01:05:43,983
Tell me who it is I'm touching.

482
01:06:00,141 --> 01:06:04,997
So much pain this body has seen.

483
01:06:12,778 --> 01:06:16,865
Has it seen many noble deeds...

484
01:06:16,866 --> 01:06:19,310
...great warrior?

485
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:26,146
Keep going...

486
01:06:27,627 --> 01:06:30,901
and I may yet tell you my name.

487
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:49,753
You bear the mark of the dead tribe.

488
01:06:55,238 --> 01:06:57,557
Don't touch me!

489
01:07:15,216 --> 01:07:17,489
Yes.

490
01:07:19,053 --> 01:07:21,930
Your tribe will be no more.

491
01:07:21,931 --> 01:07:25,285
You will disappear like mist.

492
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:02,363
Come then, monster...

493
01:08:03,097 --> 01:08:06,542
...if it is death you want.

494
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:10,643
Don't! Please!

495
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,713
You should not have come here.

496
01:10:34,999 --> 01:10:36,316
Why?

497
01:10:40,838 --> 01:10:42,656
Why would you do this?

498
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:46,551
What are you, a demon?

499
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:48,950
Are you even a man at all?

500
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:53,542
She would have told them.

501
01:10:55,144 --> 01:10:56,712
What?

502
01:10:57,897 --> 01:11:01,968
That I exist.

503
01:11:03,152 --> 01:11:07,553
They would know I am but a man...

504
01:11:10,326 --> 01:11:13,430
...and come to take my lands.

505
01:11:15,956 --> 01:11:18,104
I know who you are...

506
01:11:19,084 --> 01:11:23,030
...why do you not kill me?

507
01:11:44,902 --> 01:11:47,721
I told you boy...

508
01:11:51,116 --> 01:11:53,639
...I told you.

509
01:11:54,411 --> 01:11:57,789
I was not honourable, I told you!

510
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:00,439
I said we should go!

511
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:03,354
This is your fault.

512
01:12:04,338 --> 01:12:05,338
Liar!

513
01:12:05,339 --> 01:12:08,192
Careful, boy.

514
01:12:12,721 --> 01:12:14,619
You're an animal!

515
01:12:15,891 --> 01:12:22,215
Not noble enough for you?

516
01:12:23,065 --> 01:12:25,714
Not like you are.

517
01:12:25,901 --> 01:12:29,737
My father taught me honour.

518
01:12:29,738 --> 01:12:32,717
You should restore your own.

519
01:12:33,742 --> 01:12:37,245
And where is your father now?

520
01:12:37,246 --> 01:12:41,067
Where your people are.

521
01:12:48,424 --> 01:12:53,496
You want to know about honour, boy?

522
01:12:59,727 --> 01:13:03,877
My father asked me...

523
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,511
...to slay my whole family.

524
01:13:10,112 --> 01:13:12,715
My wife...

525
01:13:15,326 --> 01:13:18,600
...my children.

526
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:23,059
As repayment to an enemy.

527
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:27,128
I did it, to honour him...

528
01:13:27,129 --> 01:13:30,153
...and my tribe.

529
01:13:35,346 --> 01:13:38,890
But the world is not honourable, boy.

530
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:43,417
Did the betrayal of your
father teach you nothing?

531
01:13:45,064 --> 01:13:47,508
Do you hear me?

532
01:13:48,567 --> 01:13:52,513
There is no nobility, just politics.

533
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:01,643
So...

534
01:14:07,252 --> 01:14:11,482
...I killed everybody else, too.

535
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:23,351
I killed them all...

536
01:14:23,352 --> 01:14:25,625
in the night.

537
01:14:27,564 --> 01:14:30,588
While they slept.

538
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:38,559
That is why people fear me.

539
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:45,350
The monster who killed his own tribe.

540
01:14:52,548 --> 01:14:55,572
Do you hear me?

541
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,158
Do you hear?

542
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:06,329
I admit it!

543
01:15:12,192 --> 01:15:16,362
I have a blackness that comes upon me...

544
01:15:16,363 --> 01:15:20,969
where even the
God of War would not venture.

545
01:15:26,749 --> 01:15:30,820
I've done many bad things.

546
01:15:33,547 --> 01:15:35,991
I told you...

547
01:15:36,759 --> 01:15:40,204
do not mistake me for a good man.

548
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,580
I am not the hero from the stories.

549
01:15:54,693 --> 01:15:57,546
I am the monster.

550
01:16:49,998 --> 01:16:56,026
You've clone well so far, eh boy?

551
01:16:59,925 --> 01:17:02,824
You're still alive.

552
01:17:04,805 --> 01:17:07,829
I have failed.

553
01:17:09,935 --> 01:17:12,629
Wirepa got away.

554
01:17:14,189 --> 01:17:17,042
Well, you can give up...

555
01:17:18,277 --> 01:17:21,597
...anyone can give up.

556
01:17:22,406 --> 01:17:24,258
I didn't say I was giving up.

557
01:17:26,285 --> 01:17:28,308
That's good.

558
01:17:35,711 --> 01:17:39,861
I want repayment for
what happened to my son...

559
01:17:42,009 --> 01:17:45,454
and you are the only one who can get it.

560
01:18:36,396 --> 01:18:39,966
Why do you stare at me?

561
01:18:43,779 --> 01:18:46,553
What right do you have...

562
01:18:47,741 --> 01:18:50,344
to stare at me?

563
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,444
How dare you?

564
01:19:00,003 --> 01:19:02,652
Sigh at me not!

565
01:20:01,106 --> 01:20:05,302
I have something to show you.

566
01:20:15,537 --> 01:20:16,637
There...

567
01:20:17,539 --> 01:20:18,639
...see it?

568
01:20:20,167 --> 01:20:23,612
There will be more flesh tonight.

569
01:20:26,214 --> 01:20:30,990
Now we can settle up.

570
01:20:52,449 --> 01:20:53,657
They will see it.

571
01:20:53,658 --> 01:20:55,351
Fool!

572
01:20:55,577 --> 01:20:57,679
You talk of fools?

573
01:20:59,748 --> 01:21:03,352
Who set the ancestors
of this land against us?

574
01:21:06,671 --> 01:21:08,569
And dragged us through it...

575
01:21:09,674 --> 01:21:11,196
with empty bellies!

576
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,377
He's a fool...

577
01:21:26,191 --> 01:21:28,009
but no need to kill him.

578
01:21:28,777 --> 01:21:31,380
Why are we here?

579
01:21:33,156 --> 01:21:35,241
You could not go on...

580
01:21:35,242 --> 01:21:37,368
...so we took shelter.

581
01:21:37,369 --> 01:21:39,096
It's defendable.

582
01:21:48,505 --> 01:21:50,653
Are you ready to travel?

583
01:22:08,817 --> 01:22:11,386
Fight him when you control the ground.

584
01:22:19,536 --> 01:22:20,637
Back inside the fort!

585
01:22:33,633 --> 01:22:35,030
Cowards!

586
01:22:38,513 --> 01:22:40,331
It was glory you wanted.

587
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:42,784
Come then...

588
01:22:44,603 --> 01:22:47,547
and I will tell stories
about how brave you were.

589
01:22:48,273 --> 01:22:52,344
Instead of hiding
behind a fence like cowards!

590
01:23:03,955 --> 01:23:08,185
Look upon your son, Tane.

591
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:12,379
The weeping dwarf...

592
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,574
who caused your tribe's suffering.

593
01:23:34,819 --> 01:23:36,887
You are funny.

594
01:23:37,155 --> 01:23:39,428
So brave, eh...

595
01:23:39,783 --> 01:23:42,853
...behind a fence?

596
01:23:44,663 --> 01:23:47,812
Behind my fence.

597
01:24:09,062 --> 01:24:10,162
Glory...

598
01:24:10,897 --> 01:24:12,273
...or death.

599
01:24:12,274 --> 01:24:13,876
Either way...

600
01:24:14,526 --> 01:24:17,425
...you'll make a handsome corpse, eh boy?

601
01:24:18,905 --> 01:24:22,430
We will die here without water.

602
01:24:23,285 --> 01:24:24,952
Be still.

603
01:24:24,953 --> 01:24:27,226
It's only been a day.

604
01:24:27,664 --> 01:24:29,641
Just one day, yes...

605
01:24:33,211 --> 01:24:35,439
but my mouth is filled
with nothing but dust!

606
01:24:37,882 --> 01:24:39,842
Mana is right.

607
01:24:39,843 --> 01:24:41,635
We have no supplies.

608
01:24:41,636 --> 01:24:44,159
You have put us in a trap.

609
01:24:44,347 --> 01:24:47,641
Remember your place.

610
01:24:47,642 --> 01:24:50,416
So it's our place...

611
01:24:51,313 --> 01:24:53,586
...to die of thirst?

612
01:24:54,733 --> 01:24:57,382
They have no food or water.

613
01:24:57,777 --> 01:24:59,845
We have them.

614
01:25:01,448 --> 01:25:03,050
Your quest for glory...

615
01:25:04,659 --> 01:25:06,136
...where has it led us?

616
01:25:07,662 --> 01:25:10,060
Into this trap...

617
01:25:11,791 --> 01:25:13,885
...from which there is no escape!

618
01:25:13,886 --> 01:25:17,777
We wither here until
the demon sees fit to consume us.

619
01:25:18,465 --> 01:25:19,908
Settle down!

620
01:25:28,433 --> 01:25:29,600
Come and look...

621
01:25:29,601 --> 01:25:33,080
You are not your father.

622
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:36,440
Lord...

623
01:25:36,441 --> 01:25:38,168
You are a fool!

624
01:25:42,656 --> 01:25:44,508
There!

625
01:25:45,283 --> 01:25:47,727
Let his blood sustain us.

626
01:26:01,466 --> 01:26:02,658
Lord...

627
01:26:04,219 --> 01:26:05,866
...look.

628
01:26:15,563 --> 01:26:17,506
What did I tell you?

629
01:26:18,149 --> 01:26:21,719
The ancestors of this place choose me.

630
01:26:33,957 --> 01:26:36,151
I will make the boy's head...

631
01:26:36,543 --> 01:26:38,111
a match with his father's.

632
01:26:40,839 --> 01:26:44,383
The gods smile on me...

633
01:26:44,384 --> 01:26:47,533
and I am like a son to them.

634
01:26:58,231 --> 01:26:59,457
There!

635
01:27:45,278 --> 01:27:47,051
My warriors...

636
01:27:47,197 --> 01:27:48,549
...we leave!

637
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,567
There!

638
01:28:06,966 --> 01:28:08,675
Cowards!

639
01:28:08,676 --> 01:28:10,198
Come, boy...

640
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:13,703
...time to claim what's yours.

641
01:28:20,814 --> 01:28:22,507
Come on, boy!

642
01:28:38,832 --> 01:28:40,980
Stupid boy!

643
01:29:05,733 --> 01:29:08,552
You're afraid, aren't you.

644
01:29:11,322 --> 01:29:13,156
I am so glorious...

645
01:29:13,157 --> 01:29:15,476
that is what you're in awe of.

646
01:29:35,221 --> 01:29:37,598
The monster's spirit...

647
01:29:37,599 --> 01:29:40,873
and these dead lands have possessed you.

648
01:29:41,144 --> 01:29:43,246
So be it.

649
01:29:45,148 --> 01:29:46,295
No mercy!

650
01:30:35,698 --> 01:30:37,175
Come on, boy!

651
01:30:40,161 --> 01:30:42,730
You're embarrassing me!

652
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:48,062
Put up a decent fight!

653
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:32,916
I am your better...

654
01:32:34,233 --> 01:32:36,677
and now you know it.

655
01:32:53,294 --> 01:32:55,253
Pick it up, demon...

656
01:32:55,254 --> 01:32:58,073
I will honour you with a good death.

657
01:33:32,458 --> 01:33:34,435
Go!

658
01:33:35,002 --> 01:33:37,355
Go to your father.

659
01:33:55,898 --> 01:33:59,192
You are a fool to honour me.

660
01:33:59,193 --> 01:34:01,967
Tell the dead...

661
01:34:03,364 --> 01:34:06,434
...I am coming.

662
01:34:35,813 --> 01:34:39,133
The demon is but a man, after all.

663
01:34:40,651 --> 01:34:42,094
No!

664
01:35:20,233 --> 01:35:23,132
Glorious...

665
01:35:23,444 --> 01:35:27,014
...as your father before you.

666
01:35:30,868 --> 01:35:33,912
You will pay for the
slaughter of my family.

667
01:35:33,913 --> 01:35:36,581
As it should be!

668
01:35:36,582 --> 01:35:40,377
Your father will be proud...

669
01:35:40,378 --> 01:35:43,948
...just as mine is proud of me.

670
01:35:45,466 --> 01:35:48,536
Tell them how I met death.

671
01:35:48,803 --> 01:35:49,928
Promise me!

672
01:35:49,929 --> 01:35:52,138
And if I do...

673
01:35:52,139 --> 01:35:54,082
what then?

674
01:35:56,852 --> 01:36:00,627
Your kin will seek
repayment for your death.

675
01:36:01,691 --> 01:36:06,236
They will tell of our glory...

676
01:36:06,237 --> 01:36:09,906
and remember us in stories.

677
01:36:09,907 --> 01:36:12,681
You didn't have to kill them all!

678
01:36:15,454 --> 01:36:19,058
How could I live with the dishonour...

679
01:36:19,583 --> 01:36:24,314
of my kin lying unburied?

680
01:36:25,673 --> 01:36:28,868
I have given them glory.

681
01:36:30,344 --> 01:36:35,541
Just as you will do when you kill me.

682
01:36:37,101 --> 01:36:39,829
So it goes, then...

683
01:36:42,815 --> 01:36:45,964
around in circles.

684
01:36:50,281 --> 01:36:53,260
When you think of me...

685
01:36:54,368 --> 01:36:57,120
you will remember how I spared you.

686
01:36:57,121 --> 01:37:00,020
And that forever...

687
01:37:00,624 --> 01:37:03,543
you owe me a debt.

688
01:37:03,544 --> 01:37:07,274
The debt lies with you...

689
01:37:08,799 --> 01:37:11,259
...your father...

690
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:13,613
...and your tribe.

691
01:37:13,929 --> 01:37:15,952
For all time.

692
01:37:17,683 --> 01:37:19,911
Do you swear?

693
01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:24,923
Swear.

694
01:37:28,736 --> 01:37:30,153
Say it!

695
01:37:30,154 --> 01:37:32,131
I swear.

696
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:34,783
On your honour...

697
01:37:34,784 --> 01:37:36,886
and that of your father.

698
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:39,597
I swear it.

699
01:37:41,207 --> 01:37:44,902
Then the ancestors of this place...

700
01:37:45,586 --> 01:37:48,405
are my witness.

701
01:38:28,838 --> 01:38:31,191
Stupid boy...

702
01:38:35,094 --> 01:38:39,745
...let me die in peace.

703
01:38:44,019 --> 01:38:48,295
I can see them, boy...

704
01:38:52,695 --> 01:38:56,425
...my ancestors.

705
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:02,146
They reject me.

706
01:39:02,955 --> 01:39:11,055
They banish me from the afterlife.

707
01:39:15,759 --> 01:39:19,739
I have nowhere to go now.

708
01:39:24,643 --> 01:39:28,293
You will be welcomed by my ancestors.

709
01:39:28,481 --> 01:39:31,191
Do you hear me?

710
01:39:31,192 --> 01:39:34,762
They will lead you into the afterlife.

711
01:39:36,071 --> 01:39:40,017
And we will speak of you in stories.

712
01:39:42,286 --> 01:39:45,731
Speak of your honour.

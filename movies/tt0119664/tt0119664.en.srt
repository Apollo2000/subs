2
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:48,408
Backtrack starting to make up good yardage.
He's closing on the outside.

3
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,579
They run past the quarter pole, and cozy
girl is gone clear by three lengths.

4
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,448
Now, backtrack coming up.
Come on, cozy girl. Come on, cozy girl!

5
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,851
He's gonna be a
danger to cozy girl.

6
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,187
They come for home.
Cozy girl is clear by two.

7
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,424
114 to roper. Come
on, dig in, cozy girl. Dig in!

8
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:08,494
Roper here. 114, roper. Code two, C.
P., 4th and grand.

9
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,532
Backtrack is catching
stride for stride on the outside.

10
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,669
Come on, cozy girl! E. T. A. In five.
I'm en route! Cozy girl is tenacious,

11
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,505
but backtrack keeps on
making up ground on her.

12
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,308
Cozy girl and backtrack! Gonna
be a tight photo in this one.

13
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:27,447
Come on, cozy baby! Break the wire!
Here's the wire!

14
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,584
Come on. Come on, cozy girl. Come on, cozy
girl. It's so close between those two,

15
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,586
cozy girl! Cozy girl!
But backtrack has won it...

16
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,855
In a nose over cozy girl!
Cozy girl, you lazy bitch!

17
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:38,491
Backtrack wins. Cozy girl second.
You lazy, hag-ass bitch!

18
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:42,195
That cozy shit is why we lost
this race, being fuckin' cozy!

19
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,731
You need to get the fire
under your ass!

20
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,745
Move in.
All the way.

21
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,585
Clear!
Take position!

22
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,653
I'm all right.

23
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,256
I got this one. Bar windows.

24
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,516
I'm 97 at the inner perimeter.

25
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,585
No, no, communications are down.
He ripped the phone out.

26
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,821
Yeah, yeah, he's here now.
Got it.

27
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,790
Hey, Scott. Hey, Eiko,
where's the command post?

28
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,926
It's down here. Hey, Bob, I
need two guys to go to C. P.

29
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:49,395
Now what's going on? Suspect came
in shortly after the bank opened.

30
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,898
Botched robbery.
Teller hit the silent alarm.

31
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,636
He's taken 17 hostages, shot one,
the guard. He's still alive.

32
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,638
So far, he's asked for a... car.

33
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,873
And a plane waiting at the airport.
And if he doesn't get that...

34
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,275
He'll kill all the hostages
in five minutes. Right.

35
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,745
What's the suspect's name? Earl.

36
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,681
Earl. Shit, you'd think
on a day like today,

37
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,650
Earl would go to the park
or something, right?

38
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,253
Ladies and gentlemen. What's up, man?
Scott.

39
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,689
Hey. Roper, glad
you could make it.

40
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,691
Captain Solis is
on his way down.

41
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,294
You guys got a profile on Earl?
Yeah.

42
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,599
This guy's no genius. They ain't
usually graduate students.

43
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,269
SWAT wants to go in. What, they
ain't killed nobody yet this week?

44
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,605
Okay, we got a guy
who's probably on drugs.

45
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:35,008
He's got a record of 459s.
He's been busted on possession.

46
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,545
Never been busted on a major felony.
What's this guy's demeanor?

47
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,481
He's a little fuckin' agitated.
He ripped the phone out.

48
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:45,619
I gotta go face-to-face.
No. I don't think so.

49
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,989
Sam, you got a building full of hostages.
One of them is hurt, we don't know how bad.

50
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:52,325
This nut pulled out the telephone. SWAT
said he had a gun to somebody's head.

51
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,895
If SWAT goes in there, you're gonna
lose one person, possibly two.

52
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:58,031
You gotta let me go in there, look around
and make sure everything's all right.

53
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,901
I don't know. Sam, look
at the guy's rap sheet.

54
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,537
There's no violence on there.
The guy's never offed anybody.

55
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,507
Hey, look, are you gonna
let me go in there...

56
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,710
Or we gonna stand around and talk
and let this guy bleed to death?

57
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,347
Can I have a dozen
doughnuts, please?

58
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:26,326
What makes a
guy do something like that?

59
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,494
Give me a roof
and a rifle any day.

60
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,825
C.P., I see a W.M.A.
In window three...

61
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,862
Holding a handgun
to Asian female's head.

62
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,765
Suspect is wearing
a black vest and t-shirt.

63
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,969
I'm gonna kill somebody! If they don't give
me my goddamn car, I'm gonna kill somebody!

64
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,742
Who the fuck are you, man?
Hey, how you doing, Earl.

65
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,912
I'm Scott roper, the negotiator. Get up!
Get up! Get up where I can see you!

66
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,448
Hands up! Get back! Get back!
Stop right there, motherfucker!

67
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:29,556
Hands up!
Hands up! Get back!

68
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,794
Get back! Step back!
Stop right there, man!

69
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,630
Stop. Okay, Earl. All right.
I'm stopping.

70
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,400
All right, turn around. I don't carry
a weapon, Earl. I'm a negotiator.

71
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,402
I have no gun. See?
Keep your hands up!

72
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,506
I'm just pattin' down, pattin'
down for you. Hands up!

73
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,774
All right?

74
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,910
What's in the hand, man?
What's in the bag?

75
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,045
These are doughnuts, Earl. I know
y'all been in here for awhile,

76
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:55,148
so I brought some doughnuts in case
anybody wanted a snack or something.

77
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,483
Drop the fuckin' bag!
Drop the bag.

78
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,620
Okay, no problem.
I'll put the doughnuts down.

79
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,688
It's just doughnuts,
okay, Earl? Relax.

80
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,690
Kick 'em over!
Okay.

81
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,560
Hands up! Goddamn it, let me see you!

82
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,930
Kick it over, man.
Kick it over!

83
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,198
Pick it up.
Pick it up! Pick it up!

84
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,101
Open the bag! Show me
what's in the bag! Open it!

85
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,875
It's doughnuts, man. That's what I said,
man. I told you they were doughnuts.

86
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,545
This is bullshit, man!
You poisoning that shit!

87
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,813
You put fuckin' powdered shit in it, man!
Earl, no, no.

88
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,716
You're fuckin' with me! No, Earl.
Look, I'm not playing with you.

89
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,818
They're just doughnuts.
Eat it! Eat one!

90
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,721
Please, eat. Don't
even worry about the doughnuts.

91
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,990
Eat the doughnut!
Let them eat 'em.

92
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,725
See?
Where's my fucking car, man?

93
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,795
I'm getting you your car, but first
things first. All right, Earl?

94
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,999
<i>We have to do this thing right.
All right? Okay, Earl?</i>

95
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,935
I want you to take that gun and point
it away from... what's your name, miss?

96
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,639
Debbie. You point that gun
away from Debbie's head, okay?

97
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,576
Debbie's fuckin' brains are gonna
be all over the floor in five minutes,

98
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,578
you don't give me my car, man!
No, Earl.

99
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,680
That's the worse thing you can do.

100
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,682
That's a really bad move
if you do that.

101
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:05,218
Okay? Let's be clear
about something.

102
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,488
If you kill anybody,
I can't help you.

103
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:12,593
No, please, god, no. All right? I can't
help you. The rules of the game change.

104
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,862
SWAT will
take you out if you kill somebody.

105
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,064
That's what they gear up for.
No. Please, no.

106
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,166
They're ready
to do you right now.

107
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,936
I want you to see something.
Come here.

108
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,138
Just look...
Just look out the window here.

109
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,774
Look across the street.

110
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,076
There's a sniper in the window.

111
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,179
He's looking at you right now
in the scope on his rifle.

112
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,816
The window next to it...
Sniper in there too.

113
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:40,687
Oh, shit, man. Fuck. All around the
building, you got SWAT on the roof.

114
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,056
Fuck, man. And they've
been given the word.

115
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:48,562
If you kill anybody...
Anybody... they take you out.

116
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,898
And they don't give a shit. They'll take
you out and go right to lunch, okay?

117
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:56,937
Fuck! Fuck, man. Fuck.

118
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:00,006
What are my chances, man?

119
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,042
Not bad.

120
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,212
You know, last month somebody robbed a bank
in Daly city. He made it to the freeway.

121
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,882
Cops gave him a car, he got on
the freeway and he lost 'em.

122
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,685
Really?
But they didn't kill anybody.

123
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:15,155
Hmm? How you doing, Harold?

124
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,824
Hey, what are you doing to that man?
Okay, Earl.

125
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,694
I gotta take Harold outta here.
He's bleeding pretty bad.

126
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:23,096
I took an oath as a negotiator.

127
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,299
If I ever go into a hostile situation
and there's an injured party,

128
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,969
I'm duty-bound by that oath
to take the person to safety.

129
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,573
You can shoot me if you want, but the next
negotiator is gonna tell you the same thing.

130
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,775
Just give me my car, man.
All right? Give me my car.

131
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,711
Everybody, everything's gonna be all right.
We're gonna get everybody outta here.

132
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,647
Okay? You give me my car!
I'll do her, man!

133
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,616
I fuckin' swear! I'm not fuckin' around!
We'll get you your car.

134
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,052
All right? And Earl, Earl, take
that gun down from Debbie's head.

135
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,855
Don't mess with me. Don't fuck with me,
man. You don't want any accidents.

136
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,693
Everything's gonna be cool.
Give me my car, man!

137
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,294
Don't kill me!
Shut up!

138
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,129
Come on!

139
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,299
Hold your fire!
Let's go! Let's go!

140
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,105
That's one out.
Seventeen to go.

141
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,975
Okay, Harold, here you go.

142
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,978
Give me your gun.
What?

143
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,848
Give me your gun.

144
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,987
I haven't had to shoot
anybody in three years.

145
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,925
Why not keep the streak alive? 'Cause this
strung-out junkie's gonna kill somebody.

146
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,795
What the hell are
you doing out there? What's goin' on?

147
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,634
Okay, Earl, it's happening.

148
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:37,237
Got your car comin'. Harold's gone
to safety. Everything is cool.

149
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,405
We're gonna get
everybody out of here.

150
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:43,143
But first, as a show of good
faith, give me another hostage.

151
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,178
Give me Debbie. I gave you
the old fuckin' man, man!

152
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,981
He don't count, man. He was bleeding.
He was gonna die in here.

153
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,250
That would have been on your ass. I did
you a favor taking him outta here.

154
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,653
Now give me a hostage.
Give me Debbie.

155
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,154
Am I gettin' my car, man?

156
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:56,890
You're gonna get your car, but give
me a hostage. Give me Debbie, man.

157
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,427
Take them, man!
Take 'em!

158
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:05,031
Take 'em! Take them! Take them!
Okay, you three, let's go.

159
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,934
Go!

160
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,070
Please don't kill me.

161
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,707
Please don't. I see we're making progress.
We're gonna get everybody out.

162
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,842
Everybody relax. I'm gonna get your
car right now. Get me my car, man.

163
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,377
You'll get your car right now.
Give me my car, man.

164
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,880
I'll get your car.
Oh, there's one other thing.

165
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,248
What? What?

166
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,985
You want a hardtop or a convertible?
Fuck, man.

167
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,788
A fuckin' hardtop, man.
Hardtop. Hardtop, man.

168
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,056
Hardtop.
All right.

169
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,128
Manual or automatic?
Automatic.

170
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,902
Stay down!
Don't you fuckin' move!

171
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,337
Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me!
I give up, man!

172
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,774
Everybody down!
On the floor!

173
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,746
Don't shoot me, man! Don't shoot me!

174
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,281
On the floor!

175
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,085
Don't shoot! Don't shoot, man!
Don't shoot! Don't...

176
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,054
Captain Solis, can
we speak to inspector roper?

177
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,123
Captain Solis!
Inspector roper!

178
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,394
Please, hold your questions. You successfully
negotiated nine times in the past.

179
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,732
What was different about this situation?
Please, ladies and gentlemen,

180
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,400
the inspector is not available
to answer your questions now.

181
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,971
We're just very thankful nobody got killed in
this incident. Can't you give us something?

182
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,874
The inspector will be available to
answer your questions in two hours...

183
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:23,744
At the official police briefing at police
headquarters. Inspector roper, are you okay?

184
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,879
Are you okay, inspector?
I'm fine.

185
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,881
Please, please.
We have no further...

186
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,250
Hey.

187
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,020
That is one for the front page. What are you
doing coming down here and torturing me?

188
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,757
You know I'm in love with you.
Don't start.

189
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,859
Don't tell me not to start.
Look, Ronnie.

190
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,862
That baseball player you're running
around with; That guy is bad news.

191
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:45,465
Really? Let's think about this. He makes
two million a year. Really nice guy.

192
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,901
And he worships me.
I worship you too.

193
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:52,172
Scott, you worship your bookie. No,
forget that. What's this guy's name?

194
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,241
Greg. Well, I read that
Greg's knees are blown out.

195
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:59,145
Ten years, you're pushin' him around in a
wheelchair. Lot of hills in this town.

196
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:04,851
You know what I think? I think you only
want me back... Because you can't have me.

197
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,555
Well, I don't think it matters what you think.
What matters is I think we should be together.

198
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:12,959
Hey, hey, hey, listen to me. Can
we please go out this weekend?

199
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:15,295
No way.
And talking of going out...

200
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,865
What about Troy? You told me you'd
take him out over a month ago?

201
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,168
Veronica, I had a rough month. I
know I was supposed to get with him.

202
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:26,573
He misses you. I tell him you're coming around
and his eyes light up, then you don't...

203
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:30,110
Now why you wanna lay all this
guilt on me, huh? Look, Saturday.

204
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,013
We'll get together on Saturday; Me,
you and Troy, we'll go to the park.

205
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,349
We'll have the most beautiful day. One
big, happy family. No, no. You and Troy.

206
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:40,486
We spend enough time together.
Troy needs a man in his life.

207
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:43,590
And besides, I'm seeing
Greg on Saturday.

208
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,527
What do you mean you're
"going out with Greg on Saturday"?

209
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:50,330
You're gonna go out with Greg and I'm
supposed to go with Troy to the park?

210
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,566
That's a little tacky.
Tacky?

211
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,570
Yes, that's tacky. And it's gonna
confuse Troy. You don't think so?

212
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,341
Can I drive you to the paper so we can talk
about this? Please, can I drive you? Huh?

213
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,577
Hey!

214
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:08,314
Hey! Hey, that's my car!

215
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:13,419
Not anymore! Now it belongs
to silver hills financial!

216
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,633
Good work today, Scott.
Thank you, inspector.

217
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:30,203
I needed it two days ago.
How we doin' for tonight?

218
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,639
Two on the floor.
You're my hero.

219
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,642
Dinner's on you. You got yourself a deal.
I gotta meet with Solis.

220
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:39,045
Okay, go get him.
Later on.

221
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,590
Absolutely. Yes, sir.
I agree with you 100 percent.

222
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,527
Yeah, he just walked into my office. Chief says,
"good job this morning. Congratulations."

223
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:57,430
Tell him to give me a raise then.
He said, "thank you very much."

224
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:59,666
That's not what I said.
Yes, sir.

225
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,235
Yes, sir, I'll discuss it
with him right now.

226
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,205
Yes, sir.
Good-bye, chief.

227
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:08,208
Roper.
What?

228
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,911
It has been decided that you
will take on a new partner...

229
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,446
And train him to be able
to take over for you.

230
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:16,382
Is that why you got this guy in the Sunday
school outfit sitting out here in the lobby?

231
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,953
His name is Kevin McCall.
Oh, Captain.

232
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,122
Every Metro Captain agrees
he's their best sharpshooter...

233
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:25,659
And the most likely to succeed.

234
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,961
This is bullshit, Captain.

235
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:33,466
Tested high on his intellectual
aptitude, didn't he?

236
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:36,469
Not as high as me, but pretty high.
That's true.

237
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,540
National marksman's finalist,
attended NYC, went to college.

238
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,342
Very impressive.
FBI sniper school.

239
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,978
Mayoral commendation.

240
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:48,214
Additional skills: Biathlete,
marathoner, lip-reading.

241
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,588
This is great. Why don't you
send this guy to the marines?

242
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:58,324
He's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two
weeks. You let me worry about that.

243
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,361
Well, I hope there's gonna be some kind
of expression of y'all's appreciation...

244
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,363
If I gotta hang out
with Huck Finn over there.

245
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,601
What, uh... what kind of
appreciation did you have in mind?

246
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,704
Honestly?

247
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,706
Five thousand dollars.

248
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,315
Okay, I can do that.
And a car.

249
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,719
I'm not giving you a goddamned car.
I just gave you a $5,000 raise.

250
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,088
Get your own damn car. Come on, Captain.
I've been down to impound.

251
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:30,757
I saw what you got there. You got a beautiful
black Benz just sittin' there right now.

252
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,393
Nobody's doin' nothin'.
Impound is not a rent-a-car company.

253
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,629
The car's part of the deal.
I don't have a car.

254
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,765
Well, what the hell happened to
your trans am? They repoed my shit.

255
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,568
Look, I'm not promising you nothing,
but I'll see what I can do.

256
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,604
Look, do what you can.

257
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,107
Oh, and I get to keep all the money even if
this guy quits 'cause SWAT guys don't have...

258
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,011
The temperament or the background for
what I do, you know what I'm sayin'?

259
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,447
How you doin', man? I'm lookin'
forward to working with you.

260
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:57,183
You'll be good. You've got a lot
of hard work in front of you.

261
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,186
I'm up to it. Don't worry, I'll
be around longer than two weeks.

262
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:03,289
So, don't, don't worry
about that, okay?

263
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,394
Hey, man, don't be readin' my lips and
shit. You save that for sniper school.

264
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,764
Okay, well, don't worry about what I'm
gonna do for the next weeks, okay?

265
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,766
Gentlemen,
can we move past this?

266
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,636
We got past it. We're getting
acquainted with each other. I'm fine.

267
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:18,639
Well, I think that's very nice. Now, if you
both excuse me, I do have other work to do.

268
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:20,707
My bad. We're gone.
Thank you, Captain.

269
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,709
Roper?
Sir?

270
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,779
About the transportation issue?
See the impound sergeant.

271
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:30,083
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

272
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:33,086
So, you ever been in a hostage situation?
Only at the very end.

273
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,256
Yeah, what did you feel like after the
shooting? Like it had to be done.

274
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,726
It very rarely has to be done. And
I've very rarely shot anyone.

275
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,362
Yeah, well, SWAT is a lifesaving unit.
Remember that.

276
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,365
Now I know that, okay? You know,
you know a lot. You're a wiseass.

277
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,634
No, excuse me? You heard what I said.
You're a wiseass.

278
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:52,372
And I got a special little test for
first-day wiseasses here. Look.

279
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,775
I want you to get this cap
out of the bottle... Sure.

280
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,777
Without touching, without
destroying the bottle. Okay.

281
00:17:56,877 --> 00:17:59,112
Okay, don't move it.
And what's the point?

282
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01,381
It's a little test
in lateral thinking.

283
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,584
The obvious solution isn't always
the only solution. You got options.

284
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:08,354
Use your head. Use your mind.
Don't break the bottle. Okay.

285
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,356
Have a nice day.
Okay.

286
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,392
No touching!

287
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,099
Hey, don't look at me.
I went to public school.

288
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,568
Right. Great.
Thank you.

289
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,638
Mind if we make a stop
on the way?

290
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,240
We busted Frank Antonucci
on possession.

291
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,375
He gave us a lead on
the Polk street jewelry heist.

292
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,377
Phony Frank?
Don't waste your time.

293
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:35,749
That guy'd finger his firstborn to
dodge a collar. I still got to do it.

294
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:39,252
Wasting time is half my job.
Yeah, all right.

295
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:42,122
You know, I think that SWAT guy
might be a good idea.

296
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,692
May take a little pressure off you.
I'm beginning to worry about you.

297
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,528
Where is... what are you
worryin' about me for?

298
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:51,397
I saw you talkin' to Ronnie this morning. I
don't know why you can't get it back together?

299
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,768
Ah! I mean, you got to be out of
your mind not to get with that one.

300
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:57,771
What are you talking about?
It's not me. It's her.

301
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,473
She's goin' out with some baseball
player named Greg Barnett.

302
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,475
No kiddin'?
Mm.

303
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,746
Get out of here.
That boy can hit... and run.

304
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:08,882
And throw!

305
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,153
Why don't you just get some pom-poms and start
chanting, "Greg, Greg, Greg." Fuck him!

306
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,858
What is wrong with this car door?

307
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,595
Come on, man.
Give me the keys.

308
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:24,264
There's no alarm on those.

309
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:28,635
Hey, y'all got a spare key so I can
get to this kill switch in here...

310
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,637
And turn this shit off?

311
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:35,742
This shit is bad. You hear me, Sam?
This is some bad shit.

312
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,744
Rope, this is it.

313
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,247
This is too fly.
This is it.

314
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,450
What?
This is it. This is your ride.

315
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,323
No, that's not my ride. This is my ride
over here. This black car's my ride.

316
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,492
No, no, no.

317
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,861
The black one is mine. That's
the one I'm... this is my ride.

318
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,898
This is your ride.

319
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:01,768
Oh, come on, now. Who am I, Redd Foxx?
I can't roll in no shit like that.

320
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,805
Man, what's up, Sam?

321
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:08,942
That shit's not funny, Sam. I gotta
roll around in this shit all week.

322
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:13,647
Man, where's your stereo?
Never mind the stereo. What's that smell?

323
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,949
Oh, man, just get in.
We ain't got all day.

324
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,352
Man, this truck smells like fish.

325
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,523
Fish and shit.

326
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,393
Apartment 304. You want me to come up?

327
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:30,531
Nah, it probably won't turn up anything.
I'm just gonna talk to him.

328
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,533
Good, 'cause I don't
wanna be late.

329
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:36,603
Hey, you want anything on the game?
What's the line?

330
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:40,473
Warriors plus six.
I'll take half your action.

331
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,543
Very, very smart man.

332
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:44,578
Hurry up, man.

333
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:31,024
Who is it? Lieutenant Sam Baffert from
the San Francisco police department.

334
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,763
Everything all right?

335
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:39,833
May I come in? I would just like
to ask you a couple of questions.

336
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,835
Absolutely. Come on in.

337
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:43,837
Thank you.

338
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,974
Nice.

339
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,976
Very nice.
Thanks.

340
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,381
Count Basie?
Ellington.

341
00:21:55,481 --> 00:22:00,420
"Things ain't what they used to
be." It was recorded July 30, 1945.

342
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:03,489
Yeah, yeah.
Now I can hear it.

343
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,692
Where did you find
an old recording like that?

344
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:10,697
There's a used record shop down on
Turk street called memory Lane.

345
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:13,366
I went in there looking
for a rare Robert Johnson.

346
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,936
I think I know the place. I'd
like to get in there. You should.

347
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:18,505
Mr. Korda, do you know
a Frank Antonucci?

348
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,809
Guy who owns the bakery
down the street?

349
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,845
No, this is a different Frank.

350
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:26,847
This is a man
who deals in jewelry.

351
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:29,583
Stolen, usually. You wouldn't
know anybody like that?

352
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:34,087
No, I certainly would not.

353
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:38,458
Is it... no, it's just a
little something here.

354
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,695
Could I have
a little water, please?

355
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,766
Sure.

356
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,768
Thank you.

357
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,138
The reason I'm asking
you is because...

358
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:55,141
We arrested him
with some stolen jewelry.

359
00:22:56,777 --> 00:23:01,982
We traced it back to a robbery
of a store down on Polk street.

360
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:05,451
He said he was
fencing it for you.

361
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,456
Obviously, there's been
some mistake.

362
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,693
Look, I gotta level with you.

363
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:16,429
I got this cousin.
Here you go.

364
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,999
He's had a lot of run-ins
with the law.

365
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:22,569
I wouldn't be surprised if he's trying
to entangle me in this situation.

366
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:26,006
It wouldn't be the first time. This
cousin of yours. What's his name?

367
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:30,577
Clarence teal. Believe me, they'll
know who I'm talkin' about.

368
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:32,879
Your cough seems better.

369
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:35,982
Oh, yes.

370
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,451
Two hundred bucks.
I'll take the points.

371
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,453
Yeah. Okay.

372
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,860
Hello, judge stone? This is
lieutenant Samuel Baffert.

373
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,697
I'm at a suspect's residence. I'm
requesting a telephonic search warrant.

374
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:58,505
There's visible evidence on the premises,
glassine envelopes with jeweler's markings.

375
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:04,477
That is correct, judge stone.

376
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,547
I believe a full search
of the premises will turn up...

377
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:55,028
Jesus! Sam! Sam!

378
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:04,204
Call an ambulance!
Now! Now!

379
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,902
Oh, my god!

380
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,914
Clear for rescue.
I'm a cop.

381
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,894
Move!

382
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:16,977
Yes, sir, all of our forces will be
brought to bear. We will get this guy.

383
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,846
Yeah, he's here.
I'll tell him.

384
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:25,118
The chief wants you to
know how sorry he is.

385
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,793
He said he was just going up
to talk to the guy.

386
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:38,231
He said...

387
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:47,841
I wanna be put on this case.
I can't do that.

388
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,310
No, I want&gt; To be put
on this case.

389
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,347
I cannot assign you to this. You're much
too close to it. You're too close to Sam.

390
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,817
You let the department handle it.
Who's runnin' it?

391
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,985
Roper!
Who's runnin' it?

392
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,822
Kimura and glass
will head the investigation.

393
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:07,293
Scott.
Go home.

394
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:19,405
Okay, check on it. Tell me what
you've got on the son of a bitch.

395
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:21,374
Let me get back to you.

396
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:24,010
Solis said to keep you
out of this.

397
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,046
I don't give a shit
what Solis said.

398
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:30,751
Anybody get any information on this
fucking korda, you tell me about it.

399
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:17,330
Just a minute.

400
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:27,941
Hey. Hey yourself. I
came to see Troy.

401
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,243
It's a little late for that, Scott.
He's asleep.

402
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:32,445
Oh, shit.

403
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:37,050
Jack Daniels? Yes, I spent
some time with Jack tonight.

404
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,252
But I'm not drunk yet.

405
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:43,023
Maybe you should be.

406
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:46,459
You heard about what happened?

407
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:50,096
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

408
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:57,303
Can I come in for a minute?

409
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:14,487
Is that a new picture?

410
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,489
It's about four months old.

411
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,292
I've been working
on a different style.

412
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,464
Hey, Troy.
How ya doin'?

413
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:30,937
How ya doin'? Did you miss me, huh?
Did you miss me?

414
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:33,373
Huh, Troy? Did you miss me?
Did you?

415
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:36,376
No kissing though.
No kissing.

416
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:40,346
You know I don't do
that kissing thing, right?

417
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:55,295
I'm not gonna take up too much of your
time. I need somebody I can talk to.

418
00:29:56,329 --> 00:30:00,834
Must be pretty awful. You don't usually
talk to someone when you're hurting.

419
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:05,371
It was my fault.
I was right downstairs.

420
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,440
All I had to do
was just go up with him.

421
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,576
I was right there.

422
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:13,313
Scott, y-you
can't save everyone.

423
00:30:14,581 --> 00:30:17,851
Yeah, well, I definitely proved
that tonight for sure.

424
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:49,382
Look, uh, I don't even know
why I came up here.

425
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:54,120
This was a...
Total waste of my time.

426
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,157
Where'd I put my keys?
Where'd I put my keys?

427
00:30:57,257 --> 00:30:59,359
Scott, what do you want from me?

428
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:01,394
Obviously something
I can't have anymore.

429
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:04,264
Don't you dare
try to make me feel guilty.

430
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,968
The whole time we were together, you went out
of your way to prove you didn't need me.

431
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:12,438
And now suddenly, for one night, you
need me again? Well, I can't do that.

432
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,976
I can't be more than just your friend
because I know exactly what'll happen.

433
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:18,344
A few weeks from now
and you'll be back on top,

434
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:21,347
and you'll shut me out just as
soon as you don't need me again.

435
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:26,520
Is that what you think? You think I
didn't need you? That's what you think?

436
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,322
Well, if you did,
you never showed it.

437
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:35,228
Oh, Ronnie.

438
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:38,231
Look, listen to me.

439
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:41,134
Listen. Look at me.
Look at me.

440
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:46,072
In my whole life, I never
in my whole...

441
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,510
You expecting somebody?

442
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:58,519
This night is just getting
better and better.

443
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:02,255
Where are my keys?

444
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:06,527
They're here on the table
where you always leave them.

445
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:17,170
Hey, baby, I thought you...

446
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,506
Hey. Greg Barnett.

447
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,276
Excuse me.

448
00:32:56,409 --> 00:33:00,380
Hey, Mike. If you weren't
family I'd fucking kill you.

449
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:04,317
You told Antonucci you got
that shit from me?

450
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:07,754
Don't say shit. What the
fuck's the matter with you?

451
00:33:07,854 --> 00:33:10,023
I'm sorry, Mike.
Sorry about what?

452
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:13,527
He's got respect for you, Mike.
He was gonna try and lowball me.

453
00:33:13,627 --> 00:33:17,030
Yeah, and what the fuck
do I use you for, Clarence?

454
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,333
To be a walkin', fuckin' advertisement.
I'm sorry, Mike.

455
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,302
You're sorry?

456
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,439
Antonucci never flipped on anybody before.
He said he had the cops paid off.

457
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,475
Not the cop
that showed up at my door!

458
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,116
What happened, Mike?

459
00:33:44,825 --> 00:33:49,395
Mike.
I'm sorry, Mike.

460
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:55,702
Two days, I could've taken
that fuckin' store.

461
00:33:55,802 --> 00:33:58,238
Now I can't even show my face.

462
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:04,778
I got a couple thousand bucks,
Mike, if you need to leave town.

463
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:08,582
Leave town? They're gonna
know me in Des Moines by now.

464
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:13,186
Ten million dollars, Clarence.
Ten million fuckin' dollars!

465
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:17,490
I could've disappeared.
I could've had it made!

466
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:23,496
That's all right, Clarence.

467
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:30,270
I'll just stick around and take care of
you for the rest of my fuckin' life.

468
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:35,609
Did you k-kill him, Mike?

469
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:46,452
Oh, god.
I'm sorry, Mike.

470
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:54,194
I'm sorry, Mike... Mike...
I didn't know, Mike.

471
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:56,196
I fucked up, Mike.

472
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:02,736
I fucked up, man.
Oh, fuck. I'm fucked up.

473
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:08,308
Come on.
I didn't know.

474
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:10,511
I didn't know, Mike. I messed up.
Come here.

475
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:14,748
It's all right. It's all right.
I messed up.

476
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:19,753
I messed everything up. It's all right.
I didn't mean what I said.

477
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:22,756
I'm sorry.

478
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:27,127
It's not your fault
you're stupid.

479
00:35:31,364 --> 00:35:33,634
Eiko!
What you got on korda?

480
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:37,538
We ran a search on relatives. He's got a cousin
in town, Clarence teal, small-time thief.

481
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:39,540
Last known address
was on pine street.

482
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,742
He moved a month ago. We've got
a couple of leads to check.

483
00:35:41,842 --> 00:35:44,778
Did you check with DMV about vehicle
registration? It's being faxed over now.

484
00:35:44,878 --> 00:35:48,849
How about the record room for any incident
reports? We can get medical records.

485
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:51,618
Have somebody check with burglary detail.
See if they know him and if...

486
00:35:51,718 --> 00:35:53,620
Look, roper. We've...
forensics on two.

487
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,222
And bars. Find out the kind
of bars he used to frequent.

488
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,258
Scott, we're into it.
I'm into this shit.

489
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:01,194
Roper, we've already had
this conversation.

490
00:36:01,294 --> 00:36:03,597
You are not&gt; Active
on this case.

491
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:08,501
It's in everyone's
best interest.

492
00:36:21,414 --> 00:36:24,284
Well, y'all are doing
good work here. I'm...

493
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:31,457
Sorry about your friend. I lost
somebody in SWAT. I know it's rough.

494
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:36,663
I appreciate your concern, but let's just
leave it at that. What's this you're reading?

495
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:41,802
Strategies and countermeasures
in hostage situations.

496
00:36:44,337 --> 00:36:47,273
You're not having too much progress
with this thing either. Oh, wait, no.

497
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,477
You really had me stumped.

498
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,492
Very impressive.
You get an "a."

499
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:10,430
See, no force was required. No
damage was done. All right?

500
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:40,661
That was your partner?

501
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:42,696
Yeah.

502
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:53,507
Why'd he do that?

503
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:57,678
Well, he figured the kid had a
zero percent chance of survival.

504
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:00,280
I guess he thought
his odds were better.

505
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,483
We had a plan, then SWAT
opened up fire too early,

506
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:06,720
and a perp took out my partner.

507
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,355
You remember this.

508
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:13,026
You always use your eyes to keep that
connection. That's the most important thing.

509
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:16,597
It's like hypnosis.
Right.

510
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:19,800
You connect with them.
You're always on their side.

511
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:23,504
Okay.

512
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:36,650
How much money you got on you?

513
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,686
What's that? How
much money you got?

514
00:38:39,786 --> 00:38:43,089
I don't know, like 100 bucks.
Why? Come on.

515
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,967
Ladies and
gentlemen, ten minutes to post.

516
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:56,603
You know why I
like coming to the track?

517
00:38:56,703 --> 00:38:58,772
Yeah. You're
a compulsive gambler.

518
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:01,041
No. The multitude
of possibilities.

519
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:04,377
Everything is here for you to see if
you know what conditions to look for.

520
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:07,480
Mm-hmm. Just like a hostage situation.
See the four horse?

521
00:39:07,581 --> 00:39:11,885
Mm-hmm. Droppin' in class, no works,
front wraps, all broken down.

522
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:13,887
You wouldn't bet on him, right?
Right.

523
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:16,857
Wrong. You bet on him. 'Cause see
the woman with the big belt buckle.

524
00:39:16,957 --> 00:39:20,661
That's the owner of the horse. And that
belt buckle is a championship belt buckle.

525
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:23,530
She wouldn't come out here with a fancy
buckle on unless the horse was live.

526
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,699
We go with him. That's how you
pick your bets? By belt buckles?

527
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:29,503
Well, just trust me now. You see the
horse next to that. That's the favorite.

528
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:32,673
Lookin' all washy, foamin' in the
mouth, lookin' all rank and shit.

529
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:36,577
Supposed to be the favorite. He don't even feel
like runnin'. We don't go with him. He's out.

530
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:38,579
Okay.
Now, the six horse.

531
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:42,382
The six horse looks great.
A shiny coat, that bouncy walk.

532
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:46,920
That horse is live. And that trainee/jockey
combo? You can't lose on that.

533
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,791
What do you think? I got two
WORDS FOR YOU: Seek help.

534
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:56,062
Oh, and I have three words
for you: Exacta. Come on.

535
00:39:56,162 --> 00:39:58,599
And away they go!

536
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:01,802
Come on! Come on!

537
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:06,707
Okay, we're in good shape.
We're in good shape.

538
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:11,645
Six horse is last. Don't worry about that.
That's his style.

539
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:14,014
What? To run last.
To run late.

540
00:40:15,682 --> 00:40:17,784
See!

541
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:20,687
The favorite's fading and the four horse
is in the lead. Just like I said.

542
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:23,924
Our guy is still last. Don't worry.
He'll be runnin' at the quarter pole.

543
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:26,660
Come on, six horse!

544
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,795
Come on, Russell.
We need first and second.

545
00:40:28,895 --> 00:40:31,532
First and second. Come on, Russell.
Who's Russell?

546
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:34,635
The jockey.
Come on, Russell.

547
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:36,637
Come on, Russell!
How much do we win?

548
00:40:36,737 --> 00:40:38,639
Eight hundred dollars.
Come on, Russell.

549
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:40,807
We win $800? Come on, Russell.
Eight hundred dollars.

550
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:42,909
Come on, Russell.
Come on, Russell.

551
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:44,811
Russell!
Get that 800, Russell.

552
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:47,748
<i>Come on! Let's go, Russell! Come
on, Russell! Come on, Russell!</i>

553
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:50,551
<i>Come on, Russell!
Way to go! Way to go!</i>

554
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:53,620
Come on! Come on!
Go! Go!

555
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,889
Come on! Come on!
Go!

556
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:58,191
We won! We won! Oh, shit.
We lost.

557
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,861
We won! We won! We lost!
You wanna bet?

558
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:03,463
You wanna bet on whether we just won?
What, are you crazy?

559
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:06,767
Russell, you midget fuck! You
little midget m... we won!

560
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:10,737
We won! We won! We won!
Hey, we won!

561
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:12,939
Way to go, Russell. Way to go, Russell.
Hey, Russell!

562
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:14,941
Don't worry about him, Russell.

563
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:17,010
Hey, Russell, it's cool.
Whoo!

564
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:20,246
How long you been coming here?

565
00:41:20,346 --> 00:41:23,750
About six years. My old partner
turned me on to this place.

566
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:27,754
Is it always like this? Well, occasionally
you lose, but today we are winners.

567
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:29,756
That's right.
Pay the winners, please.

568
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,859
Oh, Benjamin.

569
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:35,696
Benjamin looks so sad.
I'm in such a wonderful mood.

570
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:38,699
Here you go.
There's your share.

571
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,867
Wait, wait. That's only three.
What?

572
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:43,704
Oh, you got good eyes.

573
00:41:43,804 --> 00:41:46,106
That's part of your training.
That's right.

574
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:48,709
I was making sure you can...

575
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,711
Hello.

576
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,816
Okay. I'm on my way.

577
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,884
Let's go.

578
00:42:10,897 --> 00:42:14,234
Gonna need another R.
A. Unit!

579
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,640
The police are approaching.

580
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:31,051
What's the 10-20 on the incident?
Shreve, right on the corner.

581
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:40,894
Man, this looks like a
shit sandwich. Yeah.

582
00:42:42,128 --> 00:42:44,064
You see this car?

583
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:47,568
I'm riding around in a shitmobile, and Solis
got this out of impound for 14 grand.

584
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:49,570
It's worth at least 30.

585
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,773
Police corruption's everywhere.
Bastard.

586
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:59,012
Where's Solis?

587
00:42:59,112 --> 00:43:02,315
Right. Okay. You relax.
Joe... Joe...

588
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:05,819
Thirty-two minutes ago, the silent
alarm went off, then the fire alarm.

589
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:08,855
There was a unit about a block away.
The suspect got trapped inside.

590
00:43:08,955 --> 00:43:10,857
You got any verification
on numbers?

591
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:13,994
So far, we've only seen and talked to
one suspect. He calls himself Joe.

592
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:16,997
Now there's no confirmation,
but there could be more.

593
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:19,132
An employee escaped
through the rear door.

594
00:43:19,232 --> 00:43:22,268
As far as we can ascertain, there's
two jewelers, two salespeople,

595
00:43:22,368 --> 00:43:25,606
a manager, security guard, elderly
woman; We believe one other female.

596
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:30,877
This particular store is where they do
a lot of jewelry making and repair.

597
00:43:30,977 --> 00:43:34,347
On any given day, they can have between
eight and ten million in raw stones.

598
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:37,383
They knew what they were lookin' for.
What have you promised them?

599
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:40,220
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
Locate any points of entrance?

600
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,889
This place is designed
to be a vault.

601
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:00,140
Okay. Tape's rolling.

602
00:44:02,075 --> 00:44:04,077
Yeah.

603
00:44:04,177 --> 00:44:06,346
Hello, Joe. I'm inspector roper.
How you people doin' in there?

604
00:44:06,446 --> 00:44:09,349
Good. Solis
is off the job now.

605
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:13,119
I'm the guy who's authorized to give you
everything you want. First, I gotta talk to you.

606
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:16,256
No, you don't.
Yes, I do, Joe.

607
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:18,258
I have come down there,
and I have to talk to you...

608
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:20,260
To make sure that there are
no misunderstandings...

609
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,997
And make sure nobody is hurt in there
before we can take care of business.

610
00:44:24,097 --> 00:44:27,000
All right, roper.
You wanna come? Come.

611
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,404
Listen. I'm not armed, okay? We gotta
operate on trust here. I'm not armed.

612
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:34,174
I'm gonna talk to you and
get you guys out of there.

613
00:44:34,274 --> 00:44:36,209
Five minutes.

614
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:54,895
This is obviously the part
of the job that sucks.

615
00:45:30,163 --> 00:45:32,298
Hey, hey, hey.

616
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,496
How can he be sure
the guy won't shoot him?

617
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:05,498
He can't.

618
00:46:23,149 --> 00:46:25,118
Right there.

619
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:28,188
Can I put my hands down?

620
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:30,156
Where I can see 'em.

621
00:46:33,594 --> 00:46:36,029
You're roper, and you're
in charge, right?

622
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:38,932
Yep. Good. You listen up.

623
00:46:39,032 --> 00:46:40,934
I say this one time.

624
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:44,037
I want a four-wheel drive.
New, perfect condition.

625
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:47,107
I want a uniformed cop. Drive it up
right here. Leave the engine running.

626
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:50,076
He walks to the end of the block.
Then we'll come out.

627
00:46:50,176 --> 00:46:53,580
I know all the tricks, so no
remote control devices, okay?

628
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,517
When I say perfect condition, I
mean, if it's low in wiper fluid,

629
00:46:56,617 --> 00:46:58,519
someone gets shot,
and we'll start again.

630
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,521
I want a plane waitin'
at the airport.

631
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:03,524
I'll tell him where I'm
goin' when I get there.

632
00:47:03,624 --> 00:47:06,893
Is that all?
For now, that's all.

633
00:47:08,562 --> 00:47:12,365
Okay, you're gonna get all those things,
but first you gotta do something for me.

634
00:47:12,465 --> 00:47:15,368
Let me come inside and make
sure everybody's all right.

635
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:18,104
You just do shit for me
right now.

636
00:47:18,204 --> 00:47:20,106
Wait a minute, Joe.
I'm doin' a lot for you, okay?

637
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:22,375
You gotta do somethin' for me. You
gotta show an act of good faith.

638
00:47:22,475 --> 00:47:25,145
Let me have one hostage.

639
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:27,147
I give you somethin'.

640
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:29,382
Here.

641
00:47:44,464 --> 00:47:46,633
In 15 minutes,
it'll be a bigger piece.

642
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:48,635
We understand each other?

643
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,204
Yeah, we understand each other.

644
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:53,106
Good.

645
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:55,108
No, no, no, please.

646
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:58,111
No, sir, not to
the best of my knowledge.

647
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:00,113
That's correct.

648
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:02,082
That's right.

649
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:05,151
He's here right now.
Let me get back to you.

650
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,355
We're gonna have to take
this guy out.

651
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:12,258
Well, can't we wear him down?

652
00:48:15,261 --> 00:48:18,331
I believe there's at least one
fatality in there already.

653
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,967
I think it was gunfire
that set the fire alarm off.

654
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:23,369
I think this guy is working by himself 'cause
the whole time I was talkin' to him...

655
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:26,573
He had a hostage and he had a gun to her
head, and he wouldn't leave the door.

656
00:48:26,673 --> 00:48:29,576
He's got a real calm and creepy demeanor.
The guy's a fucking wacko.

657
00:48:29,676 --> 00:48:33,246
The scariest thing about him is he
indicated familiarity with our techniques.

658
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:36,583
So what do you want to do? You wanna go
in there or wait for him to come out?

659
00:48:36,683 --> 00:48:41,087
Let him come out. There's too
many unknowns. He's right.

660
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:44,991
Show me.

661
00:48:47,994 --> 00:48:51,097
When we drive up the car, make sure it's at
an angle about three feet away from the curb.

662
00:48:51,197 --> 00:48:53,099
We put our best man high ground.
Is Anderson here? Yes.

663
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,469
Good. Okay,
twenty degrees down angle.

664
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,472
Tell Anderson to prep and
notify us when he's on line.

665
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:06,947
I can feel this thing going sideways on us.
Well, there's some good news.

666
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:09,349
He's wearing a ski mask,
so he's protecting his identity,

667
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:13,687
and he hasn't determined whether or not he's
gonna kill the rest of the hostages... yet.

668
00:49:22,663 --> 00:49:26,499
You. You! Up, up!

669
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,269
Start pullin' those bodies back
behind that counter. Let's go.

670
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:31,471
Do it! Move!

671
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:34,107
Let's go. Come on!

672
00:49:35,308 --> 00:49:37,410
Back behind here.
Faster!

673
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:39,412
Let's go!

674
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:42,683
He's gonna... he's gonna kill us.
Please. It's gonna be...

675
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,686
Over there.
In there.

676
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:58,264
I'm not, I'm not staying here.
I'm not staying here.

677
00:49:58,364 --> 00:50:01,234
No, no, please don't, please don't.
Mrs. Dotson, please don't go.

678
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:03,537
Mrs. Dotson, please!

679
00:50:03,637 --> 00:50:06,640
Hey! Hey!
Stop, miss Dotson.

680
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:08,675
Hey!
Leave her alone.

681
00:50:08,775 --> 00:50:10,577
What?
Leave her alone.

682
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:16,016
Think.

683
00:50:17,718 --> 00:50:22,055
Doug, please,
sit down, sit down!

684
00:50:41,407 --> 00:50:46,412
If she's not conscious by the
time I'm done, she's dead.

685
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:48,414
What do you got, window?

686
00:50:48,515 --> 00:50:50,450
We have confirmation...

687
00:50:53,486 --> 00:50:56,056
Okay, it's time to give
this wacko a call.

688
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:10,604
How come he's not answering?

689
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:15,776
Wait, wait, wait.
There's your answer.

690
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:24,851
He's smart. He's cuttin'
down visibility.

691
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:27,721
Yup. He's
doin' a good job of it.

692
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:32,425
You have a green light.

693
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:39,533
Come on. Give us
one clean shot, asshole.

694
00:51:39,633 --> 00:51:45,105
Command one, repeat. All
POSITIONS: You have a green light.

695
00:51:46,172 --> 00:51:48,274
He switched clothes.
That's korda!

696
00:51:48,374 --> 00:51:51,177
That's korda! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

697
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:56,517
I said hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

698
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:59,520
Hold your fire!

699
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,724
No, no, no. Please, let me go!
Come on. In this truck.

700
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:08,394
Get in! Please!

701
00:52:08,494 --> 00:52:10,531
Bunch of fuck ups.
Get him on the radio.

702
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:12,666
These your keys?
What? Yeah, yeah.

703
00:52:12,766 --> 00:52:15,168
He's got a girl. Let's go. Hey,
roper, what are you gonna do?

704
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:06,386
Additional units in the area. We need
all additional units in the area.

705
00:53:08,822 --> 00:53:11,224
Oh, oh, please, god.

706
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:21,635
Hey, watch it!

707
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:37,684
Stop!

708
00:53:46,693 --> 00:53:49,395
Please! Suspect heading
west on Sutter, passing Laguna.

709
00:53:49,495 --> 00:53:51,397
Can we get an intercept?

710
00:54:30,403 --> 00:54:35,576
Move! Come on now!

711
00:54:35,676 --> 00:54:37,878
Let me out!

712
00:54:37,978 --> 00:54:40,280
Please!
Shut up.

713
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:15,616
Everybody okay? Just stay there, man.

714
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:38,839
What's going on?

715
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:40,874
Hey, man, what's this?
Get the fuck off.

716
00:55:45,946 --> 00:55:48,549
Everybody, just stay calm.

717
00:55:51,718 --> 00:55:54,354
Just take it easy.
What?

718
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:57,023
Just take it easy. Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

719
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,737
What the fuck is going on? I don't
know, but I gotta get up there.

720
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:57,483
What's going on here?

721
00:57:17,904 --> 00:57:23,710
Shit!

722
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:26,446
Get the fuck off me!
Hold the wheel! Take the wheel!

723
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:28,181
What?
Got it? Got it?

724
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:34,120
Shut up!

725
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:10,757
Get outta the way.

726
00:59:47,387 --> 00:59:50,957
What's the problem?
I can't get the brakes to work!

727
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:05,972
We're coming to the end
of the line!

728
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,810
Oh, shit.
Get the car steady!

729
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,845
Come on!

730
01:00:12,412 --> 01:00:15,616
Go! Move ahead!

731
01:00:15,716 --> 01:00:17,918
Hard right!

732
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:34,768
Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!

733
01:00:44,277 --> 01:00:47,781
Move!

734
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:51,752
Oh, my god!
Look at that! What the hell is that?

735
01:00:58,024 --> 01:01:00,393
Outta the way!
Outta the way!

736
01:01:04,164 --> 01:01:06,232
Move!

737
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,850
That guy down there...
there, there! He's running!

738
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,952
Hey, he's getting away!

739
01:01:26,052 --> 01:01:29,823
Somebody stop him!
Get him!

740
01:01:42,435 --> 01:01:45,038
Shit!
I lost my piece!

741
01:01:49,175 --> 01:01:51,244
God bless SWAT.
Ready?

742
01:01:58,351 --> 01:02:01,021
You take this floor.
I'm goin' up.

743
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:32,539
Shit!

744
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,546
Stop there! Don't you move!
Don't you fucking move!

745
01:04:39,646 --> 01:04:41,548
Stay right there!
Right there!

746
01:04:41,648 --> 01:04:44,117
Put your hands up!
Put 'em up!

747
01:04:44,217 --> 01:04:46,152
Spread your fucking legs.

748
01:04:46,252 --> 01:04:48,655
You fucking move, I'll put your
fucking head in the trunk.

749
01:04:53,293 --> 01:04:58,532
Sam baffert was a friend of mine. He
had a wife, and he had a daughter!

750
01:04:58,632 --> 01:05:01,668
Why don't you tell that
to somebody who gives a shit?

751
01:05:08,074 --> 01:05:13,146
Want to kill me, inspector?
Huh?

752
01:05:13,246 --> 01:05:18,919
You can't kill me.
Oh, I can't?

753
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:21,588
What if we got into a struggle,
and my gun went off?

754
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:27,293
Could I kill you then?

755
01:05:27,393 --> 01:05:29,930
Huh?
Could I kill you then?

756
01:05:37,538 --> 01:05:39,472
Roper!

757
01:05:41,174 --> 01:05:44,545
You got him.

758
01:05:44,645 --> 01:05:46,613
Put the gun down.

759
01:05:46,713 --> 01:05:50,150
You got him, man.
Put it down.

760
01:05:52,185 --> 01:05:54,988
Come on, man, put it down.

761
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:11,672
I'm gonna do this shit
by the book,

762
01:06:11,772 --> 01:06:14,374
but you ain't gonna be
fucking smiling at me!

763
01:06:20,113 --> 01:06:22,415
Give me your hands.

764
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:28,254
Come up. Get up.

765
01:06:28,354 --> 01:06:31,091
Get up. Come on.

766
01:06:42,068 --> 01:06:45,271
Listen, I'll catch up with you guys later.
Okay. See you.

767
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:49,075
Want to get something to eat?
Yeah.

768
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:10,063
You weren't
at the press conference.

769
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:13,700
I wanted to get
this out of the way first.

770
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:19,339
Have you got a bet
on the game tonight?

771
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:22,175
As a matter of fact, I do have
a bet on the game tonight.

772
01:07:22,275 --> 01:07:25,646
Of course you do. Then you
know it's already started.

773
01:07:25,746 --> 01:07:31,317
Well, I was going to catch the
last half on TV later on.

774
01:07:37,123 --> 01:07:39,159
Well, good night.

775
01:07:39,259 --> 01:07:43,463
You having dinner
with Mr. Baseball?

776
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:46,633
Greg is actually on a road trip.

777
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:50,537
I was just gonna go home
and make myself some pasta.

778
01:07:51,572 --> 01:07:55,075
Mmm, "go home
and make some pasta"?

779
01:07:55,175 --> 01:07:57,544
The one with the garlic and
the oil that I like so much?

780
01:07:57,644 --> 01:08:02,215
No, the kind you get out of a box.
The macaroni and the cheese.

781
01:08:02,315 --> 01:08:04,284
The instant&gt; Macaroni?

782
01:08:04,384 --> 01:08:08,655
Mmm. I've been craving
that stuff all week.

783
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:10,791
Yeah, it's hard to get.

784
01:08:10,891 --> 01:08:13,393
Oh, who are you telling?

785
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:18,164
Just dinner.

786
01:08:18,264 --> 01:08:20,066
Yeah, just dinner.

787
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:26,206
What the fuck... you bring me all the way over
here to tell me you ain't got no collateral?

788
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:29,209
Who do I look like to you? Santa Claus?
I'm a fucking bail bondsman.

789
01:08:29,309 --> 01:08:32,312
I know, I know. That's not what I'm saying.
Pick up the phone.

790
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:35,749
You think I got time to be messing around with
this crap? I got the stuff on the outside.

791
01:08:35,849 --> 01:08:37,751
I'm just waiting
for somebody to cash it in.

792
01:08:37,851 --> 01:08:41,522
It's real simple. Give me a fucking break.

793
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:45,692
Look, give me your card. I'll get
it to you by tomorrow night.

794
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:52,265
Thanks.

795
01:08:54,868 --> 01:08:59,906
Okay, now that's the freshly
ground pepper, stirred briskly.

796
01:09:00,006 --> 01:09:03,243
Are you listening? You stir it briskly.
Then you need lemon.

797
01:09:03,343 --> 01:09:05,478
I need lemon. There should
be one in the fridge.

798
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:08,248
Lemon in the refrigerator.

799
01:09:08,348 --> 01:09:10,383
You know, the last quarter of
the game is on. Oh, really.

800
01:09:10,483 --> 01:09:13,253
What game is that?

801
01:09:13,353 --> 01:09:15,789
Oh, whoa, you are
making an effort.

802
01:09:15,889 --> 01:09:18,625
That's right, and I'm gonna win too.
I am going to be the Victor.

803
01:09:18,725 --> 01:09:20,794
I'm going to score.

804
01:09:20,894 --> 01:09:24,865
Metaphorically speaking, of course.
I didn't mean like really scoring.

805
01:09:24,965 --> 01:09:28,201
Just dinner, remember. I know the rules.
Just dinner, just dinner.

806
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:32,506
Okay, I got this lemon in here.
Now, when you taste this,

807
01:09:32,606 --> 01:09:36,376
I want you to know that you're going to
be experiencing culinary perfection.

808
01:09:36,476 --> 01:09:39,345
Mmm. Now just calm down. I'm
giving you the background on this.

809
01:09:39,445 --> 01:09:41,748
This is the bomb salad dressing
that I bring...

810
01:09:41,848 --> 01:09:44,217
To all the cookouts
whenever my family gathers.

811
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:46,787
Mm-hmm. They say, "Scott,
bring it, Scott." You ready?

812
01:09:46,887 --> 01:09:48,889
Taste this. Huh?

813
01:09:48,989 --> 01:09:52,759
Is that not the bomb? That is
the shit right there. Mmm.

814
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:55,796
Honestly, something's missing.

815
01:09:55,896 --> 01:09:59,232
Oh, no, that's not missing anything. You're
just jealous 'cause you don't know how to...

816
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:03,570
See, in the U. K., they don't teach you how
to make this. See? This is perfection.

817
01:10:04,905 --> 01:10:07,273
You know,
it does need a little sugar.

818
01:10:08,975 --> 01:10:11,277
Why don't you put your finger in
there for the proper sweetness?

819
01:10:11,377 --> 01:10:14,848
Scott. That's a joke.
That's a compliment to you.

820
01:10:14,948 --> 01:10:17,250
I could have said, "why don't
you put your ass in this bowl?"

821
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:19,252
That's a joke.
It's all sweetness.

822
01:10:19,352 --> 01:10:21,855
I don't see how you're offended
because that's a compliment.

823
01:10:21,955 --> 01:10:26,627
If somebody told me to put my ass in a bowl
of salad dressing, I would be complimented.

824
01:10:34,968 --> 01:10:37,938
What would you say
if I gave up gambling?

825
01:10:40,874 --> 01:10:43,777
I'd say you'd be miserable.

826
01:10:45,846 --> 01:10:50,450
It's not so much the gambling. It's more
what the gambling got in the way of.

827
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:54,487
The track is where you would take your
troubles instead of sharing them with me.

828
01:10:58,992 --> 01:11:02,763
Scott, do you remember when you
lost that hostage on union square?

829
01:11:02,863 --> 01:11:05,732
Yes, I do.

830
01:11:05,832 --> 01:11:07,734
You came here that night,

831
01:11:07,834 --> 01:11:11,505
and you made love to me, and it
was so intense and so passionate.

832
01:11:11,605 --> 01:11:13,106
But you hadn't
even talked to me.

833
01:11:13,206 --> 01:11:16,843
I didn't even know what happened until
I saw it on the news the next morning.

834
01:11:16,943 --> 01:11:19,680
That's because I don't want you
to be part of that world, Ronnie.

835
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:22,282
Yeah, that's the point.
It's not "that world."

836
01:11:22,382 --> 01:11:24,818
It's your world.

837
01:11:24,918 --> 01:11:29,322
It's part of who you are.

838
01:11:41,768 --> 01:11:45,539
Look, Ronnie,
it's not easy for me.

839
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:48,341
I know I can't change overnight,

840
01:11:48,441 --> 01:11:51,545
but, listen to me,

841
01:11:51,645 --> 01:11:54,314
I know that I miss you,

842
01:11:54,414 --> 01:11:57,317
and I don't ever want
to be without you again.

843
01:11:57,417 --> 01:12:00,386
I'd really like to believe you.

844
01:12:00,486 --> 01:12:02,823
Well, then believe me.

845
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:09,696
Nobody asked you anything.

846
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:28,882
I missed you.

847
01:13:00,747 --> 01:13:02,816
I'm officer McCall.
What's going on?

848
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:05,819
What the fuck do you
mean, "what's going on?"

849
01:13:05,919 --> 01:13:08,454
I'm about to fucking waste
everybody in here, pal!

850
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:10,691
Okay, I'm a hostage negotiator.
I'm here to help you.

851
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:13,126
How the hell are you
gonna help me, pig?

852
01:13:13,226 --> 01:13:15,128
Screw you, man!

853
01:13:15,228 --> 01:13:17,664
Fuck you, dude!

854
01:13:17,764 --> 01:13:20,667
Well, I want you to tell me what you need.
What do I need?

855
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:22,669
I tell you
what I fucking need, man!

856
01:13:22,769 --> 01:13:24,705
I need you to fuckin' find
that dirtbag...

857
01:13:24,805 --> 01:13:27,941
That fuckin' ran off
with my wife, dude,

858
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:30,844
so I can cut
his fuckin' balls off, man!

859
01:13:30,944 --> 01:13:32,946
Okay, I can't do that.

860
01:13:33,046 --> 01:13:34,948
You can't fuckin' do it?

861
01:13:35,048 --> 01:13:39,485
Then why am I wasting
my fuckin' time with you, man!

862
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:43,456
You piece of fuckin' frog shit,
piece of shit asshole!

863
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:46,693
Hey, hey, is all the name-calling
necessary? I don't like the verbal abuse.

864
01:13:46,793 --> 01:13:48,995
No, not really, but I like
to throw all that in there...

865
01:13:49,095 --> 01:13:52,533
To kind of give it
the natural ambiance, you know.

866
01:13:54,935 --> 01:13:59,139
I'm officer McCall.
I'm unarmed.

867
01:13:59,239 --> 01:14:01,875
I just wanna make sure everybody
gets outta here safely.

868
01:14:01,975 --> 01:14:05,078
Stop right there. Close your eyes.
Okay.

869
01:14:05,178 --> 01:14:07,781
Tell me what you see.
I see a scumbag behind the counter...

870
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:11,051
With a sawed-off, nine millimeter
tucked away in his waistband.

871
01:14:11,151 --> 01:14:15,021
There's a female hostage down in front of
the cereal rack with a red polka-dot dress.

872
01:14:15,121 --> 01:14:18,925
Another hostage three feet to her right
with blue jeans and a checkered shirt.

873
01:14:19,025 --> 01:14:23,229
A male hostage down; Green shirt, white
pants, in front of the candy rack.

874
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:26,533
There's a female scumbag behind me
with a gun tucked away in her shirt,

875
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:28,535
trying to pass herself
off as a hostage.

876
01:14:28,635 --> 01:14:31,672
And there's a special on
TOILET PAPER: Four for $1.29.

877
01:14:31,772 --> 01:14:34,841
That's a lot of toilet paper.
Am I right?

878
01:14:34,941 --> 01:14:37,010
That's pretty good. You got good eyes.
You like that?

879
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,045
Very impressive.

880
01:14:49,255 --> 01:14:51,191
How you doing, Mike?
You doing all right?

881
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:54,027
How the fuck do you
think I'm doing?

882
01:14:54,127 --> 01:14:58,131
Now, I got something
I want you to do for me.

883
01:14:58,231 --> 01:15:02,836
This fucker, roper...
He's got a girlfriend.

884
01:15:02,936 --> 01:15:06,807
She works the newspaper.

885
01:15:06,907 --> 01:15:11,044
So, what do you want... what...

886
01:15:13,914 --> 01:15:18,952
Oh, Mike... no, Mike, come on.
You know that's not my thing.

887
01:15:19,052 --> 01:15:21,622
Hey, don't give me any shit, Clarence.
I'm in here because of you.

888
01:15:21,722 --> 01:15:24,224
Mike, come on, man.
You know, you...

889
01:15:24,324 --> 01:15:27,894
You were just robbing the store,
and he was doing his job.

890
01:15:27,994 --> 01:15:29,963
Fuck you!

891
01:15:32,298 --> 01:15:35,536
Oh, Mike...
I carried you your whole life.

892
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:38,805
Hey, you needed money.
You needed a place to stay.

893
01:15:38,905 --> 01:15:43,009
You were strung out. Bail.
This time you are there for me.

894
01:15:43,109 --> 01:15:45,846
Mikey, don't do this to me, please.
You do it!

895
01:15:45,946 --> 01:15:48,081
I ain't gonna get away with it, Mike.
You just fuckin' do it!

896
01:15:51,918 --> 01:15:54,688
Guard!

897
01:16:04,064 --> 01:16:07,067
Fuck.

898
01:16:37,397 --> 01:16:39,299
Hello.

899
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:42,102
Hey, how you doing? I'm gonna stop
at the corner and get some wine.

900
01:16:42,202 --> 01:16:45,271
I got the bread already.
Dinner will be ready soon.

901
01:16:45,371 --> 01:16:47,708
Okay. Good.
I'm starving.

902
01:16:47,808 --> 01:16:49,943
All right.
I'll see you later.

903
01:17:46,299 --> 01:17:48,869
Thanks.
That all for you?

904
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,756
Ow.

905
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,382
No!

906
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:47,420
No!

907
01:20:00,066 --> 01:20:02,569
Help me!

908
01:20:06,406 --> 01:20:09,275
Help me!

909
01:20:25,091 --> 01:20:29,362
Ronnie!

910
01:20:30,997 --> 01:20:33,133
Ronnie!

911
01:20:50,183 --> 01:20:53,286
You okay?
Yeah.

912
01:21:34,227 --> 01:21:37,030
Watch it!

913
01:23:52,799 --> 01:23:57,170
If you try to hurt me or anybody
else I know, I swear to god...

914
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:59,706
I'm gonna find a way to get in here,
and I'm gonna bust your fuckin' ass!

915
01:23:59,806 --> 01:24:01,708
Then I'm gonna put my gun in your mouth
and blow your fuckin' brains out.

916
01:24:01,808 --> 01:24:04,711
You understand? I don't even
know what you're talkin' about.

917
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:06,680
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about.
No, I'm afraid I do not.

918
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,682
Don't fuckin' play games. You know
what the fuck I'm... no, I don't.

919
01:24:08,782 --> 01:24:11,552
You don't know what the fuck I'm
talkin' about? You see this guy here?

920
01:24:11,652 --> 01:24:13,554
That's your cousin, right?

921
01:24:13,654 --> 01:24:16,523
Well, the guy with the white
gloves on is the coroner.

922
01:24:16,623 --> 01:24:18,625
That's what the fuck
I'm talkin' about!

923
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:22,162
I'm talkin' about not playing with me,
motherfucker! Don't fuck with me, man!

924
01:24:22,262 --> 01:24:24,631
I'm not playin' with you!

925
01:24:29,570 --> 01:24:33,239
You know, in Naples,
there's an expression:

926
01:24:33,339 --> 01:24:35,676
When you think you're fuckin'
them, they're fuckin' you.

927
01:24:35,776 --> 01:24:38,378
Well, you know what? You ain't in
motherfuckin' Naples right now!

928
01:24:38,478 --> 01:24:42,182
Fuck that Naples shit! Did you hear
what the fuck I just told you?

929
01:24:42,282 --> 01:24:48,154
I don't give a fuck
about anything or anybody.

930
01:24:48,254 --> 01:24:50,757
Not now.

931
01:24:50,857 --> 01:24:55,095
Least of all a nigger cop
interferes with what's mine.

932
01:24:55,195 --> 01:24:58,464
And what is mine
is $10 million worth.

933
01:24:58,565 --> 01:25:01,301
You come in here,
you threaten me,

934
01:25:01,401 --> 01:25:06,372
show me a photo of my
dead cousin, my family.

935
01:25:06,472 --> 01:25:08,509
I got at least
ten years in here...

936
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:12,212
To figure out exactly
how to fuck with you...

937
01:25:12,312 --> 01:25:14,748
And everything you care about.
Hey, fuck you!

938
01:25:14,848 --> 01:25:17,651
You say you don't give a fuck?
I don't give a fuck neither!

939
01:25:17,751 --> 01:25:21,187
I don't give a fuck about you!
Fucker! Try me!

940
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:25,659
Fuckin' try me and see what the fuck...
get the fuck off me! You try me!

941
01:25:34,935 --> 01:25:37,503
You enjoy San Francisco, huh?
Oh, I love it.

942
01:25:37,604 --> 01:25:40,373
Have you been
to the de young museum?

943
01:25:40,473 --> 01:25:42,643
Cheers.

944
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:52,919
Sorry.

945
01:25:54,454 --> 01:25:56,456
Thank you.

946
01:25:58,491 --> 01:26:01,595
Thank you so much.

947
01:26:01,695 --> 01:26:03,797
It has an excellent nose.

948
01:26:03,897 --> 01:26:06,299
It's quite vintage,
and you may serve it up.

949
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:08,301
Thank you.

950
01:26:08,401 --> 01:26:11,371
This evening's specials,
we have grilled squab...

951
01:26:11,471 --> 01:26:14,541
With a sweet potato,
foie gras spring roll...

952
01:26:14,641 --> 01:26:16,943
With a wild huckleberry sauce.

953
01:26:17,043 --> 01:26:21,682
We also are offering braised sweetbreads
with white truffle sauce...

954
01:26:21,782 --> 01:26:23,917
On cracked bulgur.
"Cracked bulgur"?

955
01:26:24,017 --> 01:26:28,388
Mm-hmm. You know, my mouth has been
screaming for some cracked bulgur all week.

956
01:26:28,488 --> 01:26:30,390
Can we have a couple of minutes
to look at the menu,

957
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:32,392
oh, sure. Take your time.
Maybe see something else?

958
01:26:32,492 --> 01:26:35,662
Man can't live on cracked bulgur alone.

959
01:26:37,998 --> 01:26:40,400
Nice place, huh?

960
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,269
Yeah, I think it's really nice.
A bit expensive though.

961
01:26:43,369 --> 01:26:45,806
Very, very, very expensive.

962
01:26:45,906 --> 01:26:47,808
In fact, it's costing me
quite a pretty penny...

963
01:26:47,908 --> 01:26:49,843
To wine and dine you
in such fashion,

964
01:26:49,943 --> 01:26:53,213
so I hope you're appreciative of it.
Mmm, but I think I'm worth it.

965
01:26:53,313 --> 01:26:54,981
I think you're worth it too.

966
01:26:55,081 --> 01:26:59,853
In fact, this is the perfect
setting for my little plan.

967
01:26:59,953 --> 01:27:01,855
You see, I know you know...

968
01:27:03,456 --> 01:27:06,226
There's a very important reason why I
wanted to have dinner with you tonight.

969
01:27:06,326 --> 01:27:08,595
I didn't realize that
at all, no.

970
01:27:08,695 --> 01:27:13,934
Veronica, this last week has been
incredible for me. You know, I...

971
01:27:14,034 --> 01:27:16,937
I feel like our relationship went
to the next phase or something...

972
01:27:17,037 --> 01:27:20,674
And kind of crystallized
into this new thing and...

973
01:27:20,774 --> 01:27:24,344
I'm hoping that the feeling is mutual.
Well, of course it's mutual.

974
01:27:24,444 --> 01:27:26,680
Good, because, Veronica,

975
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:29,683
there comes a time
in every relationship...

976
01:27:29,783 --> 01:27:32,452
When things get more serious.

977
01:27:32,553 --> 01:27:34,755
Yeah.
The last week...

978
01:27:34,855 --> 01:27:36,723
I have rehearsed this
so many times.

979
01:27:36,823 --> 01:27:39,826
I've been sitting and trying to
figure out the best way to do this,

980
01:27:39,926 --> 01:27:41,828
and I said this is
the perfect setting.

981
01:27:41,928 --> 01:27:45,365
You've got the perfect dress
and the perfect face and...

982
01:27:45,465 --> 01:27:48,434
I think I should just show you.
Oh, no, no. Listen...

983
01:27:48,535 --> 01:27:51,271
We haven't even spoken
about this, Scottie.

984
01:27:51,371 --> 01:27:55,308
This is going to be really embarrassing.
Come on, please, can we...

985
01:27:55,408 --> 01:27:57,010
Eh?

986
01:27:58,512 --> 01:28:03,584
Tahiti?
Tahiti, yes.

987
01:28:03,684 --> 01:28:06,452
Vacation. Yes, a
vacation to Tahiti.

988
01:28:06,553 --> 01:28:10,691
You and I. Two trips. Round-trip
tickets to Tahiti. Yes?

989
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:13,627
Yeah, that I will do. All right.
What do you mean, "that"?

990
01:28:13,727 --> 01:28:16,462
What'd you think I was going to ask you?
Well, come on.

991
01:28:16,563 --> 01:28:19,700
The way you were talking... oh, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

992
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,703
Let's go to Tahiti first. Make it
a little road test.

993
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:24,705
So are we going to Tahiti?
Did you say yes?

994
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:27,440
That is a yes. We're going
to... we're going to Tahiti.

995
01:28:27,541 --> 01:28:29,976
Stop it. We're going... hey,
they're not gonna be there.

996
01:28:30,076 --> 01:28:31,978
They ain't gonna never see us
no more. Let's toast it.

997
01:28:32,078 --> 01:28:34,014
To Tahiti.
To being "nekked" in Tahiti.

998
01:28:34,114 --> 01:28:37,417
Come on, say it. "Nekked in
Tahiti." Naked in Tahiti.

999
01:28:37,518 --> 01:28:39,986
Not "naked in Tahiti."
That's how I say it.

1000
01:28:40,086 --> 01:28:42,422
"Nekked."
"nekked."

1001
01:28:42,523 --> 01:28:44,958
There you go.
Say, "nekked in Tahiti."

1002
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,695
Hold it. Let me picture you nekked.

1003
01:28:48,795 --> 01:28:51,965
Oh, look at the sun
bouncing off your ass.

1004
01:28:52,065 --> 01:28:55,869
I'm sorry.

1005
01:28:55,969 --> 01:28:58,939
If it's not here by 5:00,
it's not my problem.

1006
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:02,576
Don't talk to me about Mitch. I'm
running this shift, not Mitch.

1007
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:04,611
I don't care.
Got another load.

1008
01:29:04,711 --> 01:29:06,647
Yeah, rack 'em.

1009
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:11,985
<i>Yeah, well you got
the memo from city hall too, right?</i>

1010
01:29:12,085 --> 01:29:16,890
I've got 'em right here. No, they
went down at 9:30 to San Bruno.

1011
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:21,027
Yeah, they've got the old forms. The new
forms have the wrong date or something.

1012
01:29:21,127 --> 01:29:22,996
'91 or '92, I don't know.

1013
01:29:23,096 --> 01:29:27,634
Yeah. Yeah, well, don't
give me any grief about it.

1014
01:29:27,734 --> 01:29:31,071
No, Frank told me.

1015
01:29:31,171 --> 01:29:34,841
Look, I can't spend any
more time on this. Okay?

1016
01:29:34,941 --> 01:29:38,111
That's it. All done.

1017
01:29:38,211 --> 01:29:40,614
Yeah.

1018
01:29:40,714 --> 01:29:43,784
Well, no. Well, you
can tell that to Mitch too.

1019
01:29:43,884 --> 01:29:46,687
Okay? Don't call me
on this anymore.

1020
01:29:46,787 --> 01:29:50,657
Yeah, well, don't give me
any grief about it.

1021
01:29:52,659 --> 01:29:56,029
Hey, don't you guys
keep notes down there?

1022
01:30:36,269 --> 01:30:38,672
How come, in those foreign movies,
the young girl always falls in love...

1023
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:43,944
With the old, fat guy? I guess women
in Europe find older men sexy.

1024
01:30:44,044 --> 01:30:49,650
Shit. When I get old and fat,
I'm definitely moving to Europe.

1025
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:51,918
That guy was 60 years old. Shit.

1026
01:30:52,018 --> 01:30:55,622
I forgot to feed Troy.
I bet he's starving.

1027
01:30:55,722 --> 01:30:58,058
Troy, where are you, baby?
I'm sorry.

1028
01:30:58,158 --> 01:31:01,728
Troy?

1029
01:31:01,828 --> 01:31:04,831
Troy, where are you hiding?

1030
01:31:07,233 --> 01:31:12,639
Troy? My eyes are still hurting
from reading that movie.

1031
01:31:12,739 --> 01:31:17,043
Troy, I've got food for you.

1032
01:31:17,143 --> 01:31:20,914
Troy?

1033
01:31:25,218 --> 01:31:28,154
Where are you?

1034
01:31:39,933 --> 01:31:42,235
Scott, have you seen...

1035
01:31:42,335 --> 01:31:46,740
Hey, baby, there you are.
Yes.

1036
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:50,076
Hey, have you been eating my face
soap again? You have, haven't you?

1037
01:31:52,713 --> 01:31:55,916
Scott, what is it?
Korda escaped.

1038
01:31:56,016 --> 01:32:00,253
Korda's escaped?
This morning.

1039
01:32:00,353 --> 01:32:02,889
You don't think he'd try and...

1040
01:32:02,989 --> 01:32:06,192
I-I'm just a little on edge.
I need to relax.

1041
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:08,929
I'm sure he's gonna try to get out of town,
and we're leaving tomorrow anyway, you know?

1042
01:32:09,029 --> 01:32:11,798
I'm sorry about that.
I just overreacted. Okay?

1043
01:32:11,898 --> 01:32:14,668
Okay?

1044
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:20,306
Why don't we feed the dog before
we have cujo on our hands, huh?

1045
01:32:28,348 --> 01:32:32,919
You packed everything? You sure you didn't
forget your bowling ball or... you know?

1046
01:32:33,019 --> 01:32:35,321
I sent that ahead, you wise guy.

1047
01:32:35,421 --> 01:32:38,892
You're bringing a lot of clothes to a place
where you're not supposed to wear clothes.

1048
01:32:38,992 --> 01:32:41,795
Don't you think it'd be better if you stayed in
the house 'til you're ready to get outta here?

1049
01:32:41,895 --> 01:32:43,930
No, I'm gonna
stay here and help you guys.

1050
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:45,932
No, I'm not playing. I think you
should go in the house, you know?

1051
01:32:46,032 --> 01:32:49,836
Hold up a second.
We are going to Tahiti.

1052
01:32:49,936 --> 01:32:53,173
We're gonna have a great time.
You are gonna forget everything.

1053
01:32:53,273 --> 01:32:56,042
Everything.
So just calm down.

1054
01:32:56,142 --> 01:32:58,779
I'm calm. Don't I
look... look at me.

1055
01:32:59,846 --> 01:33:01,782
See?

1056
01:33:01,882 --> 01:33:03,950
I just think it'd be better if you
went in the house, all right?

1057
01:33:04,050 --> 01:33:07,721
I'll get my cameras, then I'll be
straight back. Take your time, all right?

1058
01:33:07,821 --> 01:33:09,690
Man.

1059
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,725
You've gotta relax.
Hey, I'm relaxed.

1060
01:33:11,825 --> 01:33:14,895
You gotta calm down. Hey, man, I
don't want nothing else to go wrong.

1061
01:33:14,995 --> 01:33:19,332
Ronnie, come on now.

1062
01:33:19,432 --> 01:33:25,171
Veronica? Come on! We gotta be there
an hour and a half early to check in.

1063
01:33:25,271 --> 01:33:27,808
What are you doing?

1064
01:33:27,908 --> 01:33:31,077
Come on, Ronnie. Hey.

1065
01:33:32,846 --> 01:33:37,083
Ronnie, how long it take to get
some camera equipment, huh?

1066
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:48,762
Ronnie? Veronica?

1067
01:33:50,897 --> 01:33:53,800
What's that, Troy?
Is she out there?

1068
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:56,803
Is she? Watch it.

1069
01:33:56,903 --> 01:33:59,272
Hey, Veronica?

1070
01:34:13,486 --> 01:34:17,157
Roper, what's up?
What is it?

1071
01:34:29,836 --> 01:34:32,005
You missing something, roper?

1072
01:34:32,105 --> 01:34:34,440
I got it.

1073
01:34:34,541 --> 01:34:39,245
Now you got something that belongs
to me, and I want it back.

1074
01:34:39,345 --> 01:34:44,350
4:15 tomorrow. Mare island,
north entrance, off Dixon.

1075
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:46,953
You pull up to berth 16.

1076
01:34:47,053 --> 01:34:51,024
I so much as smell another cop, I'll be
sending you pieces of her for a month.

1077
01:34:55,295 --> 01:34:58,198
He's gonna kill her
no matter what.

1078
01:34:58,298 --> 01:35:00,433
If I take him those jewels,
he's gonna kill me and her.

1079
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:02,435
So what do you want to do?

1080
01:35:02,536 --> 01:35:05,238
Scott, we go back a long ways, but
you can't expect me to do this.

1081
01:35:05,338 --> 01:35:09,042
This guy is a psychopath, and he has Ronnie.
It's the only way I'm gonna get close to him.

1082
01:35:09,142 --> 01:35:11,244
Then go to the lieutenant or the D.
A. With it for Chrissakes!

1083
01:35:11,344 --> 01:35:13,914
This is my fucking job you're
asking me to lay on the line.

1084
01:35:14,014 --> 01:35:16,850
They're not gonna approve it, and you know that.
If I get the department involved, she's dead.

1085
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:19,720
This guy's a fucking maniac. He
killed Sam, and he'll kill her.

1086
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:22,856
I got one shot at this guy,
Frank. Alone.

1087
01:35:22,956 --> 01:35:26,259
Now what if it was Mary? You'd do the same
thing. You'd break every rule in the book.

1088
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:28,895
Wouldn't you?

1089
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:32,833
I just hope to god I never
have to make that decision.

1090
01:35:39,072 --> 01:35:42,142
This conversation
never happened.

1091
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:45,178
I never saw you today.

1092
01:35:47,013 --> 01:35:49,750
Now I gotta go take a leak.

1093
01:36:07,233 --> 01:36:09,302
This place is
an abandoned shipyard.

1094
01:36:09,402 --> 01:36:11,972
He's gonna be able to get a good
vantage point from anywhere.

1095
01:36:12,072 --> 01:36:14,240
There's cranes, abandoned
buildings, everything.

1096
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:17,077
He's gonna be able
to see everything we do.

1097
01:36:17,177 --> 01:36:19,846
You're gonna have to figure out
a way to sneak me in here.

1098
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,352
Korda!

1099
01:37:03,223 --> 01:37:05,491
Korda!

1100
01:37:05,592 --> 01:37:07,594
Roper!

1101
01:37:07,694 --> 01:37:10,263
Nice of you to make it.

1102
01:37:10,363 --> 01:37:12,265
Now take the jacket off
and put it on the hood.

1103
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:19,940
Good. Let's have a
look at that tarp.

1104
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:23,443
Under the tarp in the back.

1105
01:37:23,544 --> 01:37:26,479
Pull it back.
Pull it back!

1106
01:37:30,617 --> 01:37:34,187
Over there to your right.
You see that concrete block?

1107
01:37:34,287 --> 01:37:37,591
There's a radio on it.
Walk to it.

1108
01:37:37,691 --> 01:37:39,593
That's it.
Come on.

1109
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:43,063
Come on!
Come on.

1110
01:37:53,273 --> 01:37:57,544
Ah. Before you touch it,
you throw away your piece.

1111
01:38:03,216 --> 01:38:06,186
Good.
Your backup too.

1112
01:38:06,286 --> 01:38:08,622
Do it!

1113
01:38:16,062 --> 01:38:18,464
Pick up the bag.
Bring it to me.

1114
01:38:20,967 --> 01:38:24,104
You walk past those cranes
on your right.

1115
01:38:24,204 --> 01:38:26,172
You get to the end,
you make a left.

1116
01:38:26,272 --> 01:38:29,442
At the end of that building,
you go to your right.

1117
01:38:29,543 --> 01:38:32,646
Walk to building 36.

1118
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,663
That's it. Keep coming.

1119
01:39:56,763 --> 01:39:58,699
That's good.
Right there.

1120
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,336
Come on in.

1121
01:40:03,436 --> 01:40:05,471
Somebody's dying to say hello.

1122
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:13,246
Shit.

1123
01:40:28,662 --> 01:40:30,631
Scott!

1124
01:40:32,398 --> 01:40:36,036
Shit.
Hey.

1125
01:40:43,744 --> 01:40:46,246
Over to the table.

1126
01:40:59,425 --> 01:41:03,129
Open your shirt. I'm not wearin' a wire.
This is between me and you.

1127
01:41:03,229 --> 01:41:05,231
Fuck you.
Open the shirt.

1128
01:41:10,671 --> 01:41:12,606
Okay?

1129
01:41:15,408 --> 01:41:17,310
Where are you, McCall?

1130
01:41:17,410 --> 01:41:20,346
Right here, roper.

1131
01:41:23,717 --> 01:41:27,554
You satisfied?
Open the bag, dump it on the table.

1132
01:41:44,805 --> 01:41:47,608
Pick something up.
What?

1133
01:41:47,708 --> 01:41:50,511
Nope. Closer to the front
of the pile. There.

1134
01:41:50,611 --> 01:41:52,879
Let's go.

1135
01:41:52,979 --> 01:41:55,281
Stay put.

1136
01:42:15,335 --> 01:42:17,904
That's impressive.

1137
01:42:18,004 --> 01:42:21,642
What the fuck did you have to do,
steal 'em? Yeah, I stole it.

1138
01:42:21,742 --> 01:42:23,777
That ain't gonna look too good
on the ol' service record.

1139
01:42:23,877 --> 01:42:27,347
You let me worry about that. Let's just
get this shit over with, all right?

1140
01:42:27,447 --> 01:42:30,150
A man after my own heart.

1141
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:33,286
Here you go.
Fill it up.

1142
01:42:44,931 --> 01:42:48,669
Come on, man, bring him out.
Move him out.

1143
01:42:50,937 --> 01:42:53,306
Step up.

1144
01:42:57,578 --> 01:43:01,181
That's far enough.
Right there. Bag on the floor.

1145
01:43:01,281 --> 01:43:03,216
I'm not putting the bag
on the floor.

1146
01:43:03,316 --> 01:43:05,385
I took care of my part of this shit.
Now you let my girl go.

1147
01:43:05,485 --> 01:43:07,921
Scott, just do what he says!
Please, just do it!

1148
01:43:08,021 --> 01:43:10,490
Hey, Ronnie, relax. I'm
gonna get us out of here.

1149
01:43:10,591 --> 01:43:14,394
That I gotta see.
Just a little more.

1150
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:19,933
No! No! Scott!

1151
01:43:21,835 --> 01:43:25,205
Hey!

1152
01:43:25,305 --> 01:43:26,940
Back off.

1153
01:43:28,809 --> 01:43:31,277
Don't move.

1154
01:43:34,548 --> 01:43:36,617
Shit. Damn it.

1155
01:43:36,717 --> 01:43:40,253
I rewired this switch.
So you keep your finger...

1156
01:43:40,353 --> 01:43:42,255
On the red button.

1157
01:43:42,355 --> 01:43:44,490
Otherwise,
it gets kind of messy.

1158
01:43:44,591 --> 01:43:47,393
Such a nice neck too.

1159
01:43:47,493 --> 01:43:49,996
Shit.
Now walk to me.

1160
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:55,301
That's it.
Right there.

1161
01:43:55,401 --> 01:43:58,639
Right there.
Put the bag down.

1162
01:43:58,739 --> 01:44:03,710
Now, real nice, you
kick over what's mine.

1163
01:44:05,979 --> 01:44:09,449
Oh, no! Please, Scott!

1164
01:44:12,653 --> 01:44:15,822
Remember what I said?
Remember that?

1165
01:44:15,922 --> 01:44:21,728
When you think you're fuckin'
them, they're fuckin' you.

1166
01:44:21,828 --> 01:44:23,730
You just got fucked.

1167
01:44:28,001 --> 01:44:30,604
Gotta go.
Got a plane to catch.

1168
01:44:30,704 --> 01:44:33,607
Oh, shit, look at this.

1169
01:44:33,707 --> 01:44:37,944
Got my car here, and that's the
only exit, the only way out.

1170
01:44:38,044 --> 01:44:40,947
You're standing right
in front of it.

1171
01:44:41,047 --> 01:44:43,249
Now, you can move, but...

1172
01:44:53,159 --> 01:44:57,397
Scott, what's he doing?

1173
01:44:58,464 --> 01:45:00,634
Damn.

1174
01:45:14,515 --> 01:45:16,750
Scott, move.

1175
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:24,658
Get out of the way!
Do it now, Scott!

1176
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:30,063
McCall, stop the...
What car?

1177
01:45:34,568 --> 01:45:37,437
Please move!
Take a shot!

1178
01:46:05,766 --> 01:46:08,769
Come on, Scott! Please!

1179
01:46:16,877 --> 01:46:20,647
Come on!
Please, help me!

1180
01:46:32,458 --> 01:46:35,428
Come on, Scott!

1181
01:46:35,529 --> 01:46:37,163
Scott!

1182
01:47:28,749 --> 01:47:30,651
Stay in here.
No! Wh...

1183
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:33,053
Stay inside, Ronnie!
Stay here!

1184
01:47:40,994 --> 01:47:43,897
McCall!
He went around that way.

1185
01:47:43,997 --> 01:47:47,033
Fuck, man! How bad you hit?
He went down that way.

1186
01:47:47,133 --> 01:47:49,202
You all right?
I'm okay.

1187
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:52,105
Get him!

1188
01:49:32,172 --> 01:49:35,108
Hey!

1189
01:49:45,018 --> 01:49:49,956
Motherfucker!
Get the fuck open!

1190
01:50:56,089 --> 01:50:59,325
<i>♪ Oh, really?</i>
Nice, huh?

1191
01:50:59,425 --> 01:51:01,327
I'll show you.

1192
01:51:09,035 --> 01:51:13,974
I've never seen a sky so
blue and sea so clear.

1193
01:51:14,074 --> 01:51:18,344
This place is amazing.

1194
01:51:18,444 --> 01:51:23,183
Yep, I could really get used
to this paradise shit.

1195
01:51:23,283 --> 01:51:27,387
Oh, excuse me, miss. Can you
get me another Pina Colada,

1196
01:51:27,487 --> 01:51:30,190
and this time can you
shave the ice for me?

1197
01:51:30,290 --> 01:51:32,926
Oui, monsieur. Right away.
"Oui, monsieur. Right away."

1198
01:51:33,026 --> 01:51:34,961
That's very nice to hear.

1199
01:51:35,061 --> 01:51:37,330
Mademoiselle.
Oui, merci.

1200
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:40,466
"Mademoiselle." "oui,
merci."

1201
01:51:40,567 --> 01:51:43,203
Au revoir.
Au revoir.

1202
01:51:43,303 --> 01:51:46,072
That's some smooth shit, French.

1203
01:51:47,774 --> 01:51:50,110
Scott...

1204
01:51:50,210 --> 01:51:54,114
There's something really special
I want to talk to you about.

1205
01:51:54,214 --> 01:51:56,850
What's that?

1206
01:51:56,950 --> 01:52:01,387
I think it's time for this relationship
to go to another, deeper level.

1207
01:52:04,558 --> 01:52:06,492
A deeper level?

1208
01:52:06,593 --> 01:52:08,795
I think this is it.

1209
01:52:08,895 --> 01:52:12,198
Here and now,
we should strip down...

1210
01:52:12,298 --> 01:52:14,200
And get "nekked" in Tahiti.

1211
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:19,906
Oh, you talking about
getting naked in Tahiti.

1212
01:52:20,006 --> 01:52:22,909
I thought you was talking about the
"m" word just now when you was...

1213
01:52:23,009 --> 01:52:26,412
The "m" word? What did you think
I was talking about? You know.

1214
01:52:26,513 --> 01:52:29,149
What, marriage?

1215
01:52:29,249 --> 01:52:33,253
Why are you laughing? The way you said all
that we need to go to a deeper level.

1216
01:52:33,353 --> 01:52:36,089
But you did say that you would get
naked on the beach in Tahiti.

1217
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:38,058
No, I didn't say,
"naked on the beach in Tahiti."

1218
01:52:38,158 --> 01:52:40,827
I said, "let's get naked in Tahiti."
The hotel room is in Tahiti too.

1219
01:52:40,927 --> 01:52:43,029
I'm not gonna get naked on the beach.
You're a prude.

1220
01:52:43,129 --> 01:52:45,198
I'm not a prude. I'm just
not... these are strangers.

1221
01:52:45,298 --> 01:52:47,868
Prude.
I'm not getting naked on no beach.

1222
01:52:47,968 --> 01:52:51,204
We could go to the room, I'll take off
my clothes and run around naked for you.

1223
01:52:51,304 --> 01:52:55,542
Incidentally, that thong in the suitcase,
that's not getting worn on the beach. Sorry.

1224
01:52:55,642 --> 01:52:59,312
Yeah, I'm very disappointed. You didn't
even try it on, and I bought it for you.

1225
01:52:59,412 --> 01:53:02,448
That's for me? Imagine me
in some shit like that.

1226
01:53:02,549 --> 01:53:04,450
You actually bought that for me?

1227
01:53:04,551 --> 01:53:07,954
It would look cute on your ass.
Right. Yeah. Girl, please.

1228
01:53:08,054 --> 01:53:11,558
What if one of my mother's friends was here
and seen me walking around in that shit?

1229
01:53:11,658 --> 01:53:14,494
Don't bring your mother into this.
It's a small world.

1230
01:53:14,595 --> 01:53:17,263
Somebody that knows my mother,
sees me in that shit,

1231
01:53:17,363 --> 01:53:20,000
then they, "oh, girl, Mrs. Roper's
son be on the beach in Tahiti...

1232
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:22,002
"With his ass out
on his vacation.

1233
01:53:22,102 --> 01:53:25,438
Watch him, girl. Mm-hmm. I seen
he had a string up his ass."

1234
01:53:25,539 --> 01:53:29,042
Get the fuck outta here.
Not today.

1235
01:53:29,543 --> 01:53:33,079

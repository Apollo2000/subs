Uh, one.

- You put gas in it, propane.

329
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,690
If I had a gypsy in a van
and I opened the gas,

330
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,442
- will it finish him?
- Yeah, that-- Probably.

331

- Yeah.

her to be attract to...
top-level guy.

808
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,859
Well, what I would suggest is
that we do some simple things.

809
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,613
Like a little r-refinement
of the nose.

810
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,990
What’s wrong with my nose?

811
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,950
Do I look like a Jew?

812
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,827
No, ma’am. Not at all.

813
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,829
- (sighs heavily)
- (laughing)

814
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,956
- Oh, that...
- Because a Jew...

815
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,958
- Yeah, she was, uh, very sad.
- A Jew...

816
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,668
A Jew would be like this.

817
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:45,879
Jew nose more out,

818
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,633
out a bit more, down here,

819
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,551
then down a bit here,

820
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,553
bump, bump, in.

821
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,513
It can be that bad, yes.

822
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,057
- Mm.
- Then, if you like,

823
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,184
what I would suggest

824
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,436
is that maybe we put
some breast implants.

825
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,562
And what it mean, "breast"?

826
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:04,522
- The-the breast. Titty.
- Mm.

827
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:05,523
Titty?

828
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:06,942
- Titty.
- Titty?

829
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:07,943
Titty.

830
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,110
Titty?

831
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,613
- Titty.
- Or breast.

832
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,991
I want a man who wants
to make a sex attack on me.

833
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,202
Mm-hmm.

834
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,496
I think that would be most men.

835
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,831
Would you make a sex attack
with me?

836
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,126
Uh...

837
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,045
if your father was not here.

838
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,757
- Ooh.
- Ah! (chuckles)

839
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,469
- WOMAN: Hello.
- Hello.

840
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:39,015
So, altogether,
the total is $21,751.

841
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:41,309
How much?

842
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:44,229
$21,751.

843
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,107
- Tenge or dollar?
- Dollars.

844
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,525
(farts)

845
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:49,734
Okay.

846
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:53,321
- With the, uh, saline implant...
- Yes?

847
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:57,575
Um, could you take off
some money if instead, uh,

848
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,703
you use potatoes?

849
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,997
- Uh, we cannot use potatoes.
- Why not?

850
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,374
Because potatoes aren’t sterile.

851
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,917
This a very good potato.

852
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,877
But you cannot take a potato

853
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:10,088
- and put it in the body.
- Expensive one.

854
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,550
What if we allow, uh, perverts
in to watch the surgery?

855
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,051
Can we have reduction?

856
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:17,512
You can keep the money
that they pay you.

857
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,097
Uh, absolutely not.

858
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,808
The more people you bring in,
the more germs come in.

859
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,476
You cannot do that.

860
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,688
The perverts have to be
medical personnel.

861
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,441
They have to be
either a doctor or a nurse.

862
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,484
I want to make sure that, uh,

863
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,987
the man I give her to
is very happy

864
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,032
- and will not return her.
- Okay.

It will be tip-top.

867
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,454
It’ll be more than tip-top.

868
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,457
Are you able to pay
this amount? Yes? -Yes, I have.

869
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,126
Okay. Thank you.

Ooh.

873
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,676
That’s a lot of money,
but worth it.

874
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,929

Of course.

877

I will go home and you
will have new owner.

878
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,608
So I will never see you again?

00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:16,613

I think, with the Democrats,

with Obama-- and I think
it goes back to the Clintons--

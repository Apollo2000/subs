2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,512
Life's pretty simple, you know.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,153
It's long periods of waiting

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,470
broken up by brief moments of change.

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,554
That's it. That's all it is.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,716
You see, here's my theory.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,597
The moments of change?

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,314
They're what give your life its shape,

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,674
its form.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,950
But it only takes one of them to define you

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,793
and that'll be the only thing
you're remembered for,

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,029
and you know it.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,554
In the instant it happens, you sense it,

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,154
and the world is changed forever.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,430
You are forever changed.

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,675
All right, kids. See you later, all right?

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,512
- I love you.
- I love you too, Daddy.

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,749
Kiss. See you later.

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,512
- Love you, all right.
- Bye, Daddy.

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,434
All right? See you later.

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,748
Bye.

22
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,239
All right, mate, look, I'm loading!

23
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,594
Look, I'm loading.

24
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,830
Morning! Big fan, Mr. Harris!

25
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,112
I don't believe in no fate.

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,279
No karma, no coincidences,

27
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,794
no conspiracy theories
or any of that other bullshit.

28
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,358
Shit just happens. And life?

29
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,456
That's just the shit that happens

30
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,313
while you're wishing you were
someone or somewhere else.

31
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,719
Who were you chatting to?

32
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,631
No one, I was just on the phone.

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,399
What are you doing out there?

34
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,919
You ain't smoking again, are you?

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,719
No, come on, Mom.
You know I'm off that now.

36
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,280
It just gets a bit stuffy in my room.

37
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,753
Getting a bit of fresh air.

38
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,313
Ain't you forgetting something?

39
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,795
Head's up me ass today.

40
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,189
Here, I've even given them a clean and all.

41
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,400
Thanks, darling,
I don't know what I'd do without you.

42
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,776
Don't know why
you wear your boots anyway.

43
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,677
You only shout and moan on the sides.

44
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,354
What? I'm teaching them the beautiful game.

45
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,256
Anyway, I need my boots today
so I can run up and down

46
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,616
handing out your sponsorship forms

47
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,896
to them dads who are going to give you

48
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,680
loads of money for your charity.

49
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,438
Look, never mind them.

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,476
Just check if Ravi's heard any news.

51
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,632
Yeah, I will. I will.

52
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,039
Leave it with me.

53
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,834
Bye, darling.

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,075
Morning, gents! How are we all?

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,957
You all right? How you doing, Hal?

56
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,536
- Pretty good, mate. You?
- Good. Good to see ya.

57
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,629
How are ya?

58
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,176
Right, I've got a very, very important
announcement from the missus.

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,317
She's doing a fun run for, uh,
disabled kids.

60
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,856
The fun part is going to be watching her

61
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,075
and her lumpy pals
run around Battersea for an hour.

62
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,798
But...

63
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,440
Could you, uh, do what you can for her?

64
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,198
- Okay.
- Yeah? Thanks very much, guys.

65
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,474
Cheers. Cheers.

66
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,396
All right, Ravi? Any news, mate?

67
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,756
- Don't worry. All the references are sorted.
- Right.

68
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,518
Exciting times, huh?

69
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,631
That's fantastic. Thank you, mate.

70
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,376
- Thank you so much.
- Not a problem, mate.

71
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,072
Yeah, she's going to be well chuffed.

72
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,116
It means a lot to us. Thank you, Rav.

73
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,235
Right, lads! Over here, please!

74
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,833
Are you okay?

75
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,876
Yeah. Why?

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,750
You just seem a little bit distracted.

77
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,553
I'm okay.

78
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,913
I just wish I didn't have to sneak around,

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,513
be so secretive.

80
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,280
He's the one that was screwing the nanny.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,355
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

82
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,112
It's all right. I just...

83
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,996
I don't really need you to remind me.

84
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,957
Sorry, excuse me. I'm just gonna...

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,712
I'm just gonna...

86
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,639
So...

87
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,270
I found this the other day.

88
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,031
Oh, my God.

89
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,096
Do you remember that night?

90
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,678
That's the first night I met you.

91
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,714
- Yes, it was.
- It was.

92
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,313
And you haven't changed a bit.

93
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,239
Yeah, right.

94
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,473
Shame it's 10 years and two kids later.

95
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,230
Well, have you thought about
getting back into it?

96
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,436
- Acting?
- Mmm-hmm.

97
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,954
- No.
- Why not?

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,996
I wouldn't know how to go about it.

99
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,913
There's got to be someone
that you can call,

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,592
point you in the right direction.

101
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,037
I can take some new headshots for you,

102
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,597
get a couple of, like,
really moody, 10x8s,

103
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,795
really actory ones.

104
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,273
- Hey. Kids get off okay?
- Yes, all good.

105
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,918
Evie took ages to get off, though.

106
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,190
- Oh, I'll go and check on her.
- Listen, Emily...

107
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,080
Uh, you're supposed to call first.

108
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,954
I did, but you were obviously busy, so...

109
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
What do you want?

110
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,712
Well, a signed shirt
from the loft and kiss our children,

111
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,835
is that all right?

112
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,280
Off you go then. Your audience awaits.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,399
- Don't you fancy it?
- No.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,558
Goodbye, Max.

115
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,631
Good evening again, ladies and gents.

116
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,278
A bit of quiet please,

117
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,636
because it's time to meet
the man of the moment.

118
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,438
Please welcome to the stage our host,

119
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,196
former England rugby captain, a true hero,

120
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,353
and our very own gladiator, Maximus Moore.

121
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,794
Thank you, Dan.

122
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,056
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

123
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,150
As my grandmother once said,

124
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,676
"It's always good to have
a warm hand on your opening."

125
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,791
Um, in all seriousness,

126
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,791
thank you so much
for supporting our foundation.

127
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,395
You know, our aim is to raise
even more money

128
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,950
and encourage those less fortunate
than ourselves to play rugby

129
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,714
and perhaps learn
the disciplines of working on a team.

130
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,792
So, uh, sit back and we'll run the VT

131
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,280
of some of our fantastic work
that we've been doing. Cheers.

132
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,434
- Say cheese.
- Cheese!

133
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,713
- Nice one.
- Thanks, girls.

134
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

135
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,955
- See ya.
- Later.

136
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,357
- Bye, Max. See ya.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,874
Are you sure?

138
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,678
Mate, I ain't getting any at home, am I?

139
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,154
You think she's still seeing
that photographer bloke?

140
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,753
Cunt.

141
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,353
So, what're you gonna do?

142
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,576
Well, I'll see how she likes it

143
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,272
when her credit card gets stopped, yeah?

144
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,634
- Seriously?
- Yeah, mate.

145
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,990
Listen, call your mate
and get him to grab some gear.

146
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,433
Oh, yeah.

147
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,640
And I'll sort those two out.

148
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,599
Sorry, I don't think
that picture came out really well.

149
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,399
- It's dead in here, B.
- Fam, this action's shit!

150
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,472
Hey, yo, let's go hit VIP.

151
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,677
What? Mate, do you think we can get in?

152
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,790
Watch. Let me deal with this, you know?

153
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,074
- Yeah.
- Come.

154
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,072
Say no more.

155
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,755
Wah gwan?

156
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,915
You got a stamp?

157
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,348
Hey, look, yeah?

158
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,629
I don't think so.

159
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,800
This ain't for your type, little man.

160
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,316
Wh... We've been invited, mate.
We're on a table.

161
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,357
- Trust me.
- I don't think so.

162
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,153
And you stink of weed.

163
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,357
So, you need to leave the club now.

164
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,835
Hey, come on, brother.
Where's your empathy?

165
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,390
I don't know you, and you ain't my brother.

166
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,439
- So step aside...
- Yeah, we don't wanna fucking know you!

167
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,631
Mandingo fucking prick!

168
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,433
Fucking dickhead! Fuck you, man!

169
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,875
Idiots!

170
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,788
Fucking wanker!

171
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,915
Shit!

172
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Come here!

173
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,949
Get the fuck off me, man!

174
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,518
Get the fuck off him!

175
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,108
Hey! Leave him! Leave him the fuck alone!

176
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,074
Get the fuck off me.

177
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,788
Get the fuck off me.

178
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,112
Get off me!

179
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,635
Get off me!

180
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,751
Look what the cat's dragged in, eh?

181
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,991
What've you done to your face?

182
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,150
Mom, Mom, it's nothing. Just slipped.

183
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,456
Had a couple of drinks n' that.

184
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,198
- Who was you with?
- My boy Sean, innit?

185
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,633
Well, that boy's got brains.

186
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,989
I bet he didn't get himself
into such a condition.

187
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,753
That's going to look
great in job interviews.

188
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,239
Mom, it's fine. Trust me.

189
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,389
Just make sure you get Amelia
to church on time.

190
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,592
What do you say, shorty. You ready, yeah?

191
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,795
You smell.

192
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,000
"Immediate return to court order..."

193
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,877
Hey! That's none of your business.

194
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,911
- You going back to prison?
- What?

195
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,877
No. Of course not.

196
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,776
Look, I'll just take a pregnant white chick
to court

197
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,358
and they'll give me community service.

198
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,155
Hey.

199
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,430
I ain't ever going back there, you know?

200
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,315
I promise you.

201
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
Now, come on.

202
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,035
Let's go before we both
get in trouble, yeah?

203
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,228
"Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia..."

204
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,955
"The Gods themselves
throw incense."

205
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,189
Must be, what, um,
four years since we did Lear together?

206
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,554
- Eight years ago.
- Oh!

207
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,551
That's the price you pay
for those thunderous thighs

208
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,278
and the glamorous life of a WAG.

209
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,994
How is, uh, Mr. Neanderthal?

210
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,033
Being a royal pain.

211
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,236
Yes, that's why
you're here, I suppose?

212
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,435
You miss me.

213
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,472
You've finally succumbed to my...

214
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,990
My, uh, mature charm.

215
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,116
Mmm, something like that.

216
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,673
It's not easy with a family, I'm sure,

217
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,154
but we make our choices.

218
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,437
Yeah, but it'll be good
for me to be working again.

219
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,238
For everyone, you know?

220
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,992
Keep me off the happy pills.

221
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,839
We're all the same, you know.

222
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,040
Without our passion,

223
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,590
it's very hard for us
to find our place in the world.

224
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,958
That aimed at him or me?

225
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,278
Now, I'm delighted I can help.

226
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,108
I always hoped you'd be back.

227
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,189
Consider it done.

228
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,391
Don't worry about it. It'll be all right.

229
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,754
Fingers crossed, eh?

230
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,760
Otherwise it'll be more than
a fucking broomstick she shoves up me.

231
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,160
I'm really sorry, madam,
but the system's saying, "Card declined."

232
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,677
Leo, give me my phone. Give me...

233
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,637
Sorry. Thanks.

234
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,119
For fuck's sake, Max,
I couldn't even get a present

235
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,997
for the kid's birthday party.

236
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,479
You said you'd set up the account.

237
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,312
You said you'd transferred my allowance!

238
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,713
Stop trying to control me!

239
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,468
Hold my hand, Leo.

240
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,159
Hi. Come in.

241
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,856
- How are you?
- Not too bad. Yourself?

242
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,393
- Very well.
- Good, good.

243
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,478
I know you've both done good work

244
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,630
in the preparation group classes

245
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,358
and it's been a long six months,

246
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,668
but we're nearly there now.

247
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,718
I don't know
why you don't just make us wait

248
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,189
the full nine like the real thing.

249
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,554
Our assessment's all but done,

250
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,518
and Dr. Ravi Buttar's reference
was first-class.

251
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,079
He really respects you, George.

252
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,668
Oh!

253
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,189
I should play his son up-front every week.

254
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,956
One minor issue has reared
its ugly head, though, I'm afraid, guys.

255
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,950
A couple of arrests in your teens, George.

256
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,314
Football hooliganism?

257
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,515
You assured us of full disclosure.

258
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,709
That was years ago.
I mean, I was only a kid.

259
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,394
Youthful exuberance,
I think they called it.

260
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,150
Common assault and disturbing the peace

261
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,521
can be seen by some as more than
a misspent youth, George.

262
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,832
No, I mean, literally, it was 30 years ago.

263
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,996
West Ham ain't won a trophy since.

264
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,616
I think what my better
half is trying to say

265
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,400
is that having played
up a bit in his teens,

266
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,640
he will be experienced enough

267
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,920
to make sure that our kid knows

268
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,110
the pitfalls of hanging
out with wrong 'uns.

269
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,800
Yeah, and I've met plenty of wrong 'uns.

270
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,988
To be honest,
we're both so nervous today, and, um...

271
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,030
All we want is what everyone else has

272
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,429
and to give all the love we have to a baby

273
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,839
who deserves and needs it.

274
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,998
We just want to be given a chance.

275
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,634
That's all.

276
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,278
Kathy.

277
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,429
Kath!

278
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,795
Hi, Jake.

279
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,749
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,998
Actually, um, I thought about
what you said the other day

281
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,311
and, um, guess who I had lunch with today?

282
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,154
Um, my actor friend, Terence Harris.

283
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,312
No, no, not like that.

284
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,995
- But he did say that he'd help me...
- Daddy's here!

285
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,536
- My kids are here!
- Daddy! Daddy!

286
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,437
Can I call you back?
Um, I'll tell you later.

287
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,559
In about an hour? Yeah.

288
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,236
Da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da!

289
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,072
Mommy, look what Daddy bought us!

290
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,673
Wow, that's great!

291
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,113
Why don't you open them outside?

292
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,555
Because Mommy
needs to talk to Daddy in private.

293
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,392
Well, that makes a change.

294
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,476
Go on, I'll be in there
in a second, all right?

295
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,152
Okay, okay.

296
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,549
You might be able to
manipulate your groupies

297
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,438
and your so-called mates,
and even your own kids,

298
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
but not me, Max,

299
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,200
not since you shat on your own doorstep.

300
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,136
What is going on,
that's why I gave you your own space...

301
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,639
Look, I haven't finished!

302
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,112
How dare you humiliate me like that
in front of my own kids?

303
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,720
Like what? What are you talking about?

304
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,976
Like what? Is this about the money?

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,096
Of course it's about the money.

306
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,400
All right, okay, fine, you know,

307
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,496
I lost my credit card, okay?

308
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,953
And they put a block on it.

309
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,776
And I realized that you
might come up short,

310
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,190
so I went to the bank
and got you some cash. Here you go.

311
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,868
That's why I came round today,

312
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,633
to make sure you and the kids were okay.

313
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,469
Um...

314
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,554
Em, come on,
you didn't think I would just, like,

315
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,676
leave you hanging, did ya?

316
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,028
You did, didn't ya?

317
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,238
Right, you lot! Where are you?

318
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,550
Where are you?
What you doing here, hiding?

319
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,520
You know what
my life's about right now?

320
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,075
It's all about the blocks,

321
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,789
dirty great towers
that have stood firm for two generations,

322
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,838
full of initiated kids who'll be dead
before they grow old.

323
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,028
Grim towers and hopeless kids.

324
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,550
"For the first 10 days
they sailed on beautifully

325
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,349
"and found plenty to eat,
as there was lots of fish.

326
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,954
"And they had only to take them
out of the sea

327
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,113
"with a long spoon
when the quangle wangle..."

328
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,079
What's a quangle wangle?

329
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,556
God, I miss putting those kids to bed.

330
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,276
And sleeping next to you, of course.

331
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,000
We gonna go to the Chelsea Ball next week?

332
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,115
No.

333
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,309
Come on...

334
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,915
Do you actually ever stop
to think about why I hate those events?

335
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,878
They worship you and...

336
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,318
Don't even notice me.

337
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,910
Well, it is those events
that pay the bills.

338
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,275
Oh, this is new.

339
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,475
Look at you, man.

340
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,198
What's this about?

341
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,080
Oh, that must have been
the cleaner, I think.

342
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,758
We've been having a bit of sort out.

343
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,955
It wasn't on purpose.

344
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,155
Ems...

345
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,598
I made a mistake.

346
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,153
You made more than one.

347
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,033
I know I did. I know.

348
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,954
And I'm truly sorry about it. Okay?

349
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,896
But how long do we
have to keep on going like this?

350
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,751
- It's killing me...
- It's not a game.

351
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,513
And I'm sure you are sorry,
but I'm not ready.

352
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,794
I need more time.

353
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,879
It's not all about you.

354
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,376
As long as the credit cards work,
though, right?

355
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,913
It's about our kids.

356
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,350
And I'm gonna be working soon.
So, I'll have my own money.

357
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,556
I didn't mean that, like... Oh...

358
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,952
I'm sorry about that. I don't mean that.

359
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,073
Ems, look, I...

360
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,793
I stopped playing.

361
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,839
I lost my parents.

362
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,114
And I'm really turned round.

363
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,715
All I really had left
was you and my kids, okay?

364
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,119
And I miss you.

365
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,558
Ems, I'm sorry.

366
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,399
I just want you back.

367
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,755
Ta.

368
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,675
Here, sweetheart.

369
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,393
- Cheers, George.
- Thank you. Cheers.

370
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,594
Now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

371
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
will you please welcome

372
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,150
Battersea's favorite
singing cabbie, George!

373
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,080
Go on, George!

374
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,475
Good evening, Wembley!

375
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,554
No matter where I roam

376
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,839
I will return to my English rose

377
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,717
For no bonds

378
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,756
Can ever keep me from she

379
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,079
I've sailed the seven seas

380
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
I've flown the whole blue sky

381
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,797
But I return with haste

382
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,913
To where my love does lie

383
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,589
No matter where I go

384
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,639
I will come back to my English rose

385
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,109
For no one

386
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,510
Can ever tempt me from she...

387
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,918
I've searched the secret mists

388
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,314
I've climbed the highest peaks

389
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,193
I've caught the wild wind home

390
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,634
To hear her soft voice speak

391
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,473
No matter where I roam

392
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,076
I will return to my English rose

393
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,878
For no bonds

394
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,032
Can ever keep me from she

395
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,477
I've been to ancient worlds

396
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,039
I've scoured the whole universe

397
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,992
And caught the first train home

398
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,428
To be at her side

399
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,753
No matter where I roam

400
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,192
I will return to my English rose

401
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,395
For no one

402
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,113
No nothing

403
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,996
No bonds can ever keep me

404
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,832
From she

405
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,869
You all right?

406
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,879
I think you should go.

407
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,874
It was a mistake.

408
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,256
You've got what you came for,
and my money's on the counter.

409
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,952
Oh, stop it. Come on. Let's just talk.

410
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,792
If we could talk,

411
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,632
we wouldn't be where we are now.

412
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,949
You just treat everything
like it's a match you can't lose.

413
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,235
Please... Please, Max, will you go?

414
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,115
A mistake?

415
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,871
Darling? Cup of tea for you there.

416
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,230
Good luck today, all right?

417
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,072
I got money on you winning this.

418
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,396
Thanks, love, but I keep telling ya,
it ain't a bloody race.

419
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,118
No. Of course it ain't.

420
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,709
See you later.

421
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,473
Oh, and don't you be late.

422
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,949
I won't.

423
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,160
- Excuse me.
- Hold this, yeah?

424
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,550
Dom, what the fuck is wrong with you?

425
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,551
- Get off the man's car!
- Thanks. Thank you.

426
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,115
You fucking idiot. Man, how stupid are you?

427
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,919
- Come on, man.
- Bruv,

428
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,200
when are you going to grow up?

429
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,679
How many times have I told you?

430
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,376
You're supposed to be selling this,
not smoking it,

431
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,753
you little prick.

432
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,995
Where the fuck is your ped? Huh?

433
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,115
That's... That's all I could tief, innit?

434
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,514
You're some dickhead, you know.

435
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,431
Man, this is why you don't get no chicks.

436
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,556
What? Bruv, you know I got bare girls.

437
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,120
Man, I got my dick sucked last night.

438
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,878
- What do you know?
- Please.

439
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,428
I swear down, bruv. She sucked me off.

440
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,590
She asked why I didn't have
no hair down there.

441
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,035
Told her I had alopecia. Spot me.

442
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,317
Fucking...

443
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,828
Yo, make sure
you don't get the bag this time.

444
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,079
Where the fuck these freshman at?

445
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,038
Been waiting for this shit all day, cuz.

446
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,235
My young Gs.

447
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,869
Tonight's the night.

448
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,869
It's initiation time.

449
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,637
So, you best grab them peds
and ride 'em for real.

450
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,360
Wait till some cunt flashes you up, yeah?

451
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,836
Then you fuck him up! You get me?

452
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,109
Something wrong, Kingsley?

453
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,754
Seriously?

454
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,160
Man, why are we still troubling them
that ain't on nothin'?

455
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,640
It's about trust and loyalty, innit?

456
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,256
And don't be thinking
I don't need no proof, you know.

457
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,998
That's why God invented the iPhone.

458
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,715
Come on then!

459
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,160
You still don't fucking get it, do you?

460
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,589
We need the young 'uns
out on the road making dough,

461
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,716
not getting bagged for some dead crime.

462
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,356
Ain't you got somewhere
you're supposed to be?

463
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,320
I don't care how tough you think you are

464
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,998
or what you've done to get here

465
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,758
or what you do when you're not here.

466
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,469
You're here to work.

467
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,073
Don't worry, love.
I'm on me way. You crack on.

468
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,119
Excuse me?

469
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,115
- Mate, sorry. I'm done for the day.
- Your light's on.

470
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,992
I only live over the bridge.

471
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,314
Go on then, mate. Jump in.

472
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,869
- Where you going?
- Halsey Street, please.

473
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,275
Excuse me?

474
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,556
Would you mind giving me a hand?

475
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,718
- What?
- Hand.

476
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,960
You've got a pair of them
at the end of your arms.

477
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,628
You're supposed to be paying back
your community, aren't you?

478
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Okay.

479
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,999
There you are.

480
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,158
While you're here,

481
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,198
some mulch would be most useful.

482
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,068
- What's...
- Mulch.

483
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,275
Bark mulching.

484
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,351
You've got a mountain
of it beside your hut.

485
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,269
Uh...

486
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,918
I'll make it worth your while.

487
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,195
Look, man, I'm... I'm done for the day.

488
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,599
I'm literally about to roll out.

489
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,394
You look tired.

490
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,428
You okay?

491
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,873
Yeah, I'm fine.

492
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,798
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

493
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,278
All right, look.

494
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,033
I've got something that
should cheer you up.

495
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,318
- Marrakech?
- Mmm-hmm.

496
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,072
Imagine it, the two of us,

497
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,912
we'll actually be rocking the Casbah.

498
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,190
- Listen, Jake, I can't.
- Only for two nights.

499
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,759
I can't just bugger off on a whim.

500
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,559
- I'm not a student anymore.
- It's two nights.

501
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,835
The kids have got stuff on.
I've got work on.

502
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,480
And... And I've got to think about Max.

503
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,357
Ugh, Max!

504
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,670
Max. Why's it always about Max?

505
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,736
Emily, he's fucked you over.
Why can't you see that?

506
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,795
Don't be like that, Jake.

507
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,277
It's not a competition between you two.

508
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,150
I really don't need this
at the moment.

509
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,880
It was a nice thought, though.

510
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,274
Good man.

511
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,590
You moved quicker
than you have done all afternoon.

512
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,395
Here's a thank you for your kindness.

513
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,313
Oh, no, no, man. It's cool.
I don't want your money.

514
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,151
A good deed brightens a dark world.

515
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,356
So, would you like me to do
anything else for you while I'm here?

516
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,032
Two curses of the modern world,

517
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,236
sarcasm and the empty gesture.

518
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,714
No, you're all done for today.

519
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,080
Save your next job for tomorrow.

520
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,798
We pay all the taxes
and we're the bloody pariahs.

521
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,269
There are jobs. People don't want to work.

522
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,030
You know, if it wasn't for people like me,

523
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,151
this country would be totally fucked.

524
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,033
Big night out, was it?

525
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,600
Oh, fucking hell!

526
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,235
What the fuck?

527
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,599
Love, you all right?

528
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,718
Love? You all right?

529
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,314
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

530
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,109
Darling, you okay? Darling? Love?

531
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,976
You seen, mate.
She just stepped out in front of me.

532
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,719
I... Have you got a phone?
Ring an ambulance.

533
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,155
Anyone know first aid?
I... I don't know what to do.

534
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,633
I don't know what to do.

535
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,831
Can you hear me?

536
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,336
What you are doing here
today by giving up your time

537
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,191
and raising sponsorship money

538
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,352
will make a lot
of children's lives so much better.

539
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,711
So, thank you so much for doing this.

540
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,478
I hope you have a great day.

541
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,676
And off you go, on the three.

542
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,349
One, two, three!

543
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,756
I was sitting in the back seat...

544
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,270
Where the hell are you? I did it.

545
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,751
Now, get your slippery, fat ass here
and take me home.

546
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,070
Well, we might as well
have a quick drink first.

547
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,399
Hey, we did it, yeah!

548
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,276
Kingsley. I went by the graveyard, fam.

549
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,896
Boss man said you'd left, though, innit.

550
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,275
How's it picking up
them weeds, though, fam?

551
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,749
Must be long still. Oi, you tell Jules yet?

552
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,193
Nah, man, that's my business.

553
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,111
That don't affect big man's business.

554
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,270
Yeah, I know, but he's mad para, innit?

555
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,113
About feds and snitching, fam.
Need to fix up...

556
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,713
Why the fuck you always setting shit?

557
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,035
Jules knows I'm the one
that brings in the piece.

558
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,112
You're just the muscle.
Some innie knucklehead.

559
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,192
And to think you used to be someone
to me, man.

560
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,696
You know, there's more to life
than the blocks

561
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,920
and messing with the youngers.

562
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,954
Hey...

563
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,336
You're embarrassing me!

564
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,873
You're embarrassing me!

565
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
Let's go.

566
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,672
All right, Granddad?

567
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,630
No, no...

568
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,318
Hey, we're just having a laugh.

569
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,630
In we go, Max, that's where we go.
In we go.

570
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,313
That's it.

571
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,549
Mom!

572
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,272
- Just give me your keys.
- What?

573
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,720
Mom, what you being like this for?

574
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,359
- Mom!
- I found it.

575
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,351
- Give me your keys.
- Hey, Mom, Mom, calm down.

576
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,512
- Let me explain.
- Keys, now!

577
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,874
Wait, listen to me, Mom.

578
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,515
Mom!

579
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,548
Mom.

580
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,595
Fuck.

581
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,760
All right, thank you. Thank you, gentlemen.

582
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,352
And here, oh, listen, yeah... Here, look...

583
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,437
I will... I will sort you out, all right?

584
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,158
Here's my business card.

585
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,151
I will make sure... Oh...

586
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,916
Let's get rid of that. Uh...

587
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,468
Look, but no. Tickets, eh?

588
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,709
You know I'll sort you out.

589
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,234
So, there you go. Thank you.

590
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,199
Max, you were a legend, mate.
Sort yourself out.

591
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,834
Yeah, well...

592
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,074
I can't be a legend

593
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,513
because I'm not dead yet.

594
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,274
Go on. Go to bed.

595
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,394
Ooh!

596
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,991
And I don't know if you even notice at all

597
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,038
That I'm long gone, baby

598
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,596
And the things that keep us apart
keep me alive

599
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,918
The things that keep me alive

600
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,228
Keep me alone...

601
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,896
Hiya.

602
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,990
Hey. It's me.

603
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,957
This is the thing

604
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,316
This is the thing

605
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,314
Oh, fuck.

606
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,069
What's going on?

607
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,948
Um... I gotta go, all right?

608
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,268
I'll call you later.

609
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,755
Shit.

610
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,309
Was this your pops?

611
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,310
Oh, no, no.
No, it was an old friend.

612
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,637
You could call him my mentor.

613
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,816
There's nothing I'm doing right now

614
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,640
that I'd even want to
put on there, you know.

615
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,439
Well, keep in mind
that all our lives amount to

616
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:10,513
is that little dash on your headstone

617
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,114
between the date of your birth
and your death.

618
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,911
That stands for everything we ever were.

619
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,896
Well, that was
a full-blooded 40 minutes, wasn't it?

620
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,480
Max, as a former international captain,

621
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,748
you must have just loved it.

622
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,272
I thought that the...

623
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,788
Very entertaining first half, you know?

624
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,189
The, um... Both packs...

625
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,357
Uh, dominant.

626
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,358
And, um... Oh...

627
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,360
Okay,
we'll come back to you in just a sec.

628
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,640
Kyran, what were your thoughts?

629
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,398
Yeah, it was very entertaining.
The first minute, the try...

630
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,240
Probably the quickest try
in international rugby we've ever seen.

631
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,315
So as Max has said, just got to make sure
that we keep the tempers down.

632
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,656
I think the referee's doing a good job.

633
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,829
The yellow card is probably

634
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,319
the right thing to keep it calm.

635
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,536
Huge audience watching.

636
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,840
- It's not just...
- Yeah.

637
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,296
What the fuck you doing, Max?

638
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,675
You need to take a good look
in the mirror, seriously.

639
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,479
Do you know how many people
were watching this?

640
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,073
Millions, that's how many.

641
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,720
Jerome. Mate, listen...

642
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,594
No, just go home and call me
when you're compos mentis, okay?

643
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,237
It ain't some big conspiracy,

644
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,878
and it ain't no cover-up.

645
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,998
Shit just happens,
and you just gotta accept that.

646
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,153
They say everyone's equal
in the eyes of the law,

647
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,748
but that don't mean the law
treats everyone equally.

648
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,630
Injustice, natural disasters,
9/11, the war on terror.

649
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,678
Shit just happens, man.

650
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,918
Yeah, I... I mean, like,
it's not a poem or a rap or anything.

651
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,116
It's... I just got some
shit to say, you know?

652
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,952
Well, whatever it is,

653
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,560
it's spoken like a true professional.

654
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,232
Yeah, well, I've been writing.

655
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,631
Them headphones are hard, you know?

656
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,638
- Better than mine, at least.
- Well...

657
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,760
What are you listening to?

658
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,555
Here you are.

659
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,392
Hey, what?

660
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,835
Nina Simone, yeah? All right.

661
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,520
This is my mom's kind of shit, you know.

662
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,071
"Please don't let be misunderstood."

663
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,673
Written for her in 1964.

664
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,479
I was 10.

665
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,357
I say what you need is a room of one's own,

666
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,357
somewhere to write,
somewhere where you can be inspired.

667
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,074
I think it's high time
you joined me on the beach.

668
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,232
Hey, it's me.

669
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,518
Um, I just called to check you're okay

670
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,319
and say sorry
I was a bit harsh the other night.

671
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,076
Oh, yeah, and Evie wanted to say hi.

672
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,912
- Go on.
- Hi, Daddy.

673
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,270
Where are you? I miss you, Daddy.

674
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,715
And Leo's being a real pain.

675
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,190
He took one of my hair clips
and put it in the bin.

676
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,713
And now I can't find it,

677
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,518
and he won't help me look for it.

678
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,591
Okay, Evie, that's enough.

679
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,871
Call us back when you can, okay?

680
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,628
Hey, who's that?

681
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,358
Say, Granddad,

682
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,296
you look like you trying
to get to home or something?

683
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,912
Listen, you got the time?

684
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,999
Uh, no.

685
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,976
Come on, you must have a cigarette for me

686
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,479
or something so I can get a spliff.

687
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,919
Or a chip.

688
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,069
- Listen, pops.
- My guy.

689
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,320
Don't worry,
we're not going to, like, steal your shit.

690
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,753
Just being, um, friendly.

691
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,152
- Sorry, I didn't get that.
- Oh, he's taking the piss.

692
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,353
Friendly. Anyways, what you listening to?

693
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,476
- Let me check these out.
- No. I don't think so.

694
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,636
Oh, hey, man's got a new iPod n'at.

695
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,960
Man's up to date with his shit.

696
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,433
Up to date.

697
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,320
Say, we give this guy a Dre Beats or what?

698
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,513
Yeah, fuck it. Come on.

699
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,875
Trying to diss me, pops?

700
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,632
- Yeah?
- Let him go!

701
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,433
- Yeah, eff him up.
- What are you doing? Stop!

702
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,511
Fuck him up.

703
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,638
Fucking dissing me, pops?

704
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,555
Stop him! Stop!

705
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,312
Let it go, bruv. Let it go.

706
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,816
Why'd you stop recording?
Daniel'll be proud.

707
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,718
Fuck that, man! Beat! We gotta go, bruv!

708
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,279
Fuck this old fuck.

709
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,599
- I won!
- My turn.

710
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,348
There you are.

711
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,789
Bells, Bells,
could you just take that in for one sec?

712
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,472
- I'll be a minute.
- Hey.

713
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,195
What are you doing?

714
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,776
I'm sorry. You've not been taking my calls.

715
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,119
Yeah, I've been busy.

716
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,896
You can't just turn up here
without a warning.

717
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,876
- I know. I know. I know.
- You know that.

718
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:59,074
But I just put together some photos,
old-school style,

719
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,674
and I thought you might like it.

720
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,110
That's really sweet, Jake.

721
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,760
I've just got too much
to think about right now.

722
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,589
Yeah.

723
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,590
We've always been

724
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,908
so good together, you know?

725
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,956
And we missed our chance before,

726
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,429
and I just don't want us to miss it again.

727
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,593
What's happened?

728
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,478
Emily, you're not back with him.

729
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,559
I love you.

730
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,311
I think I've always loved you, probably.

731
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,958
Since the first time that I met you.

732
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,759
Jake, please. Don't. Please.

733
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,873
I did... I warned you.
It's just too complicated.

734
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,992
And you know my life's more than just
kisses and playlists.

735
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,554
I'm sorry.

736
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,273
Hey, I've been looking
all over the place for you.

737
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,395
You didn't say...

738
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,349
Hey, what the fuck?

739
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,197
Ah, some kids, you know.

740
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,548
They wanted my headphones.

741
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,119
It was my own fault.

742
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,553
It was late. It was getting dark.

743
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,080
- What'd they look like?
- Just kids.

744
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,435
And... And you're not hunting them down.

745
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,433
- Nah, man...
- That's not your life any longer.

746
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,474
- You've been to hospital?
- No. I'm all right, honestly.

747
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,273
No, it's just cuts.
Bruises, you know, just...

748
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,917
Thirty years in one square mile.

749
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,191
Not so much as a stolen wallet.

750
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,753
But in the greater scheme of things,

751
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,114
doesn't really matter anyway.

752
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,671
"A thousand landmarks perish

753
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,991
"A hundred streets grow strange

754

"He changes not at all."

762
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,880
I wasn't sure if I was going to see you

763
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,349
until your next misdemeanor.

764
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,833
So I've been...

765
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,709
Carrying this around.

766
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,595
There's a phone number.

767
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,598
Call that person and tell them I sent you.

768
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,680
Thanks.

769
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,078
- And breathe, remember.
- Yeah.

770
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,355
Hey, go get yourself checked out, okay?

771
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,880
Breathe from deep within.

772
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,513
All right. See you later, yeah?

773
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,718
- What's this then, bruv?
- Move, man.

774
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,109
- Was that a love letter, fam?
- My business.

775
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,719
Your business is my business, cuz.

776
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,120
Big man Jules wants to see you anyways.

777
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,475
What? Why's he telling you?

778
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,637
What you been saying?

779
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,159
Nothin', fam.

780
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,196
I'm just a knucklehead. Remember that.

781
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,439
Best go see him, though.

782
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,960
Okay, then, Kingsley,

783
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,560
what monologue are you
going to do for us today?

784
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,232
It's called "The Bush."

785
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,118
It's... It's from the Australian film
Animal Kingdom,

786
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,791
but I kind of made up my own version,

787
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,776
if that's all right, I mean...

788
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,870
Yeah! Sounds perfect.

789
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,034
Okay.

790
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,032
You know what the blocks are about?

791
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,190
It's about dirty towers
that have stood firm for two generations,

792
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,430
and kids who'll die before they grow old.

793
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,829
Grim towers and hopeless kids.

794
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,792
And everybody knows their place
in the scheme of things.

795
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,316
Everything, everyone,
sits in the order of the blocks.

796
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,150
Now, some survive 'cause they're strong,

797
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,593
and there are those who are weak,

798
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,672
but they survive 'cause they're
being protected by the strong.

799
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,317
See, because of the circles I move in,

800
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,960
I thoug ht I was one of the strong ones.

801
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,431
But I'm not.

802
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,635
I'm one of the weak ones.

803
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,113
And the only reason I've survived

804
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,350
is 'cause I'm being
protected by the strong.

805
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,954
Run like Kingsley.

806
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,871
Long time, brother.

807
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,953
Yeah, man. We saying you good, yeah?

808
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,469
Mmm.

809
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,834
Sit down then.

810
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,840
We've been hearing you got some issues
and you want out.

811
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,712
All of a sudden you're better than us?

812
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,056
Yo, no, man, come on,
it's not even like that...

813
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,718
- So, what is it like then?
- Yo.

814
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,000
Give the man a minute, Vincent.

815
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,874
He just got here.

816
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,312
But they're not strong anymore,

817
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,152
and they can't protect me now.

818
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,549
But in life, you always have an out.

819
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,896
The thing is, the less you have,

820
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,911
the higher the price you have to pay.

821
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,918
A boss needs to keep control, yeah?

822
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,199
And if you lose respect,
that's a problem, innit?

823
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,474
Yeah.

824
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,919
Bad for business.

825
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,994
Now, I know you got yourself pinched,

826
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,832
but I also know that your boy Daniel

827
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,956
has been talking to the police.

828
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:17,955
And so what do you say?

829
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,873
Am I dealing with, like,
a little coup from within here?

830
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,473
No, no, no. No way.

831
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,594
Look, I've known Daniel my entire life.

832
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,256
He's a lot of things,
but he ain't no snitch.

833
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,078
It's a fact,
and this ain't some muggy 9:00 to 5:00

834
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,116
where you can just hand in your notice.

835
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,036
You can try and leave this life,

836
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,520
but this life will never leave you.

837
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,233
Very poetic. Thank you, Vincent.

838
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,113
Hey, look, I've got a soldier
who's ready to step up.

839
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,799
Nothing will change for you, man.

840
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,113
I can vouch for him.

841
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,628
All right.

842
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,074
All right.

843
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,868
Got a very simple proposition for you.

844
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,032
The weed on your path

845
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,197
to a better life has to be gone.

846
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,798
You understand?

847
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,311
You still got that gun I gave you?

848
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,908
Kind of.

849
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,752
Someone's looking after it for me, innit?

850
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,476
Well, someone better give you it back.

851
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,159
We won't meet this new man
till Daniel's gone.

852
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,514
Am I clear?

853
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,674
Am I clear?

854
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,878
Am I clear on the price I have to pay

855
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,712
to leave my old life behind?

856
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,159
Yeah.

857
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,468
I am.

858
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,713
Crystal clear.

859
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,872
So, how do you know Terence?

860
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,952
Oh, we live in the same area, so, you know.

861
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,075
Yeah.

862
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,832
Do you live with your parents?

863
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,388
I did live with my mom until recently.

864
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,438
But I kind of moved on, still.

865
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,272
And my dad...

866
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,828
Boy, I ain't seen that guy in time.

867
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,356
That man got a new family.
I guess he moved on as well.

868
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,638
I'm sorry to hear that.

869
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,233
I didn't mean to pry.

870
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,470
Nah, nah, it's cool. It's no biggie.

871
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,196
Yeah, anyway, I better get going.

872
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,599
I'll see you tomorrow.

873
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,715
Final audition.

874
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,278
Oh, yeah. Yeah, all right. Cool, all right.

875
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,191
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

876
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,393
There he is! There he is!

877
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,536
There's Daddy. Go on.

878
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,710
- You want to say hi?
- There's my monsters!

879
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,714
Come here.

880
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,678
Come here, you two.

881
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,432
I've missed you so much, so much.

882
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,671
- You going to go play, yeah?
- Yeah.

883
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,312
You're early for once.

884
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,469
Yeah, I've been running.

885
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,519
Like the old days.

886
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,469
You look different.

887
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,197
- Do I?
- Mmm.

888
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,998
No, I'm just me.

889
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,592
It's good that
you're straightening yourself out.

890
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,591
I heard about the nosebleed.

891
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,757
Do you mind if we get a photo, Max?

892
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,590
Uh... No, not today, mate.

893
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,318
I'm just with the family, okay, yeah?

894
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,835
- Cheers.
- No worries.

895
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,314
No, I just want to concentrate
on being a good dad.

896
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,469
Come and play, Daddy!

897
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,474
All right then.

898
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,999
Oh, man.

899
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,914
Here I come!

900
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,991
For Chris and Samantha,

901
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,550
having a large garden
is top of their list of priorities.

902
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,313
With three growing boys
and one more on the way,

903
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,470
space to run around is essential.

904
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,711
The first property I've found
ticks all of those boxes.

905
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,756
But is it too far out of town?

906
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,114
So, guys, what do you think?

907
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,838
Oh, it's absolutely gorgeous.

908
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,070
Oh, it's so lovely...

909
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,712
Come on, George, you've been sat
in that chair all day again.

910
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,836
And you ain't touched the lunch I left.

911
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,032
Right, we need to get you out of here.

912
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,038
You've got five minutes,
you best pull yourself together.

913
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,273
I mean it, George. Five minutes.

914
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,192
You remember
what happened here nearly 20 years ago?

915
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,794
Yeah. Course I do.

916
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:26,116
You got down on one knee
and promised me the world.

917
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,509
And you delivered.

918
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,028
Maybe not the big house full of kids.

919
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,756
But you told me you'd be my rock forever.

920
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,238
And you have, George.

921
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,079
Really, you have.

922
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,032
But I've made my decision.

923
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,276
We can't bring a kid into all this.

924
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,919
We can't do it right now.

925
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,837
We may never be able to.

926
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,112
I know what I'm saying, and...

927
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,235
And I'm all right with it.

928
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,118
- Sweetheart, you know...
- No, just let me finish.

929
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,236
You know I've always wanted a kid,

930
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,959
and as much as it's hurt over the years...

931
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,430
With me mum going on
and all my friends having 'em.

932
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,717
If I'm given a choice

933
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,668
of getting my husband back,

934
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,753
or getting a new baby,

935
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,757
I'd pick you

936
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,074
every time.

937
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,152
I just want my rock back.

938
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,157
It was an accident, love,

939
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,113
plain and simple.

940
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,079
I know. I know.

941
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,920
- Sorry to keep you waiting so long.
- That's all right.

942
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,472
Um... I've got bad news, I'm afraid.

943
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,152
Terence died this morning.

944
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,475
What do you mean he's dead? He...

945
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,233
No, he can't be, I saw him just...

946
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,548
I'm so sorry.

947
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,388
How?

948
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,360
Is this from when he was robbed?

949
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,913
He had internal bleeding,
so he didn't know, and...

950
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,296
I kept telling him to go
to hospital, but he just...

951
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,515
He said he was fine, man!

952
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,918
Fuck!

953
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,273
Fine!

954
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,674
Yo, Kings!

955
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,118
I was looking for you everywhere.

956
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,320
- You okay, yeah?
- Yeah, man.

957
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,118
Just had a bit of bad news, that's all.

958
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,434
What, Jules?

959
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,273
Nah, nah, nah, just some shit
in my other world.

960
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,479
He wants to meet, though.

961
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,998
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

962
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,296
What, you sure he's gonna trust me?

963
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,469
Yeah, man, don't watch that.

964
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,120
He knows you've been my boy for a time.

965
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:46,788
Nice.

966
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,400
You're gonna be on your own now, though.

967
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,080
You sure you're gonna be cool with that?

968
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:58,036
Yeah, man, I've been on my own for time.

969
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,076
No more looking in the rearview.

970
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,071
Your man's got a future on you now.

971
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,353
What about Daniel?

972
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,868
Yeah, I've still got to
take care of that, man.

973
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,431
Man should've known who he's dealing with!

974
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,075
Oh, shit, what brings you round
these days, cuz?

975
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,633
I thought you got chucked out.

976
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,496
Yo, Jules wants you gone, fam.
He don't trust you.

977
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,896
He thinks you're working with the feds.

978
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,319
What you been smoking, cuz?

979
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,719
Yo, this ain't no joke, tin man.

980
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,936
He knows you ain't been nicked.

981
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,200
You need to leave the ends now.

982
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,713
I can't just leave like that, cuz.

983
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,195
- You okay, D?
- Yo, fuck off, little man.

984
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,552
Where the fuck you get these from, bruv?

985
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,198
- Ooh, these are mine.
- What?

986
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,520
- Let me check these out.
- No, I don't think so.

987
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,308
Get the fuck off, man!

988
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,872
You nearly fucking killed our boy, cuz!

989
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:56,995
That ain't our boy!

990
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,433
And we ain't on nuttin' no more!

991
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,856
What the fuck you talking about, fam?

992
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,376
Watch too many movies or something, cuz?

993
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,360
You see what these little cunts do
to impress you?

994
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,875
I ain't their boss, fam!

995
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,160
Seriously, man,
I can't have you fucking with my future.

996
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,553
Hello!

997
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,318
Anybody home?

998
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,838
No?

999
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,512
Just as I planned it.

1000
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,872
Where do you keep your vases?

1001
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,349
Ah-ha. Beautiful.

1002
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,960
Mmm.

1003
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,479
Fuck!

1004
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,070
Come on. Pick up the phone.

1005
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,152
- Can we buy Daddy a present?
- Yes, we can, Evie,

1006
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,096
but we've got to be quick
because we've got to get back.

1007
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,016
- Shall we call Daddy? See if he's at home?
- Yeah.

1008
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,096
Then we'll know what he wants.

1009
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,633
Oh, shit, the battery's dead.

1010
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,720
What did I tell you, Leo?

1011
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,880
If you play those games,
the battery's going to die.

1012
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,630
Yeah, you've got to listen to Mummy.

1013
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,914
Fucking slag. You fucking slag.

1014
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,274
Oh, uh, hello, is that Simon?

1015
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,672
Yeah, it's... It's George Radford.

1016
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,113
The cab driver.

1017
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,070
I tried to call before, yeah.

1018
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:35,236
Yeah. Yeah, you know.

1019
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,436
Listen, I... I know it might be too soon,

1020
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,875
but I was wondering
if maybe we could meet up?

1021
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,776
I won't take up much of your time,

1022
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,509
and I totally understand
if it's not something you want to do.

1023
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,399
What, today?

1024
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,991
Yeah, are you sure?

1025
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,552
All right, great.

1026
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,757
All right, Simon, thank you.
I'll... I'll see you there.

1027
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,115
Ta.

1028
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,434
Yeah, if it was you,

1029
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,431
I'd want to meet the geezer that done it.

1030
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,197
Right, what shall we get Daddy then?

1031
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,840
Some headphones
because I remember breaking them.

1032
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,798
Did you break them? Well, let's see.

1033
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,393
I don't know where they are.

1034
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,991
Look, Mommy, our house is on TV.

1035
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,157
I'm not so sure, Leo.

1036
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,240
Okay, kids, come on.

1037
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,560
Come on, we're going to go now.

1038
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,755
Come with me.

1039
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,799
A siege is now developing
here in southwest London.

1040
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,108
The rugby captain,

1041
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,696
former England rugby captain Max Moore
is armed with a shotgun...

1042
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:56,076
Max,
put down the gun and pick up the phone!

1043
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,360
That's right.

1044
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,357
Max! Please pick up the phone!

1045
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,790
I ain't fucking talking
to none of you pussyholes

1046
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,757
until I fucking see my wife.

1047
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,037
Fucking see my wife.

1048
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,276
Where is she? Where's my wife?

1049
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,868
I want my wife! Get my wife out here now!

1050
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,256
- We don't think that this...
- Come on, you could've shot me by now!

1051
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,396
I'm standing right here! Look at me!

1052
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,357
Police are certainly here...

1053
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,200
What, are you afraid to pull the trigger?

1054
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,280
Why haven't you shot, eh? Are you scared?

1055
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,711
Because I'm not!

1056
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,638
What happened, exactly?

1057
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,200
I was on my way home.

1058
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,635
It was the last fare of the day.

1059
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,832
I had this fella in the back.
I almost didn't pick him up.

1060
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,033
He was going on and on.

1061
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,835
Then this woman just...

1062
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,216
She just pulled out in front of me.

1063
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:07,434
She didn't even look.

1064
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,272
So, I swerved to avoid her.

1065
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,316
And, uh...

1066
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,231
And that's when I hit your wife.

1067
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,832
Tell me one thing.

1068
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:28,954
Was she smiling?

1069
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,315
What?

1070
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:35,110
Ruth, when it happened, was she smiling?

1071
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,950
Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.

1072
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,073
When she crossed the road...

1073
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,155
Did she look happy?

1074
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,475
Yeah.

1075
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,118
Yeah, she looked very happy.

1076
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,396
Actually, just walking
past me now is Emily.

1077
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,520
Emily, you're live on Sky.

1078
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,720
Do you think we might have
a very quick word with you?

1079
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,916
That's my house, that's my...
That's my husband!

1080
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,069
I need to talk to him!

1081
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,515
I need to talk to him.

1082
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,349
Please
put down the gun and pick up the phone!

1083
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,159
Move back now!

1084
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,558
Look, hey, I'm not fucking speaking...

1085
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,868
Hi, Max, it's Emily.

1086
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,948
Max, what's going on?

1087
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,360
Why the fuck have you got a gun?

1088
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,656
Where the fuck have you been all day?
You fucking betrayed me.

1089
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:38,636
And if I want to fucking talk to you,

1090
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,816
but you just fucking betray me,

1091
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,456
- is that what's going on?
- I don't understand.

1092
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:42,833
Who... Who are you mad at?

1093
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,035
Who the fuck am I mad at?

1094
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,712
You fucking fucked that little prick!

1095
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,798
Why did you
have to fucking do all of that shit?

1096
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,056
It's gonna end today, darling.

1097
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,435
It's gonna end you, me,
and that little prick!

1098
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,988
Bring him up here! Bring him here!

1099
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,274
Why did you have to fucking run away
with college boy, yeah?

1100
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,856
Because I'm not a fucking romantic man?

1101
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,189
Mr. Fucking Romantic!
Mr. Fucking College Boy?

1102
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,236
I'm not him? I fucking work hard!

1103
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,678
I live in the fucking real world

1104
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,512
where you have to fucking work.

1105
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,512
And I work and I fucking pay,
and I fucking sacrifice!

1106
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,616
All right, you're fucking...

1107
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,279
Now you're pregnant
with this stupid cunt. You're pregnant!

1108
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,675
Why didn't you fucking just tell me that?

1109
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,829
Hi, Kath. Don't know where you got to.

1110
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,592
I've been trying to call you all day.

1111
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:20,749
Uh, anyway, I did it. I'm back in the cab.

1112
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,512
Same old chaos out here.

1113
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,416
Bell me when you get this, though, yeah?

1114
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,600
Let me know you're all right.

1115
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,678
See you later. Bye.

1116
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,069
What the fuck?

1117
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,776
Look, I didn't know what I wanted then,

1118
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,916
and I was getting myself back together,

1119
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,595
and then you going off
doing the "poor old me" thing.

1120
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,752
Oh, that's right, blame me!
It's my fault, isn't it?

1121
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,236
What are you fucking saying?
It's all my fault?

1122
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,550
You wouldn't have gotten pregnant
by that fucking...

1123
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,278
It's yours, Max.

1124
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,912
Trust me. I didn't take any risks.

1125
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,319
It can only be yours.

1126
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,636
I told you to be gone, man.

1127
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,439
Time moves on,
and you ain't nothing but a dumb relic now.

1128
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,478
Vincent told me if I don't get rid of you,
then we're both done.

1129
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:18,993
Go on, fucking do it, then!

1130
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,514
Go on! Do it!

1131
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:25,508
You have to end this now.
You have to make a decision.

1132
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,736
What do you really, really want?

1133
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,193
What's important to you?

1134
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,960
You're not even gonna do it, are you?

1135
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,873
He's a fucking pussy, yo!

1136
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,434
Hey, step aside, Kings.

1137
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,953
Oh, shit.

1138
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,395
Think about your children.
Think about Leo and Evie.

1139
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,436
They need you. They need their dad.

1140
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,954
Max, talk to me.

1141
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,149
Put down the gun!

1142
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,400
All right. All right.

1143
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,516
Yeah. All right.

1144
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,070
I give up. All right.

1145
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,856
Put down the gun!

1146
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,518
I'm putting it down, all right?

1147
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,398
I'm putting it down.
I'm putting it down. Look.

1148
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,278
- All right, there it is.
- Put your hands up!

1149
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,510
I'm a fucking idiot.

1150
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,191
Put your hands on your head.

1151
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:08,920
Suspect has given himself up.

1152
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,791
Kathy?

1153
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,154
Kathy, love?

1154
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,951
Hello, Leon. Where's Mum?

1155
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,755
Kathy?

1156
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:39,955
Kath!

1157
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,800
- Here you go, mate. Here's your drink.
- Cheers, man.

1158
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,748
Surprise!

1159
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,911
Happy anniversary, babe!

1160
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,992
Come here, silly bollocks.

1161
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:14,313
A hundred streets and I will walk them all

1162
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,834
Raise a wire on a concrete wall...

1163
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,316
If we get a kid, he's gonna play rugby.

1164
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,675
A game for gentleman, not hooligans.

1165
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:29,068
Another siren cuts the night in two

1166
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:33,631
Another killer from another crew oh, yeah

1167
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,990
There's something going on

1168
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,514
- Oh, I've got something for you.
- Yeah?

1169
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,913
- What's this?
- A future, Mom says.

1170
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:59,075
I see the teeth in every strangers' smile

1171
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:03,392
I'll live and die in this
familiar square mile

1172
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,597
Down by the riverside

1173
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,074
We'll build a future just to tear it down

1174
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:18,790
Beside the banks of the
oldest thing in town

1175
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,553
Which keeps running

1176
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:30,551
To hold it down

1177
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:37,598
And hold it down

1178
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:44,068
And this is not a time for turning back

1179
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,160
A hundred streets

1180
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,913
And I stepped on every crack

1181
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,839
The tide was built to turn

1182
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:59,159
I read the script and I will play my part

1183
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:03,995
Until forever comes to
still this beating heart

1184
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:08,198
And hold it down

1185
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:15,398
And hold it down

1186
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:22,952
And hold it down

1187
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:31,199
And hold it down

1188
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:38,112
Hold it down

1189
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,829
It's connected by invisible ties

1190
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:52,476
Dig out the truth within
a million snow-white lies

1191
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,158
To keep you honest

1192
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:03,031
And the world is beautiful
and life is sweet

1193
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:07,511
If I could leave a mark
upon these hundred streets

1194
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,638
Well, let it be this

1194
01:30:11,305 --> 01:31:11,310

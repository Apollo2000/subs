3
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,331
They stone her, Fred.

4
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,367
You reading one
of Shirley's stories?

5
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,670
The whole town,
even her own children.

6
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,338
They all stone her.

7
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,508
That's creepy.

8
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,446
It's terrific.

Moving target, bonus points!

22
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,653
- That looks delicious.
- Oh, thank you.

23
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:54,725
Oh!

24
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:59,497
Welcome to our hallow end
of the Earth, my boy!

25
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:01,766
Welcome to Bennington!

26
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:03,334
Good to see you, Professor.

27
00:04:03,336 --> 00:04:05,235
Oh, look at this!
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya.

28
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:09,340
And, oh, who is
this lovely dove?

29
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:11,174
Rose Nemser.
You must be Professor Hyman.

30
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:14,311
Oh, Stanley.
Stanley.

31
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:16,414
I profess nothing.

32
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,248
Come, come, come, come.

33
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,585
Let's get you watered down.

34
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:23,423
I'll bring him back
in one piece, Rosie.

35
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:26,691
Okay.

36
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,906
I'm trudging back up
the hill,

37
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:43,206
and I'm cursing my back.

38
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,508
I'm cursing my feet.

39
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,876
I'm cursing all
of goddamn humanity,

40
00:04:45,878 --> 00:04:49,413
and then it hit me.

41
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,881
The whole thing.

42
00:04:50,883 --> 00:04:55,586
So I sat down at my desk,
and two hours later...

43
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:59,790
the most reviled story "The
New Yorker" has ever printed.

44
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:04,428
I read it as
an anti-Semitic parable

45
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,230
in the tradition of Isaac Babel.

46
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:11,201
Calling my wife an Anti-Semite,
are we?

47
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:14,605
Well, to be fair,
she never hated a single Jew

48
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:16,540
until she married me.

49
00:05:17,744 --> 00:05:20,911
We had a wonderful courtship.

50
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:22,278
Didn't we, dear?

51
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,615
He asked me out
for cheeseburgers.

52
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,784
Who could refuse such a...

53
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,753
such a romance?

54
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,558
Next thing I know, he's ripping
apart a story of mine.

55
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,295
Then he has the gall to tell me
that he has lost his wallet.

56
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:42,900
That wallet's been lost
for over 20 years.

57
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:47,605
Now, mind you, that story...

58
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:51,609
was the most remarkable story
I'd ever read.

59
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:56,279
I knew I was going to marry
the woman who wrote it.

60
00:05:56,281 --> 00:06:00,685
I was going to hunt her down
and make her marry me.

61
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:05,523
To our suffering, my dear.

62
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:08,426
There's not enough Scotch
in the world for that one.

63
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:12,331
So, Shirley,
what are you writing now?

64
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:22,940
A little novella I'm calling
"None of Your Goddamn Business."

65
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,517
Excuse me, I'm Rose.
Rose Nemser.

66
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,988
Betty, Debbie, Kathy...

67
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,623
You're all the same to me.

68
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,992
No, no. I'm Fred's wife.
Fred Nemser.

69
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:44,328
He's helping Professor Hyman
with this semester.

70
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,631
We were invited to stay here
for a few days

71
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,635
until we could find a place.

72
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,647
No one said you were pregnant.

73
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,853
W-We weren't telling
anybody yet.

74
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,657
I-I-I read your story.

75
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:14,692
There have been several.

76
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:17,762
"The Lottery."

77
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:20,433
When I read it,
it made me feel...

78
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:24,804
...thrillingly horrible.

79
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:31,669
♪ Father, did you bring me
the silver? ♪

80
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:33,404
♪ Father, did you bring me
the gold? ♪

81
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:36,642
That was Lead Belly.

82
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:41,614
Huddie Ledbetter.

83
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:48,452
This is Myth and Folklore.

84
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:50,187
I am Professor Stanley Hyman,

85
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:53,591
your fearless leader
for the next 12 weeks

86
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:57,862
as we ascend to the heights
of the gods

87
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:01,932
and stoop to the very depths
of human depravity.

88
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:04,535
- Oh.
- Hello.

89
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:06,971
Hi.
Isn't he great?

90
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:09,073
Oh, terrific.
I wish my Chaucer class

91
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:10,875
that I'm auditing wasn't
at the same time.

92
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:13,777
Oh, well, there will be
other semesters.

93
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,779
Sure.

94
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,615
Might I burden you
with a favor?

95
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:19,518
Hmm. What's that?

96
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:26,156
Shirley has these bouts...

97
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:28,993
and just can't, uh...

98
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:30,628
can't keep up...

99
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,930
with the household, shopping,

100
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:35,499
and our last housekeeper
just quit.

101
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:36,567
Oh.

102
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:38,903
Bad back or lungs.

103
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:41,772
I don't recall.
Maybe gout?

104
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:44,208
But it would be such
a titanic help

105
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,745
if you would just tidy up a bit.
Excuse me?

106
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:48,946
Maybe chip in
with the laundry...

107
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:51,615
- Yes?
- ...the cooking?

108
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:53,884
- Oh...
- Well, no, no, no.

109
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,920
That's too much.

110
00:09:55,922 --> 00:09:57,922
Don't think I confuse you
for a scullery maid.

111
00:09:57,924 --> 00:10:00,257
It's just, we are
in a bit of a bind.

112
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,825
Well, perhaps I could...

113
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:03,928
I could help out
in between classes?

114
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,863
Well, obviously, room
and board on us.

115
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,731
- Oh, no, no, no. We couldn't.
- No, no, no. Of course.

116
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,066
- We couldn't.
- Of course. I insist.

117
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,501
Might you stay, hmm?

118
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:13,938
Just until we're...

119
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,508
settled in, hmm?

120
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,880
How's your rump roast?

121
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:25,518
I love hot food in hot weather.

122
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,694
He really seems in a bind.

123
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:39,198
It could be sort of fun, hmm?

124
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:44,704
Or we say no.

125
00:12:05,084 --> 00:12:07,618

3... 2... 1.

133
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,295
Get dressed for dinner,
darling.

134
00:12:51,297 --> 00:12:53,831
Please.

135
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,835
Try.
Go away.

136
00:12:57,837 --> 00:13:00,003
I really think the two of them
are gonna work out.

137
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:02,440
Did you see our kitchen?

138
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:07,111
A clean house is evidence
of mental inferiority.

139
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:08,846
Well, thank God
for the simpletons.

140
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:11,115
How else would we ever
have fresh linens?

141
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:13,851
You hired spies, is that it?

142
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:15,686
I'm trying to help you,
Shirl.

143
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:19,022
Take some of the pressure off
so you can get your work done.

144
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:23,461
I don't want strangers here.
I don't like them.

145
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,731
We've already discussed it,
dear.

146
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,636
Hmm?

147
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,805
Fred's going to lighten
my class load

148
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:38,976
so that I can be
around the house more.

149
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:40,478
Won't you like that?

150
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,085
You can't expect me
to indulge this, can you?

151
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,921
Hmm?

152
00:13:50,923 --> 00:13:53,056
Staying in bed all day?

153
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:56,293
Well, the party was too much.
It set me back.

154
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,962
You have to get back
to your desk.

155
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,031
You're putting an undue
amount of pressure on me.

156
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:03,368
Fussing over you
when I have work to do.

157
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,938
You don't want my work
to suffer, too, do you?

158
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:10,809
No.

159
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,858
I'm going to get better.

160
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:29,927
I promise.

161
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:31,130
I will.

162
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:41,406
Starting tomorrow.
No, starting tonight.

163
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:43,807
You are putting on
clean clothes

164
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:46,944
and sitting at the table
for a proper meal.

165
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:49,213
- I can't.
- You will.

166
00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:50,983
Besides...

167
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:54,851
...it's cocktail hour.

168
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,122
Up, up, up.

169
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:02,159
It's going to be so dull.

170
00:15:02,161 --> 00:15:06,131
Well, I didn't ask you
to behave at the table.

171
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:20,411
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo.

172
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:22,513
Oh, a gorgeous slab of flesh.

173
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:24,848
Oh, it was nothing.

174
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:29,186
Oh, go on, my boy.
Shed a layer.

175
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:31,221
We aren't formal in this house.

176
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:35,225
I've often thought
about participating

177
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:38,396
in the Native American ritual
of the sweat lodge.

178
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,831
- Thank you.
- Often?

179
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,467
Why, yes, dear.

180
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:46,003
But then I learned you have to
crawl through a dirt tunnel

181
00:15:46,005 --> 00:15:47,472
under the ground

182
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:50,040
and sit naked buttocks
to naked buttocks

183
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:53,043
with a dozen other men
while some shaman

184
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:57,314
stokes a smoky fire, maintaining
the 100-degree heat

185
00:15:57,316 --> 00:16:01,051
and peddles some noxious
root tea

186
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,186
that inspires hallucinations.

187
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:04,323
Ooh!

188
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,336
So when's the baby due?

189
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:20,237
- The baby?
- Oops.

190
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,606
Was it supposed to be
a surprise?

191
00:16:21,608 --> 00:16:25,208
You should have
told me that, dear.

192
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,877
Well, I hope it's yours.

193
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,212
Of course it's his.

194
00:16:29,214 --> 00:16:32,182
February. Hmm.
Right, darling?

195
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:34,017
I would really rather discuss
something else,

196
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,286
if you don't mind.
February? Ha.

197
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,258
Did you tell him you were
knocked up before the wedding?

198
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,261
I fear, my love,
stories of copulations

199
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:47,498
might leave the table
without an appetite,

200
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,636
but that one does have
a sixth sense about babies.

201
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:54,672
Calls it. Girl or a boy,
she's never wrong.

202
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:57,240
Is poor Freddie here
going to be disappointed?

203
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,125
Okay. Shall I...?

204
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:16,862
Stay put.

205
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:20,698
You promised
to take care of that.

206
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:27,572
As you wish, dear.

207
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:34,379
So, Rose, you were telling us
about your shotgun wedding.

208
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:38,416
Excuse me.

209
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:41,920
I should see
if she's all right.

210
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:53,932
I feel a bit like
we're in the Scottish play.

211
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:59,437
I, the Thane of Cawdor,

212
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:03,474
with a murderous prophecy
over my head.

213
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:08,178
And you, Lady M...

214
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,548
on the verge of madness.

215
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,686
What will happen?

216
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:23,561
I have a title.

217
00:18:23,563 --> 00:18:25,228
"Hangsaman."

218
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,365
It's about that girl.

219
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,566
The missing one.

220
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:30,334
The Welden girl?

221
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:32,002
What do you think?

222
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:35,305
Well, you haven't said much.

223
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:37,542
Well, it's just an idea.

224
00:18:37,544 --> 00:18:41,111
I can try something else.
Disappearing college girls.

225
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:45,148
Sounds trite and a bit trashy,
but, you know, give it a go.

226
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,352
I'll read, of course,
before you wade too far in.

227
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:50,287
It's going to take some time.

228
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:52,255
Well, give it to me
in a couple of days.

229
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,426
It's a novel.

230
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:58,763
Oh, no, dear.
That's...

231
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:01,632
You're not...

232
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:03,403
You're just not up to it.

233
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,538
You're wrong.

234
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,109
Darling, you haven't been out
of the house in two months.

235
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:16,614
You're barely able to put
on a pair of stockings.

236
00:19:16,616 --> 00:19:19,151
Ease back.
That's all I'm saying.

237
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,391
If that phone rings...

238
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:30,595
one more time during dinner...

239
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:34,264
Stanley, so help me, I'm going
to take care of it myself.

240
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm well within the bounds
of our agreement.

241
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:38,469
Ah. Hmm.

242
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:44,009
Our agreement didn't include
sluts interrupting my dinner.

243
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:48,679
I will talk to her

244
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:52,084
and tell you everything,
as I always do.

245
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:57,622
You're really scraping
the barrel these days.

One week.
That's enough time.

262
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:59,316
Please?

263
00:20:59,318 --> 00:21:01,852
Maybe she'll even out
when she gets better.

264
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:04,220
No, no.
She's a fucking monster.

265
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,624
Shh. Shh.
Hey, hey.

266
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:09,727
Hey.

267
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:12,496
Look at me.

268
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:14,498
Look at me.

269
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,835
Don't upset yourself.

270
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:19,772
It's a big opportunity for us.

271
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:27,878
Do you like your students?

272
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,416
I like you.

273
00:21:34,487 --> 00:21:36,252
Are they smarter,
do you think...

274
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,222
- Smarter? No.
- ...than my class?

275
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:40,727
No.

276
00:21:43,796 --> 00:21:45,197
Just richer.

277
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:04,849
"Always wore a red coat.

278
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:07,652
Last seen at the trailhead.

279
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:11,287
Paula was 17
and already disappointed.

280
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,757
The dread of going
to college..."

281
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,959
No.

282
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:18,261
"She was 17, an age
that brought with it

283
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:21,332
the possibility
of her whole life ahead..."

284
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,367
Fuck.
"...that brought with it

285
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,803
the stabbing nervousness
that at any moment

286
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:27,805
her life would go horribly..."

287
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:29,607
Fuck!

288
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:30,975
I found that article
that links the tonality

289
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:32,610
of the Druid dirges

290
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:34,412
to the Appalachian
mourning ballads

291
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:37,415
in the second volume
of Francis Child's collection.

292
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,717
Well, that's grand.
Just grand.

293
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:41,585
Yes. Yes. That's what I was
cross-referencing...

294
00:22:41,587 --> 00:22:42,787
Milk?

295
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:45,856
...in chapter 7
of my dissertation.

296
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:48,659
I'm not sure if you had the
opportunity to read that yet.

297
00:22:48,661 --> 00:22:49,960
Good god, son.

298
00:22:49,962 --> 00:22:52,197
Might I have a cup
of coffee in peace?

299
00:22:59,572 --> 00:23:03,340
Mm.

300
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:05,543
Well...

301
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:09,312
Keep an eye on the missus
for me, won't you, dear?

302
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:10,414
Mwah.

303
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,417
Of course, Professor.

304
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:15,352
Stop that this instant.

305
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,688
Mrs. Nemser, Stanley.

306
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,757
Stanley, hmm?

307
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,527
Don't make me tell you again.

308
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,499
Okay.

309
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:10,775
You want to see
what a writer does?

310
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:13,511
Absolutely nothing.

311
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:16,783
Come here.
Come here!

312
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:23,921
Look for anything
with fertility,

313
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:27,892
maternity or full moon
in the title.

314
00:24:27,894 --> 00:24:31,695
Alright.

315
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:33,866
I'm a witch.
Didn't anyone tell you?

316
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:37,835
Happy, healthy baby.

317
00:24:37,837 --> 00:24:40,439
That's the spell we need.

318
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:45,878
Unless you want a spell
for the other thing.

319
00:24:49,515 --> 00:24:53,717
How... How could you
even say that?

320
00:24:53,719 --> 00:24:55,788
Motherhood comes with a price,
you know.

321
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:11,836
Here.

322
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:15,005
Cut them.

323
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:17,842
Go on.

324
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:19,612
They won't bite.

325
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:27,753
Sit.

326
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:37,456
What did you see?

327
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:52,670
"Paula.

328
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:54,772
Paula preferred to keep
her expectations

329
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:56,774
of people meager at best.

330
00:26:56,776 --> 00:26:59,543
Why should she be
constantly taken in?

331
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:02,613
Why should she be
constantly disappointed?

332
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:06,583
Yet she couldn't help but
wonder, what was she missing?

333
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:09,687
This... This...

334
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:14,091
This doubt was intensified by
the girl with the sweater set

335
00:27:14,093 --> 00:27:16,095
sitting across from her
at dinner."

336
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,501
Shirley?

337
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:18,956
What are you doing in here?

338
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,958
I'm sorry. I thought I'd bring
you coffee. I'm sorry.

339
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,092
Get out!

340
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:23,761
Get out!

341
00:28:23,763 --> 00:28:25,262
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

342
00:28:25,264 --> 00:28:27,664
Don't touch my writing.
Don't touch anything!

343
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,199
Get out!

344
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,820
You're drunk.

345
00:29:22,822 --> 00:29:24,088
I thought you were meant
to be advising

346
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,123
the Shakespeare Society.

347
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:30,127
I didn't know they served
booze at that.

348
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:31,995
They don't.
Don't be stupid.

349
00:29:31,997 --> 00:29:35,833
I just stopped for a few drinks
at the men's club, that's all.

350
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:37,734
Oh.

351
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,871
Who's the jealous housewife?

352
00:29:40,873 --> 00:29:42,940
Oh!
Mm.

353
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:45,242
Ahh. Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.

354
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,347
Bedtime.

355
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,923
Is it because...?

356
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,061
No. No.
You're beautiful.

357
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,782
I had a crazy dream.

358
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:01,785
There was mud oozing
from the fridge.

359
00:31:01,787 --> 00:31:04,489
Big worms coming out of the...

360
00:31:04,491 --> 00:31:08,058
coming out of the crisper,

361
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,796
just fat as fingers.

362
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:18,338
Freud would've had a field day.

363
00:31:22,475 --> 00:31:26,143
- I haven't read any.
- Do you regret it?

364
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:28,111
Not reading Freud?

365
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:30,881
And dropping out.

366
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:33,786
I'm keeping up,
reading what I can.

367
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:43,126
After the baby, Fred says
I can go back to school.

368
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:47,365
He's allowing you.
Wow.

369
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:50,968
Was he at the
Shakespeare Society tonight?

370
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,471
Fred's a good man.

371
00:31:53,473 --> 00:31:56,006
So you've said.

372
00:31:56,008 --> 00:31:58,244
His parents cut him off
when we eloped.

373
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:04,081
And he knew they would...

374
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,216
but he married me anyway.

375
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:12,191
And you have to prove
that you're worth it.

376
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:16,527
Yeah.

377
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:18,195
It sounds exhausting.

378
00:32:35,147 --> 00:32:36,982
I'm lost, Rosie.

379
00:32:41,354 --> 00:32:43,222
I'm lost.

380
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:52,831
Do you know what it's like
to have a secret?

381
00:32:56,902 --> 00:33:00,371
I can't write worth a damn.

382
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:02,906
You're a terrific writer.

383
00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:04,877
Everyone loves your work.

384
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,850
They talk...

385
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:17,522
...about me...

386
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:21,058
in town.

387
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,461
I see things on people's faces.

388
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:29,166
They're afraid to brush up
against me.

389
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:34,139
My dark, my thoughts
are going to infect them.

390
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:39,209
This book, it's...

391
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:40,511
It might kill me.

392
00:33:40,513 --> 00:33:42,549
I can't figure out this girl.

393
00:33:46,218 --> 00:33:48,085
Maybe disappearing
was the only way

394
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:49,589
anyone would notice her.

395
00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:04,267
I need you to run
an errand for me.

396
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:07,170
Christ.

397
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:08,639
Oh, so the writing's
going well then?

398
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:11,975
Please don't ever ask me
that again.

399
00:34:11,977 --> 00:34:14,479
I need you to run up to campus.

400
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:16,046
Okay, I can send Fred.

401
00:34:16,048 --> 00:34:19,249
No.
No, this is between us.

402
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:22,285
Stanley doesn't really want you
being alone right now.

403
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:23,421
- Forget it.
- No.

404
00:34:23,423 --> 00:34:25,122
Forget I ever asked.

405
00:34:25,124 --> 00:34:27,090
I just thought you would like
a little adventure.

406
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:29,560
I'm simply saying
that I would go with you

407
00:34:29,562 --> 00:34:31,995
if you wanted an outing.

408
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:35,198
Like a picnic?

409
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,569
Do you want to make up
some egg salad sandwiches?

410
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:40,340
Fly a kite while we're at it?

411
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,177
Please?

412
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,679
Do this for me.

413
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:08,392
"Paula normally hated
socializing at school,

414
00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:11,662
but she forced herself
to do it."

415
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:14,499
- Hi, Caroline.
- Good day, Mrs. Nemser.

416
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:18,235
My, you are a voracious reader.

417
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:20,505
You know, you and Fred
should come to the house.

418
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:22,573
The Dean and I would love
to have you.

419
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:26,410
Plus, it must be rather dull
for young folks like you

420
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:29,847
to spend all your time with...

421
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:32,350
with that woman, I mean.

422
00:36:32,352 --> 00:36:34,519
I hear she never
leaves the house.

423
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:36,754
Or her bed, for that matter.

424
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:38,789
She's gone sick in the head.

425
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,324
No, she's...

426
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:42,426
she's working quite hard.

427
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:45,262
Every hour, every day.

428
00:36:45,264 --> 00:36:47,600
I only get my information
from Stanley.

429
00:36:50,803 --> 00:36:52,770
"She was relieved to spot
someone lurking

430
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:54,170
near the punchbowl,

431
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:56,374
looking as miserable
as she felt,

432
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:59,710
but his was a face that she'd
never seen before on campus.

433
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:02,346
And men were always
easily spotted."

434
00:37:02,348 --> 00:37:05,650
- Hyman house, huh?
- Yes, sir.

435
00:37:05,652 --> 00:37:09,620
I can't get my carriers
to deliver up there anymore.

436
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:13,357
She writes stories
with cannibalism in it.

437
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,761
That's what I've heard.

438
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:20,698
Mr. Fisher, do you...

439
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,802
do you, um,
often give young girls rides

440
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:26,337
in your postal truck?

441
00:37:31,176 --> 00:37:34,311
I'm not sure
I like your question.

442
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:35,646
Well, I just mean,

443
00:37:35,648 --> 00:37:38,382
is it a habit of yours
to shuttle college girls

444
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:41,485
along your route?

445
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:44,522
"Paula was proud of the way
she contradicted him,

446
00:37:44,524 --> 00:37:47,325
how she stayed ahead
of the conversation.

447
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:51,929
This is what it's like to be
a grown woman talking to a man."

448
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:55,298
I never seen Paula
before that day in my life.

449
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,368
Giving her a ride was
the Samaritan thing to do.

450
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:01,204
The girl was half frozen,
nothing but thin sneakers on.

451
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:02,707
Said she was going for a hike,

452
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:05,443
and I wasn't going to get
any further into her business.

453
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:07,345
But I didn't like that,
seeing it was almost sundown.

454
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,914
She had no knapsack.
She had no provisions.

455
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:13,351
I assumed she must've been
meeting someone.

456
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:15,953
"When they were at the party,
he had barely looked at her.

457
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:18,356
His voice had a lightness.

458
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:20,223
'Let's go somewhere quieter, '
he said.

459
00:38:20,225 --> 00:38:23,694
A hand on her back.

460
00:38:23,696 --> 00:38:25,529
But now...

461
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:27,465
But now, away from everyone...

462
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:31,201
his voice was muted,
floating above her.

463
00:38:31,203 --> 00:38:33,371
And she couldn't..."

464
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:36,376
"...she couldn't contradict him.

465
00:38:39,912 --> 00:38:41,681
Are you all right?

466
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,754
Oh, you little thief.

467
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:28,726
Severe menstrual cramps,
last week of November.

468
00:39:28,728 --> 00:39:30,995
Yeah.

469
00:39:30,997 --> 00:39:34,297
Doesn't go home for the holiday.

470
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:35,802
Meaning?

471
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:41,839
Meaning?

472
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:43,841
A miscarriage.

473
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:46,244
And a week later,
she goes missing.

474
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:52,282
That's good work, Rosie.

475
00:39:52,284 --> 00:39:53,851
And the post office?

476
00:39:53,853 --> 00:39:57,757
Randy Fisher said that he
thought she was meeting someone.

477
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:03,293
The timing is perfect.

478
00:40:03,295 --> 00:40:05,429
She gets pregnant.

479
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:08,432
She won't go home
for Thanksgiving.

480
00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:11,469
A week later, there's
a rendezvous in the woods.

481
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:12,972
Why there?

482
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:22,813
Because she's ashamed to have
someone meet her at campus

483
00:40:22,815 --> 00:40:26,419
or he doesn't want
to be seen there.

484
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:31,756
Because other people
might recognize him.

485
00:40:31,758 --> 00:40:35,493
Someone recognizable
from campus.

486
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:38,696
- Yes.
- Yes.

487
00:40:38,698 --> 00:40:41,899
Someone with authority.

488
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:45,903
"Meet me at the trail,"
and she does.

489
00:40:45,905 --> 00:40:48,606
A professor.

490
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:50,576
Why would she go?

491
00:40:54,914 --> 00:40:56,682
If you were her...

492
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:04,822
...and an accomplished,
confident, smart man...

493
00:41:04,824 --> 00:41:08,359
paid attention to you...

494
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:09,896
You'd never really been in love.

495
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,469
Would you go?

496
00:43:14,186 --> 00:43:17,554
Shirley?
Are you all right?

497
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:19,992
Are you okay in there?

498
00:43:41,213 --> 00:43:42,713
Did I startle you, Rosie?

499
00:43:42,715 --> 00:43:46,550
I-I thought...
I thought you were...

500
00:43:46,552 --> 00:43:48,786
It's just we three for dinner.

501
00:43:48,788 --> 00:43:52,089
Oh, wait. Two.
Shirley doesn't want to eat.

502
00:43:52,091 --> 00:43:54,124
Fred's up on campus tonight

503
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:55,626
advising
the Shakespeare Society.

504
00:43:55,628 --> 00:43:57,261
I'll make her a plate.

505
00:43:57,263 --> 00:43:59,797
Mm. Mnh-mnh.

506
00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:02,501
If she wants to eat,
she needs to come to the table.

507
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,869
Sure.

508
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,541
Oh, no, thank you.

509
00:44:10,543 --> 00:44:11,608
Mm.

510
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,143
Well, she's not a child,
Stanley.

511
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:15,980
Who's saying she is?

512
00:44:15,982 --> 00:44:18,983
We just have to get her back
to her desk, back to her work.

513
00:44:18,985 --> 00:44:20,250
She's working constantly.

514
00:44:20,252 --> 00:44:22,188
She barely has time for lunch.

515
00:44:29,128 --> 00:44:30,728
Poor thing.

516
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,897
She must really be having
a time of it.

517
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:35,866
I haven't seen anything yet.

518
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:39,570
Well, there are pages and pages
of a manuscript

519
00:44:39,572 --> 00:44:41,507
just sitting right on her desk.

520
00:44:43,843 --> 00:44:46,010
You've read it?

521
00:44:46,012 --> 00:44:49,780
No.
No, of course not.

522
00:44:49,782 --> 00:44:51,615
But...

523
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:54,687
you can differentiate a stack
of pages from a manuscript?

524
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:59,656
Such a bright girl.

525
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:01,627
Is there any of our pie left?

526
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:06,999
Rosie says you've got half
a manuscript already.

527
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:16,073
I wonder why
she would say that.

528
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:17,174
Just inquiring, darling.

529
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:18,809
You're not...

530
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:20,946
halfway through a novel
you haven't shown me?

531
00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:28,052
No.

532
00:45:28,054 --> 00:45:29,722
No, I don't.

533
00:45:32,124 --> 00:45:35,793
It's mostly grocery lists.

534
00:45:35,795 --> 00:45:37,895
Well, in that case,

535
00:45:37,897 --> 00:45:41,267
I'll just pop over to the Dean's
before dinner.

536
00:45:42,802 --> 00:45:44,234
You do that.

537
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:58,784
Say hello to Caroline.

538
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:14,633
Shirley?

539
00:46:22,808 --> 00:46:24,310
Shirley?

540
00:46:35,455 --> 00:46:37,823
Hey, let's go home.

541
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:41,927
Come on.

542
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:51,135
The death cap mushroom.

543
00:46:51,137 --> 00:46:54,106
Fatal to anyone who ingests it.

544
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,414
Don't you find it exhilarating?

545
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:07,151
Oh, most young women are
fascinated by their mortality.

546
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:09,887
They shouldn't be.

547
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:13,225
And the truth is, nobody really
cares if you live or if you die.

548
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,238
- Do you want to taste it?
- No.

549
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:33,712
Split it with me.

550
00:47:41,521 --> 00:47:43,989
It could stop our hearts
from beating.

551
00:48:03,242 --> 00:48:06,477
Shirley!
Spit it out!

552
00:48:06,479 --> 00:48:08,479
Spit it out right now!
Spit it out!

553
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:10,047
- No.
- I'm going to go get help.

554
00:48:11,817 --> 00:48:14,452
What?
Why are you laughing?

555
00:48:14,454 --> 00:48:17,422
It's not poisonous.

556
00:48:17,424 --> 00:48:19,056
But you said it was the...

557
00:48:19,058 --> 00:48:22,125
- It's not going to kill me.
- ...the death cap.

558
00:48:22,127 --> 00:48:24,395
These are the death cap
mushrooms.

559
00:48:24,397 --> 00:48:27,030
These are oyster mushrooms.

560
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:29,168
You had them
in your omelet yesterday.

561
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:37,309
I like you, Rosie.

562
00:48:41,146 --> 00:48:42,982
Why would I want to harm you?

563
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:51,321
You could run...

564
00:48:51,323 --> 00:48:54,293
run fast away from me,
but you don't.

565
00:48:57,263 --> 00:48:58,998
Why don't you?

566
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:04,404
Why do you stay?

567
00:49:13,112 --> 00:49:14,813
Can I trust you, Rosie?

568
00:49:22,555 --> 00:49:24,290
Do you want to betray me?

569
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:14,237
"Paula felt that no one
really cared if she lived

570
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:15,939
or if she died.

571
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:18,208
Not that she
was afraid of death.

572
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:20,210
She thought about it
all the time.

573
00:50:20,212 --> 00:50:22,979
It was the way she might die
that frightened her.

574
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:24,582
Ingloriously...

575
00:50:24,584 --> 00:50:27,284
face down in the soup."

576
00:50:27,286 --> 00:50:29,986
I stopped by
the Dean's office today.

577
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,221
Just a formality.

578
00:50:31,223 --> 00:50:33,023
Welcoming new faculty
and all that.

579
00:50:33,025 --> 00:50:35,025
He hinted there might be
an opening

580
00:50:35,027 --> 00:50:36,694
in the English Department
next fall.

581
00:50:36,696 --> 00:50:40,163
- Oh, that would be nice.
- Yes.

582
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:42,966
I just keep waiting for Stanley
to loosen the reins a bit.

583
00:50:42,968 --> 00:50:46,872
I am not a lackey, after all.

584
00:50:48,307 --> 00:50:50,209
I have lectures
prepared of my own.

585
00:50:52,379 --> 00:50:54,614
Don't want to sit
on the bench all season.

586
00:50:58,183 --> 00:51:00,353
Ow! What the fuck is this?
What?

587
00:51:03,088 --> 00:51:05,088
Oh, no, no, no.
There's a nest under the bed.

588
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:06,591
No, it's nettle.
It's nettle.

589
00:51:06,593 --> 00:51:09,660
- I'm getting a broom.
- It's a fertility offering.

590
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:12,963
- What?
- It's a fertility offering.

591
00:51:12,965 --> 00:51:14,732
No. No.

592
00:51:14,734 --> 00:51:18,137
You are not getting
into that bullshit.

593
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:23,674
I'm not getting into anything.
Just leave it be.

594
00:51:23,676 --> 00:51:25,543
- No.
- I'm sorry.

595
00:51:25,545 --> 00:51:27,310
She did this.

596
00:51:27,312 --> 00:51:29,447
What is this, some sort of hex?

597
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:31,749
No, I don't believe that.

598
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:34,017
You don't believe in it?

599
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:36,621
Hmm? Hmm?

600
00:51:36,623 --> 00:51:39,359
Rosie?
No.

601
00:51:42,995 --> 00:51:46,431
Not one bit?

602
00:51:46,433 --> 00:51:48,167
Not at all?

603
00:51:57,343 --> 00:52:00,578
Not...

604
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,348
one...

605
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:08,619
Not even a little bit?

606
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:10,721
Stop it.
I'm tired.

607
00:52:10,723 --> 00:52:14,024
Can we stay on a little longer?

608
00:52:14,026 --> 00:52:15,593
I need to keep working
on Stanley.

609
00:52:15,595 --> 00:52:17,428
Would you mind?

610
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:21,298
Don't get any ideas.

611
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,733
Not even a little idea?

612
00:52:22,735 --> 00:52:26,437
Five-minute idea?

613
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:28,372
Wake me early.

614
00:52:28,374 --> 00:52:30,608
Mm. Mm.

615
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,645
Stop it.
I'm sleeping.

616
00:54:28,293 --> 00:54:32,262
You want to replace my Mourning
Ballads lecture with your own?

617
00:54:32,264 --> 00:54:33,296
Of course I'm not
going to touch

618
00:54:33,298 --> 00:54:34,398
any of the Delta spirituals.

619
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,834
Freddie, Freddie.

620
00:54:36,836 --> 00:54:39,169
Let things settle, shall we?

621
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:40,338
There's one other thing.

622
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,305
Oh, joy.
There's more.

623
00:54:44,477 --> 00:54:47,411
I would like you to read
my dissertation.

624
00:54:47,413 --> 00:54:48,879
Son, easy.

625
00:54:48,881 --> 00:54:50,748
You're under a lot of pressure
with the baby.

626
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,283
No, no. This has nothing to do
with the baby.

627
00:54:53,285 --> 00:54:54,821
I would like you to recommend
my work to your editor.

628
00:54:58,491 --> 00:54:59,824
Of course I've read
your dissertation.

629
00:54:59,826 --> 00:55:01,792
Of course I have.

630
00:55:01,794 --> 00:55:05,496
Well, how did you think
you got this job?

631
00:55:05,498 --> 00:55:06,964
Alright, good talk.

632
00:55:06,966 --> 00:55:10,368
Now run out that steam, hmm?

633
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:12,603
Vigors of youth!

634
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:14,340
Wasted on the young.

635
00:55:20,647 --> 00:55:24,314
Shirl!

636
00:55:24,316 --> 00:55:27,818
That boy who's had everything
handed to him...

637
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,988
Ivy education, perfect teeth.

638
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,957
We would never behave like that.

639
00:55:32,959 --> 00:55:36,226
- Alka-Seltzer.
- We were always the outsiders.

640
00:55:36,228 --> 00:55:38,261
Everywhere we went,
we fought for every

641
00:55:38,263 --> 00:55:41,465
last crumb that was accidentally
dropped in our path,

642
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:43,567
but these entitled pricks

643
00:55:43,569 --> 00:55:45,569
just expect the world
to be handed to them

644
00:55:45,571 --> 00:55:47,338
like it's their divine right.

645
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,272
Why don't you just
give him a lecture?

646
00:55:49,274 --> 00:55:51,342
What's the harm?
I built that class.

647
00:55:51,344 --> 00:55:53,944
I built that department.
Year upon year, I did that,

648
00:55:53,946 --> 00:55:58,482
and he dashes off
some mediocre dissertation.

649
00:55:58,484 --> 00:56:01,686
- Which you didn't read.
- I didn't need to!

650
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:03,688
Just tell him no.

651
00:56:06,793 --> 00:56:08,592
No.

652
00:56:08,594 --> 00:56:11,294
He's played the system.

653
00:56:11,296 --> 00:56:14,266
Over my dead body will
that boy be getting tenure.

654
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:22,642
Give him enough rope,
and he will hang himself.

655
00:56:26,913 --> 00:56:29,682
- Good point.
- Mm-hmm.

656
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:33,386
You're getting on well
with the wifey.

657
00:56:35,421 --> 00:56:37,255
She has her moments.

658
00:56:40,593 --> 00:56:44,995
I might say you are
smitten with her.

659
00:56:44,997 --> 00:56:47,398
I don't smote.

00:57:59,906 --> 00:58:01,705
Fred.

674
00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:06,877
Fred Nemser, stepping in
for Professor Hyman... today.

675
00:58:06,879 --> 00:58:11,415
So, okay.
Well...

676
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:15,085
Uh, yes.
Yes, let's start with this one.

677
00:58:15,087 --> 00:58:18,656
Can anyone tell me...

678
00:58:18,658 --> 00:58:24,063
Can anyone identify
that musical excerpt?

679
00:58:26,165 --> 00:58:28,666
No.

680
00:58:28,668 --> 00:58:31,101
Do we need to hear it again?

681
00:58:31,103 --> 00:58:34,505
- Use the good china!
- I'm looking.

682
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:35,739
And the silver.

683
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:40,044
Professor Nemser
is home, ladies!

684
00:58:40,046 --> 00:58:41,645
Ladies...
Hi.

685

...fetch the good
professor a cocktail.

686
00:58:44,984 --> 00:58:46,984
- So it went well?
- Oh, he was a triumph!

687
00:58:46,986 --> 00:58:48,652
A triumph, I tell you!

688
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:51,822
Had all the gals eating out
of the palm of his hand.

689
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:53,691

- I did all right.

690
00:58:53,693 --> 00:58:55,426
Shirley, get out here!

691

You're not drinking alone.

714
00:59:55,554 --> 00:59:57,187
Thank you.

715
00:59:57,189 --> 00:59:58,891
Cheers.

716
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:04,897
I was reading my way through
your dissertation last night.

717
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:10,868
I've actually read it twice.

718
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:14,571
Both times, last night.
You were right.

719
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:15,940
I only skimmed it before,

720
01:00:15,942 --> 01:00:18,909
but it was sufficient
to hire you.

721
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:20,678
Oh, that's excellent.

722
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,846
I'm trying to figure the word
I'd use to sum it up.

723
01:00:22,848 --> 01:00:24,715
Well, you can use several.

724
01:00:24,717 --> 01:00:27,017
I thought it was very engaging
for an academic...

725
01:00:27,019 --> 01:00:29,954
I've got it.

726
01:00:29,956 --> 01:00:32,024
Let's see.
It was...

727
01:00:34,126 --> 01:00:35,861
...derivative.

728
01:00:39,532 --> 01:00:41,932
I-In... In what ways
is it derivative?

729
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:46,670
Oh, in the ways that it was
all derived from others' work.

730
01:00:46,672 --> 01:00:50,874
I spent years and years and
hundreds of hours of research...

731
01:00:50,876 --> 01:00:52,176
read everything.
Yes.

732
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:55,145
I'm sure.
But you didn't do any thinking.

733
01:00:55,147 --> 01:00:58,082
Just the same old chattering on,
no new ideas.

734
01:00:58,084 --> 01:01:00,684
No new ideas?
I think you're oversimplifying.

735
01:01:00,686 --> 01:01:02,119
Darling, you're hardly
the first person

736
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:03,887
to hear this lecture.

737
01:01:03,889 --> 01:01:08,092
Originality isn't something
one can simply will to manifest.

738
01:01:08,094 --> 01:01:09,960
Is that right, my dear?
If it were only true.

739
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:11,695
No.

740
01:01:11,697 --> 01:01:16,266
Originality is
the brilliant alchemy

741
01:01:16,268 --> 01:01:20,604
of critical thought
and creativity.

742
01:01:20,606 --> 01:01:22,775
And your work is so original?

743
01:01:25,044 --> 01:01:27,011
Who am I to say?

744
01:01:27,013 --> 01:01:30,681
But it has been said of me.

745
01:01:30,683 --> 01:01:32,616
Have you ever thought
about teaching

746
01:01:32,618 --> 01:01:34,184
at the high school level?

747
01:01:34,186 --> 01:01:35,719
Exceedingly rewarding.

748
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:38,557
I'm going in the bedroom
to refresh my...

749
01:01:45,965 --> 01:01:47,800
Now you've done it.

750
01:01:51,037 --> 01:01:53,005
Was it really that bad?

751
01:01:55,074 --> 01:01:59,043
You know how insulted I am
by mediocrity.

752
01:01:59,045 --> 01:02:03,947
If it was awful,
it would've been exciting.

753
01:02:03,949 --> 01:02:07,787
But terrifically competent...

754
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:13,059
...there's no excuse for that.

755
01:02:16,162 --> 01:02:17,694
I respect your opinion.

756
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:20,130
I really do, but it's not shared
by the Dean.

757
01:02:20,132 --> 01:02:22,032
Not at all.

758
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:24,201
Perhaps we can discuss this
next Friday

759
01:02:24,203 --> 01:02:26,003
at the faculty party?

760
01:02:26,005 --> 01:02:28,972
- Splendid.
- It's that time of year again.

761
01:02:28,974 --> 01:02:30,774
The Dean's party.

762
01:02:30,776 --> 01:02:33,043
Oh, no need to bother, darling.

763
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:36,280
I know how you abhor
the hoi polloi.

764
01:02:36,282 --> 01:02:40,050
Oh, I think I can make
my annual appearance, darling.

765
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:42,088
It's the least I can do for you.

766
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:45,923
I have a lead on an apartment.

767
01:02:45,925 --> 01:02:47,392
We'll be out
before semester break.

768
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:49,159
If you get the job
in the English Department,

769
01:02:49,161 --> 01:02:50,894
we're going to have to see them
all the time,

770
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:53,130
live in the same town,
so just take the...

771
01:02:53,132 --> 01:02:55,966
I don't understand. You...
First, you want to go.

772
01:02:55,968 --> 01:02:57,701
Now I want to, and you're...
and you're trying to...

773
01:02:57,703 --> 01:02:59,670
I don't like the way
he talks to you

774
01:02:59,672 --> 01:03:01,004
any more than you do.

775
01:03:01,006 --> 01:03:02,875
This is about Shirley.

776
01:03:04,977 --> 01:03:06,143
What?

777
01:03:06,145 --> 01:03:09,079
I can see
how she relies on you.

778
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:12,318
The way she talks to you,
your secret looks.

779
01:03:13,252 --> 01:03:15,921
You sound crazy.
She's my friend.

780
01:03:17,457 --> 01:03:19,756
Women like Shirley
don't have friends.

781
01:03:39,044 --> 01:03:41,912
If we are going to be
treated to a scene,

782
01:03:41,914 --> 01:03:45,883
I, for one, would love
to be forewarned.

783
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:48,018
I'm not one for dramatics.

784
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,422
Yet your appearance.

785
01:03:51,724 --> 01:03:53,360
You don't look up for it,
my dear.

786
01:03:58,431 --> 01:04:00,898
I'm going to the party.

787
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,901
Well, that would require
you leaving the house.

788
01:04:03,903 --> 01:04:05,969
Something that seems
difficult for you

789
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:08,107
to manage at this point in time.

790
01:04:16,115 --> 01:04:19,417
I am going...

791
01:04:19,419 --> 01:04:21,954
to that party.

792
01:05:09,902 --> 01:05:12,304
Shirley, do you need me
to get you another size?

793
01:05:14,273 --> 01:05:16,173
Here.

794
01:05:16,175 --> 01:05:18,509
I found something that I think
is going to look good on you.

795
01:05:18,511 --> 01:05:21,546
You want to try it on?
Hmm?

796
01:05:21,548 --> 01:05:24,881
What do you think?

797
01:05:24,883 --> 01:05:26,950
Hmm?

798
01:05:26,952 --> 01:05:28,386
Here.

799
01:05:56,181 --> 01:05:59,617
See?

800
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:02,520
Stunning.

801
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:17,535
Do you think
she killed herself?

802
01:06:17,537 --> 01:06:19,202
Paula?

803
01:06:27,246 --> 01:06:30,113
Do you think she went
to the woods to kill herself?

804
01:06:57,344 --> 01:06:59,276
Let's pray for a boy.

805
01:07:05,217 --> 01:07:08,386
The world is too cruel to girls.

806
01:07:46,426 --> 01:07:49,327
"Paula was seized with the
desire to tell her friend

807
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:52,062
every single thought
she had ever had.

808
01:07:52,064 --> 01:07:54,197
And after she had done that,

809
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:57,033
Paula herself would cease
to exist

810
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:59,537
because there would be
no more thoughts,

811
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:02,105
no more words.

812
01:08:02,107 --> 01:08:07,978
And then she would be free
to do anything she pleased...

813
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,215
because she wasn't there
anymore.

814
01:08:55,795 --> 01:08:58,028
Come here.

815
01:08:58,030 --> 01:08:59,630
Come here.

816
01:09:10,108 --> 01:09:11,744
You are hiding something.

817
01:09:16,215 --> 01:09:18,250
- No, I'm not.
- Hmm.

818
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:35,225
And you find that
every semester?

819
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:54,480
Darling, you're making
a mess of your meal.

820
01:10:56,883 --> 01:10:58,716
Did you know your wife
was such a good cook

821
01:10:58,718 --> 01:11:00,451
before you married her?

822
01:11:00,453 --> 01:11:01,919
She's a better cook
than my mother.

823
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:04,187
Oh, come now.
That's not true.

824
01:11:04,189 --> 01:11:07,290
Such a rare thing...

825
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:10,628
to find someone who doesn't
merely feed you,

826
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:16,166
but anticipates
your needs day after day

827
01:11:16,168 --> 01:11:18,803
to sate your hunger.

828
01:11:18,805 --> 01:11:22,607
Who stokes your appetite
and leaves you feeling...

829
01:11:22,609 --> 01:11:24,377
filled.

830
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:28,546
It's truly rare.

831
01:11:28,548 --> 01:11:30,315
Don't you think, Stanley?

832
01:11:31,551 --> 01:11:33,884
Hmm.

833
01:11:33,886 --> 01:11:35,622
Rare, indeed.

834
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:39,824
Stanley, would you refill
our cook's glass?

835
01:11:39,826 --> 01:11:41,592
She has been on
her feet all day.

836
01:11:41,594 --> 01:11:43,427
No, I suddenly got very tired.

837
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:45,596
I think I'm going to have to...

838
01:11:45,598 --> 01:11:47,533
- Oh.
- ...go up to bed.

839
01:11:49,602 --> 01:11:52,403
Well, you might have a fever
or something.

840
01:11:52,405 --> 01:11:54,438
Come here.
Yes, you might.

841
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,840
You know, you're feeling
a little flush.

842
01:11:55,842 --> 01:11:57,975
I don't have anything.
I'm just tired.

843
01:11:57,977 --> 01:12:02,214
- Yeah.
- I swear, I'm just tired.

844
01:12:06,552 --> 01:12:08,686
Fred, you better go
put your wife to bed

845
01:12:08,688 --> 01:12:11,189
before she faints
in the sauerkraut.

846
01:12:18,731 --> 01:12:20,466
What are you up to?

847
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:25,772
You're unusually cheerful.

848
01:12:32,345 --> 01:12:33,946
You're going to
finish your book?

849
01:12:39,652 --> 01:12:41,387
So...

850
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:51,931
...what becomes
of your dear heroine?

851
01:13:00,339 --> 01:13:02,709
What happens to all lost girls?

852
01:13:05,411 --> 01:13:06,844
They go mad.

853
01:13:27,467 --> 01:13:31,802
The one, the only...
Shirley Jackson.

854
01:13:31,804 --> 01:13:33,337
Dean Sands.

855
01:13:33,339 --> 01:13:35,506
Caroline!
Shirley's here.

856
01:13:35,508 --> 01:13:38,576
Hello!
What a lovely skirt you have.

857
01:13:38,578 --> 01:13:40,878
What a lovely insouciant
tone you have.

858
01:13:43,015 --> 01:13:44,648
Shirley, you're too much.

859
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:46,951
I never know what
you're going to say.

860
01:13:46,953 --> 01:13:50,320
Neither do I.

861
01:13:50,322 --> 01:13:53,357
Rose, I'd love you meet
some of the other faculty wives.

862
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:54,625
Come.
Come, darling.

863
01:13:54,627 --> 01:13:57,394
- Hello.
- The Wood-Sprite.

864
01:13:57,396 --> 01:14:00,397
You terrify me.

865
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:01,832
Reading your stories...

866
01:14:01,834 --> 01:14:05,770
the world doesn't feel the same.

867
01:14:05,772 --> 01:14:08,472
The other night,
I was alone in my office,

868
01:14:08,474 --> 01:14:12,543
and I was petrified
by the paperweight on my desk.

869
01:14:12,545 --> 01:14:17,016
What if I simply lifted it up
and bashed my skull in?

870
01:14:18,651 --> 01:14:20,985
How do you do that?

871
01:14:20,987 --> 01:14:22,586
They're just stories.

872
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:24,688
No.
They are prophecies.

873
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,924
Delightful little
entertainments

874
01:14:26,926 --> 01:14:28,926
but prophecies nonetheless.

875
01:14:30,797 --> 01:14:33,764
Oh, here we go!

876
01:14:36,002 --> 01:14:37,668
♪ The stars were bright ♪

877
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:39,403
♪ My heart was light ♪

878
01:14:39,405 --> 01:14:42,473
♪ As we went whirling
through the night ♪

879
01:14:42,475 --> 01:14:46,644
♪ And soon I learned to dance ♪

880
01:14:46,646 --> 01:14:49,647
♪ The dance of love ♪

881
01:14:49,649 --> 01:14:56,921
♪ The dance of love ♪

882
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:31,488
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

883
01:15:38,764 --> 01:15:40,531
Want a Scotch?

884
01:15:40,533 --> 01:15:44,101
What are you doing
at this shindy?

885
01:15:44,103 --> 01:15:46,604
My husband,
I'm looking for him.

886
01:15:46,606 --> 01:15:47,771
Yeah. Yeah.

887
01:15:47,773 --> 01:15:50,140
We're all big fans
of your husband.

888
01:15:50,142 --> 01:15:52,977
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

889
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:54,879
Have you seen Fred?

890
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:57,081
Maybe try out on the porch.

891
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:59,884
It's the handkerchief dance.

892
01:16:26,812 --> 01:16:30,514
"Paula was long past
their sophomoric treacle,

893
01:16:30,516 --> 01:16:34,818
writhing nest of hairpin
stockings and formal gowns.

894
01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:38,122
The names they called her
penetrated intact

895
01:16:38,124 --> 01:16:39,823
through her closed door...

896
01:16:39,825 --> 01:16:43,160
creepy, loner, disturbed.

897
01:16:43,162 --> 01:16:44,895
It didn't concern her

898
01:16:44,897 --> 01:16:49,600
because when she first came
to the school, the bad...

899
01:16:49,602 --> 01:16:52,036
the bad thing happened.

900
01:16:52,038 --> 01:16:54,204
She was so frightened, and she
didn't have any friends

901
01:16:54,206 --> 01:16:58,842
and she never supposed
she would want...

902
01:16:58,844 --> 01:17:01,545
She never supposed
she would need anyone.

903
01:17:01,547 --> 01:17:05,215
But now that she had found...

904
01:17:05,217 --> 01:17:07,651
that she had found a friend...

905
01:17:07,653 --> 01:17:10,056
she felt the old fear
leaching back."

906
01:17:31,077 --> 01:17:33,744
What... What are you doing?!

907
01:17:33,746 --> 01:17:36,313
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

908
01:17:36,315 --> 01:17:38,849
What?

909
01:17:38,851 --> 01:17:41,251
No, no, no! No.

910
01:17:41,253 --> 01:17:42,853
Don't rub. Dab.

911
01:17:55,701 --> 01:17:59,105
You'd bore him to death
in a week.

912
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,907
I would comfort him.

913
01:18:03,909 --> 01:18:07,911
Well, he is an expert

914
01:18:07,913 --> 01:18:12,616
at finding a willing pair
of legs to open wide.

915
01:18:12,618 --> 01:18:14,918
You'd die without him, he says.

916
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,920
That's the only reason he stays.

917
01:18:48,921 --> 01:18:50,723
Shirley?

918
01:18:52,792 --> 01:18:55,059
Shirley?

919
01:18:55,061 --> 01:18:57,263
What happened?
Are you all right?

920
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:02,800
Take me home.

921
01:19:56,889 --> 01:19:59,156
Who do you see?

922
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:01,859
Who do you see?

923
01:20:01,861 --> 01:20:04,194
You see tired mama.

924
01:20:04,196 --> 01:20:06,196
Huh?

925
01:20:14,206 --> 01:20:16,140
I know.

926
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:28,719
I know.

927
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:46,303
You're never here!

928
01:20:46,305 --> 01:20:49,376
Rosie. Rose.
Stop. Please.

929
01:21:15,267 --> 01:21:16,869
Stanley!

930
01:21:19,339 --> 01:21:21,106
You rang, madam?

931
01:21:23,809 --> 01:21:25,075
Uh!

932
01:21:33,085 --> 01:21:36,153
- Out.
- We're drinking Scotch

933
01:21:36,155 --> 01:21:38,956
because you worked
straight through dinner, dear,

934
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:43,961
as is your habit, apparently,
these many, many weeks.

935
01:21:43,963 --> 01:21:46,997
And I'm here to say,
I'm sick of it.

936
01:21:46,999 --> 01:21:48,466
I hate sitting
at the table alone.

937
01:21:48,468 --> 01:21:50,801
It makes me feel like a widower.

938
01:21:50,803 --> 01:21:53,471
Or worse,
a decrepit feudal lord.

939
01:21:53,473 --> 01:21:58,476
You know, you've left me
in a... a vexing position.

940
01:21:58,478 --> 01:22:01,446
And the children in bed
by 9:00 with their little one.

941
01:22:01,448 --> 01:22:04,047
Take pity.

942
01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:06,984
Hmm.

943
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:08,486
Won't you let me read it,
darling?

944
01:22:08,488 --> 01:22:11,154
No.

945
01:22:11,156 --> 01:22:12,359
It's nothing yet.

946
01:22:18,097 --> 01:22:22,099
The thing is, Stanley,
I don't know if it ever will be.

947
01:22:22,101 --> 01:22:24,067
I have no idea of an ending.

948
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:26,837
Well, all the more reason
for me to...

949
01:22:26,839 --> 01:22:28,905
have a peek.

950
01:22:28,907 --> 01:22:31,275
Has the little wifey read it?

951
01:22:31,277 --> 01:22:33,143
Yes, of course.

952
01:22:33,145 --> 01:22:37,147
She's a regular William Shawn.

953
01:22:37,149 --> 01:22:39,983
She comes in here,
and we sit by the fire,

954
01:22:39,985 --> 01:22:42,553
and she gives me line edits.

955
01:22:42,555 --> 01:22:45,188
And then she scurries back
into the kitchen

956
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:46,892
to make me supper.

957
01:22:50,497 --> 01:22:52,162
Stanley, don't be mad at me.

958
01:22:52,164 --> 01:22:53,564
No.

959
01:22:53,566 --> 01:22:57,368
It's the genre, darling,
that's stymying you.

960
01:22:57,370 --> 01:23:00,571
It's not your arena.

961
01:23:00,573 --> 01:23:02,509
And frankly, it's beneath you.

962
01:23:07,514 --> 01:23:10,881
- Keep your theories to yourself.
- Well, you didn't know her.

963
01:23:10,883 --> 01:23:13,183
Don't tell me that I do
not know this girl.

964
01:23:13,185 --> 01:23:17,054
Look, I might have walked
by her a dozen times on campus.

965
01:23:17,056 --> 01:23:18,989
There's nothing fascinating
about this girl,

966
01:23:18,991 --> 01:23:20,991
except that she's gone.

967
01:23:20,993 --> 01:23:22,327
What has she done?

968
01:23:22,329 --> 01:23:24,094
You don't know your subject.

969
01:23:24,096 --> 01:23:27,197
She's a nothing.
Who is she to you?

970
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:31,201
There are dozens and dozens
of girls like this

971
01:23:31,203 --> 01:23:34,104
littering campuses
across the country.

972
01:23:34,106 --> 01:23:38,643
Lonely girls who cannot
make the world see them.

973
01:23:38,645 --> 01:23:41,244
Do not tell me I do
not know this girl.

974
01:23:41,246 --> 01:23:42,948
Don't you dare!

975
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,284
Oh.

976
01:23:47,286 --> 01:23:49,288
So you think
it might be that good.

977
01:23:58,598 --> 01:24:00,997
- Oh, you...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

978
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:03,268
Get out!
Out!

979
01:24:17,484 --> 01:24:21,320
Might it be time then to send
the little children away?

980
01:24:33,733 --> 01:24:35,966
Oh, I didn't know you
came home last night.

981
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:37,335
Oh, I didn't want to wake you.

982
01:24:37,337 --> 01:24:40,170
I slept on the sofa
in Stanley's study.

983
01:24:40,172 --> 01:24:41,907
We had a nightcap.

984
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:46,209
Mm. Is there coffee?

985
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:48,415
You smell like a gin bath.

986
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:54,585
Oh, I ran out of eggs, so...

987
01:24:54,587 --> 01:24:57,020
By the way,
Stanley found us a place.

988
01:24:57,022 --> 01:24:58,223
What?

989
01:25:00,693 --> 01:25:02,360
We get to move out in a week.

990
01:25:51,176 --> 01:25:53,377
Stanley's kicking us out.

991
01:26:09,529 --> 01:26:13,664
Don't we have anything sweet
around here to eat?

992
01:26:23,676 --> 01:26:26,711
Okay.

993
01:26:26,713 --> 01:26:30,146
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

994
01:27:09,455 --> 01:27:11,156
Shirley?

995
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:16,159
Shirley?

996
01:27:30,242 --> 01:27:31,475
Shh.

997
01:27:43,221 --> 01:27:45,322
Can you get me that book?

998
01:27:45,324 --> 01:27:47,257
Um...

999
01:27:47,259 --> 01:27:49,560
The blue one on top.

1000
01:27:49,562 --> 01:27:52,930
- This one?
- Yes.

1001
01:27:52,932 --> 01:27:54,632
Thank you.

1002
01:28:03,676 --> 01:28:07,645
This is, um,
Stanley's syllabus,

1003
01:28:07,647 --> 01:28:11,515
and, uh...

1004
01:28:11,517 --> 01:28:14,821
the last name on the list
before mine is Paula's...

1005
01:28:16,889 --> 01:28:22,860
...which means that she was
taking his class maybe

1006
01:28:22,862 --> 01:28:25,230
at the time
that she disappeared.

1007
01:29:09,342 --> 01:29:11,611
I know who my husband
is screwing.

1008
01:29:15,882 --> 01:29:17,617
Do you know who yours has?

1009
01:29:20,887 --> 01:29:22,622
Fred hasn't.

1010
01:29:24,757 --> 01:29:29,595
See, there's no such thing
as the Shakespeare Society.

1011
01:29:34,934 --> 01:29:40,303
It's just how the girls pick...

1012
01:29:40,305 --> 01:29:43,208
which professors
that they're going to fuck.

1013
01:29:47,413 --> 01:29:48,915
Shirley.

1014
01:29:55,655 --> 01:29:58,622
Shirley!

1015
01:29:58,624 --> 01:29:59,824
Open the door!

1016
01:30:04,697 --> 01:30:07,934
Shirley, please!

1017
01:30:11,003 --> 01:30:13,904
You knew this whole time?!

1018
01:30:13,906 --> 01:30:16,507
Why didn't you tell me
six months ago?

1019
01:30:18,511 --> 01:30:21,712
Shirley!

1020
01:30:21,714 --> 01:30:25,516
Shirley, open the door, please.

1021
01:30:29,522 --> 01:30:31,958
I trusted you!

01:31:32,685 --> 01:31:35,419
so you could go off and...
Listen. Listen.

1046
01:31:35,421 --> 01:31:38,756

Stay away from me!

Get the baby inside.

1054

I don't want to go home.

1055
01:32:15,728 --> 01:32:18,831
Where do you want to go, dear?
I'll take you wherever you want.

1056
01:32:25,571 --> 01:32:27,473
I want to go to the trailhead.

1057
01:32:31,444 --> 01:32:32,778
Alright.

1058
01:32:35,047 --> 01:32:36,780
You've seen it.
Let's go.

1059
01:32:41,487 --> 01:32:44,521
Will you hold her
for just a second?

1060
01:32:44,523 --> 01:32:46,757
Rose!

1061
01:32:46,759 --> 01:32:47,958
Come.

1062
01:32:49,795 --> 01:32:52,763
Okay.
Come here, baby.

1063
01:32:52,765 --> 01:32:54,198
Rose, come back!

1064
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,072
Rose!

1065
01:33:11,183 --> 01:33:12,816
Rose!

1066
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:12,609
Step away, Rose.

1067
01:34:29,128 --> 01:34:30,930
Step away!

1068
01:34:33,099 --> 01:34:34,665
You were right.

1069
01:34:34,667 --> 01:34:37,634
It doesn't take any energy
at all.

1070
01:34:37,636 --> 01:34:39,138
It's just a hop.

1071
01:34:43,275 --> 01:34:47,211
Just slide the right
foot forward,

1072
01:34:47,213 --> 01:34:49,313
and it could all be over.

1073
01:35:32,191 --> 01:35:35,192
You'll feel better again
in no time.

1074
01:35:35,194 --> 01:35:36,894
I feel fine now.

1075
01:35:36,896 --> 01:35:38,898
You know what I mean.

1076
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:45,738
A little rest,
a little time away...

1077
01:35:47,673 --> 01:35:50,774
...everything will be back
to normal.

1078
01:35:50,776 --> 01:35:53,877
No, no, no, no, no.

1079
01:35:53,879 --> 01:35:56,215
I'm not going back to that.

1080
01:36:01,053 --> 01:36:03,720
Little wifey.

1081
01:36:03,722 --> 01:36:05,224
Little Rosie.

1082
01:36:09,329 --> 01:36:11,895
That was madness.

1083
01:39:34,601 --> 01:39:38,203
Your book
is brilliant, darling.

1084
01:39:45,545 --> 01:39:47,380
Fucking gorgeous.

1085
01:39:51,216 --> 01:39:52,951
I don't know how you did it.

1086
01:39:59,459 --> 01:40:01,528
I have a few notes, of course.

1087
01:40:05,164 --> 01:40:06,865
Of course.

1088
01:40:09,301 --> 01:40:11,170
This is going to be the one.

1089
01:40:14,206 --> 01:40:15,908
Don't lose sight of that.

1090
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:21,280
It hurts.

1091
01:40:24,216 --> 01:40:26,085
This one.

1092
01:40:30,189 --> 01:40:32,525
It hurts more than the others.

1093
01:40:37,497 --> 01:40:41,164

00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:46,503
Over and over.

332
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:49,547
That I don't know
when it's time to call it quits.

333
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,094
[exhales sharply]

334
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:58,640
And I'll be the one gets the job of
picking up those pieces, huh?

335
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:11,820
Hey.

336
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,698
- [horse whinnies]
- [man shushing]

337
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:18,118
No, no, no. You just hold it.

338
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:19,578
Hold it right there.

339
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:21,246
I didn't take nothing, all right?
I just...

340
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,581
You were just what?

341
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:25,501
Well, I was fishing.

342
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:26,752
[George] Fishing?

343
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,964
Fishing around this car?

344
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,424
Well, no. No, sir.

345
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:34,259
No, I'm just coming from fishing.

346
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:37,554
I just seen your car,
and I was just wondering

347
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:39,932
who's setting up camp out here,
that's all.

348
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:43,227
- Who are you?
- Peter Dragswolf, sir.

349
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:45,646
I live over there.

350
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,397
Have my own place.

351
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:51,068
I've got my own money too.
I don't need none of your goods.

352
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,654
I'm Margaret Blackledge, Mr. Dragswolf.

353
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:56,365
That's my husband George.

354
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:59,034
I apologize if we're trespassing.

355
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,953
And what's this fella's name?

356
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,914
I can't say.
He don't belong to me.

357
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:07,042
Just showed up
outside my shack one morning.

358
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:10,420
I thought he was wild at first,
but he come from somewhere.

359
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:11,964
I don't know.

360
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,591
But he found me.

361
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,760
[chuckles]

362
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:19,346
Same as us.

363
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:26,270
[Margaret laughing]

364
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:33,569
Maybe the horse belongs to her.

365
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,990
Near about every horse does.

366
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:44,913
- [Margaret chuckles]
- [horse nickers]

367
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:56,008
I used to ride.

368
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,801
[George] She's being modest with you.

369
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,470
I used to break horses.

370
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:02,598
[chuckles]

371
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:05,642
With our son. James.

372
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,353
Then he died.

373
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:14,193
And I guess I lost my appetite for it.

374
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,613
Haven't kept animals in quite a while.

375
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:21,366
It's nice to spend some time
with a sweet one like yours.

376
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,703
What about you?
How long you been out here?

377
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:28,081
Three years.

378
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,542
All on your own? No family?

379
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:34,546
[George] Where were you before?

380
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,512
Indian school, sir.

381
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:43,847
You don't have to call me "sir."

382
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,350
"George" will do the job.

383
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:52,981
You finished that school?
How old are you?

384
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:01,281
I don't bother anybody.

385
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:06,036
You know, if somebody comes for the horse,
they can have him back.

386
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,747
The skins I sell, those animals I catch.

387
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,291
The fish are free, and I don't steal.

388
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:15,254
- I mind my own business.
- Peter, come. Have some cake.

389
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:17,422
Why don't you sit back
at the fire with us?

390
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,684
[sighs]

391
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:34,147
You're familiar with the area, though?
Gladstone?

392
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,235
I can tell you where the folks are buried
that ain't buried in the cemeteries.

393
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:40,445
Weboys?

394
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,740
You had any dealings with them?

395
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:48,871
We're looking for our grandson.

396
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:50,414
Our boy's boy.

397
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,959
He's with a man named Donnie Weboy.

398
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,128
- You ever heard of him?
- No.

399
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:59,298
No, but if you're looking in Gladstone,

400
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:00,883
look for Bill Weboy.

401
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:02,301
You think he'd help us?

402
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,720
Help, maybe.

403
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,640
But go careful.

404
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:23,030
There it is. Yellow house.

405
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:36,919
[brakes squeak]

406
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:39,588
[engine off]

407
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,973
- Mr. Weboy?
- Who's asking?

408
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:51,725
Margaret Blackledge.

409
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,061
And my husband George.

410
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:58,982
[chuckles] If you're a Weboy,
we're family, after a fashion.

411
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,692
[chuckling] How you figure that?

412
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:03,278
Bill Weboy. A cousin, are you?

413
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:07,032
[Margaret] Oh.
Could be, but probably not exactly.

414
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,870
Our former daughter-in-law
married a Donnie Weboy.

415
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:14,122
He's stepdad to our grandson now.

416
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:16,500
That's pretty tangled up, isn't it?

417
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,919
- Family usually is.
- [chuckles]

418
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:24,132
We heard they might have come
to settle here in Gladstone.

419
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:27,386
We thought we'd pay a visit,
see our grandson Jimmy,

420
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:28,887
since we're in the neighborhood.

421
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,640
Since you're in the neighborhood.

422
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:34,560
And since you didn't find them
up in Forsyth.

423
00:40:34,643 --> 00:40:36,436
[gasps, laughs]

424
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:40,858
- You heard we were coming, did you?
- I did. I did.

425
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:42,776
A little birdie flew over here
ahead of you.

426
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,279
- Cheep, ch-cheep, cheep...
- Are they here or not?

427
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:49,366
Is he always like that,
in a big old hurry?

428
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,368
My husband likes to get down to business.

429
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:54,037
Hell of a lot of men are like that.
Can't wait to get where they're going.

430
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:59,960
Women, in my experience,
would as soon take their time.

431
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,962
Enjoy the ride, so to speak.

432
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:05,757
- Mr. Weboy, I'm gonna tell you one time...
- I'm just funnin' you, George.

433
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,885
They're here. Donnie's my nephew.

434
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:11,013
They're safe and sound
over at his mom's place.

435
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:12,973
[snickers]

436
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:15,559
Why don't we head on inside
and give the old homestead a call.

437
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,729
Hell, you might be able
to drive over this morning,

438
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,981
see that little precious
grandson of yours.

439
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:31,158
[rotary phone dialing]

440
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,452
Hey, Mabel.

441
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:36,121
Can you put me through to the ranch?

442
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,543
Blanche, it's Bill.

443
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:43,545
What? What is it?

444
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,090
[Bill] Uh-huh. Got 'em right here.

445
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:50,928
- [whispering] What?
- You don't want this man's help.

446
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:54,556
- [Bill] See you soon.
- We can't do this on our own.

447
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,891
[phone hangs up]

448
00:41:58,477 --> 00:41:59,937
You two have plans for supper?

449
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,980
We surely don't.

450
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:05,275
How'd you like to be guests
of the Weboy clan out at the ranch?

451
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:09,238
- We don't want to be any trouble.
- No trouble at all.

452
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,240
My sister-in-law wants to meet you.

453
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:16,078
She wants to swap some old
grandpa and grandma stories.

454
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,288
And between you and me,
she's a hell of a cook.

455
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:20,791
Well, you'd have to give us directions.

456
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:22,709
Nope. Not a chance.

457
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:26,004
I could be the best damn direction giver
in the world, and you'd never find her.

458
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:28,257
You'd be out there wandering
around Four Bridges Road

459
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,050
and never see a one. No.

460
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:34,096
You make your way back here at 4:00,
and you can follow me.

461
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,808
Thank you. We'll come back then.

462
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:43,397

466
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,918
About time.

467
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:08,755
One of you should ride with me
and the other follow.

468
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:10,799
I could tell you
where we're going and why,

469
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:14,511
and that way, maybe you can
find your way back on your own.

470
00:43:22,352 --> 00:43:23,604
Well...

471
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:26,315
Where do you think you're going?

472
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:28,400
You think he wants you
in the passenger seat?

473
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:30,235
No.

474
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,862
I know he doesn't.

475
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:38,410
I don't care what he wants.
I'm going. You drive.

476
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:39,786
- It's fine, George.
- Margaret.

477
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,455
Margaret. Margaret, get back in...

478
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,373
Follow close.

479
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,147
Pretty bird, that old jalopy
won't have trouble keeping up, will it?

480
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:09,900
You're looking in the mirror often enough.
You can see where he is.

481
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,945
I guess he just don't want you
to get too far out of his sight.

482
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:15,113
- Which I understand.
- [glove compartment opens]

483
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:17,658
You mind?

484
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,620
It's your car.
You don't need my permission.

485
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:26,208
You strike me as the kind of woman
men are always asking permission of.

486
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:28,168
An expert, are you?

487
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:29,503
[lighter clicks]

488
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:36,009
I've been around more than a few women

00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:39,221
who want men to ask
before drawing a breath.

490
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,265
[laughing]

491
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:43,851
We turn here.

492
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:46,019
Why don't you signal
so George knows what's coming?

493
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,859
- [turn signal ticking]
- Aye, aye, captain.

494
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:15,549
How much further is it?

495
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:18,135
Uh, "farther." "How much farther is it?"

496
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:20,971
Or do you mean how much more of me
do you have to put up with?

497
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:23,182
We just want to see Jimmy.

498
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:24,516
Yeah.

499
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:27,644
He's a good-looking boy there.

500
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:30,314
And his mother's a fine-looking woman.

501
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:36,945
You know, Donnie never asked me
for a word of advice in his life.

502
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:39,156
[laughs] You don't say.

503
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,574
And if he had,

504
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,910
I would've told him to do
exactly what he's done.

505
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:45,120
"Marry yourself a widow, Donnie.

506
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:46,747
You'll be getting a grateful woman."

507
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:32,251
[engines stop]

508
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:36,171
[thunder rumbling]

509
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:43,554
Never would've found this place
on your own, am I right?

510
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:46,223
Was I right?

511
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,016
Through here.

512
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:52,688
Blanche!

513
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:55,607
We're here.

514
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:58,777
Blanche?

515
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:21,508
I hope you like pork chops.

516
00:47:25,888 --> 00:47:27,806
- You're the grandma.
- I am.

517
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,183
Margaret Blackledge.

518
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:31,018
Blanche Weboy.

519
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:32,686
Thanks for having us.

520
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:34,146
And you're the lawman.

521
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:36,773
Retired, ma'am. George Blackledge.

522
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:41,570
Well, why don't we all retire
to a seat at the table, huh?

523
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:43,780
Shall we?

524
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:52,247
Now, who can I interest in a glass? Hmm?

525
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:53,832
Oh, no, thank you.

526
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:56,502
- [Blanche] Hmm?
- [quietly] No.

527
00:47:57,586 --> 00:47:59,296
Ah. Well...

528
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:02,132
I don't mind drinking alone.

529
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:04,176
[Blanche laughs]

530
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,269
My people originally came from Illinois.

531
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:19,608
Filed a homestead claim north of Gladstone
before there was a Gladstone.

532
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:22,110
I'm one of eight.

533
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:26,740
Lost an older sister to pneumonia.

534
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:30,619
My brother Carl drowned
in a neighbor's cistern.

535
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:34,873
Another fell off a truck, lived in
a wheelchair for the rest of his days.

536
00:48:34,957 --> 00:48:37,543
My aunt Ruth got caught in a whiteout,

537
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:39,711
froze and died right where she stood,

538
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:42,631
not 30 feet from that back door.

539
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:45,259
Hard life.

540
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:47,344
Not for everyone.

541
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:54,977
[laughs] My other brothers and sister
lit out, soon as they could.

542
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,145
Never looked back.

543
00:49:00,607 --> 00:49:01,733
I stayed.

544
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,488
When I first met Henry Weboy,

545
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:10,367
he couldn't stop talking about
heading for Florida.

546
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,660
[chuckles]

547
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:16,707
I figure I had more than a little to do
with his decision to stay.

548
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,417
[laughs]

549
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:26,216
Now he's buried in the same cemetery
as my folks and his.

550
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:28,886
Yeah.

551
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:32,931
And my boys are fourth-generation Weboys,

552
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:36,393
born and living on North Dakota soil.

553
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:46,403
But you didn't come here to hear me yak.
[laughs]

554
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:49,406
You came to eat! Ha!

555
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:54,328
Why don't you call the boys in
for supper, huh?

556
00:49:54,912 --> 00:49:56,538
I'll be back in a jiffy.

557
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:58,498
[oven door opens]

558
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,793
[Blanche] I suppose you could tell a story

559
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:05,255
not a hell of a lot different, am I right?

560
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:07,508
About family,

561
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:10,844
hardships, sacrifice, blood.

562
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:12,054
[door opens]

563
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:14,014
Ah, meet the boys.

564
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:15,265
Tall one's Elton.

565
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:16,934
The other's Marvin.

566
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:19,561
Say hello to our guests.

567
00:50:20,479 --> 00:50:22,606
That your wagon out there?

568
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:26,068
We tried to get inside, take a look.

569
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,863
Tighten a couple bolts, we could probably
get you a few more horses.

570
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,285
Where's Jimmy? Where's the boy?

571
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:37,538
Why, he's not here.

572
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:39,414
- He's with his father.
- His father...

573
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,252
We came to see our grandson.

574
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:46,046
You mean you didn't come here
to eat my pork chops?

575
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:48,423
[Weboys laugh]

576
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:51,218
If you brought us all the way out here
for the sake of a joke...

577
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:54,221
Lorna said you were rough bark.

578
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:56,974
And I can see already
you're no day at the races.

579
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:58,767
No, ma'am. [laughs]

580
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:01,979
Come on, everybody. Sit down.

581
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:04,815
It's not gonna get any better cold.

582
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:13,991
[Bill groans]

583
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,161
Your grandson's with my Donnie.

584
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:22,416
He took Jimmy along to pick up
the boy's mother from work.

585
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:23,792
Lorna?

586
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:26,170
She's working at Monkey Ward.

587
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:30,215
We could've seen Jimmy and Lorna
in Gladstone?

588
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:32,301
Oh, now I am feeling insulted by you.

589
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:34,636
You really don't give a damn
about sharing a meal.

590
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,763
- I just meant...
- Or maybe you're a Jew.

591
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,267
Maybe you can't eat pork chops.

592
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:45,355
[laughs]

593
00:51:45,439 --> 00:51:47,357
Breathe easy.

594
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:50,152
Anyone who knows me
knows I can't be insulted.

595
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:52,529
Eat my chops or don't.

596
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:56,033
Well, we'd certainly hoped to
meet Donnie's family someday.

597
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:57,576
Oh, had you?

598
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:01,496
Well, I'm glad to learn that.

599
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:05,250
Yeah, I thought we should meet too.

600
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:08,545
Have ourselves a chat.

601
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:12,841
Would've been nice if it had
been at the wedding, but...

602
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,512
maybe it was too much to ask
for his mother to be invited

603
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:17,596
or his brothers.

604
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:19,056
- Or poor Uncle Bill.
- [Blanche] Yeah.

605
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,642
- You weren't invited?
- You recollect seeing us there?

606
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:24,144
And that's our fault?

607
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:28,357
You didn't stop to think to yourselves,
"He must've come from somewhere.

608
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,317
Must have family."

609
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:37,282
Frankly, we thought only that
Donnie was a grown man.

610
00:52:42,788 --> 00:52:44,373
Your son's dead.

611
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:49,002
It's understandable you forget.

612
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:52,714
We're never really done raising them.

613
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:54,716
Teaching them the right way.

614
00:52:57,302 --> 00:52:59,221
It's why I had to bring my boy home.

615
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:03,058
To keep an eye on him.

616
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:06,603
Your boy's perfect now.

617
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,273
It's not really fair
to compare him and Donnie.

618
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:12,067
I wouldn't ever compare Donnie to our son.

619
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:14,820
[Blanche] Yeah.

620
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:15,904
[chuckles]

621
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:19,783
Yeah, he said that you two don't approve.

622
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:22,870
I'm surprised to hear
he gives a damn what we think.

623
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:27,875
He couldn't be bothered
to tell us they were leaving.

624
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:30,627
My boy doesn't have to answer to you.

625
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:33,255
[chuckles] No, he...

626
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:35,340
he does not.

627
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:38,594
And we don't have to answer to you.

628
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:44,224
- Whoa.
- [Weboys laugh]

629
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:46,310
Whew! [laughs]

630
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:48,520
We better get some food in our bellies

631
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:52,107
before this get-together
turns into a real blood feud.

632
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:53,901
- And we got numbers on you.
- [Blanche] Yeah.

633
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:56,278
- [laughter continues]
- [vehicle approaches]

634
00:53:56,862 --> 00:54:01,033
Oh, why, here come the newlyweds now.

635
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:04,161
- [vehicle doors closing]
- [thunder rumbling]

636
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:12,878
Lorna.

637
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,757
H-Hi, George.

638
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:20,177
Hi, Jimmy.

639
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:26,266
- May I?
- [Lorna] Oh.

640
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:33,065
[Margaret whispers] Oh...

641
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:36,151
He's turning into quite a load.

642
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:39,446
I told you, you carry him too much.

643
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,115
How's he supposed to learn?

644
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:44,451
Learn what? How to walk?
He knows how to walk.

645
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:46,328
[Donnie] Well, hell, I'd probably
unlearn how to myself

646
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:49,206
if someone carried me
everywhere I wanted to go.

647
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:52,209
It's flat-out spoiling him.

648
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,045
- He weighs nothing.
- Has he eaten?

649
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:57,172
Got him a burger at Ressler's
while we were waiting.

650
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:58,882
[Blanche] Did he eat it?

651
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:00,717
[Donnie] Half.

652
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,594
[Blanche] Do you want a pork chop, huh?

653
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,346
- Some potatoes?
- [Jimmy] No.

654
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:05,556
Huh?

655
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:08,183
- Should I cut up a little meat for you?
- No.

656
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:10,727
What was that?
What are you supposed to say?

657
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,563
No, thank you.

658
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:16,233
Take him up to bed then.

659
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,403
What? He just got here.

660
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:22,030
We believe in early to bed in this house.

661
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:26,827
And we believe in walking
upstairs on our own two feet.

662
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:34,585
[Bill] Easy now, Grandma.

663
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:39,131
You know who makes the rules around here.

664
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:43,844
[chairs scraping]

665
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:01,153
[thunder rumbling]

666
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,100
There was mustard.

667
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:34,394
There was mustard?

668
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:36,647
On your hamburger?

669
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:40,817
You don't like mustard, do you?

670
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:43,987
[Blanche clapping] Off you go!

671
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:45,322
Up the stairs!

672
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:50,035
[grunts]

673
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,373
[whispers] Come on, Jimmy.

674
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:00,045
[Margaret] Jimmy.

675
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:13,892
That's enough.

676
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,855
Well, now you know where to find us,
you'll have to visit more often.

677
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:20,482
We thank you, but we'll...

678
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:22,526
be on our way.

679
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:27,781
[Bill] Hey, Blackledges!

680
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:29,533
Hold up there!

681
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:33,537
[grunts]
You need me to show you the way?

682
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:38,125
You know, if you left
a trail of bread crumbs,

683
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:41,879
the coyotes would've got 'em by now,
or they're washed away. [chuckles]

684
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:47,551
You know, she won't say so,

685
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:51,180
but I can tell, you running off like this,
you hurt Blanche's feelings.

686
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:52,890
Her feelings?

687
00:57:52,973 --> 00:57:55,475
We've come all this way to see Jimmy,

688
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:58,270
and she gives us two minutes'
time to visit with him...

689
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:02,399
Go back inside, Mr. Weboy.

690
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:04,193
Why was your car locked?

691
00:58:17,456 --> 00:58:19,791
What are you doing out here?

692
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:23,837
Damned if I know.

693
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:07,297
[rain pattering]

694
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:11,426
Today's Friday, right?

695
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:14,346
It is.

696
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:18,892
Do you think Lorna will be
working tomorrow?

697
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,897
It's not quite as slimming
as this would be.

698
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:26,149
You know, beautiful white shirt like this.

699
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:28,819
- I'll take it.
- Oh.

700
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:38,245
So just these two things for you then?

701
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:39,538
Yes, thank you.

702
00:59:48,422 --> 00:59:49,965
[cash register opens,
bell dings]

703
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:51,592
- Sorry.
- [woman] That's all right.

704
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,385
7.50, ma'am.

705
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:04,396
I didn't think you'd just go home.

706
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:06,690
I'm like a bad penny.

707
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:10,444
Who watches Jimmy while you're here?

708
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:11,778
Who do you think?

709
01:00:11,862 --> 01:00:13,906
Donnie. His mom.

710
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:19,578
Or maybe you think I just tie him
to a tree until I get home.

711
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:26,585
- You're a good mother, Lorna. I know that.
- Right.

712
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:31,882
I was merely wondering how things
are going for you with this new job.

713
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:34,510
Well, I just started, so...

714
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:38,639
We don't want to get you
in trouble, sweetheart.

715
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,224
Can we buy you lunch?

716
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,809
- My break isn't until noon.
- [Margaret] Noon?

717
01:00:42,893 --> 01:00:45,562
- Straight up?
- We'll meet you outside.

718
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:48,607
No, I'll meet you at Ressler's.

719
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,067
It's across the street.

720
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,152
[chattering]

721
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:02,371
[Lorna] <i>I was going to write.
Once we got settled.</i>

722
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:07,084
It was kind of a last-minute decision,
coming here.

723
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:12,172
- That Donnie's decision?
- You met Blanche.

724
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:16,593
Well, we found you.
That's what's important.

725
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,637
Jimmy looks bigger.

726
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,430
- He's growing so fast.
- [waitress] There you are.

727
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:22,266
He's counting to ten now.

728
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:26,395
He used to just say the words, you know,
but now he understands they go in order.

729
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,982
And I'm working with him on his alphabet.

730
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:31,525
He can spell his name.

731
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,611
[Margaret] Smart right from the start.

732
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:41,869
He misses you, both of you.

733
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:43,871
[sighs]

734
01:01:43,954 --> 01:01:45,497
We miss him too.

735
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,417
Both of you.

736
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,544
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about, Lorna.

737
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:53,589
And I won't... beat around the bush.

738
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:00,053
I remember when James first introduced us.

739
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:03,765
This wonderful girl
he told us so much about,

740
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:05,976
so beautiful and funny and...

741
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,603
No family of her own, but...

742
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:10,230
Thought you weren't gonna
beat around the bush.

743
01:02:10,314 --> 01:02:13,442
I have to be back at the store by 1:00.
Just get to it.

744
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:16,695
All right. Well, here it is.

745
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:21,116
Let Jimmy come back with us.

746
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:25,579
Not just to visit. I mean for good.

747
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:30,375
You...

748
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:35,047
You want me to give Jimmy to you?

749
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:37,799
- Want me to give up my son?
- [Margaret] You know he'd have

750
01:02:37,883 --> 01:02:39,760
a good home, one he knows,
one he remembers...

751
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:41,178
Stop.

752
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:43,263
You know the schools he'd go to,
the teachers he'd have...

753
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:45,641
No, God, stop! I can't hear this!

754
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:56,193
I saw Donnie hit Jimmy.

755
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:00,531
On the street.

756
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:04,535
I saw him hit you.

757
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:07,079
And it didn't look like a first time.

758
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:12,501
A little or a lot, no amount's good.

759
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:15,420
- That's why we're here...
- You came to take him.

760
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:17,005
[George] Lorna.

761
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:18,757
We came to help.

762
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:21,301
Whatever the situation is.

763
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:23,887
Jimmy can't stay there.

764
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:26,890
Can't stay here.

765
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:32,020
- He needs his mother.
- Then come with us.

766
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:34,273
You and Jimmy.
We'll take care of you.

767
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:36,191
Live with us, like before.

768
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:37,401
Tuna.

769
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:41,697
- [George] You come and stay with us.
- [waitress] Pardon me.

770
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,075
There you go.

771
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:51,874
He'd kill me.

772
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,459
Him and his mother.

773
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:58,672
She couldn't care less if I fell off
the face of the earth, really,

774
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:00,883
but she'd never let me go.

775
01:04:00,966 --> 01:04:02,634
Or Jimmy.

776
01:04:05,095 --> 01:04:07,472
Donnie got away from her once.

777
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:10,142
She's never going to
let that happen again.

778
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:15,647
I don't want Jimmy to grow up like them.

779
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:19,359
[voice breaking]
Don't want him to be like them.

780
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:24,323
[Margaret] Then you know what's right.

781
01:04:26,825 --> 01:04:28,035
Honey.

782
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:32,497
You want us to drive you out there?

783
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:34,041
We can do that.

784
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:35,542
Right now.

785
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:37,586
Right, George?

786
01:04:37,669 --> 01:04:39,004
The three of us, we can get Jimmy,

787
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:41,423
- pack you up, take you back...
- No. No.

788
01:04:46,011 --> 01:04:47,095
I'll meet you.

789
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:52,184
Everybody's usually asleep by midnight.

790
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:57,147
I'll have to wait to be sure.

791
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:00,359
We should come get you, sweetheart.

792
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:03,028
No. This is the way.

793
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:05,489
The safest way, trust me.

794
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:09,368
That's... That's what everyone
wants most, isn't it?

795
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:13,455
For you and Jimmy to be safe. Hmm?

796
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:15,916
And happy.

797
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,670
We're out at the Moon Wink.

798
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,257
- 'Kay.
- Cabin seven at the Moon Wink Motor...

799
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,259
I heard you. I know where it is.

800
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:28,595
I should be there by 2:00.

801
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:32,641
But we have to leave
right when I get there.

802
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:33,892
No waiting.

803
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,356
Okay.

804
01:05:39,439 --> 01:05:41,233
Lorna, wait.

805
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:44,403
Wait. Lorna.

806
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:47,823
I...

807
01:05:49,616 --> 01:05:51,994
I know we haven't always
seen eye to eye, but...

808
01:05:52,077 --> 01:05:54,830
I don't think we've ever seen eye to eye.

809
01:05:56,748 --> 01:05:58,792
Well... we will.

810
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:01,879
You're just saying that
to make sure that I go with you.

811
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:06,592
Jimmy needs his mother.

812
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:11,805
You could've used one too.

813
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:17,603
I could've been that to you.

814
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:20,355
I should've been.

815
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,233
But I wasn't.

816
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:26,653
It's okay.

817
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:29,698
I'm sorry, Lorna.

818
01:06:33,493 --> 01:06:36,371
I should've been... much more to you.

819
01:08:14,845 --> 01:08:17,014
Don't start what you can't finish.

820
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:50,796
Can you...
answer something for me?

821
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:53,008
Okay.

822
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:57,220
That horse of yours, Strawberry.

823
01:08:57,304 --> 01:08:58,971
Strawberry?

824
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,892
[laughs] I loved that horse.

825
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:04,144
What brought that up?

826
01:09:05,312 --> 01:09:06,939
Seeing you ride again.

827
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:08,106
Hmm.

828
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:15,781
Something I always wondered about,
when we had to put her down.

829
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:20,035
You whispered to her. Do you remember?

830
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:21,953
Yeah.

831
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:25,249
Like you were telling secrets.

832
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:26,917
[chuckles softly]

833
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:30,712
What was it you told her?

834
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:39,054
I reminded her of things.

835
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:45,102
How she liked to gallop through
the first snow every year.

836
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:47,395
About the time we raced Ernie Dahlberg

837
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:50,189
and his big chocolate mare
and left them choking in our dust.

838
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:52,067
[chuckling]

839
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:54,653
I reminded her of this one time.

840
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:57,072
I was in high school...
it was some October,

841
01:09:57,155 --> 01:09:59,116
and we were heading home.

842
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,578
And the full moon was just
coming up over Dollar Butte.

843
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:04,872
And she stopped.

844
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:07,416
Stopped and stared.

845
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:09,751
Like she cared about
the moonrise as much as me.

846
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:16,675
And when we put James on her back
for the very first time...

847
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,762
she stood so still.

848
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:25,100
Like she knew she had to take care of him.

849
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:37,988
I wanted to send her on her way
with happy memories.

850
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:45,579
I'm sorry.

851
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:49,249
Sorry? Why?

852
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:51,251
I made you sad. That's...

853
01:10:52,753 --> 01:10:54,338
That's not what I wanted.

854
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:59,092
You didn't make me sad, George.

855
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:03,055
[sniffs]

856
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,311
What I wanted is to tell you...

857
01:11:11,855 --> 01:11:13,941
tell you what sticks with me.

858
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:18,987
Strawberry and you.

859
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:24,451
This woman I married but can't figure.

860
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:29,831
Who doesn't believe
there's any world but this one,

861
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:33,001
but still believes
a horse has got a soul somehow.

862
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:39,800
That's the gal for me.

863
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,455
She did seem quick to come around.

864
01:12:10,539 --> 01:12:11,790
Please.

865
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,501
Don't say anything.

866
01:12:41,069 --> 01:12:43,530
[no audible dialogue]

867
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:15,437
[gunshot echoes]

868
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:18,774
[knocking]

869
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:24,655
[knocking]

870
01:13:42,464 --> 01:13:43,966
Get out.

871
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:47,719
No, you get the hell out now.

872
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:50,305
[Margaret] George!

873
01:13:53,392 --> 01:13:54,643
He let us in.

874
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:58,689
See, you think you can gang up on Lorna.

875
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:02,734
But when it's done to you,
it's a different story.

876
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:03,986
What are you talking about?

877
01:14:04,069 --> 01:14:05,612
[Blanche]
Oh, is that what you're gonna do?

878
01:14:05,696 --> 01:14:08,907
Pretend like you two
didn't jump Lorna at work?

879
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:10,033
Shame on you.

880
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:11,410
Shame on both of you,

881
01:14:11,493 --> 01:14:14,246
badgering and bullying her
to give up her boy.

882
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:17,666
You're lucky Lorna doesn't have
a little mama grizzly in her.

883
01:14:17,749 --> 01:14:19,585
Come between that kind of mama
and her baby,

884
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:23,005
you're fixin' to get your hand bit,
or worse than.

885
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:26,842
Somebody tried to come between
me and one of my boys...

886
01:14:27,759 --> 01:14:31,180
- tried to talk me out of my child...
- That's not what happened.

887
01:14:31,263 --> 01:14:33,557
It's no wonder Lorna don't
want to go with you.

888
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,268
Big bull-hen.

889
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:38,979
Thinking you know
what's best for everybody.

890
01:14:39,062 --> 01:14:40,606
Pecking you to death, no doubt.

891
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,691
I never said she shouldn't marry Donnie.

892
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:44,026
I never said you did.

893
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:50,574
[clanks]

894
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:52,075
He hit the boy.

895
01:14:54,453 --> 01:14:57,664
I saw you, across the street
from the grocery.

896
01:14:57,748 --> 01:14:59,625
[Blanche]
Is that what all this fuss is about?

897
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,461
Grandma, are you gonna tell me
you didn't paddle your own, huh?

898
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:04,046
Not ever?

899
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:06,423
He hit Lorna too.

900
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:13,847
Come here.

901
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:23,106
You hit your wife?

902
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:26,985
[Margaret] I saw him.

903
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:30,697
- How'd he do it?
- With his hand.

904
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:32,074
With... [laughs]

905
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:36,203
Alberta Einstein.
Yeah, I know with his hand.

906
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:37,746
I'm asking how.

907
01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:40,040
Like...

908
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:42,876
Hmm?

909
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,586
Was it like that?

910
01:15:48,048 --> 01:15:50,050
Donnie, how'd you do it? How was it?

911
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:53,846
It was harder.

912
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:55,514
Harder?

913
01:15:58,976 --> 01:16:00,185
Like...

914
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:01,562
[gasps]

915
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:03,105
Goddamn it.

916
01:16:06,024 --> 01:16:07,609
Like that?

917
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:10,737
Like that but harder.

918
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:14,074
Donnie...

919
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:18,370
think you're gonna have to
show us how you done it.

920
01:16:33,635 --> 01:16:34,636
[Margaret gasps]

921
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:39,766
[George] Son of... [grunts]

922
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:42,895
[Margaret] No!

923
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:44,396
George!

924
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,273
[groans]

925
01:16:46,356 --> 01:16:48,734
Oh, no, he's all right, Margaret.
He's fine.

926
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:51,737
[Blanche] Yeah?

927
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:55,991
Maybe you want to try talking
this over again now, huh?

928
01:16:56,074 --> 01:16:58,368
Like reasonable folks.

929
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:00,871
Or maybe you'd prefer getting some sleep,

930
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:04,291
so you can get an early start
back home tomorrow.

931
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:07,294
Or maybe...
maybe you'd like to send him home

932
01:17:07,377 --> 01:17:09,755
while you stay on here for a spell.

933
01:17:09,838 --> 01:17:12,716
I could take you back when you're ready.

934
01:17:13,926 --> 01:17:18,972
Of course, by then,
you might decide you want to stay.

935
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:24,394
[quietly] It's okay.

936
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:27,648
It's okay. Easy, girl. Easy, girl.

937
01:17:27,731 --> 01:17:29,608
- [Margaret whimpers, gasps]
- [hammer cocks]

938
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:33,570
You stop right there.

939
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:39,201
You...

940
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:41,578
you stay away from us.

941
01:17:47,876 --> 01:17:49,628
- [Blanche] Get him! Get the gun!
- [Bill] Get him! Get him!

942
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:50,754
[Blanche] Get him up!

943
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:53,048
- No.
- [grunting]

944
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:01,974
[Margaret] Please.

945
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:21,952
Donnie.

946
01:18:25,163 --> 01:18:27,499
What do you want me to do?

947
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,460
You make sure he can't
pull a gun on us again.

948
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:33,046
- [Margaret] No!
- [men grunting]

949
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,092
- Right here.
- [Margaret] No!

950
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:39,887
No.

951
01:18:41,305 --> 01:18:43,265
- No.
- No!

952
01:18:46,476 --> 01:18:47,853
No!

953
01:18:49,146 --> 01:18:50,731
Go on, Donnie.

954
01:18:50,814 --> 01:18:52,191
Come on.

955
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:02,451
- [sobs] Stop.
- I'm teaching you to teach him, see?

956
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:04,328
Donnie.

957
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:07,581
- Donnie, don't! Donnie. Donnie.
- [George] Donnie.

958
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:10,042
You don't have to do this.

959
01:19:11,752 --> 01:19:13,420
Please, Donnie! Please, Donnie.
Please, Donnie.

960
01:19:13,504 --> 01:19:15,088
- Donnie, don't do it. Don't do it.
- Do it, boy.

961
01:19:15,172 --> 01:19:17,216
- [Bill] Do it, boy.
- [Margaret] Donnie! Don't do it!

962
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:19,551
- Donnie.
- [Margaret] Don't do it!

963
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:27,100
Oh, my God!

964
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:29,937
[sobbing] George. Oh, my God.

965
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,314
George. George.

966
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:35,108
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

967
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:36,985
Well, he won't be shooting for a while.

968
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:53,418
[Blanche]
Maybe you understand my family now.

969
01:19:56,255 --> 01:19:58,090
Safe driving, you two.

970
01:20:02,052 --> 01:20:04,221
[panting] George.

971
01:20:04,304 --> 01:20:06,223
George, George, George.

972
01:20:06,306 --> 01:20:07,808
Oh, my God.

973
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:10,519
What have I done to you? Oh, my God.

974
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:22,155
- [George groans]
- He's gonna need morphine.

975
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,575
[Margaret] It's okay.

976
01:20:25,617 --> 01:20:29,830
- This was an ax, you said?
- [panting] Was a... Was a hatchet.

977
01:20:29,913 --> 01:20:31,498
Police are on their way.

978
01:20:32,916 --> 01:20:35,878
[doctor] Look, I can put you under
or I can numb it up and you stay...

979
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:37,337
Awake, right.

980
01:20:37,421 --> 01:20:38,797
- Awake.
- I'll stay awake.

981
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:40,632
Yeah, you're okay.

982
01:20:40,716 --> 01:20:41,925
Awake.

983
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:43,969
[doctor] Ma'am, you're welcome
to wait outside.

984
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:46,555
What?

985
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:12,039
[knocking]

986
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:30,307
Well...

987
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:33,936
Now, I already been over to the Weboys',
had a chance to hear their side.

988
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:35,729
Their side?

989
01:21:35,812 --> 01:21:37,022
Side of what?

990
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:41,151
Their account is that it's Mr. Blackledge
here who pulled a gun.

991
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:42,986
In self-defense.

992
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:45,322
That your service revolver
Blanche showed me?

993
01:21:46,865 --> 01:21:48,534
I'm sure it is.

994
01:21:48,617 --> 01:21:51,828
- You wore the badge once.
- He wore it over 30 years.

995
01:21:51,912 --> 01:21:53,288
Well...

996
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,250
then you know how the law works.

997
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:58,710
I have... [sniffs]

998
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:01,171
I have a fair idea
I know how it works here.

999
01:22:03,674 --> 01:22:05,634
Blanche explained
that things got a tad rough

1000
01:22:05,717 --> 01:22:07,803
persuading you to set your weapon down.

1001
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:09,179
They chopped his hand off.

1002
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,807
Yeah, well, the way they tell it, you two,

1003
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:15,185
you came here looking to take
a child away from his mother.

1004
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:17,396
First with talk... well, threats...

1005
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:19,439
and then a gun.

1006
01:22:19,523 --> 01:22:21,859
Lorna, the boy's mother, did you see her?

1007
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:23,235
Oh, sure, she was there.

1008
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:25,612
Did you speak with her?
She's terrified of them.

1009
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:28,198
She was married to your son, right?

1010
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,659
Yes.

1011
01:22:30,742 --> 01:22:31,827
Hmm.

1012
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:34,413
And he died, right? He's dead.

1013
01:22:35,247 --> 01:22:36,915
How exactly did that happen?

1014
01:22:39,459 --> 01:22:40,836
Why don't you tell us?

1015
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:45,841
Well, um... an accident, she said.

1016
01:22:46,758 --> 01:22:50,679
You know, was thrown from his horse,
broke his neck, snapped in two.

1017
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:55,350
An accident.

1018
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:58,478
And it's an accident.

1019
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,483
You know, and Blanche...

1020
01:23:03,567 --> 01:23:07,654
she expressed real concern about
how accidents follow your family.

1021
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:12,951
She fears for that little one
she's looking after now.

1022
01:23:14,369 --> 01:23:17,748
How the longer you two stick around,
the chances of something happening to him,

1023
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:20,542
well, those chances,
they just keep creeping up.

1024
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:25,672
I don't even want to contemplate
what a tragedy that would be.

1025
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:30,844
There's nothing smaller in this world
than a kid's casket.

1026
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:35,724
Get out.

1027
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:38,435
Well, the consensus over there
is that you two won't be

1028
01:23:38,519 --> 01:23:39,811
causing any more trouble around here.

1029
01:23:39,895 --> 01:23:43,398
And because you're family, by a way,
the Weboys won't be pressing any charges.

1030
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:46,068
So you're free to go.

1031
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:48,946
But, you know,
if I were giving out advice...

1032
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:50,113
You can save that.

1033
01:23:50,197 --> 01:23:52,658
Well, see, I'm thinking of
your grandson here.

1034
01:23:54,117 --> 01:23:56,119
He's a Weboy now.

1035
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:02,251
It's best you put Gladstone behind you.

1036
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:05,671
Just as quick as you can.

1037
01:24:07,381 --> 01:24:08,882
[objects rattling]

1038
01:24:14,263 --> 01:24:15,347
[groans]

1039
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:21,061
Hey, pull over.

1040
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:25,399
- What's wrong?
- Goddamn it.

1041
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:26,525
Pull over.

1042
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:35,158
[coughing]

1043
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,586
[sniffs, groans]

1044
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:46,962
George.

1045
01:24:47,045 --> 01:24:49,214
Are you all right? Talk to me.

1046
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:52,467
[sighs] I'm fine.

1047
01:24:57,347 --> 01:24:59,183
I needed to pull over is all.

1048
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:00,953
[sighs]

1049
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:03,080
[George] Where in the hell are we?

1050
01:26:03,163 --> 01:26:05,082
[horn honking]

1051
01:26:42,661 --> 01:26:43,996
So what will you do?

1052
01:26:45,372 --> 01:26:46,748
I don't know.

1053
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:50,169
Well, I heard what them Weboys
done to you.

1054
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:54,381
Except I didn't know it was you.

1055
01:26:55,799 --> 01:26:56,884
What did you hear?

1056
01:26:56,967 --> 01:26:59,678
Well, that they chopped
somebody's arm off.

1057
01:27:00,554 --> 01:27:02,347
Who told you that?

1058
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:05,475
My uncle. In Gladstone.

1059
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:08,770
So you have family in town then.

1060
01:27:08,854 --> 01:27:13,233
An uncle and an aunt.
They sell skins for me.

1061
01:27:13,317 --> 01:27:15,068
And other stuff.

1062
01:27:15,152 --> 01:27:17,571
Why do you live
all the way out here then?

1063
01:27:17,654 --> 01:27:19,448
All alone.

1064
01:27:19,531 --> 01:27:21,742
It's not where you're from.

1065
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:27,664
'Cause I ran away from
that school in Bismarck.

1066
01:27:40,886 --> 01:27:44,890
The government agents
came into the house when I was eight.

1067
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:50,437
They took me and put me in their truck.

1068
01:27:53,774 --> 01:27:57,778
You know, I thought I did something wrong
and that my mother didn't want me anymore.

1069
01:28:01,823 --> 01:28:03,909
But then I could see she was crying.

1070
01:28:06,537 --> 01:28:07,996
All the mothers were.

1071
01:28:09,456 --> 01:28:11,083
You were eight?

1072
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,920
They cut my hair off.

1073
01:28:16,505 --> 01:28:18,382
And washed me in kerosene.

1074
01:28:19,132 --> 01:28:20,634
And beat me.

1075
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:24,137
To kill the Indian inside.

1076
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:29,017
I guess they did.

1077
01:28:30,811 --> 01:28:32,563
So when I came home,

1078
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:35,691
I couldn't understand
my grandmother's words anymore.

1079
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:38,235
"I'm Peter now."

1080
01:28:39,278 --> 01:28:40,863
Tried to tell her.

1081
01:28:43,448 --> 01:28:45,200
She couldn't understand me, either.

1082
01:28:50,914 --> 01:28:52,875
If I don't belong anyplace...

1083
01:28:56,795 --> 01:28:58,338
here is fine.

1084
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:03,844
You picked a good spot.

1085
01:29:06,555 --> 01:29:08,432
But it's not good to be alone.

1086
01:29:09,224 --> 01:29:10,976
I'm not alone.

1087
01:29:16,356 --> 01:29:17,858
I'm talking to you.

1088
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,376
I have an idea.

1089
01:29:38,337 --> 01:29:40,005
Yeah.

1090
01:29:40,088 --> 01:29:41,632
That's not a first.

1091
01:29:41,715 --> 01:29:43,967
Let me finish
before you make fun of me.

1092
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:46,803
And if you don't know what to say,
don't say anything.

1093
01:29:46,887 --> 01:29:48,180
[grunts]

1094
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,392
- Let's hear it.
- What if we stayed?

1095
01:29:53,477 --> 01:29:55,103
Here.

1096
01:29:55,187 --> 01:29:58,148
I'm sure Peter would be
glad of the company.

1097
01:29:58,232 --> 01:29:59,816
We could build onto this place.

1098
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:03,654
We could put another room on the kitchen.
Or we could build a place of our own.

1099
01:30:05,197 --> 01:30:08,659
You hold the boards while
I hammer in the nails. That it?

1100
01:30:08,742 --> 01:30:11,203
You said you'd let me finish.

1101
01:30:12,496 --> 01:30:14,790
You're finished now.
You just don't know it.

1102
01:30:15,707 --> 01:30:18,919
You really want us to live out here
in the middle of nowhere with a...

1103
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:21,922
Indian boy and a lost horse?

1104
01:30:22,923 --> 01:30:26,343
Just so you can, what,
drive into town every now and again,

1105
01:30:26,426 --> 01:30:28,262
try and catch a peek at Jimmy?

1106
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:35,394
You'll follow him to school
and hope time untwists a sour mind

1107
01:30:35,477 --> 01:30:39,314
and Blanche Weboy lets you hold him again
for longer than 30 seconds' time?

1108
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:43,026
When they come again...

1109
01:30:43,944 --> 01:30:46,154
hack off another couple pieces...

1110
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:50,033
or they start taking pieces of you,
if there's anything left

1111
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:51,952
once you're done tearing yourself apart?

1112
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:53,453
What then?

1113
01:30:54,454 --> 01:30:57,499
And when they hurt Jimmy?
And they will, just for spite.

1114
01:30:59,042 --> 01:31:00,878
How you gonna feel then?

1115
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:06,008
First time I held him,

1116
01:31:06,967 --> 01:31:10,470
he arranged himself
just right in my arms

1117
01:31:10,554 --> 01:31:12,598
and snug to me.

1118
01:31:12,681 --> 01:31:14,349
And light as can be, like feathers...

1119
01:31:14,433 --> 01:31:16,518
Jesus Christ, Margaret!

1120
01:31:18,562 --> 01:31:21,106
When are you gonna stop
torturing yourself?

1121
01:31:30,657 --> 01:31:31,950
I tried.

1122
01:31:33,744 --> 01:31:35,120
I'm sorry.

1123
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:40,167
I tried, George.

1124
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,252
I know.

1125
01:31:46,924 --> 01:31:49,426
[sobbing] But I couldn't save him.

1126
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:51,303
God help me.

1127
01:31:52,596 --> 01:31:54,848
[sobbing]

1128
01:31:56,141 --> 01:31:57,184
Shh.

1129
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,189
Hey. Shh.

1130
01:32:03,273 --> 01:32:05,609
We lost them both.

1131
01:32:23,502 --> 01:32:24,628
[car door closes]

1132
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:31,176
[car engine starts]

1133
01:32:33,136 --> 01:32:36,265
- [door opens]
- George! George!

1134
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:47,484
[grunts] Even as fast as you are,
I don't think you're gonna catch him.

1135
01:32:47,568 --> 01:32:50,153
If he's going where I think,
he'll have to take the road.

1136
01:32:50,237 --> 01:32:52,948
- You're gonna show me a quicker way.
- I'm gonna...

1137
01:32:53,991 --> 01:32:56,577
- I'm not going.
- You are.

1138
01:34:58,615 --> 01:35:01,785
- [stairs creaking softly]
- [hinge creaking]

1139
01:36:13,565 --> 01:36:15,150
[inhales deeply]

1140
01:36:15,984 --> 01:36:18,403
- [quietly] Settle.
- [panting]

1141
01:36:19,488 --> 01:36:21,031
Be still.

1142
01:36:22,115 --> 01:36:24,326
Wake her up. Wake her.

1143
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,496
- Lorna.
- What?

1144
01:36:28,956 --> 01:36:30,040
[gasps]

1145
01:36:30,123 --> 01:36:32,835
You want to go back to Dalton?
You and Jimmy?

1146
01:36:33,877 --> 01:36:36,129
You have to decide.
Go or stay.

1147
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:39,800
- Lorna, ple... [grunts]
- Not you.

1148
01:36:40,717 --> 01:36:43,053
You don't get to say a goddamn word.

1149
01:36:44,429 --> 01:36:46,640
This is up to her.

1150
01:36:47,599 --> 01:36:49,434
You know what life will be.

1151
01:36:49,518 --> 01:36:50,936
Here or there, you know.

1152
01:36:51,854 --> 01:36:53,647
This isn't something you need to think on.

1153
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:55,190
I'll go.

1154
01:36:58,235 --> 01:37:01,196
You know the car.
It's at the bottom of the drive.

1155
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,447
The keys are in it.

1156
01:37:03,073 --> 01:37:05,659
Drive straight to the sheriff's office
in Bentrock. Ask for Nevelson.

1157
01:37:05,742 --> 01:37:07,703
- Bentrock.
- Sheriff Nevelson.

1158
01:37:08,704 --> 01:37:11,039
- He'll sort this out.
- Jimmy's things.

1159
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:13,333
- I need to get...
- No. Out now.

1160
01:37:25,095 --> 01:37:26,555
But what about you?

1161
01:37:28,348 --> 01:37:29,683
Just go.

1162
01:37:30,434 --> 01:37:31,560
- No...
- Just go.

1163
01:37:31,643 --> 01:37:33,812
Quiet as you can. Take the front door.

1164
01:37:34,813 --> 01:37:36,648
Then you run like hell.

1165
01:37:46,533 --> 01:37:48,785
- [floorboard creaks loudly]
- [Lorna gasps]

1166
01:37:50,412 --> 01:37:51,413
Grandpa.

1167
01:38:09,806 --> 01:38:12,392
Something's burning.
Hey, something's burning! Come on!

1168
01:38:13,852 --> 01:38:15,812
- You leave that stove on?
- Mm-mmm.

1169
01:38:28,367 --> 01:38:29,701
What the hell is going on?

1170
01:38:29,785 --> 01:38:32,746
Bill, the... the house is on fire.

1171
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:35,582
Uh... w-we smelled smoke.

1172
01:38:37,793 --> 01:38:40,128
- Hold on. Hold on.
- No!

1173
01:38:48,428 --> 01:38:49,680
Help!

1174
01:38:50,305 --> 01:38:52,224
- [Lorna] No. No.
- [Bill] Hold on. Hold on.

1175
01:38:52,307 --> 01:38:54,476
- No! Get your hands off of him!
- Don't! Don't!

1176
01:38:57,104 --> 01:38:58,272
[shotgun clicks]

1177
01:39:19,084 --> 01:39:20,085
Jimmy.

1178
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:25,299
Bill, what's going... [screams]

1179
01:39:38,103 --> 01:39:39,438
[Blanche] Bill.

1180
01:39:39,521 --> 01:39:42,149
- Bill, out of the way. I got him.
- God's sake, Blanche, don't shoot!

1181
01:39:53,702 --> 01:39:54,786
Lorna!

1182
01:39:58,707 --> 01:39:59,708
[grunts]

1183
01:40:02,794 --> 01:40:04,880
Give the boy to me, old man!

1184
01:40:09,885 --> 01:40:12,137
No one gets hurt. [panting]

1185
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,402
No.

1186
01:40:31,031 --> 01:40:32,032
Boys!

1187
01:40:35,202 --> 01:40:36,620
House is on fire!

1188
01:40:36,703 --> 01:40:38,830
Get Lorna! She's got the boy!

1189
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:40,832
[screams]

1190
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:43,168
Mama?

1191
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:46,004
[Blanche] Marvin!

1192
01:40:50,592 --> 01:40:52,886
- [gunshot in distance]
- [horse whinnies]

1193
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:54,304
Oh, my God.

1194
01:40:59,643 --> 01:41:01,270
Lorna!

1195
01:41:06,775 --> 01:41:08,777
[panting] Lorna. Jimmy.

1196
01:41:09,444 --> 01:41:10,445
Are you all right?

1197
01:41:12,656 --> 01:41:15,075
Baby. Where's George?

1198
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:17,286
He told me to run, to take the car.

1199
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:19,454
- Stay with her.
- No.

1200
01:41:19,538 --> 01:41:20,914
No, stay, stay.

1201
01:41:22,124 --> 01:41:23,876
Stay with them, Peter!

1202

- [fire crackling]
- [wood creaking]

1203
01:42:02,664 --> 01:42:03,999
George.

01:42:11,965 --> 01:42:13,217
[both grunt]

1205
01:42:16,345 --> 01:42:18,388
Jimmy. Where's Jimmy?

1206
01:42:18,472 --> 01:42:20,724
He's safe, George. With Lorna.

1207
01:42:20,807 --> 01:42:22,309
And Peter. They're waiting for us.

1208
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:26,063
Blanche?

1209
01:42:26,146 --> 01:42:27,606
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

1210
01:42:27,689 --> 01:42:29,233
I don't know. We have to go.

1211
01:42:32,069 --> 01:42:34,238
[gasping, panting]

1212
01:42:34,321 --> 01:42:36,782
Just go. Go. Get out.

1213
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:39,618
Not without you.

1214
01:42:39,701 --> 01:42:41,245
Come on.

1215
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:44,414
Come on. You can lean on me.

1216
01:42:50,671 --> 01:42:51,713
[Peter] Margaret?

1217
01:42:52,464 --> 01:42:53,841
George!

1218
01:42:53,924 --> 01:42:55,175
Peter.

1219
01:42:57,719 --> 01:42:59,638
- Margaret.
- George!

1220

[grunts]

1221
01:43:08,063 --> 01:43:09,398
Why?

1222
01:43:10,107 --> 01:43:11,608
Why?

1223
01:43:12,818 --> 01:43:14,570
You, you go to hell!

1224
01:43:23,453 --> 01:43:25,038
Look at me. Look at me.

1225
01:43:25,122 --> 01:43:28,750
Please look at me. I'm right here.

1229
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:44,474
Come on.

1230

- We have to go now!
- No!

1231

[sighs]

1237
01:46:11,538 --> 01:46:12,664
[quietly] Thank you.

1238
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:15,918
You should go.

1239
01:46:23,217 --> 01:46:24,635
Goodbye.

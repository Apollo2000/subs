1
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,401
I'm Dr. Walt Miner.

2
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,319
I'm here to talk about LSD.

3
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,744
We have never given LSD
to a living creature

4
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,787
that it hasn't affected.

5
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,248
It affects fish, it affects spiders,

6
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,834
it affects rabbits, and dogs, and cats.

7
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:47,630
Perhaps most interesting of all,
for one reason or another,

8
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,758
LSD was given to an elephant once.

9
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,219
And, lo and behold,
it killed the elephant.

10
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,598
Some people have a bad experience
the first time they take the drug.

11
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,560
Others take it 30, 60,
or even a hundred times,

12
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,228
before their bad trip.

13
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,563
And the bad trip?

14
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,190
Instant insanity.

15
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,026
Often a never-never land of no return.

16
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,362
There is nothing, um...
grown-up or sophisticated

17
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,823
in taking an LSD trip at all.

18
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,992
They're just being complete fools.

19
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,953
It is playing Russian roulette.

20
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,508
Drug use in educational films
has always been portrayed

21
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,344
in a somewhat exaggerated
and hysterical way.

22
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,346
Parents panicking,

23
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,391
children having freak-outs,
and people jumping out of windows.

24
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,486
Don't get me wrong,
drugs can be dangerous,

25
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,030
but they can also be hilarious.

26
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,574
Now, what kind of person
would put themselves

27
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,202
through something dangerous and hilarious?

28
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,121
If nothing else,

29
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,374
my hope is that tonight's film
will answer that question.

30
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,125
Enjoy.

31
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,089
I don't think psychedelics are the answer
to the world's problems,

32
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,507
but they could be a start.

33
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,050
All geniuses did it.

34
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,471
Einstein, Steve Jobs,
Jimi Hendrix, A$AP fuckin' Rocky.

35
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,559
And I just always had this question,
"There's gotta be more..."

36
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,938
And then when I took acid, I went,
"Oh, you were right. There's a lot more."

37
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,649
My point of view changed on drugs.

38
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:33,695
We gained a lot of insight
about the way I view reality.

39
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,739
I've easily done over a hundred hits...

40
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,242
easily, and probably closer to two.

41
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,704
- Doesn't eight make you legally insane?
- They say that...

42
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:46,499
I think I've done mushrooms,
like, 12 times...

43
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,294
I probably did mushrooms... 12 times.

44
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,670
Literally 50 times.

45
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,755
I took a lot of acid.

46
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,755
A lot of acid.

47
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,886
I took a lot of acid.
I must've taken around 500 trips.

48
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,845
I took acid once.

49
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,642
Maybe even
didn't need to actually take it.

50
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,853
Probably could've
just watched this documentary.

51
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,521
Is everybody in?

52
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,065
The movie is about to begin.

00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:52,709
Psychotropic drugs fall
under a huge, broad category.

65
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,088
What I experimented with
were hallucinogens.

66
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:03,428
And they put you in a state
of consciousness which is very altered,

67
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,973
where your perception,
your cognition,

68
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,185
your, uh... knowing is very different.

69
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:15,773
Uh... Initially,
it feels like it's not real,

70
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,110
but then when you come out of it,
you wonder what is real.

71
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,408
Um, I wouldn't like this to be an exercise
in the sort of "just say no" campaign,

72
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,494
you know...
...putting people off this experience,

73
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,706
because I think
it's a valuable experience.

74
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,625
And whenever I've had a bad trip,

75
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,419
and I've had many,

76
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:41,466
I always realize that, um...
it was what I needed.

77
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,718
Um...

78
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,511
sometimes it kicks your arse,

79
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,474
and sometimes you need to have
your ego taken down...

80
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,892
a notch or two.

81
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,226
On the other hand,

82
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,480
you can get
immensely rewarding experiences,

83
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,900
full of love and support,

84
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,735
and a sense of buoyancy,

85
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,614
and a sense of... a religious sense
of connection to the planet.

86
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,202
So my feeling is it's, um...
It balances out.

87
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,966
I remember one day, a friend of mine
gave me some dried peyote,

88
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,469
which I'd... I'd never taken before.

89
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,430
I live on a farm down in England.

90
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,724
I took it at 11 a.m.

91
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,019
On the way back to the main house, um...

92
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,647
I started to get this feeling,

93
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,982
and everything was coming alive.

94
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,610
The grass starts talking to me...

95
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,071
Sting!

96
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,700
...and very quickly,
I entered this psychedelic realm.

97
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,162
The trees are waving
kind of musically at me.

98
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,247
Sting!

99
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,541
And I go past the farm,

100
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,961
and I have a guy who runs my farm
called John,

101
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,630
who hails me over very urgently,

102
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,799
"Come on! I need your help!"

103
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,592
I said, "John, I'm, uh...

104
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,886
I'm actually busy."

105
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,556
He says, "No, you've gotta help me."
I said, "Well, what is it?"

106
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,518
He said, "Well, one of the cows
is having a problem birthing,

107
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,687
and I need your help...

108
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,774
...because without your help, she'll die.
She's in a, you know, a bad way."

109
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,486
And as he's speaking,
I'm getting more and more high, and...

110
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,029
and disconcerted.

111
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,073
So I go over to him,

112
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,286
and she's in distress, she's crying,
and she's in a great deal of pain.

113
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,207
What the experience does
is it very clearly

114
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,419
presents you with the idea
of mortality, right here,

115
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,421
and you cannot... You can't dodge it.

116
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:47,341
It's your own mortality,
the mortality of this planet,

117
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,386
the mortality of this little steer
who's being born, and its mother.

118
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,472
So you cannot get around that.

119
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,641
That is the central issue
of consciousness.

120
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,311
One day we will not exist.

121
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,480
How do we...
How do we deal with it?

122
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:06,235
So, we wrap some rope
around the steer's forelegs and snout,

123
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,987
and my job is to pull

124
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,823
while he navigates the operation.

125
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,660
And we're getting covered
in all kinds of amniotic fluid and stuff.

126
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,413
This operation takes about 20 minutes.

127
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,334
It's like pulling in a whale
on a fishing boat.

128
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,377
And I'm getting higher.

129
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,551
And we eventually get the steer out.

130
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,596
His mother breathes a sigh of relief,
and for me,

131
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,307
the entire universe has cracked open.

132
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,059
It was like the meaning of life.

133
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,939
You know, I think
what the psychedelic experience does

134
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,482
is it takes...

135
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,945
the "it" out of "me and it".

136
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,698
It becomes me and thou.

137
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,660
Everything, you know, whether it's a tree,

138
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,204
or it's a river, or it's a piece of rock,

139
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,290
you realize that you are connected.

140
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,710
You know,
you're made up of the same matter.

141
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,505
I think when you treat the world
as just an object,

142
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,215
you tend to treat it badly.

143
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,885
If you see the world as part of you,

144
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,221
then you will treat it better.

145
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,890
You know, it's not something
you want to do every day.

146
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,433
You have to prepare.

147
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,269
You need an intention.

148
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,146
You can say, "Okay,
I'm going to have this experience,

149
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,275
and I'm hoping with this experience,

150
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,151
I will be able to write a song,

151
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,571
or I will write my novel,

152
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,155
or I will make love,

153
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,118
or I will treat my family better,
I'll be a better citizen."

154
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,036
So if you have an objective,

155
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,039
and then you have the experience,
then you'll be rewarded.

156
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,542
If your objective is
to just get fucked up,

157
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,085
then you will get fucked up.

158
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,796
So, my advice is don't do that.

159
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,341
I'll be honest, I don't remember
having a conversation about it,

160
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,927
I don't remember anything
other than he handed it to us,

161
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,888
and we just went "boop,"
put it right in our mouths.

162
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,142
Didn't think one thought about it.

163
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,936
No thought went into it.

164
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,981
Could've been a big life decision.

165
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,951
I was a young comedian...

166
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,162
in New York City.

167
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,665
We used to hang out
at the end of the night,

168
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,376
all the comics would hang out
at this restaurant.

169
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,963
This old hippie-looking white guy
walked in.

170
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:35,468
He had these, like, pretty substantial,
like, white pieces of paper...

171
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,261
"Boop... Boop."

172
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,804
Forty-five minutes later...

173
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,308
"What was that, was that acid we took?
I don't feel anything."

174
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,977
And it's always when you say,
"I don't feel anything,"

175
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,855
it's usually kind of the tipping point.

176
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,108
Do I feel anything?

177
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,070
What <i>is </i>feeling?

178
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,699
What <i>is </i>feeling?
What is feeling anything?

179
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,952
Oh, this is what tripping on acid is like.

180
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,080
And the hot chocolate came,

181
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,667
and the foam or the whipped cream was,
like, breathing,

182
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,919
and it was too alive to drink.

183
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,046
We floated to Washington Square Park

184
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,424
with a gaggle of people
we had never met before.

185
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,302
Semi-homeless, maybe-ish people.

186
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,765
And we found ourselves
feeling each other's faces,

187
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,268
and laughing and crying...

188
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,729
...and realizing huge things.

189
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,315
I remember saying,
"Let's go back to my apartment."

190
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,901
- Ooh, yeah!
- Yeah!

191
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,153
So we just ran.

192
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,241
Aww...

193
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,827
So we get in his car, and he pulls out,

194
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,453
and we get to the red light,

195
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,789
and the red light turns green,

196
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,749
and then yellow, and then red...

197
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,976
...green,

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,337
and then yellow, and then red,
then green, and yellow, and red.

199
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,214
He has forgotten how to drive.

200
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,175
For the life of him, he doesn't know
how he even pulled out.

201
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,593
It was just muscle memory.

202
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,847
And then, he doesn't know what he's doing,
how cars work.

203
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,473
"How does a car work?

204
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,183
We know how cars work?"

205
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,685
Let's don't drive.

206
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,729
Let's let... Let's have a sober buddy.

207
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,522
No driving, that's insane.

208
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,816
You want to be in the passenger seat.

209
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,526
You don't wanna be the driver.

210
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,609
I wanna be driving.

211
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,612
I don't wanna sit there and think,

212
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,866
"That person is seeing
all the things I'm seeing,

213
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,409
I think I'd better drive."

214
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,327
You know when you see those white lines,

215
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,289
if you look way in the distance,
they almost look like they're going up.

216
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,124
I remember sitting there
driving the car,

217
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,376
and my hands are just doing this
by themselves.

218
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,188
It's almost like I could just sit
and look out the window or whatever,

219
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,714
'cause my body was driving the car.

220
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,592
I eventually stopped.
I just completely stopped.

221
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,926
Because it's so steep,

222
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,262
but I'm not falling back.

223
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,016
And I don't know how that's possible,
and then I realize...

224
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,101
I don't have my foot on the gas.

225
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,313
I've just coasted to a stop

226
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,689
on the Hollywood freeway.

227
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,983
The road went whoosh...

228
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,985
and disappeared.

229
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,113
And I saw nothing but total blackness.

230
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,992
And then there was this tiny little skull
at the end of it.

231
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,745
And it came forward,

232
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,414
and in the skull was the road,

233
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,292
and the mouth opened,
and, whomp, I got swallowed.

234
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,170
Don't drive on acid.

235
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,182
<i>Hi, I'm Tommy Roe.</i>

236
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,769
<i>By now it must be obvious to you,
as it is to me,</i>

237
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,313
<i>that LSD is very powerful stuff.</i>

238
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,398
<i>And that's just what it is: stuff.</i>

239
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,617
Acid and mushrooms are the Coke and Pepsi
of hallucinogens,

240
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,954
but there are lots of things
that can make you trip...

241
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,627
But these are just the beginning
of a list of compounds

242
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,338
that can cause the human brain
to experience

243
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,716
altered states of reality
and hallucinations.

244
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,554
I decided I would, um...

245
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,015
be initiated properly into peyote...

246
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,768
So I took a plane down to Mexico City,

247
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,896
and then we went out in a van
to the mountains,

248
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,358
and we met these people who would
initiate me into this peyote cult.

249
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,319
First of all, they cram massive amounts
of peyote into your mouth,

250
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,865
I mean huge amounts, with strychnine,

251
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,826
and you look at this thing,
and go, "This is poison."

252
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,037
And they... keep stuffing it in.

253
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,499
And very quickly, I am very high.

254
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:40,754
You know, I mean, the desert already is
a sort of surreal psychedelic experience.

255
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,215
You just have to look at one
of these gigantic cacti.

256
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,759
You're in a sort of primal alien world.

257
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,177
Sting!

258
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,555
- Sting...
- Ssssting!

259
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,643
And then they blindfolded me
with three other initiates.

260
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,270
When you have your eyes closed,

261
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,023
you're in this three dimensional,
uh... cartoon world.

262
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,359
You know, you're in a kind of space movie.

263
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,821
And we were forced
to climb the sacred mountain,

264
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,116
I've forgotten the name
of the sacred mountain, blindfolded,

265
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,492
high on peyote,

266
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,827
in the midday sun.

267
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:16,749
So, we're stumbling up this mountain,
and it's quite a hike.

268
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,169
Anyway, eventually we get to the top
in the early evening,

269
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,380
and I feel this kind of sprinkling
on my head.

270
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,634
I think, "Oh, they're giving me a shower,"
because we were filthy dirty.

271
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,012
I open my eyes, and it's blood.

272
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,349
And I said, "What is this?"
"Oh, it's deer's blood, it's part of it."

273
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,060
I'm having deer's blood
poured on top of me.

274
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,065
And it was during the time
of Halley's Comet.

275
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:45,319
Halley's Comet is quite something,
especially when you're on peyote,

276
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,072
because it looks like a fiery dragon.

277
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,201
Quite fearsome, and very threatening.

278
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:57,414
But it didn't frighten me as much
as this concept of mortality,

279
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,208
which is a constant with me.

280
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,751
This was something...

281
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,632
difficult and, I think, meaningful.

282
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,481
Drugs are great.

283
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,526
Psychedelics are <i>so</i> cool.

284
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,611
I love hallucinogens.

285
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,530
Give me some, now!

286
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,408
These are just some of the things
you'll hear

287
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,743
on a typical playground these days.

288
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,036
Does that scare you?

289
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,204
It should.

290
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,374
Because today's kids
are increasingly turning on,

291
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,543
tuning in, and dropping out.

292
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:47,214
Now, how do us "squares" wrap our heads
around this terrifying trend?

293
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,300
Well, we watch videos, like this one,

294
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,303
about one little girl,
let's call her Emily,

295
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,472
because that is her name,

296
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,556
and her...

297
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,360
Hey, guys, what's up?

298
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,989
So, Emily, I'm throwing a party tonight,

299
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,450
and it'd be pretty rad if you came by.

300
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,119
No, remember we were gonna go have fun
at your place,

301
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,246
doing safe stuff
under your mom's supervision.

302
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,208
Parents get a bad rap, but...
they're not so bad to hang around with.

303
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,921
C'mon, Emily, it'll be fun.
There'll be tons of hard drugs there.

304
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,883
Okay, maybe I'll see you there.

305
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,969
I mean, how bad could it be?

306
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,313
Who's ready for some hard drugs?

307
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,231
Got some LSD,

308
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,691
some mushrooms,

309
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,778
acid, some blue heaven, purple haze...

310
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,905
I got blue sky on Mars,

311
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,990
I got Grandma's dentures.

312
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,909
I got Pac-Man...

313
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,787
We got Super Marios, we got Luigis,

314
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,123
we got Reagans,
and some orange sunshine...

315
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,334
Oh, I'm in!

316
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,217
Orange sunshine doesn't sound too bad.

317
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,344
It has lots of names, Emily,

318
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:20,224
but it doesn't take being a math nerd
like Maya to know what it equals...

319
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,267
A bad trip.

320
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,148
C'mon, Emily, just try one.

321
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,109
Maybe just one.

322
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,872
- Don't do it, Emily.
- Think about your future, Emily!

323
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,742
I think I'm tripping...

324
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,538
Weird...

325
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,290
That's every acid trip in a movie.

326
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,668
They have never, ever nailed it.

327
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,171
They always, in movies,
will use, like, a fisheye lens.

328
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:55,551
They always pitch the person's voice
way down,

329
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,429
so everything just looks distorted,
you know, and the person's like...

330
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,599
"Hey, man, I'm on acid!

331
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,352
Oh, my God, I can feel my soul!"

332
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,605
The one thing I've seen
in a movie that was pretty close

333
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,607
was in <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.</i>

334
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,278
There's a scene
where Johnny Depp is in the casino,

335
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:18,615
and the floor is, like,
kind of moving around and stuff.

336
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:23,662
Like, when I saw that, I was like,
"Yes. That's acid."

337
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,414
I don't know how much acid you've taken,

338
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,584
but one of the constants
in most of my trips during that period

339
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,628
is things would always happen
while high on acid

340
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,257
that under no ordinary circumstances
would happen.

341
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,885
Strange, and in this case,
terrible things.

342
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,355
Hi, my name's Anthony Bourdain. Um...

343
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,192
I liked LSD a lot.

344
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:57,321
You know, I became a teenager
just as the '60s were ending,

345
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:01,909
and, you know, I was cruelly disappointed
that I'd sort of missed out

346
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,827
on the entire hippie era.

347
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,246
You know,
I'd read about them in <i>Life</i> magazine,

348
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,416
when I was nine and ten years old,
and that looked really good.

349
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,336
I thought, "I can't wait
till I'm old enough to go to San Francisco

350
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,796
and take acid," you know?

351
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,799
People are jumping out of windows
and stuff, it must be interesting.

352
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,135
And, you know,
my parents were horrified by it,

353
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,846
so...
that was something of an endorsement.

354
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:27,684
I know I was fully in the thrall
of the works of Hunter S. Thompson,

355
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,604
And by fully in the thrall, I mean...

356
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,274
we thought Hunter Thompson
was the coolest thing ever,

357
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,985
and we wanted to be just like him.

358
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,529
There's that Thompson image of,
you know,

359
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,907
you know you're having a bad trip
when you look down,

360
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,326
and you see your dead grandmother
with a knife in her teeth

361
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,661
crawling up your leg.

362
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,829
That was funny to us,
and we kind of...

363
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,999
We wanted to, if not experience that,
to survive that.

364
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,170
For this weekend, we prepared ourselves
for an early version of the road trip.

365
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,257
I told my parents that I was staying over
at my friend's house

366
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,967
for a sleepover weekend.

367
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,679
He had use of the car,
and, I think, a learner's permit.

368
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,933
This was the basic framework
around which our master plan coalesced.

369
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,893
First we acquired some drugs.

370
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,355
A lot of acid, some weed,
some Lebanese hash,

371
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,358
Gordon's gin, and two cases
of Maximus super beer.

372
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,402
I don't know why we chose that brand.

373
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,570
Also, and this is important:

374
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,905
some Quaaludes.

375
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,701
And proceeded to take a lot of the drugs,
including the LSD.

376
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,168
We set out for the dark heart
of the Catskills.

377
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,963
So we're driving along,
getting off on the acid,

378
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,048
and we encounter two hitchhikers.

379
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,552
Attractive-looking young women,
they were exotic dancers.

380
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,556
One of them identified herself
by the name Panama Red.

381
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,559
Experienced young women of the world
in search of a ride.

382
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,645
We immediately let it slip as well
that we were fully loaded

383
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,065
with a pretty dizzying array
of controlled substances.

384
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,902
Unsurprisingly enough, this interested
these two young delicate flowers.

385
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,990
We went back to her room.

386
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,909
And we smoke some weed,
we smoke some hash...

387
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,204
Uh-oh, careful, he's gonna attack!

388
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,294
It's not real. Look at this!

389
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,505
Then she reminded us
that we had mentioned Quaaludes.

390
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,175
And I gave her one,

391
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,886
and she seemed to indicate
that this was unsatisfactory,

392
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:26,970
that she would like two.

393
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,347
Two Parest-400's.

394
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,099
Now these motherfuckers
were industrial strength,

395
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,268
powerful fucking Methaqualone.

396
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,562
Panama starts,
with the help of all that liquor,

397
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,940
starts getting pretty high
on that Quaalude as it's hitting in.

398
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,985
We are, by this point, ha...
we're peaking, okay?

399
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,781
That part, things started to go wrong.

400
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,409
Well, things went wrong very quickly.

401
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:54,373
Panama starts modeling her outfits
from her earlier years in Vegas.

402
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,798
Suddenly, Panama, mid-stride,
her eyes roll up in her head,

403
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:07,052
and she keels over,
stone dead on the fucking floor.

404
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,024
She's OD'd, she's dead,

405
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,149
and we've given her the drugs
that have killed her.

406
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:27,030
Already in my mind, the police helicopters
with their searchlights

407
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,491
would be swooping over the motel
at any minute.

408
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:33,370
There will be, you know,
special units with battering rams

409
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,288
coming in the windows and the doors.

410
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,457
What do we do now?

411
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,502
You know, "My parents think
I'm sleeping at your house,"

412
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,004
and we're high. We're really, really high.

413
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,297
On the way over here,

414
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:48,885
you know, the sky is filled with colors
and concentric circles,

415
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,221
and strange and,
you know, wonderful things.

416
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,307
Now, it's ugly and paranoid.

417
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,853
Reality has intruded
in a seriously ugly way.

418
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:02,023
Before we came close to figuring out
what happened,

419
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,526
she stirred and roused herself,

420
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,570
as if nothing had happened.

421
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,823
She stood up as if
she collapses to the floor all the time.

422
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:17,247
We drank a lot of gin,
and snorted coke off the Gideon's Bible.

423
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,767
I remember at one point
excusing myself to go to the bathroom,

424
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,794
and looking in the mirror
and seeing, uh...

425
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:27,007
you know, an Indian chief
in full war-paint in the in the mirror,

426
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,760
looking up and... Looking in a mirror
is never a good idea on acid,

427
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,221
but in this case,
it was a really bad idea.

428
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,349
Don't look in the mirror.
Cover the mirrors.

429
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,685
Not a great idea to look in a mirror.

430
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,646
Oh, my God, looking in the mirror is,
like, the worst.

431
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,274
Like, looking in the mirror,
and who am I, who do I see?

432
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,734
You can see through your skin.

433
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,488
Your skin is apparently more translucent,
uh, when you're tripping.

434
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:54,034
You can see, like, the blood rushing
through your vessels and the veins.

435
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,786
Especially if you have
any self-esteem issues.

436
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,957
You know, it's just like... I mean,
I've had, like, my face turns into a goat.

437
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,543
Doesn't matter what you look like,
cover the mirrors.

438
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,634
Don't look in the mirror!

439
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,762
I'm Dr. Charles Grob, spelled G-R-O-B.

440
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,889
I'm a psychiatrist.

441
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,182
I'm a researcher

442
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:21,186
investigating the potential
for a hallucinogen treatment model

443
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:25,357
to heal psychiatric illness

444
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,150
or heal addiction.

445
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:32,197
I've also conducted an FDA-approved study
where we had permission

446
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,452
to use the alkaloid
of hallucinogenic mushrooms, psilocybin,

447
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,789
in a treatment model
for individuals with advanced stage cancer

448
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,332
who have reactive anxiety.

449
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,961
Overall, their quality of life
improved noticeably.

450
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,754
No one had a bad trip,

451
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:51,299
no one had
a serious physiological reaction.

452
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,886
So, we found that, you know,
at the very least,

453
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,514
there was good potential
in this treatment model,

454
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,559
and worthy
of further controlled investigation.

455
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,689
<i>Let's hear from young people who've had
their reasons for being down on LSD.</i>

456
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,942
<i>Let's also hear from doctors,
psychologists and other experts</i>

457
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,735
<i>who have tried LSD themselves.</i>

458
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:15,198
<i>The only time I think
I've ever been able to understand myself</i>

459
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,449
<i>was on an acid trip.</i>

460
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,618
<i>Then things were really clear.</i>

461
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,746
You know, I didn't have
any one small bad trip.

462
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,000
I had one long pretty good one.

463
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,211
I had outfits that went with acid,

464
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,922
I had the music that went with acid,

465
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,925
uh... makeup that went with acid...

466
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,927
To me, it was a...

467
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,721
a ritual drug.

468
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,514
You wanna look at my house?

469
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,559
Okay, my house is the acid house.

470
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,989
It affected everything.

471
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,961
To me, it's so hilarious
to have, like, drug anecdotes.

472
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,756
The very nature of what you're asking...

473
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,843
If you're doing drugs the right way,
you can't tell an orderly story.

474
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,889
Hi, I'm Carrie Fisher, and...

475
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,725
I took a lot of LSD.

476
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,479
I think I'd heard about acid
maybe from John Belushi.

477
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,439
But I did not have a problem with...

478
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,900
At that point,
I didn't have a problem with drugs.

479
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,194
I had not gotten into the drug zone

480
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:38,281
that would ultimately prove
to be my downfall,

481
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,741
which would be opiates.

482
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,534
You know, it would be hard to get...

483
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,162
What, are you going to get addicted
to acid? You know, no.

484
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,081
And it's a very hard drug to take.

485
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:51,002
So, I would organize trips
around to places in the world

486
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,837
simply to take acid there.

487
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,925
I would do these things,
and forget that...

488
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,844
I looked like someone...

489
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,224
named Princess Leia,
or whatever I was for people, and...

490
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,354
and so it's not a brilliant idea to then,
you know, take acid and go running around.

491
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,564
So, yeah, I went to the Seychelles.

492
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,068
And we took acid, and...

493
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,488
Oh, my God, I was on...

494
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,827
on the beach, and there was
no one else on the beach.

495
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:31,167
And so I'm with my Super 8 movie camera,
that's when this was.

496
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,795
And I'm filming my friend,

497
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:37,090
and as this is going along, suddenly...

498
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,843
I sensed that...

499
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,346
there's been a disturbance in the force.

500
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,015
Don't put that in.

501
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,811
Uh, anyway, and I turn around,
and by the way, I'm...

502
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,315
I can't imagine that I'm nude,
but certainly I'm topless.

503
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,901
And we turn around,

504
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:01,197
and there are a busload
of Japanese folk that have just arrived,

505
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,450
and it turns out where we are,

506
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:08,329
it's where they bring the tourists
to have lunch from all the hotels.

507
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:13,710
I am at that time, I believe,
Princess Leia, in a profound way,

508
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,086
and not...

509
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,754
clothed.

510
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,590
I took acid and went,

511
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,802
"Oh, I see, this makes sense."

512
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:27,056
And in fact,
when I was first, uh, told I was bipolar,

513
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,934
well, I went in to see a doctor,
and I said,

514
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,397
"Well, I felt normal on acid."

515
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:40,278
Why she might feel normal when taking LSD
during the height of her fame,

516
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,907
it may have something to do
with how unnatural it felt

517
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,575
being a public persona,

518
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:49,621
how disconnected
she may have been from herself.

519
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,833
And how the LSD experience
may have allowed her

520
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:58,296
to have accessed some core element,
her core self,

521
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,007
and allowed her to feel more genuine
in that regard.

522
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:05,136
Anyway, what happened was
we took this Owsley acid.

523
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,222
We got <i>really</i> high.

524
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,432
We were in Central Park.

525
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,143
I'm holding onto the ground,

526
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,190
'cause it was hard to stay on the planet.

527
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,487
And I'm watching an acorn,

528
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,032
and it's moving a lot.

529
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,035
I never saw anything that wasn't there.

530
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,747
I just saw things that <i>were </i>there...
misbehave.

531
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:40,839
Holy shit! You're Carrie Fisher!

532
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,758
You're fucking Princess Leia!

533
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,678
Oh, my God, I'm such a huge fan of yours!

534
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,388
And it's misbehaving...

535
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:51,808
Look at this.
I got it at a garage sale. Huh?

536
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,434
Woo!

537
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,602
And misbehaving...

538
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,356
I'm talking to you, 'cause
you're tripping your fucking balls off!

539
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,067
No, just... No, no!

540
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,696
So I had to watch this acorn,

541
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,408
you know, basically choreograph itself.

542
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,535
You're in show business.
Can I run something by you?

543
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,245
Tell me what you think, okay?

544
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,328
<i>♪ I'm a nut ♪</i>

545
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,832
<i>♪ I'm a nut ♪</i>

546
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,002
<i>♪ I'm a nut, nut, nut ♪</i>

547
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,128
<i>♪ I'm nuts ♪</i>

548
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,211
<i>♪ I'm a nut ♪</i>

549
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,090
- What do you think? I'm still, you know...
- Shut up!

550
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,759
Oh... you don't like it.

551
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,261
<i>So at that point,</i>

552
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,890
the acorn was almost back to being itself.

553
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,975
Don't tell anybody what you saw here.

554
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,644
Shh!

555
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,939
Shh...

556
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,107
Don't say nothin'!

557
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,403
<i>As a psychologist,</i>

558
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,573
<i>I have to tell you that the understanding
you think you have gained</i>

559
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,366
<i>just doesn't fit in with the facts.</i>

560
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,619
<i>The only real understanding
you could gain</i>

561
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,496
<i>would come from having a bummer,
and then analyzing it,</i>

562
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,666
<i>which would mean you'd have to want
to try to have bummers,</i>

563
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,585
<i>and then attempt to understand them,</i>

564
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,046
<i>the way that psychologists analyze dreams.</i>

565
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,465
<i>Which, unless you are properly trained,</i>

566
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,258
<i>you cannot do by yourself.</i>

567
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:13,264
Drugs, uh... change your state
of consciousness very dramatically.

568
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,310
So you run the risk of psychosis,

569
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,228
or what's called "a bad trip."

570
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:24,233
A bad trip is minimized
the more you control your set and setting.

571
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,903
A "set" is who's the person
having this experience,

572
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:30,239
their mindset, their vulnerabilities,
their intention.

573
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:34,577
"Setting" is where you're doing it,
how safe is the setting,

574
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,705
Don't take acid with... strangers,

575
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,375
or people who pretend to be your friends,

576
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,584
or friends of friends.

577
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,252
Pick your company well.

578
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,672
Do not ever take LSD with assholes.

579
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,025
You don't want somebody doing,
"Oh, are you freaking out?"

580
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,592
"Oh, you feel it?

581
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,636
Oh, you feel your mind cracking?"

582
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:54,597
So crazy...

583
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,433
"Do you see pink elephants, man?
Do you see pink elephants?"

584
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,811
If you've got a deep sadness or a problem,

585
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,605
that can often be dangerously enhanced.

586
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,109
You don't want a bunch of crazy stuff
going on in your head,

587
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,737
like bad stuff that you're dealing with,
like, "I just broke up with somebody,"

588
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,657
or, "I got caught masturbating
in the coffee machine,"

589
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,326
because that sort of guilt and shame,

590
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,453
you know, just becomes bigger.

591
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,330
You wanna make sure
you're strong mentally.

592
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,542
It's a journey
that everyone must take on their own...

593
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:23,959
with friends.

594
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,796
Hang out with a couple of good friends
in an enclosed space,

595
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,882
not enclosed, with some outdoors,
enjoy the outdoors.

596
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,969
I'd suggest the woods.
That's it, the woods.

597
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,138
Water nearby, a flowing river,

598
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,848
fucking trees, and beauty.

599
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,224
People always say

600
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,977
that you should trip in a meadow
or somewhere natural,

601
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,100
and that's probably great,
but I've never done that.

602
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,856
I've always been in New York City.

603
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,775
The first time I went to New York
and just got high,

604
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,069
I thought the taxis were out to kill me.

605
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,404
Stay away from cities.

606
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,207
<i>And now, back to </i>Bad Trip.

607
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,753
Everyone will tell you
that taking a trip will be fine,

608
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,797
as long as you control
your set and setting.

609
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,632
But the only thing that is sure

610
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,969
is you are set on setting out on a...

611
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,731
"Orange" you glad we're friends?

612
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,359
I don't know, "orange" you?

613
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,113
You guys are acting really weird.

614
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,408
Yeah, guys, knock it off,
it's not funny anymore.

615
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,328
You know what'd be funny?
If I jumped out of a window.

616
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,205
That sounds like a great idea!

617
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,372
Yeah, do it!

618
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,916
Okay!

619
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,667
What? No!

620
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,169
Not the window!

621
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,186
Drugs are a laugh riot...
until they're not.

622
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:13,861
Hi, my name is Nick Kroll,

623
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,490
and I have a cautionary tale to tell
about tripping. Um...

624
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,827
You know, it was super fun,
I just want to caution people.

625
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,338
Couple of years ago,

626
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,799
uh, my friend's bachelor party,

627
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,926
rented a house up in Malibu,

628
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,428
and I procured a bunch of mushrooms for it

629
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,432
because, you know,
dudes in their mid-to-late 30s

630
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,854
are just looking to, you know,
fucking escape.

631
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:52,483
People were smoking salvia,
so you knew it's a classy affair.

632
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,029
We're on some private beach in Malibu.

633
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,823
We all take mushrooms.

634
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,748
I take a few more, just to be, like,
"Yeah, it's cool, these are good."

635
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,038
- Higher!
- Oh! I love my friends!

636
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,772
<i>So we're having a good time.</i>

637
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,917
<i>I'm thinking,
"I'm in the water, I'm tripping,</i>

638
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,962
there's a 90% chance I'm going to drown,

639
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:16,757
but it's feeling good
to be one with the Earth."

640
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,553
We get out of the water, now I'm
on the beach, I'm starting to really roll,

641
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:24,557
and I sit down, and I've eaten
more mushrooms than everybody else.

642
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,936
I see my buddies, and they are starting
to gather a bunch of sea kelp.

643
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,690
I see this, and I'm like,
"I understand what's going to happen now."

644
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,025
Oh, God...

645
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,443
They've come out of the water.

646
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,404
They're emerging
with about 40 to 50 pounds,

647
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,656
and I just see them lift it,

648
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,951
and just put all of this sea kelp
on my body.

649
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,788
And I was...

650
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,415
thrilled.

651
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,251
<i>And the sea kelp starts to move on me,</i>

652
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,170
<i>and I'm like, "I am the kelp monster."</i>

653
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,255
I am the kelp monster!

654
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,431
<i>I couldn't even fathom
wanting to remove...</i>

655
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,477
<i>this fucking detritus from the sea.</i>

656
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,395
Kelp monster!

657
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,314
Uh... The next day I woke up,

658
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,025
uh, covered in red welts,

659
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,904
um, because I had, uh...

660
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,949
been covered in sea fucking kelp

661
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,867
for 45 minutes.

662
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,247
<i>I don't really dig dropping pills,
but you get the wildest trip on acid.</i>

663
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,749
<i>Yeah, but you can also get
the wildest bummers.</i>

664
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:35,378
You know, when there's, like,
four corners or whatever, and...

665
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,547
you kind of get trained by stop lights

666
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,384
or by the walk sign
and the don't walk sign or whatever,

667
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:46,264
and I remember all of a sudden being like,
"Oh, I wanna get over there..."

668
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,349
And instead of going from here...

669
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,851
from point A,
to point B, to point C, I was like,

670
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,771
"I could just go from point A to point C!"

671
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:57,483
And it sounds really stupid,

672
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,193
but it's something acid gave me,

673
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,570
and then in my life I use it all the time,
where I'm like,

674
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:06,242
"If no one's looking,
I can just head straight to point C,

675
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,953
without doing this point B bullshit."

676
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,673
So, I'm Kathleen,

677
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:24,260
and this is Adam, we're married,
we're both musicians. Tell yours.

678
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,846
My story that I wanted to tell...

679
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,472
isn't...

680
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:32,977
I've never had, like, a bad acid trip,
or a bad mushroom trip,

681
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,060
like a freak-out.

682
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:37,523
Late '80s, I was with three friends,
we were driving to...

683
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,568
My friend Money Mark said,
"You gotta go to this place in Baja."

684
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,736
It's me and three women,

685
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,031
and we're just, like,
in the middle of nowhere, in Mexico.

686
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,742
My friend was like,
"Oh, I've got two hits of acid,

687
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,076
we should take 'em."

688
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,746
So we put them in a Snapple bottle,
we all drank it.

689
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,631
And a tire blows.

690
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,968
With me and three women,
and we're in the middle of nowhere.

691
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,780
I don't know how to change a tire,
I don't even know if there was a tire.

692
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,806
You know, as I'm saying it,
I don't even know...

693
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,142
I can't believe
he didn't know how to change a tire!

694
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,770
I don't even know if we looked to see
if there was another tire.

695
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:21,525
As we're like, "This is really grim..."

696
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,404
a white owl flies right above us...

697
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,365
...and we're like, "It's a sign.

698
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,533
Something great's about to happen!"

699
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,787
These two vans filled with dudes,

700
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,996
like, grown men,

701
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,374
pull up, and we're like,
"Oh, this is great!

702
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,125
Oh shit, this is a little weird."

703
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,462
All these guys come out, and they're kinda
walking around the car checking us out.

704
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,130
There are three hot girls in the car.

705
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,840
If I go with them,

706
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,468
they'll take me to a place...
to a guy who has tires.

707
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,097
And so I'm like, "Look, I don't know
if I'm coming back, you guys."

708
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,474
So we do the four-way hug, and we're like,

709
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,309
you know, "Good luck."

710
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,647
And so we drive, and we drive, and we take
a turn further into the mountains.

711
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,649
It's like it's right out of a movie.

712
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,860
And there's all these old dudes
sitting around by a campfire.

713
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,114
And there's these two cinder block shacks,

714
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,533
and I'm like, "Over there?"

715
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,581
Out of the shack comes
the biggest person you've ever seen.

716
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,625
Overalls, no shirt,

717
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,793
he's backlit,

718
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:24,088
with the biggest fucking hammer
you've ever seen in your life.

719
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,424
The more I was freaking out,
the more they were laughing.

720
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,593
He turns over
and then he starts banging on the door.

721
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,014
He opens the door, I'm like...

722
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,183
"Alright, this is it. This is...

723
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:40,604
I try to fight everybody here
to get out, or I see what's in the room."

724
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:46,110
Turns the light on,
it's filled with fucking tires.

725
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,403
It's filled with tires!

726
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:48,946
It's a church group.

727
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,615
The two vans are from a church group.

728
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,952
And they led us on our way,
they told us, "Go back down this way..."

729
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,912
Wow. It all worked out fine.

730
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,080
It was the owl.

731
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,005
<i>This is your brain.</i>

732
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,798
<i>This is your brain.</i>

733
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,216
<i>This is your brain.</i>

734
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,926
<i>This is your brain.</i>

735
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,888
This is your brain on drugs.

736
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,938
This is your brain on my sandwich.

737
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,194
Delicious.

738
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,655
<i>Always that same LSD story,
you've all seen it.</i>

739
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,617
<i>"Young man on acid, thought he could fly,
jumped out of a building.</i>

740
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,035
<i>What a tragedy."</i>

741
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,914
<i>What a dick! Fuck him. He's an idiot.</i>

742
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,958
<i>If he thought he could fly,
why didn't he take off from the ground?</i>

743
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,462
There isn't a lot of stories
of people leaping.

744
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,088
You know, that was the thing.

745
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,716
It was a lot of shit
that was coming down the pipe

746
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,845
when we were originally taking it,
you know, to kinda scare us off.

747
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,805
Both my parents were therapists,

748
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,934
and they worked
in this, uh, psychiatric hospital.

749
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,312
And I guess the way
my parents telling me not to do drugs

750
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,773
was by coming home and telling me

751
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,400
how messed up the kids were
at the hospital

752
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,902
who did drugs only once.

753
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,028
My mom'd be like,

754
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,198
"This kid smoked marijuana,
and it was laced with PCP,

755
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,825
and now he's insane,
he doesn't know what to do.

756
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,245
He puts a fist up his butt,
that's all he does."

757
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,081
That was literally a story my mom told me.

758
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:27,211
So I had the fear of God in me
about doing any sort of drugs whatsoever.

759
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,756
I never did it. That is
until I went to Amsterdam.

760
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,892
Hey, I'm Paul Scheer.

761
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:46,313
And this is my story
about getting ridiculously high.

762
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,067
I went to Amsterdam with a bunch
of my comedy friends to do some shows.

763
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,362
And it was like, "Wow, Amsterdam,
like, marijuana's legal...

764
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,525
Wow! You can even do mushrooms.
This will be amazing.

765
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,117
Alright, we have to have a mushroom day."

766
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,661
And we finally went to a shop,
and, you know,

767
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:04,290
they bring them out like you would
bring out diamonds at Tiffany's.

768
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,001
They have different types
of mushrooms,

769
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,210
and we pick them...

770
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,255
I remember I picked something
that was like "Hawaiian-something."

771
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,424
I was like, "Hawaii, that's cool, yeah,
like surfing.

772
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,787
That's the kind of trip I want."

773
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,636
So we decided
where's the best place to do it

774
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,431
and it would have to be
the Van Gogh Museum.

775
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,683
So, we go into the Van Gogh Museum,

776
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,185
and, you know,
we're just eating these mushrooms...

777
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,855
They say, "Don't eat the whole thing
all at once, right?" "Fine."

778
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,483
So I'm eating these mushrooms.
And about five minutes pass, I'm like...

779
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,154
"Pfft... I don't feel anything.
These mushrooms don't work at all."

780
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,576
Well...

781
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,329
I'm Paul Scheer, in Amsterdam,

782
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,248
and I guess these mushrooms
aren't kicking in.

783
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,585
And so I just eat more of them,
and then more of them.

784
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,129
I guess I'll just enjoy the art.

785
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,756
I'm Paul Scheer in Amsterdam.

786
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,050
I look up at one of the paintings,

787
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,345
which is the crows over the cornfield,

788
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,597
and it really, like, grabs me,
for some reason.

789
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,558
"Wow, this is really interesting.
Oh, look at that!

790
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,268
I can see under the crows!"

791
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,561
I start to turn...

792
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,022
Because I'm convincing myself
that if I turn,

793
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,067
I'm seeing parts of the painting
that don't really exist.

794
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,944
Holy shit!

795
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,488
Look at all this corn!

796
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,450
All of a sudden, I feel like these birds
are coming out at me,

797
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,493
- and I'm in the middle of this cornfield.
- Whoa!

798
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,454
What the fuck?

799
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,414
Now, this is a popular museum.

800
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,291
Family, people are all there...

801
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:33,253
and I'm standing maybe four inches away
from the painting,

802
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,673
almost upside down.

803
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,092
Like this, like, "Yes, yes, yes..."

804
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:45,057
And it's morphing and moving,
I'm like, "Van Gogh, genius!"

805
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,767
I get Van Gogh!

806
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,477
I get Van Gogh!

807
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,106
Now I'm feeling a little bit too hot,
I'm like, "It's hot in here, I'm sweating,

808
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,399
I gotta leave this museum."

809
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,068
I arrive back at the house
that we're staying.

810
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,277
And I go, "Guys...

811
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,322
we need to get McDonald's."

812
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,782
And everyone's like, "Yes!"

813
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,705
I think my plan stemmed from the fact
that we were in a foreign country,

814
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,496
and we needed to ground ourselves
with something American.

815
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,206
So McDonald's was the way to go.

816
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,624
And I go into McDonalds,

817
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,001
they fill up a sack of burgers for me,

818
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,837
I take it back to our house,

819
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,965
and I toss them out to everybody,
everyone starts eating the burgers,

820
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,009
and just like in<i> Alice in Wonderland</i>
when she eats the pill,

821
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,428
we all finish our burgers,

822
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,556
and it just wears off,
we're back to normal.

823
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:29,017
And I was like, "Thank you, McDonald's.
You saved us."

824
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,104
Never had experience in McDonald's,
because I'm not a fucking idiot.

825
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,022
If there's anything antithetical

826
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,608
to a trip on LSD, it's a McDonald's.

827
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,527
Talk about yin and fuck-yang.

828
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,489
You walk in there, and you realize,
"I'm in the belly of the fucking beast.

829
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,243
I have a soul,
and I'm in a soulless cage."

830
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,547
Hi, I'm Rob Corddry.

831
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,215
A psychonaut.

832
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,551
Screen Actors Guild.

833
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,219
Once we were on mushrooms,

834
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,929
and I sat in front of the mirror,

835
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,264
tripping my balls off,

836
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,515
high as a kite,

837
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,143
just, like, staring at myself
in the mirror.

838
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,438
I had my shirt off,

839
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,191
which is usually something that bugs me,

840
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:21,361
but at this point, like,
you don't have any body dysmorphia.

841
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,198
You see things
for the way they really are.

842
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:27,493
No matter how much
they sort of, like, shimmer and breathe.

843
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,286
Your body's breathing anyway.

844
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,997
And I'm, like, looking at it,
my body, and my face,

845
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,292
for what it really, truly is.

846
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,045
It... You know,
my face looked completely different.

847
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,173
My body, I understood it was a shell,

848
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,884
And I felt inside me, the real me,
not in the mirror,

849
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,262
I felt bigger than my body,
and I felt wider.

850
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,889
And I felt, like, "This is it."

851
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,475
Like, "We're part of everything,
everything is connected."

852
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,143
And then I'd look in the mirror,

853
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:57,773
and I'd be like... I could see,
it seemed, like...

854
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,109
the whole world was me.

855
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,947
I could see everything,
everything was connected. All good.

856
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,407
People always say
don't look in the mirror when you're high,

857
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,618
but I'm like, "Don't ever <i>leave </i>a mirror!"

858
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,500
Do look in the mirror!

859
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,002
I remember looking in the mirror.

860
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,213
My face turned into a gargoyle.

861
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,049
That shit was trippy.
I was like, "Oh, shit."

862
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,392
Growing up in an urban community,

863
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,854
like the hood or some shit like that,
we look at acid, like,

864
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:42,901
"Man, that's like crack, or like PCP,
angel dust, meth or some shit like that.

865
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,611
The fuck you do with acid?"

866
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,780
And then as you get older, you know,

867
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,242
you start doing mushrooms
and shit like that, and you realize that

868
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,245
all it is
is, like, fungus and mold, and, you know,

869
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:56,540
this is just, like, some chill shit.

870
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:11,513
I remember the first time I did acid.
It was a couple of years back.

871
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,931
I felt I was ready,

872
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,309
ready to become one with the planet,

873
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,935
the universe.

874
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,688
It was crazy.
It was with a beautiful female.

875
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,149
She's the one who introduced me to it.

876
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:26,361
All I remember is
she had it on, like, crackers already.

877
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,197
Unfortunately, by the time I got with her

878
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:32,951
is exactly when the acid
just started kicking in.

879
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:36,163
And, you know, we gettin' jiggy
and whatnot, right?

880
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,664
It feels so good.

881
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,626
Like, it's...
Everything feels intensified.

882
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,461
I'm seeing all type of shit.

883
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,296
I'm feeling all type of shit.

884
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,423
Colors are moving. I hear colors.

885
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,841
I can taste the colors.

886
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,637
Like, what the fuck
does a color taste like, you know?

887
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,972
And for some reason,

888
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,266
everything she did to me just felt...

889
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,434
amazing.

890
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,019
Like, times two.

891
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,354
Out of the ordinary.

892
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,023
And, uh... This is a bit graphic,

893
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:07,778
it's a bit vulgar, it's a bit raunchy,
you feel me?

894
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,529
You feel me, but...

895
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,406
What can I say? It's life.

896
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:12,866
No lie...

897
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,494
A rainbow shot out of my dick.

898
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:20,207
And it had a sound with it,
like a piano or some shit like that.

899
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,711
I have no idea why there was a rainbow...

900
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,672
coming out of my penis.

901
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,007
I don't even like rainbows.

902
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,761
And I woke up the next day and I told...

903
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,556
I told the homie, and I said, "Yo,

904
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,018
I know what the answer to life is."

905
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,646
And I said...

906
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,898
"It's to love each other."

907
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:45,982
He was like...

908
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,902
"Word."

909
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,489
That was my first time doing acid, man.

910
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,242
But to each his own, because...

911
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,537
I'm not a psychedelic advocate. Like...

912
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,831
you know, I have a good time with it.

913
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,000
It's not for everybody, let me say that.

914
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,253
You know, I'm an artiste,
it's my lifestyle.

915
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,256
I'm on a, like, psychedelic, like,

916
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,760
1960s rock, like, you know, like...

917
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,470
The Castaways...

918
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,180
Jefferson Airplane...

919
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,517
The Rolling Stones had some shit,
fucking Beatles, of course.

920
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,518
Jimi...

921
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,479
Who sings the "Hurdy Gurdy Man,"
is that Donovan?

922
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,859
A truly 1960s experience

923
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:33,697
was, "Is there an answer
to the suffering of the world?"

924
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,451
Because until 1966 in October,

925
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,619
LSD was actually legal,

926
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:44,499
and was used in extraordinary,
beneficial ways, as we all know.

927
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,127
We know now, from documentation,

928
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,004
how it helped so many people.

929
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,881
Anxiety drops.

930
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:54,801
People who are about to die,
who get DMT, you know the story...

931
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,888
They are given some psilocybin,

932
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,724
and suddenly their anxiety disappears,

933
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,392
because they now feel,

934
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,560
"This is natural."

935
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,854
Never did ayahuasca or DMT.

936
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:08,065
I'm too scared, man.

937
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:11,109
You know, I admit it,
but maybe I'll get to the point one day

938
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,652
when I feel brave enough to do it.

939
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,989
DMT is, like, you know,
that is the express ticket

940
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,200
to, you know, the primordial ooze.

941
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:21,203
If you wanna see what it is like
to be just an organic being,

942
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,581
absolutely watch your ego
dissipate into nothingness,

943
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,501
smoke some DMT, and you'll get there.

944
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,384
You'll get there right away,
and you will have

945
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:32,672
direct contact with aliens, and colors,

946
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,510
and ancient patterns,
and sacred geometry, and...

947
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,469
it's amazing.

948
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,514
My name is Zach Leary,

949
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,642
and I grew up with Timothy Leary.

950
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:49,731
He was an American philosopher
and psychologist of the late 20th century.

951
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,401
The first time that my dad
did psilocybin in Mexico, you know,

952
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,654
his famous quote from the experience was,

953
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,823
"I learned more in my four hours
on mushrooms

954
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,367
than I did in my previous
20 years of psychology."

955
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:04,371
<i>Naturally, the psychologists
and psychiatrists want to use LSD</i>

956
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,831
<i>in treating mental illness.</i>

957
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:09,918
<i>I think that LSD will be
the number one, uh...</i>

958
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,586
<i>cure for mental illness</i>

959
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,297
<i>when the psychologists know
how to use it.</i>

960
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,633
And in 1963, he was...

961
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:21,054
fired quite ceremoniously
from Harvard University,

962
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:25,559
for conducting psychedelic experiments
with grad students.

963
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:29,521
Timothy Leary, and Ram Dass,
and, you know, um...

964
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,399
Terence McKenna,
and all these people who...

965
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,485
have spent their lives
exploring those realms,

966
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:40,824
and then, they had also the knowledge
and the genius to be able to study them,

967
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,117
were just shut down.

968
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,411
And so, we fucking blew it.

969
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:48,456
Well, I think it was a shame
that the prior...

970
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,793
generation of psychedelic investigators

971
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,421
were abruptly stopped in their tracks,

972
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:59,551
because they were
onto some very important discoveries.

973
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,554
And they were developing
new treatment models,

974
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,807
which we feel today
should still be explored,

975
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:11,229
because they might offer
a great deal of promise and hope

976
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,774
for people who have suffered
from conditions

977
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:18,612
for which mainstream psychiatry
may not have much to offer.

978
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:22,490
<i>There are many basic questions about LSD
which remain unanswered.</i>

979
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,076
<i>There's much work to be done.</i>

980
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,580
<i>A good deal of important research lies
in the future.</i>

981
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,291
<i>Hopefully, someday we'll have the answers.</i>

982
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,168
People always ask...

983
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:38,632
what my best experiences were
taking psychedelics with my dad.

984
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,027
I mean, we had some good ones,
like Grateful Dead concerts.

985
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,011
Yeah, the visuals were really, like...

986
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:48,433
Gosh, I remember Jerry Garcia's head
sort of swelling to ten times the size...

987
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:51,561
Going to a Grateful Dead show
without drugs was okay.

988
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,025
But with drugs, it was pretty good.

989
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,446
Grateful Dead shows.

990
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:05,158
The greatest place to trip,
because it was very safe.

991
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,078
There are facilities,

992
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,122
um... and kind of makeshift areas,

993
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,791
just for people who are tripping.

994
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,876
As much as I didn't care for the music,

995
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,003
I've probably seen the Dead...

996
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,756
I mean, yeah, I gotta say,
like 11 or 12 times.

997
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,549
I liked Jerry Garcia.

998
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,885
I can admit that publicly,
I'm not ashamed of that.

999
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:27,597
I appreciate the Grateful Dead.
I mean, I went to college, I'm white...

1000
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,392
I went on stage with the Grateful Dead,

1001
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:34,437
and fell asleep
in front of one of the speakers.

1002
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:42,862
This is how you spot a guy at a concert
having a good trip, this is how they walk,

1003
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,242
because they're leading with their head,
they're like... "Meeting life head on!"

1004
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:53,498
But this is how you spot a guy tripping
that's having a bad trip:

1005
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,959
He's leading with his knees, he's like...

1006
00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,296
He wants the knees,

1007
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:03,300
he wants everything but the head
to meet the bad, bad shit head-on.

1008
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,094
One time, uh...
I had figured the wrong amount,

1009
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,973
and I had taken so much
that I looked over at Mickey and said,

1010
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,326
"I can't finish the set,
I gotta go to the dressing room."

1011
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,352
My cymbals were melting, and...

1012
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,355
You know, you can take too much,
and that's a mistake.

1013
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:21,985
I came home, and I was still real high.
You don't come down instantly, of course.

1014
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:27,073
And I sat down politely
at my parents' dining room table,

1015
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,237
and Mama's... It was breakfast,
sun had just come up,

1016
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,952
and she was serving breakfast, of course,

1017
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,039
and served me a plate of eggs
that looked like they were doing

1018
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,124
some kind of new modern dance
on the stage,

1019
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,710
some of this new gyration stuff
going on...

1020
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,588
Everything's moving around,
the sausages were dancing,

1021
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,715
making little buildings and things,

1022
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,884
"How's breakfast, Billy?"
"Fine..."

1023
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,261
I couldn't eat it.

1024
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,140
<i>And now, back to </i>Bad Trip.

1025
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:59,606
Do you like things happening to you
that you wouldn't like happening to you?

1026
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,899
Of course you don't.

1027
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:05,070
Well, that's exactly what will happen
when you go to a drug party.

1028
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,406
Because at every drug party,
there is a prankster.

1029
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:13,620
His mission: to get you high,
whether you want to be or not.

1030
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,704
His scheme:

1031
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,539
the dose.

1032
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,007
- Guys.
- Come on!

1033
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,217
Orange soda!

1034
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,135
- Take a sip!
- Drink it!

1035
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,595
- Drink it.
- Take a sip.

1036
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:35,058
Well, if they're not going to enjoy
these fresh sodas, I am.

1037
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,726
Yeah. Me too.

1038
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,570
Whoa, why is everything
like an electric rainbow?

1039
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:51,116
Yeah! I can see the whole universe.

1040
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,700
It sounds like you guys are tripping.

1041
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,078
No... We didn't take any drugs.

1042
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:57,622
That's not something I would ever do. Oh!

1043
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,582
Did you see that dragon?

1044
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,001
Are you sure you're not tripping?

1045
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,962
I'm sure they <i>are </i>tripping...

1046
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,922
because they've been dosed!

1047
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,967
I put ten tabs of LSD in their sodas.

1048
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:12,971
I never wanted this!

1049
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,931
I'll never be the same!

1050
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,648
I feel it's really wrong to dose anybody,

1051
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,818
because
you're taking over their psychology.

1052
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:30,113
You're responsible
for how they're going to be for 12 hours,

1053
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:33,783
and if they haven't taken acid before,
you don't really have a right to do that.

1054
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,996
<i>When we took
the notorious wonder drug LSD,</i>

1055
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,541
<i>we were having dinner with our dentist.</i>

1056
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,795
<i>And he put it in our coffee,
and never told us.</i>

1057
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,547
<i>And we'd never heard of it.</i>

1058
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:51,676
<i>I mean, it's a good job we hadn't,
because there's been so much paranoia,</i>

1059
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:55,430
<i>uh... created around the drug
that people now, if they take it,</i>

1060
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,891
<i>they're already on a bad trip
before they start.</i>

1061
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,977
When the realization came
that I was on acid...

1062
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,772
bad trip, like a dark tunnel.
I just shut down.

1063
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,870
Hi, I'm Rosie Perez,
AKA Puerto Rican icon. Holla!

1064
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,707
It was New Year's Eve in the late '80s.

1065
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,375
One of my sisters and I,

1066
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:28,796
we were going to an after-hours club
in Alphabet City.

1067
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:32,509
They never sold alcohol
or anything at this club.

1068
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:36,054
It was all like, you know,
"We're all into the music and dance,

1069
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:38,389
and we're into our bodies, and health,
and whatever,"

1070
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,726
so they would only have punch there,
or fruit.

1071
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,145
So we get to the bar,
we see the bartender,

1072
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,064
and he's like, "Oh, what's up, girls?

1073
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,149
You wanna get hooked up?"
We're like, "Yeah, sure!"

1074
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,985
And he goes, "Yeah?"
I was like, "Yeah, alright."

1075
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,987
So, he gives us this punch.

1076
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,657
And we drink it down,
and we start dancing,

1077
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,992
sweating, go back...

1078
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,661
"Can we have another punch?"

1079
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:00,870
He's like, "For real?"

1080
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,915
I was like, "Yeah, it's really good!"
He goes, "Alright..."

1081
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,083
We drink another glass.

1082
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,584
All of a sudden...

1083
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:10,338
the entire nightclub started to expand.

1084
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:13,216
The floorboards...
The wooden floorboards

1085
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:17,428
were waving as if they were
water on the high seas,

1086
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,888
and I'm looking at it,

1087
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:22,475
going, "This is beautiful... Oh, my gosh!"

1088
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,893
So I went on my back,

1089
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,437
and I started doing the backstroke
on the floorboards,

1090
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,940
because they were waves, of course, right?

1091
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,859
And everything's just beautiful,
and everybody's watching me,

1092
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,736
and I'm just, like, in my glory,

1093
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,905
and then all of a sudden
my sister Sally walks over

1094
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,116
and goes, "Your tits are out."
And I went, "Oh..."

1095
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:42,579
And I looked down,
and I was like, "Oh, my God!

1096
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,913
They look gorgeous!"

1097
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,000
And they looked beautiful,

1098
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,253
and I was in awe of their beauty
and their size.

1099
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,380
But then I started looking around,

1100
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,091
and I thought everybody
was looking at me, right?

1101
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,467
And I got real paranoid.

1102
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,929
So I kept trying to cover them up,
because I couldn't find my top,

1103
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,724
because my top was floating
in the wood water, right?

1104
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,684
So I'm covering my breasts like this,

1105
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:08,938
and my titty fat kept squeezing
between my fingers.

1106
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,565
Right? And so it was just like...

1107
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,613
My sister comes over,
and she starts cracking up.

1108
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,740
She goes,
"Come on, we gotta get out of here!"

1109
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,908
We get to the house, get upstairs,

1110
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,578
and when I laid into the bed,
I became the bed.

1111
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,204
My body was the bed.

1112
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:29,500
And I'm trying to flip myself over,
like, my body, that's the mattress,

1113
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,628
and I'm waddling down the hallway,

1114
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,756
still didn't occur to me
that I was high on acid.

1115
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:37,383
And I slid,

1116
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,178
and I'm thinking that the hallway
has now become a slide,

1117
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:43,806
and I'm sliding down the hallway,
all the way down.

1118
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,559
I went, "I'm a bed...!"

1119
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:50,063
And I slid, and I...

1120
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,775
busted my ankle on the porcelain bathtub.

1121
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:56,361
Then I thought my foot was
this humongous thing,

1122
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,446
and it just kept growing, and growing,
and growing.

1123
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,448
I look up, and my boyfriend,

1124
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:03,534
he tells me, "You're high on acid."

1125
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:10,541
My first thought wasn't,
"Oh, my God, I'm high on acid."

1126
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,669
My first thought was, "Oh, my God,

1127
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,463
I hope God doesn't punish me
because I'm high on acid."

1128
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,717
Because I just thought, you know,
"He has... I'm going to hell.

1129
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,386
I'm going straight to hell."

1130
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,389
Prior to this, I didn't drink,

1131
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,598
I didn't smoke weed,

1132
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,100
I didn't smoke cigarettes...

1133
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,769
I did nothing. My high was dancing.

1134
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,733
When you go to a nightclub
and someone offers you a free drink,

1135
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,610
ask what the fuck is in it.

1136
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:40,737
Yeah.

1137
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:43,158
The other part of it that I got from it

1138
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,536
is that I really,
really needed to seek therapy

1139
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:49,539
in regards to my Catholic upbringing.

1140
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:53,501
God forbid, I never want to be burdened
with that much guilt

1141
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,002
ever again in my life.

1142
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,170
So, you know what?

1143
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,257
I guess being on acid
did kinda do me good.

1144
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:03,928
<i>The mental effects of this material
are tremendously variable.</i>

1145
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,472
<i>They are completely unpredictable.</i>

1146
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,393
<i>You cannot tell for any given individual</i>

1147
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,229
<i>if he's going to have a good trip
or a bad trip.</i>

1148
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,608
I don't think they've been able
to identify the foci in the brain

1149
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,736
that might be responsible for a bad trip.

1150
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:24,157
But internally what's going on
is a sense of disorientation,

1151
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,283
confusion,

1152
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:29,120
a sense of being overwhelmed by stimuli,

1153
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:33,458
high levels of anxiety,
even bordering or going into paranoia.

1154
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,836
I've done a lot of acid,
I've done shrooms, I've done speed...

1155
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,212
I don't know what this was...

1156
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,881
It was very speedy...

1157
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,174
- very speedy...
- Oh, yeah!

1158
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,342
...but you also hallucinated.

1159
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,596
- It turned the world around you...
- Yeah.

1160
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:49,432
- ...into an opera of your nightmares.
- Yeah.

1161
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,934
Everything in my brain just switched,

1162
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,979
and everything went drastically downhill,
like...

1163
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,898
at an incredible rate.

1164
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,626
Things would turn into glass and crystal,
and then they would break,

1165
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:02,528
then form back up in front of your eyes,
and then break again.

1166
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,739
My legs started to go numb.

1167
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:08,785
I started to feel my heart beat
in my chest, really quickly,

1168
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,662
and it felt like it was going to pound
through my rib cage.

1169
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,957
I didn't want to say anything to my wife,

1170
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:20,171
because I didn't want her to affirm
how strong this was,

1171
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:22,673
and then my paranoia would increase
even more,

1172
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,092
making the nightmare
that much more intense.

1173
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,762
I saw violence, I saw bloodshed,

1174
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,223
I saw warfare, I saw terrorism,

1175
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,642
I saw beheadings,

1176
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,268
I saw hell.

1177
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,230
At one point, I remember looking out
the window of the car,

1178
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:40,233
and there was a little girl
in the backseat of the car next to us,

1179
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,819
like, looking at me,
like, really intensely.

1180
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:46,781
This little girl can save me.
This little girl can get help.

1181
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,908
She can get me out of this situation

1182
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,868
She was a child. She was innocent.

1183
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,663
I remember trying to communicate
to her with my eyes,

1184
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:57,834
like I was a hostage, like,
"Get me outta here."

1185
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:01,754
I didn't want to talk, 'cause I didn't
want my friend to hear me and kill me.

1186
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,800
And so I was like...
I can see there's a glimmer of hope.

1187
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,095
Finally, the little girl,
like, flips me off,

1188
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:12,056
and then in my head, I'm like,
"I think everybody is in on this.

1189
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:14,392
Everybody is trying to kill me!"

1190
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,185
<i>Some people...</i>

1191
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,939
<i>will reach the peak
of these mental effects right here,</i>

1192
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,774
<i>and they will stay there.</i>

1193
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:27,113
<i>From here on out,
these people are insane.</i>

1194
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,282
Uh... I'm Lewis Black.

1195
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,785
And I'm still Lewis Black.

1196
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,454
That's all I need to say
is "I'm Lewis Black," right?

1197
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:47,717
I did acid when I was about 20.

1198
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,804
I took it in an apartment,
in a place called Hyattsville, Maryland.

1199
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,974
When you reach this point, you're gone,

1200
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,978
and the point I got to was
that I couldn't remember my name.

1201
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:04,066
And it's...
I can't remember my name at all.

1202
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:09,655
One of the things that is a linchpin
between you and those around you

1203
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,032
is your fucking name.

1204
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,742
It's kind of really important.

1205
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,952
The shortest distance between two points

1206
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,872
is for me to just turn to one of them
and say, "What's my name?"

1207
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:20,875
But you can't,
in the middle of an acid trip,

1208
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:24,462
turn to your friends
and ask them what your name is.

1209
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:28,299
Now, I don't know what acid etiquette is,
but I just thought, "You don't..."

1210
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:32,553
They're having fun. There's no reason
that I should destroy their fun.

1211
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:36,432
Nor should I bring up something
that would show as if I'm in trouble,

1212
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,809
so they would feel
like they had to take care of me,

1213
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,394
which might even be worse.

1214
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,647
So, now I sat with a dictionary,

1215
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:47,109
looking for hints
of what my name might be.

1216
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,115
This goes on for half an hour,

1217
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,911
which, in LSD time, is probably 26 years.

1218
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,664
I reached into my pocket,

1219
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,166
'cause I realized that I had a wallet,

1220
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,377
and that I could find my name.

1221
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,046
And, truly, my next thought was...

1222
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:10,257
I was afraid to open my wallet
because I thought,

1223
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,551
"What if there's nothing in there
but Monopoly cards?"

1224
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,810
No!

1225
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:24,188
First it terrified me,
and then I couldn't stop laughing,

1226
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,065
and then I found my name again.

1227
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,653
And then things kind of got back on track.

1228
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,529
Guys!

1229
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,949
My name is Lewis Black.

1230
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,955
I've seen people bug out.

1231
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:43,598
So that's the only reason why
I don't recommend it for everybody.

1232
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:45,918
I'd be lying if I said it's for everybody,
it's not.

1233
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,421
"Just give it to me, yeah,
I'm ready, let's go!"

1234
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,464
I was so <i>not </i>ready to take acid.

1235
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:52,717
It was a huge mistake.

1236
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:06,605
In retrospect, I didn't realize how much
it was going to change my life.

1237
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:09,191
Because it really changed my life
for a long time.

1238
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:12,486
I just thought, "Alright, here we go,
this is gonna be great."

1239
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:16,615
I think we'd seen <i>Hair</i> recently,
which was a big influence.

1240
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:19,618
<i>♪ LSD ♪</i>

1241
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,371
<i>♪ LSD ♪</i>

1242
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:31,088
Well, I was hoping for some sort
of psychedelic, uh... revelation,

1243
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,424
uh, kind of <i>Hair-</i>like, you know,

1244
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,510
with just amazing sort of imagery,

1245
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:41,015
and just, you know...
just sort of some sort of opening

1246
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,726
into some sort of other form
of consciousness.

1247
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:46,562
And it just... It was not that at all.

1248
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:50,983
It was, uh, just fear and anxiety...

1249
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:55,237
being... Just being amplified.

1250
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,740
Which is not, you know, I...
like, who needs that?

1251
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,658
Who needs to take a drug
to have that happen?

1252
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,203
So I took one,

1253
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:05,081
half an hour goes by, 45 minutes go by,

1254
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,415
an hour goes by...

1255
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,335
We're hanging out,
and, of course, nothing's happening.

1256
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,378
Another half-hour goes by.

1257
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:15,257
Now it's an hour and a half,
and nothing's happening, so, of course...

1258
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,384
I say to him, "We gotta take another."

1259
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:20,513
So we took another,
and then something happened.

1260
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:23,224
Immediately, I started to freak out
and get really scared.

1261
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,642
I started looking at my hand,

1262
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:27,937
doing the cliche thing
of, like, pondering what my hand was.

1263
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,148
Isn't there always that thing of just,
like, staring at your hand?

1264
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:35,945
Or, like, your thumb, and, like, seeing
the whole universe in your thumb,

1265
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:37,028
that kind of thing...?

1266
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:40,950
What is going on in your brain
when you are tripping?

1267
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:45,746
Well, roughly 10% of your brain
is consumed by sound and color,

1268
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,874
another 10% by the concept of time,

1269
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,336
which has been known to speed up
and/or slow down.

1270
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:54,588
And the other 80%?

1271
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,091
Staring at your hand.

1272
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,845
Whoa, that's cool...

1273
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:03,806
I'm freaking out. I said,
"Let's just go to my house."

1274
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:07,059
And we were walking towards
where they blow up the balloon animals

1275
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,602
for the Thanksgiving Day Parade,

1276
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:11,313
and I started to trip out on that idea.

1277
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,150
Evil... giant... inflated characters

1278
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:17,736
were flipping up
and coming out of 77th Street.

1279
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,488
I was a big <i>Ghostbusters</i> fan,

1280
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:22,241
and so the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man image

1281
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:25,828
of him coming down Central Park West
was sort of in my mind...

1282
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:31,584
and then very quickly realizing
that I had no idea where I was,

1283
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,667
who I was,

1284
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,796
or what this whole...
the whole context of life was.

1285
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,549
I decided that I needed
to talk to my parents

1286
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,593
to tell them what was happening to me.

1287
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,929
And my parents were out of town,
filming a <i>Love Boat</i> episode.

1288
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,639
<i>♪ The Love Boat ♪</i>

1289
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,810
<i>♪ Soon we'll be making another... ♪</i>

1290
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:54,648
I called Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara
on the phone...

1291
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,027
...and I said, "Dad, I took some acid."

1292
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:00,821
And he said, "What? What is acid?"

1293
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:04,867
I think he might have thought
I drank some battery acid or something.

1294
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,453
It wasn't like my dad was Jerry Garcia.

1295
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:08,787
He's Jerry Stiller.

1296
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,372
And I said, "LSD."

1297
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,916
And he's like, "Oh, LSD."

1298
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,251
And I could hear him processing it.

1299
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:15,669
I think the immediate thought was

1300
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,963
I think he was thinking
he'd failed as a parent.

1301
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,466
I think that was what was
probably going through his mind.

1302
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,384
And then my dad said,

1303
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,678
"I understand what you're going through.

1304
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:28,515
When I was ten years old,
I smoked a Pall Mall cigarette,

1305
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,351
and I was sick for two days."

1306
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:33,771
And I said, "No, Dad,
that's not what I'm going through.

1307
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,522
This is a whole different experience."

1308
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:38,859
I tried to explain to him what it was,
and he basically said...

1309
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:42,613
He just said it's going to be okay,
which actually was really... sweet.

1310
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,493
When someone consumes a drug,
and they feel they're going crazy,

1311
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,828
the biggest fear is, "Oh, my God,

1312
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,998
I'm never going to return
to being myself again.

1313
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,875
I'm always going to be crazy."

1314
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:58,504
"My brain is broken,
and I'm never, ever coming back."

1315
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,297
"Maybe this is just my brain now.

1316
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,508
And this is now
how the world actually is."

1317
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,051
And that's... That can be scary.

1318
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,761
You know, "This isn't going well.

1319
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:08,264
I want this to end.
How do we make this end?"

1320
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,390
"Oh, my God.

1321
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:11,225
This is never going to end.

1322
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,811
I'm going to go
into a mental institution,"

1323
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:18,399
and then I would see my mother's face
in the window of the padded cell,

1324
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:19,650
bawling her eyes out.

1325
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:22,528
You cannot coax a person
out of their bad trip.

1326
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:26,198
And once it's in their system,
it takes its own time.

1327
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,158
The most important intervention
you can make

1328
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:32,204
is just to reassure them that
they're experiencing this altered state,

1329
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,664
as frightening as it is,

1330
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:36,208
but they're experiencing it
because they ingested a compound.

1331
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,168
The bad news is they're in a scary place,

1332
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,504
but the good news is
it's going to be time-limited.

1333
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:43,424
I think the first time
I had such an experience,

1334
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:48,887
I had those kind of naive... feelings.
You know, "Maybe I won't be normal again."

1335
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,890
But I've had enough experiences
to realize that that's not true.

1336
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,101
When in doubt, zoom out.

1337
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:58,314
Um... If you're fearful of something,
you just need to zoom away from it,

1338
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:01,317
so you can see the larger context,
and go, "Okay, that's not a big deal."

1339
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,027
Things get scary.

1340
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,821
But that's why it's important
to remember you're high.

1341
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:07,281
It's not reality.

1342
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,408
I'm literally just falling in my mind,

1343
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,371
and I'm like, "I gotta go
to the emergency room.

1344
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,703
I can't handle this anymore."

1345
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:14,997
There's one of those dudes
sitting in front of me,

1346
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,541
who's, like,
you used to see them at Dead shows,

1347
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:19,960
they've clearly been on too many trips.

1348
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,504
They sort of move at a different
frequency than other people.

1349
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:25,883
They're like, "Hey, man."
They've got this weird... you know.

1350
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:29,053
So I just tap him on the shoulder,
and I look at him, and go,

1351
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,930
"Pretty soon, Jerry's gonna come out,

1352
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:35,434
and him and his guitar are gonna be,
like, one thing."

1353
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,436
And this guy just looks at me
and he goes...

1354
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,814
"Just hang on, man."

1355
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:44,276
And he turns back around,
and I was like, "Okay."

1356
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,404
And that was, like, the best advice
I ever got. And I use it to this day.

1357
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,243
Just hang on, man.

1358
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,703
Thanks, Fred.

1359
01:12:56,538 --> 01:13:00,209
<i>And now
for the horrifying conclusion of </i>Bad Trip.

1360
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,002
Knock, knock, knock.

1361
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,170
"Who is it?"

1362
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:05,089
"It's a deranged drifter

1363
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:08,008
who wants to torture you
for the next 12 hours,

1364
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,594
by slowly peeling your skin off your body,

1365
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:13,305
then plucking out
your horror-filled eyeballs

1366
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,016
and feeding them to you
on a soft pretzel roll

1367
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,018
made of your own epidermis."

1368
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,353
"Oh, sure, great!

1369
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:20,437
Come on in!"

1370
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,022
Sounds crazy, right?

1371
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,066
Well, that's exactly what you're doing

1372
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:26,276
when you open your brain, the door,

1373
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,446
to hallucinogenics, the deranged drifter.

1374
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,949
Let's check in with Emily and her friends

1375
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:35,160
now that they have willingly agreed
to have their brains dissected,

1376
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,495
metaphorically,

1377
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:40,040
by the deranged psycho of psychedelics.

1378
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:47,756
We definitely made the right choice
getting out of that party.

1379
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,280
They wouldn't let us back in
after we broke all those windows.

1380
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,181
- Oh, no!
- Look out!

1381
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:13,490
<i>Well, you've seen two sides
of the LSD psychedelic question.</i>

1382
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:15,033
<i>But if you really think of it,</i>

1383
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,411
<i>there's been about 20 sides
to the question.</i>

1384
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:20,038
<i>While it's possible
that some things were left out,</i>

1385
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:24,626
<i>we did hear from the most important
and most strongly felt opinions about LSD.</i>

1386
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,711
<i>Now it's your turn.</i>

1387
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,005
<i>You decide.</i>

1388
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:32,176
You know, what we call everyday reality,

1389
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,428
is a projection of consciousness.

1390
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,514
In reality, there's no such thing
as colors or sounds,

1391
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:40,309
or textures, or tastes, or smells,

1392
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,311
in the so-called real world.

1393
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:46,899
The real world is a radically ambiguous
and ceaselessly flowing quantum soup.

1394
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:51,236
It's a fluctuation of energy
and information in an infinite void.

1395
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:55,657
The sky that an insect sees
is not the sky you and I see.

1396
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,911
A honey bee experiences, um,

1397
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:01,455
ultraviolet radiation

1398
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:04,166
I have no idea what that looks like,
you know?

1399
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:06,001
So when a honey bee looks at a flower,

1400
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:08,504
it doesn't see a flower
the way you and I see,

1401
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,714
although it can sense honey
from a distance.

1402
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:13,967
A snake experiences infrared radiation.

1403
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,845
A bat experiences the echo of ultrasound.

1404
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:19,598
A chameleon's eyeballs swivel
on two different axes.

1405
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:23,560
You can't even remotely imagine
what this would look like to a chameleon.

1406
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,187
So, what's reality?

1407
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,397
And the answer is there's no such thing.

1408
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,234
These compounds,
when utilized under optimal conditions,

1409
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:33,320
seem to have
a rather remarkable facility

1410
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:37,741
for catalyzing
spiritual-level experiences,

1411
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:39,409
which by their very nature

1412
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:42,496
may be... may have the potential
to be transformative.

1413
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:47,834
It enhanced my ability
to navigate the world,

1414
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,711
to be in a family,

1415
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,338
to relate to my children,

1416
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:53,799
to relate to my wife, to my colleagues.

1417
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:57,594
Um... It teaches me about community,

1418
01:15:57,678 --> 01:16:02,182
and it teaches me that the core
of all religious thought ought to be...

1419
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:06,436
"Let me treat others the way
I want to be treated myself."

1420
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,438
Whenever it was a good trip,

1421
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:11,358
I would think, "Oh, my God, we're all one.

1422
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:14,111
Uh... Death is not something to fear.

1423
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:17,739
Life and death are really walking
hand-in-hand with each other,

1424
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:18,781
and it's cool."

1425
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:22,160
The first time,
or the first couple times I tripped,

1426
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,956
I... I really did believe
every single person,

1427
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:30,752
the planet would be a better planet
if everybody took acid once.

1428
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:34,131
Did it make me smarter?
Did I become enlightened?

1429
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:36,717
I don't know. But I think it...

1430
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:41,597
It enabled me, early on,
to imagine another point of view.

1431
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,265
Another perspective.

1432
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:45,517
I think it made me a better person,

1433
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,395
both creatively, and in every other way.

1434
01:16:48,478 --> 01:16:50,939
I'd rather be a person
who's had that in his past

1435
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:53,358
than somebody who missed it.

1436
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,776
Even now, in my adult life,

1437
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,571
I continue to experience it
as a very psychedelic adventure,

1438
01:16:57,654 --> 01:17:01,283
that is, like, a, you know,
a baffling nonsensical riddle.

1439
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,910
Let's face it, we're all gonna die,
so, you know...

1440
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,288
It was kind of like
jumping out of an airplane.

1441
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:08,790
About a second-and-a-half into it,
I realize,

1442
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,335
"Oh, I never need to do this again,
ever, in my life.

1443
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:13,211
I don't ever want to do this."

1444
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:16,381
That was sort of my experience with acid
a few minutes into it,

1445
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,383
only it lasted for another six hours.

1446
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:19,635
That was the problem.

1447
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:23,305
I think what I'd say to anyone
tripping for the first time

1448
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:25,307
is be moderate.

1449
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:28,435
It's the haircut theory:
you can always cut more off.

1450
01:17:29,102 --> 01:17:32,064
But once you cut too much,
once you've taken too much,

1451
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,440
there's no turning back.

1452
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:35,776
I thought I'll never do that again,

1453
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:38,028
but I did, a few more times.

1454
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:41,448
You should not take it cavalierly.
I don't know if you should take it.

1455
01:17:41,531 --> 01:17:44,201
In the sky, I see a giant zipper.

1456
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:48,789
And the zipper starts to open.

1457
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:51,625
Now, if you go with the flow,

1458
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:53,794
you let the zipper open.

1459
01:17:53,877 --> 01:17:55,253
And you just fucking deal.

1460
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:58,632
If they're bats,
if it's God's penis, whatever.

1461
01:17:58,715 --> 01:17:59,925
You just do it.

1462
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,928
Okay, if you have any fucking sense
when it comes to drugs,

1463
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,222
you don't stop the zipper.

1464
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:09,935
I'm always looking to evolve
as a human being.

1465
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,938
I think we do that
by thinking out of the box, you know.

1466
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,607
We have to accept
that the box is just a construct.

1467
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:18,318
It's something
that we've been conditioned to accept,

1468
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,195
but it's not particularly useful.

1469
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:21,613
Everything is in crisis.

1470
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,532
How are we gonna survive the crisis?

1471
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,492
How do we get over
the other side of the wall?

1472
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:28,995
And so we need to use
whatever tools it takes

1473
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:30,747
to get over the other side.

1474
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:33,333
It's like a step ladder
to look over a brick wall

1475
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,897
that's a little bit too tall for you.

1476
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,921
You use a stepladder,
you get to see this crazy landscape

1477
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:42,008
that you kind of had an inkling about
every time you walked by this wall,

1478
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:45,554
and then some people, you know,
can sit in front of the wall,

1479
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:48,557
and, like, meditate,
and then the wall becomes transparent,

1480
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,267
and they see beyond it, you know?

1481
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:53,854
So, there are many pathways
to arrive at the same realization.

1482
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:55,731
It's a tremendous asset,

1483
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:57,566
freedom to learn about it,

1484
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:00,569
and not have our government
stop us from learning things

1485
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:02,372
that could really be...
Same with marijuana.

1486
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,740
I mean, they take away
all the possible discovery

1487
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,992
of all the medicine it could be.

1488
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,161
What I would envision

1489
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:12,372
really would be
a certified retreat center,

1490
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,625
you know, preferably close to nature,

1491
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,545
where individuals can go
and have a treatment,

1492
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:23,258
and have expert facilitators
help guide them through the experience,

1493
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:27,304
and afterwards help them integrate
that experience into their lives.

1494
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,724
If I may say so,
the whole consciousness revolution

1495
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:32,809
that started in the '60s,

1496
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,561
which led to other movements,

1497
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:35,854
the feminist movement,

1498
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:37,397
the ecology movement,

1499
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,940
the peace movement,

1500
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,859
uh, Greenpeace, all of that,

1501
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:43,612
began, um...

1502
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:47,240
with the use of hallucinogenic drugs.

1503
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:50,076
Many people think that it peaked
and it went away.

1504
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:55,207
Uh... I'm sorry to inform you,
the awakening is still going on.

1505
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:57,292
We're on a trip all the time.

1506
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,795
Right now we're on a trip, right?
Life is a trip.

1507
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,037
Lots of people drink coffee
before they go to work.

1508
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,414
Others, believe it or not, drop acid.

1509
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,501
Now, why some psychiatrists
and researchers

1510
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:42,337
are giving psychedelic drugs a second look

1511
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:46,174
as a possible way of treating depression
and some mental illnesses.

1512
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:50,095
They're being used to treat depression,
anxiety, and addiction.

1513
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,264
The early results are impressive.

1514
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:55,559
They're relatively non-toxic,
less toxic than alcohol.

1515
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,018
They're non-addictive.

1516
01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:00,021
The DEA says it's granted permission
to more than 50 researchers

1517
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:03,149
to study the therapeutic effects of LSD.

1518
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:05,652
Denver has become
the first city in America

1519
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:08,405
to decriminalize psychedelic mushrooms.

1520
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:11,741
The city of Oakland is now
the second city in the US

1521
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:16,288
to decriminalize the adult use
and possession of magic mushrooms.

1522
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:19,624
The Santa Cruz City Council
unanimously approved the resolution.

1523
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:23,461
This decriminalizes the use,
possession and cultivation

1524
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,921
of psychoactive plants.

1525
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:27,674
If you could use a drug,
and this has been done now,

1526
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:31,052
that could stop you smoking cigarettes
or being an alcoholic,

1527
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,055
you know, working maybe 80% of the time,
at least initially...

1528
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,055
Yeah.

1529
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:36,934
We gotta explore how that's possible.

1530

1
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,631
You got any room on that couch?
You got a naked girl coming right at you.

2
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,670
Bring it on.
Go on.

3
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,342
Go on.

4
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,781
Come here, you little monkey.
Will you please get her dressed?

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,678
Let's clean up before
Bama gets here.

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,251
I don't want her telling me
I'm a lousy housekeeper.

7
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,479
Oh, shoot. I gotta get ready.
We're supposed to be at the bank.

8
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,452
Why do you have
to go to the bank?

9
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,626
Because we need money
for stuff, like your braces.

10
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,988
But I don't want braces.
I want a video game player.

11
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,494
Charlie, your mama's gonna tell you
something true.

12
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,929
No matter what you choose to do or be,
life is easier if you're pretty.

13
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,002
It does a girl no good
to be good at video games.

14
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,332
Knock, knock. Hey, y'all.
Hi, Mama.

15
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,102
Hey, Bama.
Hey, Bama.

16
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,641
It's hotter than a fur coat
in Marfa out there.

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,507
Guess you're just gonna let them
watch TV all day.

18
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,149
Oh, Mama, please don't start.
I'm trying to get ready.

19
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,684
Hey, Mama, that laundry was folded.
It will be when I get through.

20
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,782
Hi, Bama.

21
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,154
Jenna. One, two. Whoo!

22
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,755
I'm so glad to see you.
Give Bama a great big kiss right there.

23
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,400
Look how big you're getting.
How's it going, Cassie?

24
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,231
Well, I'm a two-pack-a-dayer trying to
quit smoking, that's how it's going.

25
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,873
You know what gum
with nicotine tastes like?

26
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,940
Gum with nicotine.

27
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,736
How's the knee?

28
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,210
Oh, doesn't work
and keeps me up all night.

29
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,940
Sounds like my last two husbands.
Heh.

30
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,247
What are you gonna do
if the bank turns you down?

31
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,443
No idea.

32
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,681
Well, it ain't a sin to be poor,
but it's damned inconvenient.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,224
Well, what do y'all think?

34
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,692
You're either a magician or twins.

35
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,923
Mama, you look pretty.
You sure do.

36
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,602
It's gonna be harder for the banker
to turn you down in that outfit.

37
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,329
That's what I'm counting on.
Like you said, 'Use it until you lose it.'

38
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,303
Heck, I've lost it
and I'm still using it.

39
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,939
What smells like pumpkin pie?
Oh, it's me.

40
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,206
These scientists did a test and
figured out that the smell of pumpkin

41
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,748
brings blood How to a man's you-know-what
faster than anything else.

42
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,079
Where'd you hear that?
I read it in some woman's magazine.

43
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,889
August 2006 issue.
Reese Witherspoon was on the cover.

44
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,820
Rex, come on, we gotta scoot.

45
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,516
Babies, be good to your Bama.

46
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,094
Bye, Mama.
Bye, Mama.

47
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,899
Owl Dang it.
I just broke my nail.

48
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,796
Sugar, no one's looking
at your nails.

49
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,268
Been married to you nine years,
I haven't gotten to your nails yet.

50
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,496
Come on.

51
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,733
Now, Sam, don't slouch like you do.
Knockers up.

52
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,380
I am so nervous.
Yeah, me too.

53
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,981
Let me unbutton these.

54
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,617
Just in case he's gay.

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,778
Well, I did say 'whatever it hikes.”

56
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,751
Oh, baby, how did we get ourselves
into such an awful mess?

57
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,983
A lot of people asking
those questions these days.

58
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,957
Samantha Horton.

59
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,563
Hell's bells, I do not need Carol
Reed telling me how perfect her life is.

60
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,825
Hey, I dumped her for you.
You got the big prize.

61
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,400
Don't tell her
why we're here.

62
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,731
Hey, Carol. Hi.
It's been forever.

63
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:15,929
Don't you look pretty.

64
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,235
I do believe you were wearing that
same dress the last time I saw you.

65
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,740
Well, aren't you observant.

66
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,175
Jim and I were just here
on business,

67
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,816
but tomorrow we're off to Hawaii
and then we're going to New York

68
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,576
to do a little shopping.

69
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,948
We all got to stimulate
the economy, right?

70
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,488
Bless your heart,
always thinking of others.

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,182
Bye-bye.

72
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,951
Y'all travel safe.
Will do.

73
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,823
Bye.

74
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,931
Mrs. Horton, Mr. Horton,
please have a seat.

75
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,122
Thank you.

76
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:47,794
Well, we're here about,
uh, this letter.

77
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,373
Well, I'd say
it's a bit more than a letter.

78
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,773
This is a notice of intent
to foreclose.

79
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,609
Yes, and we know we're
seriously behind in our payments,

80
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,183
but the rates
suddenly jumped so high-

81
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,819
As adjustable rates do.

82
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,422
Mr. Sweeny, it's like I was trying
to tell you on the telephone,

83
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,059
my physical therapy job
just got phased out

84
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,490
and Rex here, well,
he hurt his knee so bad

85
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,187
that he had to quit his
construction job and get surgery.

86
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,060
We're just trying to pay back
the medical bills.

87
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,361
The heeling's been
e whole let slower than I'd hoped.

88
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,368
I sympathize, but mortgage payments
must be maintained-

89
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,906
It's not just about the mortgage.
We're strapped.

90
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,543
Completely.

91
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,977
Getting dinner on the table, it's hard.
We need more time.

92
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,050
But, Mrs. Horton,
I can't really give you-

93
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,220
You can call me Sam.

94
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,048
Sam.

95
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,695
That's an interesting scent
you're wearing.

96
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,660
You like it?
Very much.

97
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,263
But, uh, there's nothing I can do.

98
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,461
With the current financial situation,

99
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,575
this bank must hike a zero-tolerance
position on non-payment.

100
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,541
But what about the government
hailing you out to help us out?

101
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,769
Where's the help?

102
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,970
All I can tell you

103
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,413
is that unless we receive payment
on the 15th of this month,

104
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,451
foreclosure proceedings will begin.

105
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,554
And we'll lose our home.
Yes.

106
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,747
That is what foreclosure means.

107
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,052
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.

108
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,992
Not really.

109
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,729
Even though
you're plenty at fault here too.

110
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:23,923
The day we met you,

111
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:27,229
you told us that a subprime
ARM loan made good sense

112
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,464
and not to worry
about rate adjustments

113
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,539
because we would be able
to refinance before the loan resets.

114
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,540
Then you told us it would be
'advantageous

115
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,146
for us to enhance our income statement to
help facilitate the approving process.”

116
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,975
Those were your words, exactly.

117
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,982
Now, I don't think any of us
remembers exactly what was said.

118
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,422
She does.

119
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,488
You were wearing a
black-and-gray coat,

120
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,522
with a taupe shirt
and a cream tie.

121
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,753
It had a quarter-sized
hot sauce shin on it.

122
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,694
You were worried because you were
getting ready to take your photo ID.

123
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,771
There's the tie
and there's the shin.

124
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,574
Now, what exactly
don't I remember, exactly?

125
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,777
Like I said.

126
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,753
At least you got a month's extension.
It's something.

127
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,355
Is it? What's gonna make it better
next month?

128
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,286
Chocolate milk shakes
and cheese fries.

129
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,257
That will make it better
for about five minutes, but I'll take it.

130
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,656
Here's my application.

131
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,924
I know you guys aren't hiring, but if you
could have the manager keep that on file?

132
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,363
Thanks.
You're really desperate, huh?

133
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,537
I would join the Army
if I could wear heels.

134
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,570
We'd hire you at the bar if we could.
I know you would.

135
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,039
There's nothing promising for Rex
Not a thing.

136
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,267
Nobody's even hiring.

137
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,845
If there were any construction jobs, they're
not gonna go for a guy with a bum knee.

138
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,846
Gosh, this must be killing him.
You know men and pride.

139
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,313
Men are complicated.

140
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,885
No, they're not. Men are easy.

141
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,818
”I'm thirsty,” ”I'm hungry,” ”I'm horny.”
That's men.

142
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,356
Although not necessarily
in that order.

143
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,789
You guys, I never thought I'd
say anything quite as sappy

144
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,897
as 'it was not supposed
to turn out this way,” but it wasn't.

145
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,000
When they were scouting Rex for UT, I already
had the drapes picked out for the pool house.

146
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,567
You weren't crazy.

147
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,171
Handsome white running back
is worth his weight in gold.

148
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,201
I just thought we were gonna be the
next Angie Harmon and Jason Sehorn.

149
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,503
Then he got knocked down.
You got knocked up.

150
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,270
Yeah.

151
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,371
Hey, wait a minute.
Here's something.

152
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,483
'Kind Touch Health Spa.
Licensed massage therapists.”

153
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,675
I'm licensed.

154
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,481
I don't know how you do that,
touching stranger's bodies.

155
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,090
It's just skin.
It makes them feel better.

156
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,386
Doesn't say they're hiring,
but it's worth a call.

157
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,060
It's all the way in Lareena.
It's more than an hour's drive.

158
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,731
Well, there's nothing here.

159
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,832
You were smart to go
and become a lawyer.

160
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,003
My mom said
I was too pretty for law school.

161
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,331
My mama said I was too skinny
to get a husband.

162
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:45,065
My mom said to always wear lipstick,
even if you're just going to the market.

163
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,141
Well, to Texas moms.

164
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,370
Texas moms.
Texas moms.

165
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,911
Your usual time, you little devil.

166
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,381
Okay, I've got to go now.

167
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,780
All right, bye-bye.

168
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,455
Hi, there. Can I help you?
Hi.

169
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,887
My name's Samantha Horton, and I called
about the massage therapy interview?

170
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,321
Oh, that's right.

171
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,189
Here's my resume.
Hi.

172
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,057
Hi there. Well, I'm Jacie.
Hello.

173
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,756
And this here is my partner, Doreen.

174
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,458
Good morning.
Gosh, you are a pretty little thing.

175
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,695
Thank you.
And I can spot a pageant smile.

176
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,101
What did you win?
I was Miss Bixby Hills.

177
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,072
Runner-up, Miss Piedmont.
I dropped my baton.

178
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,836
Well, I entered in Miss Texas,

179
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,742
but then I got pregnant and married.
Now I got three kids.

180
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,577
I'm dying to have babies.
You were smart to start young.

181
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,049
I'm trained in shiatsu,
and deep tissue,

182
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,244
but I can pretty much do any
kind of massage y'all want.

183
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,754
Well, look at you.

184
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:11,793
I'm a real fast learner,
and I'm just desperate for a job.

185
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,189
Can you start tomorrow?

186
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,997
Really? That's it?

187
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,667
Pretty much, baby.

188
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,693
Thank you.

189
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,973
Who's starving?
I could eat a buttered monkey.

190
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,163
Yay! Breakfast for supper.

191
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,502
Yeah, we're celebrating
Mama's new job.

192
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,647
So now I can play Hag football?

193
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,547
Flag football is way down on the list
of things we need to be paying for.

194
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,447
Please?
Brady, it's like $100 just to register.

195
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,755
Then there's the team photo and equipment.
And what if you break your glasses?

196
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,482
But-
Conversation is over.

197
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,825
Hey, hon,
I didn't hear your motorcycle.

198
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,792
That's because I sold it.

199
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,294
Rex, you loved that thing.

200
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,866
Yeah, I kind of like
having electricity too.

201
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,130
Baby, I know that wasn't easy.
Good riddance.

202
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,740
You know what doctors call them?
Donor-cycles.

203
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,410
Are we rich now?
No.

204
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,979
Hey, sweetheart, what's it
like at that Kind Touch Health Spa?

205
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,344
What's it like?
Oh, no, a bee.

206
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,486
Watch out, Brady,
they can smell your fear.

207
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,484
Hey. Mama.
It's all right, I got it.

208
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:14,920
You know what, it was real nice.
Rich clients, big tips.

209
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,115
Yeah?

210
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,317
Maybe I should ditch my job
at the salon

211
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,121
and come rub some backs
with you.

212
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,857
Unless they're mole-y or hairy.
Woman, you wax hoo-has.

213
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,162
Yeah, I remove the hair,
but I don't mess with it.

214
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,237
What's hoo-has?
Nothing.

215
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,772
Daddy, what is a hoo-ha?

216
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,011
Camptown ladies sing this song

217
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,514
Hoo-has, hoo-has

218
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,617
Camptown track is Eve miles long

219
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,378
Oh, hoo-he day

220
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,113
Hi. Here I am.

221
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,622
Oh, hey, honey. Welcome.

222
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,727
Why don't you come on back
and meet the other girls, okay?

223
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,521
We got a bit of a lull right now,

224
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,189
but when that Cowboys-Redskins game
is done, we are gonna be plenty busy.

225
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,030
Come on.

226
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,260
Okay.

227
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,405
All right.

228
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,903
Here we go.

229
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,508
Okay, ladies, say hi to Sam.

230
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,046
Hey, honey, welcome back.
Hi.

231
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,344
Okay, now, just real quick,
I started this business 15 years ago.

232
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,817
I wanted to be a novelist,
and I still do,

233
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,115
but this pays the bills
a whole lot better.

234
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,814
Doreen used to be a dancer.

235
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,290
Well, cruise ships mostly,
but some dinner theatre.

236
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,360
Now, she's been partners
with me for 10 years.

237
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,622
Isn't that right?
Yeah.

238
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,857
Tanya's been with us for-
Six.

239
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,003
Six, that's right, and she is also
an amazing tattoo artist.

240
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,639
Oh, and this here is Emma,
our barely-legal-looking newbie.

241
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,639
How long you been here, sweetie?
Uh, two months today.

242
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:40,833
So nice.

243
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,479
Hey, hon, you got a client in 4,
why don't you scoot on over.

244
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,773
All right.
Okay.

245
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,644
And you're all licensed
massage therapists?

246
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,151
Sure, yeah, we all have licenses,
and we all give massage.

247
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,348
It's a teensy bit more than that.
What do you mean?

248
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,526
Well, like my writing teacher
always says:

249
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,594
'Why don't you show me,
not tell me?'

250
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,696
Come on over here,
I'll show you.

251
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,296
Let me just
get these open here.

252
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,337
Hi, Richard.

253
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,101
This is one of those two-way jobs,

254
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,904
you know, like they have
in all the cop shows.

255
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,274
How are you doing?
Pretty good.

256
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,643
How are you?
I'm great.

257
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,908
Oh, I love that SVU.

258
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,816
I think Mariska Hargihy,
she's just darling.

259
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,753
And her mama is Jayne Mansfield,
so you know those breasts are real.

260
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,361
Now, for safety, we always bring
the first-time clients into this room.

261
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,657
It's above board, nobody does
anything they're not comfortable with.

262
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,357
You understand?

263
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,168
Wow.

264
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,703
You understand?

265
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,443
Yeah, I guess.

266
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,171
Okay.

267
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,726
What am I gonna do now?

268
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,796
I guess that's why they didn't
show me around the first day.

269
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,558
Wanted to ease me into it.

270
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,965
Guess I'll have to find something else,
or maybe Rex will get a job

271
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,505
or maybe that lottery ticket I've got in
my purse has three good numbers on it.

272
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,779
Hey, Dee, what's up?

273
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,471
It's Rex. You kind of need
to come pick him up.

274
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,241
He's in no condition to drive.

275
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,215
You know how it gets in here
when the Cowboys lose.

276
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,355
I'm on my way.

277
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,892
Dee, isn't it hard being
on your feet in your condition?

278
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,086
I'm used to it.

279
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:45,292
Heck, four kids in five years,
it feels weird when I'm not pregnant.

280
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,799
And it's good for business.

281
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,131
Behind the bar,
the big boobs keep them here,

282
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,366
and at closing time she comes out
and the belly sends them home.

283
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,476
Ha, ha, ha. Fair enough.

284
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,010
Stupid.

285
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,479
Where is he?
He's cleaning up in the john.

286
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,883
We'll help him get into the truck.
Yeah, he's gonna need it.

287
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:16,460
I can walk, man, I can walk.
Dude, you can't walk.

288
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,795
Rex had a rough day, Sam.

289
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,996
And your mom took the kids, told
him to come blow off some steam.

290
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,106
Yeah, well, good idea, Mom.

291
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,004
Thank you, Phil.
Sure thing.

292
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,145
Take care of my boy.

293
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,171
So I heard you got a job.

294
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
That one in Lareena, right?

295
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,347
That's so awesome.

296
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,680
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna work out.

297
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,322
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

298
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,720
Sometimes I wish
I could just start all over again.

299
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,656
Come on, this isn't you.

300
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,488
You're Samantha Dale Horton.

301
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,097
You're the prettiest girl
this town has ever seen,

302
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,030
and you always get
what you want.

303
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,465
Besides, I've spent too many years
being jealous of you

304
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,105
to feel sorry for you now.

305
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,740
You'll figure this out.

306
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,104
I am so sure of it.
I wish I was.

307
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,770
Hey, I love you.
Love you.

308
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,548
You call me tomorrow.
Okay.

309
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,860
Well, folks, if you moved to Texas...

310
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,590
Damn it, Rex, we're
almost out of gas.

311
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,530
We're looking at temperatures
in the 90s all week long,

312
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,263
possibly hitting triple digits
by the weekend.

313
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,169
Dang gas guzzler.

314
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,906
You look good.
Well, you sure don't.

315
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,911
What were you thinking?

316
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:44,144
Look, I spent all day standing
outside of Kyle's Lumber Lot

317
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:48,814
with the other day laborers
trying to pick up some odd job

318
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:53,724
that would pay enough for me
to sign up my son for flag football.

319
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,057
Rex.

320
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,361
Hon, the whole day,

321
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,197
I'm watching people we know
coming out of that store,

322
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,873
and I could see it on their faces.

323
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:10,011
'Look how far the football hero
has fallen.”

324
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,180
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,477
I had a bad day too.

326
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,090
Stupid gas-guzzling piece of junk.

327
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,954
Declined.

328
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,431
Rex, where's your wallet?

329
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,668
It's, uh...

330
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,397
It's in my pocket.

331
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,409
A dollar?

332
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,549
Damn it, Rex,
this is not what I signed up for.

333
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,740
This is America.

334
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,281
A girl this pretty,
she's not supposed to be poor.

335
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,922
I'm sorry, I know that sounds
all braggy and unfair and awful,

336
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,114
but you know what? It's true.

337
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:02,494
You know what? Dee was right.

338
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,791
She was right. I am Sam Horton.

339
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:10,602
I am Sam Horton,
and I do not let life get me down.

340
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,603
I do what I have to do,

341
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,240
and I don't get defeated.

342
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,291
Rex.

343
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,603
Jacie?

344
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:50,837
Hi, it's Sam.

345
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,614
Sam Horton.

346
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,823
I'm so sorry that
I walked out on y'all today.

347
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,934
I'll see you tomorrow.

348
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,140
A-V-O-I-D.

349
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,312
Avoid.

350
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,775
Vacuum.

351
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,609
V-A-C-U-U-M.

352
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,011
Vacuum.

353
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,710
Good. Now tableau.
Tableau. T-A-

354
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,549
So now can I go out for Hag football?
No.

355
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,622
It's not T-A?
No, I was talking to Brady.

356
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,657
You want an apple or an orange?
Orange.

357
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,851
Please?
No.

358
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,863
B-L-E-A-U. Tableau.

359
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,227
Perfect.

360
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,494
You're gonna do fine.
We're all gonna do fine.

361
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,932
Everything's gonna be fine.

362
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,573
There's nothing to be scared of,
I mean it.

363
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,971
Sorry. It's Mama's first day at work,
and I can't pick you up at school,

364
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,671
so to say I'm sorry, I put two
desserts in both your lunches.

365
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,179
Wow, your new job's great.

366
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,080
Come on, scoot.

367
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,550
I'm sitting behind Mama.
No, you aren't.

368
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,885
You went last time.
Mama.

369
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,916
You know, and I pride myself
on running a safe, clean business.

370
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,420
We provide a reliable service
at reasonable rates.

371
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,354
We're like Dairy
Queen, except not fattening.

372
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,553
We are open Saturday to
Thursday, noon to midnight,

373
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,789
but this being Friday, payday,
we start early

374
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,990
and stay till the last one leaves.

375
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,797
It's real important that I work only
when my kids are at school.

376
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,405
Oh, that's fine.
We do a huge lunch crowd.

377
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,576
All the outfits are
in a room in the back,

378
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,745
but each of these rooms
have everything you need.

379
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,504
There's condoms and oils
and such.

380
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,773
Oh, and drinks and Viagra
are on the house.

381
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,011
You give away Viagra?
It pays for itself.

382
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,154
The little blue pill
keeps us in the black.

383
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,220
We were worried
when the economy tanked,

384
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:17,292
but turns out that this is the most
recession-proof business there is.

385
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,654
And what about the police?

386
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,593
Oh, well, let's just say doughnuts ain't
the only thing they're getting for free.

387
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,496
Alrighty, let's get you
on in the back room,

388
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,932
because everybody's here
on Friday.

389
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,935
Alrighty.

390
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,598
Now, for everyone's protection,
none of us uses a real name.

391
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,611
Doreen is Sugar,
Emma wants to be called Salome.

392
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,340
She won't do anything that's
not mentioned in the Bible.

393
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,645
Lucky for us, that's not all limiting.
Tanya is Margarita.

394
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,448
Unless the guy's into Asian
chicks, then I'm Sake.

395
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,785
That's right, and I'm Big Mama.
I do mostly fetish stuff.

396
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,484
I got me some kick-ass feet.

397
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:55,791
So you, I think,

398
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,400
we are gonna call you Brandy.

399
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,763
Because you look like
you go down real smooth.

400
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,438
Brandy, okay.

401
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,699
Now, like you saw yesterday,
we screen everybody upfront,

402
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,172
but if you got any problems at all,
you holler. All right?

403
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,778
You know how to use a gun, baby?
No.

404
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:10,969
I'll teach you.

405
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,649
Tanya used to be a bounty hunter.
It's crazy.

406
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,048
Anyway, you got any questions?
No, I just feel like I might be sick.

407
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,653
First time's the hardest.

408
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,518
It's like the first time
you kill someone. It gels easier.

409
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,556
This was always easy for you,
come on.

410
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,228
What can I say? I love sex.

411
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,226
I'm getting paid to do
something I love.

412
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,489
That is such a blessing.
Right?

413
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,291
You know, the work is what it is.

414
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,730
You got to get into
your own headspace on that,

415
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,369
but at the end of the day...

416
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,334
Beats the hell out of waitressing.

417
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,836
Nine a.m. Well, it is Friday,
that's for sure.

418
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,240
Okay, girls.

419
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,609
This will help some.

420
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,144
I'm still getting used to it.

421
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,456
You don't even look old enough
to drink.

422
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,887
What brought you here?

423
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,325
I ran away from home
to try out for American Idol,

424
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,924
but they said I wasn't ready yet.

425
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,828
So I'm saving money
for a singing coach.

426
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,495
You can't get home?

427
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,639
My family's Pentecostal.

428
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:14,334
They're not real supportive
of my Hollywood ambitions.

429
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,240
I kind of liked being all rebellious
at first, but now,

430
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,839
I don't know.

431
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,511
The money's good,

432
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:27,020
but God's always watching,
you know?

433
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:32,058
I really did not need that thought
in my head right now.

434
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,764
Emma, honey, you're Room 1,
and, Sam, you're in Room 4.

435
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,798
There's some pretty little outfits
beck there for you, okay?

436
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,426
Oh, that feels really good, honey.
Mm-mm-mm.

437
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,960
Well, thank you.

438
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,893
So where you from?

439
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,068
Am I supposed to answer that?
No.

440
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,794
Sorry, I'm just kind of nervous.
It's my first time.

441
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:18,497
Not massaging, but, you know...
Really?

442
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,371
Yeah, me too.
Oh.

443
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,568
Well, now, look at us,
two peas in a pod.

444
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,007
So are you married?
Yeah.

445
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,310
That's why I'm here.

446
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,322
What the hell?
Well, that wasn't respectful.

447
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,082
This may be my first time,

448
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,487
but I'm pretty sure you're not
supposed to hit me.

449
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,821
A man is not supposed to
put down his wife.

450
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,462
When was the last time
you told her she was beautiful?

451
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:44,656
I don't know, but-

452
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,336
Men, they fall in love
with their eyes,

453
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,733
but women,
we fall in love with our ears.

454
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,306
Ah.
You remember that I said that.

455
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,735
Oh.

456
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,608
Dang it. I am so sorry.

457
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,840
That's my phone.
I forgot to turn it off.

458
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,348
Oh, it's my daughter's school,
I need to hike this.

459
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,818
Hey. Hey, baby, what's up?

460
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,422
No, you didn't.

461
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,492
You won the whole spelling bee?
Well, with what word?

462
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,424
Diphthong?
Now, that's a hard word.

463
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,723
Do you know how to spell diphthong?
What?

464
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,231
Okay, you know what,
we're gonna celebrate tonight.

465
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,130
Mama loves you. Bye.

466
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,897
Can you believe that?

467
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,099
This isn't quite
what I imagined.

468
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,212
You know, your kid calling,
me hiking about my wife.

469
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,507
Maybe I should just-
Okay, please.

470
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,144
Please, you can't go.

471
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,184
Look, I really need this job, and-

472
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,083
Can I just have a do-over?
Huh?

473
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,280
I promise
that you'll leave here satisfied.

474
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,427
Because when I do something,
I do it right.

475
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,485
And you know what?

476
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,791
Maybe I can help you get a little bit
more of what you need at home.

477
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,365
Now, when was the last time

478
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:54,196
that you bought something special
for your wife?

479
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,206
I don't know. Uh- Uh-

480
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,840
On her birthday, I guess, but-

481
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,102
Okay, well, then, you need to get her
something for no reason.

482
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,007
And I'm not talking about flowers.

483
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,581
I mean something real fancy,
like an expensive watch.

484
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,950
I'm sorry, honey,
this is not what I paid for.

485
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,281
Lookit, this isn't quite
what I had in mind.

486
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,754
I know what you paid for.

487
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,993
You're a very pretty lady
and all, but I just-

488
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,964
It's kind of not the right feeling
I'm getting here somehow.

489
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,262
Okay, this is what you paid for.

490
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,949
You see all that money right there?
That's just from one day.

491
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:49,023
I mean, I gotta worry about the kids,
and the bills, and the house, right?

492
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,722
I mean, I'm only gonna do it
until we get ahead.

493
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,965
I can do this. It's gonna be fine.

494
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:01,927
And it's gonna be fine.

495
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,840
Ugh...

496
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,738
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna have to pull over.

497
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,175
Hey, Sam, what's up?
I need some girlfriend talk, right now.

498
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,218
Well, stop looking so shocked.

499
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,356
I'm sorry, Sam,
but this is my shocked face.

500
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,790
If you want me to look different, you might
need to say something less shocking.

501
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,793
I was just hoping
for a little sympathy.

502
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,023
Thought Pretty Women was
your favorite movie.

503
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,723
Oh, God, I love that movie.

504
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,233
When is Julia Roberts gonna make
another one that good?

505
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,597
Dee, focus.
Sorry.

506
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,272
I just needed somebody
to talk to.

507
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,772
I couldn't tell Laura,
she'd have me arrested.

508
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,500
And, God, please don't tell Phil.

509
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,235
Of course I won't tell Phil.

510
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:20,405
What wife tells her husband
that someone like you is available?

511
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,915
Oh, God, Sam, this is just-

512
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,644
I don't know.

513
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,015
Wow.

514
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,815
That's what I made today.

515
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:36,096
Holy sugar.
I'm not proud of it.

516
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:44,732
You know, you work in a bar,
you kind of stop judging people.

517
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:50,242
Just please be careful,
and the sooner you stop, the better.

518
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,244
I will. Thank you.

519
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:56,085
So, what's it like?

520
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:01,583
Well, to be honest, the thing they
want most is for you to lie to them.

521
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,454
They wanna know their guts are small
and their johnsons are big,

522
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,595
even if the truth
is sharing you right in the face.

523
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,594
Oh, my Lord.

524
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,393
Oh, God,
please tell me I'm not crazy.

525
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:18,364
It sounds like men aren't the only ones
who wanna be lied to.

526
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,474
You got that right.

527
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,443
You go home.

528
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,742
I gotta go tell my fat husband
he's hot.

529
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,521
Hey, everybody, I'm home.

530
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,789
Hey, babe.
Hey.

531
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,624
I made spaghetti.
I can see that.

532
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:47,326
Sorry I'm running a little bit late,
but I went shopping.

533
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,334
What did you get?
Let me see.

534
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,073
For the spelling champ.
Suzy Style Doll?

535
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:58,076
And for you.

536
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,306
Thank you.
Thank you, Mommy.

537
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,984
And I think that's for you.

538
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,915
Does this mean I can play football?
Yes, it does.

539
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,284
Yes!
Hey.

540
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,290
Go out for a pass.

541
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,926
Can we afford this?
We can now.

542
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:20,992
Oh...

543
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,899
I'll work with him.

544
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,733
Come here, buddy.

545
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,282
So, what exactly
does an actuary do?

546
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,848
Um, it's a little hard to explain.

547
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,541
You're gonna be fine.

548
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,946
It's beautiful.

549
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,084
This is why
you're my favorite customer.

550
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,014
I am?

551
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,252
This is why
you're my favorite customer.

552
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,259
Really? Me?

553
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,058
Mm-hm.

554
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,041
He just gave it to me
right out of the blue.

555
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,653
Well, whatever you
two want, it's on me.

556
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,993
Thanks, Sam.

557
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,926
Little girls'.
Be right back.

558
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,466
I know you're not supposed to say
it, but I just love having money.

559
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,609
Loving it maybe just
a little too much?

560
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,478
Dee, come on. You know I've always dreamt
of not having to look at price tags.

561
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,171
And Rex doesn't suspect anything?

562
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,443
I mean, the watch, the earrings,
the necklace?

563
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,712
What do you tell him?
That they're all fake.

564
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,548
Come on.
Men don't know from jewelry.

565
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,725
Well, that's the truth.

566
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,326
Know what's weird?
Nobody even wants an explanation.

567
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,688
It's like I'm Santa Claus.

568
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,955
Just as long
as I keep giving them presents,

569
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,066
they can see me searing
through the sky with flying reindeer.

570
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,630
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

571
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,382
You awake?

572
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,518
Yeah.

573
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,254
I can't sleep.

574
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,058
Me too.

575
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,999
What's wrong?

576
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,399
It's just-

577
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,269
Look, I'm happy you're working,

578
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:57,181
and I'm trying to keep
some perspective on this,

579
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,925
but it's killing me that you're
the breadwinner and I'm not.

580
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,116
Baby.

581
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,388
No, I always said
that I'd protect you,

582
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:12,762
that I would hike care of you.

583
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,101
You want a massage?

584
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,711
No. You've been doing that all day.

585
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,248
Not to anyone who looks like you.

586
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,688
Yeah.

587
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,270
Hey.

588
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:04,853
I'm sorry about what happened
at the bar the other night. I mean it.

589
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,187
I love you.

590
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,195
I love you too, girl.

591
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,864
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

592
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,505
Jim.
Sam.

593
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,010
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

594
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,608
What do you think I'm doing here?

595
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,585
Well, this is embarrassing.

596
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,979
Well, I won't tell if you won't tell.

597
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,386
There's nothing to tell.
Nothing happened. I know your wife.

598
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,757
So what? She's treats you like dirt.
Don't you wanna stick it to her?

599
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,831
Not by you sticking it to me.
Now, get on out of here.

600
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,866
Go.
All right.

601
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,004
Hurry up, hurry up.
Santa's been here.

602
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,803
Come on, Mama. Come on, Daddy.

603
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,207
Hurry up, you guys.

604
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,947
Wow. Santa brought all this?

605
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,414
This is way more
than last Christmas.

606
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,814
And I thought y'all
were spoiled before.

607
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,044
Slow down there, kids.

608
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,656
Remember, Christmas is more
than just about presents.

609
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,555
Yeah, right. Happy birthday, Jesus.

610
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,889
Well, that must have been
some Christmas bonus you got.

611
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,929
Not bad.

612
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,262
But don't you think
you're working a little too hard?

613
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,597
I'm starting to see lines
on that pretty face.

614
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,037
Mama.
Don't frown, it makes it worse.

615
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,211
I'm just saying you look tired, is all.

616
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,039
Well, don't all parents
look tired on Christmas morning?

617
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,342
Now, go look under that tree
for a little box with your name on it.

618
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,110
Something very sparkly inside.
Yes, ma'am.

619
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:48,053
Look at this.

620
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,821
Your present's outside.

621
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,197
Okay.
What?

622
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,959
What are you doing? What is this?
Open your eyes.

623
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,195
Surprise.
No, you didn't.

624
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,872
I did.

625
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,169
Oh, Sam, I don't
even know what to say.

626
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,945
I mean, thank you.

627
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,643
I got something for you,

628
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,342
but, wow, next to this...

629
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,078
Oh, what the heck.

630
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:31,131
Well, 'Rex Horton.
Trainee.”

631
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,491
It's an exterminating company

632
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,934
and the money's not great,

633
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,768
but did you know there are more rats
in east Texas than in New York City?

634
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:40,965
Sexy.

635
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,611
Don't even get me started
on cockroaches.

636
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:49,209
It's real good.
No, it's gross.

637
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,012
But it's a start.

638
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,284
Now stay tuned for
your local news, weather and sports.

639
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,619
Here's Jimmy.

640
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:07,024
Well, folks, if you moved
to Texas for the cool summon..

641
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,961
Ooh, there's a bunch
of guys out there.

642
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,037
Who knew this business
had a holiday rush?

643
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,709
A lot of lonely
people this time of year.

644
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,078
No, it can't be.

645
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,839
It can't be.
What?

646
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,949
What can't it be?

647
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,918
What is it?

648
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:29,221
It's the preacher from my church.

649
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,951
He's wearing the brown sweater
the choir gave him for secret Santa.

650
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,395
I picked out that sweater.

651
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,668
I think I'm gonna be sick.

652
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,562
Are you okay?
I don't know.

653
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,135
Well, go on, then, get out of here.
But where?

654
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,965
I can't go home, and Idol auditions
aren't for another six months.

655
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,838
Baby, you can always go home.

656
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,481
As a parent, I always tell my kids-
Will you pray with me?

657
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,684
I gotta get back inside,
but you know what?

658
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:36,620
That Christian Fellowship Lodge,
it's right over there.

659
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,255
Say one for me, would you?

660
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,623
Excuse me?

661
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,356
So sorry to interrupt,

662
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,833
but I think God
wants me to tell you

663
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,835
what's going on
at that health spa across the way.

664
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,190
All right, all right, all right.

665
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,850
Hey. Hey, I made it.

666
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,996
I made it.

667
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,062
There's 20 seconds left.

668
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,734
You missed Brady's touchdown.
Brady?

669
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,561
Kid covering him
got stung by a bee.

670
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,898
Well, I'm sorry. It was my job.

671
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,335
I have a job too, Sam. I'm here.

672
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,076
All right, good game.
Hornets, come on, bring it in.

673
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,305
Bring it in.
Sam.

674
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,251
You okay?
Well, I just-

675
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,511
I can't believe
I missed Brady's touchdown.

676
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,780
Well, I'd love to say
there'll be many more,

677
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,185
but we both know I'd be lying.

678
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,222
Dee, I drove here so fast,
I almost got a ticket.

679
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,591
I swear, I'm doing everything I can to
keep it together, but it's too much.

680
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,734
So quit.
I can't.

681
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,731
Money's too good.
The house needs a new roof.

682
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:33,170
Rex is thinking about buying into
that company he's been working for.

683
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,105
I'll quit.

684
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,142
I will. I've got to.

685
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:41,312
I'm just so tired
of being tired all the time.

686
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,219
I scored a touchdown.
I scored a touchdown.

687
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,684
Brady. Oh, you got a touchdown.

688
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,322
I'm not scared of bees anymore.

689
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,458
I scored a touchdown.
I scored a touchdown.

690
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,924
Did you see me?
I did see you, yeah.

691
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,757
I can't wait.
I just can't wait for the finals.

692
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,866
I scored the winning touchdown.

693
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,992
Yeah.

694
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,135
Sam.

695
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,142
Sam, wake up, baby.

696
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,678
Sam.

697
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,474
Hm?

698
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,146
I guess I never heard the alarm.

699
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,719
I heard it way out in the garage.

700
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,888
Honey, this is nuts.

701
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,615
Last few weeks,
you've been wearing yourself out.

702
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,556
You gotta cut back on the hours.
I'm up.

703
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,525
I'm up.

704
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:40,232
Hey, have you seen Emma lately?
I haven't seen her since Christmas.

705
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,810
No, and I miss that little buttercup,
because it's so crazy around here.

706
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,312
I'll tell you what's crazy, me
sitting here bored and horny

707
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,212
while Sam's
got three rooms going.

708
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,909
Oh, well, don't go comparing
yourself to others, Tanya.

709
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,782
We all got our own strengths.

710
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,254
Though I gotta say,
Sam's been busy as popcorn.

711
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,448
Yeah.

712
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,719
Guys flying in from Germany
en private jets.

713
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,260
Guys buying her jewelry.

714
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,692
And three, three proposals.

715
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,493
That's gotta be like
some kind of record. Heh, heh.

716
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,263
I can't believe
it's almost 4:00.

717
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,401
Dang it.

718
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,597
Y'all, why is this always empty?

719
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,676
Sam, you got a new guy in 2,
and Number 4's still waiting.

720
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,643
Well, the last guy was in real estate,
and he wouldn't stop crying.

721
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,249
I'm sorry. Two seconds,
and I'll be right there.

722
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,711
Well, I'm sorry, but I gotta know.

723
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,685
What can she be doing
that we're not?

724
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,858
I mean, there's only so
many places to put things

725
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,788
and so many things
to put in them.

726
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,794
Pecan sandies with
crushed hazelnuts?

727
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,299
I can't believe you remembered.
Of course I did.

728
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,166
Your Aunt Julie used to make them
for you when you went to Alabama.

729
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,274
Amazing. My wife can't even
remember how I like my eggs.

730
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:48,636
Scrambled. With hot sauce.

731
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,539
Now, did Ruth-Ann
get that part?

732
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:53,847
What the what?

733
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,678
She wanted the princess role,
but got the funny fairy godmother.

734
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,148
Well...

735
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,557
you just tell her that the funny parts
are the ones everyone remembers.

736
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,451
Bingo.

737
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,459
Lay on down.
Yes, ma'am.

738
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,748
Brandy, you could have been killed.

739
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,890
Yeah, well, I'm just having
a hard time staying awake.

740
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,424
I can't have my favorite girl
falling asleep at the wheel.

741
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,701
Is that what I think it is?

742
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,738
It'll keep you going. Works for me.

743
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,538
Well, no offense,
but I've never even tried weed,

744
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:33,476
and I don't wanna do anything wrong
or highly illegal.

745
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:37,050
More than I'm doing right now.

746
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:41,917
Well, it's there if you need it.

747
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,122
See you next week, Brandy.

748
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,295
Looking forward to it.

749
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,141
Wake up, Mama.

750
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,779
Mama.

751
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,880
Wake up.

752
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,109
Mama.
Uh...

753
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,348
Hey. Mama's gonna turn in early.

754
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,524
Just brush your teeth
and say your prayers, okay?

755
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,590
But you can't sleep.

756
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:20,318
Tomorrow's the bake sale,
remember?

757
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,859
What?
We're raising money for the fur.

758
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,097
For the fur?
Yeah, it's a country that's in trouble.

759
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,972
Oh, you mean Darfur.

760
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,367
I guess.

761
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,201
The bake sale's a castle theme.

762
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,105
I come up with the idea.

763
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,010
Mama? Are you listening?

764
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,514
Yeah.

765
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:44,913
I'm up.

766
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:46,747
I'm up.

767
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,267
Okay, I can do this.

768
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,101
I'm a good mother.

769
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,710
This is what good mothers do.

770
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:13,874
All right.

771
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:17,609
'With the gray fondant
make castle turrets.

772
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:21,585
With the green fondant,
place pieces into the mountain

773
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,156
and with a piping-'

774
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,293
Wake up, Sam.

775
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,090
Oh, I'm tired.

776
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,168
Okay.

777
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,809
What does that say?

778
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,537
Well, what do y'all think?

779
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:16,438
Wow, Mama, it's perfect.
Wow.

780
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:19,239
You must have been up all night.
I was, but it's done.

781
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:23,316
And you can move the chocolate
drawbridge and the moat is fudge.

782
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,418
Okay, y'all get ready.

783
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,351
Hey.

784
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:31,449
You're a great mom.

785
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:35,490
Bye.

786
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:45,099
Sam, honey,
your next client's here.

787
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:47,241
He's got a flight to catch.

788
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:50,139
Hey, Sam, you okay?
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

789
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,075
All right, doll.

790
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,900
It's really a
show you won't wanna miss.

791
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:22,305
The most memorable women
of the season dish dirt

792
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,605
and tell stories
that we want to hear.

793
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,907
Sam, you look thin.
Not again.

794
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,347
You've lost weight.
Yeah? You've gained weight.

795
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,542
Samantha Dale Horton.

796
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,451
You can comment on my weight,
but I can't comment on yours?

797
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,319
Because it's rude.
Yup, it is.

798
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,055
Wait a minute, he's about
to give her the flower.

799
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,287
I say he picks the one
with the bigger chest.

800
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,726
You say that every year.

801
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,834
And I'm gonna keep saying it
until I'm wrong.

802
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:50,603
Mama, are you gonna get
more Coke?

803
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,841
What did you just say?
I want one too.

804
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,910
I'll hike a beer.
Can I please just go to the bathroom?

805
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,044
She okay, you think?

806
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,822
She gets that
from my people.

807
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:11,220
The women got bladders
the size of peas.

808
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:21,224
Hey, Brandy.

809
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,665
Hey, you gotta help me.

810
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,668
I'm out, and I'm desperate.

811
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,306
It's gonna hike me a few days.

812
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,668
My guy's out of town.

813
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:31,676
Okay, well, can't you just call him?
Or someone else, please?

814
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:34,272
I'll make it worth your while.

815
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,613
Well, darling, now we're talking.

816
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,056
Yeah, I got it.

817
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:29,396
Sample, Waiting Room 1, got it.

818
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,171
But, Mama, I don't want to.

819
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,137
Well, you're gonna have to.
That's how doctors look for stuff.

820
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,532
Like what?

821
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:38,269
I don't know, the kind of
stuff they find in your pee.

822
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,675
But I don't have to go.
You're gonna have to try.

823
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,578
I can't.
Yes, you can.

824
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,650
I can't.
I'll turn on the water.

825
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,411
That doesn't help. I can't.
Try.

826
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,612
Stop saying it! Do you hear me?
Stop it.

827
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,917
Stop saying it! Stop saying it!
Stop saying it!

828
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,186
Okay, Mama, I'll do it. I'll try.

829
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,934
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

830
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,699
I'm so sorry.

831
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,939
Mama's just having
a bad day, okay?

832
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,005
Go on out to the waiting room.
I'm gonna be right there.

833
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,807
I'm sorry.

834
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,348
I'm sorry.

835
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,907
Not tonight.

836
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,175
I just can't.

837
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,467
You okay, Brandy?

838
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:19,408
The last few weeks,
you seem kind of different.

839
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,980
Yeah, sure, baby, I'm fine.

840
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,777
You want anything special today
or just the usual?

841
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,682
No, the usual's just fine, Brandy.

842
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:31,118
Hey, remember I was telling you
that my in-laws are in town?

843
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,625
Yeah, Aline and Tim
from Chattanooga.

844
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,922
Yeah.

845
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,625
Well, anyway, they get here and-

846
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,434
You mind if we just
get this going?

847
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:45,135
A little less talking?
I guess so.

848
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,075
I got a session in here.

849
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,108
Session's over, ma'am.
Cuff them.

850
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,105
Well, her, anyway.

851
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,948
You have the right to remain silent.

852
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:00,477
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

853
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,520
Police!
Get down!

854
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:10,960
What the heck is going on here?
Y'all have been fine with us for years.

855
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,225
Yeah, one of you's been
real fine with us.

856
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,199
Listen, Jacie, we don't like this
any better than you do.

857
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:17,394
Oh, is that right?

858
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,870
We got meth labs
popping up all over town.

859
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,636
We wanna occupy ourselves with a couple
of old boys getting happy endings?

860
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,107
It's hilarious, isn't it?

861
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:29,148
You call your sergeant right now,
and you tell him to put a stop to this.

862
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,546
Yeah, and tell him Doreen says hi.

863
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:34,487
This is coming from way above him.

864
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,258
The media got here before we did.

865
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,321
We have orders to search
the premises.

866
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:41,655
Search away,
ain't gonna find nothing.

867
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,330
We got this.

868
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,163
Come on, now.
Come on.

869
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:53,602
Carry that thing, son.

870
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,107
Don't go out of bounds, cut upfield.

871
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,136
You played with him
at UT, right?

872
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,441
Yeah. He didn't used to be
contact-shy.

873
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:04,175
We interrupt this
program to bring you breaking news

874
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,581
of e police raid currently in progress
in Lareena-

875
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,017
They better have just got
Saddam Hussein.

876
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:12,625
They already got him, idiot.
Well, then the other one, then.

877
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,353
As you can see,
going on behind me right now

878
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:18,328
is a major bust of an alleged
prostitution and drug ring.

879
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:21,468
Apparently, there has been
e months-long surveillance probe

880
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,296
conducted by Mayor Summerlin.

881
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:27,031
All pert of her campaign promise
to bring law and order to Lareena.

882
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,403
Summerlin is in
a very tight re-election race

883
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,840
and no doubt
she hopes an event like this

884
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,413
will help to put her over the edge.

885
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,552
Now we can see the police are starting
to bring out some of the alleged johns.

886
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,847
The poor bastards.

887
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:43,718
Ho-ho-ho.
What, do they charge by the pound?

888
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,484
You don't have to shake
the sheets to find her.

889
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:49,994
The name of the establishment
is the Kind Touch Health Spa,

890
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,757
but locals here say
they've long known that...

891
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,697
Oh, my gosh.

892
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,498
Phil, turn that off now.

893
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,003
-becoming quite e show
for the whole neighborhood.

894
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:00,572
We'll keep you updated.

895
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:03,745
Okay, now we're talking.

896
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,207
Shut up.

897
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,109
-along with the alleged prostitutes.

898
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,215
Of course,
they will be held separately.

899
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:10,749
The big question tonight is-

900
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,251
Hey, Rex, she looks kind
of like your wife, doesn't she?

901
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,519
I said, shut up.

902
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:20,160
We do hope to hear from the mayor
end the police chief for more details.

903
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,489
They'll be holding
a press conference

904
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,690
and of course wow bring that to you
as .soon as it happens.

905
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,097
I knew it would end like this.
Dee, please.

906
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:36,538
No, you bail someone out of jail,
you get to talk.

907
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:44,218
At first, you did it to save your family,
I get that, but then it was for you.

908
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:47,277
You threw your whole life away

909
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,253
for what's on your ears
and around your neck.

910
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,594
You're home.

911
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,434
Oh, what did I do?

912
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,433
What am I supposed to say to him?

913
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,072
How am I gonna fix this?

914
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,441
I don't know.

915
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,880
Maybe some things can't be fixed.

916
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,996
Rex, I'm so sorry.

917
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,866
I know that I've really
messed things up,

918
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,437
and I'll do just about anything
to make it right.

919
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:13,835
So just look at me.

920
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,271
Talk to me.

921
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:20,746
Yell at me, swear at me, hit me,
I don't care.

922
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:40,595
All night,
I've been thinking about something.

923
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:44,164
That summer after graduation?

924
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:46,505
You and me going-

925
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:50,736
Going to the vet
to put Barney down.

926
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,712
I loved that dog too.

927
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:57,684
And we get there,

928
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:03,415
and we're sitting in the parking lot
holding that old dog between us,

929
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:08,956
petting him,
him loving the attention...

930
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:14,064
and both of us knowing
it's his last day of life.

931
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,666
And then you sang to him.

932
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:21,173
That Beatles song.

933
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,742
'In My Life.'

934
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,548
And then I-

935
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,444
I couldn't do it.

936
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,619
I couldn't go in.

937
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,951
And you took him,

938
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,146
and you carried him in...

939
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,154
and you held him...

940
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,562
till he died.

941
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,495
You did that for me.

942
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:58,840
And any time things got tough
with us, I'd think of that day,

943
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,414
and I'd think of that girl.

944
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:10,256
And now when I think of you,
it's gonna be this.

945
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:35,646
Winner of the
1999 Miss Bixby Beauty Pageant

946
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:40,014
is Samantha Dale.

947
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:50,889
Mama?

948
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:53,634
Thank you, Eric.

949
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,461
Hey, what are you doing up?

950
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,934
I heard the TV.

951
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:01,340
Well, I'm sorry I woke you.
Come here.

952
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,670
You're watching
your pageant video.

953
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,504
Yeah.

954
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:12,717
I like the part where you say
what you'd tell the president to do

955
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,388
to fix the Middle East.

956
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,083
Did you ever tell the president?

957
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,623
No.

958
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,625
Oddly enough, he decided
not to consult Miss Bixby Hills

959
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,162
about international relations.

960
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:27,699
Why are you
watching this?

961
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,563
Just revisiting a time in my life

962
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,263
when I felt like
I was doing everything right.

963
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,738
You look sad.

964
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:43,406
Do you want me to sing to you,
like you do when I'm sad?

965
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:46,587
I think if you did that,
I just might fall apart.

966
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,778
You're sweet, though.

967
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,723
Then should I go back to bed?

968
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:54,791
In a minute.

969
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:17,642
Do you think they're gonna
let me wear makeup in jail?

970
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,150
I'll try to smuggle you some.

971
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,512
Thank you for helping me.

972
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,555
I'm your friend.

973
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:27,427
I haven't been
a very good friend lately.

974
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,722
Well, friendship
isn't quid pro quo.

975
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:32,827
Wow, you are a lawyer.

976
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,903
What's your mom say about all this?

977
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:39,763
"It's the reason you have more than one kid.
So you can ditch the screw-ups.”

978
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:41,873
That sounds like your mom.

979
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:45,137
All right, let's get down
to business.

980
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:48,976
It seems this whole thing was orchestrated
by the mayor's re-election team.

981
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:52,483
They're trying to position her
as the champion of traditional values.

982
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:53,949
How did she even find out
about us?

983
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,851
Know someone by the name
of Emma Hollings?

984
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,252
Oh, my God.

985
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,655
She went
to some religious group.

986
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,262
Christian Fellowship Lodge.
That's it.

987
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:07,595
She found a lot of old people with
time on their hands and cell phones.

988
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,293
They bombarded the police with calls,
they got nowhere.

989
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:14,464
Took it to city hall, where the mayor
decided it was divine intervention.

990
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,741
I sent her there. This is all my fault.

991
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:21,143
They're looking to charge you
with felony promotion of prostitution

992
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,180
and possession of cocaine.

993
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:24,680
You're looking at two years.

994
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,451
Oh, my God.

995
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,114
Are you still using?

996
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,419
No. Never again.

997
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:34,993
I feel like dog crap.

998
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:38,028
Well, you're gonna feel agitated,
depressed.

999
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:39,928
I mean,
the works for a few months,

1000
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:44,503
and then, honestly, periodic
cravings for the 10 next years.

1001
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:49,133
Guess the first two years
will be while I'm in jail.

1002
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:50,811
Well, maybe not.

1003
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,503
I think we can use this election
to our advantage.

1004
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,341
Don't they wanna look tough
on crime?

1005
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,449
But what they want more
is publicity.

1006
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,554
The more attention that Summerlin
can get from this, the better for her.

1007
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:04,850
The more we help her,
the more likely she is to help us.

1008
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,721
And the best way to get attention is
if we have good names to give.

1009
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:09,457
Did you have any clients

1010
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,825
that were prominent members
of the community?

1011
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:17,170
Well, yeah, but I don't wanna hurt
any of those guys.

1012
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,204
Well, I can't worry about them,
I'm representing you.

1013
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,899
Besides, all the johns ever get
is a slap on the wrist.

1014
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:25,375
There's personal
and professional embarrassment,

1015
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:28,344
but they do more sleeping
on the couch than jail time.

1016
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,212
I just don't know.

1017
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,943
Well, fine.

1018
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,884
Go to jail.
Don't see your kids for two years.

1019
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:43,255
Okay, tell me what you need.
That's better.

1020
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:44,624
And what about the girls?

1021
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:48,031
Is this gonna reduce their jail time?
It might.

1022
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:51,728
I know it's a cash business and your
clients used a lot of fake names, but-

1023
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,202
Not with me, they didn't.

1024
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,241
I need some good names, Sam.

1025
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:59,537
Truckers and frat boys
ain't gonna do a thing for us.

1026
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:02,875
We need our Eliot Spitzers
and Tiger Woods.

1027
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:10,954
What about a circuit court judge?

1028
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,927
You're kidding me. Who?

1029
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:17,124
Charlie Ocko.

1030
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,527
Dark hair, 6'4',
graduated cum laude from-

1031
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,668
I know who he is.

1032
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,496
I had a crush on him for years.

1033
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,139
Well?

1034
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,840
Let's just say sometimes small things
come in big packages.

1035
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:38,082
Let's just stick
to what we can use in court, shall we?

1036
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:39,912
This is great.

1037
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:43,386
I need you to write down anyone else
you can think of.

1038
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,620
I'm gonna need a lot more paper.

1039
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:54,492
What about the cuddle guy?
Cuddle guy?

1040
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,794
Davis P. Lowell.

1041
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:59,405
Hedge fund manager, 44.
Three kids, Karen, Kathy and Keily.

1042
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:02,769
Lives right here in Lareena
and likes to be held for hours.

1043
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,677
Oh, that's kind of sweet.
Wearing only a diaper?

1044
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,711
Okay, that's less sweet.

1045
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:12,109
I don't know how it is
you do what you do.

1046
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:13,844
Well...

1047
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,990
Beats the hell out of waitressing.

1048
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,682
Klaus Kransing, 52,
oil company lobbyist.

1049
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,385
He'd fly up every Thursday
during his wife's book club.

1050
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:25,191
When he'd get all hot and bothered,
he'd speak to me in German.

1051
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:26,833
Nothing sounds sexy
in German.

1052
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:29,833
He gave her a diamond watch.
She earned it.

1053
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:32,165
I pawned it for a down payment
on Rex's Harley.

1054
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:35,740
Things any better at home, darling?
Still sleeping on the couch.

1055
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,003
We're doing our best
to hide it from the kids.

1056
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,941
That's about to get
a whole lot harder.

1057
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:41,581
Arnie Vanderbaush, 46.

1058
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,648
He's a defense contractor
from El Paso.

1059
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,614
And I think that's it.

1060
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,715
What about Jim Reed?

1061
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:52,420
What, Carol 'the bitch of Bixby Hills"
husband, Jim Reed?

1062
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,994
He came in, but I sent him home.
He's been a regular for years.

1063
01:05:56,185 --> 01:06:00,361
As much as I'd like to stick it to Carol,
please don't put him on the list.

1064
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:01,694
Okay.

1065
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:03,461
Okay.

1066
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,239
I mean, this is incredible.

1067
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:09,535
If we play this right, we're looking
at minimal time for all of you.

1068
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,939
How many names we got?

1069
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,306
Sixty-nine.

1070
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,080
That's, uh-
Appropriate?

1071
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:20,846
That's the word.
Look, I'm gonna get this formatted.

1072
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:23,819
We are gonna walk it over
to the mayor's office personally.

1073
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:27,551
And her team has already tipped
the press off. They know it's coming.

1074
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:41,472
I always knew that Sam Horton
was nothing but trash.

1075
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:48,305
You know, I got
a real common name, honey.

1076
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,110
A lot of guys around here
got my name.

1077
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:56,380
Better hope none of them
are on the list.

1078
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,390
Good morning.

1079
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,664
I heard my gynecologist
was on the list.

1080
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,265
I don't even know
what to make of that.

1081
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:09,493
Well, if my husband's on that
list, I'm gonna lake all his stuff,

1082
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,263
put it on his bass boat
and set it on fire.

1083
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:13,940
Screw that.

1084
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:18,101
Set his stuff on fire, sure,
but sell the bass boat, girl.

1085
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,541
You can get good money
for that thing.

1086
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:22,647
Ooh-whee, you're right
about that. Heh.

1087
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:25,944
Don't this remind you about what
happened in Odessa a few years ago?

1088
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:29,252
Yeah.
Heads up.

1089
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:33,816
Poor thing.

1090
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:35,222
Can you imagine?

1091
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,331
Still showing up for work,
bless her heart.

1092
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:41,502
I heard there's a lot of big shots
on that list.

1093
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,694
Businessmen, doctors, lawyers.

1094
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,637
Lawyers? Those gals must have been
really hard up for cash.

1095
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,936
Some things even a hooker
shouldn't have to do.

1096
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,945
But we don't wanna stay
at Grandma Sarah's house.

1097
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:58,584
She thinks apples
are for dessert.

1098
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,685
She makes us
go outside and play.

1099
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:02,651
Okay, kids, that's enough.

1100
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,883
You say your goodbyes to your mama.
We got a long ride ahead of us.

1101
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,493
Why can't she come with us?

1102
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:11,364
Your mama can't leave town right now.
We've been all over this, son.

1103
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,260
That's right. Listen to your daddy.
Come here.

1104
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,834
Come here. Ooh.

1105
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:17,663
I want good reports, okay?

1106
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,305
No matter what happens to me,

1107
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:22,135
I want y'all to know
that my life has been very full

1108
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:25,005
because I've brought
the three of you into the world.

1109
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:29,078
Mama, are you gonna die?

1110
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,579
No.

1111
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:32,144
No, I'm gonna be fine.

1112
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:39,216
Let's go now.
You two head for the truck.

1113
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:43,761
Help your sister into her car seat.
I want Mommy to go.

1114
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,060
Go on, baby.

1115
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:50,999
I'm right behind y'all.
Meet you at the car.

1116
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,173
I'm gonna come
out and say goodbye.

1117
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:03,016
I always thought that was
the saddest sound in the world.

1118
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:06,846
The person's zipper on their suitcase
when you're not going with them.

1119
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:13,219
My daddy used to hike business trips,
and I just hated that sound.

1120
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:19,457
I think it's better for the kids
to get away from all this talk.

1121
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:21,764
Yeah, you're right.

1122
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,529
Maybe when y'all come back,
maybe we could-

1123
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,139
Don't.

1124
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,537
Well, maybe-

1125
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:38,278
Maybe when all this is over,
we could just think about moving

1126
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,819
and starting over?

1127
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:48,090
Rex, please look at me.

1128
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,193
I can't look at you, Sam,

1129
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,403
which is real tough,

1130
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:00,101
because looking at you

1131
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,209
used to be just about
one of my favorite things to do.

1132
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:41,738
Okay.

1133
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:43,583
Bye, skunks.

1134
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,082
I'm gonna call you
like 100 times a day.

1135
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:49,222
Bye, Mommy.
Bye, Mommy.

1136
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:51,118
Bye, Mama.

1137
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,364
You hike care, Sam.

1138
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,468
You're up early.

1139
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,401
Couldn't sleep.

1140
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:42,031
Thanks for staying
with me, Mama.

1141
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:44,507
No time to be alone.

1142
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:50,045
I keep thinking I've hit bottom,
then every day it just gets lower.

1143
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,880
I been up all night, thinking I just-

1144
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,750
Well, just realizing
that I must have raised you all wrong.

1145
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:58,921
See? New low.

1146
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:02,857
I mean, I forgive you
because you're my only child,

1147
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,697
but how could you do what you did
with those men?

1148
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:08,231
For my family.

1149
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:11,230
Well, it makes my skin crawl.

1150
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:12,906
Thank God your father's dead.

1151
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:16,599
Oh, can you not completely
destroy me until I've had some coffee?

1152
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,642
Do you want some?
Sure.

1153
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:22,646
You like it strong, right?
So strong it'll walk right into my cup.

1154
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:27,545
I think your problem is
I gave you too much self-esteem.

1155
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:29,078
What the hell?

1156
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:30,313
It's true.

1157
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:34,187
You were just so pretty and bright,
I was sure you'd be Miss Texas

1158
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,556
or go to Hollywood
and marry somebody famous.

1159
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,063
I wasted my life on your father.

1160
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:41,165
I wanted better for you.

1161
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:45,599
Your father went to a hooker once.
Please do not tell me these things.

1162
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:49,298
Ever since this happened,
people think they can tell me anything.

1163
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:53,844
The check-out girl at the Save-A-Lot told
me she doesn't like to do it doggy style.

1164
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,777
Want some biscuits or something?
Sure.

1165
01:12:58,307 --> 01:12:59,718
Is it just disgusting?

1166
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:01,751
I'm picturing disgusting.

1167
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:03,287
Yeah.

1168
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,590
Yeah, sometimes it's
real disgusting.

1169
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:09,624
Oh, honey.

1170
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:13,830
But it's kind of like
an actress playing a part.

1171
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:19,296
All the attention I got back,
that was something.

1172
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:23,973
All those men,
some rich, some powerful,

1173
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,779
all treating me like I was
the best thing in their lives.

1174
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:35,086
I guess there's just a little part of me
that needed that more than I should.

1175
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,828
Anyway, now I just wish
I could crawl up in a ball

1176
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,429
and make it all go away.

1177
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,558
You and me both.

1178
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:50,834
I'd rather chew tin foil
than face the ladies at the salon.

1179
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,702
You think the paper's come yet?

1180
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,368
I'll go check.

1181
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:01,139
Sam!
There she is.

1182
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:02,838
Oh, my Lord.

1183
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:08,120
We've all heard of the hooker
with a heart of gold,

1184
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,654
but what about one
with total recall?

1185
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,053
Former beauty queen
Samantha Horton, 28,

1186
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:15,250
of Bixby Hills, Texas,
has remembered

1187
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,055
Oh, thank God.

1188
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:18,287
Oh, my God.

1189
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:20,330
-Lareena's
Kind Touch Health Spa,

1190
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,935
currently under indictment
for prostitution and drug possession.

1191
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,630
The names of 69 of her customers
have hit the papers this morning

1192
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,039
in what is already known
as the List.

1193
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:36,081
Why is this national news?
It's about sex and not about them.

1194
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,409
Tricia, beck to you.

1195
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,143
Well, folks, the
List has turned into the Line today,

1196
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:42,322
as police round up
the suspected johns

1197
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:45,822
in the .story that'.s got the whole town
and much of the country talking-

1198
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:48,790
Now, behind me, you see the
Lareena Men's Community Center

1199
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,861
where the suspects
are being processed.

1200
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,691
That's because
police headquarters

1201
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,129
simply can't handle
that kind of volume.

1202
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,133
And, as with everything connected
to this story,

1203
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,430
Ah!

1204
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,402
It brings out the crowds,
the strong reactions

1205
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:02,439
and people
looking to make some money.

1206
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:06,602
Over here, we have e group of local
entrepreneurs selling some T-shirts.

1207
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:08,509
Let's take a look
at a couple of them.

1208
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:11,116
This one has all 69 names
on the back.

1209
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:14,753
And there's another one over here
that says 'My dad went to Lareena

1210
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:18,686
and all I got was this lousy T-shirt
and a new stepdad. '

1211
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,861
Now, you'll also see
plenty of women here

1212
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:23,120
who are videotaping
the proceedings.

1213
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:25,025
You cover your face.

1214
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,565
I'm Tricia Wong, reporting.
Now back to you, Roger.

1215
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,774
Will the defendants
please rise for sentencing?

1216
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:37,767
It is my understanding

1217
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:41,038
that this sentencing
is pursuant to a plea bargain.

1218
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:42,738
And that you have waived time

1219
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:45,418
and agreed
that I can sentence you immediately.

1220
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:46,847
Yes, Your Honor.

1221
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:50,350
Sentence is as follows
for each defendant:

1222
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:54,259
Thirty days in the county jail,
a fine of $2000

1223
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:56,929
and a $100 penalty assessment.

1224
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,929
You are to be remanded immediately
to begin sentence.

1225
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:02,992
This court is adjourned.

1226
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:08,097
That's all they get
for ruining our lives?

1227
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,812
Well, you're still harlots,
and you'll always be harlots.

1228
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,676
The Lord has
given us a warm day

1229
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,114
on which I have decided
to address a subject

1230
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:23,813
that has made a great number of us
hot under the collar,

1231
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,928
a couple of whom, shockingly,
are in the ministry.

1232
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,627
Our community
and our congregation

1233
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,268
have experienced
e greet dee! of pain

1234
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:39,701
and betrayal
in these pest few months,

1235
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:43,172
and today I would like
to talk about a concept

1236
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:46,107
that many of us
have been grappling with:

1237
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,008
Forgiveness.

1238
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,754
What is forgiveness?

1239
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:58,452
Who deserves forgiveness?

1240
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,759
Are some things unforgivable?

1241
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:08,795
The Bible tells us
that forgiveness is essential for life.

1242
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:13,864
It frees us from pest wrongs
and gives us hope for the future.

1243
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:55,414
The problem is
it's just too darn quiet in here.

1244
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:59,317
It's not natural for a mother of three
to be this quiet.

1245
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:25,304
It's not good for someone
to spend this much time alone.

1246
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:29,080
I half wish
a Jehovah's Witness would stop by.

1247
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:35,045
I finally have a wish come true,
and I wish that?

1248
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:42,556
I'm gonna give
her a piece of my mind.

1249
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,389
Sweet Jesus.

1250
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:48,700
This is not gonna be pretty. I think
they're gonna beat the crap out of me.

1251
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:54,765
Sam Horton, we know you're in there.
We saw you in the window.

1252
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,069
Well...
Hey, y'all.

1253
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:00,839
How can I help you?

1254
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,777
We'd like to talk to you.

1255
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:06,348
You look like
you just came from church.

1256
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,578
So I guess you don't have
any concealed weapons.

1257
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:11,189
Anything can be a weapon
if you want it to be.

1258
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:13,785
Come on in.

1259
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,762
Okay.

1260
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:26,030
Do y'all want some crackers
or cookies or something?

1261
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:27,263
Give it up, Sam.

1262
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:30,636
We all know this isn't a social
visit, so let's get to it.

1263
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:35,541
Some of the women here have
husbands who you, well, serviced.

1264
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:39,150
And some have husbands who you didn't.
But we're all here for the same reason.

1265
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:41,048
Yes, I know why you're here.

1266
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:44,252
If you could just hear me out first.

1267
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,593
We were broke...

1268
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:52,827
Hat broke.

1269
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:56,067
And I don't know if any of y'all
have ever been there,

1270
01:19:56,258 --> 01:20:00,707
but when it happens, and you realize
there's a way to make it all go away,

1271
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,400
well, it's amazing
what you're capable of saying yes to.

1272
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,138
And I know...

1273
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:09,543
I mean, I really know
that it is no excuse,

1274
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:13,876
but, my whole life,
I just always depended on my looks,

1275
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:18,385
and I thought this was just gonna be
another one of those times.

1276
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:24,492
I really thought I was doing
the best thing for my family.

1277
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:30,493
But in the end, the very thing
I was trying to save, I lost.

1278
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:32,427
So really,

1279
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:36,097
just about the worst thing that you
could ever wish on me has happened.

1280
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:43,039
And I'm just real sorry,
from the bottom of my heart,

1281
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,184
for the pain that I caused you.

1282
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:47,182
Yeah, that was a real nice speech,

1283
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:50,219
but, frankly,
we don't give a damn about you.

1284
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:53,291
We're not here to get an apology
or to give forgiveness.

1285
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:55,483
Okay, well, then, what are you-?

1286
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,823
Why do they come to you?

1287
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:00,795
What do you do
that we don't?

1288
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:04,129
How can we make them think about
us the way they think about you?

1289
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,395
That's why you're here?

1290
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,097
Mm-hm.

1291
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:10,276
Y'all want tips?

1292
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,110
Yes.

1293
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:14,272
Oh.

1294
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:16,074
Oh, well.

1295
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:18,148
All right, then let's talk about that.

1296
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:23,952
For what it's worth, Carol,

1297
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:26,523
when Jim came to see me,
I sent him home.

1298
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,189
You did?

1299
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,790
That's in the past.

1300
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,601
Right now,
let's just focus on the present.

1301
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:39,963
Okay, um...

1302
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,446
You'll leave here today,

1303
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:53,586
tonight, your husbands won't know
what hit them.

1304
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:58,819
My God, you showed
them how to do that?

1305
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,857
They wanted me to
demonstrate everything.

1306
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,359
I went through
two bunches of bananas.

1307
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:04,859
Ugh. My feet are killing me.

1308
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,589
Then have a seat.

1309
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:13,199
And happy birthday.

1310
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:18,304
It's not till tomorrow,
but you're off then, so here.

1311
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:22,276
Tanya, thank you.
Now, grab a fork.

1312
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,972
I'm way ahead of you.

1313
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,210
Make a wish.

1314
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:32,449
When I was little,
I used to wish

1315
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:35,526
that everyone else's wishes
would come true, including mine.

1316
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:37,993
I thought it would give me
brownie points for being unselfish.

1317
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:42,134
Hm. It's Jenna's birthday too,
right?

1318
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:44,326
Yeah, her party's tomorrow.

1319
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:47,336
It's gonna be the first time
since me and Rex separated.

1320
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:49,133
That'll be tough, huh?

1321
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:54,172
Yeah, but he's doing good.

1322
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,215
You know,
his exterminating thing's going okay,

1323
01:22:57,405 --> 01:23:00,682
and he's finally getting over
that I-can't-play-football anger.

1324
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:03,981
Well, that's great.
No, actually, it's terrible.

1325
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:07,683
I mean, him going and getting
all wonderful after he left me.

1326
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:10,328
Heh. I know, right?

1327
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:13,057
It's good.

1328
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,134
We actually make great friends,

1329
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:19,464
and he's being real supportive
of me going back to school.

1330
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:23,364
He's gonna come and see me get
my six-month-clean pin next week.

1331
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:25,169
Congratulations.

1332
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,372
Well, I gotta get to class.

1333
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:37,218
Five-dollar tip.

1334
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:40,655
Not bad for a cup of coffee
and a piece of pie.

1335
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:44,296
Even though a year ago I was getting
a $1000 tip and a marriage proposal.

1336
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:46,227
Minimum wage plus
'keep the change'

1337
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:49,027
doesn't have quite the same kick,
does it?

1338
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:52,936
Hey, do you remember
how we used to say:

1339
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:55,074
'This sure beats the hell
out of waitressing'?

1340
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:57,402
Yeah.
Back then, we were just guessing.

1341
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:09,013
He's gotta be one of mine.
They're all biters.

1342
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:12,521
Could you hold him?
Oh, I'm not really good with- Okay.

1343
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:15,826
Whoo!

1344
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:19,129
Sam, I've been thinking.

1345
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,822
You did an awful thing.

1346
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:22,695
Oh, Mama, please,
not on my birthday.

1347
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:23,926
Let me finish.

1348
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,627
You did an awful thing,

1349
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:30,606
but I think maybe
I need to accept some of the blame.

1350
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:32,944
You're more than just pretty.

1351
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:35,705
Are you trying to tell me
I'm about to lose my looks?

1352
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,679
No, you got a couple years left.
Heh.

1353
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:43,117
What I'm saying is you're also smart,
capable and strong.

1354
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:45,047
You screwed up.

1355
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,658
But you cleaned up your mess
and you moved on.

1356
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:51,794
And I think maybe
I should've encouraged you

1357
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:54,262
to rely more on stuff like that,

1358
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:56,697
stuff that lasts longer than beauty.

1359
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:59,268
Thanks, Mama.

1360
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:05,701
Still doesn't mean you can slouch.

1361
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,436
Straighten up.
Yes, ma'am.

1362
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:09,706
I'll go tell them
we're ready for the cake.

1363
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:13,582
Mama.
Hey, how did you do?

1364
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,049
I won all this.

1365
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:16,654
Go get some more. Go on.

1366
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:18,688
Hey, Daddy.
Hey, sugar.

1367
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,625
So how's work?

1368
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,332
You know, waitressing.

1369
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:28,558
It is what it is.

1370
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,298
School?

1371
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:31,903
Hard.

1372
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:33,231
Scary.

1373
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,101
Exciting.

1374
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:38,401
Well, you look good.

1375
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,877
You look real good.

1376
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,917
I'm glad you're looking at me again.

1377
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:54,750
I can't believe
our baby's 4 years old.

1378
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:58,192
She sure was the best
birthday present ever.

1379
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:01,390
You know, it's good to share a birthday
with your child.

1380
01:26:01,589 --> 01:26:04,035
It keeps the day
from ever being able to get you down.

1381
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:07,467
She loved that dollhouse
you got her.

1382
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,608
She wanted a pony.

1383
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:12,738
What about you?

1384
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:15,575
What do you want?

1385
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:20,553
You know what I want.

1386
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,523
I'm taking baby steps.

1387
01:26:35,423 --> 01:26:36,959
What do you think?

1388
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:41,269
I think that's the second-best
birthday present I ever got.

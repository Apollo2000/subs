3
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:52,778
Today we are going to pretend
to be trees.

4
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:56,378
We're gonna be tall, wonderful,
green trees

5
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,916
with really long branches
and lush leaves.

6
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:01,486
So, if you'll stand up for me.

7
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:08,392
What's that noise?
Can anybody hear it?

8
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,494
- Wind.
- Wind.

9
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:18,469
And then suddenly...

10
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:21,840
there's a storm.

11
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,448
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

12
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,582
- Hey.
- Hi.

13
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:34,552
How's the house hunting going?

14
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,586
Yeah, uh, it's okay, I mean,
it's just been going on and on.

15
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:38,955
Well, take my advice,
pounce now,

16
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:40,157
market's going through the roof.

17
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,793
Yeah, we're gonna drop and see
estate agents later, so...

18
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,127
Well, don't get
left behind, Gemma.

19
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:45,429
Okay, bye.

20
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:03,347
Who did that
to the poor baby birds?

21
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:04,983
I don't know.

22
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,953
Maybe it was a cuckoo.

23
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,520
Why?

24
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:11,957
Because it needed a nest.

25
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:15,727
Why doesn't it just make
its own nest?

26
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:20,364
Because that's nature,
that's just the way things are.

27
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,335
I don't like the way things are.
They're terrible.

28
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:28,805
Well...
it's only horrible sometimes.

29
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:29,808
Molly.

30
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:33,477
- Bye, Ms. Pierce.
- Bye.

31
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:49,092
Hey there, little lady.
Come a little closer.

32
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,731
Nah-ah! Come on, Mr. Tree
wants to get to know you.

33
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:56,034
Ah, there you go. There you go.

34
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:59,805
My bark.

35
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:07,946
- Hey.
- Hi.

36
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:10,847
Mm. So, how am I
at the tree game?

37
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,818
- Yeah, you're pretty mediocre.
- That's good.

38
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:16,420
Sad little things.

39
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:17,956
It's cruel.

40
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,096
Okay, there you go.

41
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,046
Hey, come on.
Show some respect.

42
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:45,115
- Did you knock them down?
- No, I did not knock them down.

43
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,783
I am a professional.
Come on. How dare you?

44
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,752
- Professional weirdo.
- Yeah, but professional.

45
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:51,587
Professional.

46
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:53,790
I'm gonna get
my own wheels one day.

47
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:56,226
Just you wait, I'm gonna have,
like, a big, you know,

48
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,694
muddy gardener's van.

49
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:59,131
- Sounds delightful.
- Yeah.

50
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,465
Are you gonna change
your T-shirt?

51
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,434
- What?
- Your T-shirt.

52
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,268
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

53
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,705
- Shit.
- You stink.

54
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:32,028
Yo, seriously. Your mom,
she's the worst offender, too.

55
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,163
She's hardly over there.

56
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:34,130
She's there all the time.

57
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:35,865
Well, she came
with the apartment.

58
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,769
Yeah.

59
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,179
Hello.

60
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:48,814
We're just, um...

61
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,947
- looking...
- Yeah.

62
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,516
- ...for something...
- And you are?

63
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,054
I'm Gemma.
This is my boyfriend, Tom.

64
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:58,056
Hey, what's up?

65
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,794
Gemma and Tom,
lovely to meet you.

66
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:06,530
It's lovely to meet you too,
Martin.

67
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,001
Yonder
is a wonderful development.

68
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,136
Both tranquil and practical,

69
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:15,707
it has all you'd need
and all you'd want.

70
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,275
And as for the prices,

71
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,677
it's no wonder these houses
are getting snapped up.

72
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,083
I know what you guys
are thinking.

73
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,152
Suburbia.

74
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:31,721
But there's more to Yonder than
what you see in these images.

75
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:33,025
We've lovely people,

76
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,827
all sorts of people
ready to move in.

77
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,830
It's going to be
a diverse community.

78
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:41,599
Something different,
a nice blend.

79
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,769
Where's it located?

80
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:45,604
Near enough.

81
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:48,140
And far enough.

82
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,642
Just the right distance.

83
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,777
We could
take a look if you like.

84
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,614
- Hmm.
- Do you have a vehicle?

85
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,750
- Ah, shit. Unfortunately...
- Yes, we do, outside.

86
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:02,287
Good. I'll get my keys.
You can follow me.

87
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,127
We could arrange an appointment
at a later date if you'd prefer.

88
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:11,861
But like I said, homes at Yonder

89
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,765
may not be available
for much longer.

90
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:16,666
- All right.
- It's not exactly

91
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:19,304
what we're looking for,
but, um...

92
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:22,007
- I suppose it's...
- Worth a look?

93
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,211
Good. We're all happy, then.

94
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:31,181
Jesus.

95
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:33,685
Martin, you are one strange
and persuasive motherfucker.

96
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:34,951
- Oh.
- Ready.

97
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:36,321
- Yeah, ready, yeah.
- Ready.

Let's get this over with.

114
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,157
Okay.

115
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,833
- Welcome to Yonder.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:31,436
Number nine.

117
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:51,723
Many homes have the pretense
of being ideal.

118
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,726
But these homes
really are ideal.

119
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:57,963
Please go through.

120
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:05,068
Toasty.

121
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,404
- It's...
- Yeah.

122
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:08,073
Oh.

123
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:12,811
The living room.
A room to live in.

124
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:16,181
Memories will be made
in the ample spaces

125
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:18,516
between these walls.

126
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:21,217
Come.

127
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:24,587
It's good, it's good.

128
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:27,092
I love it.
I love the single hue.

129
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:38,436
A welcome tipple.

130
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,939
- I'm... I'm driving.
- Mm.

131
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,277
- Perhaps a strawberry.
- Oh, no. I'm... I'm driving.

132
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:00,525
Blue for a boy.

133
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,128
You've got it all worked out.

134
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,031
Number nine
is not a starter home.

135
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:09,198
- This house is forever.
- Hmm.

136
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,303
A perfect environment
for a young family.

137
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,306
Do you have children?

138
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:16,041
No. Not yet.

139
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,976
No. Not yet.

140
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,221
The master bedroom.

141
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:32,490
Yeah.

142
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,828
If you follow me
to the back garden.

143
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:38,963
A haven of nature.

144
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,249
It's good, it's nice here.

145
00:11:58,483 --> 00:11:59,584
- Yeah.
- If you wanna...

146
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,520
live here, it's a lot of space.

147
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,998
So, when're people due
to move in?

148
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,373
Huh?

149
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,610
Martin?

150
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,212
Martin?

151
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:35,186
Hello?

152
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:38,123
Nope.

153
00:12:46,998 --> 00:12:48,266
- His car's gone.
- Huh?

154
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,634
His car's gone.

155
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,537
Good. Now,
let's get the fuck out of here.

156
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:06,518
Okie dokes.

157
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:28,173
Buh-bye.

158
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,647
- That guy was so strange.
- Yeah.

159
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,582
Wait. No, no, I don't think
this is the right way.

160
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,717
Yeah, this is the way
we came in.

161
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,086
No, is it?

162
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:44,155
Yeah.

163
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:51,196
Wait.

164
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:52,729
What? You think
it was back there?

165
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,866
Yeah, I think it was back there.

166
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,337
Let me just see
what's around here, though.

167
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:09,514
Number nine again.

168
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,347
Did we just do
some kind of loop?

169
00:14:11,349 --> 00:14:12,250
What the fuck?

170
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:16,488
Wait, did we...
Did we leave the door open?

171
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,727
How've we just...

172
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:36,742
You want me to drive?

173
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,143
- No, I'm good.
- Yeah? You're good?

174
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:43,381
'Cause I think we're literally
going in a circle.

175
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:51,289
Tom.

176
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,792
All right.

177
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,694
Give me the wheel.

178
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:57,295
What?

179
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:00,231
What difference
is that gonna make?

180
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,565
Okay. Come on. Give me a go.

181
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,767
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.

182
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,468
- You wanna go on the car?
- Yeah.

183
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,403
- What are you? Six?
- Yeah, I'm six.

184
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:09,675
Come on, just move over.

185
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,711
Fine.

186
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,114
I'll give you a go.

187
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,516
A little go of the car.

188
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:22,053
Okay. Let's go.

189
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,768
Do you have your phone?

190
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,201
Yeah.

191
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,403
Anything?

192
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:42,473
No, there's no coverage
on either of them.

193
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,109
Great.

194
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,220
- Tom.
- What?

195
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,657
Number fucking nine again.

196
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:04,495
- Hmm.
- Fuck this.

197
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:09,233
Ooh, you're not doing that
in my car.

198
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,170
I'm opening the window.

199
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:14,272
You're such a jerk.

200
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:16,240
One second, I'm stressed.

201
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:25,851
Okay, let's go. Thank you.

202
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:36,227
Number nine.

203
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:38,762
Why the fuck do we keep seeing
number nine?

204
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,198
I haven't seen a single car.
There's nobody here.

205
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:42,799
- <i>If I see another row...</i>
- <i>Okay, who the fuck...</i>

206
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,466
- <i>...of green houses...</i>
- <i>...would live in this place?</i>

207
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:43,501
<i>...I'm gonna lose my mind.</i>

208
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:45,570
<i>This shit is not possible,
okay?</i>

209
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,336
- <i>It's not possible.</i>
- <i>We got in here...</i>

210
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:51,675
<i>Tom, we have gone this way.</i>

211
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,509
- <i>I have gone this way that's...</i>
- <i>All right, no, no, just...</i>

212
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,378
- <i>Just let me figure this out...</i>
- <i>...where you took the wheel.</i>

213
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:57,981
<i>Please,
can you just listen to me once</i>

214
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:58,884
I think we should take a left.

215
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:01,283
- I know what I'm doing.
- You've done this, like,

216
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:02,418
- five or six times now.
- I know what I'm doing.

217
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,723
I know what I'm doing.

218
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,693
It just goes on
and on and on.

219
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,785
It's empty.

220
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:35,520
Oh, my God.

221
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,949
Hello?

222
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,623
Hello!

223
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:28,674
Let's go inside.

224
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:07,713
No taste.

225
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,665
I've never heard such silence.

226
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,468
Well...

227
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,014
Come here.

228
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,918
All right.
Hold the base with your foot.

229
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,925
Be careful.

230
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,460
Okay.

231
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,056
Well, what do you see?

232
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,463
Tom, what do you see?

233
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,534
Hey, maybe...
Maybe we should follow the sun.

234
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,736
We'll...
We'll cut through gardens,

235
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,907
we'll jump over fences, what...
Whatever it takes, all right?

236
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,109
We're...
We're gonna get out of here.

237
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,754
Are you okay?

238
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,493
Yeah.

239
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,769
I... I've gotta stop.
I've gotta stop.

240
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,111
- Tom, there's a light.
- A light?

241
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:27,545
There's a light.

242
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,952
- Holy shit.
- Hello?

243
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:36,955
Hello.

244
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,228
Hello?

245
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,133
What's happening?

246
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,082
What the fuck?

247
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,525
Come back!

248
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,295
Come back!

249
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,234
Come back!

250
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,876
<i>Hey!</i>

251
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,177
<i>Hey!</i>

252
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,112
<i>Come back!</i>

253
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:58,970
What have you done?

254
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,073
I'm sending out a smoke signal.

255
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,388
Oh, my God.

256
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,010
Hi.

257
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,219
It's a boy.

258
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:21,940
Someone must be watching.

259
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,576
There must be
someway out of here,

260
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,011
everywhere has a way out.

261
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,082
<i>Yeah, well, maybe, Gemma,</i>

262
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,318
if you didn't say no to every
other goddamn house

263
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,355
we looked at,
we wouldn't have ended up here.

264
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,988
So, I'm to blame?

265
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,890
How is this my fault, Tom?

266
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:44,160
I'm sorry, Gem, it's just
this place is making me crazy.

267
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,532
The food here
makes me feel sick.

268
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,376
Creepy little mutant.

269
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,080
Measure me.
Measure me, measure me.

270
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,063
Am I bigger today?

271
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,532
Yes. You're bigger today.

272
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,901
I grow fast as a dog.

273
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,569
That's right.

274
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:26,338
What is a dog?

275
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,172
We already told you
what a dog is.

276
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,877
- Woof, woof, woof!
- Yes. Woof, woof, woof, woof.

277
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,197
Are you overwhelmed again,
Mother?

278
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,466
I am not your mother.

279
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,501
Who is my mother?

280
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,304
God knows.

281
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,174
Dog knows. Dog knows.

282
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,204
Yum yum.

283
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,630
I don't know
why we do this.

284
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,096
They never seem to come
when we're waiting

285
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,467
to bash their brains out
with a pick.

286
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,236
- It's futile.
- Yeah.

287
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,805
Like putting an SOS on the roof

288
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,642
when planes never seem
to pass, right?

289
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,245
Yep.

290
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:58,657
Watching.

291
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:04,529
That boy is always watching.

292
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,065
That's not a boy.

293
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:12,403
Coffee?

294
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,140
Yeah, sure.

295
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,626
This is just pointless,
it's just weird muck.

296
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:50,836
The box is gone.

297
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,888
Did you... Did you move the box?

298
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:12,455
- Tell me.
- Where're the roots?

299
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,290
- Tom.
- Where's the subsoil?

300
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,759
- Where's anything?
- It's gone.

301
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,662
I was right here.

302
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:18,631
I was standing right here.
I was looking at the road.

303
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,264
Tom.

304
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:22,133
Tom.

305
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,767
- Stop!
- Gemma, please,

306
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,236
just let me dig, okay?

307
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,906
This is something I can do,
please just let me do this.

308
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,641
You were digging all day.

309
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:05,476
- All day, Tom.
- Yeah.

310
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:08,614
Why?

311
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,483
It's got to have a bottom.

312
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,619
It's gotta... It's gotta lead

313
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:16,822
- to somewhere.
- Where?

314
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,523
I don't know.

315
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,661
Australia.

316
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:24,930
Yeah, baby.

317
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,532
Or hell.

318
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:28,767
No.

319
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,435
No, we're already there.

320
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,714
All right,
I'm gonna head back out.

321
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:51,882
Oh, well, wait for me,
I'll come with you.

322
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:54,285
No, you know what? We only
got the... the one spade.

323
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,988
Well, I could use the pick.

324
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,024
You know, it kinda comes off
in clumps now. But, thanks.

325
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:33,645
It's like a smell in this car.

326
00:38:35,948 --> 00:38:39,051
It's not bad, it's just like...
It's like a real smell.

327
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,051
- Have you noticed that?
- Yeah.

328
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:42,054
Yeah.

329
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,056
I like it. I've just been...

330
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:47,059
breathing it in...

331
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,528
pretending that I'm home.

332
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,541
The battery's still good, Jesus.

Tom.

357
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,185
Tom, you okay?

358
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,322
Tom!

359
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:00,725
Are you all right?

360
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,200
Let me see.

361
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:12,337
Are you okay?

362
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,819
We can't be with you
all the time.

363
00:41:29,121 --> 00:41:30,989
People like to be alone
sometimes, okay?

364
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:35,360
Do you understand?

365
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,800
Not being with each other
all the time.

366
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,373
Forget it.

367
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,283
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mother.

368
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,387
I'm not your mother.

369
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,197
What the fuck?

370
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,367
What do you want? We fed you.

371
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,301
What do you want?

372
00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:21,673
Jesus! Say what you want.
What do you want?

373
00:42:22,474 --> 00:42:24,442
Shut up. Shut up!

374
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:27,810
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

375
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,115
Gemma, please,
just let me do this, okay?

376
00:42:32,117 --> 00:42:35,086
This is something I can do, just
please, Gemma, let me do this.

377
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:36,755
You're fucking disgusting.

378
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:38,323
Please, Gemma, just please.

379
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:39,791
Do you know that?

380
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:41,193
Just please let me do this.

381
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:43,126
- This is something I can do...
- You're fucking disgusting!

382
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:44,062
...please, Gemma, let me do...

383
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,391
Sorry.

384
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:57,469
It's okay.

385
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,943
I am fucking
disgusting, you know that?

386
00:44:39,311 --> 00:44:41,179
I am fucking disgusting.

387
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:14,946
Are you gonna dig today?

388
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,483
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

389
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:22,354
Do you feel like
you're making progress?

390
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:25,423
Yeah.

391
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,493
Yeah. So, I'm gonna, um...
I'm gonna get back to it.

392
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:29,994
Thanks.

393
00:46:33,425 --> 00:46:34,590

00:46:35,728 --> 00:46:36,993

- <i>go to bed.</i>
- <i>Stop!</i>

00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:41,433
<i>Stop.</i>

400
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:14,532
Gemma.

401
00:47:16,769 --> 00:47:17,636
No.

402
00:47:18,604 --> 00:47:19,603
On.

403
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:21,005
- No.
- On.

404
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:22,106
No.

405
00:47:28,747 --> 00:47:30,346
What am I supposed to do
with him?

406
00:47:36,655 --> 00:47:37,555
Whatever.

407
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,227
Whatever.

408
00:48:10,723 --> 00:48:13,322
What are you doing?

409
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,159
Tom!

410
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:17,493
I'm locking it up.

411
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:18,596
I'm gonna starve it.

412
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:22,066
- Tom. Tom.
- Gemma, stay!

413
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,283
All right. Get in. Come on.

414
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:42,485
Give me the key.

415
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:44,153
- No, no. Get back in the house.
- Give me the key!

416
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:45,789
- Get back in the house!
- Tom. Tom!

417
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:49,460
- Gemma, come on.
- Tom, give me the key!

418
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:55,131
I am not looking after it, okay?

419
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,465
You will leave it there,
don't play with it,

420
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,167
don't feed it, don't have
anything to do with it.

421
00:48:58,169 --> 00:48:59,569
- You will let it starve.
- Let me up!

422
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:01,672
Look, it has you acting
like you're its fucking mother,

423
00:49:01,674 --> 00:49:03,339
okay, you're... You're putting it
to bed at night,

424
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:04,507
you're telling it
not to watch cartoons.

425
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:06,812
Tom, let me up!

426
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,626
Look, I'm sorry, but I...
I will not let you help it.

427
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:24,095
Okay. If they don't want it
to die, they'll come for it.

428
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,200
It's up to them.

429
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:42,547
What if they don't come?

430
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,381
What are we supposed to do?

431
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,585
Do we just sit here
and we wait for him to die?

432
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:50,388
- It.
- What?

433
00:49:50,756 --> 00:49:52,791
It. Not him.

434
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:55,493
Stop saying him.

435
00:49:58,797 --> 00:50:01,299
If it dies,
maybe they'll let us go.

436
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:17,816
Hey.

437
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,250
Hey, it's okay.

438
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:22,888
He's not gonna hurt you,
I promise.

439
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:25,390
You can come out.

440
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,631
I'm sorry.

441
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:17,442
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

442
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:19,444
<i>I can hear you.</i>

443
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:21,379
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

444
00:51:24,616 --> 00:51:25,617
<i>I can hear you.</i>

445
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:28,519
He'll get tired soon.

446
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:31,456
And he'll go to sleep.

447
00:51:34,693 --> 00:51:36,294
You should go to sleep, too.

448
00:51:36,995 --> 00:51:37,996
Have a dream.

449
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:41,700
What's a dream?

450
00:51:44,036 --> 00:51:45,236
It's, um...

451
00:51:47,072 --> 00:51:51,808
It's like all sorts of moving
pictures in your mind,

452
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,444
but no one else can see them.

453
00:51:54,012 --> 00:51:55,580
I've never had a dream.

454
00:51:56,514 --> 00:51:57,515
Well...

455
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:00,919
close your eyes and try.

456
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,595
<i>Whoever's on the other side,</i>

457
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:15,399
<i>can you hear me?
I know you can hear me.</i>

458
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,878
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

459
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:28,847
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

460
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,481
<i>What lovely sky we have.</i>

461
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:15,051
<i>It is lovely to live
under a lovely sky</i>

462
00:54:15,053 --> 00:54:18,891
and a lovely house with
lovely houses all around us.

463
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,862
You are such a mystery.

464
00:54:27,132 --> 00:54:29,601
You're a mystery
and I'm gonna solve you.

465
00:54:31,136 --> 00:54:33,872
I'm a mystery. I'm a mystery.

466
00:54:37,142 --> 00:54:38,507
Do you see that cloud?

467
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:40,078
What's that cloud
in the shape of?

468
00:54:40,712 --> 00:54:41,713
A cloud.

469
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,481
That's right.

470
00:54:46,218 --> 00:54:47,185
Do you see that other cloud?

471
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:49,719
Yes.

472
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:51,555
What's that cloud
in the shape of?

473
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:53,892
- A cloud.
- Yes.

474
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:56,628
Another cloud-shaped cloud.

475
00:54:57,029 --> 00:54:59,563
All the clouds here
are shaped like clouds.

476
00:55:00,132 --> 00:55:02,566
Perfect, sickening...

477
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,103
little clouds.

478
00:55:06,772 --> 00:55:08,006
Do you like clouds?

479
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:09,775
Where I come from...

480
00:55:11,243 --> 00:55:13,910
clouds come in all shapes
and sizes,

481
00:55:13,912 --> 00:55:15,979
some of them look like faces

482
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:18,582
and some of them look
like dogs.

483
00:55:19,151 --> 00:55:20,518
Woof, woof!

484
00:58:11,156 --> 00:58:12,657
Did you see the boy?

485
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:14,993
No.

486
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,898
- He's gone missing.
- Well...

487
00:58:20,866 --> 00:58:22,134
so have we.

488
00:58:34,846 --> 00:58:38,250
<i>Hello!</i>

489
00:58:41,253 --> 00:58:44,422
Where are you?

490
00:59:06,878 --> 00:59:07,944
Where did you go?

491
01:00:34,532 --> 01:00:35,767
Where were you today?

492
01:00:36,835 --> 01:00:38,403
I'm solving a mystery.

493
01:00:39,037 --> 01:00:40,038
Really?

494
01:00:40,872 --> 01:00:41,973
What did you discover?

495
01:00:42,307 --> 01:00:43,308
Lots.

496
01:00:44,209 --> 01:00:46,411
Lots? Like what?

497
01:00:47,112 --> 01:00:48,313
Lots and lots.

498
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:51,549
Did you meet anyone when
you were solving the mystery?

499
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:53,818
I met you when I was finished.

500
01:00:57,322 --> 01:00:58,490
Did you meet anyone else?

501
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:01,526
Anyone you've never met before?

502
01:01:06,298 --> 01:01:07,299
Who?

503
01:01:10,368 --> 01:01:11,870
I'm not allowed to say.

504
01:01:28,987 --> 01:01:29,988
Let's play a game.

505
01:01:31,456 --> 01:01:32,891
Let's play pretend.

506
01:01:38,163 --> 01:01:39,164
Pretend to be me.

507
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:43,234
Whatever.

508
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,505
Can you pretend to be Tom?

509
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:53,845
Gemma, stay!

510
01:01:56,481 --> 01:01:58,516
- Will I do a dog?
- Yes, please.

511
01:02:03,288 --> 01:02:05,290
Is there anyone else you can do?

512
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:10,462
Someone you met today?

513
01:02:13,164 --> 01:02:14,399
Pretend to be that person.

514
01:02:44,295 --> 01:02:47,298
Are you overwhelmed again,
Mother?

515
01:02:48,566 --> 01:02:50,935
I am not your mother.

516
01:02:52,705 --> 01:02:54,305
Are you overwhelmed?

517
01:02:55,407 --> 01:02:59,411
I want... to go home.

518
01:03:01,747 --> 01:03:04,249
Silly Mother, you are home.

519
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:31,644
Thanks.

520
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,511
You're welcome.

521
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,681
Do you mean that?

522
01:03:37,616 --> 01:03:41,319
Or is that sarcasm?
Are you being sarcastic?

523
01:03:43,221 --> 01:03:44,222
No.

524
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:48,026
But you don't really mean
that I'm welcome, right?

525
01:03:49,227 --> 01:03:50,228
I was being polite.

526
01:03:51,463 --> 01:03:53,498
Why are you being polite?

527
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:57,368
Is it fear?

528
01:04:00,038 --> 01:04:01,039
Probably.

529
01:04:16,387 --> 01:04:17,388
Probably.

530
01:05:00,098 --> 01:05:01,266
You need to eat something.

531
01:05:03,334 --> 01:05:04,335
I'll try.

532
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:21,319
Thank you.

533
01:05:28,393 --> 01:05:29,394
What's wrong?

534
01:05:37,636 --> 01:05:40,739
Why didn't I let you kill him
when he was young?

535
01:05:46,244 --> 01:05:48,179
Because you're a...
you're a good person.

536
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:17,810
Thanks.

537
01:06:28,553 --> 01:06:30,288
You like playing this game,
don't you?

538
01:10:14,412 --> 01:10:17,513
Tom!

539
01:10:17,515 --> 01:10:19,117
Gemma.

540
01:10:22,888 --> 01:10:24,623
<i>Tom!</i>

541
01:10:26,825 --> 01:10:28,894
Gemma!

542
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:37,102
<i>Tom!</i>

543
01:10:37,501 --> 01:10:39,836
Gemma!

544
01:10:42,107 --> 01:10:43,642
<i>Gemma!</i>

545
01:10:46,778 --> 01:10:49,047
Tom!

546
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:57,122
Gem...

547
01:10:58,991 --> 01:10:59,992
Gem...

548
01:11:05,731 --> 01:11:06,732
Tom.

549
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:09,801
Tom.

550
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:17,976
Tom.

551
01:11:18,576 --> 01:11:20,612
Hi.

552
01:11:25,918 --> 01:11:26,919
It's locked.

553
01:11:38,897 --> 01:11:42,167
Hey, open the door!

554
01:11:43,235 --> 01:11:44,169
Let us in.

555
01:11:46,504 --> 01:11:48,707
Open! Open the door!

556
01:11:49,775 --> 01:11:51,076
Open the door!

557
01:12:11,763 --> 01:12:12,764
Tom.

558
01:12:16,068 --> 01:12:17,069
Tom.

559
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:22,941
Tom.

560
01:12:23,809 --> 01:12:24,810
Shit.

561
01:12:32,918 --> 01:12:33,885
Please.

562
01:12:34,853 --> 01:12:37,089
Please, please, please.
You need to help us,

563
01:12:37,322 --> 01:12:39,091
'cause he's getting sicker
and sicker.

564
01:12:40,192 --> 01:12:41,827
Please, you can't leave him
this way.

565
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:46,530
You know, maybe it's time
he was released.

566
01:14:12,284 --> 01:14:13,285
Do you remember...

567
01:14:14,886 --> 01:14:15,887
the wind...

568
01:14:16,888 --> 01:14:17,823
Gemma?

569
01:14:19,357 --> 01:14:20,659
Before we got here.

570
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:24,830
Yeah.

571
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,631
The wind was great.

572
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:29,968
I never realized
how much I liked it.

573
01:14:51,123 --> 01:14:52,958
I'm glad that guy stood you up.

574
01:14:55,026 --> 01:14:57,129
You looked so glum.

575
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:00,230
I didn't know if it was okay

576
01:15:00,232 --> 01:15:02,134
for me to go over
and, like, talk to you.

577
01:15:04,169 --> 01:15:06,271
You looked so glum, so cute.

578
01:15:07,939 --> 01:15:10,008
I can't even remember
what I said.

579
01:15:10,408 --> 01:15:12,978
You didn't say anything,
you just...

580
01:15:14,746 --> 01:15:15,847
stood next to me.

581
01:15:16,281 --> 01:15:17,349
Oh, shit.

582
01:15:18,783 --> 01:15:19,784
That's creepy.

583
01:15:25,757 --> 01:15:27,425
You told me I looked like
I needed a drink.

584
01:15:29,461 --> 01:15:31,029
- You did.
- Mm-hmm.

585
01:15:32,731 --> 01:15:34,964
You said I looked like
I needed one too.

586
01:15:34,966 --> 01:15:35,967
Mm.

587
01:15:38,203 --> 01:15:39,371
And then I can't...

588
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:44,242
I can't remember what happened
after that.

589
01:15:45,177 --> 01:15:46,178
I guess we drank.

590
01:15:47,012 --> 01:15:48,013
Yeah.

591
01:15:49,114 --> 01:15:50,115
We drank and...

592
01:15:51,183 --> 01:15:52,150
we drank.

593
01:15:57,989 --> 01:15:58,990
Tom.

594
01:16:04,863 --> 01:16:07,933
Tom... what happened then?

595
01:16:11,236 --> 01:16:12,237
Then I...

596
01:16:13,805 --> 01:16:15,106
I must have fallen over...

597
01:16:16,308 --> 01:16:18,810
and woken up on...
on your couch.

598
01:16:21,413 --> 01:16:24,182
The sun was in my eyes,
I couldn't see anything.

599
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:26,851
I didn't know where I was.

600
01:16:32,557 --> 01:16:34,326
You looked like you came
out of the sun.

601
01:16:37,262 --> 01:16:38,964
I could just
see your silhouette.

602
01:16:41,132 --> 01:16:43,101
And then when I...
I finally saw you...

603
01:16:44,836 --> 01:16:46,137
I realized where I was.

604
01:16:48,506 --> 01:16:49,908
And then you spoke to me.

605
01:16:52,277 --> 01:16:53,278
What did I say?

606
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:01,219
You asked me if I wanted
some scrambled eggs.

607
01:17:04,422 --> 01:17:05,423
And?

608
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,292
And that was that.

609
01:17:13,365 --> 01:17:14,366
Yeah.

610
01:17:16,868 --> 01:17:17,869
That was that.

611
01:17:24,843 --> 01:17:26,444
I kinda felt like I was home...

612
01:17:31,483 --> 01:17:32,484
because of you.

613
01:17:37,255 --> 01:17:39,190
I'm... I'm home right now.

614
01:17:50,869 --> 01:17:51,870
Tom?

615
01:17:54,205 --> 01:17:55,206
Tom?

616
01:18:00,245 --> 01:18:01,246
Tom?

617
01:18:06,117 --> 01:18:07,252
Tom?

618
01:18:19,497 --> 01:18:20,498
Tom?

619
01:25:42,941 --> 01:25:43,942
<i>What am I?</i>

620
01:25:45,911 --> 01:25:47,045
<i>What is this?</i>

621
01:25:49,547 --> 01:25:51,049
<i>What am I in this?</i>

622
01:25:53,652 --> 01:25:54,920
<i>You are a mother.</i>

623
01:25:56,054 --> 01:25:58,322
- <i>A mother?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

624
01:25:59,091 --> 01:26:01,727
<i>Someone who prepares her son
for the world.</i>

625
01:26:03,762 --> 01:26:06,799
<i>What does a mother
do then?</i>

626
01:26:09,567 --> 01:26:10,568
<i>She dies.</i>

627
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:14,572
You go to sleep now.

628
01:26:15,573 --> 01:26:16,775
Have a nice dream.

629
01:26:17,508 --> 01:26:18,877
All we wanted...

630
01:26:20,712 --> 01:26:22,413
was a home.

631
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:23,882
Silly Mother.

632
01:26:25,684 --> 01:26:26,685
You are home.

633
01:26:33,091 --> 01:26:35,426
I'm not your fucking mother.

634
01:26:36,527 --> 01:26:37,528
Pardon?

635
01:26:38,697 --> 01:26:39,798
I said...

636
01:26:40,933 --> 01:26:44,736
I am not your fucking mother.

637
01:26:55,914 --> 01:26:56,915

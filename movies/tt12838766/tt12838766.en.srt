2
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,043
Sorry, but I'm a little short.

3
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,088
This is real rice. It's gotta be worth
something. Should have tried...

4
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,006
Damn it! Stupid asshole!

5
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,883
The translator is malfunctioning again.

6
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,806
You always run out of money
when you come here.

7
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,309
Ah, come on, guys.
Okay, okay. Just wait a s…

8
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,979
I just wanna take a quick look.
That's all. Is it really so hard?

9
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,302
- Come on! You guys make me pay…
- There's nothing to see!

10
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,994
If it was her, you'd get an alert!

11
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:34,028
How would you know, huh? Let me go!
Hey, hey! Just let me in this one time!

12
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,280
That's enough.

13
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,780
Let him in.

14
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,162
But this won't satisfy me.
Your magnetic boots are cool.

15
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,249
I found them yesterday.
Fixed them up myself, you know?

16
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,376
I was the only one on my ship
without a pair...

17
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,499
Take them off.

18
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,884
Space shuttle crash.
Five days ago in the Kubuqi Desert.

19
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,303
Body was in a burnt-out escape capsule.

20
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,339
It matches the description.

21
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,187
Female, seven years old.

22
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,022
But…

23
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,612
I told you it wasn't her.

24
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,782
You're not gonna find her here on Earth.

25
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,869
I think she's already drifted too far.

26
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,664
You have money for the transit, Tae-ho?

27
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,710
Poor guy.

28
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,394
<i>Hope was extinct.</i>

29
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,690
<i>The Earth was still breathing,
but it was on life support.</i>

30
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,808
<i>With Earth no longer habitable,
the only place left to go was up.</i>

31
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,365
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

32
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,536
<i>we have just entered
UTS-governed interplanetary space.</i>

33
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,372
<i>Welcome to the orbit.</i>

34
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,201
<i>Earth used to be
the symbol of life.</i>

35
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,580
<i>Space, death.</i>

36
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,874
<i>Now, through the miracle of technology,</i>

37
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,501
<i>we can go fishing
in a stream above the sky.</i>

38
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,964
<i>Children are again able to chase
butterflies in vast green fields.</i>

39
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,092
<i>This is only the beginning for UTS.</i>

40
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,887
<i>You all know the voice.</i>

41
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,431
Now you will be meeting the man himself.

42
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,684
Doctor, physicist,
aerospace engineer, historian.

43
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,103
He's the wealthiest man in the world,

44
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,191
as well as the oldest at 152 years old.

45
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:02,570
Ladies and gentlemen, let me
introduce you to the founder of UTS,

46
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:07,742
the creator of our celestial paradise,
the savior of humanity,

47
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,079
Mr. James Sullivan.

48
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,592
Mr… Mr. Sullivan.

49
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,761
The reporters from Earth are here.

50
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,179
Ah.

51
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,811
Hi.

52
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:42,485
This is genetically-modified
<i>Schefflera arboricola</i>.

53
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,822
Produces eight times more oxygen
than unmodified strains.

54
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,521
It's been responding rather well
to natural fertilizer.

55
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,535
The growth rate is phenomenal.

56
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:55,206
This soil came from the surface of Mars.

57
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,250
Can you believe that?

58
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,794
Welcome.

59
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,178
Only kidding. Please, please.

60
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,764
As you are all aware,

61
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,770
at UTS, we have been carefully
cultivating life on Mars

62
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,567
using the tree of life, the Super Plant.

63
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,695
Now, in three days' time…

64
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,782
…when Mars is at its closest point
to the orbit,

65
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,870
we will be announcing
the grand opening of the new Mars colony.

66
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,415
This?

67
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,750
This isn't dirty.

68
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,963
Human beings are dirty.

69
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,175
Their crimes against nature are.

70
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,680
Which, I assure you,
there will be none of in our new Eden.

71
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,641
There's something else
that won't be in your new Eden.

72
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,519
Ninety-five percent
of the human population.

73
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:03,232
They're still living on Earth,
which has long turned into a living hell.

74
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,944
What about the people left behind?

75
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,572
Or the space laborers from Earth?

76
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,910
There is a humanitarian crisis
unfolding before our eyes.

77
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,649
The purpose of today's press conference...

78
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,954
No, no, it's… He's right.

79
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,585
This is indeed a crisis which,
as a company, we will be addressing.

80
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,087
Space is full of trash.

81
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,215
Expired satellites,
abandoned space vehicles,

82
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,550
and leftover space construction materials

83
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,845
have collided to form millions
of scrap metal parts

84
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,139
<i>precariously floating in space.</i>

85
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,643
<i>Workers risk their lives
to chase down space debris</i>

86
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,479
<i>flying ten times faster
than a speeding bullet</i>

87
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,356
<i>just to be able to afford their next meal.</i>

88
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,273
<i>Look.</i>

89
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:49,403
<i>I will be the first to admit
that our Eden is not perfect. Yet.</i>

90
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,823
<i>But I would happily have a deeper
conversation with you about this.</i>

91
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,705
<i>Space debris, 1.7 tons.
Just crashed with a satellite.</i>

92
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,499
<i>Probably came from the Lagrangian Point.</i>

93
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,835
Speed's at 7km/sec, still slow.

94
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,325
Watch out for the jellyfish.

95
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,590
<i>It won't matter what we haul
if we nick UTS property.</i>

96
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:13,719
<i>It's going from District D 79.348 to 30.</i>

97
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,141
<i>You who hooked the satellite, stay away.</i>

98
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,978
<i>That'll cost you at least $800.</i>

99
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,859
<i>Easy. Gently.</i>

100
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,279
They are not here. Right?

101
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,364
- Who?
- Who do you think?

102
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,783
<i>I heard he went down to Earth yesterday.</i>

103
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,660
They can't be back yet.

104
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,497
Huh?

105
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,499
Sh…

106
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,167
- Fuck.
<i>- I can't believe this!</i>

107
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,891
<i>You said they wouldn't be here!</i>

108
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,136
VICTORY

109
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,770
Out of my way, you fuckin' amateurs.

110
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,274
Let's grab what's ours.

111
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,360
Step on it.

112
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,160
<i>Victory.</i>
<i>Upper deck gravity level 0.8 G's.</i>

113
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,746
<i>Magnetic compensation 1.2 Gs.</i>

114
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,832
Ah, move aside.
I'll show you how it's done.

115
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,342
<i>- Stay focused!</i>
<i>- Stop them!</i>

116
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,512
They're dragging it the other way!

117
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,311
Get them!

118
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,980
<i>Grab it!</i>

119
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,904
<i>You Victory sons of bitches!</i>

120
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,847
<i>I'll kill those sons of bitches!</i>

121
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,432
<i>- Assholes!</i>
<i>- Kill them!</i>

122
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,446
My, such dirty mouths.

123
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,909
No imagination at all.
Is all that swearing really necessary?

124
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,547
Hey, Park. They're gaining on us.

125
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,133
You heard the bot.
Speed it up, Park.

126
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,742
I'd like to see one of them
come down here and work this thing.

127
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,661
Time to wrap it up, guys.

128
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,678
<i>They're getting away! Step on it!</i>

129
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,764
<i>You better stop</i>
<i>before I get really fucking pissed.</i>

130
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,684
<i>Just catch them!</i>

131
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,395
<i>You are seriously</i>
<i>going to take everything?</i>

132
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,816
<i>Get lost, Jang! We were here first!</i>

133
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,570
<i>Can't you share?</i>

134
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,533
<i>Think about the other ships!</i>

135
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,535
Damn you!

136
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,413
You're confusing me
with someone who gives a shit.

137
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,625
<i>Solar panels ahead.</i>

138
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,836
<i>Alter course. Alter course.</i>

139
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,797
Uh, guys, can we stay clear of this?

140
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,783
- <i>You're dead if we catch you!</i>
<i>- You'll go to hell for this!</i>

141
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,119
- <i>Human trash!</i>
<i>- We'll get you next time!</i>

142
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,205
<i>This shit ain't ethical, Tae-ho!</i>

143
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,207
Tell me how that's working for you.

144
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,374
Being all ethical, huh?

145
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,423
Ah, you are doing good.
You're out here busting your asses.

146
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,884
Just to make a few lousy bucks, right?

147
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,219
<i>I'll fucking kill you.</i>

148
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,970
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

149
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,972
<i>Hey. What… What's that?</i>

150
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,892
<i>Approaching
UTS Residential District 3.</i>

151
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,175
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
<i>- We're gonna crash!</i>

152
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,628
<i>- Turn the ship around!</i>
<i>- Oh, shit, shit! Stop!</i>

153
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,694
<i>If they had caught us inside UTS,
we're dead!</i>

154
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,258
<i>- Watch out!</i>
<i>- Look out!</i>

155
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,241
<i>- Well, there goes the antenna.</i>
<i><i>- What a pain in the ass.</i>

156
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:12,226
<i>Victory. Let me see. Hmm.</i>

157
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,395
<i>210 kilograms of titanium.</i>

158
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,189
<i>480 kilos of reinforced carbon-carbon.</i>

159
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:21,110
<i>Aluminum honeycomb, 17.
Other materials, 39.</i>

160
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,238
<i>That's a total of $584.</i>

161
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,117
- And that car?
- The garage is full.

162
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,399
However, if you want to take it down
from here to Earth,

163
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,872
you are going to need to pay
an extra 70K for reassembly.

164
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,529
If you don't want to pay, you could
put it back together yourself.

165
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,959
Oh.

166
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,628
I see here you broke
an antenna off the jelly.

167
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,839
You need to pay $1,300 for that.

168
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:45,509
We can deduct it from your money
and collect the rest from your account.

169
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,887
These here are for your taxes. Pay up.

170
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,268
Why show me cash?

171
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,688
If you're not gonna pay me,
why show me the cash at all? You pig!

172
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,815
Give it to me! Hand it over!

173
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,651
Hey. This is company money.

174
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,990
You better sleep with an eye open.
I might pay you a visit.

175
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,868
- Anything come in?
- Just one.

176
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,413
In the Thunderbolt, 12kg of iced pork.

177
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,166
Accident on a refrigerator spaceship.

178
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,172
You've been looking for her
for three years now.

179
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,926
What you gonna do?

180
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,261
Well, for one thing,
I need to keep making money.

181
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,264
I'll do anything to earn cash.

182
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,226
Seriously, anything.

183
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,608
Oh, Tae-ho, there you are!
Heard you just came from Earth, huh?

184
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,068
Eh, still nothing?

185
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,321
Uh, why are you wearing
plastic bags on your feet, huh?

186
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:51,367
Oh, how's Captain Jang? Beautiful as ever?

187
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,786
She asked me to tell you.

188
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,412
For me? What did she say?

189
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,656
If you talk to her again, she'll kill you.

190
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,252
- All right.
- That's good. That's good.

191
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,743
- Let's watch TV.
<i>- Fine dust. Raging viruses.</i>

192
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,578
- Twenty-five, fifty-two.
<i>- Gas masks have…</i>

193
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,677
{\an8}<i>Meanwhile, UTS authorities
continue to search for Dorothy…</i>

194
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,240
{\an8}- She looks so real.
- Have you seen this?

195
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,474
{\an8}<i>…the missing android, which was stolen
two days ago by the extremist Black Foxes.</i>

196
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,637
{\an8}Those Black Foxes give me the creeps.

197
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,728
{\an8}<i>To date, no clues have been found.</i>

198
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,813
I'm out of here.

199
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,776
<i>It may look like an innocent child,</i>

200
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,901
<i>but it is actually a devastating weapon
of mass destruction.</i>

201
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,028
<i>If you encounter Dorothy,
do not go near it.</i>

202
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,406
- Ciao.
<i>- Call 900 immediately.</i>

203
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,784
Ah, come on!

204
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,829
<i>You built Victory
with reinforced duralumin.</i>

205
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:42,251
<i>Installed quantum radar. Top speed 48,000.
With 3.2 million pounds of thrust.</i>

206
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,254
<i>You've got this beast of a ship.
Why can't you make any money?</i>

207
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,922
<i>It's all debt, man.</i>

208
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,216
<i>A lot of it is just
garbage collection shit.</i>

209
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,844
<i>Captain Jang went overboard
on the modifications.</i>

210
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,847
<i>We first got into debt because we had
to repair, and then came the fines.</i>

211
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,932
<i>And debt only leads to more debt.</i>

212
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,616
<i>But you guys have good teamwork.</i>

213
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,770
<i>Teamwork, my ass.
We're all hanging by a thread.</i>

214
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,953
Check!

215
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,171
Damn.

216
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,757
"Seven, three." I'm screwed.

217
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,052
You guys are betting chump change.
Stop overthinking it. Hurry up!

218
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,679
I'll double it.

219
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,806
Whoa, $10! What a jackpot.

220
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,851
I'll see that, and add two more.

221
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,353
I'm out.

222
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,943
Can you shut your mouth for once?

223
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,029
I don't have a mouth. Joke's on you.

224
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,407
What are you all angry at me for?
That's it. I'm done after this round.

225
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,118
It's no fun. Everyone's so on edge.

226
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,454
There's something I need to say
to everyone here now.

227
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,248
Sure, but if it's about me,
I don't wanna hear it.

228
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,210
Feeling lucky today. All in.

229
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,378
Someone's taken the rice.

230
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,006
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

231
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,301
First, it was a toolbox.
Then, it was the battery.

232
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,721
I think some asshole here
has been stealing stuff from the ship

233
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,390
to make extra money on the side.

234
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,271
Captain Jang, can't imagine
that booze is cheap.

235
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,815
I'm sure a bottle costs at least 80.

236
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,859
Shut up. I'm in, come on.
I'll raise you ten.

237
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,114
Change the subject fast, huh? I guess
you like to insult my intelligence.

238
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,188
The old me would've already strung you up
to keep others from getting ideas.

239
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,536
Are you losing your fucking mind or what?

240
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,385
Wanna find out who really gets strung up?

241
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,654
Oh, remember the grace period
for our loan is up.

242
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,709
We have to pay 2,000
in a month going forward.

243
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,462
Didn't we get an extension on that?
What's our remaining balance?

244
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:55,551
By now, it should be about…
Let's see. Maybe, $16, $17,000?

245
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,761
Not to mention the nine grand
we owe the union.

246
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,848
I'm gonna find out who the thief is today,
no matter what you do.

247
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,766
I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

248
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,227
Now, if you'll excuse me,
this is a big hand.

249
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,688
We also received
a notice of seizure from the court.

250
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,811
It's a financial disaster.

251
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,943
Bubs, please! You don't have to tell me
things I don't ask about, okay?

252
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,863
All right, sure. There was one
more thing, but I'll stop there.

253
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,031
What is it?

254
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,533
Our money manager ran away.

255
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,495
- What?
- Remember Piggy's dad, who had the fund?

256
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,570
Anyway, the guy ran off. We found out
about it while you went down to Earth.

257
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,749
Guess we forgot to tell you.

258
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,433
- What are you talking about?
- All right, show your cards!

259
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,589
Looks like I won again.
I'm getting a little bored at this.

260
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,352
Captain Jang,
you knew about this?

261
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,902
I thought…

262
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,760
You said we could trust this guy.

263
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,305
We invested all our money
with him, and he runs away?

264
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,140
- We gotta play again tomorrow.
- Shit!

265
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,766
We lost 100,000! That was all we had!

266
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,050
You think I'll go easy on you
'cause you're the captain?

267
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,582
- Where's my money?
- Where's my rice?

268
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,094
Captain Jang!

269
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,859
Oh, sorry.

270
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,154
Too slow.

271
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,465
One, two, step over you.

272
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,508
{\an8}TOUCH THIS AND I'LL BREAK YOUR WRIST

273
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,264
<i>Fined for satellite damage.
720, has been withdrawn.</i>

274
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,934
<i>Remaining balance, zero.</i>

275
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,230
That's a lot of zeros.
One, two, three.

276
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,732
Jeez, skin is freaking expensive.

277
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,401
Whenever I caught a thief,
I'd cut off both hands.

278
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,363
I kept one and sent the other one
to his boss.

279
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,446
Ah, Park's talking about
the old days again.

280
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,116
Why doesn't he tell it to his therapist?

281
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,244
That's Tiger Park to you,
rust bucket.

282
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,371
Where are those hands now,
if you kept some?

283
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,832
- Don't believe me?
- I believe you. I do.

284
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,543
I just want one for myself. That's all.

285
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,296
Graphene titanium.
Sharpest ax in the world.

286
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,881
One hand for you, one hand for me.

287
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,801
Hey, cut the chatter,
and let's get some work done.

288
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,804
Ugh. I should've taken the day off.

289
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,247
You know, I'm surprised this ship
is in such good condition,

290
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,808
if it came from Lagrangian Point.

291
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,977
Shouldn't the nanobots
have eaten it up by now?

292
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,271
Ugh. What if they spread to us?

293
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,773
What are you afraid of?
They're already everywhere.

294
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,650
But we don't have <i>these </i>nanobots.

295
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,569
Lagrangian nanobots are invincible.
They don't even die.

296
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,893
I'm telling you. If these get aboard,
all of us will die.

297
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,387
Don't you worry about that.

298
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,035
I will starve to death
long before that happens.

299
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:33,500
Do you think poverty makes us bad
or that we're poor because we're bad?

300
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,377
If all of you starved to death,

301
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,046
I'd transfer ownership
of this ship to me, and...

302
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,381
- Huh?
- What's that?

303
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,931
A missing child. Great.

304
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:14,351
We can forget about getting any work done.
Police will drag us around.

305
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,312
They'll nitpick everything
and find an excuse for more fines.

306
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,024
<i>Projected profit loss, $7,300.</i>

307
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,819
- This is so annoying.
- What a headache.

308
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,321
If we find her parents,
think they'd pay us?

309
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,596
Hey. Are you a UTS citizen?

310
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,440
She doesn't have a translator
device. Uh, are you a UTS citizen?

311
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,955
- Huh? What's UTS?
- Oh, are you Korean?

312
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,332
Does your family have a big house?
Lots of stuff?

313
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,542
I don't have a home.

314
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,922
Can you give me some food, please?
I'm getting hungry.

315
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,008
Hey, kid. Shut it.
You've got some nerve, huh?

316
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,094
Ugh, not even a thank you.

317
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,473
You found her in the cabin?

318
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,017
Yes, between the air bags
in the cargo bay.

319
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,853
I'm surprised that she survived.

320
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,566
But that funny little bowl cut
looks familiar for some reason.

321
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,154
Su-ni!
Now, where did my Su-ni go?

322
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,197
Oh, there she is!

323
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,199
Ah, I found my little girl.

324
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,753
We'll take her
to the security center

325
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,328
as soon as we fix the ship.

326
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:32,137
{\an8}<i>Meanwhile, UTS authorities
continue to search for Dorothy.</i>

327
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,306
- You sure we haven't met?
- I'm sure.

328
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,018
<i>The android was last seen
two days ago with the Black Foxes,</i>

329
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:42,564
<i>who allegedly planted a compact
hydrogen bomb in its hardware.</i>

330
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,442
{\an8}<i>This is what the weaponized robot
looks like.</i>

331
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,653
{\an8}<i>The innocent face masks a deadly weapon.</i>

332
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,239
<i>The robot is highly lethal.
Extremely dangerous.</i>

333
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,200
<i>It poses a great danger</i>

334
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,703
<i>and could be used
to terrorize the entire UTS.</i>

335
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,164
Get down!

336
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,052
Huh?

337
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,429
- Huh?
- Huh?

338
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,389
Huh?

339
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,186
Move! Move!

340
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,317
No! No! Stay back! No, no!

341
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,581
What's up with that kid?

342
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,208
That kid is a fucking bomb.

343
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,544
No wonder.
That's why we couldn't get a reading.

344
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,588
Her skin grafts looks so real. Wow!

345
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,272
<i>Hey, look out. She's on the move.</i>

346
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,138
<i>The bomb won't go off
if she gets upset?</i>

347
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,695
<i>Shut up and call up the cops.</i>

348
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,720
Nine, zero, zero.

349
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,973
<i>Thank you for calling
the UTS Crime Hotline.</i>

350
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,934
<i>If you are a citizen, press one.
Non-citizens, press two.</i>

351
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:01,935
Non-citizen.

352
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,563
<i>Why don't you tie her up
outside the ship, Bubs?</i>

353
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,107
<i>Me? Why do you always ask me
to do the dangerous stuff?</i>

354
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,734
<i>Press 14 for miscellaneous crimes.
Is this miscellaneous?</i>

355
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,138
<i>Well, one of us has to do it.
Rock, paper, scissors?</i>

356
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,446
Rock, paper, scissors.

357
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,461
Whoa! Whoa! Oh…

358
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,255
Stay back. No, no, don't come near me!

359
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,620
- I spilled, and I wanted to wipe it up.
- Shut your mouth.

360
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,218
<i>- How did he screw that up?</i>
<i>- What a moron.</i>

361
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,469
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

362
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:40,140
Don't… don't even look at me.
And don't take any deep breaths.

363
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,142
You better not get attached, okay?

364
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,435
I'm not a good person.

365
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,228
Huh?

366
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,280
That's one convincing robot.

367
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,283
That thing gives me the creeps.

368
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,744
What's all that?

369
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,204
{\an8}WRITING KOREAN

370
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,292
"Kang Hyeo-nu"? Who's that?

371
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,845
"UTS," huh?

372
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,309
"Kang Hyeo-nu."

373
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:28,021
{\an8}Tons of missed calls.
Last one made just now.

374
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,031
I gotta talk about this, guys.

375
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,914
- Don't blow up! Don't blow up!
- Ay, ay, ay!

376
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,467
You called the cops?

377
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,290
Yeah, but the bastards
had me on hold all day.

378
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,179
- Will they come?
- No way.

379
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,348
Time to listen up, you guys.

380
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,518
Two Black Fox were shot by the Space
Guards while running away with the kid.

381
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,441
One of them is dead,
but the other one escaped.

382
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,176
The kid entered Lagrangian Point
on her own,

383
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:57,360
so both the Space Guard and the Black Fox
are looking for her everywhere. Hm?

384
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,113
Uh, does this story have a point?
'Cause I'm getting bored.

385
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,824
I'm telling you.

386
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,212
We can use her to make
some real money here.

387
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,078
Money?

388
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,802
Would the cops give us non-citizen money?

389
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,165
Not on your life.

390
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,626
You're saying it'd be better for us to try
selling that bomb to the Black Foxes?

391
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,421
In other words, you want us
to extort money from those terrorists?

392
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,047
We'd bag a million bucks.

393
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,466
A million?

394
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,885
I don't know.
Sounds like a shitty thing to do.

395
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,720
What do you care?

396
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,055
Fine by me.

397
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,266
I'll just make the money myself.

398
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,392
Not so fast.

399
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,090
What gives you the right to take the bomb?

400
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,979
You walk out now,
and I'll have the Space Guard

401
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,222
all over you in five minutes.

402
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,690
Listen.

403
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,943
Jang, it's 40 to you.
Then 30 to Park and me. Okay?

404
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,030
"Okay"?

405
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,492
- Forgetting someone?
- All right, then.

406
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,746
Thirty-five to you, 35 to me, 20, ten.
What do you think?

407
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,915
- "Ten"?
- Why am I second to last, huh?

408
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,625
What the hell happened to my 40 percent?

409
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,627
You saying I don't matter
or something?

410
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,086
I want my five back.

411
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,297
I'm worth way more than ten.

412
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,884
Forty, 30, 20, and I'll take ten.
Are you happy?

413
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,348
- Greedy people go to hell, remember?
- Fine by me.

414
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,392
You sure you can really handle a job
like this? I've got doubts about you.

415
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,938
Hey, Park.
You forgot about what I used to do, huh?

416
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,652
I've dealt with assholes
like them all the time.

417
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,210
You just gotta tell them what you want.
Not getting intimidated.

418
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,808
Aren't you going to order?

419
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,364
If not, then get out.

420
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,366
I'll have a coke.

421
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,744
Where is she?

422
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,996
Where's the freaking kid?

423
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,333
What… What is that?
Is that… Is that a giraffe?

424
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,752
This kid is drawing all over my room
without asking me.

425
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,962
Hey!

426
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,922
Damn, the microphone's broken.
What do we do?

427
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,578
Use your headset and jack up the pitch.

428
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,247
- What's this?
- It's a smartphone.

429
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,095
Uses a private satellite. Hard to trace.
Very popular with criminals.

430
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,098
They caught one
of the Black Foxes, right?

431
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,349
If he had one,
won't the police know where to find us?

432
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,269
I don't really know
a ton about the technical side.

433
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,020
Do you know a ton about the Black Foxes?

434
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,606
Not too much.
They weren't really around in my day.

435
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,567
You don't know anything, huh?

436
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,778
There we go. Huh? Should I call?

437
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,947
- Hmm.
- All right, then.

438
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,961
Hello?

439
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,468
Do you own this object, Dr. Kang?

440
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,097
<i>How much do you want?</i>

441
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,310
How much? How much… Fuck!

442
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,477
- How much?
- Let me think.

443
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,561
A million? Two million?

444
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,244
- What do you think?
- A million. Or wait!

445
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,524
- Two million.
- Wait. Hold on.

446
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,276
- No…
- Two million is too high.

447
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,570
- 1.5.
- One and a half million.

448
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:52,702
If you really insist,
we'll give you a discount.

449
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,954
<i>Two million. In cash.</i>

450
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,333
<i>Let's meet immediately.</i>

451
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,793
- <i>I'll pay you once I see it.</i>
- Come on…

452
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,715
<i>By exit two</i>
<i>of the Jenice Telescope Station.</i>

453
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,593
<i>Zone G, at 13:00!</i>

454
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,181
- Not there. No!
- Come on…

455
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,436
At 32nd Commercial District, Club Ghost,

456
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,315
in front of gate two at 14:00.

457
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,320
Just a minute!

458
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,843
What should I tell him?

459
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,532
I'm worried about an explosion.

460
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,702
Should I take precautions?

461
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,290
<i>It won't explode
without an order.</i>

462
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,043
<i>If this is a prank call, you will die.</i>

463
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,129
<i>Don't be late. We won't wait.</i>

464
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,720
I'm rich! Yihee!

465
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,098
- I'm rich…
- Yeah!

466
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,266
- Yes, a drink. Drink it up!
- Woo-hoo!

467
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,227
You deserve it after that, huh!

468
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,105
- I knew you'd pull it off.
- Yes, that's right!

469
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:13,825
<i>At 32nd Commercial District, Club Ghost,</i>

470
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:17,662
<i>in front of gate two at 14:00.</i>

471
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,581
Bring me Dorothy.

472
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,877
The fate of the human race is in danger.

473
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,508
Be quiet and stay still.

474
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,344
- Hey, are you listening to me?
- But I'm already still.

475
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,852
Is that a giraffe? You could use
some drawing lessons, you know.

476
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,478
It's a dinosaur, dummy.

477
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,364
Hey, I'll show you a dinosaur.

478
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,670
Take a good look at that, right there.
What do you think about this?

479
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,078
That's how a dinosaur
is supposed to look, huh?

480
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,665
This one's a dinosaur, too.

481
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,418
Look up there. It's the same one.

482
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,008
- That's...
- Look at these other ones I drew.

483
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,766
Well, would you look at that.
I think I know who this is supposed to be.

484
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,478
But don't you think my eyes
are much bigger?

485
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,189
Okay, I'll make the eyes a little bigger.

486
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,523
Yes, that's right.

487
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,610
Good. Show me. The nose, too. Look.

488
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,362
- The nose?
- Yes, bigger. A lot bigger.

489
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,275
You're just doing this
to torture us, aren't you?

490
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:44,373
Do me a favor. If you're about
to explode, let us know, please.

491
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,417
I want a chance to get out of here, okay?

492
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,261
All right, time for you
to put this thing on.

493
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,172
Does that mean
we're going home soon, Uncle Tiger?

494
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,219
Go time.
Are we ready? We have five minutes!

495
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,375
I've gotta warm up the engine
or it might die.

496
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,128
Well, I'm gonna die
if we're late! Come here. Bubs, you, too.

497
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,518
Two million! Think about two million, huh?

498
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,270
Okay, let's huddle up.
One, two, three! We got this.

499
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,114
<i>Opening docking port.</i>

500
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,818
Ah, we don't have time for this.
Who is it? Didn't you lock the door?

501
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:18,199
"P-O-L-I-C…"

502
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,119
- Everyone act normal.
- "Police"?

503
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,202
Let's move!

504
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,705
Wait, wait, wait.

505
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,707
- Stop it!
- Hide her over here.

506
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,292
Hurry up!

507
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,336
I'm forcing the door!

508
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,847
Why didn't you open up?

509
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,599
No respect for the UTS Police?

510
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,185
This door, you know.
It's a little funny sometimes.

511
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,854
What's wrong with it this time?

512
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:53,192
You really went wild
on the illegal modifications to your ship.

513
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,778
Our captain
likes to fly it as fast as possible.

514
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,364
Such an ugly ship
is an insult to UTS citizens.

515
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,207
We'll be careful
from now on, officer.

516
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,160
What the hell?

517
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,495
Isn't this military equipment?

518
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,707
Where did you get it?

519
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,877
Oh, that old thing. We picked him up
for cheap at the recycling depot.

520
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,713
He's a good kid. Stay down.

521
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,971
Why grow plants on a spaceship?

522
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,389
Um, excuse me, sir.

523
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,850
We're in a bit of a rush.
What can we do for you?

524
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,493
That's what I want to know.

525
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,271
You're the one who called the police.

526
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,023
Number 14. Miscellaneous crimes.

527
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,815
Sir, let me explain. We just
called to ask a question, you know.

528
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,145
Two minutes left! Just two minutes!
This is crazy.

529
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,023
Who were you looking at?

530
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,818
Huh?

531
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,655
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
That's my money.

532
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,114
You can't take that!

533
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,743
What are you doing?

534
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,703
We never agreed to use my money.

535
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,748
- Stop it! Stop it!
- You son of a bitch!

536
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,391
Wait, wait, wait. Sir, hold on.
We have a very important meeting.

537
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,462
Here, take this. Sir, please.
Wait. Let me just explain...

538
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,466
We got you on video.

539
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,095
I'm surprised you showed up, officer.

540
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,181
You cops never seem to respond
to calls made by non-citizens.

541
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,808
- Hey, Bubs.
- Yeah?

542
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,143
- Did you record him accepting the money?
- Huh?

543
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,564
Oh, yeah. Of course!
I'm always recording! Nothing escapes me.

544
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,776
The lights are off on your ship,
so I bet your shift is over.

545
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,779
Collecting bribes after hours?
We could report that, couldn't we?

546
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,948
Crazy bitch! I didn't ask for bribes.

547
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,242
You didn't tell us
which department you're from.

548
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,120
- Hey, isn't that an illegal firearm?
- Ah, that prick.

549
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,665
Thought you got deported to Earth
if they catch you with an illegal firearm.

550
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,168
Well, I think that's right. You're pretty
brave to carry it in the open like that.

551
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,242
If you were smart,
you'd keep it disassembled.

552
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,632
Just another asshole on a power trip
letting himself get carried away.

553
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,260
Think you're better than a few
fine non-citizens like us?

554
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,183
What gives you the right
to hit me on the head?

555
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,931
Matter of fact, what gives you
the right to do anything?

556
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,775
- Listen to me.
- Okay, I'm all metal.

557
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,007
If you were really serious
about getting away with this,

558
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,438
you'd have to kill all of us
and destroy the evidence.

559
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,064
Think you can handle that?

560
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,945
But there's always the option
of getting the hell out of here.

561
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:46,866
- You're going to pay for this!
- Okay now! Fuck off!

562
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,367
Captain!

563
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:52,038
He's gone! Okay, he's gone.
Hey, Park, get ready! The bag.

564
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,748
Okay. The bag's ready! Let's go.

565
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,215
Hey, Park, hurry. Come on!

566
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,013
Told you
this would be better for the swap.

567
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,223
Goddamn! Sometimes I even impress myself.

568
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,059
- Good job to me, huh?
- Hey, Tae-ho.

569
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,187
I was wondering something.
What… What's gonna happen to our kid?

570
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,398
- "Our kid?"
- Well, yeah.

571
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,484
She's not ours,
and she's not even a kid.

572
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,600
Who gives a shit if they blow her up
or throw her in the garbage or whatever?

573
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,492
- I mean, still…
- TAE-HO: Listen to me.

574
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,741
We're here to make money, remember?

575
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,826
Pull yourself together, okay?

576
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:43,214
Oh, shit. It must be getting stuffy
in there. Hang on a bit longer, okay?

577
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,491
Hey, asshole. I told you, gate two!

578
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,244
Do you want your pet or not?

579
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,080
Are you new at this?

580
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,832
No bullets?

581
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,043
And you came alone.

582
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:25,881
Do you trust me, or underestimate me?

583
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,758
Follow me, asshole!

584
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,304
I got eyes on Dr. Kang.
No ID on the other male.

585
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,099
<i>Take them all out</i>
<i>as soon as you see Dorothy.</i>

586
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,186
<i>Okay, guys, get ready!</i>

587
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,151
Just speak in Korean, Kang Hyeo-nu.

588
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,070
Don't try any tricks.

589
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,826
- First, give me the girl.
- Money first.

590
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,203
Money first!

591
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,381
<i>Make sure to retrieve Dorothy's body.</i>

592
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,091
<i>Prepare to engage.</i>

593
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,844
Is this the correct amount?

594
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,387
<i>You see what I see?</i>

595
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,431
Nice.

596
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,648
What the hell is this?
She's not in here.

597
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,444
You bastards.
Who the hell are you anyway, huh?

598
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,279
Huh?

599
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,447
Where did she go?

600
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,660
Dorothy's gone.
I lost it. I lost it.

601
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:52,176
<i>You need to find her right now!
If anyone recognizes her, we're done!</i>

602
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,487
Kot-nim!

603
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,711
Kot-nim!

604
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,295
- Goddamn.
- Who is this kid?

605
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,885
<i>It is nearly
indistinguishable from a real human child,</i>

606
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,514
<i>but is actually a dangerous weapon
that could cause mass destruction.</i>

607
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,225
<i>It is equipped with a micro-explosive…</i>

608
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:44,478
Stay calm, everyone!
It won't go off. Trust me, it won't! No…

609
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,063
Eyes on the DJ booth.

610
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,692
- What's happening?
- What the…

611
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,819
<i>Target locked. All units engage.</i>

612
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,364
Out of the way! Kot-nim, go!

613
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,032
Kot-nim!

614
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,617
Kot-nim!

615
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,245
Kot-nim!

616
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,998
Where has Hyeo-nu gone? Oh, my God!

617
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,166
Kang Hyeo-nu! Come back here! Now!

618
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,845
Holy shit.

619
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,224
<i>Fire, number one. Take it down.</i>

620
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,484
<i>Camilla, no organic matter detected.</i>

621
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,988
<i>They're gone.</i>

622
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,662
How did you let that kid
out of your sight?

623
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,583
Hey, Park, why do you always
have to do things so half-assed, huh?

624
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,466
Why did you return the money?
We could have just taken it and got away!

625
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,922
You think you're smart? It was your idea
to make the swap in a packed club.

626
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,006
Shit!

627
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,135
I knew this wouldn't work out.

628
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,292
You always say that
after something doesn't work out!

629
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,944
It would have if I'd come with you.

630
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,492
- Then why the hell didn't you?
- Can't handle the truth?

631
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,118
Both of you shut up for a second.
The smartphone? We can track...

632
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,940
This thing almost got us caught.

633
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,984
The Space Guards
were listening to everything.

634
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,642
I kept the number and the line code,
so we can use our own signal.

635
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,948
Radio messages can't travel too far,
but we'll keep trying.

636
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,575
First, let's get the fuck out of here.

637
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,453
The engine's dead.
It means we're stuck here.

638
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,830
Oh, what are we gonna do? This is so...

639
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,209
God, it's just…
Two million bucks. We're so screwed!

640
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,337
Uncle Tae-ho, did you lose a lot of money?

641
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,014
Hey, I'm not done with this one yet.

642
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,018
What was your name again?

643
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,689
Kot-nim is my name.

644
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,261
- "Kot-nim"?
- Aren't you Dorothy?

645
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,192
But my real name is just Kot-nim.

646
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,695
Kot-nim. That's pretty.

647
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,905
Kot-nim?
Doesn't roll off the tongue.

648
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,240
It's better than Bubs.

649
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,323
Don't say her name.

650
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:10,916
- Kot-nim, what's wrong?
- I think Uncle Tae-ho is scared of me.

651
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:11,999
Hmm?

652
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,214
No, that's not true. Come here.

653
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,466
Oh, my God.

654
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,470
Do we think Kot-nim
is something to be afraid of?

655
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,220
Hey, put down the fucking bomb, man.

656
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,472
I think Uncle Tiger
is the scariest person here.

657
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,267
Better watch out!

658
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,436
- Let's go scare Tae-ho! Scaredy-cat!
- Hey, come on!

659
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,300
- What's the matter?
- Enough! Seriously

660
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,992
- There he goes. Let's go get him.
- I'm not joking.

661
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,817
- Stay away from me!
- Run, run, run!

662
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,141
- Let's go get him! Come on!
- Don't come near me!

663
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,553
He's so scared. Look at him.

664
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:55,586
<i>Another miracle brought to you
by UTS's latest nanobot technology.</i>

665
00:45:55,669 --> 00:46:01,383
<i>The tree of life, the Super Plant,
takes its roots in a whole new planet.</i>

666
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,595
<i>Welcome to the second space revolution.</i>

667
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:08,307
<i>Mars. A happiness you never knew.</i>

668
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,186
Krypton waves have
the ability to defuse nanobots

669
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,856
and are only emitted during
the detonation of a hydrogen bomb.

670
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,734
But all of that is irrelevant
to our presentation.

671
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,486
Exactly. Totally irrelevant.

672
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,821
The Black Foxes have a hydrogen bomb.

673
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,073
Many UTS citizens are worried about that.

674
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,785
The reach of Krypton waves is 5,000km.

675
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,953
There's no danger of exposure to Mars.

676
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,373
I would like to add a few words
to the voiceover.

677
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,710
The video is not a matter
of urgency at the moment.

678
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,047
Before Tree of Life,
I would like you to say this is a species

679
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,716
genetically modified
to survive in Mars soil,

680
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,719
that it can only grow on that planet.

681
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,804
I just thought that...

682
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,766
We have to make it stunningly clear…

683
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:56,271
…that there is no hope left on Earth.

684
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,689
I'm very sorry, Mr. Sullivan.

685
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,773
Prove it.

686
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,567
I need empirical evidence.

687
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:06,740
Physically prove your crushing regret.

688
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,787
Right here and now.

Pierre, we appreciate the help, really,

692
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,082
but if you could maybe not sing
on the emergency channel

693
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,512
while the other ships can hear you.

694
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,086
<i>- Shut up, Pierre!</i>
<i>- There goes that idiot again!</i>

697
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:41,191
Captain Jang, I wrote a song for you.
I would love for you to hear it.

698
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,275
Please.

704

705
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,012
You hear that?
Captain Jang kissed Pierre.

706
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,889
Please, they did
way more than that.

707
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,391
Who cares?
Bubs, give me your cash.

708
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,851
Not again!

709
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,646
- Is this strawberry flavor?
- Yes, sir.

710
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,273
Thank you.

711
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:24,026
Why is my money always the emergency fund?

712
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,789
I bought that battery last time, remember?

713
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,529
We also need a welding rod.

714
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,950
- They closed my tab long ago.
- Whatever. I just think it's ridiculous.

715
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,536
Three grown adults,
and not a dollar between you.

716
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,123
After this, we'll be dirt broke.
What did I even save for?

717
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,463
I'm sorry to bother you, Tae-ho.

718
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,215
- Can you do me a favor?
- Can't.

719
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,551
But I haven't said what it is yet.

720
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,075
Whatever it is, you can tell me,
but it won't change anything.

721
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,348
Can I borrow your scissors, please?

722
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,599
No.

723
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:03,315
- You can do me a favor.
- Good idea! Whatever it is, let's go!

724
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,110
High five!

725
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,580
Don't do anything.
I want no giggling, chatting, or drawing.

726
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,290
None of that.

727
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,384
Scissors, huh?

728
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,620
- Careful now.
- Yeah, I'll be careful.

729
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,436
I meant with the tomatoes.

730
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,859
Hey, I told you to wait on the ship!

731
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,781
As soon as I found these, Pierre,
I thought of you and came straight here.

732
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,449
Thanks again for everything.

733
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,286
- Damn, is that a real tomato?
- I've never tasted one myself.

734
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,251
Damn, that's good!

735
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,591
- One dollar for each of them.
- One dollar!

736
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,759
Enjoy!

737
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,220
Thank you!

738
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,640
- Thank you very much!
- Two red tomatoes.

739
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,976
- Two? That's two dollars.
- Two tomatoes for you.

740
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,676
- Hey, I said red!
- Your turn.

741
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,896
Yay, we're gonna be a huge success!

742
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:26,982
Hey, one at a time.

743
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,067
No cutting in line.

744
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:31,987
Thanks! Bye!

745
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,323
It tastes so bad.

746
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,451
Twenty-two, 23… Okay!

747
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,838
Got it all over your face.

748
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,675
Much better.

749
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,302
What are you laughing at?

750
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,014
There.

751
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,682
I got us a welding rod!

752
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:07,689
<i>Now, Tiger Park,
there's a story. Hold still.</i>

753
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,150
Once, he was a leader of a drug cartel.

754
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,736
Used the money he made selling drugs
to help poor kids.

755
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,490
He had more money than he could count.
He had to weigh the cash with a scale.

756
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,825
At one point,
he even had a tiger as a pet!

757
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,328
As for Captain Jang,
she's smart but has such a temper.

758
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,581
So be careful not to get on, okay?

759
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,334
And you know, she has the most foul mouth…

760
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,545
Hey, I'm telling you important stuff!

761
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,215
Why is the ship called Victory?

762
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,884
Captain Jang was looking for ideas,
and I came up with it.

763
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,345
I used to think that winning
was always a good thing.

764
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,389
What about you, lady?
What did you used to do?

765
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,557
"Lady"?

766
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,227
Huh…

767
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:51,233
My goodness! I mean, that's…
You just made my day.

768
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,570
I'm planning to get
skin grafting done, actually.

769
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:59,199
If I alter my bone structures, too,
it'll cost about 20,000.

770
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,661
This is all illegal, of course.
It's just I can't go through with it

771
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,538
because I'm afraid
people will laugh at me.

772
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:08,583
But that's just an excuse.
I can't afford it, even if I wanted to.

773
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,337
You wanna know what I used to do?

774
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,466
Air-to-air combat,
infiltrating behind enemy lines,

775
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,051
assassinations and…

776
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,013
Wait.

777
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,057
You're not actually a...

778
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,225
Not what?

779
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,894
Oh, now I'm really jealous.

780
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:32,023
Why didn't you just come out and tell me?
Aren't we girl friends? You can trust me.

781
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,235
Do you think Uncle Tae-ho
has always been this scary?

782
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:39,322
He's not scary, dear.
He's just poor, desperate, and mean.

783
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,406
Kim Tae-ho…

784
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,035
Sometimes, I feel bad for him.

785
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,787
Illegal aliens on board.

786
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,414
Permission to engage.

787
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,435
<i>Tae-ho was a child soldier.</i>

788
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,646
<i>In his short life, he had
already seen terrible things.</i>

789
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,274
<i>One day, he saw something
he never had before.</i>

790
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:18,236
<i>A human baby.
He told us it looked like an angel to him.</i>

791
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,032
<i>Illegal Status. Case number 349547.</i>

792
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,867
<i>Female, seven months.</i>

793
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,329
<i>According to the rules, he should
have sent her back to Earth immediately.</i>

794
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,998
<i>But he had power back then,
and chose not to.</i>

795
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,627
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie!
Hold on a sec. Let me just…

796
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,320
<i>Make sure she naps at two.</i>

797
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,423
If she won't drink her formula,
give her warm water.

798
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,386
<i>As time went on,
he grew attached to her.</i>

799
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,636
<i>So just like that, he became a dad.</i>

800
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,679
<i>He was only 20 years old.</i>

801
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,848
Make sure not to go too far. You hear me?

802
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:51,478
Su-ni! Su-ni? Su-ni!

803
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,647
<i>Surgery could bring
her hearing back,</i>

804
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,567
but she will have to work on her
pronunciation for the rest of her life.

805
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,864
It appears that an extremely loud noise
damaged her auditory nerves.

806
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,157
It's all my fault.

807
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,535
I would do anything for you.

808
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:12,540
I swear that I'll be
the best dad in the world, all right?

809
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,753
No matter what happens,
I'll always be there for you.

810
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:27,639
<i>After that,
Tae-ho couldn't hurt anyone.</i>

811
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,563
{\an8}SU-NI, I LOVE YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

812
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,399
{\an8}I THINK OF YOU WHEN I'M EATING

813
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,860
Su-ni,
Daddy wrote a song for you.

814
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,864
I could sing it for you now, if you want.
Would you like that? Okay, here I go.

815
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,951
<i>♪ Su-ni ♪</i>

816
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,412
<i>♪ I love you ♪</i>

817
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:55,000
<i>♪ Su-ni, you're my everything ♪</i>

818
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,377

819
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,879
<i>♪ When I tie my shoes ♪</i>

820
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,215

00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,426
<i>♪ My sweet girl ♪</i>

822
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,893
You can't dismiss me without a trial.
What have I done? Let go!

823
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,688
You won't get away with this! You hear me?

824
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,523
<i>He got kicked out
of the Space Guards</i>

825
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,108
<i>because he wouldn't kill for them.</i>

826
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,568
<i>He lost everything he had.</i>

827
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:25,322
<i>He fell from the top of the food chain
and hit rock bottom overnight.</i>

828
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,785
Daddy, look!

829
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,122
It's just a piece of junk.

830
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:42,297
Actually, it looks like a shooting star.
If you make a wish, it will come true.

831
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,806
<i>After wandering around
for a year without a home,</i>

832
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,516
<i>Tae-ho lost himself.</i>

833
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,900
Sorry to rob you so blindly.

834
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,318
You mad?

835
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,527
It's getting hot in here!

836
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,351
No, no, no! You have to pay!

837
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,704
Su-ni, we're gonna have a feast tonight!
Let's get out of here, okay?

838
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,042
- Su-ni, did you hear me?
<i>- Impact alert.</i>

839
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,336
- Su-ni!
<i>- Space debris collision.</i>

840
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,921
Su-ni!

841
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,173
<i>MR-13, block 27.</i>

842
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,843
<i>Sealing off all connected passages.</i>

843
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:36,286
<i>Hmm, that trajectory
doesn't look so great.</i>

844
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,985
I'm going to ask nine crafts
to be assigned to your search mission,

845
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,708
and we will scan the orbit
using her DNA info.

846
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,877
This is provided for free.

847
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,463
The blinker slows down
as the body grows further.

848
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,666
Considering her weight,
the location of disappearance,

849
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,155
and the direction of the trajectory,

850
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:53,720
I project about three years
for her to completely vacate the orbit.

851
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,013
"Vacate the orbit"?

852
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,099
After three years, she'll be gone forever.
Zero chance of recovery.

853
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,768
Don't worry. We have a 100 percent
recovery rate for searches

854
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,520
if found within the first four days.

855
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:06,774
The cost will be 194,000…

856
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,819
Our services are cash only

857
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,530
for non-citizens, inmates,
and customers with criminal records.

858
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:16,201
And, as you know,
non-citizens are always cash only.

859
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,724
If you get the process started, I...

860
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,775
- Next. Number 298.
- I could pay later!

861
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,706
- Please!
- You are done!

862
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,875
A-76301.

863
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:31,549
<i>Even now,
he is still looking for Su-ni.</i>

864
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,803
<i>She's probably still out there
waiting for her dad.</i>

865
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,681
<i>Somewhere in the dark universe.</i>

866
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,184
Hey, Park.

867
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,353
Are you using the torque wrench right now?

868
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,315
Where is that guy? Park!

869
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,984
Who told you you could use my po…

870
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,737
Hmm, it's still missing something.

871
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,113
Hello there, sir.

872
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,157
- Who is this?
- A friend of mine.

873
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:59,577
- We're busy right now. Get lost.
- Can we do something else?

874
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,246
Fine. Just one more touch.

875
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,873
What now?

876
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,625
Are there any adults?

877
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,835
"Adults"? Do I look like some baby to you?

878
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:11,339
Oh, I meant human adults.

879
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,093
It's ringing! Listen!

880
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,345
Listen, it's ringing!

881
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,104
Tae-ho! Hurry! Hurry! Come quick!

882
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,188
Should I answer it?

883
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,899
Come on! Hurry!

884
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:33,528
Stop! We're from the Sector D
Superior Court. We have orders to...

885
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,618
Hello?

886
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,121
<i>F Building, ground floor.</i>

887
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:45,707
- Who is that?
<i>- Meet me there in 30 minutes.</i>

888
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,209
Hey! No, no, no…

889
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:53,631
Block 27, MR-13, in…

890
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,051
two hours, okay?

891
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,178
<i>I'm waiting till you show up.</i>

892
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,348
- All good?
- Yes!

893
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,101
We're back on!

894
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,313
From now on, this property
will belong to the bank.

895
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,231
I'm very sorry for this situation.

896
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:17,822
Go check the engine first.
We have to leave in 30 minutes.

897
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,743
Where did Captain Jang go?
I haven't seen her in a while.

898
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,579
- Hope she's not drinking again.
- I don't wanna send Kot-nim back.

899
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:31,002
Who knows what those Black Fox bastards
are planning to do with her?

900
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,463
Do you know why I'm still alive?

901
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,673
Cause Su-ni's still out there.

902
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,468
But very soon, she'll leave the orbit.

903
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,179
If that happens,
I'll never be able to find her.

904
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:44,349
I need that money right now.

905
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,061
We could all use that money.

906
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,271
Now.

907
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,997
<i>I feel bad, too, you know.</i>

908
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,875
But think of all debt we have.

909
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:56,713
We could pay it all back.
And Bubs, I mean, he…

910
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:05,930
- Kot-nim!
- She's not there?

911
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,628
- Kot-nim!
- No, not inside.

912
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,933
- Kot-nim!
- Kot-nim!

913
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,643
- Kot-nim!
- Kot-nim!

914
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,437
- Kot…
- JANG: Kot-nim!

915
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,606
- Where did she go? Kot-nim!
- Kot-nim!

916
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,567
Kot-nim!

917
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,957
Kot-nim!

918
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,751
Uncle Tiger!

919
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,378
- Uncle Tiger!
- Kot-nim!

920
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,796
<i>Park, where are you?</i>

921
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:40,506
Corridor 17!

922
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,641
Kot-nim!

923
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,057
Why does it feel like I'm the only one
who does any work around here?

924
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,288
Who are you?

925
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,300
Get behind me. Go.

926
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,094
Close your eyes.

927
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,058
You punks wanna dance?

928
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,954
No!

929
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,014
I won't let you take Dorothy.

930
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,561
You can open your eyes now.

931
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,815
Look.

932
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,942
- Huh?
- Karum!

933
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,862
Thank you for coming back.

934
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,114
I know you're a busy man.

935
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:31,576
But I'm the kind of person that cares
about not being misunderstood.

936
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,830
There's also something
I wanted to show you.

937
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,999
UTS is draining Earth's economy.

938
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:42,128
Did you know you can tell a person's
moral disposition by his or her DNA?

939
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,840
The first thing we see is character.

940
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:52,597
At UTS, we select only the most
upstanding citizens to bring to space.

941
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,640
Special Force Squad are the exception.

942
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,059
But these people are wealthy
is coincidence.

943
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,437
I don't care about money.

944
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,525
When you are as old as I am,
money is hardly of consequence.

945
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:11,324
UTS continues to suck out money
and valuable human resources from Earth

946
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:14,827
while dumping radioactive
space debris back on the planet.

947
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:20,416
You, James Sullivan,
you are accelerating its death!

948
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:23,127
I see
you have a wife and a son.

949
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:25,546
A family man.

950
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,174
I lost my family.

951
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,801
A war broke out the year I was born.

952
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:34,096
My father died in battle,
and my mother had to beg on streets

953
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,140
to provide for me and my four siblings.

954
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,188
Genocide swept through our village.

955
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:46,025
Every day, I saw dead bodies falling.

956
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,904
When I was six years old,
my family were killed.

957
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,239
Burned alive before my eyes.

958
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:58,788
I saw my mother screaming
as her chin melted away.

959
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:08,339
And in that moment,
I made a promise to myself.

960
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:14,637
I vowed that I would make
the world a better place.

961
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,602
- I have to poop.
- Oh!

962
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,780
Sorry again for beating you up.
What the hell's going on here?

963
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,657
I should be asking you that question.

964
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,398
- What are you planning to do with Dorothy?
- Let's just call it even.

965
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,787
Go away!
Before Dorothy exits that door.

966
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,497
Why don't we pretend this didn't happen?

967
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,583
- Don't you give us orders!
- It's a suggestion, not an order.

968
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,336
Bubs, cut off the guy's tongue
if he keeps interrupting.

969
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,298
See? Now that is an order.

970
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,468
Looks like we're all trying
to hide something here.

971
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,263
Why don't we talk this out, hmm?

972
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:01,976
I'll get us started.

973
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,271
Robots don't poop, as far as I know.

974
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,482
Kot-nim is a human.

975
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:12,903
I knew it.

976
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,910
That must be why I thought
she was so damn adorable.

977
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:22,872
Kang Kot-nim. She's the daughter
of a nanorobotic scientist

978
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,165
named Kang Hyeo-nu.

979
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,417
There. Your turn.

980
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,377
Does Dr. Kang still have the money?

981
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:32,089
- Money? What money?
- What is she talking about?

982
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,300
Damn, they're worse
at this than I thought.

983
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,054
Turn off the lights. Lock the door.

984
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,647
Black Foxes. Our deal isn't over yet.

985
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,149
I don't wanna hurt you guys.

986
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,318
So please tell me.

987
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,362
What the hell is going on here?

988
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:57,865
Little Black Fox,

989
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:01,243
hunted and caught in a trap
trying to escape with Dorothy.

990
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:02,787
Shoot him.

991
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,455
You will answer my question.

992
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:08,626
I will make you a UTS citizen,
effective immediately.

993
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,962
Oh, this man is going to die, anyway.

994
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,839
- You are sick.
- You see,

995
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,717
you talk about protecting the Earth,

996
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:19,720
but actually you want nothing
more than to be here in Eden.

997
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:22,890
And you resent the fact
that you weren't one of the chosen.

998
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,352
Why wouldn't you?
You can have everything here.

999
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:30,648
Clean air. Nice house. Friendly neighbors.

1000
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,651
Are you gonna let your family

1001
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:36,904
suffer in that hellhole
for the rest of their lives?

1002
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,997
Look. Look!

1003
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:51,210
You see what you just did?

1004
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,211
No…

1005
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,630
This is your true nature.

1006
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,718
Greed and hatred are engraved in your DNA.

1007
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,221
Did you really believe
you deserved a place in Eden?

1008
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,640
Answer me!

1009
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,103
You're a vile pollutant.

1010
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:13,065
You'll crawl into my paradise
and infect it with your filth.

1011
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:16,819
The world will never be a better place
while it's infested with scum like you.

1012
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,865
My job is to cleanse the infection.

1013
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:27,997
The future of humanity depends on it.

1014
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,014
The abductors and space sweepers,

1015
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:46,765
bring them to me.

1016
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,476
<i>The Black Foxes
are not terrorists.</i>

1017
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,770
We were an environmental organization

1018
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,065
until the Space Guards came down on us.

1019
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:56,817
We're the only survivors.

1020
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,944
Enough with the backstory.

1021
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:06,327
We've been following
this Mars program since the beginning.

1022
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,621
Don't you think it's strange?

1023
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:13,375
If Mars with its harsh environment
can be turned into green land,

1024
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:14,960
then why couldn't Earth be?

1025
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,966
<i>Dorothy isn't an ordinary child.</i>

1026
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:26,472
<i>She was born with a congenital illness
which destroys her nerves.</i>

1027
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:29,016
<i>Nobody had a cure. There was no hope.</i>

1028
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:35,814
<i>As a last resort, Dr. Kang
injected nanobots into her body.</i>

1029
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,567
<i>It was like a miracle.</i>

1030
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:43,197
<i>The nanobots repaired the nerves,
and Dorothy was able to walk again.</i>

1031
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:46,533
<i>But the real miracle would come later.</i>

1032
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:51,205
<i>The nanobots and Dorothy were programmed
to send signals to each other.</i>

1033
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,290
<i>But the nanobots went further</i>

1034
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:56,835
<i>and started talking to bots
outside her body, too.</i>

1035
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,673
{\an8}<i>Nobody knows how it's possible.
Not even Dr. Kang can explain it.</i>

1036
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:04,635
<i>She can make flowers blossom
on a dead tree.</i>

1037
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:09,682
<i>Here was a possibility
to bring life back to Earth.</i>

1038
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:16,397
But Sullivan took Dorothy to use her
in his Mars development project.

1039
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,650
He hadn't been getting anywhere before,
but now he's got this new power.

1040
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,735
That's how he turned Mars
into a tropical island.

1041
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:24,780
One genetically modified plant
changed Mars.

1042
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,032
But nothing can save Earth?
It's all bullshit.

1043
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,493
And the mass media
just repeats Sullivan's lies.

1044
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,056
And Kot-nim, what will happen to her?

1045
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,960
What do you think Sullivan's
gonna do with her?

1046
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:35,737
Well, as Mars became the only planet
where terraforming was possible,

1047
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,084
the miracle needed to disappear.

1048
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,711
They wiped away everything.

1049
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:42,047
Lab results, data,
the scientists who worked on the project.

1050
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,079
Kot-nim got out
before they could kill her.

1051
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:47,428
They can't kill Dorothy.
Dorothy gets protection from the nanobots.

1052
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:50,272
The only way to kill a nanobot
is to heat it over 200 million degrees…

1053
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,390
A hydrogen bomb.

1054
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,061
{\an8}There's a bomb inside
the Factory's anti-gravity engine.

1055
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:57,855
{\an8}A real one.

1056
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,817
{\an8}Dorothy will be taken there
and blown into subatomic particles.

1057
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,111
{\an8}<i>The Factory
will then crash into the Earth,</i>

1058
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:07,031
{\an8}<i>causing massive fractures
across the planet's crusts,</i>

1059
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:10,159
{\an8}<i>as well as tsunamis and nuclear fallouts.</i>

1060
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:13,829
<i>More than three billion people will die.</i>

1061
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:16,373
Sullivan is not
a savior of humanity.

1062
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:18,751
He wants to destroy everything on Earth!

1063
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:23,088
{\an8}- Is that a gunshot?
- Oh, what's going on?

1064
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,352
Why are you doing this to us?

1065
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,857
Hurry up already.

1066
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,984
We can go through
the mechanical room in the back.

1067
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,029
MR-13, block 27.

1068
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:49,311
I'm meeting Kang Hyeo-nu back there.
I'll see you there.

1069
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,908
We're gonna use the back door!

1070
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,077
Com on, Bubs.

1071
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,222
- You're with us.
- What about Kot-nim?

1072
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,373
I'll protect her.

1073
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,755
Just stay calm,
and we'll walk right outta here.

1074
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,050
Go!

1075
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:18,352
- You! Hold it...
- I'm not afraid of you!

1076
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:19,728
All done.

1077
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,231
What's wrong?

1078
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,699
- Hop on.
- Huh?

1079
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,369
Come on, hurry up already!

1080
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,586
Are you sure you want
to go in there? I just took a dump.

1081
01:13:45,462 --> 01:13:46,964
It's a pretty bad one.

1082
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,196
Bless you.

1083
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,990
Thank you, Uncle Tae-ho.

1084
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,968
Hey, Kot-nim, are you doing okay?

1085
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:36,388
Yeah, I'm okay. What about you,
Uncle Tae-ho? Are you okay?

1086
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,890
I'm okay.

1087
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,562
I got a 20 on Dorothy.

1088
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:45,731
Is it too late to change my answer?

1089
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:58,035
Hallway G-34. Suspect's vessel
is KOR SH 7901, Victory.

1090
01:14:58,118 --> 01:15:01,622
We'll be okay, Captain Jang.
Get out of here while you still can.

1091
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:04,124
You hear me, Captain Jang?

1092
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,637
Come on! What the fuck is going on?

1093
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,683
You bastards!

1094
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:26,271
I got Dorothy. Bridge D4.

1095
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,862
<i>Camilla is at bridge D6. Chasing.</i>

1096
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,704
Here we go, Kot-nim! Hold tight!

1097
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:56,051
No!

1098
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:58,387
No more crazy jumps!

1099
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,733
You better get inside, Kim Tae-ho!

1100
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:17,155
Hold on! I'll get the harpoon!

1101
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,577
Kot-nim!

1102
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,203
- No!
- Kot-nim!

1103
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,557
Move over! Let me fly.

1104
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:45,809
<i>We're in. Let's go!</i>

1105
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:05,621
Steady.

1106
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,918
Come on.

1107
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,721
<i>Entering Lagrangian Point
Space Debris Field.</i>

1108
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:23,804
No.

1109
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:27,818
- Oh, just what we need.
<i>- Alter course immediately.</i>

1110
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:42,991
<i>Steering malfunction.
Steering malfunction.</i>

1111
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:49,998
Everything will be okay.

1112
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:53,126
Keep your eyes closed. Don't open them.
Count to 100 for me.

1113
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:59,716
Oxygen leak in the main circuit!
The vent shaft is breached, too!

1114
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,967
Our engine's about to blow!

1115
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,442
Thirty-two, 33…

1116
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:21,780
<i>Warning. Warning.
Nanobot infestation detected.</i>

1117
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,270
<i>Evacuate ship.</i>

1118
01:18:37,337 --> 01:18:38,714
It's over.

1119
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:51,226
…78, 79…

1120
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:04,364
…95, 96…

1121
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:10,620
…99, 100.

1122
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,545
Kot-nim!

1123
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:03,131
Kot-nim!

1124
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,258
What… what do we do?
Her heart stopped beating.

1125
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:08,082
- Someone get the defibrillator.
- Hold on. I'll get it.

1126
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:11,807
Hey, everyone. Calm down, okay?
You need to stay calm! Calm down, please.

1127
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,005
- Why is this so disorganized?
- Gently.

1128
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:17,729
- Be gentle. Don't break her ribs!
- One, two, three, four.

1129
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:21,399
Five. Kot-nim!

1130
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:22,901
Six. Kot-nim!

1131
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,654
Seven. Kot-nim!

1132
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:26,738
Eight…

1133
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,658
Did she just…

1134
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,286
Who farted?

1135
01:20:34,871 --> 01:20:35,871
You.

1136
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,750
You little fart machine.

1137
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,130
She's a robot, after all.

1138
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:46,967
A fart robot!

1139
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,223
Hey, be honest.
You pooped a little, too.

1140
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:03,733
<i>- I do need to use the bathroom.</i>
<i>- We know.</i>

1141
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:07,779
<i>Departing Lagrangian Point.
All systems normal.</i>

1142
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:10,583
<i>The suspects are currently
aboard the spaceship Victory,</i>

1143
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:13,326
<i>plate number KOR 7901SH.</i>

1144
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,745
<i>They have been posing
as Korean space sweepers</i>

1145
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:18,736
<i>but are actually members of the infamous
Black Fox terrorist organization.</i>

1146
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:19,916
Famous.

1147
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,400
<i>They were responsible
for the nightclub massacre</i>

1148
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:23,699
<i>in the 32nd Commercial District,</i>

1149
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:27,132
<i>as well as the shooting on the Factory,
the waste management satellite.</i>

1150
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:29,593
<i>They are currently
in possession of Dorothy</i>

1151
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,636
<i>and are on the run from authorities.</i>

1152
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:34,180
<i>They're all Korean.</i>

1153
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,475
<i>Jang Hyun-sook. Adopted through
the UTS Genius Program</i>

1154
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,102
<i>and trained as an engineer.</i>

1155
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:41,730
<i>As a student, she developed 4D AR lenses</i>

1156
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:44,983
<i>in addition to lightweight laser blasters
and EMP mines.</i>

1157
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:49,112
<i>At age 19, she deserted the colony
to form a pirate organization</i>

1158
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:51,740
<i>after becoming immersed
in anti-UTS ideology.</i>

1159
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:55,702
<i>She attempted and failed to assassinate
UTS CEO James Sullivan,</i>

1160
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:58,288
<i>during which attempt
all of her crew members died.</i>

1161
01:21:58,371 --> 01:22:00,957
<i>She's suspected to be living
under a false identity</i>

1162
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:03,877
<i>after undergoing eye replacement surgery.</i>

1163
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,960
<i>Park Kyung-soo.</i>

1164
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,049
<i>Until four years ago, he led
a sizable drug cartel on Earth,</i>

1165
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,967
<i>fled the planet to avoid capture,</i>

1166
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:13,511
<i>and is now illegally
residing in the orbit.</i>

1167
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,514
<i>No one else knows, but he was
sentenced to death before fleeing,</i>

1168
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:20,101
<i>and if he ever returns to Earth,
he will be promptly executed.</i>

1169
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:24,648
<i>Kim Tae-ho. The first-ever UTS Genius.</i>

1170
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:27,692
<i>The only adoptee you carried
into UTS in your arms.</i>

1171
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,111
<i>Also the inaugural commander
of the Space Guard.</i>

1172
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:34,532
<i>At age 17, he reset the records
for flight speed missions completed…</i>

1173
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,454
What a sick twist of fate.

1174
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,746
<i>We're two hours late
for the handoff.</i>

1175
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,959
<i>He'll be there.
Kang Hyeo-nu has nowhere else to go.</i>

1176
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,711
<i>Kot-nim is with us.</i>

1177
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:31,506
<i>We just need to get down
to Earth's airspace, then it's game over.</i>

1178
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:33,341
<i>Sullivan can't touch us there.</i>

1179
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:38,263
Kang Hyeo-nu, the Black Foxes,
Kot-nim, Bubs, you, and Park.

1180
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,974
- Once we're all together, we'll head down.
- No way.

1181
01:23:44,644 --> 01:23:45,884
I don't like waiting that long.

1182
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:47,857
Those Space Guard assholes
could show up anytime.

1183
01:23:47,939 --> 01:23:49,941
Let's just head down to Earth right now.

1184
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:53,286
- We need to keep Kot-nim safe.
- What the heck are you talking about?

1185
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:54,921
We can't go anywhere without the money.

1186
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:58,450
No more stupid ideas, okay?

1187
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:11,671
I gotta work in here.
Go hang out with Captain Jang.

1188
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,798
Uncle Tae-ho,
you wanna know something?

1189
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:17,260
There's no up or down in space.

1190
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:21,139
Nothing out here is better
or worse than anything else.

1191
01:24:23,349 --> 01:24:27,353
That's because everything out here
has its special place.

1192
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:28,605
Who told you that?

1193
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:30,065
That's what Dad always says.

1194
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:37,238
Hey, Kang Kot-nim, how come
you haven't drawn me yet?

1195
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:40,158
You were the first person
I drew, Uncle Tae-ho.

1196
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,243
I didn't show you
because I was scared of you.

1197
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:50,043
Why don't we put this up somewhere?

1198
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:56,216
Anyway, if you wanna draw,
just do it over there, please.

1199
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:57,979
Make sure your stuff doesn't get all over.

1200
01:24:58,009 --> 01:25:00,303
- Uncle Tae-ho, your shoes.
- What about them?

1201
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:01,386
They broke.

1202
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:08,186
I know that Su-ni was your daughter.

1203
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:13,149
Why don't we go and see her
together one day?

1204
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:19,614
I don't know where she is,
but we can still see her.

1205
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:24,702
Has anyone seen Kot-nim? Anyone?

1206
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,913
Where is she hiding now,
that little rascal?

1207
01:25:26,996 --> 01:25:29,040
Park's looking for you, I think.

1208
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:42,679
- That's too cold!
- Sorry.

1209
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:45,849
Uh, let's see.

1210
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:48,268
How about now?

1211
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:49,227
It's warm.

1212
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:51,896
Oh? Great.

1213
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,982
All right. Why don't we try
washing your hair?

1214
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:57,819
Kot-nim, we wanna make sure
you're nice and clean for your dad.

1215
01:25:57,902 --> 01:25:59,320
Close your eyes.

1216
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,282
You should put
a bucket underneath!

1217
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,332
Come on, Park, you're doing it wrong.

1218
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,878
Why don't you mind your own
business before I get pissed off, huh?

1219
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:18,047
Hey, let me see. I'll show you.

1220
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,049
What are you doing?
She's not a newborn baby.

1221
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,573
I'm doing fine, thank you very much.

1222
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:24,000
- Let me show you.
- Why are you bothering us?

1223
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,430
- What can you show me?
- Come on!

1224
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,795
- You'll get water up her nose.
- Like hell I will.

1225
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:30,268
Give me back the hose.
See? That is what you wanted?

1226
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:32,049
- Leave us alone.
- Kot-nim, get out of here.

1227
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:33,897
- Aight!
- This is ridiculous. Hey!

1228
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,274
Just quit it! Stop! Wait!

1229
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:39,736
Hey! My eyes! Hey! Stand still.

1230
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:42,322
Hey! What are you guys doing?

1231
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:44,324
Get out.

1232
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,480
- This is all your fault.
- I was just gonna show you.

1233
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:48,816
- Shut up and get out.
- You ever raised a kid?

1234
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:50,330
What experience do you have?

1235
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:51,819
Oh, I have plenty.

1236
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:56,002
Kot-nim, here's some soap.
Close your eyes.

1237
01:26:56,085 --> 01:26:58,588
Do those idiots think water
is cheap or something?

1238
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:02,634
Is Uncle Tae-ho angry again?
Is he mad because of Su-ni?

1239
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:03,718
I don't know.

1240
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,304
<i>There it is!</i>

1241
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:11,309
<i>Arriving at MR-13 in five minutes.</i>

1242
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,728
<i>Switching to manual pilot.</i>

1243
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:25,990
<i>Hello?</i>

1244
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:27,825
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Karum?

1245
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,620
<i>Can you hear me? Anyone hear me?</i>

1246
01:27:30,703 --> 01:27:32,664
We can hear you! We can hear you!

1247
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:35,250
- Where is Dr. Kang?
<i>- I just picked him up.</i>

1248
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,668
<i>I am with him now.</i>

1249
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:39,045
<i>He was already there when I came.</i>

1250
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:40,672
Yeah!

1251
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,298
<i>- Hurry up.</i>
- Okay.

1252
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,634
<i>We're going in now.</i>

1253
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:47,512
<i>Karum, your GPS is off, right?</i>

1254
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:50,181
<i>- Yeah, it's off.</i>
<i>- Can you double-check?</i>

1255
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,433
<i>You won't find me on your radar.</i>

1256
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,811
<i>I flew in here with my eyes alone.</i>

1257
01:27:54,894 --> 01:27:58,273
<i>Let's be careful.
No trouble this time.</i>

1258
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,983
<i>Where are we going?</i>

1259
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:01,401
We're going to meet your dad.

1260
01:28:01,484 --> 01:28:02,860
No way!

1261
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:05,488
He's there? Is he really?

1262
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:15,957
<i>Okay, okay, we see Victory.
We see Victory now.</i>

1263
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,250
<i>Do you see us?</i>

1264
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:18,668
Yes, I see you now.

1265
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:19,836
I see you.

1266
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:41,858
- Hey, Dad!
- Kot-nim!

1267
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,526
- Daddy!
- Kot-nim!

1268
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,698
I missed you.

1269
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:56,414
I'm so sorry, baby. Daddy's so sorry.

1270
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,376
Kot-nim, you must be starved.

1271
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,294
No, I'm full.

1272
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:05,131
Captain Jang gave me some hot sauce
and made dinner really yummy.

1273
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:08,551
Bubs put makeup on me,
but all of it is gone now.

1274
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:13,639
Uncle Tiger fixed the hole
of my sock and washed my hair for me.

1275
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:18,519
And Uncle Tae-ho and I
made $23 from selling our tomatoes.

1276
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,271
Can you believe that?

1277
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,106
Thanks to all of you. Thank you so much.

1278
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,361
Good job.

1279
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:29,530
- We did it.
- I'm so happy she is with good people.

1280
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:31,991
She is so beautiful.
Look at her. Look at her.

1281
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:36,913
Tae-ho, my man.

1282
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,624
We did it. Look at this.

1283
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:42,794
We did it!

1284
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:44,712
I need to talk to you.

1285
01:29:47,673 --> 01:29:48,966
Where is it?

1286
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,134
It's in the ship.

1287
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,780
You sure there's two million in there?

1288
01:29:52,845 --> 01:29:54,305
Don't worry, you'll get your money.

1289
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,789
Okay, but I have to make sure
it's all there. You understand?

1290
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:59,977
That's enough about the money.
We'll deal with that later.

1291
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,897
I can't show you right now.
Not in front of the kid.

1292
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:04,982
Just go bring the bag!
That's your job.

1293
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,906
Since when
am I in charge of the money?

1294
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:09,362
Just go get the money.
What's so hard about that?

1295
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:12,490
- Guys, take this outside.
- Chill out. It'll be fine.

1296
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:23,667
EMP explosives.

1297
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,720
<i>All systems shutting down,
excluding crew life support.</i>

1298
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:38,850
<i>Reboot in progress.
Estimated time, three minutes.</i>

1299
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:40,101
Get the engine running.

1300
01:30:42,562 --> 01:30:43,562
Bubs!

1301
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:55,267
<i>Take Dorothy</i>
<i>and the Victory crew alive.</i>

1302
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:56,742
<i>Eliminate everyone else.</i>

1303
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:03,332
Karum!

1304
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:07,795
Daddy! Daddy!

1305
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:10,006
- Get away!
- Daddy!

1306
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:16,596
Daddy!

1307
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:17,847
Kot-nim!

1308
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:22,977
- Kot-nim!
- Kot-nim!

1309
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:25,771
Daddy, help me!

1310
01:31:57,386 --> 01:31:58,846
No, please!

1311
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:42,640
How nice to see you all again.

1312
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,317
Park, Bubs, and Tae-ho, I'm…

1313
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:55,820
I'm sorry.

1314
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:07,915
Captain Jang!

1315
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,084
She is the only one
that ever got close enough

1316
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:13,004
to aim a gun in my face.

1317
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:17,383
It's been your lifelong dream
to kill me, hasn't it?

1318
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:26,100
Come on. Come on, give it to me.

1319
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:31,897
Still hanging on to the dream, I see.

1320
01:33:36,652 --> 01:33:39,572
{\an8}No!

1321
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:45,453
Never thought I would see
the great Commander Kim Tae-ho

1322
01:33:45,536 --> 01:33:47,371
living in such squalor.

1323
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:50,916
Not that it doesn't suit you.
It does. Really.

1324
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,047
It was right here, wasn't it?

1325
01:33:56,922 --> 01:33:58,174
Three years ago.

1326
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:00,843
The place where you lost your daughter.

1327
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:03,512
Ah…

1328
01:34:04,096 --> 01:34:07,308
I'm gonna make Dorothy
disappear with the Factory.

1329
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:10,102
"Giant mass of space junk falls to Earth!"

1330
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,647
"Earth destroyed by catastrophic impact!"

1331
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,857
"‘Earth beyond saving!"

1332
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,902
Everyone will think it was
the Black Foxes anyway.

1333
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:21,572
Who cares if a billion lives are lost?
Genetic defects.

1334
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:27,703
Dr. Kang was unable to keep
his side of the bargain, but I will.

1335
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,708
I'm prepared to pay double. Four million.

1336
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,461
The money's yours.

1337
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:39,715
Are you gonna let your daughter
drift in space forever?

1338
01:34:40,424 --> 01:34:41,884
Time's running out, Tae-ho.

1339
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:45,261
Come on.

1340
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:48,224
Come on.

1341
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:55,022
Take the money

1342
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:58,275
and find Su-ni.

1343
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,744
The price of Dorothy's life.

1344
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:12,415
You knew, and you still took it.

1345
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:19,964
I want this engraved
in your heart forever.

1346
01:35:21,757 --> 01:35:25,594
Now do you see who you really are?

1347
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:29,265
You are no good man.

1348
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:33,310
You will never be a better person.

1349
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:36,772
You just lost your chance
to ever become one.

1350
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:38,274
Smile.

1351
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:41,652
Turn those frowns upside down!

1352
01:35:43,195 --> 01:35:44,822
You just won the lottery!

1353
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:50,578
The charges have all
been dropped as of this moment.

1354
01:35:58,252 --> 01:36:02,339
<i>Victory. System reboot complete.</i>

1355
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:12,975
Don't kill them just yet.

1356
01:36:13,058 --> 01:36:15,269
I want them to see the Factory fall.

1357
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:17,855
The death of their planet.

1358
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,649
Then you can kill them.

1359
01:36:35,372 --> 01:36:38,250
<i>My dear UTS citizens.</i>

1360
01:36:39,835 --> 01:36:45,090
<i>Today, we take another step
forward together</i>

1361
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,260
<i>towards a new space age.</i>

1362
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:52,848
<i>Today, I present to you</i>

1363
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:55,226
<i>the home,</i>

1364
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,772
<i>the answer to our quest</i>

1365
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:05,319
<i>for eternal happiness and prosperity.</i>

1366
01:37:07,404 --> 01:37:08,572
<i>Mars.</i>

1367
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,793
Beautiful.

1368
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:26,048
My cut's ten, like we agreed.

1369
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:33,334
What, you don't want it anymore?

1370
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:35,724
That money is filthy.

1371
01:37:35,808 --> 01:37:37,476
Forget it, then.

1372
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,854
Jang, Bubs, you guys split his share.

1373
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,857
How can you even think
about touching that money?

1374
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:43,816
Got another way to pay
this month's interest?

1375
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:46,819
What about fuel, oxygen, and water?

1376
01:37:46,902 --> 01:37:49,029
The insurance payments and the taxes, huh?

1377
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:51,949
The whole ship belongs to the bank.

1378
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:54,285
But I forgot. You don't need money.

1379
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:57,955
Let's face it, we'll never be free.

1380
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:01,333
No matter how hard we work,
there's always more debt, am I right?

1381
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:04,420
I'm not giving up on her.
Kot-nim is still at the Factory.

1382
01:38:04,503 --> 01:38:06,263
It's far,
so the engine will need to warm up.

1383
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:07,172
Park, listen.

1384
01:38:07,256 --> 01:38:09,466
I'll keep everything running.
One of you can fly.

1385
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:11,677
If we go there, we die.
You understand that?

1386
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,764
I don't care about that.
I'm willing to die.

1387
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:19,310
Kim Tae-ho, there's things you have to do.

1388
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:22,980
Park and I will take care of this mission,
so go.

1389
01:38:24,481 --> 01:38:25,816
Go and find your daughter.

I guess you've been through
a lot since the last time I saw you.

1395
01:39:10,235 --> 01:39:11,528
Just take the money.

1396
01:39:13,572 --> 01:39:15,366
400,000?

1397
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:16,617
Wait right here, sir!

1398
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,953
We can get a search craft deployed
in five minutes.

1399
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:22,247
For that money, we can find
your loved one in 24 hours!

Congratulations. You finally did it.

DADDY. SU-NI LOVES YOU THE BEST.
I LOVE YOU WHEN I EAT,

1405
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:28,981
PUT ON SHOES, DO LAUNDRY. I WANT
TO BECOME A GOOD PERSON LIKE YOU.

1406
01:40:33,902 --> 01:40:37,239
You bastard! You think
you can cheat me, huh Fuck you!

1407
01:40:37,322 --> 01:40:39,158
Hey, hey, guys, guys. Calm down.

1408
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:40,534
It's just a game, okay?

1409
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,915
She can't talk,
but she can fight, huh?

1410
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:53,297
Hey, Daddy.

1411
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:54,757
Can you go play outside?

1412
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:57,801
Look, I made this for you.

1413
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,136
Go buy a snack, okay?

1414
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:20,324
I WANT TO BECOME A GOOD PERSON

1415
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:33,248
For years, all they
wanna talk about is money.

1416
01:41:33,295 --> 01:41:34,505
Now we're throwing it out?

1417
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:35,881
I think I'm crazy or something.

1418
01:41:35,964 --> 01:41:37,216
Hey, you're back!

1419
01:41:37,299 --> 01:41:39,456
- What? Why would you...
- I guess I'm crazy now.

1420
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:42,012
Hey, Park, fill up the tank.

1421
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:44,263
Tae-ho?

1422
01:41:47,726 --> 01:41:49,645
I just remembered a promise I made.

1423
01:41:49,728 --> 01:41:52,523
- What promise was that?
- What are you doing in my seat?

1424
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:54,108
Get out!

1425
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:06,787
<i>It's been a long time, Captain.</i>

1426
01:42:12,334 --> 01:42:14,294
Oh, boy.

1427
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:15,838
We're actually doing this.

<i>Rear hatch gravity level, 1.2 Gs.</i>

<i>Magnetic compensation, 0.5 Gs.</i>

1430
01:42:41,071 --> 01:42:41,989
Hit it.

<i>Camilla, Victory is escaping.
They are intercepting our missile.</i>

There's too many of them.

1433
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:19,943
<i>Laser gun. Rear hatch.</i>

1434
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:26,408
Close the valve now!

01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:38,086
Bubs, I need some help here.

1436
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:29,221
We're almost done, Bubs.
Everyone hang in there. Come on.

1437
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:41,984
Oh, no! My harpoon!

1438
01:44:58,875 --> 01:45:00,210
<i>Good work, Bubs.</i>

1439
01:45:00,752 --> 01:45:02,337
Clear.

1440
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:14,433
They keep coming.

1441
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,936
<i>Rebooting. Rebooting.</i>

1442
01:45:21,898 --> 01:45:24,318
Park, I need one last favor.

1443
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,579
I want everything
out of those engines, okay?

1444
01:45:27,612 --> 01:45:28,947
You can count on me.

1445
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:33,618
Uh, what's he doing?

1446
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:37,706
Kim Tae-ho, you better not kill us!

1447
01:46:01,271 --> 01:46:02,814
Park, come on.

1448
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:04,483
I'm almost there!

1449
01:46:07,944 --> 01:46:09,404
Just one more.

1450
01:46:18,538 --> 01:46:20,123
<i>It's done!</i>

1451
01:46:33,512 --> 01:46:34,512
Push it, Park!

1452
01:47:12,592 --> 01:47:14,594
They are headed
to the anti-gravity sphere.

1453
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:16,638
Our Special Forces Squad have failed to…

1454
01:47:20,767 --> 01:47:23,145
<i>Kim Tae-ho, you have a plan
to get us out of this?</i>

1455
01:47:23,228 --> 01:47:24,813
<i>I don't think he does.</i>

1456
01:47:24,896 --> 01:47:26,982
<i>Don't think. Just step on it!</i>

1457
01:47:51,756 --> 01:47:52,883
Is that the bomb?

1458
01:47:56,094 --> 01:47:58,722
If that thing goes off,
we're all dead meat.

1459
01:48:07,689 --> 01:48:08,899
Captain Jang?

1460
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:12,235
- Are you all right?
- Kot-nim! Kot-nim!

1461
01:48:13,862 --> 01:48:15,238
There you are!

1462
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:18,533
Uncle Tiger, can you tell me
where my daddy is?

1463
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:20,869
Why don't we just
get you out of here, okay?

1464
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:30,921
- "Krypton."
- Where is she?

1465
01:48:45,727 --> 01:48:48,980
Thank God we found her.
Kot-nim, come on. Let's go.

1466
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:50,315
There's no use. It's hopeless.

1467
01:48:50,398 --> 01:48:52,817
When the bomb goes off,
it'll send out Krypton waves

1468
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:55,320
within a radius of 5,000km.

1469
01:48:55,403 --> 01:48:57,364
Every nanobot within that distance
will shut down.

1470
01:48:57,447 --> 01:49:00,021
- What are you talking about?
- Kot-nim, let's go. Come on!

1471
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:01,033
I'm saying that

1472
01:49:02,285 --> 01:49:05,497
even if she survives,
the disease will kill her.

1473
01:49:06,289 --> 01:49:08,124
We won't be able to save her,
no matter what.

1474
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:10,365
What are you talking about?
We need to defuse the bomb.

1475
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:12,379
If it doesn't explode,
she'll be fine, right?

1476
01:49:12,462 --> 01:49:13,964
We can't stop it.

1477
01:49:14,047 --> 01:49:17,551
They put the detonator inside the bomb.
It will go off the second I hack in.

1478
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:20,345
No matter what, that bomb will explode.

1479
01:49:21,638 --> 01:49:23,640
And the Factory will crash into Earth.

1480
01:49:26,017 --> 01:49:27,352
We can't do anything about that.

1481
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:30,438
Captain Jang,
why are you talking like this?

1482
01:49:30,522 --> 01:49:32,983
We need to keep thinking! Think!

1483
01:49:33,483 --> 01:49:35,193
If we got her far enough…

1484
01:49:35,902 --> 01:49:40,156
If we can take Kot-nim
far enough away from the explosion,

1485
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,076
would that be enough to save her?

1486
01:49:43,159 --> 01:49:44,691
If she's out of range
of the Krypton emission.

1487
01:49:44,703 --> 01:49:47,706
- How far?
- 5,132km.

1488
01:49:58,049 --> 01:49:59,217
It's the only chance we have.

1489
01:50:00,594 --> 01:50:02,137
Then that's what we do.

1490
01:50:06,182 --> 01:50:07,182
Get her on the ship.

1491
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:11,062
- Kot-nim.
- We don't have a lot of time.

1492
01:50:11,146 --> 01:50:12,606
But I'll go as fast as I can.

1493
01:50:15,483 --> 01:50:16,818
Uncle Tae-ho!

1494
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:38,340
Listen to me. Run away as fast as you can.
You'll see the ship.

1495
01:50:38,423 --> 01:50:41,217
- Just wait for me inside.
- What's going to happen to you?

1496
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:44,471
Stay in the ship, and I'll bring
everyone back with me, yeah?

1497
01:50:46,681 --> 01:50:48,933
Touch her, and I'll kill you,
you ugly bitch.

1498
01:51:09,037 --> 01:51:10,080
Kot-nim!

1499
01:51:11,164 --> 01:51:12,832
You kids should stay out of this.

1500
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:17,545
I'm the only one here who can handle her.

1501
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:21,215
Park, what are you...

1502
01:51:38,608 --> 01:51:39,984
Hey, Park!

1503
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:37,834
You wanna steal the girl,
then I'll take something from you.

1504
01:52:52,515 --> 01:52:55,059
- You've asked for one. Still warm.
- It is warm.

1505
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:56,978
That's a real hand!

1506
01:52:57,979 --> 01:53:01,232
- Thank you. Thank you, Tiger Park.
- SNICKERS:

1507

Take your time.</i>

1508

1512
01:53:24,964 --> 01:53:27,008

01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:32,013
Hey, Park, is the emergency radio on?

1515
01:53:32,096 --> 01:53:33,576
Emergency channel! Emergency channel!

1516

Oh, it's already on.

1518

<i>- You reading me?</i>
- We heard everything!

1520
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:45,276
We need to go help Captain Jang!

1521
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:48,780
You think I'm calling for myself?
You have no idea what's going on, do you?

1522
01:53:48,863 --> 01:53:50,198
Listen to me carefully.

1523
01:53:50,698 --> 01:53:54,619
<i>The Factory is about to explode

<i>It won't just be a small accident.</i>

1526
01:54:02,293 --> 01:54:03,920
<i>It will destroy us all.</i>

1527

you've got it in you. Please.

01:54:34,117 --> 01:54:35,743
<i>Incoming attack drones.</i>

1536
01:54:35,827 --> 01:54:37,579
<i>Incoming attack drones.</i>

1537
01:54:38,371 --> 01:54:41,040
- Pierre?
- Captain Jang! It's me!

1538
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:43,001
I'll do anything.

1539
01:54:43,084 --> 01:54:44,844
I<i> can give my life to it!</i>

1540
01:54:44,878 --> 01:54:48,131
My God, that young man is really
obsessed. Save it for later, you two.

1541
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:56,931
<i>Park, you ready?</i>

1542
01:54:57,015 --> 01:54:58,775
<i>There's…
There's just so many of them.</i>

1543
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:00,935
<i>Stop whining, Tiger Park! Let's go!</i>

1544
01:55:05,857 --> 01:55:07,191
Pierre, out of the way!

1545
01:55:42,977 --> 01:55:46,189
All right. Space Sweepers,
show me what you can do.

1546
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,001
<i>Get it!</i>

1547
01:56:19,263 --> 01:56:20,765
<i>Is that all you got?</i>

1548
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,737
<i>Damn! I almost lost it there.</i>

1549
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:36,656
<i>Shit!</i>

1550
01:56:45,915 --> 01:56:47,166
Ha ha!

1551
01:56:49,585 --> 01:56:51,504
<i>One is on their tail!</i>

1552
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:03,975
<i>Got you, bastard!</i>

1553
01:57:05,226 --> 01:57:06,894
<i>Attack drones are battling…</i>

1554
01:57:06,978 --> 01:57:09,313
<i>What? Right now?</i>

1555
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:11,733
<i>This just in.
A shocking audio was just heard</i>

1556
01:57:11,816 --> 01:57:14,444
{\an8}<i>through the emergency channel
of space sweepers.</i>

1557
01:57:14,527 --> 01:57:16,600
{\an8}<i>"Giant mass
of space junk falls to Earth!"</i>

1558
01:57:16,612 --> 01:57:19,032
<i>"Earth destroyed by catastrophic impact!"</i>

1559
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:21,075
<i>Everyone will think it was
the Black Foxes anyway.</i>

1560
01:57:21,117 --> 01:57:24,037
<i>Who cares if a billion lives are lost?
It's genetic defects.</i>

1561
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,788
<i>Who cares if a billion lives are lost?</i>

1562
01:57:25,872 --> 01:57:27,457
<i>Who cares if a billion lives are lost?</i>

1563
01:57:32,545 --> 01:57:34,338
Come on…

1564
01:57:35,298 --> 01:57:36,174
Kot-nim, are you okay?

1565
01:57:36,257 --> 01:57:39,218
<i>- She didn't get hurt, right?</i>
<i>- Don't worry.</i>

1566
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:43,014
Our little fart machine
is safe inside the container.

1567
01:57:52,982 --> 01:57:54,067
Surprise!

1568
01:58:34,732 --> 01:58:35,983
No!

1569
01:58:38,194 --> 01:58:39,570
- Captain Jang!
- Captain Jang!

1570
01:58:42,448 --> 01:58:45,243
<i>- Where are you hiding her?</i>
- That's not good.

1571
01:58:45,326 --> 01:58:46,326
She's mine!

1572
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:50,456
Worthless space junk!

1573
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:54,376
Shit!

1574
01:59:02,009 --> 01:59:04,262
{\an8}It's too slow. Park!

1575
01:59:04,929 --> 01:59:06,639
Divert the fuel to the emergency booster!

1576
01:59:06,722 --> 01:59:09,308
The booster only lasts 20 seconds!
That's all!

1577
01:59:09,392 --> 01:59:10,685
That should be enough.

1578
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:14,188
Fuck! Bubs!

1579
01:59:14,272 --> 01:59:16,357
You gotta release the booster
from outside!

1580
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,483
Got you!

1581
01:59:21,696 --> 01:59:22,696
Bubs!

1582
02:00:05,907 --> 02:00:06,907
Where is she?

1583
02:00:10,578 --> 02:00:11,621
Where is Dorothy?

1584
02:00:24,258 --> 02:00:27,970
<i>More than three billion
people are expected to die on Earth</i>

1585
02:00:28,054 --> 02:00:28,888
{\an8}<i>if the Factory falls.</i>

1586
02:00:28,971 --> 02:00:31,224
{\an8}<i>Unfortunately, defusing
is no longer an option.</i>

1587
02:00:31,307 --> 02:00:33,505
<i>- All access to the factory…</i>
- What happened?

1588
02:00:33,517 --> 02:00:34,977
<i>…has been banned by UTS.</i>

1589
02:00:35,061 --> 02:00:38,481
<i>A catastrophic end
seems inevitable for Earth.</i>

1590
02:00:48,407 --> 02:00:49,575
Tae-ho, are you okay?

1591
02:00:58,042 --> 02:01:01,045
Captain Jang, Park, and Bubs.

1592
02:01:03,297 --> 02:01:04,966
Flying with you has been a great honor.

1593
02:01:05,549 --> 02:01:07,468
You guys are the best team I ever had.

1594
02:01:08,469 --> 02:01:09,595
And my best friends.

1595
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,265
You guys know I love you, right?

1596
02:01:14,183 --> 02:01:15,183
Where is she?

1597
02:01:19,188 --> 02:01:20,564
Give her to me!

1598
02:01:42,169 --> 02:01:43,379
Kang Kot-nim…

1599
02:01:45,131 --> 02:01:47,174
She was never here, you monster.

1600
02:01:47,758 --> 02:01:51,554
<i>The bomb is about to go off,
so let's take it as far away as possible.</i>

1601
02:01:51,637 --> 02:01:53,514
<i>What?
And leave Kot-nim at the Factory?</i>

1602
02:01:53,597 --> 02:01:55,224
Captain Jang! It's me!

1603
02:01:55,308 --> 02:01:59,020
<i>No, we'll send her with Pierre
right before we make our escape.</i>

1604
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:01,647
Will you be okay without me?

1605
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:04,567
We have a job to do.
I promise we'll be fine.

1606
02:02:05,276 --> 02:02:08,571
<i>So we act as bait
so Kot-nim can get out alive?</i>

1607
02:02:08,654 --> 02:02:10,156
<i>Sounds like a suicide mission.</i>

1608
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:12,074
<i>This is the only way.</i>

1609
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:14,076
Take care, Kot-nim, dear.

1610
02:02:20,583 --> 02:02:23,753
<i>We have to get the bomb
at least 5,000km away from here.</i>

1611
02:02:23,836 --> 02:02:25,921
<i>It's the only way she'll survive.</i>

1612
02:02:26,005 --> 02:02:28,549
<i>The only way Earth will survive.</i>

1613
02:02:35,097 --> 02:02:36,182
We actually did it.

1614
02:02:42,688 --> 02:02:43,731
<i>No.</i>

1615
02:02:47,026 --> 02:02:48,026
<i>Why?</i>

1616
02:02:50,863 --> 02:02:52,406
<i>This isn't possible.</i>

1617
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:57,161
<i>I did everything right.</i>

1618
02:03:16,097 --> 02:03:17,598
<i>Wait. What?</i>

1619
02:03:17,681 --> 02:03:19,475
<i>What? What happened?</i>

1620
02:03:19,558 --> 02:03:21,358
<i>The bomb exploded in outer space!</i>

1621
02:03:21,435 --> 02:03:24,897
<i>The Factory did not fall.
Earth has survived.</i>

1622
02:03:57,638 --> 02:03:58,806
<i>What is that?</i>

1623
02:03:59,682 --> 02:04:02,017
<i>They're Lagrangian nanobots.</i>

1624
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:04,228
<i>The indestructibles</i>.

1625
02:04:29,587 --> 02:04:30,617
- Is Bubs okay?
- We did it.

1626
02:04:30,629 --> 02:04:33,132
<i>He's fine.
Well, at least his head is.</i>

1627
02:04:33,215 --> 02:04:35,676
<i>It'll cost a fortune to get him repaired.</i>

1628
02:04:36,218 --> 02:04:39,805
<i>And what was all that?
"Flying with you was an honor"?</i>

1629
02:04:39,889 --> 02:04:42,099
<i>"You're my best friends"?</i>

1630
02:04:42,683 --> 02:04:44,810
<i>"You guys know that I love you"?</i>

1631
02:04:45,394 --> 02:04:47,771
Oof! Gotta say that was
all pretty cringey, huh?

1632
02:04:56,238 --> 02:04:58,358
<i>People around the world
are still reeling</i>

1633
02:04:58,407 --> 02:05:00,159
<i>from the shocking revelations.</i>

1634
02:05:00,242 --> 02:05:02,286
<i>We now know that the Super Plant Project,</i>

1635
02:05:02,369 --> 02:05:05,664
<i>which was conceived originally
as an effort to save the Earth…</i>

1636
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:09,752
{\an8}<i>UTS just released a statement
apologizing for its cover-up.</i>

1637
02:05:09,835 --> 02:05:13,047
{\an8}<i>It also promised to widen its efforts
in rehabilitating the Earth</i>

1638
02:05:13,130 --> 02:05:15,382
{\an8}<i>and restoring harmony
across the solar system.</i>

1639
02:05:15,466 --> 02:05:17,186
<i>As for the brave
space sweepers</i>

1640
02:05:17,218 --> 02:05:19,512
<i>who averted what could
have been a mega-disaster,</i>

1641
02:05:19,595 --> 02:05:22,097
<i>UTS said it would provide
immediate reparations</i>

1642
02:05:22,181 --> 02:05:24,683
<i>for any damages or casualties suffered.</i>

1643
02:05:40,616 --> 02:05:42,201
Where's my money at, little piggy?

1644
02:05:44,995 --> 02:05:47,373
- Do… Do I know you?
- Recognize me?

1645
02:05:47,456 --> 02:05:49,041
It's Bubs, who you ripped off.

1646
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:53,462
Porky, that idiot.

1647
02:05:54,004 --> 02:05:56,404
Caught him in a casino
gambling away your money.

1648
02:05:58,676 --> 02:06:00,516
- Give me the money.
- Yes, pay up!

1649
02:06:01,512 --> 02:06:04,515
I was talking to you. Go get it, please.

1650
02:06:04,598 --> 02:06:06,308
Right.

1651
02:06:07,518 --> 02:06:10,980
It's a 99.99 percent DNA match.

1652
02:06:11,063 --> 02:06:13,399
We won't know Su-ni's location,

1653
02:06:13,482 --> 02:06:17,903
but Kot-nim will be able to communicate
with the nanobots in her vicinity.

1654
02:06:17,987 --> 02:06:20,573
Now, the nanobots we inserted
into your cranial nerves

1655
02:06:20,656 --> 02:06:24,326
will receive the data and interpret them
through your sensory system.

1656
02:06:25,619 --> 02:06:28,080
Now, we don't know
what form the data will take

1657
02:06:28,163 --> 02:06:31,208
or just exactly
how the interpretation process works.

1658
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:37,798
But we do know that for that one moment,
you and Su-ni will be connected.

1659
02:06:38,674 --> 02:06:40,884
And Dorothy will be your medium.

1660
02:06:40,968 --> 02:06:42,469
We're synced up.

1661
02:06:54,607 --> 02:06:57,943
<i>This is Su-ni
at this exact moment.</i>

1662
02:07:28,474 --> 02:07:30,893
{\an8}Dad, look. I'm done with it all.

1663
02:07:30,976 --> 02:07:32,728
You're all done, huh?

1664
02:07:34,188 --> 02:07:35,481
Come on, then. Show it to me.

1665
02:07:35,564 --> 02:07:38,108
{\an8}WRITING KOREAN

1666
02:07:46,867 --> 02:07:48,702
Wow, you did a great job.

1667
02:07:59,046 --> 02:08:00,798
Hey, Su-ni, can you give me a hug?

1668
02:08:06,303 --> 02:08:07,429
I'm sorry.

1669
02:08:08,138 --> 02:08:09,598
I'm sorry I took so long.

1670
02:08:12,226 --> 02:08:15,521
I'm so happy you came back to me.

1671
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:23,112
See you later, Daddy.

1672
02:08:26,448 --> 02:08:27,448
Kim Su-ni.

1673
02:08:28,242 --> 02:08:31,787
Departed the orbit at 17:42 hours,

1674
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:34,289
September 3rd, 2092.

1675
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:40,879
You've been slacking.

1676
02:08:40,963 --> 02:08:42,883
Keep it up, and I'll send you
to boarding school.

1677
02:08:42,923 --> 02:08:44,717
- Good idea.
- Stop. Don't be ridiculous.

1678
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:47,970
It's not ridiculous. She needs to learn
how to take some responsibility.

1679
02:08:48,804 --> 02:08:51,140
You should see how these other moms
handle their kids.

1680
02:08:51,223 --> 02:08:52,903
They have tutors,
extra-curricular and all.

1681
02:08:52,933 --> 02:08:53,767
That's right.

1682
02:08:53,851 --> 02:08:55,691
You want her to grow up
thinking we don't care?

1683
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:57,646
I'm not saying we shouldn't do anything.

1684
02:08:57,730 --> 02:09:00,649
Hey, Kot-nim! You want us
to send you to boarding school?

1685
02:09:01,275 --> 02:09:02,735
See? She doesn't want to.

1686
02:09:02,818 --> 02:09:04,820
<i>People tell me
that I have a nice voice.</i>

1687
02:09:04,903 --> 02:09:06,623
I think I'm leaning
towards this one.

1688
02:09:06,655 --> 02:09:09,825
<i>People often tell me
I have a sexy voice.</i>

1689
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:11,243
Which do you think?

1690
02:09:11,326 --> 02:09:14,121
None of them.
I like how you sound right now.

1691
02:09:16,081 --> 02:09:20,127
Okay, just pick one 'cause I'm
getting sick of the one I've got, hmm?

1692
02:09:22,212 --> 02:09:24,631
<i>We're one big family now.</i>

1693
02:09:25,132 --> 02:09:28,260
<i>Sometimes,
I go down to Earth to make trees.</i>

1694
02:09:28,343 --> 02:09:30,596
<i>Captain Jang doesn't drink anymore.</i>

1695
02:09:30,679 --> 02:09:33,056
<i>And Bubs is happy being herself.</i>

1696
02:09:33,932 --> 02:09:37,019
<i>She says she wants to be
a sophisticated lady.</i>

1697
02:09:37,102 --> 02:09:41,732
<i>Uncle Tiger got rid of his tattoos
so he wouldn't scare my friends.</i>

1698
02:09:41,815 --> 02:09:45,611
<i>And Uncle Tae-ho bought
ten pairs of new shoes.</i>

1699
02:09:46,236 --> 02:09:49,072
{\an8}<i>I think my dad is watching me
from somewhere.</i>

1700
02:09:49,156 --> 02:09:51,325
{\an8}<i>And when he's happy, I'm happy.</i>

1701
02:09:58,207 --> 02:10:01,293
Rude. Hey, I'm trying to read here!

1702
02:10:01,794 --> 02:10:04,004
What the heck are they doing
on our turf? Hey!

1703
02:10:04,087 --> 02:10:05,380
Start the engine.

1704
02:10:05,923 --> 02:10:07,633
Maybe they found something good out there.

1705
02:10:17,976 --> 02:10:21,230
Okay, let's make
some money today, shall we?

1706
02:16:20,046 --> 02:16:25,051
Darcy Paquet, Stefan Schwarz

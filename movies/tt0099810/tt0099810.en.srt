2
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,971
Cold this morning, Captain.

3
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,690
Cold.

4
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,996
And hard.

5
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:20,266
It's time, Captain...

6
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:26,105
It's time.

7
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,359
Time indeed.

8
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:51,089
You're supposed to be upstairs
sleeping.

9
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:56,928
- Stanley keeps waking me up.
- Oh, I get it...

10
00:04:57,804 --> 00:05:01,266
- You're getting heavy.
- No nonsense.

11
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:05,979
Two stories. Two glasses of water.
Jack...

12
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:12,653
- You're going to miss the plane.
- Go upstairs with Mrs Wheeler.

13
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,866
When I'm on my business trip,
I'll get Stanley a little brother.

14
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:20,244
- Promise?
- I promise.

15
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:58,283
- Can I get you anything, sir?
- No, thank you.

16
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:03,873
If you try and get some sleep,
the flight will go a lot faster.

17
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,126
I can never sleep on a plane.
Turbulence.

18
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:10,379
- Pardon?
- Turbulence.

19
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:14,884
Solar radiation heats the earth's crust,
warm air rises, cool air descends.

20
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:19,222
- I don't like that.
- Try to get some sleep anyway.

21
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:59,722
Dr Ryan?

22
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:19,242
Jack, get yourself in here.

23
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:21,995
Jesus, you look like hell.

24
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:26,124
Thank you very much, Admiral.
I could use some coffee.

25
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:30,045
I'm not going to ask you
how your flight went.

26
00:07:30,212 --> 00:07:35,217
- When did you last get some sleep?
- I don't know.

27
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:38,721
Milk and sugar.

28
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:41,640
How's Caroline?

29
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:45,853
Last time I saw her was
at your grandad's place in Maine.

30
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,148
She's fine. She sends you her best.

31
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:54,486
And Sally? What is she now, three?

32
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:58,658
No, she's a very precocious five.

33
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:04,080
She announced the other day
that she'd be less lonely,

34
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:08,126
if we were to buy her a baby brother.

35
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:14,216
But she decided it would be enough
if we were to buy one for Stanley.

36
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:19,346
- Who's Stanley?
- Stanley's a bear.

37
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:27,438
What's important enough to get you
on a plane in the middle of the night?

38
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:31,817
British Intelligence obtained
these pictures of theRed October.

39
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:36,030
- She's the latest Typhoon class.
- Big son of a bitch.

40
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:40,284
Twelve metres longer than standard,
three metres wider.

41
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:44,247
- Captain's name is Ramius.
- One of yours?

42
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:49,919
I did the bio on him last year.
He always takes out their lead boat.

43
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:55,259
Good political connections.
Trained their attack-boat skippers.

44
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:59,429
The Russians call him
Vilnius nastavnic.

45
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:01,974
The Vilnius schoolmaster.

46
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:08,230
- What are these doors?
- Those doors are the problem.

47
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:14,736
I don't know what they are, neither
do the British. Perhaps they're new.

48
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:19,575
I'd like to show these to Skip Tyler.

49
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:23,496
- The sub driver?
- He was until he lost his leg.

50
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:28,835
Now he teaches at the Academy.
He's got top-secret clearance.

51
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:35,508
Have a car for Dr Ryan
downstairs in ten minutes.

52
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:43,349
The satellite caughtRed October
in Polijarny Inlet this morning.

53
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,523
- Do you hear it?
- No.

54
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:35,320
At Cal Tech we used to do this
in our sleep. Do you hear it now?

55
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:38,573
Wait a minute... maybe.

56
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:43,161
- It's buried in surface clutter.
- Yes.

57
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:46,290
- I should go to SAPS?
- Correct, Seaman Beaumont.

58
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:50,503
Signal Algorithmic Processing Systems.

59
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,590
Give it a week
and you'll be teaching at Cal Tech.

60
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:59,804
So, like Beethoven on the computer,

61
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:02,974
you have laboured to produce...

62
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:10,231
...a biologic.

63
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:15,904
- Awhat?
- Awhale.

64
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:21,743
A marine mammal that knows
a lot more about sonar than you do.

65
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,416
Kill the SAPS. Go over to 269,
and let's try it again.

66
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:33,463
If he gets to bothering you,
ask him about Pavarotti.

67
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,886
I was in the middle of teaching
Beaumont about modern sonar.

68
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:45,435
- I'm chief of the boat.
- Tell me, COB.

69
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:48,897
OK, fine, go ahead.

70
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:54,569
Seaman Jones is into music
in a big way.

71
00:11:54,736 --> 00:12:00,742
He figures this whole boat
is his personal, private stereo set.

72
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:05,747
- He gets this piece of Pavarotti...
- It was Paganini.

73
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:08,082
This is my story.

74
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:11,754
Pavarotti is a tenor.
Paganini was a composer.

75
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:19,678
He's got this music,
and he's listening to it on his head set.

76
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:24,225
Then all hell breaks loose. There's
a slew of boats out of San Diego.

77
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:30,105
- And one way out at Pearl.
- All of a sudden they start hearing...

78
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:35,361
Pavarotti is coming out of their asses.
Jones here...

79
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:40,242
- What do I do?
- I got it.

80
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:47,791
New contact bearing 097.
Designate contact Sierra-35.

81
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,795
- What have you got, Jonesy?
- Probably submerged.

82
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:57,467
It's a wild guess, but I'd say it could
be a missile boat out of Polijarny.

83
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:04,432
Start your track.
I'll be there in a minute.

84
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:07,123
Time to open the orders, sir.

85
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,460
The Political Officer...

86
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:13,087
...is in your cabin.

87
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:15,048
Very well.

88
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:18,092
You have the con.

89
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:39,240
What are you doing?

90
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:44,703
I must oversee the stability
of the crew, Captain.

91
00:14:45,788 --> 00:14:49,208
By invading my privacy?

92
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,506
Privacy is not of major concern
in the Soviet Union, comrade.

93
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:59,134
It's often contrary to the collective good.

94
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:07,769
"Behold, I am coming as a thief...

95
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:12,065
"And they gathered them together

96
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:18,947
"in a place called Armageddon."

97
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:25,161
"The 7th angel poured forth his bowl,
and a voice cried out from Heaven,

98
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:28,164
"It is done."

99
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:34,463
A man with your responsibilities
reading about the end of the world.

100
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,887
What's this? "I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

101
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:45,182
It is an ancient Hindu text
quoted by an American.

102
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:48,519
- American?
- He invented the atomic bomb.

103
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:51,647
He was accused
of being a communist.

104
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:56,319
You wrote and underlined
these passages.

105
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:57,988
No.

106
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:04,745
This book belonged to my wife.
I keep it for sentimental value.

107
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:08,081
I'm sorry.
Your wife was a beautiful woman.

108
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:11,293
Her death was unfortunate.

109
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,672
I'm only doing my job.
It is my responsibility.

110
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:21,845
How many KGB agents
are aboard my boat?

111
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:27,936
Your boat? This vessel belongs
to the people of the Soviet Union.

112
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:32,523
Besides, if the KGB or the GRU
has agents aboard,

113
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,693
I would be the last to know.

114
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:40,532
I suggest we open our orders.

115
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,785
Certainly, comrade.

116
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:31,585
"From Commander Strategic Forces
Red Banner Northern Fleet."

117
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:37,132
We are to proceed north,
to grid square 5490

118
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:43,430
and rendezvous withKonovalov,
Captain Tupolev's boat.

119
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:49,394
- You know Tupolev?
- I know he was your student.

120
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,774
It's rumoured he has a place
in his heart for you.

121
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:58,946
There's little room in Tupolev's heart
for anyone but Tupolev.

122
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:08,206
We are to make contact and run tests.
Tupolev will hunt our ship.

123
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:11,042
We are to evaluate the readiness
of the caterpillar drive.

124
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:15,796
We return to Polijarny
on or about the 16th of this month.

125
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:21,094
This is an historic moment.

126
00:18:21,261 --> 00:18:24,973
- I should like to make a request.
- Before you proceed...

127
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,811
Would you permit me
to post the orders for the crew?

128
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:58,758
Where I am going, you cannot follow.

129
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:33,377
Dr Petrov, report to my cabin.
There's been a dreadful accident.

130
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,827
Hey, buddy!

131
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:21,427
There's no cradle underneath it.
Get it over.

132
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:27,516
You want to come up here
and do it yourself?

133
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:33,856
Ryan! Who let you in here?

134
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:37,860
Have they got you
playing with models now?

135
00:20:38,694 --> 00:20:42,241
Damn it, Phil! Tell them to slow down.

136
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,536
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

137
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,957
It's not a model.
It's a DSRV. A rescue sub.

138
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,377
I've never seen one before.
What are you doing with it?

139
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:59,132
We're rigging it with a generic
docking collar for other subs.

140
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,053
We can get it anywhere
in the world in 24 hours.

141
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:09,477
- How's your back?
- It's fine. Have you got a minute?

142
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:16,901
It's bigger than a regular Typhoon.
What are these doors?

143
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,529
You don't miss much.

144
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,699
Those are too big to be torpedo tubes.

145
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,452
Can you launch an ICBM horizontally?

146
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,038
Sure. Why would you want to?

147
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:34,043
They're symmetrical,
right down the long axis of the sub.

148
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:39,508
- How about a towed sonar array?
- Too close to the screws.

149
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,260
I'll be!

150
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:46,015
This could be a caterpillar.

151
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:51,228
- Awhat?
- Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

152
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,689
- You follow?
- No.

153
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:57,693
It's like a jet engine for the water.

154
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,404
It goes in the front and
gets squirted out the back.

155
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:04,033
It's got no moving parts,
so it's very, very quiet.

156
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:08,496
- How quiet?
- Sonar wouldn't pick it up.

157
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:15,212
It'd sound like whales or a seismic
anomaly, anything but a submarine.

158
00:22:16,254 --> 00:22:21,259
We messed with this a few years ago.
Couldn't make it work.

159
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:27,891
- They really built this?
- She put to sea this morning.

160
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:38,110
When I was 12, I helped my daddy
build a bomb shelter in our basement,

161
00:22:38,277 --> 00:22:44,408
because some fool parked a dozen
warheads off the coast of Florida.

162
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:48,829
This thing could park 200 warheads
off Washington or New York,

163
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:54,502
and no one would know anything
about it until it was all over.

164
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:07,933
- Are you all right, Captain?
- Yes.

165
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,854
It's just to die from something
as petty as slipping on tea...

166
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:17,484
It was an accident.
You'll feel better when we put in.

167
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:21,071
- Put in?
- Return to base.

168
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:23,448
We have no political officer.

169
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:28,954
This is a Soviet combat vessel
and I am a senior combat officer.

170
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:34,294
We do not cancel operations
because of accidents.

171
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,505
Seaman, come here.

172
00:23:38,631 --> 00:23:40,174
Come here.

173
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:45,638
- Your name?
- Cook's Assistant Loginov.

174
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:49,392
I want you and the doctor
to witness this.

175
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:56,357
I'm removing the Political Officer's
missile key and keeping it myself.

176
00:23:57,525 --> 00:24:00,362
We should report this
to Red Fleet Command.

177
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:06,327
That's impossible.
Our orders are for radio silence.

178
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:11,540
- That's all, Loginov.
- This is most unnerving.

179
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:19,381
The reason for having two missile
keys is so that no one man may...

180
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:24,678
- May what?
- May arm the missiles.

181
00:24:24,845 --> 00:24:28,850
- Perhaps I should keep the key.
- That'll be all, Doctor.

182
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:33,980
When I address the crew,
then you will understand.

183
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:35,815
Yes, sir.

184
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,779
- Petrov.
- Yes, sir?

185
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:45,742
I will try to forget your comments
when I present my report.

186
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:47,911
Thank you, sir.

187
00:24:52,582 --> 00:24:59,215
Holding steady on 310.
12 knots at about 20,000 yards.

188
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:04,554
- Have you got a make on it?
- The computer is chewing on it.

189
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,390
It sounds like a Typhoon.

190
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:18,234
We got a new boat, sir.

191
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:24,408
- Did I miss something on the boards?
- Subland hasn't said anything.

192
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:31,164
- How many Typhoons are listed?
- Six.

193
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:38,088
OK, call this guy Typhoon 7.
Work in a little closer.

194
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:45,762
- Won't he hear us?
- Not if we stay in his baffles.

195
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:49,933
Come in behind his propeller
and he's deaf as a post.

196
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:24,595
- Any sonar contacts?
- No, the sonar is clear.

197
00:26:24,762 --> 00:26:28,974
- Do we have any surface contacts?
- No, the scope is clear.

198
00:26:29,141 --> 00:26:33,979
Good. Then it's time I explain
our orders to the crew.

199
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:38,484
Comrades, this is your captain.

200
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:41,237
It is an honour to speak to you,

201
00:26:41,403 --> 00:26:46,867
while sailing in our motherland's
most recent achievement.

202
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:51,706
Once more,
we play our dangerous game.

203
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:58,004
A game of chess, against our old
adversary, the American Navy.

204
00:26:58,171 --> 00:27:05,178
For 40 years, your fathers before you
played this game well.

205
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:10,934
But today the game is different.
We have the advantage.

206
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:14,938
It reminds me of the heady days
of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin.

207
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:18,192
The world trembled at the sound
of our rockets.

208
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:22,321
It will tremble again
at the sound of our silence.

209
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:26,534
- The order is: Engage the silent drive.
- Aye, sir.

210
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:31,831
Ballast control, open outer doors.
Diving command.

211
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:34,250
Engage caterpillar
and secure main engines.

212
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:40,631
Doors opening.

213
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,137
Comrades, our own fleet
doesn't know our full potential.

214
00:27:45,304 --> 00:27:47,973
They will test us.

215
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:53,395
But they will embarrass themselves.
We'll leave our fleet behind.

216
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:57,774
We will pass through the American
patrols and their sonar nets.

217
00:27:57,941 --> 00:28:03,363
We'll lay off their largest city
and listen to their rock and roll,

218
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,575
while we conduct missile drills.

219
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:13,833
When we are finished, the only sound
they will hear is our laughter.

220
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,006
Then we will sail to Havana
for sunshine and comradeship.

221
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:28,348
- Cryogenic plant coming on line.
- Agreat day. We sail into history.

222
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:37,273
Caterpillar engaging.

223
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:42,112
Caterpillar engaging, Captain.

224
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:59,213
- What happened?
- I don't know.

225
00:29:25,991 --> 00:29:28,660
Full rudder left.

226
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:32,330
Navigator, new course: 250.

227
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:36,001
New course: 250.

228
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:12,915
Sonar contact. Port quarter.

229
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:17,210
- American, Los Angeles class.
- American!

230
00:30:17,377 --> 00:30:20,756
Course: 310.

231
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:28,555
- Is the American turning to follow us?
- No, he is continuing on his course.

232
00:30:28,722 --> 00:30:32,392
- He is continuing north-west.
- He can't hear us.

233
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,604
And the singing?

234
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,204
Let them sing.

235
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:14,061
- What? Check your gear.
- Running diagnostics, Captain.

236
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:23,946
The sonar is working.
The Russian disappeared.

237
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:28,534
One minute he was steady,
then he was gone.

238
00:31:29,618 --> 00:31:34,791
- And I thought I heard...
- Heard what?

239
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:37,294
I thought I heard singing, sir.

240
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:42,132
- Singing?
- Yes, sir.

241
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:14,165
Good morning, sir.
I hope we had a lovely evening.

242
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,001
A little chilly this morning.

243
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:43,362
There's a letter from Marko Ramius.

244
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:47,950
Marko!

245
00:33:19,315 --> 00:33:20,733
Yes?

246
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,695
No, this is Dr Ryan.

247
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:31,579
- What happened?
- This is no longer research.

248
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:42,089
I got a line on those doors.
You know what they are?

249
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:49,096
- A silent propulsion system.
- How did you know that?

250
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:55,061
The sub captain radioed in. The thing
disappeared right in front of him.

251
00:33:55,228 --> 00:33:58,440
That's only the half of it. Read.

252
00:34:08,408 --> 00:34:11,286
- Got your ID?
- This is unbelievable.

253
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:19,628
- They've sortied their whole fleet.
- Right.

254
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:29,138
- Where are we going?
- The President's Security Advisor.

255
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:34,018
Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there,
along with a few other people.

256
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:37,897
- Who's giving the briefing?
- You are.

257
00:34:38,064 --> 00:34:43,069
All the slides are laid out for you.
All you've got to do...

258
00:34:48,658 --> 00:34:53,997
Look, no one understands
this material better than you.

259
00:34:54,164 --> 00:34:58,085
Give him a run down on the sub
and the stuff in your hand.

260
00:34:58,252 --> 00:35:02,714
When he asks direct questions,
give him direct answers.

261
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:06,301
Tell him what you think. Come on.

262
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:19,357
The last 24 hours have seen some
extraordinary Soviet naval activity.

263
00:35:19,524 --> 00:35:23,319
The first ship to sail
was theRed October,

264
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:26,239
in reference to
the October revolution of 1917.

265
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,868
A variant of the Typhoon class,
she's 650 feet long

266
00:35:31,035 --> 00:35:33,871
and 32,000 tons
submerged displacement,

267
00:35:34,038 --> 00:35:38,126
roughly the same size
as a World War II aircraft carrier.

268
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:44,924
We believe that these doors enclose
a unique propulsion system.

269
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:48,554
A magneto-hydrodynamic drive,
or caterpillar,

270
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:52,558
that would enable the sub
to run virtually silent.

271
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:58,647
It is possible that this new drive
system allowed Captain Ramius...

272
00:35:58,814 --> 00:36:00,649
Do we have his picture?

273
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:07,656
...to elude our attack boatDallas,
which was trailingRed October.

274
00:36:09,742 --> 00:36:14,289
It is also possible
that this drive system, if operable,

275
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:19,294
could render theRed October
undetectable to our warning nets.

276
00:36:19,461 --> 00:36:24,132
Would you characterise this
as a first-strike weapon?

277
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,804
That is a possibility, sir.

278
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:37,103
It is designed to approach by stealth,
armed with nuclear warheads.

279
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,653
- Damn thing was made to start a war.
- Proceed, Mr Ryan.

280
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:47,615
After theDallaslost contact,
there were additional sailings.

281
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:53,329
From Polijarny, Leningrad
and from the Mediterranean.

282
00:36:53,496 --> 00:36:58,459
There are now some 58 nuclear subs
headed at high speed into the Atlantic.

283
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:02,213
This afternoon's satellite pass
over Polijarny found heat blooms,

284
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:12,724
This constitutes the bulk
of the Soviet surface fleet.

285
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:15,185
Admiral, your conclusions?

286
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:18,855
The data supports no conclusions as yet.

287
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:25,821
Absence of activity in the Pacific
suggests that this is just an exercise.

288
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:30,993
Suppose this is a move against NATO?

289
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:38,333
I have some very sensitive information.
It must not leave this room.

290
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,006
Before sailing, Ramius sent a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin,

291
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:46,676
chairman of the Red Fleet
Northern Directorate.

292
00:37:46,843 --> 00:37:51,347
That's her uncle, Ramius' wife.

293
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:54,017
Padorin is her uncle.

294
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:57,520
The contents of the letter are unknown.

295
00:37:57,687 --> 00:38:02,358
Padorin immediately demanded
a meeting with Premier Chernenko.

296
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:04,777
Within minutes of that meeting,

297
00:38:04,944 --> 00:38:09,950
orders were given to findRed October
and sink her.

298
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:16,540
- Sink her?
- They've got a madman on their hands.

299
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:21,837
Within 500 miles off the coast,
we'll have only two minutes' warning.

300
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:41,066
- Today's the 23rd, isn't it?
- Yeah.

301
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,079
You son of a bitch.

302
00:38:55,247 --> 00:38:58,083
You son of a bitch!

303
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:06,092
You wish to add something
to our discussion, Dr Ryan?

304
00:39:10,596 --> 00:39:15,601
Well, perhaps there's another
possibility we might consider.

305
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:19,313
Ramius might be trying to defect.

306
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,943
- Do you mean to suggest?
- Proceed, Mr Ryan.

307
00:39:27,113 --> 00:39:31,951
Well... Ramius trained most
of their officer corps.

308
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,540
He could select men willing to help him.

309
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,959
He's not Russian.

310
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:44,381
He's Lithuanian by birth,
raised by his grandfather.

311
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,552
He has no children.
No ties to leave behind.

312
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,683
And today is the first anniversary
of his wife's death.

313
00:39:54,850 --> 00:40:01,232
- Come on. You'rejust an analyst.
- I know Ramius.

314
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:06,237
He's nearly a legend in the submarine
community. He's a maverick.

315
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,740
I met him at an embassy dinner.

316
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,285
Have you ever met Captain Ramius,
General?

317
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:27,091
How long before Ramius could be
in a position to fire his missiles at us?

318
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:32,514
- Four days.
- All right, I'll brief the President.

319
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:38,520
Dr Ryan, would you stay
for a moment, please?

320
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:42,691
I said speak your mind, Jack, but Jesus!

321
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,707
You slammed the door on the general.

322
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:01,336
- That was not my intention, sir.
- Yes, it was.

323
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:06,174
He was patronising you.
In my opinion he deserved it.

324
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:12,389
Listen, I'm a politician,
which means I'm a cheat and a liar.

325
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:16,017
When I'm not kissing babies,
I'm stealing their lollipops.

326
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:21,231
But it also means
that I keep my options open.

327
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:27,363
Let's assume for a minute
that you're right,

328
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,533
and this Russian intends to defect.

329
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:35,121
What do you suggest we do about it?

330
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:39,917
- We definitely grab the boat.
- Wait a minute.

331
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:43,254
This is not a stray pilot with a MiG.

332
00:41:43,421 --> 00:41:48,217
We're talking about several billion
dollars worth of Soviet property.

333
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:53,472
- They're going to want it back.
- We could inspect it.

334
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,936
Call it a Coastguard safety inspection.

335
00:41:58,103 --> 00:42:00,606
How do we proceed?

336
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:05,068
We need to contact the commanders
in the Atlantic directly.

337
00:42:05,235 --> 00:42:09,948
If the Russians get one whiff of this,
the game is up.

338
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:13,118
We need to be able to help them.

339
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:17,956
We need to be ready to go
at a moment's notice.

340
00:42:18,123 --> 00:42:23,796
And somebody has to find out
what Ramius' intentions really are.

341
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:27,091
OK, when do you leave?

342
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:30,595
Wait a minute!

343
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:36,059
The general was right.
I am only an analyst.

344
00:42:36,225 --> 00:42:39,270
You're perfect.
I can't ask any of these characters.

345
00:42:39,437 --> 00:42:43,191
They wouldn't stake their reputations
on a hunch.

346
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:46,527
- Whereas you...
...are expendable.

347
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,283
Something like that.

348
00:42:54,203 --> 00:42:57,581
I'll give you three days.

349
00:42:57,748 --> 00:43:02,670
After that, I have to hunt down
Ramius and destroy him.

350
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:04,505
Will you do it?

351
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:22,857
Mother of God!

352
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:27,362
Secure the masts. All ahead two thirds.
Set depth to 900 metres.

353
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:33,368
- What is it? What's happened?
- Masts secured, ahead two thirds.

354
00:43:33,535 --> 00:43:37,789
- Come left, heading 205.
- 205, affirmative.

355
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:58,394
These orders are seven hours old!
Sitting on the bottom like a schoolboy!

356
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:01,731
- Captain?
- All ahead flank.

357
00:44:01,897 --> 00:44:07,403
Inquire of the engineer about going
to 105÷/o on the reactor.

358
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:12,241
Seven hours!
The entire fleet is after him.

359
00:44:21,293 --> 00:44:23,670
900 metres.

360
00:44:23,837 --> 00:44:29,927
105÷/o on the reactor is possible...
but not recommended.

361
00:44:41,313 --> 00:44:44,317
Go to 105 on the reactor.

362
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:52,909
- What is it? Where are we going?
- We're going to kill a friend.

363
00:44:53,743 --> 00:44:56,412
We're going to kill Ramius.

364
00:45:17,434 --> 00:45:21,730
If you likeborschtperhaps,
but I've eaten better in the galley.

365
00:45:21,897 --> 00:45:27,152
My wife asked the waiter
if the chef was from Afghanistan.

366
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:31,657
Then we went on to the ballet,
to see this new girl as Giselle.

367
00:45:31,824 --> 00:45:36,161
Remember how beautiful she was?
She just married a factory manager...

368
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:43,169
Doctor, do you have the figures for
the latest batch of radiation tests?

369
00:45:43,336 --> 00:45:44,796
Now?

370
00:45:45,797 --> 00:45:47,465
Now.

371
00:45:49,134 --> 00:45:54,347
Bring the preceding set as well,
for comparison.

372
00:45:55,515 --> 00:45:57,434
Thank you, Doctor.

373
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:17,538
It will take him some time.

374
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:24,503
Before we begin, I'd like to know
what happened to Putin.

375
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:36,390
- He didn't slip on his tea, did he?
- I don't think I like your tone.

376
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:43,732
- We're risking our lives here.
- Putin could have made complications.

377
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:47,861
Did you think he would go away
and sulk?

378
00:46:48,028 --> 00:46:54,368
- Are you saying he was murdered?
- Stop whining, Yuri.

379
00:46:54,534 --> 00:46:59,039
So he was murdered.
The man was a pig.

380
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:02,918
But it's a decision we should
have all made together.

381
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:08,591
If the crew finds out,
we could have a mutiny.

382
00:47:09,425 --> 00:47:14,639
Everything that happens on this ship
affects us all.

383
00:47:14,806 --> 00:47:18,685
- Why don't we go back?
- There'll be no going back.

384
00:47:21,604 --> 00:47:26,526
Before we sailed I dispatched
a letter to Admiral Padorin,

385
00:47:26,693 --> 00:47:30,989
in which I announced
our intention to defect.

386
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:36,412
In the name of God, why?

387
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:40,874
When he reached the new world,
Cortez burned his ships.

388
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:46,797
- Thus, his men were well motivated.
- You have signed our death warrants.

389
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:52,720
- Padorin will send the entire fleet.
- Jesus! They'll find us.

390
00:47:52,886 --> 00:47:57,182
Nobody is going to find us.
That's enough, Yuri.

391
00:47:57,349 --> 00:48:02,897
You couldn't just turn the sub
over to the Americans.

392
00:48:03,064 --> 00:48:06,860
You had to make a political statement.

393
00:48:07,027 --> 00:48:13,992
Or was it something deeper that
made you unable to simply slip away?

394
00:48:14,784 --> 00:48:20,665
- Was it ego, Captain?
- We each have our reasons, Victor.

395
00:48:20,832 --> 00:48:25,211
My own began the day I was handed
the blueprints for this ship.

396
00:48:25,378 --> 00:48:28,506
Aship which had but one use.

397
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:34,680
As for the rest, those are things
that I alone must carry the burden for.

398
00:48:36,057 --> 00:48:41,812
Anatoly, you're afraid of our fleet.
You should be.

399
00:48:41,979 --> 00:48:46,317
Personally, I give us...
one chance in three.

400
00:48:50,321 --> 00:48:52,031
More tea, anyone?

401
00:48:55,534 --> 00:48:57,203
No?

402
00:48:58,413 --> 00:49:01,959
Then you may report back to your posts.

403
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:21,103
You heard the captain, dismissed.

404
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:31,739
Captain.

405
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:49,257
I would never disagree with you
in front of the men.

406
00:49:49,424 --> 00:49:53,094
But in this case Victor is right.

407
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:58,517
It would have been better
if you had not informed Moscow.

408
00:49:58,684 --> 00:50:04,023
Moscow is not the worry,
nor the whole Soviet Navy.

409
00:50:04,189 --> 00:50:08,819
I know their tactics.
I have the advantage.

410
00:50:12,615 --> 00:50:15,200
The worry is the Americans.

411
00:50:16,452 --> 00:50:21,790
If we meet the right sort, this will work.

412
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:27,589
If we get some buckaroo...

413
00:50:32,552 --> 00:50:37,432
Some turbulence. You don't like flying?

414
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,061
This is nothing. You should have
been here five months ago.

415
00:50:41,227 --> 00:50:46,483
Talk about puke! We ran into
a hail storm over the Sea of Japan.

416
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:51,405
The pilot shot his lunch
all over the windshield.

417
00:50:51,572 --> 00:50:55,409
I barfed on the radio.
Knocked it out completely.

418
00:50:55,576 --> 00:51:00,206
It wasn't that lightweight stuff either
but industrial waste puke.

419
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:02,500
You want a bite?

420
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:07,672
Next time you get a bright idea,
just put it in a memo.

421
00:51:16,681 --> 00:51:20,852
- Sir.
- That will be all, Lieutenant.

422
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:26,733
- Did that Hawkeye trap?
- Number four wire.

423
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:32,030
- Not bad, considering.
- The gentleman is here to see you.

424
00:51:32,197 --> 00:51:36,743
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I apologise for the uniform.

425
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:40,163
It's Admiral Greer's idea of a low profile.

426
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:46,128
If you're working for Jim Greer,
you can tell me what this is all about.

427
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:53,886
Captain, have you got a minute?
Here's something you ought to see.

428
00:51:54,971 --> 00:52:00,393
Get yourself a cup of coffee.
I'll have some tea.

429
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,187
Get the captain a cup of tea.

430
00:52:08,234 --> 00:52:13,031
The moment that sub went silent
and I thought I heard singing...

431
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:19,955
I heard something in the background,
too, and I managed to get it on tape.

432
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:24,543
I washed it through the computer
and managed to isolate this sound.

433
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:33,385
The computer identified it
as magma displacement.

434
00:52:33,552 --> 00:52:38,307
The SAPS software was originally
written to look for seismic events.

435
00:52:38,474 --> 00:52:42,227
When it gets confused,
it runs home to momma.

436
00:52:42,394 --> 00:52:45,607
- I'm not following you.
- I'm sorry.

437
00:52:45,774 --> 00:52:49,277
Listen to it at ten times speed.

438
00:52:56,618 --> 00:52:59,454
That's got to be man-made.

439
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:07,003
The first contact was at 09.15,
and the bearing was 269.

440
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:12,969
At 09.30, it was here.
At 11 and 11.15, it was here and here.

441
00:53:13,135 --> 00:53:18,432
Russian subs have been reported
running Reykjanes Ridge at high speed.

442
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:21,894
- They had hyper-accurate maps.
- Yeah, Red Route One.

443
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:26,899
The front door to those canyons
was a formation called Thor's Twins.

444
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:28,567
Look...

445
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:47,504
Right into Red Route One.

446
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:55,053
You may think I'm crazy, but I'll bet
we found some new Russian sub.

447
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,515
And it's headed for the Iceland coast.

448
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:05,856
A $40 million computer tells you
you're chasing an earthquake,

449
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:11,362
but you don't believe it, and
you come up with this on your own.

450
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:16,743
- Yes, sir.
- Relax, you've sold me.

451
00:54:18,369 --> 00:54:25,710
Plot us a course for the bottom end
of Red Route One.

452
00:54:25,877 --> 00:54:31,424
We'll never find him in those canyons.
But first we'd better phone in.

453
00:54:31,591 --> 00:54:33,593
Aye, aye, Captain.

454
00:54:42,227 --> 00:54:44,396
Hang on, Jonesy.

455
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:53,113
If I can get you close enough,
can you track this sucker?

456
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:59,578
Yes, sir. Now that I know
what to listen for... I'll bag him.

457
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:04,416
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

458
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:08,713
That's the craziest notion
I've ever heard!

459
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,924
An entire ballistic
missile submarine?

460
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:15,345
They can't all want to defect,
even if it's only the officers.

461
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:19,266
- What's his plan?
- His plan?

462
00:55:19,432 --> 00:55:22,560
Russians don't take a dump
without a plan.

463
00:55:22,727 --> 00:55:27,941
Senior captains are sure to have
thought the matter through.

464
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:32,153
- He's just going to sail into New York?
- It might be that simple.

465
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,366
Things might be simple at CIA,

466
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:40,579
but in the middle of the North Atlantic
they get a bit more complex.

467
00:55:40,746 --> 00:55:44,667
- Smoke?
- No, thank you.

468
00:55:44,834 --> 00:55:48,838
And you'd need more
than a few days' inspection.

469
00:55:49,005 --> 00:55:53,801
In order to be any value,
you'd have to tear it apart.

470
00:55:53,968 --> 00:55:59,140
- Then we'd have to keep it.
- What will you do with the crew?

471
00:55:59,307 --> 00:56:03,145
They'd know we got the boat.

472
00:56:03,312 --> 00:56:09,359
- Or do you plan to eliminate them?
- We're not at war, sir.

473
00:56:09,526 --> 00:56:14,990
So we have to do this in such a way
that they think we don't have the boat.

474
00:56:15,157 --> 00:56:18,910
They'll go back and report
that we don't have it.

475
00:56:19,077 --> 00:56:24,333
Otherwise this whole business
is just academic, right?

476
00:56:24,499 --> 00:56:27,002
Yes, I see your point.

477
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:34,510
- When was the last time you slept?
- Awhile.

478
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:40,183
- The chief outside will fix you up.
- Thank you, sir.

479
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,352
Captain.

480
00:56:46,522 --> 00:56:50,193
It'll be dawn soon. We'll be in the CIC.

481
00:56:50,818 --> 00:56:55,573
Things are liable to get
a little dicey around here.

482
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:07,711
- You think he's crazy?
- Certifiable.

483
00:57:07,878 --> 00:57:12,049
And I don't care for him
wearing the uniform.

484
00:57:12,216 --> 00:57:17,513
Did you see that ring on his finger?
The Academy, class of '72. A Marine.

485
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,058
- You're kidding!
- Greer told me.

486
00:57:21,225 --> 00:57:27,899
In the summer of his third year,
he went down in a chopper accident.

487
00:57:28,066 --> 00:57:33,405
He spent ten months in traction
and another year learning to walk.

488
00:57:33,571 --> 00:57:37,367
He did his fourth year from the hospital.

489
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:42,914
It's up to you, Charlie, but you might
consider cutting the kid a little slack.

490
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:49,796
The Russians will find that sub
before we get near it anyway.

491
00:58:10,651 --> 00:58:15,072
- Passing Thor's Twins, sir.
- Very good.

492
00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:23,414
- Passing the Twins now, Captain.
- Commence your run.

493
00:58:23,581 --> 00:58:26,918
Call me when you get to the first
turning.

494
00:58:27,085 --> 00:58:31,381
Mr Kamarov, commence your run.

495
00:58:32,132 --> 00:58:37,721
First leg on my mark.
Course: 260. Speed: 18 knots.

496
00:58:37,888 --> 00:58:40,557
Depth: 270 metres.

497
00:58:40,724 --> 00:58:46,563
Five, four, three, two, one...

498
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,398
...mark.

499
00:58:48,565 --> 00:58:54,739
Diving Command, course: 260.
Speed: 18 knots.

500
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:58,493
Stop pissing, Yuri.
Give me a stopwatch and map,

501
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:02,372
and I'll fly the Alps in a plane
with no windows.

502
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:05,208
If the map is accurate enough.

503
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:29,024
We're in the lane and
approaching the first turn.

504
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:34,363
Come left to course 195 in 30 seconds.

505
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:40,202
Decrease depth to 200 metres.
Maintain speed.

506
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:45,541
Captain, we are approaching
the first turn.

507
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:49,546
Increase speed to 26 knots
and recompute.

508
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:54,551
Aye, Captain.

509
00:59:56,052 --> 00:59:58,888
Navigator, recompute for 26 knots.

510
01:00:00,432 --> 01:00:05,478
Turn on my mark. Five, four, three,

511
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:08,398
two, one, mark.

512
01:00:08,565 --> 01:00:13,445
Diving control, come left to 195.
Up on the bow planes.

513
01:00:21,954 --> 01:00:26,751
Course now 195 and
maintaining speed 26 knots.

514
01:00:31,088 --> 01:00:35,092
- Mr Kamarov?
- Next leg, Captain.

515
01:00:35,259 --> 01:00:40,681
Come right to course 240
now at 8 minutes and 40 seconds.

516
01:00:40,848 --> 01:00:44,018
Very good. Maintain course and speed.

517
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:51,610
Too fast, Vassily.

518
01:00:51,777 --> 01:00:56,949
Those charts are laid out precisely.
So many knots for so many seconds.

519
01:00:57,115 --> 01:01:02,496
- This thing handles like a pig.
- Watch your bearing, Mr Slavin.

520
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,130
15 seconds to turn.
Should we decrease speed?

521
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:15,134
Negative. Prepare to come right.

522
01:01:16,594 --> 01:01:21,391
Eight, seven, six, five, four,

523
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:25,144
three, two, one, mark.

524
01:01:25,311 --> 01:01:31,234
15 degrees on the bow planes.
Come right. 240. Move it!

525
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:55,592
We're in the lane. Next leg, 34 minutes
to the Neptune Massif.

526
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:58,595
Course: 240.

527
01:02:11,067 --> 01:02:14,738
- What happened?
- The cryogenic plant.

528
01:02:14,904 --> 01:02:19,993
The magnets aren't being cooled.
We're 50 degrees above red line.

529
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,956
- It's going to melt.
- Kill it, shut it down!

530
01:02:28,835 --> 01:02:35,383
- The cryogenic plant failed.
- Reactor damage?

531
01:02:35,884 --> 01:02:39,930
- The reactor scrammed automatically.
- Was there any core damage?

532
01:02:40,097 --> 01:02:43,517
- Any radiation leakage?
- I don't know yet.

533
01:02:43,684 --> 01:02:50,024
- How long will it take to fix?
- I've got to find out what's wrong first.

534
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:55,404
We will have to stop
and repair the caterpillar unit.

535
01:02:55,571 --> 01:03:02,119
- We will run on normal propulsion.
- Captain, we will not be silent.

536
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:07,459
Make revolutions for 20 knots
and engage the propellers.

537
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:16,593
- Aye, Captain.
- That man will get us all killed.

538
01:03:21,223 --> 01:03:25,769
The captain knows what he's doing.
Doctor...

539
01:03:27,771 --> 01:03:32,067
Naval activities?
I have no knowledge of this.

540
01:03:32,234 --> 01:03:36,531
- But then I never was a sailor.
- Mr Ambassador...

541
01:03:36,698 --> 01:03:41,035
You have nearly 100 naval vessels
operating in the North Atlantic.

542
01:03:41,202 --> 01:03:43,538
You've dropped enough sonar buoys

543
01:03:43,705 --> 01:03:50,378
for a man to walk from Greenland to
Scotland without getting his feet wet.

544
01:03:51,587 --> 01:03:56,342
You make your point
as delicately as ever, but...

545
01:03:56,509 --> 01:04:00,513
What looks like an exercise
could be a prelude to war.

546
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:05,936
How can we tell the difference?
We have to deploy our ships.

547
01:04:06,103 --> 01:04:08,355
Has your government considered

548
01:04:08,522 --> 01:04:15,112
that having your ships and ours, your
aircraft and ours in such proximity

549
01:04:15,279 --> 01:04:18,032
is inherently dangerous?

550
01:04:18,198 --> 01:04:21,327
Wars have begun that way.

551
01:04:30,836 --> 01:04:34,007
- We have lost one of our submarines.
- Lost it?

552
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:38,553
We fear she may be down.
This is most embarrassing.

553
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:45,477
Several of the crew, the officers,
are sons of high Party officials.

554
01:04:46,311 --> 01:04:51,441
One is even the son
of a Central Committee member.

555
01:04:52,484 --> 01:04:57,697
- This is a massive rescue operation?
- That is correct.

556
01:05:00,785 --> 01:05:04,455
I'm terribly sorry. How can we help?

557
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:11,295
- I'm not sure that...
- Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

558
01:05:14,632 --> 01:05:17,385
That is very gracious of you.

559
01:05:17,551 --> 01:05:20,680
I will pass your offer on.

560
01:05:20,846 --> 01:05:24,225
But I think we're doing everything
that can be done.

561
01:05:43,578 --> 01:05:44,913
Captain.

562
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,837
Our strategy depends on your answer.

563
01:05:52,004 --> 01:05:55,549
- The fleet will know where we are.
- Captain, sonar!

564
01:05:55,716 --> 01:05:59,262
We have just been overflown
by a low-altitude, multi-engined plane.

565
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:01,431
Put it on audio.

566
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,188
Short transients close aboard.
Water entry of small objects.

567
01:06:10,106 --> 01:06:13,610
- Sonar buoys.
- Battle stations.

568
01:06:13,776 --> 01:06:17,614
Battle stations!

569
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:20,450
How long to Neptune Massif?

570
01:06:21,576 --> 01:06:26,248
- How long?
- 4 minutes, 10 seconds.

571
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:30,127
- Should we bottom the boat?
- It's too late for that now.

572
01:06:30,294 --> 01:06:36,383
We're out of time. Counter measures.
Prepare to launch a full spread.

573
01:06:44,892 --> 01:06:48,062
Request permission to launch.

574
01:06:48,812 --> 01:06:51,148
Launch the weapon.

575
01:06:53,067 --> 01:06:54,736
Weapon is away.

576
01:06:59,574 --> 01:07:03,912
High-speed screw.
Torpedo in the water.

577
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:06,748
Torpedo is active.

578
01:07:09,376 --> 01:07:15,006
- Torpedo has acquired.
- Launch counter measures.

579
01:07:22,848 --> 01:07:26,060
- How long to the turn?
- 2 minutes, 9 seconds.

580
01:07:26,227 --> 01:07:29,772
We've no room to manoeuvre.
If the counter measure...

581
01:07:29,939 --> 01:07:32,358
Shut up!

582
01:07:36,279 --> 01:07:40,741
Torpedo has reached counter measures
and lost contact.

583
01:07:40,908 --> 01:07:42,368
Massif approaching.

584
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:51,628
Torpedo has reacquired
and is homing.

585
01:07:51,795 --> 01:07:56,675
- Give me the count.
- Turn at Massif in 30 seconds.

586
01:07:56,842 --> 01:08:00,345
- Time to torpedo impact?
- 35 seconds.

587
01:08:00,512 --> 01:08:04,308
- Increase to flank.
- Full-ahead flank.

588
01:08:05,809 --> 01:08:11,356
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.
35 seconds.

589
01:08:18,823 --> 01:08:20,325
30 seconds.

590
01:08:21,784 --> 01:08:25,997
Turn at Massif in seven, six...

591
01:08:26,706 --> 01:08:29,167
...five, four...

592
01:08:29,334 --> 01:08:33,379
...three, two, one, mark.

593
01:08:33,546 --> 01:08:35,673
Torpedo impact: 25 seconds.

594
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,842
- The turn, Captain.
- Not yet.

595
01:08:40,928 --> 01:08:45,433
Mark plus eight seconds, nine, ten...

596
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:52,399
...11 seconds, 12, 13, 14,
plus 15 seconds.

597
01:08:52,566 --> 01:08:58,197
- Captain, we're out of position.
- Torpedo impact in 15 seconds.

598
01:08:58,822 --> 01:09:01,575
Sound collision.

599
01:09:01,742 --> 01:09:04,787
- We're out of the lane.
- You're relieved.

600
01:09:12,127 --> 01:09:17,133
Right full rudder!
Reverse starboard engine!

601
01:09:21,388 --> 01:09:24,391
Torpedo impact: 12 seconds.

602
01:09:24,557 --> 01:09:31,231
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

603
01:09:34,275 --> 01:09:39,990
Navigator, 16 degrees off the bow plane.

604
01:10:01,846 --> 01:10:07,435
- They're really shooting at us! Why?
- Easy, boy.

605
01:10:08,311 --> 01:10:14,609
If they were really shooting at us,
we'd be dead by now.

606
01:10:32,419 --> 01:10:36,548
I found out what happened
to the caterpillar.

607
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:43,306
The buffer circuit has been torn out.
It was only a matter of time.

608
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:50,146
- What are you saying?
- Somebody wanted to cripple the ship.

609
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:53,900
We have a saboteur on board.

610
01:10:58,029 --> 01:11:05,036
It can't be any of the officers,
it must be a member of the crew.

611
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:10,918
Go and check Putin's files
for information on the crew.

612
01:11:11,085 --> 01:11:13,587
We may have to put them off
before we planned.

613
01:11:16,048 --> 01:11:21,053
"The average Russkie
don't take a dump without a plan."

614
01:11:22,513 --> 01:11:25,265
Wait a minute.

615
01:11:26,183 --> 01:11:30,646
He will already have figured out
how to get the crew off the ship.

616
01:11:30,813 --> 01:11:34,817
We just have to figure out
what he's gonna do.

617
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:38,530
How's he going to do it?

618
01:11:39,823 --> 01:11:42,951
They'd have to want to get off.

619
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:48,999
How do you get a crew
to want to get off a submarine?

620
01:11:49,165 --> 01:11:53,336
How do you get a crew
to want to get off a nuclear?

621
01:11:53,503 --> 01:11:56,548
- I know how he'll get the crew off.
- Not now.

622
01:12:01,636 --> 01:12:05,224
Yankee One declaring an emergency.

623
01:12:05,391 --> 01:12:09,103
Yankee One, vector 270.
Speed is buster, over.

624
01:12:10,813 --> 01:12:12,898
Say again, Yankee One.

625
01:12:13,065 --> 01:12:18,654
A Bear Foxtrot got too close to the group.
He bumped one of our F-14s.

626
01:12:18,821 --> 01:12:24,285
The plane's damaged.
They're trying to get him back aboard.

627
01:12:24,452 --> 01:12:27,204
Busy morning.

628
01:12:27,705 --> 01:12:32,668
Russian attack subs have taken up
station off every East Coast port.

629
01:12:32,835 --> 01:12:35,339
We're up here.

630
01:12:35,505 --> 01:12:37,758
TheNew Jerseyand her group
are moving up the coast.

631
01:12:37,924 --> 01:12:44,514
The Russians have attack subs
and surface groups here.

632
01:12:44,681 --> 01:12:48,352
- That's a lot of firepower.
- Yes.

633
01:12:48,518 --> 01:12:55,400
And there's something else strange.
They're not listening to their sonar.

634
01:12:55,567 --> 01:13:00,739
At 30 knots, they could run over
my daughter's stereo and not hear it.

635
01:13:02,283 --> 01:13:07,622
They're not trying to find Ramius,
they're trying to drive him.

636
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,919
Hounds to the hunters.

637
01:13:13,086 --> 01:13:17,507
Your sub captain is going
to make it to America.

638
01:13:17,674 --> 01:13:20,301
He's going to die within sight of it.

639
01:13:20,468 --> 01:13:23,680
His wingman requested
permission to fire.

640
01:13:23,846 --> 01:13:29,435
This could be the biggest naval battle
since Jutland. Jesus!

641
01:13:31,105 --> 01:13:35,567
- The water's too cold to eject.
- Try and bring him aboard.

642
01:13:35,734 --> 01:13:40,239
- What's this sub off by herself?
- Bart Mancuso's boat.

643
01:13:40,406 --> 01:13:43,659
He's at the bottom of Red Route One.

644
01:13:43,826 --> 01:13:48,205
He's contacted what his computer
calls magma displacement.

645
01:13:48,372 --> 01:13:52,626
Magma displacement?
Is that like a seismic anomaly?

646
01:13:52,793 --> 01:13:58,466
- I suppose so. Why?
- Can you get me on board theDallas?

647
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:05,890
- Mancuso found theRed October.
- He hasn't found anything.

648
01:14:06,057 --> 01:14:09,436
This silent propulsion system
could be mistaken for...

649
01:14:09,602 --> 01:14:13,106
The only way to get you out there
is by chopper.

650
01:14:13,273 --> 01:14:19,362
We'd have to strip it down
into a flying gas can.

651
01:14:19,529 --> 01:14:22,907
Yankee One is on final.
Rescue personnel are in place.

652
01:14:23,074 --> 01:14:25,368
Pick up your left wing.

653
01:14:25,535 --> 01:14:28,789
Power! Wave off!

654
01:14:29,373 --> 01:14:30,958
Eject!

655
01:14:45,222 --> 01:14:50,978
This business will get out of control
and we'll be lucky to live through it.

656
01:15:03,617 --> 01:15:07,663
There's enough fuel to get you there,
butDallasmay not be there.

657
01:15:07,829 --> 01:15:13,669
She might have gone deep.
If you have to ditch...

658
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:25,223
If you have to ditch,
get into the survival gear.

659
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:29,227
At this water temperature,
you'll have about four minutes.

660
01:15:29,394 --> 01:15:32,063
I'll try to remember that.

661
01:15:33,773 --> 01:15:37,443
Next time, Jack,
write a goddamn memo.

662
01:16:10,769 --> 01:16:14,189
- Is the captain sacked out?
- Yeah.

663
01:16:15,649 --> 01:16:19,404
- What about him?
- He won't leave.

664
01:16:28,788 --> 01:16:33,084
You know, I seen me a mermaid once.

665
01:16:33,626 --> 01:16:37,005
I even seen me a shark eat an octopus.

666
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:40,592
But I ain't never seen
no phantom Russian submarine.

667
01:17:20,175 --> 01:17:26,848
We're emerging from the route.
We'll make the first turn shortly.

668
01:17:28,058 --> 01:17:33,397
The caterpillar is operational
and appears to be running normally.

669
01:17:34,272 --> 01:17:39,486
The crew know about the saboteur
and they are afraid.

670
01:17:41,405 --> 01:17:45,326
That could be useful
when the time comes.

671
01:17:47,662 --> 01:17:52,917
We could make the Labrador coast
in 16 hours.

672
01:17:53,084 --> 01:17:56,337
Half of them would freeze
before they were rescued.

673
01:17:56,504 --> 01:18:01,092
It's Massachusetts or Maine in 48 hours.

674
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,845
Two days.

675
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:16,025
Do you think they will let me
live in Montana?

676
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:26,577
I would think they'll let you live
wherever you want.

677
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:32,082
Good, then I will live in Montana.

678
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:37,046
I will marry a round American woman
and raise rabbits.

679
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:40,716
And she will cook them for me.

680
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:43,553
And I will have a pickup truck,

681
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:51,102
or possibly even a recreational vehicle,

682
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:55,273
and drive from state to state.

683
01:18:56,483 --> 01:18:59,569
- Do they let you do that?
- Yes.

684
01:18:59,736 --> 01:19:04,449
- No papers?
- No papers. State to state.

685
01:19:04,616 --> 01:19:07,285
Commence your turn.

686
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:16,212
In winter, I will live in Arizona.

687
01:19:17,922 --> 01:19:22,802
- I think I will need two wives.
- At least.

688
01:19:32,436 --> 01:19:39,152
- Possible aspect change on target.
- Concur, change in bearing rate.

689
01:19:42,948 --> 01:19:46,994
- Crazy Ivan!
- All stop. Quiet.

690
01:19:54,459 --> 01:19:56,128
What's going on?

691
01:19:56,837 --> 01:20:00,924
Russian subs sometimes turn
to see if anyone is behind them.

692
01:20:01,091 --> 01:20:03,844
We call it Crazy Ivan.

693
01:20:04,803 --> 01:20:10,143
You shut everything down
and make like a hole in the water.

694
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:16,983
- What's the catch?
- A boat this big doesn't stop on a dime.

695
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:22,155
If we're too close, we'll drift right
into the back of them.

696
01:20:24,782 --> 01:20:28,161
What about you?
What do you look forward to?

697
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:42,968
I have no such appetites.

698
01:20:44,053 --> 01:20:47,014
Let's see if he can hear us.

699
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:54,104
There must be something.

700
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:04,074
What is it?

701
01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:11,998
I miss the peace of fishing.

702
01:21:12,165 --> 01:21:15,168
Like when I was a boy.

703
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:24,052
40 years I've been at sea.
A war at sea.

704
01:21:25,929 --> 01:21:29,057
A war with no battles.

705
01:21:30,392 --> 01:21:33,062
No monuments.

706
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:36,649
Only casualties.

707
01:21:40,027 --> 01:21:43,364
I widowed her the day I married her.

708
01:21:47,118 --> 01:21:50,579
My wife died while I was at sea.

709
01:22:09,266 --> 01:22:12,102
Post guards in the engineering spaces.

710
01:22:12,269 --> 01:22:17,357
If he can get to the caterpillar,
he can get to somewhere more vital.

711
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:25,824
- Where is he, Jonesy?
- Target is leaving our starboard baffles.

712
01:22:25,991 --> 01:22:30,496
My read is that
he's returning to base course.

713
01:22:30,663 --> 01:22:36,836
- Concur, he's returning to 210.
- He went right around us.

714
01:22:37,003 --> 01:22:41,883
Give him another 30 seconds.
Then secure from silent running.

715
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:46,054
Here's what we got on the ELF.

716
01:22:48,181 --> 01:22:50,058
Thanks.

717
01:22:57,983 --> 01:23:00,653
What is it?

718
01:23:01,862 --> 01:23:05,157
You're not going to believe this.

719
01:23:17,336 --> 01:23:21,465
We're approaching no return. Dallas
apparently didn't get the message.

720
01:23:21,632 --> 01:23:25,095
- We have to turn back.
- Give it a couple more minutes.

721
01:23:25,261 --> 01:23:27,764
Fuel status says we turn around now.

722
01:23:27,931 --> 01:23:30,725
Fuel status?
You've got a reserve fuel tank.

723
01:23:30,892 --> 01:23:35,021
I've got a ten minute reserve. I can't
invade that except in time of war.

724
01:23:35,188 --> 01:23:39,609
If you don't get me on that sub,
that's what you'll have.

725
01:23:39,776 --> 01:23:44,239
If you've got ten minutes of fuel,
we stay here ten minutes.

726
01:23:47,701 --> 01:23:53,207
I've got a submarine at three o'clock.
About two miles.

727
01:23:55,668 --> 01:24:00,256
- OK, hook him up.
- I'll be lowering you down to the sub.

728
01:24:00,423 --> 01:24:05,219
Give me an eight-minute clock.
Let's hope this thing runs on fumes.

729
01:24:05,386 --> 01:24:11,225
Surface the ship.
This guy is in for one hell of a ride.

730
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:14,895
OK, Commander, sit down.

731
01:24:15,563 --> 01:24:20,276
- Did you ever do this before?
- Once, on a calm day.

732
01:24:20,443 --> 01:24:23,739
The pilot will have trouble
keeping it steady.

733
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:26,908
Don't get grounded, keep the rod in
front.

734
01:24:27,075 --> 01:24:31,955
The rotors will be putting out
enough static to light up Chicago.

735
01:24:32,122 --> 01:24:36,376
I've got a diver ready
in case this guy goes in the drink.

736
01:24:36,543 --> 01:24:40,505
Who would go for a stunt like this?

737
01:25:04,947 --> 01:25:08,826
If I've got to bring you back up,
I'll shake the wire.

738
01:25:08,993 --> 01:25:13,998
I'll give you a thumbs up.
Remember to cross your arms.

739
01:25:14,165 --> 01:25:17,169
OK, out you go.

740
01:25:24,259 --> 01:25:28,138
He's halfway down.
You're drifting forward.

741
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:35,562
Get the hook on his cable.

742
01:25:35,729 --> 01:25:39,858
Watch it! Don't touch him.
OK, here he comes.

743
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:51,204
It'd be easier without that crosswind.
I can't see him.

744
01:25:53,498 --> 01:25:56,543
Don't touch him!

745
01:26:01,047 --> 01:26:05,677
- This is never going to work.
- Reel him back in.

746
01:26:12,434 --> 01:26:15,021
What's going on?

747
01:26:19,442 --> 01:26:21,402
Dallas, have you got a swimmer?

748
01:26:21,569 --> 01:26:26,198
Man overboard, port side.
Send out the diver.

749
01:26:26,365 --> 01:26:29,535
Dallas, we are history.

750
01:26:37,877 --> 01:26:42,049
Get the doc down here.
I'll be in the escape trunk.

751
01:26:45,177 --> 01:26:49,348
Down ladder. Make a hole.

752
01:27:04,988 --> 01:27:09,868
How do you do, Captain?
It's a pleasure to be aboard.

753
01:27:11,746 --> 01:27:14,749
I have to talk to the President.

754
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:19,170
Of course.
May I enquire as to the subject?

755
01:27:20,922 --> 01:27:27,595
My report of a missing submarine
was not completely accurate.

756
01:27:29,597 --> 01:27:34,936
The submarine in question
is commanded by Marko Ramius.

757
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:40,526
Apparently he has suffered
a mental or nervous breakdown.

758
01:27:42,069 --> 01:27:48,242
Just before he sailed, he posted
a letter to Admiral Padorin,

759
01:27:48,409 --> 01:27:51,120
in which he announced his intention...

760
01:27:53,622 --> 01:27:56,625
...to fire his missiles on the USA.

761
01:27:58,293 --> 01:28:01,046
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

762
01:28:01,213 --> 01:28:05,801
Moscow does not always
tell me everything.

763
01:28:05,968 --> 01:28:10,682
So one of your submarine captains
has gone insane?

764
01:28:10,849 --> 01:28:17,689
- You offered your assistance.
- You want us to help you kill him?

765
01:28:19,149 --> 01:28:24,195
I have been instructed to ask
your president for precisely that.

766
01:28:24,362 --> 01:28:29,576
We'd already found him.
We had to break off to pick you up.

767
01:28:29,743 --> 01:28:33,913
- Coffee. A cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

768
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:38,919
Assuming we can find him,
what am I supposed to do about it?

769
01:28:39,086 --> 01:28:43,257
We're receiving flash traffic
on the emergency circuit

770
01:28:43,424 --> 01:28:45,885
Bring it down.

771
01:28:47,511 --> 01:28:50,181
Well, Mr Ryan?

772
01:28:52,183 --> 01:28:56,479
- Chief, excuse us for a second.
- Come on, Leonard.

773
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:05,864
The sub is named theRed October,

774
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:08,367
under the command of Ramius.

775
01:29:08,533 --> 01:29:14,539
There's the possibility that he and
some of the crew want to defect.

776
01:29:16,708 --> 01:29:18,710
Defect?

777
01:29:19,711 --> 01:29:21,713
Excuse me.

778
01:29:38,481 --> 01:29:43,569
The boat's theRed October?
The skipper's Ramius?

779
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:49,200
It seems that circumstances
have changed somewhat.

780
01:29:56,165 --> 01:30:00,295
Get this man some dry clothes.
I'll be in the con.

781
01:30:01,171 --> 01:30:05,217
"Soviet submarineRed October
under the command of Marko Ramius

782
01:30:05,384 --> 01:30:10,139
"reported as potential renegade and
threatens independent missile launch.

783
01:30:10,305 --> 01:30:16,687
"Use any necessary force to prevent
its approach to the United States."

784
01:30:31,036 --> 01:30:35,957
Left 10 degrees rudder.
Steer course 265.

785
01:30:39,711 --> 01:30:42,547
Chief of the Watch, rig for red.

786
01:30:52,891 --> 01:30:57,855
- What's going on?
- Battle stations manned and ready.

787
01:30:58,022 --> 01:31:04,320
- Captain, I have to talk to you.
- Not now. Take her to 1,200 feet.

788
01:31:04,487 --> 01:31:10,159
Diving officer,
make your depth 1,200 feet.

789
01:31:10,326 --> 01:31:15,915
Full dive on fair water planes.
Full dive on stern planes.

790
01:31:18,459 --> 01:31:22,338
Passing 450 feet, going to 1,200.

791
01:31:23,297 --> 01:31:25,300
500.

792
01:31:26,885 --> 01:31:28,679
600.

793
01:31:30,347 --> 01:31:32,349
700.

794
01:31:36,603 --> 01:31:40,357
- Did you get a good fix?
- Yes, Captain.

795
01:31:47,322 --> 01:31:52,077
- Have you got him yet, Jonesy?
- Very faint, sir.

796
01:31:53,663 --> 01:31:58,084
Yes, contact on 250.
Right where he's supposed to be.

797
01:31:58,251 --> 01:32:02,797
- Is he alerted to our presence?
- No, sir.

798
01:32:03,506 --> 01:32:08,094
Come left to 265. Bring us up
behind him quietly.

799
01:32:08,261 --> 01:32:10,805
Make your depth 500 feet.

800
01:32:20,064 --> 01:32:23,402
Please listen to me. Two minutes.

801
01:32:25,571 --> 01:32:29,450
- Time to intercept his track?
- Four minutes.

802
01:32:30,409 --> 01:32:33,287
Very well, Mr Ryan. Two minutes.

803
01:32:39,918 --> 01:32:43,797
I understand that message,
it makes perfect sense.

804
01:32:43,964 --> 01:32:49,053
Ramius intends to defect.
The Russians are trying to sink him.

805
01:32:49,219 --> 01:32:53,183
- They haven't been able to.
- I have a firing solution.

806
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:58,104
Listen to me.
The Russians will stop at nothing.

807
01:32:58,271 --> 01:33:03,526
They've invented this story because
they need our help to sink him.

808
01:33:05,862 --> 01:33:11,201
Weapons control, full safety. I don't
want this fish coming back at us.

809
01:33:11,368 --> 01:33:14,829
I know this man.

810
01:33:15,872 --> 01:33:21,796
Has he made any Crazy Ivans?
His next one will be to starboard.

811
01:33:21,962 --> 01:33:26,926
He always goes to starboard
in the bottom half of the hour.

812
01:33:29,845 --> 01:33:35,643
- Flood tubes one and two.
- You have to establish contact.

813
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:37,645
He wants to defect!

814
01:33:37,812 --> 01:33:42,400
Call Chief Watson to the con
with his sidearm.

815
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,784
Signal-to-noise ratio's dropping.
Possible aspect change in target

816
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:53,328
Concur, based on bearing rate.

817
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:58,166
Crazy Ivan!

818
01:34:00,836 --> 01:34:05,382
Captain, he's turning.

819
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:12,681
- Which way is he turning?
- To the starboard.

820
01:34:13,724 --> 01:34:16,602
Give the man a chance.

821
01:34:18,396 --> 01:34:21,190
- All back full.
- Say again.

822
01:34:21,357 --> 01:34:24,861
- All back full!
- Aye, sir.

823
01:34:29,699 --> 01:34:35,538
- We're cavitating! He can hear us.
- All stop.

824
01:34:36,414 --> 01:34:38,708
Wejust unzipped our fly.

825
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:43,964
Open the outer doors.
Firing point procedures.

826
01:34:44,131 --> 01:34:48,469
If the bastard twitches,
I'm going to blow him to Mars.

827
01:34:48,635 --> 01:34:51,221
All stop. Rudder amidships.

828
01:34:51,388 --> 01:34:55,059
Sonar, can you identify the contact?

829
01:34:55,225 --> 01:35:00,731
Los Angeles class attack sub.
Bearing: 015. Range: 300 metres.

830
01:35:00,898 --> 01:35:03,400
Opening torpedo tube doors.

831
01:35:03,901 --> 01:35:06,570
Outer doors open. Ready to shoot.

832
01:35:06,737 --> 01:35:11,409
Very well. My orders are specific.

833
01:35:11,576 --> 01:35:14,579
He is preparing to fire.

834
01:35:14,746 --> 01:35:20,085
Flood tubes three and four
and plot a solution.

835
01:35:22,337 --> 01:35:25,340
Shall I open the torpedo tube doors?

836
01:35:27,425 --> 01:35:31,429
- Shall I open the outer doors?
- No.

837
01:35:32,806 --> 01:35:36,685
Lock the firing solution
into the computer.

838
01:35:36,851 --> 01:35:39,855
Do not open the doors.

839
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:52,284
Aye, Captain.
Lock solution into computer.

840
01:35:52,994 --> 01:35:57,289
- Target has flooded his tubes.
- Has he opened his outer doors?

841
01:35:57,456 --> 01:36:00,710
Negative. He's just sitting there.

842
01:36:02,545 --> 01:36:07,550
- Target is coming shallow.
- What does that mean?

843
01:36:09,511 --> 01:36:12,514
It means he's a very cool customer.

844
01:36:12,681 --> 01:36:18,186
He knows we're ready to shoot.
He's heading for the surface.

845
01:36:18,353 --> 01:36:22,941
- What's his course now?
- 270. Due west.

846
01:36:23,108 --> 01:36:26,236
Bring us alongside him.

847
01:36:26,403 --> 01:36:29,281
Sonar, report all contacts.

848
01:36:29,448 --> 01:36:33,952
My only contact is Typhoon 7.

849
01:36:34,119 --> 01:36:39,125
- Very well. Range to target?
- Range is 300 yards.

850
01:36:40,626 --> 01:36:43,004
Make your depth 65 feet.

851
01:36:46,215 --> 01:36:50,470
He wants to go up and take a peek.
We'll play along.

852
01:37:10,532 --> 01:37:12,534
Weapons status?

853
01:37:12,701 --> 01:37:17,331
Tubes three and four are flooded,
but outer doors are closed.

854
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:21,585
Mark this bearing.

855
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:35,684
You wanted to talk to him.
What do you want to say?

856
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:40,397
Will he be the only one looking
through the periscope?

857
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:43,566
We'll have to chance that.

858
01:37:44,234 --> 01:37:47,946
"US told you intend missile launch.

859
01:37:48,822 --> 01:37:53,743
"Do not approach US coast
or you will be attacked.

860
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:59,040
"If intention is other,
will you discuss option?"

861
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:02,837
Can he acknowledge
with a single ping?

862
01:38:03,004 --> 01:38:07,591
He can. The question is, will he?

863
01:38:14,223 --> 01:38:19,854
Verify our range to target.
One ping only.

864
01:38:21,272 --> 01:38:23,607
Aye, Captain.

865
01:38:29,155 --> 01:38:32,617
I'll be damned. Now what?

866
01:38:35,203 --> 01:38:39,916
All right. "If defection..."

867
01:38:45,672 --> 01:38:49,968
Chart. I need a chart.

868
01:38:52,763 --> 01:38:57,642
Where the hell are we?
Someplace deep.

869
01:39:00,104 --> 01:39:02,857
OK, send him this.

870
01:39:06,652 --> 01:39:11,074
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just send it.

871
01:39:14,327 --> 01:39:19,540
How did you know
he was going to go to starboard?

872
01:39:19,707 --> 01:39:25,338
I didn't. I had a 50-50 chance
and I needed a break. Sorry.

873
01:39:26,965 --> 01:39:30,469
That's all right, my Morse is so rusty,

874
01:39:30,636 --> 01:39:35,307
I may be sending him dimensions
on Playmate of the Month.

875
01:39:53,867 --> 01:39:56,037
Reverify our range to target.

876
01:39:57,747 --> 01:40:01,835
- One ping only.
- Captain, I just...

877
01:40:02,002 --> 01:40:06,464
Give me a ping, Vassily.
One ping only, please.

878
01:40:09,259 --> 01:40:11,720
Aye, Captain.

879
01:40:15,557 --> 01:40:18,476
What the hell is this about?

880
01:40:18,643 --> 01:40:24,734
The Russians want us to sink her.
We might have to do that.

881
01:40:32,241 --> 01:40:36,412
We must give this American
a wide berth.

882
01:40:37,455 --> 01:40:39,457
Let us turn south.

883
01:40:49,425 --> 01:40:55,891
Mr Kamarov,
plot a new course due south.

884
01:40:57,934 --> 01:41:00,270
New course: 180.

885
01:41:34,722 --> 01:41:37,392
Shut down the reactor!

886
01:41:38,726 --> 01:41:43,064
- Seal the ventilation system.
- The ventilation controls have failed.

887
01:41:43,231 --> 01:41:46,609
Everybody out!
Clear the compartment!

888
01:41:58,038 --> 01:42:02,668
- Shut the ventilation system down.
- The controls don't respond.

889
01:42:02,835 --> 01:42:06,005
Bypass it. Seal it manually. Move!

890
01:42:07,715 --> 01:42:09,717
Say again.

891
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,020
We suffered a leak in the cooling tube.

892
01:42:20,186 --> 01:42:23,606
The ventilation circuits are disabled.

893
01:42:24,524 --> 01:42:28,778
- The coolant is contaminated.
- I knew it was damaged.

894
01:42:28,945 --> 01:42:31,781
Radiation alarms
activating in all compartments.

895
01:42:31,948 --> 01:42:35,243
Engineering heavily contaminated,
radiation moving forward.

896
01:42:35,410 --> 01:42:40,999
Get us to periscope depth.
We'll ventilate with outside air.

897
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:44,211
Ventilating won't do anything.
Get the men off.

898
01:42:44,378 --> 01:42:48,215
- What is the battery condition?
- Four hours.

899
01:42:48,382 --> 01:42:53,888
- Engage battery system.
- The whole ship is contaminated.

900
01:42:54,055 --> 01:42:57,391
We've got to get the men off.

901
01:42:57,558 --> 01:43:00,686
Sir, we have been sabotaged.

902
01:43:00,853 --> 01:43:05,232
- Who said anything about sabotage?
- Captain!

903
01:43:05,399 --> 01:43:07,985
I'm afraid the doctor is right.

904
01:43:12,991 --> 01:43:17,704
Very well. Surface.
We'll evacuate the men to the deck.

905
01:43:17,871 --> 01:43:22,918
Surface the ship. Muster
all personnel to escape hatches.

906
01:43:23,085 --> 01:43:30,258
Break out the rafts. We'll use them
as shelters until the fleet arrives.

907
01:44:12,636 --> 01:44:18,267
Make sure the count is accurate.
We must get the entire crew out.

908
01:44:18,434 --> 01:44:22,646
Master at Arms reports rafts secure
and evacuation proceeding.

909
01:44:22,813 --> 01:44:25,149
Very good.

910
01:44:30,696 --> 01:44:36,660
No officer will spend more
than 20 minutes below deck.

911
01:44:36,827 --> 01:44:38,496
- Satisfactory?
- Completely.

912
01:44:38,663 --> 01:44:44,961
Surface contact: 270.
Six miles and closing fast.

913
01:44:45,128 --> 01:44:48,757
- It's a warship!
- Here? Can you identify?

914
01:44:48,923 --> 01:44:54,846
It's a US frigate.
Probably Perry class. He's signalling.

915
01:44:55,013 --> 01:45:00,518
"Red October,
halt and stay where you are.

916
01:45:00,685 --> 01:45:05,691
"Do not attempt to submerge
or you will be fired upon."

917
01:45:07,068 --> 01:45:10,029
He means to board us.

918
01:45:16,118 --> 01:45:21,582
You will go with the crew. The officers
and I will submerge beneath you.

919
01:45:21,749 --> 01:45:27,338
- We'll scuttle the ship.
- You'll receive the Order of Lenin.

920
01:45:37,015 --> 01:45:39,559
Prepare to cast off.

921
01:45:39,726 --> 01:45:42,729
The captain is going
to scuttle the ship.

922
01:45:47,484 --> 01:45:52,155
- He's going down, sir.
- Put a shot across his bow.

923
01:46:23,730 --> 01:46:26,816
Seahawk One, this is Bravo Command.

924
01:46:44,293 --> 01:46:46,962
She's ready.

925
01:46:47,463 --> 01:46:49,673
Release on my command.

926
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,801
Drop now, now, now.

927
01:47:01,311 --> 01:47:05,899
Range to target 900 yards.
800 yards.

928
01:47:08,818 --> 01:47:13,573
700 yards. 600 yards.

929
01:47:18,661 --> 01:47:24,125
500 yards. 400 yards.

930
01:47:26,169 --> 01:47:27,880
300 yards.

931
01:47:31,008 --> 01:47:33,677
The torpedo is detonated.

932
01:47:34,303 --> 01:47:40,601
That torpedo did not self-destruct.
You heard it hit the hull.

933
01:47:40,768 --> 01:47:44,021
And I was never here.

934
01:47:45,064 --> 01:47:50,444
- GiveDallasthe go.
- Get the DSRV moving.

935
01:47:58,745 --> 01:48:02,708
Two million things
can still go wrong with this stunt.

936
01:48:02,874 --> 01:48:07,879
Central Intelligence Agency...
there's a contradiction in terms.

937
01:48:09,715 --> 01:48:12,467
How's the coffee, Ryan?

938
01:48:19,850 --> 01:48:25,982
- Hatch is secured.
- We're ready to launch.

939
01:48:26,149 --> 01:48:31,487
- Flood the skirt.
- Skirt filled and equalised.

940
01:48:31,654 --> 01:48:36,034
- Ready to lift off.
- OK, let's do it.

941
01:48:39,162 --> 01:48:41,539
Thrusting to port.

942
01:49:01,685 --> 01:49:07,524
- 600 yards and closing.
- Steer right to course 075.

943
01:49:12,321 --> 01:49:17,618
200 yards. 100 yards.

944
01:49:25,126 --> 01:49:27,545
Hit the lights.

945
01:49:40,433 --> 01:49:43,311
Jesus! That's a big sucker.

946
01:49:59,161 --> 01:50:03,666
- OK, we're in position.
- You can open the hatch.

947
01:50:03,833 --> 01:50:10,047
Hold it a second.
Jonesy... Mr Ryan...

948
01:50:13,801 --> 01:50:18,682
- He's defecting.
- And he can't change his mind?

949
01:50:18,849 --> 01:50:24,187
- He's not going to change his mind.
- Will you bet your life on that?

950
01:50:44,207 --> 01:50:47,587
Sir, could you hand me that hammer?

951
01:51:09,901 --> 01:51:11,986
Americans.

952
01:52:53,467 --> 01:52:56,887
He's turning green...

953
01:53:19,702 --> 01:53:22,372
What's so funny?

954
01:53:23,331 --> 01:53:27,335
The captain thinks
you're some sort of cowboy.

955
01:53:28,461 --> 01:53:30,213
You speak Russian.

956
01:53:31,672 --> 01:53:33,883
A little.

957
01:53:35,219 --> 01:53:38,764
It's wise to study the ways
of one's adversary.

958
01:53:38,931 --> 01:53:41,225
Don't you think?

959
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:43,727
It is.

960
01:53:45,646 --> 01:53:50,567
I doubt that you remember, but
we met at the consulate in Leningrad.

961
01:53:50,734 --> 01:53:53,904
Along with your wife. I'm very sorry.

962
01:53:56,699 --> 01:54:01,203
What gives you the right
to fire on my ship?

963
01:54:01,370 --> 01:54:05,625
- You said nothing of a torpedo.
- Ryan.

964
01:54:07,043 --> 01:54:12,757
- We had to maintain the illusion.
- Are my crew being rescued?

965
01:54:12,924 --> 01:54:14,592
As we speak.

966
01:54:18,972 --> 01:54:22,976
- You sent the signal?
- That's correct, sir.

967
01:54:24,018 --> 01:54:30,025
How did you know that
our reactor accident was false?

968
01:54:30,191 --> 01:54:33,529
That was a guess,
but it seemed logical.

969
01:54:40,036 --> 01:54:42,038
Very well.

970
01:54:45,458 --> 01:54:50,921
I present you the ballistic missile
submarineRed October.

971
01:54:55,301 --> 01:55:01,892
My officers and I request asylum
in the USA.

972
01:55:04,227 --> 01:55:09,649
It's a pleasure, sir.
Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

973
01:55:11,818 --> 01:55:14,446
Torpedo!
The Americans are shooting.

974
01:55:14,613 --> 01:55:17,449
The pitch is too high. It's Russian.

975
01:55:19,034 --> 01:55:21,328
Another torpedo?

976
01:55:21,495 --> 01:55:25,332
Sonar contact.
Alfa class Soviet submarine.

977
01:55:29,003 --> 01:55:35,343
- Why don't I have a detonation?
- The weapon armed too late.

978
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:39,680
You had the wrong range.
Fire again with the right settings.

979
01:55:39,847 --> 01:55:43,643
Get me power, and get that
damn thing off my boat.

980
01:55:45,144 --> 01:55:50,858
- Somebody just shot at us.
- No shit! Get out of here.

981
01:55:59,034 --> 01:56:01,120
The Captain is fighting them.

982
01:56:01,286 --> 01:56:05,207
The Captain is fighting the Americans.
The Captain is fighting the Americans.

983
01:56:05,874 --> 01:56:08,335
Borodin, fire control.

984
01:56:09,044 --> 01:56:14,133
- Ryan, sit here.
- I'm not with the Navy. I'm CIA.

985
01:56:14,299 --> 01:56:19,555
- CIA?
- I write books for them.

986
01:56:19,722 --> 01:56:22,891
Sit down and do what I tell you.

987
01:56:23,058 --> 01:56:26,479
Russian Alfa,
8,000 yards to starboard.

988
01:56:26,646 --> 01:56:29,899
- I think it's theKonovalov.
- Increase to flank.

989
01:56:30,066 --> 01:56:32,986
Increase to flank? How?

990
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:36,990
That knob, turn right full.

991
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:42,078
- All ahead flank. Right full rudder.
- He's shooting again.

992
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:45,415
Go to battle stations.

993
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:55,342
- Torpedo in the water. Bearing 315.
- Make range 7,000 yards.

994
01:56:55,509 --> 01:57:01,891
- Steer right 315.
- That's heading into the torpedo.

995
01:57:02,058 --> 01:57:08,439
- Estimate range 6,000 yards.
- Steer right 315.

996
01:57:08,606 --> 01:57:12,985
That's wrong!
Ryan, don't turn that wheel.

997
01:57:13,152 --> 01:57:15,363
315.

998
01:57:26,458 --> 01:57:30,796
- You're heading straight for it.
- Yes.

999
01:57:31,088 --> 01:57:34,841
- Doing what?
- He's turning into it.

1000
01:57:35,008 --> 01:57:40,180
- He's directly in the torpedo's path.
- Mother of God!

1001
01:57:40,347 --> 01:57:44,768
Torpedo steady at 315.
Range: 5,000 yards.

1002
01:57:44,935 --> 01:57:48,939
- More speed.
- We're already at 110÷/o.

1003
01:57:49,106 --> 01:57:54,946
- Then get me 115÷/o.
- Range: 3,000 yards and closing fast.

1004
01:58:01,536 --> 01:58:07,583
- He's heading right into the torpedo.
- Can we shoot at the Russian Alfa?

1005
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:12,463
I can't attack a Soviet submarine
without authorisation.

1006
01:58:15,174 --> 01:58:20,180
Torpedo steady at 315.
Range: 900 yards.

1007
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:25,269
Torpedo impact: 20 seconds.

1008
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:30,482
- What books?
- Pardon me?

1009
01:58:30,649 --> 01:58:37,448
- What books did you write?
- A biography on Admiral Halsey.

1010
01:58:37,614 --> 01:58:42,911
- It's about naval combat tactics.
- I know this book.

1011
01:58:43,078 --> 01:58:48,168
Your conclusions were all wrong.
Halsey acted stupidly.

1012
01:58:48,334 --> 01:58:53,423
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1013
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:59,054
five, four, three, two...

1014
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:02,849
Torpedo impact now.

1015
01:59:12,067 --> 01:59:14,152
I'll be damned.

1016
01:59:16,155 --> 01:59:20,659
- What happened?
- Combat tactics.

1017
01:59:20,826 --> 01:59:26,499
The captain closed the distance
before the torpedo could arm itself.

1018
01:59:26,665 --> 01:59:29,710
- That's it?
- Not quite.

1019
01:59:29,877 --> 01:59:36,967
Captain Tupolev will be removing
the safety features on all his weapons.

1020
01:59:37,968 --> 01:59:42,765
- Vassily, have you plotted a solution?
- It's a little rough...

1021
01:59:49,189 --> 01:59:52,442
- Gunfire.
- That's what it sounded like.

1022
01:59:52,609 --> 01:59:56,446
- He won't change his mind?
- It's one of the crew.

1023
01:59:56,613 --> 01:59:59,950
I'd say he's having second thoughts.

1024
02:00:16,467 --> 02:00:20,138
I would like to have seen Montana.

1025
02:00:32,984 --> 02:00:39,031
He's in the missile bay.
We're showing a warning on number 20.

1026
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:44,204
- He can't launch a missile?
- No, but he can blow one up.

1027
02:00:45,748 --> 02:00:50,461
Captain, take the con.
Get in behind him and stay there.

1028
02:00:50,627 --> 02:00:52,254
Captain, wait.

1029
02:00:56,175 --> 02:00:58,844
You may need this, sir.

1030
02:01:01,847 --> 02:01:03,515
Thank you.

1031
02:01:07,019 --> 02:01:13,026
Don't just stand there, go with him!
You, get your butt over here.

1032
02:01:13,193 --> 02:01:19,783
- The torpedo broke up on impact.
- Set the safety ranges for zero.

1033
02:01:19,949 --> 02:01:25,372
We must get him before he gets
to the ignition circuits.

1034
02:01:31,878 --> 02:01:34,923
What happens if he gets
to the ignition circuitry?

1035
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:38,094
He can incinerate the ship.

1036
02:01:45,643 --> 02:01:50,398
- Is that the only way out of here?
- Yes.

1037
02:01:51,482 --> 02:01:55,736
- Don't let him get past you.
- Ryan...

1038
02:01:55,903 --> 02:01:59,323
...be careful what you shoot at.

1039
02:01:59,490 --> 02:02:04,245
Most things in here
don't react too well to bullets.

1040
02:02:06,331 --> 02:02:07,833
Right.

1041
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:29,104
Be careful what I shoot at?

1042
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:41,117
- Safety ranges set to zero.
- Where'sRed October?

1043
02:02:41,284 --> 02:02:47,290
- She's behind us.
- Right full rudder. I'll shake him loose.

1044
02:02:53,463 --> 02:02:56,966
- He's going deep.
- 30 degree down angle.

1045
02:02:57,133 --> 02:02:59,969
Order counter measures.

1046
02:03:25,496 --> 02:03:29,501
The Alfa is too quick.
It's only a matter of time.

1047
02:03:30,168 --> 02:03:34,589
"Some things in here
don't react well to bullets..."

1048
02:03:34,756 --> 02:03:38,760
Yeah, like me,
I don't react well to bullets.

1049
02:03:58,030 --> 02:04:01,367
- Where is he?
- Close, sir.

1050
02:04:03,452 --> 02:04:06,705
- 900 metres, directly ahead.
- Got him.

1051
02:04:06,872 --> 02:04:09,959
- Mark bearings and fire.
- We are too close!

1052
02:04:10,126 --> 02:04:15,756
Don't argue with me.
Launch the weapon! Do it now!

1053
02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:20,761
Another torpedo, it went active
as it was launched.

1054
02:04:20,928 --> 02:04:25,725
- Left full rudder. Ease her up.
- I think he's got us.

1055
02:04:35,902 --> 02:04:37,571
Way to go, Dallas!

1056
02:04:42,826 --> 02:04:47,289
Torpedo in acquisition.
Range 500 yards. You've done it.

1057
02:04:47,456 --> 02:04:51,918
I hope this works.
Chief, put us on the roof.

1058
02:04:52,085 --> 02:04:56,090
Counter measures on my mark.
Five, four...

1059
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:03,931
Release counter measures.
Emergency blow. Full rise.

1060
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:14,442
500 feet.

1061
02:05:15,276 --> 02:05:18,112
Come on, Big D. Fly!

1062
02:05:31,752 --> 02:05:34,797
Captain scared 'em out of the water!!

1063
02:05:37,091 --> 02:05:40,803
That torpedo is still active.
It's searching for another target.

1064
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:08,164
A goddamn cook!

1065
02:06:33,983 --> 02:06:36,944
It's locked on us!

1066
02:06:37,111 --> 02:06:40,865
- How close is that Alfa?
- 1,000 yards dead astern.

1067
02:06:41,031 --> 02:06:42,950
- Reverse your turn.
- Aye, sir.

1068
02:06:48,331 --> 02:06:52,544
We're turning straight at him.
The torpedo is still on our tail.

1069
02:06:56,965 --> 02:07:01,219
The hard part about playing chicken
is knowing when to flinch.

1070
02:07:06,641 --> 02:07:10,604
Collision in 400 yards, 350, 300...

1071
02:07:10,771 --> 02:07:12,773
Captain!

1072
02:07:12,939 --> 02:07:16,694
Right full rudder. 30 degree down angle.

1073
02:07:16,861 --> 02:07:18,780
This one's going to be close!

1074
02:07:23,076 --> 02:07:26,913
- Torpedo, dead ahead!
- You arrogant ass, you've killed us.

1075
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:58,445
We have ascertained
the Red October's final position.

1076
02:08:00,030 --> 02:08:04,785
Given the depth of the water
and the spread of the wreckage,

1077
02:08:04,952 --> 02:08:07,788
nothing has yet been recovered.

1078
02:08:07,955 --> 02:08:14,504
Your people are with the crew,
making arrangements for their return.

1079
02:08:14,671 --> 02:08:18,216
This has been a terrible tragedy.

1080
02:08:18,383 --> 02:08:22,721
If you'd come to us earlier,
it might have been avoided.

1081
02:08:24,848 --> 02:08:30,812
- I appreciate your candour in this.
- And I yours, Andrei.

1082
02:08:33,523 --> 02:08:39,237
In the future, technology may allow
an investigation of the wreckage.

1083
02:08:39,988 --> 02:08:41,991
Perhaps.

1084
02:08:47,496 --> 02:08:51,542
There is another matter,
one that I'm reluctant to...

1085
02:08:55,337 --> 02:09:02,386
One of our submarines, an Alfa,
was last reported in the Grand Banks.

1086
02:09:02,553 --> 02:09:07,016
We've not heard from her for some time.

1087
02:09:08,184 --> 02:09:12,731
Andrei, you've lost another submarine?

1088
02:09:27,454 --> 02:09:32,709
All this way to hide
a submarine in a river.

1089
02:09:32,876 --> 02:09:38,925
We're 100 miles from any naval base.
It's the last place a satellite will look.

1090
02:09:40,551 --> 02:09:43,388
I grew up around here.

1091
02:09:44,889 --> 02:09:49,894
My grandfather taught me to fish
off that island over there.

1092
02:09:52,814 --> 02:09:59,070
There is one question
you haven't asked me yet: Why?

1093
02:10:01,489 --> 02:10:04,951
I figured you would tell me
when you were ready.

1094
02:10:07,871 --> 02:10:12,376
There are those who believe
we should attack the USA first.

1095
02:10:12,543 --> 02:10:15,379
Settle everything in one moment.

1096
02:10:15,546 --> 02:10:19,383
Red Octoberwas built
for that purpose.

1097
02:10:19,550 --> 02:10:24,763
- There'll be hell to pay in Moscow.
- Perhaps.

1098
02:10:24,930 --> 02:10:28,100
Maybe some good will come from it.

1099
02:10:28,267 --> 02:10:33,522
A little revolution now and then
is a healthy thing.

1100
02:10:39,946 --> 02:10:43,450
Do you still like to fish?

1101
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:48,955
There's a river not unlike this
near Vilnius,

1102
02:10:49,122 --> 02:10:52,751
where my grandfather
taught me to fish.

1103
02:10:54,836 --> 02:10:59,632
"And the sea will grant
each man new hope,

1104
02:10:59,799 --> 02:11:04,638
"his sleep brings dreams of home."

1105
02:11:09,643 --> 02:11:12,396
Christopher Columbus.

1106
02:11:16,233 --> 02:11:19,987
Welcome to the new world, sir.

1107
02:11:20,305 --> 02:12:20,661

3
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,319
All the way from the capital.

4
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:25,341
Colonel Joll?

5
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:39,955
It's an honor to have you here.

6
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:51,934
Well, you... you must
be exhausted. Please.

7
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:08,317
Tell me, i-if you
don't mind me asking,

8
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,320
what... what are they for?

9
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,855
They protect one's eyes

10
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:16,458
against the glare of the sun.

11
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:18,194
They save one from squinting.

12
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,030
- Ah.
- Do you see?

13
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:23,332
No wrinkles.

14
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,335
Fewer headaches.

15
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,838
Yes, at home,
everyone is wearing them.

16
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,942
You would find them useful

17
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:34,143
out here in the desert.

18
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:35,411
Hmm.

19
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:43,818
Are you familiar with
these parts of the frontier?

20
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:45,820
No.

21
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,924
Not with this part, no.

22
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:53,996
With the south,
but not with this part, not yet.

23
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,798
Well, it's not a good time
of the year to visit.

24
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,901
You must feel the heat.

25
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:01,203
I'm quite used to it, the heat.

26
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,241
I have leave due to me,

27
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:09,245
but I-I find myself
reluctant to take it.

28
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,447
One grows to be
a part of a place.

29
00:06:13,215 --> 00:06:17,987
I'd feel like a foreigner
if I went back to the capital.

30
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,356
And the capital,
too, has changed,

31
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:24,126
I'm sure, since my time.

32
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:27,129
I need to make an early start
of my inspection.

33
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,465
Breakfast early, please,
first thing.

34
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:30,832
Yes, sir.

35
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:33,102
So if you will excuse me,

36
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:35,137
I need to get some rest.

37
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:39,008
I'll come by in the morning
and fetch you.

38
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,063
Magistrate.

39
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:21,550
But a soldier?

40
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,218
They... They don't
usually send soldiers

41
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:24,420
on inspections, do they?

42
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:26,588
Mm, who's the inspector now?

43
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:29,325
You're far too inquisitive,
my friend.

44
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:30,626
No, he's not a soldier.

45
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,860
He wears a uniform,
but he's not a soldier.

46
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:35,064
He's a policeman,
a colonel of the police,

47
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:39,335
very important person from
the Bureau of State Security.

48
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:42,371
Once in every generation,

49
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:45,307
without fail,
along the frontier,

50
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:50,879
there is an episode of hysteria
about the barbarians.

51
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:54,249
It's the consequence
of too much ease.

52
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:56,318
Why don't they leave us alone?

53
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:59,188
They have their own territories,
don't they?

54
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,457
We have to protect ourselves.

55
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,025
Protect ourselves, my dear?

56
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:05,327
Against what? Against whom?

57
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,628
Against them.

58
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:08,897
We protect ourselves
against wild animals,

59
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:10,499
against snakes.

60
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,435
If an angry bear
approaches you,

61
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,137
you'd kill it, Magistrate,
wouldn't you?

62
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,106
No, my friends.

63
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,241
I-I will be quite content

64
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:22,344
to pass quietly away
and merit no more

65
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:25,447
than three lines
in the imperial gazette

66
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:28,317
that with nudge here
and a touch there,

67
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,153
I kept the world
on its course.

68
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,254
We ready to go?

69
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:18,133
I must tell you
that we don't have

70
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,169
proper facilities
for prisoners.

71
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:21,603
There's no need.

72
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:24,573
There's not much...
There's not much crime here,

73
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:29,211
and the penalty's usually
a fine or compulsory labor,

74
00:09:29,244 --> 00:09:31,346
so we simply use
the old barracks.

75
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,450
Where we
also store provisions.

76
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,057
Just a minute.

77
00:09:43,091 --> 00:09:44,493
Let me speak with them.

78
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:46,995
I know a little of the language.

79
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,424
I think it must be your glasses.

80
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:19,228
He's probably never
seen anything like them before.

81
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:21,997
He may think that you're blind.

82
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:38,614
Hmm?

83
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:40,148
Do you understand?

84
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,253
Show the Excellency.

85
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,195
Hmm.

86
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,597
It's his sister's boy.

87
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,166
They've come to get medicine.

88
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:38,440
...Excellency.

89
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,310
All right.

90
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:42,311
Thank you.

91
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,114
Whatever you call it,

92
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:48,850
banditry, sheep stealing,

93
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:52,387
it really...
it doesn't amount to much.

94
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,324
These nomads,
barbarians, if you will,

95
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,793
will be gone in a month
back up into the mountains.

96
00:11:57,826 --> 00:12:01,196
They migrate.
They're always on the move.

97
00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:02,831
He says he came for medicine.

98
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:05,902
He may be telling the truth.
Who knows?

99
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:09,504
Who would have brought
an old man and a sick boy

100
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:11,206
along on a raiding party?

101
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,609
Nevertheless,
I will question them.

102
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,779
You can learn surprising things.

103
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:20,816
I'll bring one of my men along,

104
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,485
and I will need someone
to assist with the language.

105
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,621
Well, let me.
I-I'd be glad to help.

106
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:26,622
No, no.

107
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:28,590
You would find it tedious.

108
00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:32,527
We have set procedures.

109
00:12:33,762 --> 00:12:38,467
Uh, tell me,
wh-what are your procedures?

110
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,738
Patience...

111
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:45,574
and pressure.

112
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:50,412
That is the only way
to get to the truth.

113
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:52,614
But how do you know

114
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,416
you are hearing the truth?

115
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:59,354
There is a certain tone.

116
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,292
A certain tone enters the voice.

117
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:11,767
You come to recognize it
with training and experience.

118
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:17,839
Can you tell
whether I am telling the truth?

119
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:22,778
You misunderstand.

120
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:25,681
I am speaking
of particular situations,

121
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:29,184
situations where I
am probing for the truth.

122
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,523
First you get lies.

123
00:13:35,724 --> 00:13:37,994
First lies,

124
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,828
then pressure,

125
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,830
then more lies,

126
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,532
then more pressure...

127
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:48,637
then more lies, more pressure...

128
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:52,641
and then comes the break.

129
00:13:54,576 --> 00:13:57,212
After the break,
more pressure...

130
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:03,852
and then at last the truth.

131
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,224
That is how you get it.

132
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,861
Pain is truth.

133
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:16,264
All else is subject to doubt.

134
00:14:20,036 --> 00:14:22,504
No, that one says
that the very same pig

135
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:24,773
keeps breaking in to his garden
and damaging the produce,

136
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:26,641
and now he's not going
to give it back

137
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:27,676
until he's paid compensation.

138
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:34,316
Excellency, the pig
is worth a lot of money.

139
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:37,285
His garden is worth nothing,
nothing.

140
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:39,654
It's a nothing
that has no proper fence.

141
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:41,790
Be quiet. Be quiet.

142
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:44,793
Everybody knows that he
doesn't have a proper title.

143
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:46,062
He can't put up a fence,

144
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,363
because he doesn't have
a proper title.

145
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:51,299
- Come on. Show him your title.
- Just be quiet, please.

146
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,335
Sir...

147
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:56,005
if I can speak
to the Excellency?

148
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:59,307
I have warned him many times
about his pig,

149
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:01,510
and he pays no attention.

150
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,645
Why must I suffer for his pig?

151
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:07,749
"His pig." You have his pig.

152
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,417
I have his pig,

153
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,320
and I am keeping it
until he pays for the damages.

154
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,589
Why should I pay?
Who says I should pay?

155
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,458
Give him back his pig.

156
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,727
And?

157
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:23,799
And that is all.

158
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,330
Sir.

159
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,551
- Your bed's ready, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:18,955
- Anything more?
- No, thank you.

161
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:23,558
What is that?

162
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:27,462
This is... It's a child's shoe
from long ago.

163
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:28,965
- Shoe?
- Mm-hmm.

164
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,867
You're gonna keep it?

165
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:34,636
Mm-hmm.

166
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:48,783
What does it say?

167
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:50,987
I have no idea.

168
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,090
It's old writing...

169
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:56,825
from the old days.

170
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,963
No one writes like this anymore.

171
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:08,097
There's a letter
from the Colonel.

172
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:50,572
D-Did you see what happened?

173
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:18,100
Close it.

174
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,936
Close it. Close it.

175
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:26,641
Tie it shut.

176
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:35,084
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.

177
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:08,716
What have they done to him?

178
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,019
A knife.

179
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,022
Just a little knife like this.

180
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:28,337
Ah. He wants water.
Give it to him.

181
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:30,805
And...

182
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:36,778
have that removed,
taken out of here immediately.

183
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,986
And what does this mean?

184
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:45,720
It means...

185
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:49,225
that we have
our first confession,

186
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:52,727
means that I am doing
what I was sent here to do.

187
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,197
It means that we are
beginning to understand

188
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:57,199
what is going on
on the border.

189
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,436
Today we have
the beginnings of information

190
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:04,073
and now are in the position
to go out and gather more.

191
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:05,840
- I...
- First thing tomorrow morning,

192
00:21:05,874 --> 00:21:07,977
I shall be taking out
a party with that boy...

193
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,679
yes, that same boy...
as my guide.

194
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:15,317
I think he will be a good guide.

195
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,652
He knows by now what I want.

196
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:23,791
As for you, it would be helpful

197
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,827
if you would put together
some pack animals

198
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,863
and some provisions
for a week or so

199
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:29,965
and a dozen of your men,

200
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:33,668
good men
familiar with the country.

201
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,740
What kind of information,
sheep stealing? Smuggling?

202
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:41,977
Are you killing old men
for sheep now?

203
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:54,789
Record of the interrogation.

204
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:16,078
Come away. Come away.

205
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:23,419
Did you really tell the officer
that your clan is arming itself?

206
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:26,255
Did you really say
that there will be

207
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:29,225
a great war against the Empire?

208
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:30,926
It's stupid.

209
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,028
Why do you tell such lies?

210
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,168
I think he's very sick, sir,

211
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:41,103
very sick and very sore.

212
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,175
W-With no disrespect, Colonel,

213
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:49,378
you've never campaigned on this
inhospitable frontier before

214
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:53,415
You have no guide except a child
who's terrified of you.

215
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:55,117
As for them,
you cannot rely on them.

216
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,952
They're conscripts.
Most of them have never been

217
00:22:56,986 --> 00:22:58,954
more than five miles
from this settlement.

218
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:01,190
The barbarians
whom you are chasing will...

219
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:03,825
will vanish into the desert
before you catch sight of them.

220
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:05,494
They live here.
This is their land.

221
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:08,097
They know every inch of it.
You do not.

222
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,864
I have orders to obey.

223
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:14,136
May I remind you, Colonel,
that if you get lost,

224
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:17,139
it will be up to me to find you

225
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:20,142
and bring you back
to civilization.

226
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:21,210
Of course.

227
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,948
Don't stake your life
on my maps, sir.

228
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:27,349
I'm not a surveyor.

229
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:28,816
I patched them together

230
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,919
from tales told to me
by travelers.

231
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:32,121
I've never been
where you're going.

232
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:34,923
I earnestly advise you
not to go.

233
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,514
82.

234
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:35,984
82.

235
00:24:45,494 --> 00:24:47,363
Why must you...

236
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,132
send people...

237
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,037
with no... no experience

238
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,040
of the frontier t...

239
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,176
to investigate...

240
00:25:02,678 --> 00:25:06,548
unrest on the frontier?

241
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,886
Why...

242
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:14,056
Why can't you just...

243
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:17,426
Why can't you just leave, um...

244
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,527
well enough...

245
00:25:20,362 --> 00:25:21,430
alone?

246
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:17,286
Keep moving.

247
00:27:13,642 --> 00:27:14,743
Star?

248
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:25,687
Come in.

249
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,702
I thought you were one of them.

250
00:27:43,672 --> 00:27:45,374
They give me the shivers.

251
00:27:52,781 --> 00:27:54,316
Isn't he your friend?

252
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,287
The one...

253
00:28:07,763 --> 00:28:10,098
Can I fetch you
something to drink?

254
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:19,341
No?

255
00:28:22,644 --> 00:28:25,147
Is there nothing
I can do for you?

256
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:57,112
Something on your mind?

257
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:00,148
Hmm.

258
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,728
They will soon be gone.

259
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:16,398
Things will return to normal.

260
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:22,504
I wish I could believe you.

261
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,171
Give them a shovel.

262
00:29:57,406 --> 00:29:59,841
Let them dig a latrine,
at least.

263
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:13,221
Sir, Colonel Joll is... is here.

264
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:22,831
We will be leaving today.

265
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,833
Sir.

266
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:28,637
So soon?

267
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,839
Yes, we have completed
our investigations.

268
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,408
Now I must hurry back
and make my report.

269
00:30:33,442 --> 00:30:35,978
Anything I can do
to facilita...

270
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:39,347
No, no. I believe we have
everything we came for.

271
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:47,622
Cup of tea.

272
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:51,894
And your inquiries, Colonel,

273
00:30:51,928 --> 00:30:53,829
among the nomad peoples...

274
00:30:55,831 --> 00:30:57,699
have they been successful?

275
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,035
Yes.

276
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:02,871
I think I can say
we've had some success,

277
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:04,673
particularly when you consider

278
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:07,442
that this is only part
of a great enterprise.

279
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:10,913
Similar investigations
are being carried out

280
00:31:10,947 --> 00:31:14,349
elsewhere in the frontier
in a very coordinated fashion

281
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:15,918
with the cooperation

282
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:19,354
of the various
frontier administrators.

283
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:22,591
Well, that is good.

284
00:31:26,495 --> 00:31:28,830
And is it too early to reveal

285
00:31:28,864 --> 00:31:34,803
whether we have anything to fear
from these barbarians this year?

286
00:31:36,738 --> 00:31:42,677
May we still sleep securely
in our beds?

287
00:31:42,711 --> 00:31:45,413
Since all is not well here...

288
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,950
and by no stretch
of the imagination

289
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:49,718
can we say
that all is well here

290
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:52,922
in your little sliver
of the frontier...

291
00:31:56,893 --> 00:31:59,361
I expect further measures
will be taken.

292
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:45,740
- I want everything cleaned up!
- Yes, sir.

293
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:48,844
I want everything
as it was before at once!

294
00:32:48,878 --> 00:32:50,112
What are you doing?

295
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:52,414
What are you doing?!
Let that woman go!

296
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:53,950
Right. Sir.

297
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:58,120
Let all these people go.
Let them go.

298
00:32:58,154 --> 00:32:59,788
Give them their things.
Let 'em go.

299
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:01,823
You all go on.

300
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:02,824
Go!

301
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,928
Out! Come on!

302
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:07,964
- You heard what he said.
- What are you doing?

303
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:09,764
I want... I want these people
out of here!

304
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:12,367
- Go on.
- Out of here right away!

305
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:14,603
Go on! Go!

306
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:19,507
I want them gone.

307
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:08,090
It's late to be out-of-doors.

308
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:31,881
Naim.

309
00:34:31,914 --> 00:34:33,215
Sir?

310
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:35,810
I can see.

311
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:48,958
Please, sit down.

312
00:36:34,702 --> 00:36:36,072
Can you look at me?

313
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:42,178
This is how I look.

314
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:03,598
Where do you live?

315
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:07,169
I live.

316
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:12,740
We do not permit vagrants
in the town.

317
00:37:13,808 --> 00:37:16,412
You must have somewhere to live.

318
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:18,813
Otherwise, you must go
back to your own people.

319
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:19,882
Do you understand?

320
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:26,621
Well...

321
00:37:28,924 --> 00:37:32,128
I offer that you should...

322
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:36,631
come and work here.

323
00:37:42,238 --> 00:37:46,008
Um, either that
or go back to your people.

324
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:49,811
You cannot beg in the street.

325
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:51,213
I cannot permit that.

326
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:54,383
You must have a place to live.

327
00:37:56,952 --> 00:37:58,254
If you work here...

328
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:02,824
you can sleep here, too.

329
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:14,904
I can go?

330
00:38:16,305 --> 00:38:18,740
Yes, go if you want to.

331
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,836
Come. Come inside.

332
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:33,949
Let me see.

333
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:58,240
They broke it.

334
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,945
My, um...

335
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:06,148
Your ankle.

336
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:07,349
My ankle.

337
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:11,387
Other one, too.

338
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:21,376
Welcome, sir.

339
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,478
The Magistrate's waiting.

340
00:43:22,511 --> 00:43:23,979
- Thank you.
- Company, halt.

341
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:27,983
Cheers.

342
00:43:33,222 --> 00:43:35,557
So no trouble
on the way here, then?

343
00:43:35,591 --> 00:43:36,725
Nothing.

344
00:43:36,758 --> 00:43:38,260
Nothing worth mentioning.

345
00:43:38,293 --> 00:43:41,230
I think we were followed
for a while by barbarians,

346
00:43:41,263 --> 00:43:42,331
but that was all.

347
00:43:42,364 --> 00:43:46,401
Are you sure
they were barbarians?

348
00:43:46,435 --> 00:43:49,004
What else could they have been?

349
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:53,442
At brigade headquarters,
they're saying

350
00:43:53,475 --> 00:43:54,776
there is to be
a general offensive

351
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,778
against the barbarians
in the spring.

352
00:43:56,812 --> 00:44:00,716
The plan is to move them back
all along the frontier,

353
00:44:00,749 --> 00:44:02,484
back into the mountains.

354
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:05,454
They can't be serious.

355
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:08,790
The people who... whom you
call barbarians are nomads.

356
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:10,726
They will never
permit themselves

357
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:12,794
to be bottled up
in the mountains.

358
00:44:12,828 --> 00:44:15,764
Well, sorry to be frank.

359
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:18,100
Isn't that what war is about?

360
00:44:19,835 --> 00:44:22,404
Compelling a choice on someone
who would not otherwise make it?

361
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:32,614
Ah.

362
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:37,085
Mm-hmm.

363
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:43,792
Tell me, sir, as someone
who knows the region...

364
00:44:45,527 --> 00:44:47,796
why are these barbarians
so dissatisfied?

365
00:44:49,364 --> 00:44:51,133
What is all the trouble about?

366
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:57,272
Well, what is the trouble about?

367
00:44:59,441 --> 00:45:02,644
Ahem. Well, there was no trouble
that... that I know of...

368
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,648
until outsiders
started interfering.

369
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:09,751
We had peace.

370
00:45:09,785 --> 00:45:12,454
We kept to ourselves.
They kept to themselves.

371
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:16,358
But it's... it's all changed now.

372
00:45:17,793 --> 00:45:21,463
It will take years
to patch up the damage

373
00:45:21,496 --> 00:45:25,133
that Colonel Joll did
in the space of a week.

374
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:28,905
You smile,

375
00:45:28,938 --> 00:45:31,106
but, uh,
I'll tell you something.

376
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:34,576
We, you and I,

377
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:38,915
think of this country as ours,
as part of the Empire.

378
00:45:38,948 --> 00:45:42,851
We say to ourselves we reclaimed
the land from the desert,

379
00:45:42,885 --> 00:45:45,354
we planted it,
we built our homes here,

380
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:47,189
but that's not how they see it.

381
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:52,327
They still see us
as visitors, transients.

382
00:45:52,361 --> 00:45:55,731
They say to one another,
"Be patient.

383
00:45:55,764 --> 00:45:59,301
One day, these foreigners
will pack up and leave."

384
00:45:59,334 --> 00:46:01,870
"They will
never last in the desert."

385
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:05,440
But we're not going to leave.

386
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:09,645
No?

387
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:13,682
Are you sure?

388
00:46:13,715 --> 00:46:16,785
The frontier towns are the first
line of defense of the Empire,

389
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:20,489
so th-there's no question
of abandoning them.

390
00:48:16,671 --> 00:48:18,975
What do you think
they're doing up there?

391
00:48:19,008 --> 00:48:21,276
What do you think? The usual.

392
00:48:23,545 --> 00:48:25,747
Doesn't usually
bring girls up there.

393
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:28,951
He's strict about that.

394
00:48:28,985 --> 00:48:30,485
Well, he's getting old.

395
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:34,756
Ah, he's still
a very good-looking man.

396
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,292
Have you got your eye on him?

397
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:40,096
Have you got your eye on him,
Grandma?

398
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:41,563
That's enough now.

399
00:48:41,596 --> 00:48:43,431
Come on. Bed.

400
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:44,699
Oh!

401
00:48:44,733 --> 00:48:46,501
That's it. Bedtime.

402
00:49:07,056 --> 00:49:08,757
- Towel.
- Huh? Towl.

403
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,358
- Towel.
- Tow... Towel.

404
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:11,961
- Towel.
- Towel.

405
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:13,029
Tow-el.

406
00:49:13,062 --> 00:49:14,030
Towel?

407
00:49:14,063 --> 00:49:15,530
- Towel.
- Towel.

408
00:49:21,403 --> 00:49:22,871
Can you come up, please?

409
00:49:25,473 --> 00:49:26,541
Now?

410
00:49:26,575 --> 00:49:28,810
Yes. Yes, now, in a minute.

411
00:49:59,175 --> 00:50:02,377
Wh-What is that?

412
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,814
It's where they touch me.

413
00:50:07,183 --> 00:50:08,717
Where they touched you?

414
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:14,823
D-Does it hurt?

415
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:21,097
What did they do to you?

416
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:25,734
Tell me.

417
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,256
In his report,
Colonel Joll wrote

418
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:24,894
that one of the prisoners
died afterwards.

419
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:27,762
Do you remember that prisoner?

420
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:33,035
Do you know what they
did to him, who he was?

421
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:35,804
We heard he went crazy

422
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:36,871
and attacked them.

423
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:40,176
And?

424
00:51:43,245 --> 00:51:44,479
He attacked them.

425
00:51:46,781 --> 00:51:48,683
We had to take him out
afterwards.

426
00:51:49,718 --> 00:51:51,020
He was breathing strangely,

427
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:53,555
very deep and very fast.

428
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:56,858
Then he died the next day.

429
00:51:58,995 --> 00:52:01,730
He was the one they questioned
the longest, sir.

430
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:05,867
He had someone with him?

431
00:52:07,836 --> 00:52:08,904
His daughter.

432
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:14,877
His daughter.

433
00:52:17,213 --> 00:52:19,315
What happened to her?

434
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:20,883
She was questioned, too.

435
00:52:21,951 --> 00:52:23,252
I heard her crying.

436
00:52:24,652 --> 00:52:25,854
She was in pain.

437
00:52:27,756 --> 00:52:29,524
They broke her feet, I think.

438
00:52:31,593 --> 00:52:34,096
Did they do that
in... in front of him,

439
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,764
in front of her father?

440
00:52:35,797 --> 00:52:37,166
Yes, sir.

441
00:52:40,036 --> 00:52:42,804
They did something
to her eyes, didn't they?

442
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:47,043
Sir, there were a lot
of prisoners to take care of.

443
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,779
I-I know she had
a bad time with her feet,

444
00:52:50,812 --> 00:52:52,281
but the eyes...

445
00:52:53,815 --> 00:52:55,717
we didn't know about that
'til later.

446
00:53:04,026 --> 00:53:05,294
You should have told me.

447
00:53:08,663 --> 00:53:10,533
You should tell me everything.

448
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:28,210
And this...

449
00:54:37,887 --> 00:54:39,155
It was a fork.

450
00:54:40,456 --> 00:54:42,057
Kind of fork.

451
00:54:45,094 --> 00:54:49,965
They put it in a fire
until it was hot.

452
00:54:53,402 --> 00:54:55,504
Then they touch me with it.

453
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:01,210
They held my eyes open.

454
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:07,883
They said they'd
burn my eyes out.

455
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:12,955
After that,
I could not see anymore.

456
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:17,426
I can see
around the edges, yes...

457
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:21,096
but not in middle.

458
00:55:22,864 --> 00:55:24,166
There is blur.

459
00:55:49,491 --> 00:55:51,759
What do you feel

460
00:55:51,793 --> 00:55:54,129
towards the men
who did this to you?

461
00:56:00,002 --> 00:56:02,204
I'm tired of talking.

462
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:41,944
You aren't happy
with me here, are you?

463
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:58,826
You only have to say the word,
and I will take you back.

464
00:57:00,129 --> 00:57:01,530
Is that what you want?

465
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:09,938
I can't promise to take you
back to your family.

466
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:11,806
I don't know where they are.

467
00:57:13,609 --> 00:57:15,843
Do you want me to take you back?

468
00:57:37,366 --> 00:57:38,300
Ready?

469
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:41,303
Yes, sir.

470
00:57:43,339 --> 00:57:44,573
What are we waiting for, then?

471
00:57:47,343 --> 00:57:49,211
The girl is coming along.

472
00:57:49,244 --> 00:57:50,612
Was that your question?

473
00:57:50,646 --> 00:57:52,981
Yes, sir.

474
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:54,550
We'll be gone
no more than a week,

475
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:56,318
10 days at most.

476
01:00:35,344 --> 01:00:37,112
Thank you.

477
01:00:39,615 --> 01:00:41,216
Yeah.

478
01:02:09,237 --> 01:02:11,239
Bring in the horses! Quickly!

479
01:02:22,751 --> 01:02:24,553
That's a horse there!

480
01:04:04,853 --> 01:04:05,787
Here.

481
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:30,880
How much longer
before we...

482
01:04:32,781 --> 01:04:34,984
Before we find
what we're looking for?

483
01:04:39,654 --> 01:04:40,689
Tomorrow?

484
01:04:42,491 --> 01:04:44,292
The next day perhaps.

485
01:04:47,662 --> 01:04:49,531
Don't you know these parts, sir?

486
01:04:52,068 --> 01:04:53,903
No, I've not been here before...

487
01:04:56,505 --> 01:04:57,639
not this far.

488
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,627
Sir.

489
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:55,363
There's people ahead.

490
01:06:00,036 --> 01:06:00,970
Come.

491
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:21,023
There's no sign of them!

492
01:06:21,057 --> 01:06:22,724
They've gone, sir!

493
01:06:22,757 --> 01:06:24,860
No tracks?!

494
01:06:25,928 --> 01:06:26,862
Nothing.

495
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:25,087
Come on.

496
01:07:26,188 --> 01:07:27,622
Whoa, whoa.

497
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:38,000
Come... Come forward slowly.

498
01:07:38,034 --> 01:07:39,534
Then take my horse.

499
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:45,573
Wait. Wait. Wait.
No. No, no, no, no.

500
01:07:47,676 --> 01:07:48,643
All right.

501
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:51,914
Fetch the crutches.

502
01:07:54,516 --> 01:07:56,751
Come down off here.

503
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:57,719
Right.

504
01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:06,494
Help her. Help her.

505
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:11,633
They're here in front of us.

506
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:13,735
Wait here. Wait here.

507
01:08:34,723 --> 01:08:37,226
You must speak with them.

508
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:39,128
Tell them why we're here.

509
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:40,262
Tell them your story.

510
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:43,132
I want you
to tell them the truth.

511
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:48,603
You really want me to tell them?

512
01:08:52,707 --> 01:08:53,675
Well...

513
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:56,745
tell them what you like.

514
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:01,616
I have now done
what I said I would do.

515
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:05,021
Let me say what I...

516
01:09:07,789 --> 01:09:08,958
what I want.

517
01:09:09,992 --> 01:09:12,028
What I want from my heart...

518
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:17,532
is for you to come
to return to the town with me.

519
01:09:21,037 --> 01:09:22,670
Of your own choice.

520
01:09:23,772 --> 01:09:25,840
I want you to come back with me.

521
01:09:28,643 --> 01:09:30,279
You understand?

522
01:09:30,312 --> 01:09:32,181
This... This is what I want.

523
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:35,717
Why?

524
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:45,327
No.

525
01:09:45,361 --> 01:09:49,798
Do not want
go back to that place.

526
01:10:12,687 --> 01:10:13,655
I have...

527
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:17,625
I have... I have brought some...

528
01:10:17,659 --> 01:10:21,696
gifts that I would
like you to have.

529
01:10:33,075 --> 01:10:36,879
Ask them if we may buy
one of their horses.

530
01:10:36,912 --> 01:10:38,713
Say I will pay in silver.

531
01:11:48,951 --> 01:11:54,290
Silver is the... for horse he
does not take away from you.

532
01:11:54,323 --> 01:11:58,360
He does not take away my horse.

533
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:01,997
He take silver instead.

534
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:52,634
Where are you taking me?

535
01:14:52,668 --> 01:14:53,602
Go!

536
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:22,297
Why have I been kept waiting?

537
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:25,901
What have you done with my men?

538
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:29,338
Is there anything
I can help you with?

539
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:37,312
May I speak with Colonel Joll?

540
01:15:39,581 --> 01:15:41,283
Where have you been?

541
01:15:41,316 --> 01:15:43,685
I've been on a journey.

542
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:47,222
It pains me that I was not here
when you arrived

543
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:49,391
to offer you hospitality.

544
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:52,161
You've been treasonously
consorting with the enemy.

545
01:15:53,996 --> 01:15:55,030
Do you deny it?

546
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:59,201
We have no enemy
that I know of,

547
01:15:59,234 --> 01:16:01,503
unless we ourselves
are the enemy.

548
01:16:03,672 --> 01:16:06,175
Who gave you permission
to leave your post?

549
01:16:09,278 --> 01:16:11,013
That is a private matter.

550
01:16:11,046 --> 01:16:13,015
You will have to take
my word for it.

551
01:16:13,048 --> 01:16:16,251
I do not intend to discuss it.

552
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:18,620
I would like to speak
with Colonel Joll.

553
01:16:18,654 --> 01:16:20,556
Colonel Joll's not here.

554
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:25,060
Colonel Joll is out
conducting operations

555
01:16:25,093 --> 01:16:27,729
to correct the situation
that you've allowed to develop.

556
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:29,398
Fine.

557
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:30,766
Magistrate!

558
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:33,135
I'd like to read to you

559
01:16:33,168 --> 01:16:36,305
from some of the depositions
I have gathered

560
01:16:36,338 --> 01:16:38,373
since I arrived in this town...

561
01:16:40,275 --> 01:16:41,577
so you have some idea

562
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:44,112
of the gravity
of the charges against you.

563
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:49,051
I quote.

564
01:16:50,385 --> 01:16:53,755
"His conduct in office
left much to be desired,

565
01:16:53,789 --> 01:16:57,059
his decisions characterized
by arbitrariness,

566
01:16:57,092 --> 01:16:59,094
and he maintained
no regular system

567
01:16:59,127 --> 01:17:02,164
of accounting for monies."
Unquote.

568
01:17:03,298 --> 01:17:04,566
Inspection of your accounts

569
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,703
revealed many irregularities.

570
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:15,177
"Despite being
principal administrator,

571
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:17,679
he started a liaison
with a street woman

572
01:17:17,713 --> 01:17:19,715
patronized
by the common soldiers."

573
01:17:20,849 --> 01:17:22,518
Unquote.

574
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:24,620
A figure in obscene jokes.

575
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:31,627
Let me read to you
from one more.

576
01:17:35,264 --> 01:17:36,798
"On the first of March,

577
01:17:36,832 --> 01:17:39,768
I was given orders
to prepare for a journey

578
01:17:39,801 --> 01:17:42,170
into barbarian territory.

579
01:17:43,639 --> 01:17:47,309
Not until we set off
was I told

580
01:17:47,342 --> 01:17:51,413
that a young barbarian woman
would be accompanying us.

581
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,852
And at no point was I warned

582
01:17:56,886 --> 01:18:01,790
that we would be making contact
with the barbarians...

583
01:18:03,325 --> 01:18:04,760
and negotiating with them."

584
01:18:09,565 --> 01:18:11,800
Have you any idea
how bad it looks

585
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,135
when we have to come

586
01:18:13,168 --> 01:18:15,103
and clean up
the local administrations?

587
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:17,839
It isn't even our job.

588
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:21,276
I will defend myself
in a proper court of law.

589
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:22,578
Will you?

590
01:18:22,611 --> 01:18:26,181
No one would dare
say those things to my face.

591
01:18:26,214 --> 01:18:28,283
Who is responsible
for the claim

592
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:32,120
a-about the so-called
street woman?

593
01:18:32,154 --> 01:18:33,288
Let me see...

594
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:42,731
Is that all? I would like...

595
01:18:42,764 --> 01:18:43,799
I would like to wash.

596
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,736
I hope that you
will allow me to wash!

597
01:20:59,969 --> 01:21:01,503
Kneel.

598
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:04,306
Get on your knees.

599
01:22:08,804 --> 01:22:11,606
- Beat them!
- Come on! Beat the animals!

600
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,841
Beat the animals!

601
01:22:15,677 --> 01:22:16,611
Beat him!

602
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:29,791
That's the way.

603
01:22:47,143 --> 01:22:48,343
No.

604
01:22:49,811 --> 01:22:51,413
No!

605
01:22:51,446 --> 01:22:54,382
No! No! No! No!

606
01:22:54,416 --> 01:22:58,054
You! You are
depraving these people!

607
01:22:58,087 --> 01:22:59,387
You...

608
01:23:01,157 --> 01:23:02,657
No!

609
01:23:04,759 --> 01:23:05,928
No! No!

610
01:23:05,962 --> 01:23:06,996
Wait! Wait!

611
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:08,130
You broke...

612
01:23:08,164 --> 01:23:09,531
Wait! Wait. Wait.

613
01:23:10,565 --> 01:23:11,833
You've broken my arm.

614
01:23:15,137 --> 01:23:16,072
Just wait.

615
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:20,910
No, not with that,
not with that hammer.

616
01:23:20,943 --> 01:23:22,912
You would not use
a hammer on a beast.

617
01:23:22,945 --> 01:23:25,081
Look. These are men!

618
01:23:25,114 --> 01:23:26,448
Men!

619
01:24:50,632 --> 01:24:54,003
Among the items
found in your apartment

620
01:24:54,036 --> 01:24:56,705
was this wooden chest.

621
01:24:56,738 --> 01:24:58,640
Its contents are unusual.

622
01:25:00,176 --> 01:25:05,613
It contains approximately
300 slips of white poplar wood.

623
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:08,250
The surfaces are written on

624
01:25:08,284 --> 01:25:10,920
in an unfamiliar script.

625
01:25:10,953 --> 01:25:14,723
Now, a reasonable inference

626
01:25:14,756 --> 01:25:17,226
is that these slips
contain messages

627
01:25:17,259 --> 01:25:19,962
passed between yourself
and other parties.

628
01:25:21,263 --> 01:25:24,100
It remains for you to explain

629
01:25:24,133 --> 01:25:27,869
from whom are the messages,

630
01:25:27,903 --> 01:25:30,805
to whom are the messages.

631
01:25:31,974 --> 01:25:32,908
Permit me.

632
01:25:43,152 --> 01:25:47,522
I am sorry
I have to send bad news.

633
01:25:49,892 --> 01:25:54,596
The soldiers came
and took your brother away.

634
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:57,066
I have been to the fort
every day

635
01:25:57,099 --> 01:26:00,036
to plead for his return.

636
01:26:02,338 --> 01:26:06,275
Yesterday, they sent out
a man to speak with me.

637
01:26:06,308 --> 01:26:09,278
He says your brother
is no longer here.

638
01:26:09,311 --> 01:26:11,679
He says he has been ta...

639
01:26:13,349 --> 01:26:15,084
he has been taken away.

640
01:26:16,952 --> 01:26:19,055
Do not tell your mother,

641
01:26:19,088 --> 01:26:22,224
but join me in praying for him.

642
01:26:22,258 --> 01:26:26,062
Now, let... let's see...

643
01:26:26,095 --> 01:26:29,065
what this one says.

644
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,271
Um, I went to fetch your...

645
01:26:35,304 --> 01:26:38,573
Ah. I went to fetch
your brother.

646
01:26:39,874 --> 01:26:44,180
They showed me into a room
where he lay

647
01:26:44,213 --> 01:26:47,183
sewn up in a sheet.

648
01:26:47,216 --> 01:26:48,984
He...

649
01:26:49,018 --> 01:26:53,655
Th-There were bruises
all over his body,

650
01:26:53,688 --> 01:26:57,625
and his feet were broken
and swollen.

651
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:03,232
"What's happened to him?"
I asked the soldier.

652
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:05,667
"I don't know," he said.

653
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:23,319
As you see,
it contains a single character.

654
01:27:23,352 --> 01:27:25,820
It is the...
It is the character...

655
01:27:25,854 --> 01:27:29,091
barbarian character for "war."

656
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:33,162
Although it can also stand
for "vengeance,"

657
01:27:33,195 --> 01:27:38,234
and if... if you turn it
upside down like this,

658
01:27:38,267 --> 01:27:39,801
it can mean...

659
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:42,104
"justice."

660
01:27:44,173 --> 01:27:48,010
There's no way of knowing
in what sense it is intended.

661
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:52,214
That is a part
of barbarian c-cunning.

662
01:27:53,781 --> 01:27:56,418
It's the same
with the rest of these.

663
01:27:56,452 --> 01:27:59,821
Slips, they can be read
in many ways.

664
01:27:59,854 --> 01:28:02,424
They can be read
as a plan of war,

665
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:09,031
or they can read as a history
of the last years of the Empire.

666
01:28:09,064 --> 01:28:10,966
There's no knowing.

667
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,101
Thank you.

668
01:28:20,376 --> 01:28:22,144
I'm finished.

669
01:28:24,746 --> 01:28:29,418
You have no idea how tiresome
your behavior is.

670
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:32,054
You are the only official
on the frontier

671
01:28:32,087 --> 01:28:35,324
from whom we have not had
the fullest cooperation.

672
01:28:37,059 --> 01:28:38,494
When I arrived back,

673
01:28:38,527 --> 01:28:42,965
I had decided that as soon
as I had the answers from you

674
01:28:42,998 --> 01:28:44,967
to a simple few questions...

675
01:28:46,302 --> 01:28:49,238
you would be free
to go back to your old life

676
01:28:49,271 --> 01:28:51,773
and your concubines.

677
01:28:54,176 --> 01:28:58,214
However, you seem
to have a new ambition.

678
01:28:59,949 --> 01:29:02,484
You want to make
a name for yourself

679
01:29:02,518 --> 01:29:05,154
as the one just man.

680
01:29:05,187 --> 01:29:07,990
You are simply a clown.

681
01:29:08,023 --> 01:29:10,292
You are dirty.

682
01:29:10,326 --> 01:29:12,294
You stink.

683
01:29:12,328 --> 01:29:14,829
They can smell you a mile away.

684
01:29:16,232 --> 01:29:19,101
You want to get your name
into the history books,

685
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:20,336
history.

686
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:23,939
This is the border.

687
01:29:23,973 --> 01:29:26,242
This is nowhere.

688
01:29:26,275 --> 01:29:27,842
There is no history here.

689
01:29:30,546 --> 01:29:32,314
People are not interested

690
01:29:32,348 --> 01:29:36,485
in the history
of the back of beyond.

691
01:29:36,518 --> 01:29:38,087
We will end these troubles,

692
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,022
we will put down the enemy,

693
01:29:40,055 --> 01:29:42,191
and that will be the end of it.

694
01:29:42,224 --> 01:29:43,292
The enemy?

695
01:29:45,027 --> 01:29:48,163
These pitiable creatures
of yours,

696
01:29:48,197 --> 01:29:51,500
are they the enemy
that I must fear, Colonel?

697
01:29:51,533 --> 01:29:54,903
No, you... you are
the enemy, Colonel.

698
01:29:54,937 --> 01:29:56,171
Nonsense.

699
01:29:56,205 --> 01:29:58,907
You are an obscene torturer.

700
01:30:02,011 --> 01:30:05,281
You... You deserve to be hanged.

701
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:11,920
Now to business.

702
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:16,458
I would like
a statement from you

703
01:30:16,492 --> 01:30:19,395
on everything that passed
between you and the barbarians

704
01:30:19,428 --> 01:30:23,432
on your recent
and unauthorized visit.

705
01:30:29,338 --> 01:30:30,906
We are waiting.

706
01:30:46,221 --> 01:30:48,057
I refuse.

707
01:30:50,926 --> 01:30:52,394
You refuse?

708
01:30:54,997 --> 01:30:56,598
Very well.

709
01:30:56,632 --> 01:30:58,934
Then our interview is over.

710
01:31:01,337 --> 01:31:02,438
He is yours.

711
01:32:24,019 --> 01:32:25,053
Climb.

712
01:32:28,424 --> 01:32:29,358
Pull him up.

713
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:33,929
Climb.

714
01:32:38,434 --> 01:32:39,401
Climb.

715
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:51,680
And what do you
want to say to me?

716
01:32:51,713 --> 01:32:54,349
That... That nothing passed

717
01:32:54,383 --> 01:32:57,986
between the barbarians
and myself

718
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,489
of a military nature.

719
01:33:00,522 --> 01:33:03,058
It was a private affair.

720
01:33:03,091 --> 01:33:06,228
I returned the girl
to her people...

721
01:33:07,563 --> 01:33:08,697
nothing more.

722
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:05,521
No chance of going in
to my apartments

723
01:34:05,554 --> 01:34:07,389
just for a minute,

724
01:34:07,422 --> 01:34:09,391
get a few of my things?

725
01:34:12,694 --> 01:34:14,162
Sir, I can't.

726
01:34:16,265 --> 01:34:17,266
I really can't.

727
01:34:17,299 --> 01:34:18,567
It's fine.

728
01:34:21,803 --> 01:34:24,773
Colonel Joll
and his expeditionary force

729
01:34:24,806 --> 01:34:30,245
have been out in the desert
for a long time, haven't they?

730
01:34:30,279 --> 01:34:31,647
Since when?

731
01:34:33,315 --> 01:34:34,416
Since August, sir.

732
01:34:34,449 --> 01:34:35,717
August?

733
01:34:39,788 --> 01:34:41,623
You must be worried.

734
01:34:49,598 --> 01:34:54,536
Well, one mustn't take
the barbarians lightly.

735
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,169
Your... Your daughter's gone,

736
01:35:27,202 --> 01:35:29,605
leaving you with the boy?

737
01:35:29,638 --> 01:35:32,307
Ah, he's no trouble.

738
01:35:34,276 --> 01:35:37,746
So many people have left,

739
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:39,615
all my girls...

740
01:35:39,648 --> 01:35:41,583
your clerk, Naim.

741
01:35:42,618 --> 01:35:45,454
They took the east road.

742
01:35:45,487 --> 01:35:47,689
Just 'til it settles down,
they say.

743
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,435
My rooms are empty.

744
01:36:02,504 --> 01:36:04,806
But they won't let me in.

745
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:13,215
I'll find room for you.

746
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,622
You're an angel.

747
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:29,498
You're always somewhere else.

748
01:36:34,003 --> 01:36:36,238
She would say the same thing...

749
01:36:38,306 --> 01:36:40,208
your barbarian girl.

750
01:36:42,811 --> 01:36:44,881
She said you were
always somewhere else.

751
01:36:44,914 --> 01:36:47,349
She couldn't understand you.

752
01:36:47,382 --> 01:36:49,685
She didn't know
what you wanted from her.

753
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:58,460
I didn't know
the two of you were intimate.

754
01:36:58,493 --> 01:37:00,195
Oh, we talked.

755
01:37:01,596 --> 01:37:06,936
Sometimes she used to cry
and cry and cry.

756
01:37:10,505 --> 01:37:13,408
What bird
has the heart to sing...

757
01:37:14,643 --> 01:37:16,678
in a thicket of thorns?

758
01:37:18,647 --> 01:37:21,416
Oh, no, it wasn't
what they did to her.

759
01:37:22,651 --> 01:37:23,819
It was you.

760
01:37:25,587 --> 01:37:27,890
You made her very unhappy.

761
01:37:33,795 --> 01:37:35,363
Grandma.

762
01:37:36,865 --> 01:37:40,235
I-I did?

763
01:37:44,339 --> 01:37:45,741
Yeah, didn't you know that?

764
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:49,578
Grandma.

765
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:37,026
- Ah.
- Yeah.

766
01:38:37,059 --> 01:38:39,028
- Why not?
- That's what I said to him.

767
01:38:43,532 --> 01:38:44,766
Your move.

768
01:38:45,834 --> 01:38:46,835
- Drawing.
- Ah.

769
01:38:49,906 --> 01:38:51,007
So...

770
01:38:52,808 --> 01:38:54,409
Magistrate.

771
01:38:57,379 --> 01:38:59,681
You're growing fat again.

772
01:39:01,683 --> 01:39:03,552
What happened to your work?

773
01:39:08,723 --> 01:39:11,626
I am a prisoner awaiting trial.

774
01:39:13,829 --> 01:39:16,065
Prisoners awaiting trial

775
01:39:16,098 --> 01:39:18,968
are not required
to work for their feed.

776
01:39:22,171 --> 01:39:23,772
That is the law.

777
01:39:24,806 --> 01:39:27,109
We have no record of you.

778
01:39:27,143 --> 01:39:28,510
H-How could you be a prisoner?

779
01:39:28,543 --> 01:39:30,046
Do we have a record of this man?

780
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:31,914
No, sir, we don't.

781
01:39:33,182 --> 01:39:35,417
Then you must be a free man.

782
01:39:36,618 --> 01:39:37,920
The gates are open.

783
01:39:39,088 --> 01:39:40,856
Go on. Leave if you wish.

784
01:39:46,528 --> 01:39:48,030
Just... Just a minute.

785
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:56,005
There's something that I would
like to know before I leave.

786
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:01,509
Forgive me if the question
seems impudent.

787
01:40:02,744 --> 01:40:04,546
But I would like to ask...

788
01:40:08,117 --> 01:40:10,920
how do you eat afterwards?

789
01:40:13,122 --> 01:40:14,556
After you've been...

790
01:40:16,758 --> 01:40:18,860
working with people?

791
01:40:30,505 --> 01:40:31,773
I'm sincere.

792
01:40:34,043 --> 01:40:36,078
Do you...

793
01:40:36,112 --> 01:40:40,548
Do you find it easy
to take food afterwards?

794
01:40:40,582 --> 01:40:44,053
I would imagine
one wants to wash one's hands,

795
01:40:44,086 --> 01:40:45,854
to... to clean off the blood,

796
01:40:45,888 --> 01:40:48,190
but to sit with one's
family and friends,

797
01:40:48,224 --> 01:40:49,491
eat...

798
01:40:49,524 --> 01:40:51,127
Get out of here.

799
01:40:52,794 --> 01:40:55,064
Get out of here,
you fucking old lunatic.

800
01:40:55,097 --> 01:40:56,531
Get out!

801
01:40:57,967 --> 01:41:01,103
Go and die somewhere,
you fucking traitor.

802
01:42:08,037 --> 01:42:12,241
"This withdrawal will be
only a temporary measure.

803
01:42:13,943 --> 01:42:16,745
Caretaker force will remain

804
01:42:16,778 --> 01:42:19,882
which will be adequate
for all routine duties.

805
01:42:22,018 --> 01:42:24,853
Relevant orders are given
on imperial authority

806
01:42:24,887 --> 01:42:28,290
and are part of a general
scaling down of operations

807
01:42:28,324 --> 01:42:31,526
along the frontier
for the duration of the winter."

808
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:35,064
Thank you all...

809
01:42:36,698 --> 01:42:39,801
for your unforgettable
hospitality.

810
01:43:18,274 --> 01:43:19,909
Okay, let's go!

811
01:43:19,942 --> 01:43:21,676
That's the last of the grain!

812
01:43:27,183 --> 01:43:29,051
Bring her! Come on!

813
01:43:29,085 --> 01:43:30,652
This way!

814
01:43:30,685 --> 01:43:32,121
- Get back!
- Get in here.

815
01:43:32,154 --> 01:43:35,224
Get back, or I'll shoot!

816
01:43:35,257 --> 01:43:36,325
Hah! Hah!

817
01:43:41,696 --> 01:43:43,099
Get off!

818
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,122
Officer Mandel!

819
01:44:45,161 --> 01:44:46,295
Where is Officer Mandel?

820
01:44:47,363 --> 01:44:49,198
We must have fresh horses.

821
01:44:49,231 --> 01:44:50,966
Who needs horses?

822
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,269
The Colonel.
We... We need fresh horses.

823
01:44:54,802 --> 01:44:56,738
Is he here?

824
01:44:56,771 --> 01:44:58,908
We need fresh horses.

825
01:45:00,742 --> 01:45:03,179
There are no horses.

826
01:45:03,212 --> 01:45:04,846
There's nothing.

827
01:45:07,016 --> 01:45:08,450
Oh.

828
01:45:08,484 --> 01:45:10,386
- Ch-Check that way.
- Okay.

829
01:46:04,139 --> 01:46:05,207
We need to hurry, sir!

830
01:46:11,213 --> 01:46:13,182
Hah! Hah!

831
01:46:19,421 --> 01:46:20,356
Hah!

832
01:49:52,989 --> 01:49:57,989

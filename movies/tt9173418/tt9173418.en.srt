2
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:40,064
Jude?

3
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:45,067
Jude. I'm home.

4
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:55,848
Turn off the video games.

5
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,360
Jude.

6
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:11,497
Gotcha!

7
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,433
Shit!

8
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:19,936
Another prank?
Why do you have to keep doing this?

9
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:21,538
I got you good, didn't I?

10
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,105
You think
you're funny, huh?

11
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:25,107
Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Okay.

12
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:27,245
Saved by your dad.

13
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:30,112
- Hi.
- Dad.

14
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:31,882
<i>What's up, mate?</i>

15
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:33,950
<i>You being the big man of the
house and taking care of your mum?</i>

16
00:02:33,952 --> 00:02:35,752
More like scaring
his old mom.

17
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:37,353
I used the shoe trick.

18
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,623
<i>The shoe trick.
Now, let me see.</i>

19
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,592
<i>No, I think you must be mistaking
me with someone else, mate.</i>

20
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,694
Real sneaky, you two.

21
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:46,228
<i>I can't stay long, love.</i>

22
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,431
<i>I've gotta take some clients
out for dinner.</i>

23
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,867
<i>But I just wanted to check in
on my two favorite people,</i>

24
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:53,637
<i>and let you know that I miss you
both and I love you guys so much.</i>

25
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,237
- Love you, Dad.
- <i>Bye, kiddo.</i>

26
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:56,140
Later!

27
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:01,411
You know, it's the third time
this week you've been late.

28
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:03,245
<i>I know, I know.</i>

29
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:05,247
<i>I've just got to finish these
deadlines, then I'm done. I promise.</i>

30
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:06,917
<i>When I get back,</i>

31
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,085
<i>maybe I can find a way
to make it up to you.</i>

32
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:12,288
Well, Friday night,
we do have the nanny.

33
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,458
<i>Oh. Well, then I will see you
on Friday night, lady.</i>

34
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,327
If you're lucky.

35
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,932
- Night.
- <i>Good night, love.</i>

36
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,569
Were you really scared, Mom?

37
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,736
I was.

38
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:28,574
But next time,
let's get your dad.

39
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:31,577
Okay.

40
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,580
Looks like Mr. Brown
could use a cuddle.

41
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:38,915
- Mom.
- Hmm?

42
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,250
I'm too old to still sleep
with a teddy bear.

43
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:43,287
Well, I won't tell
if you won't.

44
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:45,323
Good night.

45
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,358
Good night, Mom.

46
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:34,238
Jude?

47
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:21,019
If you're trying to scare me
again, it's not funny.

48
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:24,956
Okay.

49
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,564
Mom!

50
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:35,967
What are you doing?

51
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:37,602
Mom, don't!

52
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,743
No! No!

53
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:47,646
Jude!

54
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:50,214
Jude!

55
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,194
Mommy!

56
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:23,247
I thought we could take a
look at some of those toys today.

57
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:28,787
Or perhaps there's something
you'd like to talk about?

58
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,261
You don't like coming here
very much, do you?

59
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,535
But you do understand
why you're here?

60
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,006
You know, Jude,
if you'd like to go,

61
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:52,444
all you need to do is to say,
"I'd like to go now."

62
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:05,822
Five months isn't an unusual time
for this kind of selective mutism.

63
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:08,458
I've seen children
stop talking for much longer

64
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,994
from much less severe trauma.

65
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:13,463
Encourage him to communicate,
but try not to force it.

66
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,297
It has to come from him.

67
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,736
The more we force things,
the more he's gonna pull back.

68
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:20,806
And how are the two of you
holding up?

69
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,073
We're good, yeah.

70
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:26,011
As well as we can be.

71
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,481
We're really just trying to focus
on Jude's recovery right now.

72
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,583
Well, I commend
your dedication.

73
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,752
But Jude is looking
to you now.

74
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:38,523
And if you're not getting
better, he won't get better.

75
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:42,661
Thank you.

76
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:04,449
Another headache?

77
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,421
It's not that bad.

78
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,897
I thought the doctor
had some good things to say.

79
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:21,233
Yeah.

80
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:26,204
I think Jude
is a little better.

81
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:29,741
No. I meant, actually,
about us healing too.

82
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,213
Well, I'm... fine, really.

83
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:37,883
You never leave the house.

84
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:41,253
You have nightmares
every night,

85
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:44,721
and you don't even
let me touch you.

86
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:48,258
I'm... not having
this conversation again.

87
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,794
We've never had
this conversation.

88
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:54,466
You've never talked about
what happened or how you feel.

89
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:59,569
What if we went away?

90
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:01,506
Out of the city,
someplace quiet.

91
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,575
You're already homeschooling Jude.
I can work wherever.

92
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:08,179
I think it would be a good chance
for us to have a fresh start.

93
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:16,488
I'll think about it.

94
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,430
What is it, sweetheart?

95
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:49,519
Liza!

96
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:50,820
Liza, be quiet!

97
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:51,821
Liza.

98
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:52,989
Liza.

99
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:54,691
Liza. Liza. It's okay.

100
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,397
It's okay. You're all right.

101
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,302
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

102
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,538
It's okay.

103
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:13,311
I can't do this anymore.

104
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:53,516
Hiya! I'm Pamela.

105
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,918
Oh, I'm glad you found it.

106
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,520
Shall I show you the house?

107
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,122
And what's
this little man's name?

108
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:00,556
Jude.

109
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:02,358
He's a little shy.

110
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,562
Oh, well,
I bet we'll be best of friends in no time.

111
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:09,265
This used to be a guesthouse
of a much larger property.

112
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,567
But after the owner of
the manor house passed away,

113
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:14,637
some city man, no offense,
came and scooped it up.

114
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,239
I think
he was gonna restore it,

115
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:18,375
but I imagine the job
got too much for him.

116
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,076
Lucky for you folks,
though.

117
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:21,310
Some time
in the countryside.

118
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,745
It's perfect.

119
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:24,247
I'll give you a little tour
if you like.

120
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:27,083
No. I think we can
handle it from here.

121
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,618
Oh. All right.

122
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,319
- Thank you.
- Take care.

123
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:31,723
Cheers. Bye-bye.

124
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:38,995
So, what do you think?

125
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:40,397
It's beautiful.

126
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,267
- Yeah? You sure?
- Yes.

127
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,438
And what about you,
big boss?

128
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:49,508
All right.

129
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:52,478
I vote we try a little...

130
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,448
nature exploration!

131
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:59,282
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah, it's so quiet.

132
00:11:59,284 --> 00:12:00,351
Look at the sun.

133
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,789
Smell the air.
That's fresh air.

134
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,124
I bet we'll see loads
of rabbits come spring.

135
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:10,195
- Maybe even some deer, huh?
- Yeah.

136
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,332
Watch your step, mate.
It's slippery.

137
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:22,972
What's that?

138
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:24,477
That must be
the main house.

139
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:27,645
Let's check it out.

140
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,897
Look at that.

141
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,366
Wow. Now, that is
what I call a house.

142
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:51,470
Come here.

143
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:55,071
Come on, Jude.

144
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,372
<i>Jude.</i>

145
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,342
Wow.

146
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:02,178
This place must've been quite
something back in the day.

147
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,248
"Glennview Estate."

148
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:07,318
<i>Jude, come play with us.</i>

149
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,055
<i>Jude.</i>

150
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:15,725
<i>Come here, Jude. Over here.</i>

151
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:17,193
<i>Jude.</i>

152
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:18,897
<i>Come over here.</i>

153
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,837
<i>Now, Jude.</i>

154
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:31,073
We'll have to look it up.

155
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:33,111
Old house like this probably
got some real history to it.

156
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:38,249
Sean.

157
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,356
<i>Jude, Jude. Help me, Jude.</i>

158
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:48,760
<i>Jude, Jude, Jude.</i>

159
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:53,097
<i>Yes, Jude.</i>

160
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,080
Yeah, forget the guesthouse.

161
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:12,482
I'm moving in here.

162
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,718
What do you say, Jude?

163
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,454
Jude?

164
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,290
- Jude!
- Jude?

165
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,292
Jude!

166
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:24,561
Mate, don't run off
like that, please.

167
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,798
You can't run off like that,
not out here.

168
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,499
What's that?

169
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,669
Did you just find that?

170
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,904
Can I take a look?

171
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:37,409
Oh, my goodness.
It's filthy. Look at it.

172
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:39,944
Whereabouts
did you find it?

173
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,617
Do you wanna keep it?

174
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,819
Okay. Let's get it
cleaned up first.

175
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:52,757
All right. Can't wait to have
this guy in the house.

176
00:15:15,947 --> 00:15:16,848
Can I see?

177
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:20,985
"Rules."

178
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:23,855
Huh.

179
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,130
I bet you have
a story to tell.

180
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,036
Looks like
he wants a friend.

181
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,158
He looks like
he was broken before...

182
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:05,863
and put back together again.

183
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,005
Okay, let's go to bed now.
Hmm?

184
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,574
Come on, mate.

185
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,576
You sure you got everything you need
there, little fella? Yeah?

186
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,678
You just make yourself at home.
Put your feet up.

187
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,348
There's nice, cold beer
in the fridge.

188
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:25,716
I could use
some of those pj's.

189
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,156
You dressed him yourself.

190
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,864
That sounds lovely.

191
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:50,869
Are you hungry?

192
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:53,304
Okay.

193
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,709
I'll make pancakes.

194
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:13,824
I guess it's about time for me
to start my morning commute,

195
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,159
all the way down the hallway.

196
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,361
I really hope
there's no traffic, guys.

197
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:22,466
You wanna stop by the office
for lunch today?

198
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,735
Did I mention that I was
just down the hallway?

199
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,303
I'll try to sneak by.

200
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:28,874
Goodbye, Judester.
Mwah.

201
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,477
And goodbye, uh...

202
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,245
Did we come up
with a name for him yet?

203
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,753
"Brahms." Wow.

204
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,188
Like the composer?

205
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,092
That's quite the name.
How'd you come up with that?

206
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,668
Oh, he told you.
Right, yeah.

207
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,338
Well, of course, he did.
Silly me.

208
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,542
All right. Bye, gang.

209
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,343
Goodbye, Brahms.

210
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,445
Well, what should we
start with today,

211
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,882
math or history?

212
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,591
Okay.

213
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,933
<i>Over here.</i>

214
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,202
Wait up!

215
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:34,940
<i>Right here.</i>

216
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,277
<i>This way.</i>

217
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,753
Jude!

218
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,123
I told you not
to run off like that.

219
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,562
This is where you found him?

220
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,234
Oz, get in here.

221
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,404
This is private property.

222
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,271
I'm sorry. We're staying
at the guesthouse.

223
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:10,941
We were just on a walk.
I didn't know.

224
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,842
Of course you didn't.
You're the new family.

225
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,414
Sorry, I get a lot of people
snooping around up here.

226
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,514
I'm Joseph. Joe.

227
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,349
Um, I tend the grounds
around here.

228
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,521
Part guard, part gardener. This is Oz.

229
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:24,454
I'm Liza.

230
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,188
And this is Jude.

231
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:34,433
We can put the doll back.

232
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,298
Do you want us...

233
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,636
No, no, no, no.

234
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,038
Keep it. No one's
gonna miss it out here.

235
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,007
Just me and Oz these days.

236
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,644
Unless, of course,
you'd like to put it back?

237
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,546
He's a little quiet.

238
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,618
Don't worry about that.
Not much of a talker meself.

239
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:56,185
People think I'm crazy
for living out here on my own,

240
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:58,187
but I'm more sane
than any of them.

241
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:01,323
The real crazies are living in the city,
packed together like a bunch of cattle.

242
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:03,026
Thank you,
but no, thank you.

243
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,729
You didn't really have to
walk us all the way back.

244
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,697
Ah, I don't mind.
We're neighbors now.

245
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,566
I suppose I'll be seeing
quite a bit of you.

246
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,734
Hey there.

247
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,335
That's a healthy-looking
12 gauge.

248
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:14,305
Or a 12 bore.

249
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,874
I was worried about you.

250
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,341
This is Joseph.

251
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:21,378
Joseph, this is
my husband, Sean.

252
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,979
- Hiya.
- Joseph...

253
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,214
I tend the grounds round here.
Keep the troublemakers out.

254
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:26,916
Caught these two red-handed.

255
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,319
Yeah, these two are trouble,
all right.

256
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:30,689
Well, thanks
for escorting them back.

257
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:35,727
Right. I'll be off, then.
Let me know if you need anything, yeah?

258
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,595
Yeah. Nice meeting you.

259
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,831
Pleasure was all mine.

260
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:42,601
See you soon, little fella.

261
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,872
Bringing home the local strays
already, huh?

262
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,274
He's right there.

263
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:04,056
Look, he insisted on
walking us all the way home.

264
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,288
Come on, Oz. Come on.

265
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,626
Nice of him, I guess.

266
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:11,895
Who the hell buries a doll
in the woods like that?

267
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,863
Maybe some weird little kid
put it there.

268
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,197
I don't know, sweetheart.

269
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,400
Yeah, but you weren't there.
You didn't see it.

270
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,805
His entire wardrobe,
in this...

271
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,706
coffin thing.

272
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,910
Okay.
So, what do you wanna do?

273
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:29,614
- You wanna take the doll away from him?
- Yes.

274
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:32,249
No.

275
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,886
I don't know.

276
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:39,254
I just think
it's all a little bit...

277
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:40,257
creepy.

278
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:44,261
I really don't think it's the
doll that's the problem here.

279
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,296
What does that mean?

280
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:49,264
Nothing. Let's just
finish the dishes, yeah?

281
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:50,736
I've got some work to do
before we go to sleep.

282
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,272
No, I wanna hear
what you were about to say.

283
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:57,909
What's the problem?

284
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:04,649
Sometimes I feel like
you use Jude...

285
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:09,953
to avoid talking about
what happened to you.

286
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,124
And I don't think that's
healthy for either of you.

287
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,932
<i>Mommy!</i>

288
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,469
You know, I nearly died...

289
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,473
in some random,
senseless burglary.

290
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,008
And I'm actually aware of that
every single day of my life.

291
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,943
Yes, but that's over now.

292
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,180
Li...

293
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,853
Dogs bark.
You didn't like the dog?

294
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,989
The dog.

295
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:47,025
Dogs bark.

296
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,860
I know what you mean.
He was kind of scary.

297
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:51,895
Liza, I'm sorry.

298
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:53,131
Shh, shh, shh.

299
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,372
Holy shit.

300
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,542
Should we just leave him alone?
Do you wanna open the door?

301
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,510
No, I wanna go in. I wanna
see if he'll talk to us.

302
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,647
Okay. Let's go.

303
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,082
So, all this is yours?

304
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,883
Hey, sweetheart.

305
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:17,189
We were just outside,
and we thought we heard you talking.

306
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,391
Were you talking
to Brahms?

307
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,059
Great.

308
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,429
So, what were you guys
talking about?

309
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,872
The dog from this morning.

310
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:36,741
Did he scare you?

311
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,017
"Brahms doesn't like him."

312
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:48,920
Oh.

313
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,723
Well, that's...

314
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:53,925
that's great.

315
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,129
We'll let you get back
to Brahms.

316
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,565
Good night.

317
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,871
Thinking about watching a
movie, if you're interested.

318
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,244
Oh, yeah.

319
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:13,712
Sure.

320
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,419
I guess we're
keeping that doll.

321
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,755
Are you kidding? I love that creepy thing.

322
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,834
Liza, it's okay.
Honey, it's okay. Look at me.

323
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,068
It was just a dream.

324
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,303
Look at me.
It's fine. You're okay.

325
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,706
Jude.

326
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,809
Jude, I'm sorry.

327
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,744
He's mine!

328
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,014
You okay?
Another nightmare?

329
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,548
Where's Jude?

330
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,884
He slept in his room,
love.

331
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,497
This is the first time
he's slept in his own bed.

332
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,200
Come on.

333
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,336
Let's go back to bed.

334
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,024
Here you go.
Do you want two, yeah?

335
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,594
Does Brahms want two?

336
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,295
Hey, good morning.
You're up.

337
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,064
I let you lie in.

338
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,768
It seemed like
you could use it.

339
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,371
Thank you.

340
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,307
Cooked up
a little Full English.

341
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,243
Here you go, love.

342
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,079
- What's this?
- Oh, that. Yes.

343
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:07,216
Well, apparently, Brahms
is handing down rules now,

344
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,120
including
he'd like his own food.

345
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,464
"Always and forever"?

346
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,472
Oh, dear.

347
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:02,974
What happened
to Mr. Brown?

348
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:07,946
Jude, buddy,

349
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:09,781
did you do this?

350
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:13,716
Come on, mate.

351
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,785
It's not very nice
to blame him now, is it?

352
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,621
Look, we're not mad at you.

353
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,892
But this is no way
to treat your things.

354
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,827
And it's never okay to lie.

355
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,165
So, did you cut up
Mr. Brown?

356
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:34,505
Okay. Then why don't you go to your
room and finish your homework there?

357
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,509
And then when you're ready to tell
me what happened, you can come out.

358
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,654
You can leave
the doll here.

359
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,422
Jude.

360
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:53,858
You heard your mum.
Leave the doll, please.

361
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,074
Maybe it's a good thing.
He's getting his anger out.

362
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,415
It's pretty violent.

363
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,652
Really?

364
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,291
That wasn't funny.

365
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,293
You're supposed
to stay in this room

366
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,797
and not come out again until
you're ready to apologize.

367
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,875
Fine. You can stay in here
for the rest of the day, then.

368
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:32,418
Aaah!

369
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,857
Jude,

370
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,762
your father and I
said no doll.

371
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,933
Okay, I am gonna count to three,
and if this door isn't open...

372
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,367
One...

373
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,736
two...

374
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:26,638
three.

375
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,814
What are you doing here?

376
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,510
Hey.

377
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,146
I have someone here
who wants to apologize.

378
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:10,816
Come on.

379
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,185
Hey.

380
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,801
Thank you for apologizing.

381
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:37,707
Okay. Let's get you
to bed, yeah?

382
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,143
Go brush your teeth.
Good boy.

383
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,784
You okay?

384
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,855
Not good.

385
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,857
I could've sworn I saw somebody
go into his room, and then...

386
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,459
You didn't. It's fine.

387
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:56,895
Honestly, his pranks
are getting out of hand.

388
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,129
Yeah, but I thought
everything would be better

389
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,668
once we got out of the city.

390
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,706
I don't know what to do.

391
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:12,009
I just feel like
I'm letting you and Jude down.

392
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,811
You're not
letting anyone down.

393
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,213
Please don't be sorry.

394
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,515
You'll feel better
after some sleep.

395
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:19,518
Yeah.

396
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,384
Good night.

397
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:22,486
All right.

398
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:47,243
<i>I understand that some of Jude's
recent behaviors would be upsetting.</i>

399
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:53,015
<i>But the doll clearly is providing him
with a safe outlet to process his trauma.</i>

400
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:56,419
<i>Now comes the hard part,
where he might try to act out some more.</i>

401
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,721
Act out?

402
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,255
Listen, what if we just
got rid of the doll?

403
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,857
How bad would that be?

404
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,291
<i>I urge you to be patient</i>

405
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,895
<i>and allow him
to have his friend.</i>

406
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:07,964
<i>He's found a place with this
doll where he feels safe.</i>

407
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:11,066
<i>And the last thing we want
to do is take that away.</i>

408
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,637
<i>I'll send you some links
with further information.</i>

409
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,572
Okay. Sounds good.

410
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,273
Thanks, doc. We'll speak
to you soon, yeah?

411
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,408
<i>Okay. Take care.</i>

412
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,380
Perfect.

413
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:25,551
There you go. Nice.

414
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:29,821
Come on, Jude.

415
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,590
That's it. Once.
Then move it on.

416
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,493
Perfect.

417
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,267
Hello, Jude.

418
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:20,606
What you got there?

419
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,640
Okay.

420
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:24,977
You thought of a name
for him yet?

421
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,013
What is it?

422
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:39,456
Course it is.

423
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,894
Because that's his name, isn't it?
What else would it be?

424
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,899
You've scrubbed up well,
little man.

425
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,572
So, I see you've found
yourself a new family.

426
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:05,050
How're you doing,
little fella?

427
00:38:11,657 --> 00:38:14,024
Just look at that expression
on his face.

428
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:17,496
It's like he's got a secret
that only he knows.

429
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,500
Do you ever notice that?

430
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:25,869
Can I help you?

431
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:27,070
Hello there.

432
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,205
I was just looking for Oz,
my daft dog.

433
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,675
We haven't seen him.

434
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,175
All right, never mind.

435
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,746
Pretty good idea
where he'll be, anyway.

436
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,682
Right, I'll be off.

437
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:38,784
You be good now.

438
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:45,090
Come on.
It's time to go inside.

439
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,703
You left Jude
outside all alone?

440
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:01,272
I just left him for a second.

441
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,316
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

442
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:55,587
I just saw it.
It was just there.

443
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:58,555
- I'm sorry.
- My God, Liza.

444
00:40:58,557 --> 00:40:59,257
What are you doing?

445
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,187
Jude?

446
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,988
"I'll always be with you"?

447
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,058
"They will be sorry."

448
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:23,675
Sorry.

449
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,945
I didn't know
you were standing there.

450
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,317
Why are you wearing that?

451
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:38,456
Dinner's in 15.

452
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:11,056
No. It's just the three of us
for dinner tonight, Jude.

453
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:14,991
No, not tonight.

454
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:16,661
Does it really matter,
Liza?

455
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,038
Your mum said no, mate.

456
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,312
So, I was thinking of inviting Liam
out, and the family.

457
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,681
Felt like maybe
we could use some company.

458
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:42,585
No? You wanna see your Uncle Liam,
Auntie Mary and your cousins?

459
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:45,822
I think it'll be fun.
He's always a good laugh, isn't he?

460
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:47,359
I think he'd love
to get out of the city.

461
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:50,927
Not really guests.

462
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:52,195
They're family.

463
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:53,863
Yeah?

464
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:56,001
Your dad and I make the rules
in this house, not your doll.

465
00:44:02,374 --> 00:44:04,109
Mm-mmm. Eat it.

466
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:06,876
All right, come on.
Enough.

467
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,445
No, it's fine.

468
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:10,915
You can sit here until you
decide you can eat your food.

469
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,687
Just do as your mum says,
please.

470
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:26,362
Look, I can handle this.

471
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,933
It's okay.
It's fine. You have work to do.

472
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:49,455
Well, if you won't talk to
me, will the doll?

473
00:44:51,457 --> 00:44:54,759
That's because Brahms
is not a person.

474
00:44:57,095 --> 00:44:58,895
He's not real.

475
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:01,733
He doesn't need any food.
You do.

476
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:11,910
The doll and his rules
do not run this house.

477
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:27,192
Fine.
Stay here all night, then.

478
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:58,957
What?

479
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:02,992
Jude.

480
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:03,895
Jude.

481
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:07,298
Liza, what in the hell
happened?

482
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:22,579
Look, I believe you,
I do.

483
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:24,381
It's just...

484
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:28,184
So, some scary drawings.

485
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:30,688
It's not really surprising, is it?
Considering what he's been through.

486
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,656
The drawing of the dog.

487
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:34,692
The dog?

488
00:46:35,394 --> 00:46:36,593
There is no dog here.

489
00:46:36,595 --> 00:46:39,162
There was one. And others.

490
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:42,599
Sean, there was a drawing of Jude
standing over our dead bodies

491
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:44,700
and he was holding a gun.

492
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,839
So you're saying he ripped
pages out of his book?

493
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:50,041
No, I...

494
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:52,875
I don't know what happened.

495
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:56,212
I just know that I want
that doll out of our house.

496
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:59,182
Look, you need to slow down.
I need to think about this.

497
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:01,385
No, I don't want it here.

498
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:03,855
I don't like
what it's doing to Jude.

499
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:07,692
What?

500
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:10,529
I mean, all of this.

501
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:14,197
This is a lot for a little
kid, don't you think?

502
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,367
This isn't a light table,
for starters.

503
00:47:17,536 --> 00:47:19,403
Are you asking me
if I did this?

504
00:47:19,405 --> 00:47:21,938
Somebody's done this.
You're the only person in here with him.

505
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,576
No! Something
is happening to him.

506
00:47:25,578 --> 00:47:28,110
And it started with that doll.

507
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:30,782
Fine. We'll get rid of
the doll in the morning, okay?

508
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:34,752
What are we gonna
do about them, Brahms?

509
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:40,559
Oz! Where are you, boy?

510
00:47:51,437 --> 00:47:54,172
Come here, Oz. Come here, boy.

511
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:10,656
Oh, Oz.

512
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:24,603
Lovely. I need that.
Thank you.

513
00:48:25,504 --> 00:48:26,503
Ready?

514
00:48:26,505 --> 00:48:28,306
Yeah. Let's do it.

515
00:48:31,677 --> 00:48:32,944
Morning, mister.

516
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:35,947
No.

517
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,020
Sean.

518
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:46,157
Jude!

519
00:48:47,158 --> 00:48:48,224
Come on, buddy!

520
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:49,728
It's not funny, Jude!

521
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,497
I'll go this way.

522
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:56,165
- You head off that way.
- Okay.

523
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,503
We'll circle round.
We'll meet back at the house.

524
00:48:58,504 --> 00:48:59,638
Jude!

525
00:49:00,673 --> 00:49:02,171
Jude!

526
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:03,374
Jude!

527
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:15,113
Jude?

528
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,240
Jude?

529
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:46,678
Jude.

530
00:50:55,788 --> 00:50:56,755
Jude?

531
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:03,827
Jude? Is that you?

532
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:05,363
Jude, what are you doing?

533
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,971
Jude, where are you?

534
00:51:25,684 --> 00:51:26,951
Look, Mommy.

535
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,888
Over here.

536
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,025
Come play with us, Mommy.

537
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:35,587
Jude?

538
00:53:33,812 --> 00:53:34,780
Jude.

539
00:53:43,488 --> 00:53:45,254
I'm sorry I scared you.

540
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:48,324
- We were just playing, Mommy.
- It's so good to hear your voice.

541
00:53:59,638 --> 00:54:01,471
There you are.

542
00:54:01,473 --> 00:54:03,274
Been looking all over for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?

543
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,942
No.

544
00:54:05,944 --> 00:54:08,378
Jude. What the hell are
you doing in here? It's not safe.

545
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,313
I'm sorry, Daddy.

546
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:11,817
Jude, he's...

547
00:54:13,018 --> 00:54:14,316
You're talking.

548
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:15,885
Right, let's go.

549
00:54:15,887 --> 00:54:17,687
We're not really supposed to
be in this part of the house.

550
00:54:17,689 --> 00:54:18,557
Come on.

551
00:54:23,028 --> 00:54:25,030
It's so nice
to hear you talking.

552
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:37,409
Joseph,
what happened in this house?

553
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:42,179
Jude, why don't you go
show Brahms the music room?

554
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:44,016
Stay close, mate.

555
00:54:45,851 --> 00:54:46,752
There, uh...

556
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,254
There was a family that
lived here a long time ago.

557
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,424
Had a son, went a bit mad.

558
00:54:54,426 --> 00:54:56,026
Killed a little girl.

559
00:54:56,028 --> 00:54:59,429
Got burnt up in fire.
Wore a mask to hide it.

560
00:54:59,431 --> 00:55:01,731
Lived inside the walls
of the house for 30 years.

561
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:03,232
Never came out.

562
00:55:03,234 --> 00:55:04,403
The Heelshires?

563
00:55:05,037 --> 00:55:06,438
Yeah, the Heelshires.

564
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,007
And?

565
00:55:10,509 --> 00:55:13,009
And the parents
committed suicide.

566
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:14,077
Drowned themselves.

567
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,747
It's a very sad story.

568
00:55:16,615 --> 00:55:18,448
And the son?

569
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:22,052
Well, it all got a bit
messy after the parents had gone.

570
00:55:22,054 --> 00:55:25,287
He killed a man,
very nearly two others,

571
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:27,392
before he was killed himself.

572
00:55:28,794 --> 00:55:30,595
But they're all dead
and buried now.

573
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:34,933
What's the son's name?

574
00:55:36,802 --> 00:55:38,937
His name was Brahms.

575
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:42,439
Did you say Brahms?

576
00:55:42,441 --> 00:55:44,306
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

577
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:46,945
I just didn't think
it'd ever come up.

578
00:55:47,646 --> 00:55:49,548
Thank you for telling us.

579
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:54,152
Come on, Jude.
It's time to go home.

580
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:00,257
Hey, Joseph?

581
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,761
Did you ever find your dog?

582
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:05,161
Yes, I did.

583
00:56:05,163 --> 00:56:07,432
I'm afraid Oz was found
gutted in the forest.

584
00:56:11,903 --> 00:56:13,138
I'm sorry to hear that.

585
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,612
<i>So, your parents tell me
you've been talking again.</i>

586
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:25,749
<i>Is this your new friend
Brahms?</i>

587
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:28,019
<i>He seems like
a very nice friend.</i>

588
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:32,122
<i>What are some of the things
you talk about?</i>

589
00:56:32,124 --> 00:56:35,925
He... tells me
all sorts of things.

590
00:56:35,927 --> 00:56:39,361
Sometimes he tells me about the
other families he's lived with.

591
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,967
<i>Oh. Has he lived
with a lot of families?</i>

592
00:56:43,435 --> 00:56:46,268
He wants to live
with us now.

593
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,439
He was very angry that Mommy and
Daddy wanted to take him away.

594
00:56:49,441 --> 00:56:50,640
<i>Oh.</i>

595
00:56:50,642 --> 00:56:52,142
<i>And when Brahms gets angry,</i>

596
00:56:52,144 --> 00:56:55,781
<i>does he say he wants to
hurt someone or something?</i>

597
00:56:59,384 --> 00:57:02,988
<i>Is there something he wants
to tell your mum and dad?</i>

598
00:57:07,058 --> 00:57:10,126
<i>Well, if Jude had something
to do with the dog's death,</i>

599
00:57:10,128 --> 00:57:13,362
<i>then this is a lot more
serious than we thought.</i>

600
00:57:13,364 --> 00:57:16,032
<i>The doll might be enabling him
to shift blame</i>

601
00:57:16,034 --> 00:57:18,201
<i>for all the bad things
that he might do.</i>

602
00:57:18,203 --> 00:57:22,639
<i>I think it would be a good idea
for me to see him face-to-face.</i>

603
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:25,074
<i>When do you think you can
bring him down to London?</i>

604
00:57:25,076 --> 00:57:27,844
We've got guests coming today,
but we'll bring him as soon as we can.

605
00:57:27,846 --> 00:57:29,712
<i>All right, then.</i>

606
00:57:29,714 --> 00:57:32,316
<i>But I urge you,
keep a close eye on him in the meanwhile.</i>

607
00:58:02,414 --> 00:58:04,346
Jude! Everyone's here.

608
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:06,348
- Anything goes. Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

609
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:09,052
This is just fabulous!
I love it.

610
00:58:09,054 --> 00:58:10,555
Hello.

611
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:16,759
Well, look. There he is.

612
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:19,629
You remember your old Uncle
Liam, don't you?

613
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:21,731
- Hey.
- What? It's not my fault he's mental.

614
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:22,934
Shh, shh, shh.

615
00:58:24,202 --> 00:58:28,370
And...
who's this handsome chap?

616
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:30,540
Brahms.

617
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:33,376
Well. Hello there, Brahms.
Pleased to meet you.

618
00:58:33,378 --> 00:58:35,914
Any friend of Jude's
is a friend of mine.

619
00:58:37,816 --> 00:58:39,816
Okay, children,
why don't we go outside and play

620
00:58:39,818 --> 00:58:41,718
while we all have a catch-up.

621
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,919
Yes.

622
00:58:42,921 --> 00:58:44,988
There's nothing to do outside.

623
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,623
There's nature. All right?

624
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:49,292
It's like a video game,
but real. Go, enjoy.

625
00:58:49,294 --> 00:58:50,795
Come on, Jude.
Show them around.

626
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:56,099
- Maybe I should go with them.
- Nonsense. They'll be fine.

627
00:58:56,101 --> 00:58:57,736
Just stay close
to the house, guys.

628
00:58:59,404 --> 00:59:01,439
- This is so cool.
- Shut up.

629
00:59:05,677 --> 00:59:06,910
I like your doll.

630
00:59:06,912 --> 00:59:07,812
Thanks.

631
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:14,918
This place sucks.
There's nothing to do here.

632
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,419
We could play croquet.

633
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:17,987
I wanna play.
Come on.

634
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:19,858
Don't touch him, Sophie.
He's mental.

635
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:22,959
No, I'm not.

636
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:26,296
My parents say you talk to that
doll, like it's a real person.

637
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:29,432
Because you went crazy
when your mum got attacked.

638
00:59:29,434 --> 00:59:31,634
And we're not supposed
to notice.

639
00:59:31,636 --> 00:59:32,835
Will!

640
00:59:32,837 --> 00:59:36,205
But they know you're mental.

641
00:59:36,207 --> 00:59:39,042
And I know you're mental.

642
00:59:39,044 --> 00:59:41,044
And your stupid doll,

643
00:59:41,046 --> 00:59:42,347
he's the most mental of all.

644
00:59:51,356 --> 00:59:53,024
He's fine, Liza.

645
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:55,894
Have some wine.

646
00:59:58,496 --> 01:00:01,130
It'll do him good to hang out
with some other children.

647
01:00:01,132 --> 01:00:02,067
Yeah.

648
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,037
I'm sorry.

649
01:00:09,574 --> 01:00:11,309
Ever since it happened,
I just...

650
01:00:13,511 --> 01:00:16,312
I can't seem to relax.

651
01:00:16,314 --> 01:00:18,214
Hey, you're with family now.

652
01:00:18,216 --> 01:00:20,018
You don't have anything
to worry about.

653
01:00:21,853 --> 01:00:23,389
And Will won't let
anything happen.

654
01:00:26,392 --> 01:00:27,690
Hey, you're breaking it!

655
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:30,727
- Shut up, nutter.
- Stop it, Will!

656
01:00:30,729 --> 01:00:33,598
Oh, you're sticking up
for your nutter boyfriend now.

657
01:00:37,669 --> 01:00:40,169
Maybe I should
just smash your doll.

658
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:42,839
- Maybe that will make you normal again.
- Don't.

659
01:00:42,841 --> 01:00:44,907
We get to this party,

660
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,776
and we have literally
just walked in the door,

661
01:00:46,778 --> 01:00:50,046
and his pants split
right in the bum.

662
01:00:50,048 --> 01:00:53,049
And not just a little tear,
the whole bum!

663
01:00:53,051 --> 01:00:54,617
I'm going to tell Mum!

664
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:56,054
She'll probably be happy.

665
01:00:56,955 --> 01:00:58,554
Don't touch him.

666
01:00:58,556 --> 01:01:00,223
Or what?

667
01:01:00,225 --> 01:01:03,094
Or he'll make you wish
you never came here.

668
01:01:04,229 --> 01:01:05,595
Did you buy him purple boxers?

669
01:01:05,597 --> 01:01:07,431
I did.

670
01:01:07,433 --> 01:01:08,698
Kinky.

671
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,435
It's good to see
that smile again, Liza.

672
01:01:11,437 --> 01:01:12,471
That old smile of yours.

673
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,540
- Give it back!
- Nah, I don't think I will.

674
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:19,108
Give it back to her.

675
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:21,911
Ooh, now your boyfriend's mad.

676
01:01:21,913 --> 01:01:23,913
Why don't you come get it
from me, mental?

677
01:01:23,915 --> 01:01:26,450
I wouldn't worry
about this doll thing.

678
01:01:26,452 --> 01:01:28,651
Will used to be obsessed
with this blanket.

679
01:01:28,653 --> 01:01:29,986
Run, mental, run.

680
01:01:29,988 --> 01:01:31,222
Stop it, Will!

681
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:34,157
Obsessed.

682
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:38,561
Then one day I realized that it was
quite literally a security blanket.

683
01:01:38,563 --> 01:01:40,630
I think this doll
could be the same thing.

684
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:42,265
Come on, mental.

685
01:01:42,267 --> 01:01:44,734
You shouldn't worry about it,
is what I'm saying.

686
01:01:44,736 --> 01:01:47,070
Kids do all sorts
of weird things.

687
01:01:47,072 --> 01:01:49,072
They go through phases.

688
01:01:49,074 --> 01:01:50,474
And then poof, it's gone.

689
01:02:20,872 --> 01:02:23,608
- Oh, my God.
- What? What's going on?

690
01:02:24,142 --> 01:02:25,343
Will!

691
01:02:29,147 --> 01:02:30,547
Easy, on three. One, two, three.

692
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:31,714
Mind his head!

693
01:02:31,716 --> 01:02:33,349
Slowly. Slowly.

694
01:02:33,351 --> 01:02:35,120
Mary, help
with his head, okay?

695
01:02:36,688 --> 01:02:38,855
Will, I'm coming in.

696
01:02:38,857 --> 01:02:40,291
Sophie, get in the front.

697
01:03:08,554 --> 01:03:10,753
Sweetheart, why don't you
drink some of this?

698
01:03:10,755 --> 01:03:12,054
It'll help you sleep.

699
01:03:12,056 --> 01:03:13,658
A nap will do you good.

700
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:20,231
Okay?

701
01:03:26,204 --> 01:03:27,071
There you go.

702
01:03:31,577 --> 01:03:32,611
Mommy.

703
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:41,853
Everything's okay.

704
01:03:46,357 --> 01:03:48,291
He won't let me go.

705
01:03:48,293 --> 01:03:51,961
He wants me to live in the
big house with him forever.

706
01:03:51,963 --> 01:03:55,800
He said he'd kill you and
Daddy if I didn't do it.

707
01:03:57,902 --> 01:03:58,903
He said that?

708
01:04:03,775 --> 01:04:05,043
When did he say that?

709
01:04:06,978 --> 01:04:08,880
He says it all the time.

710
01:04:10,215 --> 01:04:12,616
I can't control him
anymore.

711
01:04:12,618 --> 01:04:14,653
He keeps getting stronger.

712
01:04:16,221 --> 01:04:17,720
Well,

713
01:04:17,722 --> 01:04:19,625
no one's gonna hurt
Mommy and Daddy.

714
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:22,327
And no one's gonna hurt you.

715
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:24,396
Okay?

716
01:05:20,686 --> 01:05:22,151
Hey, Liza, it's me.

717
01:05:22,153 --> 01:05:24,887
We just saw the doctor.
I think Will's gonna be okay.

718
01:05:24,889 --> 01:05:27,056
So, I'll call you
from the car.

719
01:05:27,058 --> 01:05:28,226
All right.
I love you. Bye.

720
01:06:00,392 --> 01:06:02,392
Not from around here,
are you?

721
01:06:02,394 --> 01:06:03,893
I'm staying
at the Glennview Estates.

722
01:06:03,895 --> 01:06:05,229
Glennview?

723
01:06:06,331 --> 01:06:09,499
Oh, you mean the Heelshire place.

724
01:06:09,501 --> 01:06:12,103
Christ, you couldn't pay me
money to stop there.

725
01:06:13,171 --> 01:06:14,740
- You what?
- You don't know?

726
01:06:16,742 --> 01:06:19,710
Whole family went
completely mad out there.

727
01:06:19,712 --> 01:06:23,014
Something to do with a son living
inside the walls for years.

728
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,127
You see, but that's not the only
thing that happened out there.

729
01:06:38,129 --> 01:06:41,864
There were other
tragedies before.

730
01:06:41,866 --> 01:06:47,303
Back in the '50s, a kid killed
his own mother and brother,

731
01:06:47,305 --> 01:06:49,575
convinced a doll
was speaking to him.

732
01:06:57,383 --> 01:06:59,215
And it's still going on.

733
01:06:59,217 --> 01:07:03,886
Last year, that city man that
bought it after the Heelshires

734
01:07:03,888 --> 01:07:06,322
went a bit mad
and disappeared.

735
01:07:06,324 --> 01:07:08,324
Never heard from again.

736
01:07:08,326 --> 01:07:10,761
I saw him down the pub
one time.

737
01:07:10,763 --> 01:07:12,895
Old crazy Joe.

738
01:07:12,897 --> 01:07:14,230
Crazy Joe?

739
01:07:14,232 --> 01:07:15,931
That's what people
called him, mind.

740
01:07:15,933 --> 01:07:16,835
His name were Joseph...

741
01:07:54,473 --> 01:07:56,305
Oh, my God. Jude!

742
01:07:56,307 --> 01:07:57,275
Jude!

743
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:58,710
Jude!

744
01:08:02,313 --> 01:08:03,181
Jude!

745
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:09,353
Didn't have to be like this.

746
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:14,058
Joseph.

747
01:08:15,527 --> 01:08:16,728
Is Jude okay?

748
01:08:18,397 --> 01:08:20,499
Don't worry. He's safe.

749
01:08:22,835 --> 01:08:25,404
Safer now than he's probably
ever been in his life.

750
01:08:26,204 --> 01:08:27,138
Why are you here?

751
01:08:29,006 --> 01:08:31,175
I'm here because
he wants me to be.

752
01:08:32,176 --> 01:08:33,044
Who?

753
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:35,346
Brahms.

754
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:41,918
He doesn't like it like this,
but you've done it to yourself.

755
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,352
I just wanna know
where my son is.

756
01:08:43,354 --> 01:08:45,187
I will do anything you want.
Just give me my son.

757
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:47,089
I want you to listen!

758
01:08:47,091 --> 01:08:49,495
He wants you to listen!

759
01:08:51,663 --> 01:08:53,998
You asked me why I'm here.

760
01:08:54,867 --> 01:08:56,535
It's the same reason
that you are.

761
01:08:57,603 --> 01:08:59,368
He called me.

762
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,507
He calls out to the ones
that need him.

763
01:09:02,774 --> 01:09:04,374
The damaged ones.

764
01:09:04,376 --> 01:09:06,244
He looks inside you.

765
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:09,180
It was just a whisper...

766
01:09:10,516 --> 01:09:11,850
at first,

767
01:09:12,918 --> 01:09:14,520
when I first came here.

768
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:16,220
So quiet.

769
01:09:17,723 --> 01:09:19,923
And he was in pieces
when I found him,

770
01:09:19,925 --> 01:09:21,292
broken.

771
01:09:23,462 --> 01:09:24,796
And then the voice said...

772
01:09:25,531 --> 01:09:27,031
to put him back together.

773
01:09:29,635 --> 01:09:30,936
So I did.

774
01:09:36,808 --> 01:09:39,308
Then I heard him,
growing inside.

775
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,144
You must've heard it.

776
01:09:42,481 --> 01:09:44,783
Jude sure has. Oh, yeah.

777
01:09:45,484 --> 01:09:47,617
I don't know what Brahms is,

778
01:09:47,619 --> 01:09:50,087
but you can stop this.

779
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:52,455
It's too late.

780
01:09:52,457 --> 01:09:56,225
Brahms and Jude are gonna be
one, and it'll be beautiful.

781
01:09:56,227 --> 01:09:58,397
Everybody thought
that I was crazy.

782
01:09:59,998 --> 01:10:01,733
They thought the Heelshires were
crazy, but, oh, no.

783
01:10:03,167 --> 01:10:05,003
It's always been the doll.

784
01:10:08,907 --> 01:10:11,841
Even before the house, before the
Davies, the ones before that.

785
01:10:11,843 --> 01:10:13,108
I found all their old letters.

786
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:16,415
He knew that you were coming.

787
01:10:18,016 --> 01:10:20,819
He knew your boy
would find him.

788
01:10:22,353 --> 01:10:24,754
That's why he told me
to bury him.

789
01:10:24,756 --> 01:10:27,124
They're always so curious, aren't they?
The little ones are like...

790
01:10:29,093 --> 01:10:30,493
like moths to a flame.

791
01:10:30,495 --> 01:10:33,130
Joseph, where is my son?

792
01:10:33,699 --> 01:10:35,599
I wanna see my son!

793
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:38,336
He's in the big house!

794
01:10:50,314 --> 01:10:51,282
Jude!

795
01:10:56,021 --> 01:10:56,989
Jude!

796
01:11:00,492 --> 01:11:01,460
Jude!

797
01:11:23,347 --> 01:11:24,583
Jude.

798
01:11:26,818 --> 01:11:28,652
Jude?

799
01:11:28,654 --> 01:11:30,154
<i>Over here.</i>

800
01:11:48,874 --> 01:11:50,509
<i>This way.</i>

801
01:12:09,293 --> 01:12:10,462
<i>We're just over here.</i>

802
01:12:47,132 --> 01:12:48,133
Jude...

803
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:01,012
I know you don't
wanna hurt anybody.

804
01:13:03,415 --> 01:13:05,117
This isn't you, Jude.

805
01:13:08,687 --> 01:13:10,756
Please, put him down.

806
01:13:12,758 --> 01:13:14,358
It's going to be okay.

807
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:18,597
Can I hold Brahms?

808
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:37,983
I used to hold you
just like this.

809
01:13:43,054 --> 01:13:44,623
Let's just put him down.

810
01:13:56,535 --> 01:13:57,836
Hello, Mommy.

811
01:14:01,573 --> 01:14:03,742
Jude, put the gun down.

812
01:14:05,911 --> 01:14:07,412
We're very angry.

813
01:14:08,847 --> 01:14:10,715
You and Daddy
have been getting in the way.

814
01:14:13,251 --> 01:14:15,352
We're going to
live here now...

815
01:14:17,088 --> 01:14:18,423
because you can't protect us.

816
01:14:20,192 --> 01:14:21,526
Protect you from who?

817
01:14:22,427 --> 01:14:23,360
That dog.

818
01:14:25,063 --> 01:14:25,897
Will.

819
01:14:27,732 --> 01:14:30,168
And those men from that night.

820
01:14:32,204 --> 01:14:33,271
You're right.

821
01:14:34,873 --> 01:14:37,442
- We do need Brahms to protect us.
- It's too late.

822
01:14:38,176 --> 01:14:40,111
You've given us no choice.

823
01:14:40,912 --> 01:14:42,745
Goodbye, Mommy.

824
01:14:42,747 --> 01:14:47,252
I know Brahms
is telling you what to say.

825
01:14:49,554 --> 01:14:52,889
Which is why we need to
take him home with us.

826
01:14:52,891 --> 01:14:55,393
Brahms needs to be
a member of our family.

827
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:59,931
And what kind of a family
doesn't need a mother?

828
01:15:18,049 --> 01:15:19,217
Mom?

829
01:15:27,392 --> 01:15:28,426
Jude.

830
01:15:30,962 --> 01:15:31,830
What have you done?

831
01:15:34,132 --> 01:15:35,100
What have you done?

832
01:15:36,268 --> 01:15:37,168
Stay back.

833
01:15:39,504 --> 01:15:42,672
It's me he'll punish.
I'm the one who didn't protect him.

834
01:15:42,674 --> 01:15:43,907
No, no.

835
01:15:43,909 --> 01:15:45,911
Joseph, Brahms can't
hurt you anymore.

836
01:15:47,178 --> 01:15:48,280
You don't understand.

837
01:15:48,914 --> 01:15:50,415
It will never be over.

838
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,403
It's gonna be
all right, Brahms.

839
01:18:08,887 --> 01:18:10,487
Mom! You're home.

840
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:12,155
Yes. I missed you.

841
01:18:12,157 --> 01:18:13,890
- I missed you too.
- Really?

842
01:18:13,892 --> 01:18:15,758
- Perfect timing.
- Hey.

843
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,126
Hey, beautiful.
How was your day?

844
01:18:17,128 --> 01:18:18,761
It was good.

845
01:18:18,763 --> 01:18:21,631
I think we might sign that
author I was telling you about.

846
01:18:21,633 --> 01:18:23,266
Yeah? Nice!

847
01:18:23,268 --> 01:18:24,501
All righty.

848
01:18:24,503 --> 01:18:26,437
- This looks so good.
- Thank you.

849
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:28,671
Wait until you taste it,
because I'm pretty confident

850
01:18:28,673 --> 01:18:32,608
that this might be the greatest coq
au vin ever made upon English shores.

851
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:34,343
I'm not even joking.

852
01:18:34,345 --> 01:18:36,447
There's a whole bottle of wine in
here, so I'm not sure if...

853
01:18:36,449 --> 01:18:38,081
No, okay.
I will give you some.

854
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:39,849
- Thank you.
- All right.

855
01:18:39,851 --> 01:18:41,150
This looks so good.

856
01:18:41,152 --> 01:18:42,585
Thank you.

857
01:18:42,587 --> 01:18:44,787
Just two or three hours
of my day. Nothing much.

858
01:18:46,357 --> 01:18:47,824
Is it my turn tomorrow?

859
01:18:47,826 --> 01:18:49,360
Yeah. Cheers.

860
01:18:50,628 --> 01:18:52,263
Good night, my man.
You sleep tight.

861
01:18:54,099 --> 01:18:55,698
I love you, sweetie.

862
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,935
Love you too.

863
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,340
Good night.

864
01:19:59,831 --> 01:20:01,099
Good night, Brahms.

865
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:04,503
I think we'll be happy here.

866
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:07,772
If they learn the rules.

867
01:20:08,764 --> 01:20:13,764

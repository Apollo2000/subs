Anne!

11
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:48,938
Jean? Hi...
What are you doing here?

12
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,023
Where's Georges?

13
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,566
Away. Went 3 weeks ago.

14
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:52,776
Where to?

15
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,277
Kosovo.

16
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,989
Why? Has something happened?

17
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,158
What's your problem?

18
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:03,244
What's going on? What's wrong?

19
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:05,497
I'm not going back.

20
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,750
Why, if you don't mind me asking?

21
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:13,963
Look, I'm in a hurry.
Tell me what's wrong as we walk.

22
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:15,715
When's Georges back?

23
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,802
No idea.
You know what your brother's like.

24
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,595
Is it so urgent?

25
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,597
How did you get to Paris?

26
00:04:23,223 --> 00:04:25,850
On the 1st train.
I've been here an hour.

27
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:26,893
What?

28
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,062
Your fucking door code's changed!

29
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:31,439
Why didn't you call me?

30
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,692
I got the answer-phone.

31
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:36,403
Sorry.

32
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,449
I need a place.

33
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,452
- Sorry?
- Here in Paris.

34
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,247
- How come?
- I fucked off.

35
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,083
You did?

36
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,714
I can't stand him.

37
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,174
Is that all?

38
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,844
He's doing up the old barn.

39
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,596
So? Hold on, you must be hungry, too.

40
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,625
In the bath, I can't hear the phone.

41
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:33,710
What?

42
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:35,086
Forget it.

43
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:37,213
Aren't you hungry?

44
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:46,097
Now where were we?
Oh yes, what's your Dad up to?

45
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,476
He's renovating the barn.

46
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:50,769
So?

47
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,688
To live in when I take over.

48
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:54,939
So?

49
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:58,151
- So, I'm not staying.
- Really?

50
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:01,488
Why not?
Wasn't your dream to run the farm?

51
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:04,282
No, never. That was his dream.

52
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,493
Okay.

53
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,371
This isn't really the time or place.

54
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:12,791
I'll get Georges to call, okay?

55
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:14,292
I'm not going back.

56
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,838
You should know by now
you must do what your father says.

57
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:22,133
Later, you can make your own mind up.

58
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,551
I already have.

59
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:27,931
We'll talk it through later,
now is not the time.

60
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:31,559
The show opened last night,
I got to bed at 4.30,

61
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,521
I just have time to glance at our press,

62
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,691
and in precisely 48 minutes,
I have an important meeting.

63
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,277
Go easy now on my poor little soul.

64
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:45,240
Here, take the keys.
The code is 48B13.

65
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:50,328
If you're tired,
you can stretch out on the couch.

66
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:51,871
I'll be back by 12.

67
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:55,083
Let's be clear: you've seen my place,

68
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,960
there's not room for 3.

69
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,169
Got that?

70
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,923
Remember the code?

71
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:03,758
See you later.

72
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,431
If anyone calls,
let the answer-phone get it.

73
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:24,672
What's with you?

74
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:27,800
Was that a good thing to do?

75
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,093
What?

76
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:32,055
Do you feel that was right?

77
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:35,934
Fuck you.

78
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:37,852
You stupid or what?

79
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:41,147
You're going to say sorry to the lady.

80
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:43,191
Fuck you.

81
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,526
Let go of me!

82
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,279
Who the hell are you? Let go!

83
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,490
Now, say sorry.

84
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,663
Didn't you hear me? Say sorry!

85
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:04,545
Let go, you fuck!

86
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:07,340
It's beyond belief!
What's going on?

87
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:10,301
Clear off out of here! Hooligans!

88
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:11,678
Unbelievable!

89
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,638
Hold on, I can explain.

90
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,598
Don't go.

91
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,309
This young man humiliated the lady.

92
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,895
Just let go of me!

93
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,982
Let go of him! Are you mad?

94
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,859
Why are you picking on him?

95
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,530
Is it your problem?

96
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,282
Who asked your opinion?

97
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:35,910
Do you know what he did at least?

98
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:39,455
Ask before you leap in.

99
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,749
- What's going on?
- He hit me.

100
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:42,959
- Typical...
- What?

101
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:44,252
He hit me!

102
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,171
Maybe you could tell her why?

103
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,841
Do you mind telling me
what's going on?

104
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:53,219
I don't see why I should...

105
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,224
But everyone seems interested,
so I'll tell you.

106
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,227
The lady... Wait there, please.

107
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,189
And you stay here!

108
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,444
Don't go sneaking off.

109
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,654
Get the fuck out of my way!

110
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,366
Let him go, for God's sake!

111
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,036
Stop... Calm down, Jean!

112
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:19,954
Break it up!

113
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,123
What's going on here?

114
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,668
What's he done?

115
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:27,503
They put on quite a show.

116
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:30,256
Wait, I can explain.

117
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:31,924
That's a smart idea.

118
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:38,014
I'll tell you if you give me the chance.

119
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:41,934
This boy, this young man,

120
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:45,605
humiliated a woman begging outside the bakery...

121
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:46,981
What woman?

122
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,400
The one with the yellow bag.

123
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:51,319
Victor...

124
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,280
He threw a scrunched up bag...

125
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,038
Come here.

126
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:13,132
...sitting there, putting off customers.
We're not inhumane, but...

127
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,967
- Thank you.
- Can we go?

128
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,137
You can come and make a statement
if you wish.

129
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:21,140
- Who'll look after...
- Can I have my ID?

130
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,392
ID!

131
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:26,437
Can I have my ID back, too?

132
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:29,190
I doubt it. What do you think?

133
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,610
Come along to the station first.
Understand?

134
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:34,946
Understand?

135
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,448
Good...

136
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:39,826
Take his details.

137
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,870
Please, this way.

138
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:50,294
I've done nothing wrong.
I'm coming of my own free will.

139
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,671
Don't make trouble.

140
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,297
You don't need to touch me.

141
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:55,716
I'll come, no problem.

142
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,970
If you don't comply,
I'll put the cuffs on. Okay?

143
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:00,304
Come on.

144
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:12,441
<i>In the vaulted cellar
of a badly damaged oil press.</i>

145
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:16,654
<i>Our group includes Mark Henderson of Newsweek,</i>

146
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:20,449
<i>myself and a dozen KLA fighters.</i>

147
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,996
<i>Originally, we were aiming for Drenica</i>

148
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,332
<i>to meet up with an even smaller group</i>

149
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,376
<i>but our plans changed.</i>

150
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:33,379
<i>I tried writing often</i>

151
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,132
<i>but gave up.</i>

152
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,509
<i>I didn't know what to say.</i>

153
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,679
<i>Outside, it's very quiet.</i>

154
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:44,599
<i>The firing stopped hours ago.</i>

155
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,435
<i>Waiting is the worst.</i>

156
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:50,980
<i>Antoine's 5 on May 11.</i>

157
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,233
<i>I hope to be back in Paris by then.</i>

158

<i>Eve promised I'd have him for the day.</i>

159

<i>"Break a leg" for your play.</i>

160

<i>Chin up, it'll be crap.</i>

161
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:08,956
<i>You won't get this in time,
but you'll be great.</i>

162
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,419
<i>Sorry for my behavior on our last day.</i>

163
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,796
<i>If you see Jean-Pierre...</i>

164
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:23,221
Yes?

165
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:25,848
What?

166
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,477
I don't have time, I have a fare.

167
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:32,563
When?

168
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,524
What did he do?

169
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,277
How many cops came?

170
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:41,239
They took him away again?

171
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:47,578
Call Aystan and Meyssa,
I'm on my way.

172
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,673
Can you slow down, please?

173
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:01,968
Sorry, sir, I'm in a big hurry.

174
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:04,512
It's very important.

175
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,598
I don't want to end up in hospital
because of you.

176
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,852
Are you deaf? I said, slow down.

177
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,729
Sorry.

178
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,399
What the...

179
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:21,696
I'm sorry.
I'll drop you at the taxi stand.

180
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,032
I don't believe this!

181
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,873
Sir, there's a taxi right there.

182
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,378
I'm very sorry.
There's absolutely no charge.

183
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:43,926
What a nerve!

184
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:56,856
Rokia? Put your mother on.

185
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:03,321
<i>You can leave that there.
Just dump it on the chair.</i>

186
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:07,908
<i>Leave your script there, too.
You know it, I hope?</i>

187
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,327
<i>Of course.</i>

188
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,038
<i>Great. So we can go without a net.</i>

189
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:17,001
<i>We'll take it from just
after he locks her in.</i>

190
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:18,961
<i>The camera is the door.</i>

191
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:22,006
<i>You can play it straight at us.</i>

192
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,134
<i>Luc, ready to roll?</i>

193
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:26,635
<i>I'm ready.</i>

194
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:30,056
<i>Should I read his part?</i>

195
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,640
<i>That'd be good.</i>

196
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:42,985
<i>You hear him lock the door.
You go to make sure.</i>

197
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:46,906
<i>The door is indeed locked.</i>

198
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,285
<i>It's locked, you will never get out.</i>

199
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:55,790
<i>Sorry?</i>

200
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,876
<i>You will never get out.</i>

201
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,381
<i>What do you mean?</i>

202
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,926
<i>I mean you will die here.</i>

203
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,473
<i>Is this a joke?</i>

204
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:14,558
<i>Not for me.</i>

205
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,852
<i>For you neither, I'm afraid.</i>

206
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,870
<i>Look at the ceiling.</i>

207
00:16:37,123 --> 00:16:39,291
<i>Do you see the light fitting?</i>

208
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,547
<i>It's an inlet for gas lighting.</i>

209
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:50,136
<i>See now why I asked
if you had a lighter?</i>

210
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,306
<i>You could use it to blow us both up.</i>

211
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,102
<i>Okay, what do you want?</i>

212
00:16:58,936 --> 00:16:59,895
<i>Nothing.</i>

213
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,149
<i>I have nothing against you.
Nothing at all.</i>

214
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,276
<i>I like you.</i>

215
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:08,571
<i>You just fell into my trap.</i>

216
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,283
<i>What do you mean,
I fell into your trap?</i>

217
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,910
<i>It means you're going to die.</i>

218
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:20,458
<i>I merely want to watch you die.</i>

219
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,717
<i>Please, stop now.</i>

220
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:34,180
<i>You've had your fun.
Now, let's forget all about it, okay?</i>

221
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,808
<i>I'm expected home.
I have no time for games.</i>

222
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:40,352
<i>Neither have I. Believe me.</i>

223
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,065
<i>Can you hear a whistling noise?</i>

224
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,027
<i>From the ceiling.</i>

225
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:52,156
<i>Soon, you'll be able to smell it.</i>

226
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,459
<i>Stop...</i>

227
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,546
<i>Stop, please.</i>

228
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,760
<i>Let me out! Please!</i>

229
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,971
<i>You're wasting our time.</i>

230
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:21,268
<i>What do I have to do?</i>

231
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:24,438
<i>Show me your true face.</i>

232
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,441
<i>What?</i>

233
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,069
<i>Your true face.</i>

234
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,073
<i>What do you mean?</i>

235
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,284
<i>What do you want?</i>

236
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,954
<i>I want to see your true face.</i>

237
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,290
<i>Not your lies nor your tricks.
A true expression.</i>

238
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,501
<i>What do I have to do?</i>

239
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,586
<i>Be spontaneous.</i>

240
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:50,548
<i>React to what's happening.</i>

241
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:53,717
<i>How?</i>

242
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,027
Hello.

243
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,441
Beets. That's all there is.

244
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:14,621
They turned the apartment upside down.

245
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,499
We had a house full.
Everyone saw it.

246
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,126
The shame of it.

247
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:21,712
And your son?

248
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:24,840
He's a good boy.
He's never done any harm.

249
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:28,552
He's the eldest. He helps a lot.
He's a good boy.

250
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,178
I know...

251
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,264
They beat and shamed him.

252
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,433
May Allah punish them.

253
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,393
He did nothing wrong.

254
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,229
They had no choice but to let him go.

255
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,815
They had nothing on him.

256
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:46,028
I don't know who brought this upon him.

257
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:52,034
I cooked <i>fעyע</i>
and took it to the homeless,

258
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,162
but all my sacrifices are in vain.

259
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,080
I have no power.

260
00:24:57,456 --> 00:24:59,541
You must protect him.

261
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,508
Do you have anything of his?

262
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:55,305
We must never forget
where we come from and who we are.

263
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,391
We are not sons of slaves.

264
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:03,772
Your son is a proud, honest boy.
His heart is pure.

265
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:08,694
But he sees a lot of whites,
as you know.

266
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:13,281
Someone disapproves
and wants him to return.

267
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,158
Return where?

268
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:16,576
Home.

269
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:20,247
To the land of his ancestors.

270
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:24,501
That's ridiculous.
Who could possibly want that?

271
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,171
I have no idea.

272
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:38,265
It's the same one who bewitched Salimata

273
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,058
and made her mute.

274
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:42,602
What have we done to him?

275
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:45,814
Salimata's illness is different...

276
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:51,361
While Lica and Mאrioara delivered the calf,

277
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:54,781
Uncle Nelu gave instructions
on his mobile from Rome:

278
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,201
when to pull, how to cut the cord,

279
00:26:58,368 --> 00:26:59,995
rub the calf with straw...

280
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:03,498
It was their first time, you see?

281
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,543
Mobile phones are wonderful.

282
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,879
Mאrioara's cousin, Georghe, has one.

283
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:11,965
He says that in some places

284
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,342
you can call without paying

285
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:15,844
because

286
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,638
there's some kind of trick, see?

287
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,599
I wouldn't know.

288
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,685
You've never used a mobile?

289
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,605
Only when someone lent me one.

290
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,566
But when you called home?

291
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,029
- Granny!
- Yes?

292
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:36,573
When you used to call home?

293
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,450
I used a public call box.

294
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:41,036
Nicu, go see where he is.

295
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,541
Maria!

296
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:11,056
Cost half what Vasile brought back.

297
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:15,769
There must have been 350-400 people
at the funeral.

298
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,354
From Cluj even.

299
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,773
He was an important man.

300
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:22,108
And they're self-important.

301
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:25,487
You'd rather they chuck
the old man in a hole?

302
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,489
What if we did that to you?

303
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:28,865
It's true, Mama!

304
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,242
You must respect people's labor.

305
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:33,870
You don't work for people to gossip.

306
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:36,956
Same for Dumitru.
But Papa keeps harping on.

307
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:41,127
Do Nuta and Nicu
like their father being abroad?

308
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:42,545
Not to mention me!

309
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:45,006
But you don't stop jabbering.

310
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:47,425
True enough.

311
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:51,221
Quiet now so Mama can look round in peace.

312
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,848
Nicu, give me that chocolate.

313
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:56,768
That's your third bar.
Give it to me!

314
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,186
How many were there?

315
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,146
I don't remember. He's okay.

316
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:01,356
Give me that!

317
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,026
It's beautiful.

318
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,905
Very good.

319
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:20,417
Where did the couch come from?

320
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:23,628
Ciocan gave it to Dumitru for helping out

321
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:25,630
when he was home.

322
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:28,758
Lovely.

323
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:33,430
- Do you like it?
- Sure, it's fine.

324
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:36,599
Shame there's no chairs with it.

325
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,852
She has delusions of grandeur,

326
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,771
but who knows if she'll need all that.

327
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,273
Don't listen to him.

328
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:47,902
Sorin's parents said
they'd be better in his house,

329
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:51,114
since ours won't be ready for the wedding.

330
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,908
Of course, his is bigger, better

331
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,577
and lots more besides.

332
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:58,705
- You don't like this one?
- Yes I do!

333
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:01,124
- But Sorin doesn't?
- He does.

334
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,751
It's not finished, that's all.

335
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,211
Of course...

336
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:08,381
They want to make us feel grateful.

337
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:11,551
Sorin's mother says Nuta
may be too young.

338
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:14,304
Women's tales.
His father gave me his word.

339
00:34:14,471 --> 00:34:17,932
If they don't want the house,
Florica can have it.

340
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,351
Then, she might even find a man.

341
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,770
Shut up, Papa, you're drunk.

342
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:39,282
Hi, it's Georges.

343
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:42,452
Thanks. Can you put Jacky on?

344
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:48,916
Hello, my man.

345
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:53,338
I called from the airport
but your line was busy.

346
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:59,093
Groggy, but I'm okay.

347
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:01,721
I'll be in tomorrow at 10.

348
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:05,767
How do the photos look?

349
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:09,187
Sorry?

350
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:14,359
Maybe 20 km from Drenica.
I wrote it on the roll.

351
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:17,236
She needs glasses.

352
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,073
Precisely!

353
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,744
When did he fly out?

354
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,038
Via Kabul?

355
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:30,625
Yeah, I heard it on the radio.

356
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:34,212
No, I was in Tirana at the time.

357
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:39,050
Anne's home. I'll call you back.

358
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:42,595
You know where to get me.

359
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,139
See you tomorrow.

360
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,064
Good morning, sir.

361
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,609
Good morning, miss.

362
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:00,238
You okay?

363
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:02,115
I'm okay.

364
00:38:05,785 --> 00:38:08,246
I hope the bath doesn't overflow.

365
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:09,956
Me, too.

366
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:40,862
Hello, you.

367
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:50,032
Does the heating work?

368
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,202
It was totally overhauled 4 years ago.

369
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,913
If you wish, I'll show you the boiler.

370
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:59,876
Now we come to what was the music room.

371
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:01,627
This way...

372
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,463
A superb room.

373
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:08,426
The paneling provides excellent acoustics.

374
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:13,264
Very pretty.

375
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:19,145
Strange lighting, though.

376
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,525
Why are there no windows?

377
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:27,737
They're walled up and concealed.

378
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:29,697
For the acoustics, I guess.

379
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,032
Hold on...

380
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:36,829
Can you hear the silence?

381
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:39,624
Quite amazing with all that traffic.

382
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,548
What's behind this door?

383
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:49,884
A hallway to the stairs.

384
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:52,762
The key was lost.
I'll have a copy cut.

385
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:54,263
No, thanks, I don't.

386
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,723
Unfortunately, I do.

387
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:01,812
Maybe you have a...?

388
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:03,064
Sorry, no.

389
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,942
Excuse me.
My briefcase is next door.

390
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:08,486
I'll get a light and be right back.

391
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:20,706
She's too head-on to camera.

392
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,417
The mark fell off

393
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:25,503
during the pan...

394
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,550
Shot 16, take 4.

395
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:38,224
Action!

396
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:42,436
Almost 3,000 square meters.
2,800 to be precise.

397
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:46,732
The trees and hedges ensure total privacy.

398
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:48,109
So I see.

399
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:50,111
Shall we go on?

400
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:01,539
Everything is in excellent condition.

401
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:04,333
The windows, doors, wallpaper...

402
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:06,794
The floor's been varnished.

403
00:43:13,843 --> 00:43:15,761
Does the heating work?

404
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:18,889
It was totally overhauled 4 years ago.

405
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:21,559
If you wish, I'll show you the boiler.

406
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:25,771
Now we come to what was
the music room.

407
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:27,273
This way...

408
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:30,234
A superb room.

409
00:43:31,402 --> 00:43:34,488
The paneling provides excellent acoustics.

410
00:44:31,462 --> 00:44:34,298
Then, there's the inspector who begins

411
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:38,427
to link the crimes
and build a profile of the killer.

412
00:44:38,803 --> 00:44:41,847
He's helped by his own personality

413
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:45,392
being very similar to the realtor's.

414
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:47,394
What happens to you?

415
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:50,940
I can't tell you.
It'd spoil the surprise.

416
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:53,150
When's the film coming out?

417
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:56,529
No idea. We haven't finished shooting yet.

418
00:44:56,695 --> 00:45:00,950
Christmas, I guess, or the New Year.
I've truly no idea.

419
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:02,952
There you are, sir.

420
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:04,829
Bones all gone.

421
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:06,413
Thank you, miss.

422
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,750
What service! Look and learn.

423
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:13,170
Are you back from a war zone?

424
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:15,923
How does it feel, civilization?

425
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:19,218
I feel an urge to do my expenses.

426
00:45:19,385 --> 00:45:20,719
Seriously?

427
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:23,389
Seriously, it's not too bad.

428
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:26,058
It's all so obvious. At first.

429
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:27,935
Then, the crunch comes.

430
00:45:28,102 --> 00:45:29,103
Meaning?

431
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:31,272
I don't know...

432
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:35,151
Over there, it's simple.
Here, life is complicated.

433
00:45:35,985 --> 00:45:40,447
There, it's hard at first.
Then you get into the swing of it.

434
00:45:40,614 --> 00:45:42,950
Did you bring your dentist's address?

435
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:44,743
Sure... You want it now?

436
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,287
No. So I don't forget.

437
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:49,081
It comes and goes.
It doesn't hurt now,

438
00:45:49,248 --> 00:45:51,000
but press and it's agony.

439
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:54,545
I know... I'll give you the address afterwards.

440
00:45:54,712 --> 00:45:56,547
- Seen Martin yet?
- No.

441
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:58,841
He's in a terrible way.

442
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:00,551
It's almost moving.

443
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:01,468
What happened?

444
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:05,723
Julie hit him with it.
She took the kids and moved out.

445
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:10,561
I called all morning.

446
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:13,439
I only arrived 2 hours ago. Claudine...

447
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:17,359
He could get off

448
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:21,030
except the captain had his passport on board.

449
00:46:21,197 --> 00:46:24,366
To disembark for a month with his passport,

450
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:26,869
he had to prove he had a job.

451
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:29,830
Ashore, he met a fellow Malian...

452
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:34,251
I booked a window table.

453
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:37,630
Mister Traore?

454
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,216
That's right, Amadou Traore.

455
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:42,218
I'll just check.

456
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:48,307
This is fine.
Let it go, we're here now.

457
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:51,810
If you want...

458
00:46:56,148 --> 00:46:57,274
So?

459
00:46:57,942 --> 00:47:00,110
So, what? Oh, right...

460
00:47:00,778 --> 00:47:04,573
So the guy from Mali
promises to find him a job.

461
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:06,742
They ask the captain

462
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:09,870
to give back the passport once he's hired.

463
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:12,581
The captain agrees.

464
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:17,378
1 hour later, the Malian returns,
panting as if he's run miles.

465
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:20,089
He says his boss will hire him,

466
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:24,510
but needs his passport
to confirm his particulars.

467
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:27,429
The captain hands it over,

468
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:31,183
but tells my father to stay put
as a guarantee.

469
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:35,771
Sorry, sir, your booking was for 7.30.
It's now 8.15.

470
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:38,774
The window tables are very popular...

471
00:47:38,941 --> 00:47:40,526
It's 8.15 already?

472
00:47:45,698 --> 00:47:48,575
Well, never mind.
Can we have the menu?

473
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:50,244
Coming right up.

474
00:47:54,665 --> 00:47:55,749
Say,

475
00:47:57,001 --> 00:47:58,585
is that a watch?

476
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:03,299
Don't you like it?

477
00:48:07,303 --> 00:48:08,512
So-so.

478
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,525
So, he had to stay on the boat?

479
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:27,197
Yes. The only way from his cabin
to the gangplank,

480
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:30,951
was past the captain's cabin,
whose door was wide open

481
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:33,454
so no one could leave unseen.

482
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:36,749
There was a bigger boat alongside.

483
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,631
Sorry.

484
00:48:45,883 --> 00:48:47,176
It's not ours.

485
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:48,177
Isn't it?

486
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:52,181
If someone asks, it's behind the bar, okay?

487
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:54,850
What are you drinking?

488
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:58,771
- How about you?
- Don't know.

489
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:02,983
Our house cocktail is light
and a real thirst-quencher.

490
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:05,361
Sound good?

491
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:09,615
- A cocktail and a Perrier.
- Fine.

492
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:33,430
So, what did he do?

493
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:39,103
He pulled on two pairs of pants,

494
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,855
several shirts and sweaters

495
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:43,690
and left the rest.

496
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:46,693
He climbed ashore via the other ship

497
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:49,988
and got his passport back.

498
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:51,782
Cool!

499
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:57,538
My Dad can tell you stories like that
for days on end.

500
00:50:01,917 --> 00:50:03,127
Have you chosen?

501
00:50:08,257 --> 00:50:09,508
One cocktail

502
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:11,844
and a Perrier.

503
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,723
Found anything you like?

504
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:20,310
Not yet.

505
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:23,021
Take your time.
The kitchen closes at midnight.

506
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,783
That you have to photograph
death and destruction

507
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,202
so I know what war is?

508
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:39,955
Starving kids so I know what famine is?

509
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:41,748
What a dumb assumption!

510
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:45,210
Don't get worked up,
it'll ruin your meal.

511
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,130
We won't see eye to eye, Francine.

512
00:50:48,464 --> 00:50:50,507
For you, it's theory.
For me, real life.

513
00:50:50,674 --> 00:50:53,552
But you can't say that in your photos.

514
00:50:54,845 --> 00:50:55,846
True.

515
00:50:56,013 --> 00:50:57,931
So, why do you do it?

516
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,978
Back on your favorite argument?

517
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:04,229
Why not?

518
00:51:04,396 --> 00:51:06,982
If I can't attack my friends,
who's left?

519
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:09,860
Me, darling. I'm your punchbag.

520
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:12,863
Look over by the wall.

521
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:16,492
The black kid who hassled Jean.
Don't let him see...

522
00:51:47,189 --> 00:51:48,398
Hi there, Maria!

523
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:51,652
Mihai Popa! How are you doing?

524
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:53,237
Well. Very well.

525
00:51:53,946 --> 00:51:54,905
So I see.

526
00:51:55,072 --> 00:51:56,823
We do our best. And you?

527
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,991
I'm fine, too.

528
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:00,160
On your way home? Jump in.

529
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:01,161
Don't worry.

530
00:52:01,328 --> 00:52:04,456
It's on my way.
You have a big, heavy bag.

531
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:18,136
- When did you get back?
- A few weeks ago.

532
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,639
- And you?
- Last week.

533
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:24,101
- How's Mirela?
- Very well.

534
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:27,771
She nannies for a couple, both doctors.

535
00:52:27,938 --> 00:52:28,939
Where?

536
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:30,232
Dublin.

537
00:52:31,024 --> 00:52:34,278
I look after the garden
and everything else.

538
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:36,863
I'm only here for shearing.

539
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,949
You've landed on your feet.

540
00:52:39,116 --> 00:52:40,659
You could say.

541
00:52:43,495 --> 00:52:45,581
What about you? How was Paris?

542
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:47,457
Fine.

543
00:52:47,624 --> 00:52:49,001
Find a job?

544
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:52,170
A good one. In a school.

545
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:54,631
Great! How long did you stay?

546
00:52:54,798 --> 00:52:56,758
- 4 months.
- Is that all?

547
00:52:57,593 --> 00:52:59,553
I missed the children.

548
00:52:59,928 --> 00:53:01,930
And Dragos missed you, eh?

549
00:53:03,056 --> 00:53:04,182
We're here.

550
00:53:11,565 --> 00:53:12,649
Thanks.

551
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:13,942
My pleasure.

552
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:15,527
Your house looks good.

553
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:17,446
- Is it finished?
- Nearly.

554
00:53:17,613 --> 00:53:19,781
- When's the wedding?
- Spring.

555
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:22,659
Go on... Thanks again.

556
00:53:22,826 --> 00:53:25,037
Are you going to Olteanu's wedding?

557
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,330
Ask Dragos.

558
00:53:26,496 --> 00:53:29,750
If there's drink, he'll come.
It'll be good.

559
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:30,917
I hope so.

560
00:53:31,084 --> 00:53:32,461
Say hello to Dragos.

561
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:35,005
And to Mirela in Dublin.

562
00:54:47,744 --> 00:54:50,622
Hello, Nathalie, it's Anne... Anne Laurent.

563
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:53,542
Never mind. Can I speak to Georges?

564
00:54:54,418 --> 00:54:55,419
Is he?

565
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:58,046
When will he be back?

566
00:54:58,422 --> 00:55:00,257
Doesn't Jacky know either?

567
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:04,386
No, it doesn't matter.

568
00:55:06,722 --> 00:55:08,807
Ask him to call me, will you?

569
00:56:22,172 --> 00:56:23,298
Hello, Mrs. Becker.

570
00:56:23,465 --> 00:56:24,466
Hello.

571
00:56:25,509 --> 00:56:27,344
Did you write this?

572
00:56:27,511 --> 00:56:28,345
No.

573
00:56:29,846 --> 00:56:31,181
I didn't write anything.

574
00:56:31,348 --> 00:56:33,266
Won't you read it, at least?

575
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:35,310
I don't have my glasses.

576
00:56:35,852 --> 00:56:37,479
I didn't write anything.

577
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:40,106
I don't write notes like that.

578
00:56:41,024 --> 00:56:42,359
Are you sure?

579
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:46,363
You would tell me, wouldn't you?

580
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:50,116
- I don't know what you want.
- Nothing.

581
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:52,869
I thought it was your writing.

582
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:53,870
I'm sorry.

583
00:56:54,037 --> 00:56:55,622
So am I.

584
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,673
In the distance, far off, are lights,

585
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,634
yellow lights, twinkling.

586
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:09,845
I see them through the walls.

587
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:14,391
Shapes coming toward the house.
I can't identify them.

588
00:57:14,558 --> 00:57:17,102
They want to get in.

589
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:20,689
They bang and scrape
on the walls and door.

590
00:57:21,857 --> 00:57:23,608
Then the door bursts open...

591
00:57:25,861 --> 00:57:27,362
I wake up

592
00:57:27,779 --> 00:57:29,656
and try to jump up,

593
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:31,658
but I can't move.

594
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:36,246
No sound comes out.
I implore Allah to help me.

595
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:41,334
As I'm praying,
I hear loud laughter behind me.

596
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:43,461
Then, I screamed.

597
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:46,047
Youssuf woke and turned a light on.

598
00:57:47,424 --> 00:57:49,384
I was hysterical,

599
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:54,890
there was no one there
who could've laughed.

600
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:02,480
That's when the migraines started?

601
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:04,149
When I get them,

602
00:58:04,316 --> 00:58:05,817
I can't even move.

603
00:58:05,984 --> 00:58:10,238
It's as if someone's driving a stake
through my head.

604
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:13,408
What did the white doctor say?

605
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:17,203
He's just a friend of Amadou's,
he gave me some pills.

606
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:24,169
"Dear Papa, I'm leaving.
Please, don't try to find me. Jean."

607
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,266
I have no idea!

608
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:23,687
It can't have been the kid.

609
00:59:23,853 --> 00:59:27,941
She wouldn't sign it, "a defenseless child".
It's dumb!

610
00:59:28,108 --> 00:59:30,944
A 10-year-old girl wouldn't write that.

611
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,196
It's an old person's writing.

612
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:34,948
It must be the neighbor, then.

613
00:59:35,115 --> 00:59:35,782
So?

614
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:37,951
So, either you believe her or not.

615
00:59:38,118 --> 00:59:39,536
It's as simple as that?

616
00:59:39,703 --> 00:59:41,746
Not simple, inescapable.

617
00:59:41,913 --> 00:59:44,791
If you do, call the cops.
If not, forget it.

618
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:47,752
- Or ask the kid's parents.
- Ask them what?

619
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:50,839
"Do you hit your child?
Torture her ever?

620
00:59:51,006 --> 00:59:52,632
"Why is she always screaming?"

621
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,426
Tricky, eh?

622
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:01,224
Chablis or Sancerre?

623
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:02,851
I don't give a shit!

624
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,063
You don't care, do you?

625
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:10,150
I do, but you got the letter.
Not me.

626
01:00:10,692 --> 01:00:13,862
- I can't decide for you.
- You could fucking help!

627
01:00:15,155 --> 01:00:18,324
It's too easy just to wash your hands of it.

628
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:22,037
I never hear her crying.
I don't even know her.

629
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:23,872
I don't know her parents.

630
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:26,541
I met the old lady three times.

631
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:30,253
Not my problem!
Can you get that into your head?

632
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:45,101
It's never your problem.

633
01:00:45,268 --> 01:00:47,437
When there's trouble, you're gone.

634
01:00:47,604 --> 01:00:50,356
- Of course, you're right.
- Aren't I?

635
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:04,704
Why don't you grow up and stop
letting others decide for you?

636
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:06,915
And you never run away?

637
01:01:07,082 --> 01:01:09,125
Eh? What about your son?

638
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:11,044
Your needle's stuck!

639
01:01:12,504 --> 01:01:14,172
What are you getting at?

640
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:48,748
What if I was expecting a child?

641
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:52,085
What are you saying?

642
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:53,711
I'm pregnant.

643
01:01:55,213 --> 01:01:57,507
What if I was pregnant?

644
01:01:57,674 --> 01:02:00,468
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not a joke.

645
01:02:01,594 --> 01:02:03,721
I aborted while you were away.

646
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:06,057
Did you?

647
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:07,684
You decide.

648
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,191
Is there a problem?

649
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,028
What is this?

650
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:21,698
Do you expect me to take you seriously?

651
01:02:21,865 --> 01:02:23,158
No, I don't.

652
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,206
Have you ever made someone happy?

653
01:02:33,168 --> 01:02:34,460
Tell me.

654
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:40,758
Is there a single person
you have made happy?

655
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:44,679
No.

656
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:29,390
Didn't you want some rice?

657
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,964
Is that setting a good example?

658
01:04:44,173 --> 01:04:46,467
What's Salimata going to think?

659
01:04:47,677 --> 01:04:50,305
Later on, what will the children think?

660
01:04:50,972 --> 01:04:51,848
Answer me.

661
01:04:52,015 --> 01:04:54,559
- But there was a group of them.
- Nonsense!

662
01:04:55,518 --> 01:04:58,396
- The teacher said...
- She can say what she wants.

663
01:04:58,563 --> 01:05:02,108
You'd rather believe a white shrew
than your own son?

664
01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:05,862
The mother who told the teacher
caught her son red-handed.

665
01:05:06,029 --> 01:05:06,946
And the teacher said?

666
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:10,867
She raises him single-handed.
She can't cope.

667
01:05:11,326 --> 01:05:13,619
I check his pockets every morning.

668
01:05:13,786 --> 01:05:16,247
- I'm talking to my son.
- And I'm talking to you!

669
01:05:16,414 --> 01:05:18,791
I won't be silenced because I'm sick.

670
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,293
What's the teacher say?

671
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:23,171
The woman caught her son smoking weed.

672
01:05:23,338 --> 01:05:25,381
He gave 3 names, including Demba.

673
01:05:25,548 --> 01:05:28,217
And as the only black kid,
he's the guilty one.

674
01:05:28,384 --> 01:05:28,926
Quiet!

675
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:31,137
He'll end up in jail, too.

676
01:05:31,304 --> 01:05:35,099
Wash your mouth out!
Amadou is innocent.

677
01:05:35,266 --> 01:05:37,894
Look how they all follow his example.

678
01:05:38,061 --> 01:05:40,355
He hangs out with white girls

679
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:43,191
instead of looking out for his brother.

680
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:45,401
As for your daughter,

681
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:48,363
look at her, with her yellow crew cut!

682
01:05:48,529 --> 01:05:50,698
Demba, answer me truthfully.

683
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:52,909
What have I done to you?

684
01:05:53,076 --> 01:05:54,702
Be quiet!

685
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:57,663
I can't hear myself think.

686
01:05:58,664 --> 01:06:01,209
Demba, I want to believe you,

687
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,462
but if you lie to me,

688
01:06:04,921 --> 01:06:07,632
you'll regret it all your life!

689
01:06:07,799 --> 01:06:09,092
Well?

690
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:12,261
It was Franחois.

691
01:06:12,804 --> 01:06:15,515
He took my jacket in the school yard.

692
01:06:16,224 --> 01:06:17,683
Who is Franחois?

693
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:24,190
He's the kid whose mother
went to see the teacher.

694
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:28,945
He said he'd give my jacket back

695
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:31,948
if I gave him 100 francs.

696
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:35,993
I said I didn't have that much,

697
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:38,329
but he just laughed.

698
01:06:38,788 --> 01:06:40,748
He threw my jacket down

699
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:42,708
and trampled on it.

700
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:44,961
He said

701
01:06:45,128 --> 01:06:48,381
I was lucky he didn't ask for 200

702
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,593
and if I didn't bring him 100 francs,

703
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,053
the next day,

704
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:57,974
I wouldn't recognize my jacket.

705
01:07:00,685 --> 01:07:04,981
He said I'd just have
to steal the money from home.

706
01:07:08,568 --> 01:07:10,027
He still has my jacket.

707
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:11,446
Meaning?

708
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:14,490
I didn't give him the cash.

709
01:07:15,074 --> 01:07:17,076
That's why he was angry

710
01:07:17,785 --> 01:07:19,620
and fingered me.

711
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:23,541
Is that the truth?

712
01:10:32,688 --> 01:10:35,650
If you desire the spleen

713
01:10:37,443 --> 01:10:41,906
and will laugh yourselves into stitches,
follow me.

714
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:47,453
That gull Malvolio

715
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,247
has come to court my lady

716
01:10:59,382 --> 01:11:01,258
in yellow stockings,

717
01:11:03,636 --> 01:11:05,554
cross-gartered

718
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:13,145
most villainously!

719
01:11:16,148 --> 01:11:19,568
I have dogged him like his murderer.

720
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:22,071
He obeys every point of the letter.

721
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:24,615
He does smile his face

722
01:11:25,074 --> 01:11:28,494
into more lines

723
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:30,287
than is in the new map

724
01:11:30,454 --> 01:11:32,873
with the augmentation of the Indies.

725
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,334
You never saw such a thing.

726
01:11:35,501 --> 01:11:38,462
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.

727
01:11:41,549 --> 01:11:44,260
I know my lady will strike him.

728
01:11:46,387 --> 01:11:47,722
If she do,

729
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:52,560
he'll smile

730
01:11:52,727 --> 01:11:55,020
and take it for a great favor.

731
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,148
Anyone out there?

732
01:12:41,817 --> 01:12:43,235
To make a new life.

733
01:12:43,402 --> 01:12:45,571
<i>When's he coming back?</i>

734
01:12:46,906 --> 01:12:47,948
I've no idea.

735
01:12:49,784 --> 01:12:52,369
<i>I miss him.</i>

736
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:56,665
I miss him, too. We all miss him.

737
01:12:56,832 --> 01:12:58,584
He doesn't miss us.

738
01:12:59,084 --> 01:13:02,004
<i>He'll be sad all by himself.</i>

739
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:05,466
He won't be all by himself.

740
01:13:06,217 --> 01:13:09,595
There's his brother and all his family.

741
01:13:09,762 --> 01:13:13,057
He'll take a new wife half my age.

742
01:13:13,224 --> 01:13:15,476
Show some respect for your father!

743
01:13:15,643 --> 01:13:17,603
<i>Where is he going?</i>

744
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,188
If he was here...

745
01:13:19,355 --> 01:13:20,523
Very far.

746
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,609
What would you say if he was here?

747
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:26,612
Stop wanting to be so strong.

748
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:28,656
He'll be traveling a long time.

749
01:13:28,823 --> 01:13:30,074
<i>How?</i>

750
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:33,452
First, by car.

751
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:35,871
Then, on a boat.

752
01:13:36,038 --> 01:13:38,249
Then, by car again.

753
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,627
<i>Will he ever come back?</i>

754
01:13:41,794 --> 01:13:43,420
Remember Uncle Akי.

755
01:13:44,505 --> 01:13:48,425
Did he come back?
Safi's still waiting...

756
01:13:48,592 --> 01:13:50,427
Papa is old, you know.

757
01:13:51,846 --> 01:13:53,222
It's his home.

758
01:13:53,389 --> 01:13:55,057
<i>Where?</i>

759
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:57,434
Africa.

760
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:01,063
<i>Where is Africa?</i>

761
01:16:31,088 --> 01:16:33,716
- When?
- 2 weeks on Monday.

762
01:16:34,258 --> 01:16:37,052
Ion Fratila's wife is driving us to Halmeu,

763
01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:38,971
near the border.

764
01:16:41,098 --> 01:16:44,393
- How many of you?
- 5 so far. You'll make it 6.

765
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:47,896
Anyone from the village?

766
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:52,317
Have a think about it.

767
01:16:52,484 --> 01:16:54,194
It's a good opportunity.

768
01:16:54,987 --> 01:16:56,280
Don't you think, Mama?

769
01:16:57,281 --> 01:16:59,408
I'll have to talk to Dragos.

770
01:17:00,868 --> 01:17:02,077
Of course.

771
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:07,708
- Do you want one?
- Thanks.

772
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:11,420
I can't see Papa saying no.

773
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:15,090
I said, I'll talk to Dragos.

774
01:17:21,013 --> 01:17:23,849
Thought that he'd be married soon

775
01:17:24,099 --> 01:17:27,644
and so he'd have a house
ready to live in.

776
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:32,191
It took us most of spring.

777
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:37,321
Franחois lent a hand
despite him being so busy.

778
01:17:38,614 --> 01:17:39,698
But no!

779
01:17:41,075 --> 01:17:42,993
His lordship didn't like it.

780
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:51,502
How come Franחois called you?

781
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:53,378
He's concerned.

782
01:17:56,507 --> 01:17:57,925
Why? About me?

783
01:18:02,888 --> 01:18:05,140
He should mind his own business.

784
01:18:05,307 --> 01:18:06,308
He wanted to help.

785
01:18:06,475 --> 01:18:08,644
That's why he's doing all this?

786
01:18:10,187 --> 01:18:11,897
Because of the bulls?

787
01:18:14,358 --> 01:18:15,859
He should be happy.

788
01:18:16,485 --> 01:18:19,488
He'll get more for his.
He needs all he can get.

789
01:18:24,952 --> 01:18:26,620
Where's Jean now?

790
01:18:28,831 --> 01:18:30,833
What are you asking me for?

791
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,755
I have no idea.

792
01:18:38,465 --> 01:18:40,300
How would I know?

793
01:18:42,261 --> 01:18:45,055
I'm too busy to run after him.

794
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:48,225
In any case, he's right,

795
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:51,145
there's no future here.

796
01:18:53,522 --> 01:18:56,692
At least, he won't have
to get up at 5 a.m.

797
01:18:57,693 --> 01:18:59,653
He can laze about all he likes.

798
01:19:00,821 --> 01:19:02,573
What? Isn't it the truth?

799
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:05,909
Do you lot in the city
get up at 5 a.m.?

800
01:19:07,411 --> 01:19:10,289
You know. You blazed the trail for him.

801
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:17,421
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

802
01:19:17,671 --> 01:19:18,714
It's okay.

803
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:24,803
The truth isn't like that.

804
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:31,310
Are you hungry?

805
01:19:33,896 --> 01:19:35,189
No, thanks. Really.

806
01:19:35,355 --> 01:19:37,149
Even after your drive?

807
01:19:37,316 --> 01:19:39,151
Honestly, Papa, don't worry.

808
01:19:48,118 --> 01:19:50,913
How are things? Acting going well?

809
01:19:51,455 --> 01:19:53,081
I'm getting on fine.

810
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:57,711
I've just shot a thriller.

811
01:19:58,378 --> 01:20:00,797
You must go and see it
when it's released.

812
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:08,889
You'll have to write me
with the title when it's finished.

813
01:20:11,183 --> 01:20:14,394
Prettier every day.
Far too good for you.

814
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:21,944
The way you're going,
next time I won't recognize you.

815
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:29,493
It'll be called <i>The Collector...</i>

816
01:20:30,285 --> 01:20:31,578
Probably.

817
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:38,752
What are you going to do?

818
01:20:42,172 --> 01:20:43,548
About what?

819
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:45,217
"About what"?

820
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:48,512
- About looking for Jean?
- Nothing!

821
01:20:50,222 --> 01:20:54,101
It's been 6 weeks.
He should know where he belongs.

822
01:20:57,062 --> 01:20:59,648
He'll come back when he wants or...

823
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:01,275
Or what?

824
01:21:02,025 --> 01:21:03,068
Or...

825
01:21:09,449 --> 01:21:10,534
Excuse me.

826
01:21:13,996 --> 01:21:15,998
I left the pump running out there.

827
01:21:25,382 --> 01:21:26,550
I feel sorry for him.

828
01:21:26,717 --> 01:21:28,593
That won't help him.

829
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:34,308
What are you going to do?

830
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:42,024
And no noise! Understand?
No speak!

831
01:21:42,858 --> 01:21:45,944
If they find you, finito l'amore!
Get it?

832
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:50,365
Okay, boss. No worry.
We understand, boss.

833
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,079
Do business in box, okay?
Nothing dirty up there.

834
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:58,915
They smell you,
it's like they hear you!

835
01:21:59,082 --> 01:22:00,250
Get it?

836
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:01,626
Yes, boss.

837
01:22:05,589 --> 01:22:09,593
In Paris, wait for me to open up.
Don't get excited.

838
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,678
Wait till we get to depot.

839
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:14,264
Of course, boss. We wait.
Thank you.

840
01:22:14,431 --> 01:22:16,767
That's all. Have a nice trip.

841
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:21,313
Believe that little Franחoise

842
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:24,441
has already entered Your kingdom.

843
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:28,820
In Your goodness, grant us

844
01:22:29,863 --> 01:22:32,532
that we might one day share with her

845
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,118
in eternal life.

846
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:37,913
Through Jesus Christ, Amen.

847
01:25:19,157 --> 01:25:21,826
<i>The second day, on the road
from Ghurian to Herat.</i>

848
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:25,413
<i>They separated us.
I was left in a totally dark room.</i>

849
01:25:26,456 --> 01:25:28,625
<i>A Taliban fighter appeared every 2 hours,</i>

850
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:31,836
<i>silhouetted in the doorway,
pointing at me.</i>

851
01:25:32,003 --> 01:25:34,089
<i>"You French," he'd say,</i>

852
01:25:35,215 --> 01:25:38,260
<i>before miming cutting his throat.</i>

853
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:40,804
<i>Absolutely charming.</i>

854
01:25:42,097 --> 01:25:44,683
<i>After 2 days, the guy was replaced.</i>

855
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:47,894
<i>A new guard turned up.
He had a flashlight</i>

856
01:25:48,061 --> 01:25:49,938
<i>and asked in perfect English...</i>

857
01:25:52,691 --> 01:25:54,317
<i>I felt so relieved.</i>

858
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:57,529
<i>I told him my story:</i>

859
01:25:57,696 --> 01:26:00,115
<i>photographer, big misunderstanding, etc...</i>

860
01:26:00,282 --> 01:26:02,492
<i>He listened and said...</i>

861
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:09,082
<i>I thought he seemed reassuring,
so I told it again,</i>

862
01:26:09,249 --> 01:26:11,209
<i>slowly and more clearly.</i>

863
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:15,672
<i>First time round,
I'd garbled half of it.</i>

864
01:26:16,965 --> 01:26:19,676
<i>When I'd finished,
he looked at me and said...</i>

865
01:26:22,304 --> 01:26:26,433
<i>It was all he could say,
but he didn't even know what it meant.</i>

866
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,644
<i>In the end, Phil got us out

867
01:26:29,811 --> 01:26:31,771
<i>by using his contacts at CNN.</i>

868
01:26:33,398 --> 01:26:36,067
<i>You can mention it to Francine.
It'll make her laugh.</i>

869
01:26:39,446 --> 01:26:42,490
<i>In my cell, I thought about what she said.</i>

870
01:26:42,657 --> 01:26:45,702
<i>Don't tell her,
she'll be even more unbearable.</i>

871
01:26:47,787 --> 01:26:50,999
<i>It's easy to talk about
"ecology of the image"</i>

872
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:54,169
<i>and "value of the non-transmitted message".</i>

873
01:26:54,669 --> 01:26:57,047
<i>What matters is the end result.</i>

874
01:26:58,715 --> 01:27:01,468
<i>I guess she finds it all too bothersome.</i>

875
01:27:03,386 --> 01:27:04,971
<i>After all, she could be right.</i>

876
01:27:06,389 --> 01:27:08,183
<i>How would knowing help her?</i>

877
01:27:12,187 --> 01:27:14,606
<i>I don't think I'm fit for life in peace.</i>

878
01:27:14,773 --> 01:27:17,275
<i>What you call "peace" at least.</i>

879
01:27:19,778 --> 01:27:23,907
<i>4 days in Kabul now,
waiting for something to happen.</i>

880
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:28,119
<i>People are polite but wary.
I can hardly blame them...</i>

881
01:28:53,455 --> 01:28:56,124
Excellent! Did your husband make it?

882
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:57,041
Yes.

883
01:28:57,625 --> 01:29:00,378
You can tell.
It's nothing like that gutrot.

884
01:29:00,545 --> 01:29:01,671
Here, son.

885
01:29:01,838 --> 01:29:03,423
Where's Lenutza?

886
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:05,508
Lenutza left 2 weeks ago

887
01:29:05,675 --> 01:29:09,512
to meet her sister in Italy
and work picking grapes.

888
01:29:10,263 --> 01:29:12,557
She went with a big group.

889
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:14,559
Who has her card?

890
01:29:15,226 --> 01:29:16,269
I've no idea.

891
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:18,271
Who has Lenutza's card?

892
01:29:18,438 --> 01:29:19,439
What?

893
01:29:19,606 --> 01:29:22,400
Who bought Lenutza's yellow card?

894
01:29:22,567 --> 01:29:25,487
That new girl from Aliceni maybe. Mirela.

895
01:29:25,653 --> 01:29:26,946
That's right. Mirela...

896
01:29:27,113 --> 01:29:31,659
A few days before Lenutza left,
4 people from Aliceni arrived.

897
01:29:31,826 --> 01:29:34,162
One of them bought her card.

898
01:30:52,073 --> 01:30:54,284
What are you so upset about?

899
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:56,995
- Are you homesick?
- No!

900
01:30:57,412 --> 01:30:59,539
I wanted to sell newspapers.

901
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,458
What do you mean?

902
01:31:03,918 --> 01:31:06,629
Before I left, I called Lenutza.

903
01:31:07,547 --> 01:31:10,967
She promised me her license to sell papers.

904
01:31:11,342 --> 01:31:13,303
She wanted to go home.

905
01:31:14,637 --> 01:31:16,681
Can't you just apply?

906
01:31:16,848 --> 01:31:19,434
I was deported a few months ago.

907
01:31:20,602 --> 01:31:21,978
You'll find something.

908
01:31:22,145 --> 01:31:23,146
Of course...

909
01:31:24,814 --> 01:31:25,899
Sure I will.

910
01:31:35,325 --> 01:31:37,160
One day, in Certeze,

911
01:31:37,744 --> 01:31:40,705
I gave some money to a gypsy beggar.

912
01:31:41,789 --> 01:31:45,043
She was so dirty,
I ran to wash my hands,

913
01:31:45,627 --> 01:31:47,837
to avoid catching a disease.

914
01:31:48,379 --> 01:31:50,340
She simply disgusted me.

915
01:31:51,925 --> 01:31:53,343
So?

916
01:31:54,761 --> 01:31:56,346
Last winter,

917
01:31:57,263 --> 01:31:59,140
on Boulevard St. Germain,

918
01:31:59,307 --> 01:32:03,061
a well-dressed man
was about to give me 20 francs...

919
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:08,358
But when he saw

920
01:32:11,027 --> 01:32:12,695
my outstretched hand,

921
01:32:13,154 --> 01:32:17,075
he threw the bill into my lap
as if I nauseated him.

922
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:27,377
I rushed back here
and hid myself in the attic.

923
01:32:29,295 --> 01:32:31,422
I cried my eyes out all day.

924
01:32:31,923 --> 01:32:34,467
It was so embarrassing.
Do you see?

925
01:32:41,849 --> 01:32:43,101
You can't take it.

926
01:32:46,187 --> 01:32:47,772
You don't measure up.

927
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:53,695
- Say what?
- I love you.

928
01:32:55,363 --> 01:32:57,407
- I love you, too.
- But I really love you.

929
01:32:57,949 --> 01:32:59,826
- Really truly?
- Really truly.

930
01:33:00,243 --> 01:33:01,077
True true?

931
01:33:01,244 --> 01:33:02,328
True true.

932
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:08,584
Pierrot!

933
01:33:12,171 --> 01:33:13,339
Don't move!

934
01:33:13,548 --> 01:33:15,133
Wait! Don't move.

935
01:33:44,996 --> 01:33:47,206
What do you think you were doing?

936
01:33:47,373 --> 01:33:49,500
Can't you see it's dangerous?

937
01:33:50,418 --> 01:33:52,003
But there's a balloon!

938
01:34:01,846 --> 01:34:05,808
If you do that again,
you'll get your first ever smack!

939
01:34:05,975 --> 01:34:08,019
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Dad.

940
01:34:08,186 --> 01:34:09,937
I feel sick.

941
01:34:26,454 --> 01:34:27,789
Get out of here.

942
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:30,458
I can't let you out of my sight.

943
01:34:39,217 --> 01:34:40,718
We have to move.

944
01:34:40,885 --> 01:34:41,719
What?

945
01:34:42,261 --> 01:34:44,764
I can't live on the 20th floor

946
01:34:44,931 --> 01:34:46,891
always worrying he'll fall.

947
01:34:49,227 --> 01:34:50,853
Let's stop there.

948
01:34:53,731 --> 01:34:54,941
And start where?

949
01:34:55,108 --> 01:34:56,776
From the top, of course.

950
01:34:56,943 --> 01:34:58,027
Really?

951
01:34:59,904 --> 01:35:01,572
Just winding you up.

952
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:05,535
No, the shot after all the gurgling,

953
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:08,704
when you say: "I love you, too..."

954
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,541
Why bother? It was fine.

955
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:13,417
Except for the plane.

956
01:35:14,127 --> 01:35:15,044
What plane?

957
01:35:15,211 --> 01:35:17,380
You can hear a plane fly over.

958
01:35:18,506 --> 01:35:20,133
Okay, kids, let's do it!

959
01:35:26,097 --> 01:35:27,765
I love you, too.

960
01:35:28,724 --> 01:35:30,393
Sorry. Let's try again.

961
01:35:38,943 --> 01:35:40,570
Okay, here we go!

962
01:35:44,907 --> 01:35:46,617
I love you, too.

963
01:35:57,545 --> 01:35:59,463
Okay, calm down.

964
01:36:08,306 --> 01:36:11,225
Can we just calm down?
We've lots to get through.

965
01:36:11,392 --> 01:36:12,476
I'm sorry.

966
01:36:13,603 --> 01:36:15,605
Down to business.

967
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,999
Recess is now ended.

968
01:36:36,334 --> 01:36:39,795
Let's try to act grown up
and get some work done.

969
01:36:48,596 --> 01:36:51,182
Is it so hard to tell him
"I love you"?

970
01:36:53,017 --> 01:36:54,518
No, not really.

971
01:37:22,004 --> 01:37:23,047
Thank you.

972
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:25,174
Here, for you.

973
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:27,885
Thank you. Beautiful car, sir.

974
01:38:56,307 --> 01:38:57,433
Excuse me,

975
01:38:57,892 --> 01:38:59,894
aren't you a top model?

976
01:39:02,104 --> 01:39:04,148
Honestly, with your looks,

977
01:39:04,315 --> 01:39:06,650
you just have to be in that line.

978
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:11,655
I'm in the biz, too.

979
01:39:12,114 --> 01:39:13,449
Wouldn't guess, eh?

980
01:39:13,908 --> 01:39:15,993
You wouldn't, would you?

981
01:39:18,037 --> 01:39:19,580
I was at the gym.

982
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:22,208
So, miss...

983
01:39:24,001 --> 01:39:25,795
Don't talk to commoners?

984
01:39:28,756 --> 01:39:30,674
Didn't offend you, did I?

985
01:39:30,841 --> 01:39:34,136
I wonder if you're one of these rich,

986
01:39:34,887 --> 01:39:37,306
beautiful people from high society.

987
01:39:38,849 --> 01:39:39,683
No?

988
01:39:43,854 --> 01:39:45,564
A shy little typist, then?

989
01:39:45,731 --> 01:39:49,777
Waiting for Prince Charming
to race up in his Ferrari.

990
01:39:49,944 --> 01:39:51,195
Is that it?

991
01:39:52,488 --> 01:39:54,448
I don't get it.

992
01:39:54,615 --> 01:39:57,868
How can you be so beautiful
yet so arrogant?

993
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:06,585
That's not very nice!

994
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:10,005
What am I going to do by myself

995
01:40:10,339 --> 01:40:12,174
in the big, bad city?

996
01:40:12,925 --> 01:40:14,343
Tell me that.

997
01:40:15,970 --> 01:40:19,265
What do you say?
Isn't that a cheap trick?

998
01:40:19,432 --> 01:40:22,059
Maybe I'm not good enough for her.

999
01:40:22,476 --> 01:40:25,855
For the lady to be in the subway
with the tramps,

1000
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:28,190
there must be a reason.

1001
01:40:28,357 --> 01:40:30,818
It's the chauffeur's day off.

1002
01:40:31,861 --> 01:40:33,446
Yeah, that must be it.

1003
01:40:37,116 --> 01:40:38,659
What about you, ma'am?

1004
01:40:39,785 --> 01:40:41,328
What do you think?

1005
01:40:42,288 --> 01:40:43,956
Nothing? Is that so?

1006
01:40:45,458 --> 01:40:47,418
Shame! She doesn't think.

1007
01:40:55,593 --> 01:40:57,261
Now what will you do?

1008
01:40:58,304 --> 01:41:00,556
Stand me up again?

1009
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:03,434
Hop off into the next car?

1010
01:41:03,601 --> 01:41:05,102
It's too easy...

1011
01:41:05,853 --> 01:41:08,147
Why? Do I smell?

1012
01:41:08,981 --> 01:41:10,065
Is that it?

1013
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:15,029
I'm just a little Arab
looking for a little affection.

1014
01:41:15,196 --> 01:41:16,989
Like everyone else.

1015
01:41:18,282 --> 01:41:19,742
Nothing doing?

1016
01:41:22,036 --> 01:41:23,037
Never mind.

1017
01:42:07,456 --> 01:42:09,083
You crazy jerk!

1018
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:22,388
Who's a jerk?

1019
01:42:23,013 --> 01:42:24,640
Shame on you!

1020
01:43:28,746 --> 01:43:30,164
I'll see you around.

1021
01:43:30,664 --> 01:43:31,957
Don't worry.

1022
01:44:01,654 --> 01:44:02,738
Thank you.

1023
01:56:50,839 --> 01:56:53,675

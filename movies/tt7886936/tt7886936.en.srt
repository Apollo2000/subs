Yeah, no, that is it.

88

OK... OK.

93

No, no, no.

94
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,200
Are you kidding me?

95
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,325
Bwahhh... That was...

96
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:31,409
...great.

97
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:35,992
That was great. It was great.
Thank you for...for that. Uh...

98
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:43,283
Oh... Stupid...bell.

99
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:45,783
OK.

100
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:47,158
I'm just gonna...

101
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:50,991
Oh, thank you again for that.
Thank you.

102
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:02,949
Two or the same as.

103
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,658
Just remember that, at least.

104
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:07,658
So, the full bit is
a low standard deviation indicates

105
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:11,240
the value must be close to
or the same as...

106
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:15,032
the mean or expected value.
Got that?

107
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:18,782
Yeah, me neither. All right.
Give number four on page 60...

108
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:22,115
Hey, Eddie, how come
you didn't touch Tracey's boob?

109
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,657
Jesus, Kev!
- Kev, what is wrong with you?

110
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:27,365
What?
It's true, he didn't, they just said it.

111
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,490
It's not my fault
he doesn't like girls.

112
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:32,657
I love boobs.
- All right, yeah, thank you.

113
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:34,407
So, um, anyway...

114
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:11,156
What the fuck?
- Shit.

115
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,905
You perving on us?
- I said 30 minutes.

116
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,155
What can I say?
We had to make it last.

117
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,905
Yeah, I wish.
That place is filthy.

118
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,280
I know,
you should really get a hotel

119
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:26,821
Hm.

120
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,946
Have you thought about
what you're going to do next year?

121
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:31,321
Fucking lesbian!

122
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:33,863
Wha...?

123
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:37,071
I...I am NOT a lesbian.

124
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,738
What were those two up to?

125
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,487
Dunno.
- Teen pregnancy waiting to happen.

126
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:53,154
You had me at 19.

127
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,195
It'd be an ugly bloody baby at that.

128
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:57,195
I'm going to do...

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,279
Remember, boys don't respect girls
that spread their legs.

130
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:01,695
Mam!

131
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:06,779
Your dad would be so proud of you.

132
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:10,737
Do you want to stay home tomorrow?

133
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:12,945
The school will understand.

134
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:16,695
We could light a candle
for his anniversary.

135
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:19,111
It's OK.

136
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:21,236
Thanks.

137
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:27,194
Would you not try a bit of lipstick?

138
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:30,194
Jesus, mam,
make up your mind!

139
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,360
You've got to be
fucking kidding me. Another six months?

140
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:16,693
No, you don't have to do it twice,
you applied for that!

141
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:19,152
Hannah, I...
- Just open the door.

142
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,984
Ready for the first fitness test?
- Mm-hm.

143
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,484
Great.
Can you, um...do a chin-up yet?

144
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:40,692
Ian.
- What?

145
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:43,442
There's more to life than chin-ups.
- Not in the Cadets.

146
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:47,442
Uh... Eddie shifted a girl today.

147
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:50,734
Oh.

148
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:53,401
Word is he didn't touch her tits.
- Jack!

149
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,400
Who said that?
- A few people like, you know...

150
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:58,983
A few people in every class,
like everyone...

151
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:01,191
Everyone said it.
- Look. Sh. It's fine.

152
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,566
That's all right,
that's respectful, right?

153
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:06,066
No, no, I didn't have time!
The bell rang!

154
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:08,858
I was literally about to grab it.
- Jesus!

155
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,775
Is she your girlfriend?

156
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,691
W-We don't want to put a label on it.

157
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:17,233
But, yes.
- Good.

158
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:20,400
That's good,
you're becoming a man.

159
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,066
See? I knew
we didn't have to worry.

160
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:25,983
Jesus, Ian.

161
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,107
I just don't know if I can vote.

162
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:33,107
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

163
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:39,899
Hey. Hey! Hey...

164
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:47,690
This place is such a hole.

165
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,065
Hello?

166
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:02,106
Wahey, wanker!
State of him.

167
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:04,981
Hey, Tracey.

168
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:08,731
Uh, do you wanna go
to the cinema sometime?

169
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,148
Huh?

170
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:14,564
Or just like a milkshake.
Maybe?

171
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:18,356
No? OK. Uh...

172
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:20,273
Just meet my parents?

173
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:22,273
Fuck off.

174
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:23,731
OK.

175
00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:27,981
It's fine.
I'm gonna go this way.

176
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,148
OK, OK, OK, OK...

177
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:35,563
Homo!

178
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:48,647
# Feels like nothing

179
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:52,480
# And it looks like
you're nothing at all... #

180
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:53,897
Fuck!

181
00:11:57,272 --> 00:12:00,313
Did you throw a rock at me?
- You didn't stop. Anyway...

182
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:02,230
I'll go out with you.

183
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:05,896
What?
- On a date!

184
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:07,812
Wanna go out or not?

185
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,229
Benders!

186
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:16,146
OK.

187
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:19,146
Oscar's Cinema. 7 PM.

188
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:26,396
'The cancer, it's spread.'

189
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:31,104
'Oh... No.'

190
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:34,771
'You can't just make me
fall in love with you and then die.'

191
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,478
'Do you think
I wanna leave you, Karen?'

192
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:43,020
'I love you more than anything,

193
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:45,811
you and our unborn child.'

194
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,020
'I'll never let him forget you.'

195
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,186
'It's a boy?'
- 'Yes!'

196
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:57,478
'Oh, Karen!'

197
00:12:57,603 --> 00:13:00,978
People are all over Oasis,
but fuck them,

198
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:02,645
it's all about Bikini Kill.

199
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,311
Kathleen Hanna is proper punk.

200
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,770
Have you heard them?

201
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:08,311
Of course not.

202
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:12,394
And what do you see?
Female bass players, that's it.

203
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,727
So, you think women shouldn't play bass?
- Of course they should be bass players!

204
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:19,102
Don't fucking...
- Don't touch me!

205
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:22,852
Fucking patriarchy!
Have you read Simone de Beauvoir?

206
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:25,852
Uh, it's, uh...

207
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:27,477
It's on my list.

208
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,560
So, why do you want to join
the fascist war machine?

209
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,310
What?
- The army.

210
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,143
I believe...

211
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:52,351
...that the fire of war
turns one into a man.

212
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:57,393
It's the Irish army. They're more likely
to be filling in for bin men on strike.

213
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,684
What else can I do?

214
00:14:00,726 --> 00:14:02,476
Besides, it's a family tradition.

215
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,059
Was your grandad in the army too?
- No, he was a farmer.

216
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:10,893
It needs to be more than one person
in order to be a tradition.

217
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,268
Yeah, well,
I'll make it a tradition, then!

218
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:14,768
Jesus.

219
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,225
She's holding his hand.

220
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:26,058
Jesus, Ireland's roads are so shit.

221
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:36,142
Did I give you my condolences
about your dad?

222
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:40,850
You probably muttered "I'm sorry
for your troubles" at some point.

223
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:43,517
Good.
That was good of me.

224
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,392
And I'm sorry for your troubles.

225
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:48,516
You didn't make him do it.

226
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,557
Or did you?

227
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:55,057
No, no, of course not!

228
00:14:55,724 --> 00:14:58,599
Joking.
- Jesus, Amber.

229
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:11,891
Thanks.

230
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:16,224
I had fun.

231
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,307
Really?
- Yeah.

232
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,390
OK.

233
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:30,890
W-What the hell are you doing?!
- I don't know! I thought that...

234
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:33,140
You're gay!
- Gay for boobs!

235
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:36,598
I can see your hard-on
under the desk for Sweeney!

236
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:38,181
I like his clothes.

237
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:41,015
One, only a gay guy would say that.

238
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
And two, he dresses like shit,

239
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:46,765
which you would know because
gays have a great sense of fashion.

240
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,223
Well, there you go,
there you go, I'm not gay. So...

241
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:51,265
Yes, you are.

242
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:56,472
So am I.

243
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:03,805
Aren't you tired
of being called a faggot?

244
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:05,889
Well, yes, because I'm not one.

245
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:10,472
We pretend to go out
just to get everyone to leave us alone.

246
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,972
Just until school is over
and we can get out of this dump.

247
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:19,014
Amber, I'm not...

248
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:23,847
...ready for a serious relationship.
- Eddie...

249
00:16:23,972 --> 00:16:26,304
I just broke up with Tracey

250
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:29,471
and I need to play that field.

251
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:32,763
Play that field.
And I-I don't want to get tied...

252
00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:34,721
down.

253
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,179
OK.

254
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:42,679
Jesus, just forget I said anything.
- I think that'd be best.

255
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:11,678
Faster! Come on, you pansies!

256
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:13,720
This isn't knitting club!

257
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:15,637
Faster!

258
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:18,095
Come on, Cotter!

259
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,678
I'll make a man out of you yet.

260
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:23,137
'Hey.'
- 'Hi, how are you?'

261
00:17:23,262 --> 00:17:25,970
'Good, you?'
- 'Good. I like your bike.'

262
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:27,970
'Cheers.'
- 'It's cool.'

263
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:30,636
'A guide to love-making.'

264
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:48,802
'Jesus will now
make the vagina slippery

265
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:51,052
to accept the man's love.'

266
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:56,719
Not Amber's.

267
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:58,469
Kev.

268
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:02,261
'Remember, you have an audience.'

269
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:24,426
'God bless us all.'

270
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:32,510
So sensitive.
I mean, it's not offensive, it's a fact.

271
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:35,342
Obviously it's Oasis.
- Blur!

272
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:37,050
Oasis!
- Blur!

273
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:47,217
What?

274
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,842
Do you want the shifts?

275
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,134
Yes.

276
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,467
Yes, I do.

277
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:09,841
Well?

278
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:11,758
Fine.

279
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:14,174
I'll be your boyfriend.

280
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:16,591
Pretend-boyfriend...

281
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:19,633
Pretend-real boyfriend.

282
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,216
Just till school is over.

283
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:22,466
Yeah.
- Yeah.

284
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:23,799
Or...
- Yeah.

285
00:19:23,924 --> 00:19:25,383
Or longer. No?

286
00:19:25,924 --> 00:19:28,466
OK.
- Sss...

287
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:30,341
Just because we are...

288
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:35,049
You know, uh...
- You can say it. Gay.

289
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,508
Well, just because...
- I'm gay, you're gay.

290
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:39,591
We're gay. Two big gays.
- OK...

291
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:41,298
A big, gay wall.
- Stop saying it.

292
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:43,882
Stop.
And there's nothing gay about the wall.

293
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:47,090
But it doesn't matter what we are,
but we don't have to be.

294
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:51,673
Sure.
- OK.

295
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,257
Ah, mm, ugh...
- If it's gonna work...

296
00:19:56,382 --> 00:19:58,965
What, "ugh"?
It's a hand! So, just take it

297
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,673
because people need to think
that we like each other, so, take it.

298
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:06,715
See it's...
- We have to... Yeah, thank you.

299
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:09,548
This was your stupid plan.

300
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:11,423
X there...

301
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,797
OK, so, substitute your known values
into the...

302
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:26,006
Eddie, how far did you get?

303
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:30,547
Mm...

304
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:32,547
Nice.

305
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:35,589
I always thought you two were benders.
- Kev!

306
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:38,131
That's it. Principal's office.
- What?

307
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:41,172
But...I'm being nice!
I'm saying they're not benders!

308
00:20:41,297 --> 00:20:42,214
Now.

309
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:44,381
Oh, my...

310
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:47,796
Quicker.

311
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:53,005
I'm going...as fast...

312
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,713
Guys, no touching.

313
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:16,630
Eddie, could you hang on a sec?

314
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:21,004
I'll, uh...

315
00:21:21,837 --> 00:21:23,295
see you outside...

316
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:26,212
...sweetheart?

317
00:21:26,337 --> 00:21:27,837
Sure thing, babe.

318
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:36,795
Everything OK?

319
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,379
Yeah.

320
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:42,754
Just if the guys are giving you stick,
you can talk to me.

321
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:46,837
They're not.
They're not, it's just, um...

322
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:49,628
It's just...

323
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:53,378
High...jinks. High jinks.
It's high, high jinks.

324
00:21:55,128 --> 00:21:56,169
OK.

325
00:21:58,753 --> 00:22:01,836
Well, if you need to talk,
I'm here, all right?

326
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:05,711
Mm-hm.
- OK, cool. See you later.

327
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:06,961
OK.

328
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:31,585
Did you confess
your love for Sweeney?

329
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,710
Shut up.

330
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:34,877
I don't get it,
he looks like a maths teacher.

331
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:37,877
Because you're a lesbian
and he is a maths teacher.

332
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:41,793
Speaking of which, you should act
a little less...you know...

333
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,627
...mannishly.

334
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:46,377
What?

335
00:22:47,418 --> 00:22:48,627
Walk more feminine.

336
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:51,835
Feminine?
- Yes, fem... Just a bit of hip!

337
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,334
So, like you?

338
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,751
Wait, what am I doing wrong?

339
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:01,751
Basically, walk like
you're repressing all of your emotions

340
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:03,501
and you have no joints.

341
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:05,751
OK.

342
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:08,542
No, no!

343
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,751
By the way, if anyone asks,
I have already fingered you.

344
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,917
After one day?!

345
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:16,626
I want people to think I'm straight,
not a slut.

346
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:20,001
Wasn't slut
a patrarchal construct?

347
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:21,459
Patriarchal!

348
00:23:21,584 --> 00:23:23,459
A patriarchal construct.
- Jesus!

349
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:26,084
This is what happens
when you teach men new words.

350
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,125
And they pay you ten quid?
- Yep.

351
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,291
Who?
- Everyone.

352
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,750
Your mam has no clue?
- No.

353
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,791
How much have you made?

354
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,083
Nearly 2,000.

355
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,166
Yeah, that's a lot of tenners.

356
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,916
Well, there are a lot of horny teens.

357
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,583
Plus, I need as much as I can get.

358
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,416
The minute school is over,
I am out of here.

359
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,125
This place will kill you.

360
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:04,707
Where are you gonna go?

361
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:06,832
London.

362
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,124
I'm going to open
an anarchist bookshop,

363
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,040
but with franchise potential.

364
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:14,832
It's a good idea.
- Yeah.

365
00:24:15,457 --> 00:24:18,415
Anyway, I'd better go.

366
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,040
Some horny teens need me.

367
00:24:21,624 --> 00:24:23,290
Come to my house
for dinner tomorrow?

368
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:26,665
OK.

369
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:31,956
Wear something girly!
- I will if you won't!

370
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:44,498
First girlfriend home for dinner.
- Second girlfriend.

371
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,581
I thought
the first one didn't count or...

372
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:49,248
No, she definitely does.

373
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:51,414
Oh.

374
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:55,248
You'd better get changed.
Amber's gonna be here.

375
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:58,956
Who?
- Eddie's Amber. Amber Keenan.

376
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:02,914
Oh, right, yes. Yeah, right.

377
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,163
Didn't she find her dad hanging--
- Not the time, Ian.

378
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:08,288
Right.

379
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,580
Uh, how did the fitness test go?
- Great.

380
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:12,788
Good.

381
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,830
Imagine if the Commandant's son
didn't make the cut.

382
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,455
I'd never live it down.

383
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,497
I mean, of course I would.

384
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:22,455
Of course I WOULD.
Of course you will.

385
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:27,413
Yeah, you should...go and get that.

386
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:31,913
Oh, my God.

387
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:41,662
You look beautiful.

388
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:43,662
Thanks.

389
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:46,996
You're welcome. So, can I...
- Mm...

390
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:48,329
Come here.

391
00:25:49,037 --> 00:25:50,412
Right, OK.

392
00:25:50,537 --> 00:25:52,121
Come in.
- Hi!

393
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:54,454
Hello.
- Come in, please.

394
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:09,786
Um...

395
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:13,620
Amber, Eddie was saying that you
help your mam out in the caravan park.

396
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:14,620
I hate it.

397
00:26:16,245 --> 00:26:17,745
Right. It's-It's nice for her.

398
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:24,245
Do you, um... Or have you
decided what you'll do next year?

399
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,578
Probably study English
or History or Politics,

400
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:32,453
or maybe work for a zine.

401
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,911
It's a self-published magazine.

402
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:40,703
Um, is there much money
in the zine scene?

403
00:26:41,952 --> 00:26:43,202
Tonnes.

404
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:46,994
Oh. That's interesting. Eddie,
you might consider that as a choice.

405
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:51,285
I'm joining the army.
- But it's just one option, isn't it?

406
00:26:51,952 --> 00:26:53,369
It's a very solid option.

407
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:56,327
The army takes a lot of sacrifice,
that's all.

408
00:26:56,869 --> 00:26:58,702
So does marriage.
- Pardon?

409
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:03,910
So does marriage.
- What sacrifices have you made?

410
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,035
Do you want it in writing?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

411
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,494
Like a list?
- Yes, a list.

412
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:11,619
How long have we got?
- A very tiny list.

413
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,619
Get your A4 pad.

414
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:16,409
I think that Eddie
would look really manly and hot

415
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:17,618
in uniform.

416
00:27:19,326 --> 00:27:22,743
I mean, morally, I don't agree with
national armies, but still...

417
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:26,451
Super sexy!
- Mm-hm.

418
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:28,534
Thank you, babe.
- Yeah.

419
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:30,034
We're gonna go to my room.

420
00:27:30,618 --> 00:27:32,909
Oh. Uh, yeah, of course.

421
00:27:33,576 --> 00:27:36,493
Oh, do you want some, um...trifle?
Do you want...?

422
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:37,951
I-I can bring it up in...

423
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:39,451
in two cups.

424
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,076
Leave your door open.

425
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:46,533
Don't worry, they haven't had sex yet.
- Jesus Christ.

426
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,075
He's only just fingered her.

427
00:27:55,117 --> 00:27:57,367
Your parents don't seem happy.
- They're fine!

428
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:02,908
Jesus.

429
00:28:03,658 --> 00:28:06,450
This must be what the inside
of your gay brain looks like.

430
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:08,950
No. No, there's nothing gay
about my room!

431
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:10,742
Those are bullet shells.

432
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:12,033
Bullets.

433
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:20,282
Ow! What was that for?

434
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,574
Sorry.

435
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,782
Wanted to distract you
from your parents' shit marriage.

436
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:27,699
You're gonna die a virgin.
- No, I'm not.

437
00:28:27,824 --> 00:28:29,366
Hm, yes, you are.

438
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:30,616
No.

439
00:28:31,324 --> 00:28:32,574
I mean...

440
00:28:33,699 --> 00:28:34,949
I'm not a virgin.

441
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:37,366
Really?

442
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:40,074
With a guy, girl...?

443
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:42,616
Guy.
- A girl? Guy? It was a guy.

444
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:44,949
He was staying
at the caravan park.

445
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:48,616
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

446
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:51,032
What was it like?

447
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:53,281
Awful.

448
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,448
He looked like
he was having a stroke.

449
00:29:13,948 --> 00:29:15,948
I don't think we're missing anything.

450
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:19,740
Not really.

451
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:23,406
Me neither.

452
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:28,530
See you tomorrow?
- Mm-hm.

453
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,697
We should...
- Yeah. We should...

454
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,864
Don't bite me!

455
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,197
Evidence!

456
00:29:48,697 --> 00:29:50,280
Don't-Don't move.

457
00:29:59,196 --> 00:30:01,029
Go on, Eddie, good man.

458
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:05,821
What?

459
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:15,613
No one's saying
Thatcher wasn't horrendous,

460
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:17,613
but think of the arch.

461
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:29,820
Oh, my God!

462
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:38,820
Done your maths?

463
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:41,153
Yeah.
- Same.

464
00:30:42,695 --> 00:30:45,320
I did my maths.
- Oh, yeah.

465
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:00,987
I'm going to live near Camden.

466
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,527
It's where all the punks live.

467
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:07,444
Maybe Hackney.
It's on the Victoria line.

468
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:09,944
Maybe Soho.

469
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:13,777
Probably Soho.

470
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:26,152
Nice.

471
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:39,110
No more popping sweets, ladies.

472
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:41,443
This is it. It's now...

473
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,026
...or never.

474
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:48,985
You can be men
or you can be...telephonists.

475
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:52,860
This isn't knitting club!

476
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:56,651
Come on, Cotter!

477
00:31:58,943 --> 00:32:00,110
Come on, Cian!

478
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:02,818
Fucking let's go, let's go!

479
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:05,860
Faster, faster!
- Get up that hill!

480
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:10,067
Come on, Cotter, move it!

481
00:32:10,192 --> 00:32:13,609
This isn't...crochet for beginners!

482
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:21,234
Come on. Don't give up yet.

483
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,775
Money.

484
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:30,400
Have you got any?

485
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:32,317
Are you serious?

486
00:32:32,442 --> 00:32:36,734
I am not Mother fucking Theresa
for Kildare's hard-up teens!

487
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:39,608
With fucking hard-ons!

488
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:41,858
OK, relax.

489
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:44,649
Jesus.
- I bet Eddie isn't like this.

490
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:46,233
No.
- Um...

491
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:49,274
Here. Take these.

492
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:52,233
No, they're good, I promise.

493
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:54,983
They actually are pretty good.

494
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:58,733
You're barred for a month.

495
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:04,316
We're not doing it in the bushes again.
- What's wrong with them?

496
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:53,272
Uh, do you have a fake ID?
- No.

497
00:33:53,397 --> 00:33:54,689
Well, uh, get one.

498
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:57,189
Don't forget to vote, sir.
Thank you.

499
00:33:57,314 --> 00:33:59,022
What the fuck is this?

500
00:34:01,647 --> 00:34:02,939
You know...

501
00:34:03,939 --> 00:34:08,064
...this is the longest that no one's
called me a lesbian since my dad died.

502
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:11,981
A good week after that
there was just...

503
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:14,397
silence.

504
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:17,605
Almost made it worth it.

505
00:34:19,396 --> 00:34:20,688
Do you miss him?

506
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,855
People think he must've been miserable,

507
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,396
but he wasn't.

508
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:31,521
He always laughed with me and mam.

509
00:34:33,896 --> 00:34:35,438
This place killed him.

510
00:34:36,855 --> 00:34:40,021
If it makes you feel any better,
I think I'm gonna fail the Cadets.

511
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:45,146
Yeah, it's not dead-dad bad,
but still...

512
00:34:49,229 --> 00:34:52,062
For what it's worth,
I think you're fascist enough.

513
00:34:52,395 --> 00:34:53,645
Thanks.

514
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,145
Come on, let's go.

515
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,354
We have school.

516
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:02,687
Oh, fuck it!
We're going to Dublin.

517
00:35:13,854 --> 00:35:15,437
Don't touch me.
- Totally fair.

518
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:37,936
'Next station is Dublin.'

519
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:17,643
Why don't you just skip the Commandos
and come away with me?

520
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,976
What?

521
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:35,976
# I'll always love you

522
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:44,434
# And you can be there

523
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:52,642
# To hug me

524
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:55,726
# Though someone

525
00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:59,391
# That you've met

526
00:37:03,516 --> 00:37:08,891
# Has made you forget

527
00:37:09,016 --> 00:37:12,016
We should probably
stick together so that we...

528
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:15,350
Wha...?
- # You can count

529
00:37:16,225 --> 00:37:19,475
# On me

530
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,725
# Well, I wish

531
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,474
# I wish you success

532
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:33,849
# And loads

533
00:37:35,474 --> 00:37:38,015
# Loads of happiness

534
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,265
# But baby

535
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:45,682
# I got to confess

536
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:53,807
# I'll be lonely

537
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,307
# If you ever

538
00:37:58,182 --> 00:38:01,474
# Oh, if you ever need a friend... #

539
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,598
You OK, baby gay?

540
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:06,889
Do you know me?

541
00:38:07,723 --> 00:38:08,806
No.

542
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:11,056
# Until the end

543
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:14,514
# And you

544
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,264
# Can depend

545
00:38:18,473 --> 00:38:22,639
# On me

546
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:24,473
Hi.
- Hi.

547
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:26,639
I'm Sarah.

548
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,639
I'm not a lesbian.

549
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,806
Yeah.
- Yeah.

550
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:33,389
Sorry, I didn't... I wasn't saying that.
- No, no...

551
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:36,180
I-I'm here with my boyfriend...

552
00:38:37,388 --> 00:38:41,763
...who is usually straighter than that.
- OK.

553
00:38:43,222 --> 00:38:48,222
#But, darling, I've gotta confess

554
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:52,263
# I'm gonna be lonely... #

555
00:38:53,013 --> 00:38:54,430
Oh, shit.

556
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:59,722
# Oh, if you ever

557
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:03,888
# Oh, if you ever need a friend... #

558
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:07,804
Come on, we have to go.

559
00:39:09,054 --> 00:39:11,012
Eddie, this is Sarah.

560
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:14,012
She studies German
at Trinity.

561
00:39:14,512 --> 00:39:18,471
Well, what's the German for
"We're going to miss the last train"?

562
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:23,179
Um...Wir werden den letzten Zug verpassen.

563
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:24,887
Wow.

564
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:30,554
You know, but, you know, you both know
who else spoke German, though.

565
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,679
Hitler.

566
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:35,721
I...

567
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:41,428
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

568
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:46,011
Was that just a...

569
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:48,845
Just a fact or an insult?

570
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:53,136
Uh, honestly, he's not great at either.

571
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:57,761
Fuck.

572
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:03,220
I know it looks like
I'm "obeying my man", but...

573
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:08,095
we really WILL miss the train
and my mam really WILL kill me.

574
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,594
Well... Well...

575
00:40:16,927 --> 00:40:18,219
I'm gonna be at this

576
00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:22,802
on Saturday
if you...happen to be around.

577
00:40:24,052 --> 00:40:25,677
No stress either way, just...

578
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:27,677
Yeah.
- Yeah.

579
00:40:42,802 --> 00:40:44,135
Hey.

580
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:57,301
Uh, your mum just needed some space,
I was...

581
00:40:58,343 --> 00:41:00,509
...snoring too loud again.

582
00:41:06,843 --> 00:41:09,468
Were you with Amber?
- Yeah.

583
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:14,259
Hey, don't worry,
I won't give you a hard time.

584
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:21,383
My dad used to give me
such a bollocking.

585
00:41:22,758 --> 00:41:23,883
Jesus...

586
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:26,425
He was stern, you know?

587
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:29,425
Didn't show emotion.

588
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:34,758
But...that's what
men were like back then.

589
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:37,800
You know, cold. They...

590
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:40,342
...never showed their love.

591
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,466
Where the hell were you?

592
00:42:10,924 --> 00:42:13,132
Nowhere.
- Were you drinking?

593
00:42:13,257 --> 00:42:15,424
I may have had
a little glass of something.

594
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:17,341
What would your father say?

595
00:42:18,424 --> 00:42:21,216
Well, you don't get an opinion
if you kill yourself!

596
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:02,922
It's simple, the thing with girls
is that it's all about eye contact.

597
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,297
You just...stare at them?

598
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,714
Y-You, yeah. Well, no.

599
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,672
Y-You look at them
until you...get their attention.

600
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,380
Just keep looking.
- That's exactly what I do.

601
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:16,755
Yeah, OK.

602
00:43:19,547 --> 00:43:21,505
So, you've never fucked yet?
- Uh...

603
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:23,630
No.

604
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:27,379
Waiting for the right time.
- What's the matter, can't get it up?

605
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,963
At least I have a girlfriend.

606
00:43:29,088 --> 00:43:33,463
Ohhh.
- Well, I've had loads of sex, so...

607
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:35,129
With who?

608
00:43:35,254 --> 00:43:36,504
Ohhh.

609
00:43:36,629 --> 00:43:38,963
Well, it was on...
It was on holiday! So...

610
00:43:39,088 --> 00:43:41,838
Course it was.
- Yeah, it was, actually.

611
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:45,046
Spain, 1993, you heard of it?
No, you wouldn't.

612
00:43:45,171 --> 00:43:48,379
It was great. Shut up! Leave me alone.
Don't look at me like that.

613
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:53,254
I was thinking about what you said.

614
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:56,504
About how the state
just wants to control vaginas?

615
00:43:57,629 --> 00:44:00,503
No, the other, uh, thing.

616
00:44:00,628 --> 00:44:02,628
About me coming to London with you.

617
00:44:03,795 --> 00:44:06,878
Shit, Cotter!
Are you going to defect?

618
00:44:07,003 --> 00:44:10,253
No. No, I'm just...thinking out loud.

619
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:13,587
I mean,
I suppose I can make room, but...

620
00:44:13,712 --> 00:44:16,128
you'd have to pull your weight.
- Fine.

621
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,212
And I don't think
a punk zine is going to pay two wages.

622
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,212
Will it pay one?
- Jesus.

623
00:44:22,337 --> 00:44:24,295
London will eat
your country arse alive.

624
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,587
We've grown up
a quarter of a mile away.

625
00:44:26,712 --> 00:44:29,712
Yeah, but I have a city mentality.

626
00:44:31,128 --> 00:44:33,669
These two are the worst.

627
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:36,419
You know, I...

628
00:44:37,752 --> 00:44:40,127
We should tell people
that we've slept together.

629
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:42,002
What?! Why?

630
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:44,711
Because when you're as passionate
as we are,

631
00:44:44,836 --> 00:44:46,919
it's the most
natural thing in the world.

632
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:49,627
They were saying it this morning.

633
00:44:50,336 --> 00:44:51,586
On one condition.

634
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:55,294
We go to this...on Saturday.

635
00:44:56,127 --> 00:44:58,419
Please.

636
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:02,711
I'll give you the best pretend-orgasm
you've ever had.

637
00:45:03,877 --> 00:45:05,376
And wasn't it cool?

638
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,668
Being TOTALLY anonymous?

639
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,460
Will your mam even let you out?
- Leave that to me.

640
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,460
Do you want to make fun
of their sex noises?

641
00:45:14,585 --> 00:45:17,168
Hey, what the fuck?
- I can't, I have training.

642
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,960
I thought
that you were conscientiously objecting?

643
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:23,043
I promised my dad.
- Ugh.

644
00:45:25,001 --> 00:45:26,001
Bye!

645
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:27,335
Bye!

646
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,085
This is it, son.

647
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,418
No TVs, no VHS, no CDs.

648
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:37,917
Just man time.

649
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,792
Remember, if I wasn't your father,
you'd be dead right now.

650
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:54,500
Why?
- Remember, food is everywhere.

651
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,459
Remember,
if you lose your clothes,

652
00:45:58,417 --> 00:45:59,709
you can make clothes.

653
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:03,334
Remember,
fish are nature's Pot Noodles.

654
00:46:05,209 --> 00:46:06,292
OK.

655
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:24,333
# She's my wild rose

656
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:30,666
# My dark-haired lover

657
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,666
# Dipping her feet

658
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:40,208
# In Sunday seas... #

659
00:46:57,998 --> 00:46:59,415
Hm.

660
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:20,706
Oh, right.

661
00:47:27,706 --> 00:47:29,289
We need to see the play for school.

662
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:33,997
Is that so?

663
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:36,539
Well...

664
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:41,081
It's the difference between an A and a B
and I want an A.

665
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:44,747
I want to make dad proud.
- Oh, Jesus.

666
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:46,913
OK.

667
00:47:48,163 --> 00:47:49,955
Be back by midnight.

668
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,330
I promise.

669
00:48:00,496 --> 00:48:01,580
You have a lovely home.

670
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,830
And now I know you're a liar.

671
00:48:15,788 --> 00:48:16,913
Well...

672
00:48:18,955 --> 00:48:21,079
Come on!
- I...I'm gonna go.

673
00:48:40,954 --> 00:48:42,037
Here.

674
00:48:42,162 --> 00:48:43,870
I got these
instead of a tenner.

675
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:45,704
I dunno, I...

676
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:48,704
I-I don't think
soldiers can take drugs, so...

677
00:48:49,537 --> 00:48:50,537
Yeah.

678
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:53,244
You're thinking of the police.
- Am I?

679
00:48:56,911 --> 00:48:58,911
Hurry the fuck up!

680
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,369
OK.

681
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,410
# Love system, love system

682
00:49:46,535 --> 00:49:48,035
# Gotta get that love system

683
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,285
# Love system, love system... #

684
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:53,535
We're going to take over
the fucking world!

685
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,243
Yeah!
- Yeah!

686
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:57,867
# Love system, love system

687
00:49:57,992 --> 00:49:59,659
# Gotta get that love system... #

688
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:17,076
Amber.

689
00:50:18,992 --> 00:50:22,159
Are you OK?
- Yeah!

690
00:50:29,908 --> 00:50:32,366
I didn't know if you'd come.
- Mm...

691
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:34,283
Well, here I am.

692
00:50:41,616 --> 00:50:43,283
I need to make a confession.

693
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,658
I don't actually have a boyfriend.

694
00:50:48,491 --> 00:50:49,741
Not really.

695
00:50:51,283 --> 00:50:53,991
The whole penis thing
kind of makes me vom.

696
00:50:59,741 --> 00:51:01,491
No, I'm not a fan either.

697
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:04,615
Good.

698
00:51:05,157 --> 00:51:07,949
That's good.

699
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,907
Sorry.

700
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,365
Hi.

701
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,615
What?

702
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,949
Hi!

703
00:51:22,074 --> 00:51:24,407
Hi.
- You a student?

704
00:51:25,407 --> 00:51:26,574
Uh...

705
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:28,865
No, no.

706
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:31,574
No, I'm not.
I'm here with my girlfriend.

707
00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:33,699
She's out there,
we're moving to London.

708
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:36,448
Right. So...

709
00:52:23,863 --> 00:52:25,322
Cian?

710
00:52:25,447 --> 00:52:29,072
Get the fuck off me!
- Jesus, what the fuck is your problem?

711
00:52:32,322 --> 00:52:34,447
Eddie, wait, please.
Eddie. Eddie!

712
00:52:34,572 --> 00:52:36,655
Don't fucking touch me!
- Whoa!

713
00:52:39,321 --> 00:52:40,862
Get the fuck off me!

714
00:52:41,862 --> 00:52:43,487
Shit. Eddie!

715
00:52:43,612 --> 00:52:46,612
Get the fuck off me!
- Leave him alone!

716
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:50,737
Jesus! What the...?

717
00:52:50,862 --> 00:52:52,446
Hate crime!

718
00:52:53,321 --> 00:52:54,321
Fuck!

719
00:52:55,279 --> 00:52:57,279
I am SO sorry.

720
00:53:05,946 --> 00:53:08,571
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

721
00:53:09,571 --> 00:53:10,987
Fuck!

722
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:15,611
OK, OK, OK, OK...

723
00:53:15,736 --> 00:53:18,028
OK. OK...

724
00:53:20,653 --> 00:53:21,945
Eddie!

725
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,778
What the hell was that?!
- Where did you go?!

726
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,236
I was in the other room!

727
00:53:28,361 --> 00:53:31,153
Well, no! No, you weren't!
You just left me alone in there!

728
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:34,320
What happened?!

729
00:53:36,861 --> 00:53:40,403
Hey. Hey. Hey.

730
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:43,320
It's OK.

731
00:53:45,777 --> 00:53:48,402
It's OK. It's OK.

732
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,402
I have you now.

733
00:53:54,944 --> 00:53:56,360
I have you now.

734
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:11,735
I mean, this isn't so bad.

735
00:54:14,194 --> 00:54:15,610
You know, maybe...

736
00:54:17,276 --> 00:54:18,984
Maybe it could be nice.

737
00:54:21,401 --> 00:54:22,818
And maybe...

738
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:26,151
Maybe it could work.

739
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:29,026
Like...

740
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:32,151
Like properly.

741
00:55:14,067 --> 00:55:15,692
What happened last night?

742
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:18,275
You scared the shit out of me.

743
00:55:21,191 --> 00:55:22,607
It was just the drugs.

744
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:37,566
Maybe they didn't even notice.

745
00:55:39,899 --> 00:55:41,399
Fuck.

746
00:55:43,316 --> 00:55:44,691
Double fuck.

747
00:55:46,774 --> 00:55:49,149
Get out of the car. Now!

748
00:55:49,274 --> 00:55:51,774
Mam, I--
- Don't you dare speak!

749
00:55:51,899 --> 00:55:54,940
I don't want your delinquent son
anywhere near my daughter!

750
00:55:55,065 --> 00:55:57,815
Well, I don't want your weird daughter
near my son.

751
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,273
Yeah! I mean, she's actually lovely,
but still, fuck you.

752
00:56:01,398 --> 00:56:03,231
Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

753
00:56:03,356 --> 00:56:05,106
Fuck you!
- Fuck off!

754
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:07,356
Hannah!
- She started it.

755
00:56:10,356 --> 00:56:12,606
Good luck.
- You too.

756
00:56:12,731 --> 00:56:13,565
Get in!

757
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,940
Sorry, mam.

758
00:56:31,647 --> 00:56:33,522
You are in for it now,
young man.

759
00:56:34,064 --> 00:56:35,564
Can I go to my room?

760
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:37,939
Sure.

761
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,064
Good boy.

762
00:56:53,897 --> 00:56:55,439
Are we not going to punish him?

763
00:56:56,147 --> 00:56:59,521
When you're not absent half of the year
then you can have a say.

764
00:57:07,521 --> 00:57:09,604
Do you want a...
Do you want a Winkle?

765
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:21,729
Eddie?

766
00:57:22,771 --> 00:57:23,813
What?

767
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,188
Did you, uh, did you use protection?

768
00:57:28,563 --> 00:57:29,854
Lots of it.

769
00:57:31,103 --> 00:57:32,312
Good. Good.

770
00:57:32,437 --> 00:57:34,812
Cos, uh, you wouldn't want
to get a girl pregnant,

771
00:57:34,937 --> 00:57:38,853
then have to get married too young,
and then get divorced

772
00:57:38,978 --> 00:57:42,187
cos you're fighting,
cos you're away working all the time.

773
00:57:43,062 --> 00:57:44,270
What?

774
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:47,145
Y-You see,
love is like a flame,

775
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,312
it burns you when it's hot.

776
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,770
Where's that from?

777
00:57:52,228 --> 00:57:53,978
I, uh, I heard it in a song.

778
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:05,477
# Our love's gone wrong again

779
00:58:07,686 --> 00:58:11,936
# Our love's gone wrong again

780
00:58:13,977 --> 00:58:16,269
# It seemed so true

781
00:58:16,394 --> 00:58:19,311
# But now I say to you

782
00:58:20,436 --> 00:58:24,352
# Our love's gone wrong again... #

783
00:58:27,269 --> 00:58:30,894
# You shone a light in my eye... #

784
00:58:33,602 --> 00:58:35,810
Hey.

785
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,518
My mam will kill you
if she sees us.

786
00:58:39,476 --> 00:58:40,476
I don't care.

787
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,185
We should take some time.

788
00:58:45,643 --> 00:58:47,935
Just to let my mam cool down.

789
00:58:50,101 --> 00:58:51,226
OK.

790
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:54,726
But just like a few days.

791
00:58:56,893 --> 00:58:58,435
Something like that.

792
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:00,476
OK.

793
00:59:01,851 --> 00:59:03,185
Let's say two days, then.

794
00:59:06,101 --> 00:59:07,685
See you in two days!

795
00:59:11,017 --> 00:59:15,059
# You say you want

796
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:19,225
# Diamonds on a ring of gold

797
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:23,350
# You say you want

798
00:59:23,475 --> 00:59:27,309
# Your story to remain untold

799
00:59:27,434 --> 00:59:31,184
# All the promises we made

800
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:35,100
# From the cradle to the grave

801
00:59:35,225 --> 00:59:39,100
# When all I want

802
00:59:39,225 --> 00:59:42,599
# Is you

803
00:59:43,558 --> 00:59:47,516
# You say you'll give me

804
00:59:47,641 --> 00:59:51,683
# A highway with no one on it

805
00:59:51,808 --> 00:59:55,391
# Treasure just to look upon it

806
00:59:55,516 --> 00:59:59,516
# All the riches in the night #

807
01:00:05,183 --> 01:00:07,724
I heard you and Eddie
are going through a rough patch.

808
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:10,683
Just hang in there.
You two are so in love.

809
01:00:12,058 --> 01:00:13,515
Thanks.
- Come on, babe.

810
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,140
Don't call me babe.
- Fair.

811
01:00:24,265 --> 01:00:25,515
Brian Dermody.
- Here.

812
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,807
Rory O'Connor.
- Here.

813
01:00:26,932 --> 01:00:28,348
Essa O'Riley.
- Here.

814
01:00:28,473 --> 01:00:29,682
Amber Keenan.

815
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:32,098
Eddie, where's Amber?

816
01:00:34,015 --> 01:00:36,098
I... Uh, she's not feeling well.

817
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,473
Is she OK or...?

818
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:42,015
Period stuff.
- OK, thank you very much for that.

819
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,390
Kevin Burn.
- Here.

820
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:44,515
Tracey Brennan.
- Here.

821
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,014
Woody Ferguson.
- Here.

822
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:47,222
Eddie Cotter.
- Here.

823
01:00:48,306 --> 01:00:50,431
We're just pretending to go out.

824
01:00:51,722 --> 01:00:54,056
Just until school is over
and I can get out.

825
01:00:54,181 --> 01:00:55,472
So, he's your beard.

826
01:00:57,389 --> 01:00:58,889
Basically.

827
01:00:59,472 --> 01:01:00,889
Makes sense, I guess.

828
01:01:01,764 --> 01:01:02,806
Does your mam know?

829
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:05,556
Christ, no. God...

830
01:01:06,514 --> 01:01:08,181
She'd order an exorcism.

831
01:01:14,222 --> 01:01:16,681
So, what now?
- Well, let's get out of here.

832
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,887
Hey, Ms Keenan.

833
01:01:54,012 --> 01:01:55,137
Mrs.

834
01:01:55,887 --> 01:01:57,054
Really?

835
01:01:57,679 --> 01:01:59,512
I thought cos your husband's dead...

836
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:02,512
You can keep the Mrs.
- Keep the Mrs. OK.

837
01:02:02,637 --> 01:02:04,262
It's a thing.
- Mm-hm, OK.

838
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,595
Uh, is Amber home?
- No.

839
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,512
She must be off seeing a PLAY
with someone else.

840
01:02:15,595 --> 01:02:20,679
# I just stood there bathed in the quiet, no

841
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:26,428
# You say you'll cut your bangs
I'm calling your bluff

842
01:02:26,553 --> 01:02:31,636
# When you lie to me
it's in the small stuff

843
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:37,219
# You say you'll cut your bangs
I'm calling your bluff

844
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:42,219
# When you lie to me
it's in the small stuff

845
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:47,844
# Now your mouth is foaming
like a rabid dog

846
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:53,136
# And where the river flowed
is now a clouded fog

847
01:02:53,261 --> 01:02:58,843
# Your teeth are gnashing louder
than your monologue

848
01:02:58,968 --> 01:03:04,302
# And I just stood there
bathed in the quiet, no

849
01:03:04,427 --> 01:03:08,843
# You say you'll cut your bangs
I'm calling your bluff

850
01:03:09,885 --> 01:03:14,927
# When you lie to me
it's in the small stuff

851
01:03:15,052 --> 01:03:20,010
# You say you'll cut your bangs
I'm calling your bluff

852
01:03:20,677 --> 01:03:25,343
# When you lie to me
it's in the small stuff #

853
01:03:27,177 --> 01:03:29,634
So...just remember to pace yourself.

854
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:31,967
And never push too hard at the start.

855
01:03:32,717 --> 01:03:35,551
Remember the rabbit and the tortoise.
- And the hare!

856
01:03:36,426 --> 01:03:37,842
The tortoise and the hare.

857
01:03:37,967 --> 01:03:41,342
Yeah, and don't worry about
who's passing you, it's a long game.

858
01:03:44,426 --> 01:03:45,801
Eddie, you...

859
01:03:45,926 --> 01:03:48,509
You know you don't have to do this.
I mean, not...

860
01:03:50,051 --> 01:03:52,301
Not everyone is made for the army.

861
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:54,009
I can do it.

862
01:03:55,551 --> 01:03:57,926
Yes. No, I mean,
I didn't mean it like...

863
01:04:01,258 --> 01:04:02,883
OK, yeah.

864
01:04:03,008 --> 01:04:04,966
You'll be great.

865
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,300
Five minutes!

866
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:17,341
Eddie, stop. We need to talk.
- There's nothing to talk about.

867
01:04:17,466 --> 01:04:20,216
Just don't tell anybody, all right?
- Eddie!

868
01:04:24,883 --> 01:04:27,883
Jesus, I'm gone one day
and you're back to the war machine.

869
01:04:29,091 --> 01:04:30,258
Where were you?

870
01:04:31,091 --> 01:04:32,550
I was sick.

871
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:33,840
Period stuff.

872
01:04:36,965 --> 01:04:38,799
Once your mam calms down,
we can go back to normal.

873
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:41,674
To the way it was.

874
01:04:53,299 --> 01:04:54,340
Let's talk later.

875
01:04:56,215 --> 01:04:57,215
About?

876
01:04:57,715 --> 01:04:58,882
Not now.

877
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,840
Good luck.

878
01:05:03,924 --> 01:05:05,090
I love you.

879
01:05:07,548 --> 01:05:08,881
No one can hear you.

880
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:25,923
That's good, Kelly. Keep it going.
- Faggot.

881
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:28,214
How far up the hole
do you want it?

882
01:05:28,339 --> 01:05:29,881
Move!
- Come on, Cotter.

883
01:05:31,339 --> 01:05:32,673
Come on, move it!

884
01:05:34,881 --> 01:05:36,673
Get up!

885
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:17,129
Hi. Uh...

886
01:06:17,254 --> 01:06:20,837
Look, I was thinking and...I...

887
01:06:21,296 --> 01:06:23,337
I think that maybe we should just...

888
01:06:24,754 --> 01:06:26,921
We should just start
going out properly.

889
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:28,421
What?

890
01:06:29,462 --> 01:06:30,546
No!

891
01:06:31,879 --> 01:06:35,712
Like Jesus, no!
- What? Sh! Why not?

892
01:06:35,837 --> 01:06:37,754
Th-This works, OK, it's perfect.

893
01:06:37,879 --> 01:06:41,129
Eddie, it's not real.
- But it is. It is. No, it is real.

894
01:06:41,254 --> 01:06:45,295
We just... We just...
Yeah, OK, we skip the sex part, OK?

895
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,170
But most couples stop that anyway.

896
01:06:48,586 --> 01:06:53,003
I don't want to skip it!
Like, we shouldn't have to skip it.

897
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,128
Amber, please.

898
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,961
Don't ruin this.

899
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:01,253
I'm sorry, Eddie.

900
01:07:03,503 --> 01:07:04,545
It's over.

901
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:10,836
If you want,
you can tell people you ended it.

902
01:07:13,711 --> 01:07:15,294
That makes sense.

903
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:27,794
Sh. Hey!

904
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:29,835
Why don't we put on some potato waffles?

905
01:07:31,752 --> 01:07:34,002
Amber dumped him.
- No, I-I dumped her!

906
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:38,044
I'm sorry, love.

907
01:07:41,877 --> 01:07:44,710
Look, just remember,
it doesn't matter either way.

908
01:08:03,501 --> 01:08:04,543
I got in.

909
01:08:05,084 --> 01:08:09,043
That's great, honey, that's great.
- Wow. Hey!

910
01:08:10,543 --> 01:08:12,043
Well done.
- Well done.

911
01:08:12,168 --> 01:08:14,709
That's great.
That's good news.

912
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:23,792
Mam.

913
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,042
Please say something.

914
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:33,250
That you're...

915
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:38,083
Gay.

916
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,375
I don't know
what your father would say.

917
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:51,792
He's not here.

918
01:08:53,249 --> 01:08:54,582
It's just us.

919
01:08:58,582 --> 01:09:00,291
I'm not going anywhere.

920
01:09:21,582 --> 01:09:25,331
You're voting for Jesus.
Hey, Eddie, hey! Hey.

921
01:09:27,706 --> 01:09:29,165
Eddie.
- What?

922
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:32,040
Amber... Amber... She's a lesbian.

923
01:09:32,165 --> 01:09:33,540
What?
- Yeah.

924
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:36,456
B-But nobody's saying, nobody...

925
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:43,040
Nobody's saying you made her one.
- Who? Who's saying that?

926
01:09:43,165 --> 01:09:45,206
A few of... Every... That guy.
- He said it?

927
01:09:45,331 --> 01:09:46,790
Yeah.
- Why would he say it?

928
01:09:46,915 --> 01:09:48,665
Like, a lot of people as well.

929
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:50,790
Were you... What?
- But I...

930
01:09:51,831 --> 01:09:53,915
OK. Oh, Jesus.

931
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,165
There, there.

932
01:09:56,290 --> 01:09:57,664
No, no, OK.

933
01:09:57,789 --> 01:09:59,455
OK, OK, OK! Let's go.

934
01:10:00,789 --> 01:10:02,664
Eddie...

935
01:10:20,539 --> 01:10:21,747
Oh, God.

936
01:10:32,163 --> 01:10:33,496
Did you know?

937
01:10:34,829 --> 01:10:35,954
No.

938
01:10:37,288 --> 01:10:39,621
I think she might've
tried it on with me once.

939
01:10:40,621 --> 01:10:43,579
Like...100% did.

940
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:51,329
I'm a good listener.

941
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:54,829
Thanks.

942
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,287
Jesus,
that's the lesbian one, isn't it?

943
01:11:36,577 --> 01:11:38,244
Jesus, am I glad to see you.

944
01:11:39,494 --> 01:11:41,619
My mam told Father Jermidy,

945
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:44,161
but apparently it needs to be
in the actual box

946
01:11:44,286 --> 01:11:45,911
in order to be a confession.

947
01:11:46,036 --> 01:11:47,036
Arsehole.

948
01:11:48,911 --> 01:11:51,452
Eddie.
- Just get the hell out of my way, dyke!

949
01:11:56,369 --> 01:11:57,536
Amber...

950
01:12:08,243 --> 01:12:10,910
Hey, man,
you should really be more sensitive.

951
01:12:11,826 --> 01:12:15,201
Oh, I should really be more sensitive?
You think that?

952
01:12:15,326 --> 01:12:18,326
You, Kev, think that
I should really be more sensitive?!

953
01:12:18,451 --> 01:12:19,576
What the actual fuck?

954
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:22,118
Don't tell me to be more sensitive!

955
01:12:22,243 --> 01:12:23,535
Who, whoa, whoa, whoa.

956
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,326
Kev, you OK?

957
01:12:31,576 --> 01:12:32,951
My office now.

958
01:12:36,326 --> 01:12:37,576
All right, sit down.

959
01:12:41,034 --> 01:12:43,409
What has gotten into you?
This is not like you.

960
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,450
All right, look...

961
01:12:50,534 --> 01:12:52,034
I know how you must feel.

962
01:12:53,242 --> 01:12:55,742
You do?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure I do.

963
01:13:03,034 --> 01:13:04,117
W-What the hell?

964
01:13:04,242 --> 01:13:06,909
Y-You said that you knew how I feel!
- To be a teenager.

965
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:10,367
Shit, I...
- No, I've got a fiancée, I'm straight.

966
01:13:10,492 --> 01:13:13,324
I didn't mean it. I didn't.
- Oh, fuck.

967
01:13:13,449 --> 01:13:16,158
OK, was the door open?
The code says it has to be open.

968
01:13:16,283 --> 01:13:17,449
It was, but I was joking!

969
01:13:17,574 --> 01:13:21,783
You're nearest to the door, I'm not
blocking you. This is a safe space.

970
01:13:21,908 --> 01:13:24,949
The safest. Real safe, so safe.
- A safe place.

971
01:13:25,074 --> 01:13:27,741
But it was a joke, though. I was joking!
- Shit, Eddie!

972
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:29,449
Why did you do that?

973
01:13:29,574 --> 01:13:32,408
I've got a 30-year mortgage
with a lady!

974
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:35,741
With a lady, Eddie. With a lady!
- Just don't tell anyone.

975
01:13:35,866 --> 01:13:39,158
Why did you do that? Why?
- I know, I'm sorry.

976
01:13:39,824 --> 01:13:40,783
Oh, fuck!

977
01:13:50,198 --> 01:13:52,198
Fuck!

978
01:13:53,448 --> 01:13:56,240
Who the fuck
are you calling a dyke?

979
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:58,032
Why did you have to ruin this?

980
01:13:58,157 --> 01:14:00,615
It was never going to last forever!
- But why not?

981
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,073
Because!

982
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:05,740
I want pussy and you want cock,
it is a fundamental obstacle!

983
01:14:05,865 --> 01:14:06,907
Shit!

984
01:14:10,032 --> 01:14:12,157
You can come out too.
- No.

985
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:13,823
No, I'm happy as I am.

986
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,656
So, what,
you just join the regiment

987
01:14:17,781 --> 01:14:20,156
and stay here and be miserable?!

988
01:14:22,739 --> 01:14:24,406
It's better than being a faggot.

989
01:14:27,614 --> 01:14:29,572
It's not about other people, Eddie.

990
01:14:30,364 --> 01:14:31,406
It's about you.

991
01:14:58,571 --> 01:14:59,863
I'm ready to talk.

992
01:15:02,988 --> 01:15:04,613
I assumed you would.

993
01:15:14,446 --> 01:15:15,863
She broke my heart.

994
01:15:20,321 --> 01:15:22,695
She was the first girl
that I ever slept with.

995
01:15:24,237 --> 01:15:25,570
My God.

996
01:15:25,695 --> 01:15:27,612
Lesbians are fierce sluts.

997
01:15:29,779 --> 01:15:31,695
I don't know
if I'll ever love again.

998
01:15:59,486 --> 01:16:00,903
Eddie.

999
01:16:17,653 --> 01:16:18,819
Mam.

1000
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:21,736
This is Sarah.
- Hello, Sarah, nice to meet you.

1001
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:23,361
You too.

1002
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:25,111
Oh!

1003
01:16:28,652 --> 01:16:30,735
Right, so, that's that.

1004
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:36,027
I hope you like chicken Kiev.

1005
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,318
I'm... I'm actually vegetarian.

1006
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:56,527
Amber! Sign my shirt.

1007
01:17:02,734 --> 01:17:05,026
Sorry for all the stick,
but it's in the past now.

1008
01:17:05,651 --> 01:17:07,234
It was last week.
- Ah.

1009
01:17:08,526 --> 01:17:09,776
Exactly.

1010
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:52,733
Oh...

1011
01:17:54,066 --> 01:17:55,108
Shit.

1012
01:17:56,983 --> 01:17:58,275
Was it OK?

1013
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:15,690
My turn.

1014
01:18:41,856 --> 01:18:45,106
Sex, have you heard of it?
Be open about it.

1015
01:18:45,231 --> 01:18:47,314
Will you stop talking about
our sex life?!

1016
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:49,439
You must be open
about these things.

1017
01:18:49,564 --> 01:18:52,314
You were open when I stuck my finger
up your arsehole!

1018
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:54,231
Oh my God, that was one time!

1019
01:18:54,356 --> 01:18:56,981
That was one time!
- Is that even good, though?

1020
01:18:57,106 --> 01:19:00,814
It was actually quite nice,
but that's not the point!

1021
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:02,606
She shouldn't bring that up!

1022
01:19:16,188 --> 01:19:18,813
Drink?
- Uh, yeah...

1023
01:19:20,313 --> 01:19:21,522
Do you want something?

1024
01:19:46,354 --> 01:19:47,729
Just because we feel...

1025
01:19:49,729 --> 01:19:51,104
You know...

1026
01:19:53,062 --> 01:19:54,896
It doesn't mean
that we have to be.

1027
01:19:55,646 --> 01:19:56,646
Right.

1028
01:19:59,562 --> 01:20:01,271
We can just move on.

1029
01:20:03,604 --> 01:20:05,104
And live a normal life.

1030
01:20:07,437 --> 01:20:08,896
We can be happy.

1031
01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:20,478
How's the couch?

1032
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:23,353
It's OK.

1033
01:20:23,895 --> 01:20:25,186
A bit tough on my back.

1034
01:20:30,186 --> 01:20:32,103
Ian, are we shit parents?

1035
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:34,436
No.

1036
01:20:34,978 --> 01:20:36,311
No, I mean...

1037
01:20:36,936 --> 01:20:39,395
I'd say we're in the top 50% maybe.

1038
01:20:40,353 --> 01:20:43,270
It's not that bad, actually.
- No, it's fine.

1039
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:47,894
I'd say there's...much worse.

1040
01:20:48,019 --> 01:20:49,685
Yeah. Yeah...

1041
01:20:53,144 --> 01:20:54,269
OK.

1042
01:20:54,394 --> 01:20:56,144
I'm going to turn down the station.

1043
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,227
I'm not gonna go.

1044
01:21:06,019 --> 01:21:08,102
Hannah, are we gonna get through this?

1045
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:13,144
I dunno.

1046
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:19,393
I hope so.

1047
01:21:20,684 --> 01:21:22,018
I really do.

1048
01:21:44,434 --> 01:21:47,476
How long is Eddie going away for?
- Six weeks.

1049
01:21:47,601 --> 01:21:49,393
He'll be all buff and sexy.

1050
01:21:49,518 --> 01:21:52,517
Once he's done, we can get
a place in the barracks for nothing.

1051
01:21:52,642 --> 01:21:54,308
Jesus, a soldier's wife.

1052
01:21:54,433 --> 01:21:56,975
Has he gone already?
- Can you shampoo Mr Keller.

1053
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,350
Did you just...?

1054
01:21:58,475 --> 01:22:00,308
You missed your shot.
- Exactly.

1055
01:22:00,433 --> 01:22:01,267
When's he going?

1056
01:22:01,392 --> 01:22:02,808
Today.
- None of your bus...

1057
01:22:02,933 --> 01:22:04,933
None of your business.
- I need help here.

1058
01:22:05,058 --> 01:22:07,850
We're on a smoke break.
- Fucking idiot.

1059
01:22:12,433 --> 01:22:13,517
How are you getting on?

1060
01:22:14,433 --> 01:22:15,433
Nearly done.

1061
01:22:26,682 --> 01:22:28,224
I remember when you were tiny.

1062
01:22:29,266 --> 01:22:31,141
I used to have to sit here all night

1063
01:22:31,266 --> 01:22:32,932
and watch you fall asleep.

1064
01:22:33,057 --> 01:22:35,307
It couldn't be your dad,
it had to be me.

1065
01:22:38,057 --> 01:22:40,266
Your dad brought up
this old armchair

1066
01:22:40,391 --> 01:22:44,016
so I could be a bit more comfortable
and...I would just...

1067
01:22:45,307 --> 01:22:46,391
...watch you sleep.

1068
01:22:47,724 --> 01:22:49,099
Night after night.

1069
01:22:52,516 --> 01:22:54,349
You were so beautiful.

1070
01:23:00,015 --> 01:23:02,598
You know
you can tell me...anything.

1071
01:23:03,848 --> 01:23:05,390
Right?

1072
01:23:05,515 --> 01:23:08,015
And I will love you
no matter what.

1073
01:23:13,348 --> 01:23:16,015
I know.

1074
01:23:18,681 --> 01:23:19,765
OK.

1075
01:23:21,848 --> 01:23:23,390
Well, you ready?

1076
01:23:51,889 --> 01:23:53,722
OK.

1077
01:23:53,847 --> 01:23:55,555
OK, you have everything?
- Yeah.

1078
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,222
Phone card?
- Yeah.

1079
01:23:57,347 --> 01:23:59,389
Make sure to ring us, yeah?
- Promise.

1080
01:24:10,096 --> 01:24:11,804
I'm so proud of you.

1081
01:24:12,638 --> 01:24:15,596
Forty minutes.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1082
01:24:40,845 --> 01:24:43,553
So...
Are you gonna let us in or...?

1083
01:24:45,387 --> 01:24:46,595
No.

1084
01:25:07,052 --> 01:25:10,552
Sign your name.
Take your bag. Get on the truck.

1085
01:25:14,094 --> 01:25:15,594
Have you signed your name?

1086
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:19,136
Sign your name.
Take your bag. Get on the truck.

1087
01:25:28,094 --> 01:25:30,136
Bus is moving in five minutes!

1088
01:25:30,261 --> 01:25:32,969
Everybody, get on the trucks
right behind me!

1089
01:25:47,176 --> 01:25:48,801
Stop throwing rocks at people!

1090
01:25:49,718 --> 01:25:50,926
Here.

1091
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:55,760
Why?
- Take it!

1092
01:25:56,593 --> 01:25:59,510
It's over 2,000,
it is enough to get out of here.

1093
01:25:59,635 --> 01:26:00,676
Out of Ireland.

1094
01:26:00,801 --> 01:26:02,510
No, I don't want it.
- Yes, you do!

1095
01:26:02,635 --> 01:26:04,051
I'm happy here.
- You're not!

1096
01:26:04,176 --> 01:26:05,760
I am.
- No, you're not!

1097
01:26:06,468 --> 01:26:08,218
And you're not going to be!

1098
01:26:10,343 --> 01:26:11,967
This place will kill you.

1099
01:26:15,884 --> 01:26:17,717
Please, Eddie, just take it.

1100
01:26:18,675 --> 01:26:21,175
You can't be
who you need to be here.

1101
01:26:25,842 --> 01:26:27,425
Where am I supposed to go?

1102
01:26:29,175 --> 01:26:30,425
Anywhere.

1103
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:34,092
You should come with me.

1104
01:26:36,384 --> 01:26:37,675
I can't.

1105
01:26:40,009 --> 01:26:41,925
You have to do this
on your own.

1106
01:26:43,591 --> 01:26:44,966
I'm scared.

1107
01:26:45,716 --> 01:26:46,883
You should be.

1108
01:26:47,633 --> 01:26:49,091
Fucking scary.

1109
01:26:52,216 --> 01:26:53,591
You'll be great.

1110
01:26:54,966 --> 01:26:56,299
I taught you well.

1111
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:02,466
I can't.

1112
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,758
I can't.

1113
01:27:13,216 --> 01:27:15,673
Come on, move!
The truck is leaving!

1114
01:27:15,798 --> 01:27:17,132
Last call!

1115
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:18,632
Amber...

1116
01:27:32,673 --> 01:27:33,923
I'm gay.

1117
01:27:39,923 --> 01:27:40,965
No shit

1118
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,673
I'm sorry
I was such a prick to you.

1119
01:27:46,007 --> 01:27:47,090
No.

1120
01:27:51,339 --> 01:27:55,214
You are the ONLY boy in the world
I'm glad I dated.

1121
01:27:56,589 --> 01:27:57,881
Go.

1122
01:29:52,919 --> 01:29:56,003
# Do you remember when it seemed

1123
01:29:56,128 --> 01:29:59,335
# That your dreams could be so real

1124
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:02,668
# Do you remember when you believed

1125
01:30:02,793 --> 01:30:06,043
# In everything that you could achieve

1126
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:09,418
# Now you've lost that look in your eye

1127
01:30:09,543 --> 01:30:12,793
# And you don't hold your head so high

1128
01:30:12,918 --> 01:30:15,918
# Precious memory all around

1129
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:19,377
# Don't let them shoot you,
shoot you down

1130
01:30:19,502 --> 01:30:22,710
# Don't let them shoot you,
shoot you down

1131
01:30:22,835 --> 01:30:26,043
# Don't let them shoot you,
shoot you down... #

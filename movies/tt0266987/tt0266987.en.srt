1
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,927
You got maybe seven minutes.

2
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,578
Six minutes.

3
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,564
Almost got one
of the fuses fixed.

4
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,371
Thirty seconds.

5
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,513
Get out now.

6
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,825
Yeah.
It's Duncan.
What are you doing at home?

7
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:57,371
- Jogging.
- How long does it take you
to get to work?

8
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,706
Harry, what time is it there?
How long?

9
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,210
Thirty, 40 minutes. Why?
I'll give you 25 minutes...

10
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:07,089
before I transmit, if you want
to see the cable before they do,

11
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,049
you'd better hustle.

12
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,534
Duncan.
What the hell's goin' on?

13
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,412
Read the cable.
Look, if I'm walking
into a shitstorm,

14
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,414
I've gotta know which way
the wind's blowing.

15
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:44,585
Boy Scout's in trouble.
What kind of trouble?

16
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:47,129
Where are you calling from?

17
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:52,050
Are you in your car?
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

18
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,219
He's a big boy.
He can take care
of himself.

19
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,680
You call me from secure
when you get there.

20
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,959
Let's see
your driver's license.

21
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,237
Sorry, sir.

22
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,948
You need to come
to the desk with me, please.

23
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,450
Mr. Muir.

24
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,497
Duty roster has you
checking out tonight.

25
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,833
Just a reminder:
on your way out,

26
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,085
we need to sign out
your I.D., card key,
parking pass.

27
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,003
It's a date.

28
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,726
You got a cable
from Hong Kong?

29
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,937
You check
the operations center?

30
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,106
I go up there, Billy Nyland's
gonna want to collect...

31
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,358
that hundred I owe him
from the 'Skins game.

32
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,653
Come on, Henry.
Pull it off the mainframe
for me, will you?

33
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,697
My last day.

34
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,264
Gladys.

35
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,021
Cubans are in
the drawer on the left.

36
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:19,573
If these walls could talk, huh?
All this history. I envy you.

37
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:24,745
Bag your job.
You can be just like me.
No, really.

38
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,497
The debt this country
owes you guys.

39
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,874
Chuck, are we gonna
dance all night with
your hand on my ass,

40
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,710
or are you gonna
make your move?

41
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,755
You used to run
an agent named Bishop.

42
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,591
Tom Bishop. Yeah. How is he?
We'd like to take a look at his files.

43
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,551
Did you try Records?

44
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:43,180
Of course, we have his main files.
It was your personals.

45
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:47,351
What do you want to know?
We'll have your Bishop
op reports downloaded...

46
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,604
and sorted in an hour or two;
for now, I'll just take your files.

47
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,733
Grab yourself a seat and
make yourself comfortable.

48
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,195
It's gonna take me a while
to dig 'em up.

49
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,197
Call my office as soon as
you have 'em. ASAP.

50
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,698
Oh, Muir?

51
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,492
Good luck
with the retirement.

52
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:46,827
The director sent this down.
Actually, it looks like
he signed it himself.

53
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:55,669
Oh, and Harker said
I?m supposed to collect
all your files on Tom Bishop.

54
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,639
Finally get to use
one of these burn bags.

55
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,104
Hold this, till
you hear otherwise.

56
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:18,483
You didn't see what I put in.
Are we feeling a little
paranoid on our last day?

57
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:22,196
When did Noah
build the ark, Gladys?

58
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,449
Before the rain.
Before the rain.

59
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,340
Hey, Billy,
you got my hundred?

60
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,682
Harker said to bring
this file up. You want
to buzz me through?

61
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,602
No, I can't, sir.
But I'll make sure
he gets it.

62
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,647
Sir?

63
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,865
Can you get that
Chinese translator?

64
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,625
No, that looks
pretty good.

65
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,878
Looks good.
...as for the upcoming trade
negotiations in the Far East,

66
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,923
a team of negotiators has been
working with the Chinese...

67
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,925
in an effort to streamline
the proceedings...

68
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,177
and lay the groundwork for
the President's trip next week.

69
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,096
In other world news...
Jeez.

70
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,683
now that the Cold War
is finally over, Berliners
are proclaiming a new era...

71
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,519
here where
Soviet and American tanks
faced each other...

72
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,271
in the darkest days
of the Communist...

73
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,650
Is this it?
It's all I could find.

74
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:45,237
Packed, misplaced you know how it is.
Moving day and all.

75
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,240
It's probably
mostly up here anyway.

76
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,367
Old school,
you know?

77
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,789
Muir?

78
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,209
Step this way?

79
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,633
Sit down here, please,
Muir?

80
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:10,304
Jesus, Aiken.
How long has it been?

81
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:17,227
This task force
have a name?

82
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,444
This is a tough one, Troy.

83
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,239
I'm gonna
see you later.

84
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:31,909
You got it, Cy.

85
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,924
Good to see you.
Thanks for stoppin' by.

86
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,176
For the record, we've
been joined by Nathan Muir,
Near East ops.

87
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,472
We're in the process
of dealing...

88
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,725
with a fairly specific...

89
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,394
international flap.

90
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,855
We brought you in here
as a stopgap.

91
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,275
Fill in a few holes for us.
So I'm like
the little Dutch boy, huh?

92
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,902
Yeah!

93
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,738
We just need you
to be a team player
on this one, Muir.

94
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,741
Why is that funny?

95
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:16,119
Every time my coach
told me that, I knew
I was about to get benched.

96
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:21,875
Due to the nature
of this task force, Nathan,

97
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,379
there will be
certain information which
you don't need to know.

98
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:29,049
A week ago, Tom Bishop
disappeared in Hong Kong.

99
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,760
Last night he turned up
outside Shanghai.

100
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:35,764
He's been arrested
for espionage.

101
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:40,227
We're working up a profile
based on relevant personal
histories and op records.

102
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,314
This has to be handled
with kid gloves.

103
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,733
How long does the president
have to claim him?

104
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,944
Twenty-four hours.
Starting when?

105
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,821
As of now, Nathan.

106
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,327
Bishop has been classified
as a common criminal,

107
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,873
and will be executed
at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow
morning, our time.

108
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,628
What about the press?

109
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:09,798
Why not leak it and throw
the spotlight on China,
and buy us some time?

110
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:12,718
We need the press on this
like we need a third teat.

111
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,598
You using the other two?

112
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:21,351
We don't want outside influences
to... limit our options.

113
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,521
What was Bishop
doing in China?

114
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,815
He was with an operation
for Harry Duncan.

115
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,817
Was?
Yes.

116
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,986
Until he took matters
into his own hands.

117
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,238
Well, where are they
holding him?

118
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:37,367
Oh, I'm sorry, Nathan.
It would be nice to know
what gaps are filled.

119
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:38,869
I've only got ten fingers
here, you know?

120
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,667
I guess, kind of
tough timing, hmm?

121
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,336
A week before
the president's road trip.

122
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:51,089
You guys afraid there's gonna
be a congressional hearing?

123
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,721
That's why we're transcribing
and videotaping. Right?

124
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,769
Are you gonna
want me to testify?

125
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,022
No.
No?

126
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,982
Absolutely not.

127
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:16,865
You met Bishop in Vietnam, right?
Yeah.

128
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:20,160
Spring of'75.

129
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,831
Hue had just fallen. Danang
would go in a couple of days.

130
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,667
And I had flown in country
to get an ARVN sniper...

131
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,545
who?d been with us
throughout the Phoenix program.

132
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,631
He was a heavy hitter
named Binh.

133
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,190
Spent the last year
Rocky Mountain way

134
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,529
It's time to open fire

135
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:59,575
And we don't need
the ladies

136
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:03,662
Cryin' 'cause the story?s sad

137
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,792
I got some bad news
for you, sir. he's dead.
Dead?

138
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:13,255
Just before dawn.
Caught a mortar round
with his teeth.

139
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,967
Got anybody else?
There's a staff sergeant
came my way a while back,

140
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,469
but he's nowhere near
Binh's 40 confirmed.
How many has he got?

141
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:22,431
Three kills.
Christ, and that's
the best you got?

142
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,558
He's a fine shot, sir.

143
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,602
Where is he?
Right over there.

144
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,273
Where, in the back?
Yeah.

145
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:35,027
There is another guy,
20 kills, but he's
at least two days away.

146
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,571
Confirm that for me?
Yes, sir.

147
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,573
Why ice over there?
They live separate...

148
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,951
from the other men,
cook their own food-gook food.

149
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,414
Smells awful, sir.

150
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:50,042
Not to the enemy.
Send him in.

151
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,919
Yes, sir.

152
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:05,516
Yes, sir?
Bishop?

153
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,184
That's correct, sir.

154
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,231
Where are you from?
Hemet, California, sir.

155
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,066
Here.
Have a seat.

156
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:22,491
I take it you didn't get
to be a marksman putting food
on your mama's table.

157
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:26,370
No, sir, we have
a Safeway back home.

158
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:29,456
Where'd you learn
to shoot?
Boy Scouts, sir.

159
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,753
Are you kiddin' me?
No, sir.

160
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,633
When did you get
pulled in?
I volunteered, sir.

161
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:44,805
He came across as one of
those idealistic types...

162
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,932
you know, a little bit
of an attitude?

163
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,768
Starts out trying
to see what he's made of, and
ends up not liking the view.

164
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:55,107
Who was the target, Muir?
General Hun Chea.

165
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,943
He's Laotian?
Yeah.
Unofficial enemy.

166
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,779
Code name:
Red Shirt.

167
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,782
He's responsible for
the western flank of
the upcoming Saigon offensive.

168
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,868
His name...
Don't need
a name, sir.

169
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,620
You don't need it?
Or you don't want it?

170
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:12,040
Yeah, I'll do it, sir.

171
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,296
Okay.

172
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,141
The target will be
at a location...

173
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,852
twenty-one clicks away,
tomorrow morning at 0900.

174
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,315
It's a high-powered meet-and-greet
with the Vietcong.

175
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:46,283
Will he be alone, sir?
He sometimes travels
with a bit of an entourage.

176
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,537
''A bit of an entourage?''

177
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:05,844
Red Shirt located.
Do you have in sight?
Red Shirt confirmed.

178
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:14,394
Niner-eight-zero to gate.

179
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,152
One-zero-zero-five
to table.

180
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,408
Wind...

181
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:31,745
five miles left.

182
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,750
Target in sight.

183
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,058
Bravo Six, Bravo Six.
Delta Two. Over.

184
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,894
Go, Delta Two.
We have target in sight,
but no shot.

185
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:59,064
Say again?
No shot.

186
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:02,401
Helo is obstructing target.
Helo? NVA doesn't have air support.

187
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:06,738
Position in jeopardy.
Our position is compromised.
Over.

188
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:10,075
Say it again. Over?
Shh. We're still a go.

189
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,953
We have no go.

190
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,248
Clear.
Don't take the shot!

191
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,417
See if you can
get 'em back.

192
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,128
Delta Two, Delta Two...

193
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:25,924
Move!

194
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:39,646
Come on, come on.

195
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,002
Delta Two, Delta Two.
Bravo Six, over.

196
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,720
Sorry about your man,
Captain.

197
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,598
You want to make
another pass, sir?

198
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:53,071
Hold it.
Go back again.

199
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:13,008
Hell of an ad
for the Boy Scouts.

200
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,058
Did you have
a presidential finding
authorizing those kills?

201
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:29,816
I don't believe
we've met.

202
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,028
Who are you?
Dr. William Byars.

203
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,738
National Security Council.

204
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:40,536
Was there
a finding, Muir?

205
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,288
Well, we were in a place
we weren't supposed to be,

206
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:46,875
assassinating a general
from a country we weren't
at war with...

207
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:50,087
of course, we weren't
officially at war
with North Vietnam, either...

208
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,340
Is that a ''no''?
Oh, come on, guys.

209
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,802
We're on the clock.
The president admits
Bishop is ours,

210
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:01,056
denies he's a spy,
we put out the fires
and negotiate a deal.

211
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,474
Unless I'm
missing something.

212
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,518
Muir's secretary's on...

213
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:08,897
Mm. This will just take a second.

214
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,942
Stop recording.
Stop tape.

215
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,237
Your secretary's got
your wife on the line.
She says it's urgent.

216
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,115
Go ahead.
Want to take it outside?

217
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,577
No, no.
I'll take it in here.
That's fine.

218
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:27,332
Hello?
Got your message.
You want me to start a fire yet?

219
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:31,086
Oh, uh, right.
This'll just take a second.

220
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,715
Right.
Tell you what.

221
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,926
Why don't you hold
that reservation, and, uh,

222
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,803
we may still
be able to use it.

223
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:42,514
You might just.
As we speak, there are
three guys rummaging...

224
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:45,851
through everything
I spent a week packing.

225
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,769
Uh-huh.

226
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:49,479
Okay.

227
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,190
Uh-huh.

228
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:54,026
If there were any instances
of personal dysfunction,
Right.

229
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:58,614
emotional or psychological,
it could be helpful.
Okay.

230
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,782
it?s insubstantial.
Right.

231
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,285
Mm-hmm. Okay.

232
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,287
That'll be good.
Because presidential findings...

233
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,956
have no real importance.
You still there?

234
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,625
Y-Yeah.

235
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,961
So he was an assassin,
recruited to kill.

236
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:17,174
Sounds good.
Bye-bye.

237
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:25,516
Sorry. Wife planning
a retirement dinner.

238
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,269
Assassin?

239
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,901
I think I just
figured it out.

240
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:39,696
The Bishop files.
Where?

241
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,407
My office.
Closet.

242
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:44,827
It'll just
take a second.

243
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,995
I'll send
a security officer down.
No, hey, you guys...

244
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:51,542
have better things to do
than to rummage through
my office, right, Chuck?

245
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,428
He's on his way down.

246
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:40,591
You were right.

247
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,718
It rained.

248
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,137
What about these?

249
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,558
Burn 'em.
What is this about?

250
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,060
Money.

251
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:54,062
Free trade. Microchips.

252
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,732
Toaster ovens.

253
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:58,817
And what does that
have to do with you?

254
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:04,198
Nothing. Get me
Digger Gibson's number.

255
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:09,536
Shit!

256
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:24,009
Agency's looking for
a reason to let the Chinese
kill Tom Bishop.

257
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:42,361
No!

258
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:53,539
Ah, they shut down
my secure line...
last day and all.

259
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:55,332
Can I use yours?
Thanks.
Aw, well...

260
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,418
Oh, I'm sorry. It's classified.
Do you mind?

261
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:00,671
Oh! Uh, right.

262
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:08,595
There's nothing there.
It's not in English?

263
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,598
It's not in English either.
This fax just came in
a few moments ago, sir.

264
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,642
Yeah.

265
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:19,940
So, sir, you and Muir
came up together, right?
Mm.

266
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,318
How well do you know him?
No one knows Nathan.
Not really.

267
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:27,114
Do you trust him?
He's a man who
got the job done.

268
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:29,449
Is he on the job now?

269
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,452
Office of Security, Hong Kong.
Ten to seven this morning,

270
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:35,873
a call originated from
station to Muir's home.

271
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,210
He knew about Bishop
before he got here.
And he played dumb.

272
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:43,213
Yeah, this is Harker.
I need confirmation
on all calls...

273
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:46,049
in and out of
Nathan Muir's office.

274
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:50,345
Gee, I'm hungry.

275
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:53,599
Hong Kong Herald.

276
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:56,727
Digger Gibson, please.
One moment, sir.

277
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:00,814
Hello?
Gibby, old boy.

278
00:33:00,898 --> 00:33:03,192
Nathan!
To what do I owe
this honour?

279
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:05,194
Still have contacts at CNN?

280
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:07,196
I got something for you.
Talk to me.

281
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,325
How about
''C.I.A. operative caught
in the act of espionage''?

282
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:14,620
Can you get that on the air?
That's not gonna be easy.

283
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:16,788
Come on, Gibby.

284
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:19,958
That's never stopped you before.

285
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:22,085
Give me 30 minutes.
Yeah.

286
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:30,969
I remember seeing
something about Bishop
in my South American box,

287
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:32,971
but it wasn't there.

288
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:36,475
Those op files
downloaded yet?

289
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,941
Let's go with this.
Bishop's recruitment.
Yeah.

290
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,152
Well, back then,
recruitment took time.

291
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:50,823
Bishop was evacuated
with the last of them
on the 30th of April,

292
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:55,202
and that gave me a month
to do my homework.

293
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:58,455
I talked to his neighbours,
his teachers, his mom...

294
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,124
scoutmaster...

295
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,961
Pulled his dad's records
from the Pentagon.

296
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:07,923
Then started to move
some pieces around
on the board.

297
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:12,678
And my plan was
to isolate and alienate.

298
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:17,683
Your valleys and your farms

299
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:20,477
I had his C. O. give him
just menial duties...

300
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,771
with non-English-speaking
personnel.

301
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:26,108
And I kept him in limbo about
even the possibility of going home.

302
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:29,862
And then I watched...
and waited.

303
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:32,030
This consignment is
a complete misdirect.

304
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:35,576
It needs to go to
Military H.Q in Mannheim.
You understand?

305
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:44,001
Then, in December, when
I didn't think he could
take anymore,

306
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:49,631
I made the move.
These mist-covered mountains

307
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:55,137
Are a home now to me

308
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,056
There she is.

309
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,019
But my home is the lowlands

310
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:08,609
Uh, sorry sir. It's Bishop.
Sergeant Bishop?

311
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,652
Oh, Christ.
Of course!

312
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,654
Hi.
Yeah, hi.

313
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:14,740
Sandy, this is Tom Bishop.
Tom, right?

314
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,075
Yes, sir. Tom, sir.
Tom. How are you?
Nice to meet you.

315
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,203
Sandy?
My second wife.

316
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:22,748
Second wife?
He asked me what
I was doing in Berlin,

317
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:25,501
and I told him I was there
as a military liaison of a sort.

318
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:29,421
It's good to hear an American
voice again, I'll tell you that.
I'll bet, I'll bet.

319
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,882
What are you doing
for Christmas?

320
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:34,301
No plans.

321
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:38,138
Oh, the weather outside
is frightful

322
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:40,390
But the fire is so delightful

323
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:49,566
Central Intelligence?
Train you as an agent.

324
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,568
You'd be working for me.
Mostly undercover.

325
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:57,533
Europe?
Wherever the action is.

326
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:00,327
What if I preferred...
to just go home?

327
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,205
That's okay.
It's fine.

328
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:06,708
I can probably make arrangements
for you to end your
tour of duty in San Diego.

329
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:10,045
In which case,
I'll presume you'll forget
we ever had this conversation.

330
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:14,049
But look,
it's your choice.

331
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:17,094
All the way home
I'll be warm

332
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,680
The next day,
we started his tradecraft.

333
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,724
The technology
gets better every day,
and that's fine.

334
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:26,603
But most of the time,
all you need is a stick of gum,
a pocket knife and a smile.

335
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:28,772
That's disappointing.
Guten Morgen, meine Herren.

336
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:31,817
Today we're going to be
discussing a radio set.

337
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,612
Not just any radio set,
but a Russian radio set.

338
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:40,784
Every building, every room,
every situation is a snapshot.

339
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:44,830
While I'm sitting here talking
to you, I?m also checking
the room, memorizing it.

340
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:47,791
The people.
What they're wearing.
Then I ask the question,

341
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,627
''What's wrong with this
picture? Anything suspect?''

342
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,046
You've gotta see it,
assess it and dismiss
most of it...

343
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,216
without looking, without thinking.
Without thinking?

344
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,968
It?s just like breathing.
You breathe, don't you?

345
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:04,683
Always carry cigarettes
and a lighter too.
Great ice-breaker.

346
00:37:06,185 --> 00:37:08,187
Eine Kaffee, bitte.
Zwei.

347
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:12,232
Okay, I want you to listen,
but I want your concentration
to be on something different.

348
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,735
Anything else, so you
don't react. Understand?

349
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,612
Yes.

350
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,780
So when do I get
my first assignment?

351
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,782
When I decide
you're ready.

352
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:23,202
What is your name?
Michael Sandville.

353
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:27,164
The suit in the kitchen.

354
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:31,668
Threat?
Wait, how'd you see that? Ah!

355
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,632
See that apartment building?
Yeah?

356
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:39,092
Know anyone
who lives there?
No.

357
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:42,429
Within five minutes,
I want to see you standing
on one of those balconies.

358
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:44,473
Come on.

359
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:47,184
Did you serve in Vietnam?
No, I did not.

360
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,978
Favourite colour?
Why don't we discuss it over coffee?

361
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:52,564
You just lost ten seconds.

362
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:02,115
Solicit information
from someone.

363
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,703
Gladly.

364
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,876
The guy reading the menu.

365
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,712
Don't look at him.

366
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:18,090
He wasn't reading the menu.
He's not reading at all. Threat?

367
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,802
Only to the hostess.

368
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:24,388
You just gave her four pieces
of personal information...

369
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:26,139
for one dubious,
impersonal fact.

370
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:28,475
Just trying to find out
where she got that dress.

371
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,185
Where are you from?
When's your birthday?

372
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:32,646
You know everything
about me. I don't know
a thing about you.

373
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,816
Okay, what did you tell her?

374
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,734
One, you're straight.
Two, you're engaged.

375
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:41,238
Three, tomorrow's your girl's
birthday, and four, you have
no taste in women's fashions.

376
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:44,908
What if she
were an asset?

377
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,954
You told her four lies
that now have to be true.
Okay.

378
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:17,191
I thought spies drank martinis.
Scotch, never less
than 12 years old.

379
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:19,776
Is that right?

380
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:24,948
Agency rules?
My rules.

381
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:27,618
All right, so what else?
What else do I need to know?

382
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:31,788
Put away some money
so you can die someplace warm.

383
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:35,959
Don't ever touch it.
Not for anyone. Ever.

384
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:39,421
Okay.
Is that it?

385
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,094
Don't ever risk your life
or your career for an asset.

386
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:50,140
If it comes down to
you or them, send flowers.

387
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:56,563
He was a natural.

388
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,982
He could take an
East German who had
just come over the Wall,

389
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:02,486
look him straight in the eye,
and ask him to go back...

390
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,279
to the place he just fled
and spy for us.

391
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:16,291
He got so good at it he could
close in a single afternoon,
send the guy out with a smile.

392
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:21,255
Let me get this straight:
you allowed a contract agent
to develop assets?

393
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:24,466
He was that good.
I thought he'd make
a fine case officer someday.

394
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,052
Let's get on with it.
I'd like to hear whatever
you can offer about...

395
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:30,389
Operation Rodeo.
Rodeo?

396
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:39,523
Hold transcription, hold tape.
I'll be right back.

397
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:03,005
You know, this would go
a lot faster, you guys,

398
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:05,174
if you?d tell me
a little something
about the op.

399
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,593
What's it called?
Sideshow?

400
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:10,929
What about it?

401
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:17,936
- How'd you come by this information?
- Just stuff we learn in the field.

402
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:26,653
Sorry about that.
Okay, where were we?

403
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:28,530
I think we were
talking about...

404
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:30,866
Operation Rodeo...
right, Chuck?

405
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:34,703
You're on.

406
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:38,081
My East German contacts...

407
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:43,629
discovered that we had
an unidentified mole in the embassy.

408
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:46,798
We had the ambassador
in our crosshairs,

409
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:49,718
until some information
leaked when he was
out of the country.

410
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:52,804
So that just left
one possibility.

411
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:54,556
Ah, Ann.
Hello.

412
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,101
Ann...
...Cathcart.
Yeah.

413
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:01,396
Bishop was involved
in a small but integral
part of the operation...

414
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,567
going East to bring across
an East German functionary
named Schmidt.

415
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,736
Ready?
Yeah.

416
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:21,667
Ah, fuck!

417
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,170
The passport's in the glove box.
There's some vodka.
Spill it on your coat.

418
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:28,590
If they stop us,
don't say a word.
Remember, you're drunk.

419
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:32,970
And where is Mrs. Muir?
Patricia left me
and filed for divorce.

420
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:36,306
Oh, I'm so sorry, Nathan.

421
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,433
How is it I always
say the wrong things?

422
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:40,936
Patricia?

423
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:43,272
Yeah, my third wife.

424
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:47,109
My God, how many wives
have you had?
Four.

425
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:50,487
You want to hear
about them, or Bishop?

426
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:56,410
You see that gentleman?
Yeah?

427
00:42:56,493 --> 00:43:00,164
He's the ambassador.
Why don't you go over there
and say hello to him?

428
00:43:00,247 --> 00:43:02,166
Okay.
Okay?

429
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:06,545
Your scotch is older
than she is.

430
00:43:06,628 --> 00:43:09,298
Am I supposed to
feel bad about that?

431
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:18,182
They know.

432
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:21,185
They have my family
already, I know it.

433
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:23,187
If they knew, they would
have stopped us.

434
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,314
Tomorrow, your wife, your kids,
will all be safe in Munich.

435
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,483
I gotta make a stop.
What?

436
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:31,778
It's a scheduled stop.
I gotta make a phone call.
They follow you.

437
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:33,989
Friedrich, it's all
taken care of, okay?

438
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:36,033
If they ask, tell 'em
I got sick.

439
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:48,712
Why don't we go outside?
I'm sure we won't be missed.

440
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,340
I wish I could.

441
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,300
I have to stay
near the phone.

442
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:55,385
Working on
a Saturday night?

443
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:08,816
Are you bringing
someone across?

444
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:26,708
Bitte.

445
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,346
Yes?
Vodka did me in.
I'm comin' home.

446
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,056
Throw out the bottle.
Repeat that?

447
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:42,891
Throw out the bottle.
They know.

448
00:44:42,975 --> 00:44:45,102
They don't know.
They don't fuckin' know.

449
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:47,855
They'll be waiting.
Drop as close to checkpoint
as possible.

450
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:51,358
Negative, we're comin' across.
No. That's an order.

451
00:44:57,114 --> 00:44:59,658
Let him go.
They will kill him.

452
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:26,995
Change of plans,
Friedrich.

453
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,336
No.

454
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:37,631
You will drive me across,
just as you said.

455
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:40,592
If I do that,
they'll kill us both.

456
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:43,762
This way, we still
have a chance.
You're a liar.

457
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:49,268
This way, you still
have a chance.
I can't help you.

458
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:53,230
- Just get out of the car.
- I will not get out.

459
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:55,816
Get out of the car! Get out!
I will not get out!

460
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:58,735
I will not!
No! No! No!

461
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:02,281
No!

462
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:08,078
Get out.
Get out!

463
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:11,415
Please.
My wife. My children.

464
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:13,250
I can't help you!

465
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:13,435
Nathan, what happened?
What went wrong?

466
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:15,437
Nothing.
Nothing?

467
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:18,857
Actually, one thing.

468
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:20,859
Don't ever question me again.
Ever.

469
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:22,903
What?
I gave you an order,
you take it.

470
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:27,032
You don't ask why.
Those ten seconds on the phone
could have blown the op.

471
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:29,993
The op was bringing
Schmidt across!
The op was
setting up Ann Cathcart.

472
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:33,664
And your end
had to look legit.

473
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:35,666
What are you telling me?
Schmidt was bait?

474
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:39,962
Yes.
Nathan, they executed him
on a shitty cellar floor!

475
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:42,506
It could have been you.
Let me tell you something
about Schmidt.

476
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:45,425
He went to the Russians
a week ago, and said he had
a contact, an American.

477
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:48,470
Somebody he could use.
Don't tell me that.

478
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:50,681
You didn't look in his eyes.

479
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:52,224
Don't tell me that!

480
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:55,310
He was your asset.
Somebody you used
for information.

481
00:48:55,394 --> 00:49:00,107
Aw, Jesus Christ! You don't
just trade these people
like they're baseball cards.

482
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,984
It's not a fuckin' game!
Oh, yes, it is.

483
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:03,652
That's exactly
what it is.

484
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:06,613
And it's no kid's game, either.
This is a whole other game.

485
00:49:06,697 --> 00:49:10,075
And it's serious and
it's dangerous-and it's
not one you want to lose.

486
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:18,000
Nathan,
we killed this man.

487
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,295
We used him,
and we killed him.

488
00:49:22,713 --> 00:49:25,090
Okay, then you gotta help me
understand this one.

489
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:27,551
You...
Nathan, what are
we doin' here?

490
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:29,469
Don't give me
some bullshit about
the greater good.

491
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:32,055
That's exactly
what it's about.

492
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:37,436
Because what we do
is unfortunately
very, very necessary.

493
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:40,022
And if you?re not
willing to sacrifice
scum like Schmidt...

494
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:42,816
for those that want
nothing more than
their freedom,

495
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,652
then you better take
a hard look at your
profession, my friend.

496
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:47,404
Because it doesn't get any easier.

497
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:49,865
Why did you use me?
Do you want to walk?

498
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:51,992
Walk.

499
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:00,959
You should have told me
about the op.

500
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:05,422
You used me.
I did. And listen to this,
because this is important.

501
00:50:05,506 --> 00:50:07,925
If you had pulled
some stunt over there,

502
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:10,093
I wouldn't come after you.

503
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:13,639
You go off the reservation,
I will not come after you.

504
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:24,024
Fuck your rules, Nathan.

505
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:27,361
Okay. But tonight,
they saved your life.

506
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,684
Can we have
the relevant files
on Ann Cathcart?

507
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:10,904
Ann Cathcart's body
was found...

508
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:13,657
in the lobby of
a cheap hotel in East Germany,

509
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,784
just two months after
she defected.

510
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,833
Yeah. Beaten to death.

511
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:26,170
Vopos never solved the case.
And Bishop was in Berlin
when this happened.

512
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:29,089
We were both in Berlin...
Do you recall
Bishop's reaction...

513
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:32,092
to the news that
Ann Cathcart was dead?

514
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:38,515
Motive and opportunity.

515
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:43,270
Nathan, you should leave here
knowing that we're looking
into every possible scenario.

516
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:46,982
What's ''Sideshow''?

517
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:51,069
You don't need to know.

518
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,492
Why are you trying
to burn Bishop?

519
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,249
Troy?

520
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,844
Hold transcription,
hold video.

521
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:20,891
Sideshow was a bugging op.

522
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:26,563
Listening to government offices
in eastern China.

523
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:29,566
The trade talks?
Mm.

524
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,569
And you're afraid
the lid to the cookie jar
is gonna slam shut on our hand?

525
00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:36,657
Oh, come on, guys!
Chinese need trade status
more than we need to give it.

526
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,700
That's not necessarily so.

527
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:42,162
Twenty-four hours after capture,
Bishop's allowed to start talking.

528
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:45,833
That gives you, what?
Ten, twelve hours to make a trade.

529
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:48,001
Come on.
You're on the clock.

530
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:54,883
He doesn't know anything.
Bishop wasn't on Sideshow.

531
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:57,427
He wasn't working for us.

532
00:52:57,511 --> 00:53:01,098
He was arrested during
a rescue attempt...

533
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:04,434
at a prison
outside Su Chou.

534
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,318
Who was he after?
Don't know.

535
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:17,781
Let go of me!

536
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:33,463
For more on this
late-breaking story,

537
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:36,884
we go live to Hong Kong.

538
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:39,386
It has been confirmed
that the Chinese claim...

539
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:42,472
to have arrested an American
operative for the C.I.A.

540
00:53:42,556 --> 00:53:46,351
While the State Department
remains quiet, official sources
say that the individual,

541
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:48,729
working out of American
consulate in Hong Kong,

542
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:50,898
was captured
in an act of espionage.

543
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:54,234
If confirmed, this comes
at a bad time for an administration...

544
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:57,446
which is in the middle
of trade negotiations with China.

545
00:53:57,529 --> 00:54:00,491
The U.S. government is in the process
of negotiating his release.

546
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:02,451
The embassy promised
to keep us abreast...
We are so fucked.

547
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,995
of the situation a sit develops.

548
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:09,791
This is Frank Nall, live in Hong Kong.
Guess that limits our options.

549
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:13,462
I want to know what
you have to say about this,

550
00:54:13,545 --> 00:54:15,923
and I want it
on the record.

551
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:24,598
When I was a kid,
I used to spend summers
on my uncle's farm.

552
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:28,852
And he had this plow horse
that he used to work with
every day.

553
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:31,230
He really loved
that plow horse.

554
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:32,981
One summer
she came up lame,

555
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:35,317
and could barely stand.

556
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,945
The vet offered
to put her down.

557
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:40,489
You know what
my uncle said?

558
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:44,034
No, Muir.
What did he say?

559
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:48,080
He said, ''Why would I ask
somebody else to kill a horse
that belonged to me?''

560
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:58,966
Get me Peter Brody
at the FCC.

561
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:01,385
I don't care.
Just get him.

562
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:06,557
Looks like Bishop's
gonna be okay.

563
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:10,561
Good.

564
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:15,691
What about the flag?
Keep it.

565
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:17,693
Something to
remember me by.

566
00:55:17,776 --> 00:55:19,695
You know where to store
this stuff, right?

567
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:21,905
Yeah.
What do I do with
the storage key?

568
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:24,575
If I need it, I'll send for it.
I'll send you a postcard.

569
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:28,036
From where?
Not a chance.

570
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,039
You'd show up and try
to clean the place, and scare
the native girls away.

571
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:35,586
I wish. I'll be working for
Andy Unger down the hall.

572
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:46,263
You're gonna miss it.

573
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:52,561
You know that, don't you?

574
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:17,920
Thank you. Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Have a nice day.
Thank you. Thank you.

575
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:30,390
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

576
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:33,101
For more on this story,
we go live to Hong Kong.

577
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,648
And, in a late-breaking
development of the incident
reported earlier,

578
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:41,735
rumours that Tom Bishop,
an alleged C.I.A. operative,

579
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:45,948
had been captured
in an act of espionage,
now appears to be a hoax.

580
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:48,492
Tom Bishop died
14 months ago.

581
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:51,245
While the C.I.A. has
made no official comment,

582
00:56:51,328 --> 00:56:54,289
sources close to the agency
have confirmed Bishop's death
late last year.

583
00:56:54,373 --> 00:56:57,000
The discredited story
has been attributed...

584
00:56:57,084 --> 00:56:59,044
to an overzealous member
of the Chinese government,

585
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:03,590
who leaked the false information
in the hopes of undermining the
current U.S. trade negotiations.

586
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:06,760
This is Frank Nall,
live in Hong Kong.

587
00:57:06,844 --> 00:57:08,971
Mr. Muir?

588
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:23,694
Told you you'd miss it.

589
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:27,281
Who do you trust
in military intelligence?

590
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:29,283
I co-signed
Martha Rayburn's car loan.

591
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:31,493
Listen, Gladys.
I gotta buy some time here.

592
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:37,332
I'm gonna need imagery Analysis
for a military prison near Su Chou.

593
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:40,127
And if you use the phones,
don't use these.

594
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:43,881
Any chance I could
lose my job over this?

595
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:47,843
Good. I didn't want to work
for Andy Unger anyway.

596
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:04,485
I know who it is.

597
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:06,528
I know who Bishop was after.

598
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:11,533
Well, so do we.
But do you know why?

599
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:15,996
I mean, if anybody
knew the back story,

600
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,748
I mean, it would,
well, uh,

601
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:21,543
It?s just that it would make
a congressional hearing
really worth watching.

602
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:24,671
By the way, that's not
in the op reports.

603
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:39,937
Muir, you're not cleared
to be in here.

604
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:43,565
Relax, Kappler.
If I didn't have clearance,
how did I get in?

605
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:46,026
Where's this report?
I just came from
the seventh floor,

606
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:48,695
and there's some people
pretty disappointed
it hasn't arrived yet.

607
00:58:48,779 --> 00:58:50,197
Hold on!

608
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:54,827
What report?

609
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,995
You were at the briefing.
I'm talking about Tom Bishop.

610
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:59,373
Bishop went rogue.
Yeah, and they were gonna...

611
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:02,626
pull him out until
somebody up there...
and I'm not gonna say who...

612
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:05,254
said that your department claimed
there weren't enough resources.

613
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:07,089
Who said that?

614
00:59:08,674 --> 00:59:11,426
Look, I can buy some time
while you pull this together.

615
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,930
Now, Operation Sideshow.
That's near the prison, right?

616
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:18,892
Near Su Chou.

617
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:21,770
China. Come on.

618
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:27,734
Any air support?

619
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:41,957
P'eng Hu Islands.

620
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,750
Commander Wiley's
outfit.

621
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:46,295
Forty minutes from
Su Chou Prison.

622
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:50,007
Thank you.
Oh, hey,

623
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:54,219
I'm having a little retirement
dinnerparty tonight.

624
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:56,722
Services library. Say, 7:00?
Sure.

625
00:59:56,805 --> 01:00:00,142
You know, I uh...
I didn't know you liked me.

626
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:21,205
What was that all about?
What did Muir want?
What?

627
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:23,499
He was just talking.

628
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,794
What about?
His party.

629
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:32,174
I don't think
you're invited.

630
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:40,682
Gladys?

631
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:43,352
Hello?

632
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:45,479
It's me.

633
01:00:47,272 --> 01:00:50,442
Where are you?
First floor coffee shop.

634
01:00:50,526 --> 01:00:55,823
Talk to me.
Imagery Analysis. They've got
every angle on the prison...

635
01:00:55,906 --> 01:00:57,825
you could want,
collecting dust.

636
01:00:57,908 --> 01:00:59,576
Gladys?
Get me whatever they have.

637
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,495
That'll have to go
through Folger's office.

638
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:05,207
I'm aware of that.
I also need info on an outfit
of ours in the P'eng Hu Islands.

639
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:09,628
Commander Wiley's outfit.
Muir?

640
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:12,506
Muir, wait up.

641
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:15,843
And call Kappler
in the map room.

642
01:01:15,926 --> 01:01:18,887
- Tell him my party's cancelled.
- Your party?

643
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:27,938
<i>We're gonna need you
upstairs a bit longer.</i>

644
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:32,192
What's that?
I said, we're gonna need you
upstairs a bit longer.

645
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:41,076
You got something
in your teeth.

646
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:56,175
Harker says you might care
to enlighten us on information
that's not in your op reports?

647
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:59,094
I just want
to help out.

648
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:01,138
Is it relevant
to the issue at hand?

649
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:06,143
I know who
Bishop was after.

650
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:11,106
Elizabeth Hadley.

651
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:20,824
Pull up what we have
on Hadley.

652
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:49,436
It was a tip of the sword
deal, out of Beirut.

653
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:54,608
Intended to be clean
and efficient in a place
that was anything but.

654
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:56,610
By '85, the place
was a nightmare.

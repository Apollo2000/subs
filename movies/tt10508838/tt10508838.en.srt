2
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,708
SOUTHERN ZHAO, NORTHERN YAN

3
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,000
<i>In the Central Plains,</i>

4
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,666
<i>there had been years of bloody war
between Southern Zhao and Northern Yan,</i>

5
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,000
<i>leaving their people destitute.</i>

6
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,750
<i>The battle ended in a dead heat</i>

7
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,541
<i>and both finally reached
an agreement for peace.</i>

8
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,916
<i>However, the peaceful situation
only lasted for ten years.</i>

9
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,083
<i>As the new king of Northern Yan
ascends the throne,</i>

10
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:17,708
<i>armies of the Northern Yan
continue to covet Southern Zhao.</i>

11
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:22,666
<i>The Central Plains will be caught
in a sanguinary war again.</i>

12
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,416
The envoys of Northern Yan
are presenting their gift.

13
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,083
Your Majesty, I wish you
eternal health and well-being,

14
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,333
and boundless happiness.

15
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,083
Protect His Majesty!

16
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,291
Your Majesty!

17
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,250
Bring her back alive!

18
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,708
When the new king of Northern Yan
has just ascended the throne,

19
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,791
their assassins

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,291
have snuck into Lingyan Pavilion
to assassinate Your Majesty.

21
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,375
It's a declaration of war!

22
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,208
If I may be so bold
to admonish Your Majesty

23
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,541
to resume with the Martial Contest.

24
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,291
The selection of Grand Field Marshal
cannot be postponed anymore.

25
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:02,250
I am willing to host this contest
to help ease Your Majesty's burden.

26
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,041
Since it's your idea,

27
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,791
then I will leave it to you, Grand Tutor.

28
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,291
As you wish, Your Majesty.

29
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,708
<i>Within three days,</i>

30
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,291
<i>the Messenger Eagles will reach
the territories of the Eight Clans</i>

31
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,000
<i>with the announcement to all the warriors
of the gathering in Phoenix City.</i>

32
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,375
There's no more water supply for today.

33
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,583
Come earlier tomorrow.

34
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,708
Bastard, you're stealing water again!

35
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,541
- Stop running!
- Stop!

36
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,583
- Bastard!
- Stop!

37
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,166
Stop! Bastard!

38
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,500
Bastard, stop running!

39
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,666
Stop running! Stay right there!

40
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,000
Stay right there! Stop running!

41
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,791
Get out of my way!

42
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,041
Don't come over!

43
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,666
My child!

44
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,291
Stop right there!

45
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,666
Little bastard,
let's see where else you can run to.

46
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,041
Put me down.

47
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,000
Chief.

48
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,666
Chief.

49
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,041
Chief.

50
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,041
Here's the emperor's decree
from Phoenix City.

51
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,500
The Martial Contest is about to resume.

52
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,375
There will be war again.

53
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,958
The system stipulates

54
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,875
that three warriors from each clan
have to be selected for the contest.

55
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,333
As of the day
when the Messenger Eagles arrive,

56
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,875
the contestants shall gather
before the full moon

57
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,458
in Phoenix City with their clan totems.

58
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,000
Any violation

59
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,291
constitutes a clan-implicated crime.

60
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,083
A clan-implicated crime?

61
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,625
A clan-implicated crime?

62
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,750
Any voluntary warriors?

63
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,000
Me! I'll go!

64
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,541
I'll go!

65
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,125
Let me go! I'll go!

66
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,166
Keep quiet.

67
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,375
Cang Qiu, put him down.

68
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:37,916
Serves you right.

69
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,041
Chief!

70
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,625
Dong Yilong.

71
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:42,916
Why are you messing around?

72
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,208
I'm not!

73
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,166
After I become the Grand Field Marshal
of Southern Zhao,

74
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,125
I'll mount the clan flag of Qingyuan Clan

75
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,708
on top of that young king.

76
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,916
Let's see who dares
to call me a bastard again.

77
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,583
Bastard!

78
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,666
Enough of your nonsense.

79
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,916
If I enter the Martial Contest,

80
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,750
besides being the Grand Field Marshal,
are there any other benefits?

81
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,625
This Martial Contest is being hosted
by Grand Tutor Guan in person.

82
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,958
The winning warrior will be able to join
the emperor's heaven worship ceremony.

83
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,750
By then, you can get whatever you want.

84
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,583
I'll go.

85
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,875
I'll go.

86
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,875
Even a deserter has the nerves to go.

87
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,125
No fighting.

88
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,166
All right.

89
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,291
The three of you should go and get ready.

90
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,708
LAN PING

91
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,583
When your mother was pregnant with you,

92
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,791
she fled from beyond the frontier
and was wounded.

93
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,416
In the end, all she left you
was this broken comb.

94
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,041
Push harder, you're almost there.

95
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,083
He's here.

96
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:11,791
Chief.

97
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,250
The boy's father

98
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,166
named him...

99
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,500
Dong Yilong.

100
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,041
This boy...

101
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
I'll leave him to you.

102
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,666
Who is the boy's father?

103
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,458
This time, I'm leaving Qingyuan Village
not only for the contest.

104
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,083
Perhaps, I could also find out
about my origin.

105
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,958
You will have to find the answer yourself.

106
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,666
When you came back
from the battlefield ten years ago,

107
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,125
you were on the brink of death.

108
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,333
But somehow, you firmly grasped onto this.

109
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,708
Now,

110
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,583
it should be returned to
its rightful owner.

111
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,541
CHU

112
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,708
Thank you, Chief.

113
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,791
QINGYUAN VILLAGE, CHENJIAO DESERT

114
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,916
<i>Bastard, let me tell you some good news.</i>

115
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,583
Legend has it that there's a Mystic Forest
in Phoenix City.

116
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,500
It knows about everything
that happened in the past.

117
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,333
It can even tell you who your father is.

118
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,958
In fact, it might even know
how your parents began their romance.

119
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,708
How can we get there?

120
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:12,958
The problem is no one knows
where this Mystic Forest exactly is.

121
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,916
- Stop walking!
- Stop?

122
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,416
When can we get to Phoenix City then?

123
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,333
Hey.

124
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,458
Cang Qiu!

125
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,375
Is he dead?

126
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,833
What do you think?

127
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Shouldn't we find his body?

128
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,000
You should just save some energy
for our journey.

129
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,333
If we fail to get to Phoenix City
before the full moon,

130
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,333
you will have to bury
the entire Qingyuan Clan's dead bodies.

131
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,625
But he was our companion!

132
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,541
Right now, I'm more concerned
about finding us a new teammate.

133
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,541
It's delicious.

134
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:33,833
What is it?

135
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,125
Why are you eating so much
when you're out in the open?

136
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,041
Once you're under attack,
you won't be able to run.

137
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,041
But you...

138
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,458
Back in Qingyuan Clan,

139
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,875
everyone calls you Deserter.

140
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,625
What's your name?

141
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,750
Is your family name Chu?

142
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't understand.

143
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,125
In Qingyuan Clan,

144
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,875
no one shows you any respect.

145
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,625
But you're still going to fight for them.

146
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,416
- Is it because you...
- I'm not doing this for them.

147
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,166
I'm doing it for the former owner

148
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,250
of this broken spear.

149
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,583
Back then, we had a fierce war

150
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,083
with the army of Northern Yan.

151
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,416
The Southern Zhao's marshal
leading the Chu Army

152
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,041
was my brother, Chu Cheng.

153
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,125
<i>At the time, I was only 16 years old.</i>

154
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,875
<i>It was right here</i>

155
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,166
<i>that we, the Chu Army,
shattered Northern Yan Army into pieces,</i>

156
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,375
<i>followed by their retreat.</i>

157
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,208
<i>My brother, Chu Cheng,</i>

158
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,333
<i>hunted down the general of Northern Yan.</i>

159
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,291
Father!

160
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,416
Father!

161
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,291
Father!

162
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,416
<i>But in the end,</i>

163
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,000
in that battle,

164
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,041
I ended up being the only survivor.

165
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,916
I didn't expect Northern Yan
to be so powerful

166
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,458
that they eliminated the entire Chu Army.

167
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,875
It was not Northern Yan
that neutralized the Chu Army!

168
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,541
It was Grand Tutor Guan of Southern Zhao!

169
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,250
Chu Cheng!

170
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,833
Where are the reinforcements?

171
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,208
Where are the reinforcements?

172
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,875
Grand Tutor Guan
has long dreaded the Chu Army!

173
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,875
He wants to see us die here!

174
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,291
He won't send us any reinforcements!

175
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,375
Chu Hun, stay alive!

176
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,291
You have to stay alive!

177
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,625
Chu Cheng!

178
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,958
You have to stay alive!

179
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,750
Grand Tutor Guan?

180
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,541
Greetings, Emissary.

181
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,500
It has been so many years

182
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,750
since Northern Yan made you
Southern Zhao's Grand Tutor.

183
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,958
But you haven't done anything.

184
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,250
You must have forgotten your mission.

185
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,500
Are you planning to stay here
as their grand tutor

186
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,000
for the rest of your life?

187
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,833
I have been waiting these past years
for the chance,

188
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,625
so that we can overturn
Southern Zhao at a stroke.

189
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,958
But His Majesty can't wait any longer.

190
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,666
He has lost patience with you.

191
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,583
I only need one month

192
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,333
and Southern Zhao
will be at my fingertips.

193
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,000
If this plan fails,

194
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,000
what should I tell His Majesty?

195
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,791
Screw that Lingyan Pavilion.

196
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,500
The Martial Contest?

197
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,583
His Majesty has had enough
of your sophistry.

198
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,750
As long as we detain
all the imperial family of Southern Zhao

199
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,125
in Lingyan Pavilion during the finals...

200
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,750
Southern Zhao will definitely perish.

201
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,250
What exactly is the contest about?

202
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,333
Running?

203
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,458
Horse racing?

204
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,250
Hey.

205
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,083
Or arm wrestling?

206
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,000
Hey! Return our clan totem!

207
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,583
Come and get it if you can!

208
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,375
They are the Lizard Clan.

209
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,000
Who is that girl?

210
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,375
Let's go.

211
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,708
Don't be nosy.

212
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,791
Run!

213
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,208
Run!

214
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,333
Hold on!

215
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,083
Help!

216
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,416
Help!

217
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,250
Help me!

218
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,375
Hang in there!

219
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,000
Don't pull my pants!

220
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,833
Hang on!

221
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:00,833
Bastard.

222
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,708
Bastard!

223
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,458
Yilong!

224
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,083
Yilong!

225
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,666
Dong Yilong!

226
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,291
What did you just call me?

227
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,333
Besides our chief,

228
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,208
you're the first one
who called me by my name.

229
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,500
Who is that?

230
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,750
She was just right there.

231
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,083
I'm Jia Lu, Chief of the Lizard Clan.

232
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,625
Thank you for your rescue.

233
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:36,833
Here's a token of appreciation.

234
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,916
Right, Chief Jia Lu.

235
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,291
Have you heard of Mystic Forest?

236
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,208
That's just a fairy tale.

237
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,208
Forget it then.

238
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,041
Young man.

239
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:57,791
See you in Phoenix City.

240
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Hey.

241
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,916
Deserter, wait up!

242
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,458
Deserter, wait for me.

243
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,041
My name is Chu Hun.

244
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,166
All right, I got it.

245
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,541
Can I get on the horse now?

246
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,208
Isn't your <i>qinggong</i> great?

247
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,083
There's no need for you to ride the horse.

248
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,000
Hey!

249
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,416
Don't be so mean.

250
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,291
We're still far away.

251
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,416
Give me a ride.

252
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,083
I have my favorite sapodilla.

253
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,208
Would you like to have one?

254
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,416
Wait, how about two?

255
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:38,375
PHOENIX CITY

256
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:58,666
What is it?

257
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,083
That happened to the burglars
from Northern Yan.

258
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,750
If you can't bear the sight of this,

259
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,541
return to Qingyuan Village
as soon as possible.

260
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,291
...Southern Zhao!

261
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,625
The fighter lives!

262
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:16,000
The coward dies!

263
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,375
Northern Yan is subjugated
by Southern Zhao!

264
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,416
A sword from the ancestors!

265
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:41,458
Hey.

266
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,833
Warriors, take a look.

267
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:51,750
Here.

268
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,208
Give me.

269
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,416
Give me that!

270
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:57,000
Give me.

271
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,333
PHOENIX POSTHOUSE

272
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:16,166
Sir, do you really not know
where Mystic Forest is?

273
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,250
Goodness!

274
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:18,833
Didn't I tell you?

275
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:20,833
That's just a rumor.

276
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,541
No one knows where it is.

277
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,541
If it weren't for you,
we would have arrived long ago!

278
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,791
What did you say? Say it again.

279
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,166
You too!

280
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,000
PHOENIX POSTHOUSE

281
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,708
Isn't that the girl we met in the desert?

282
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,625
Cut the crap.

283
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,208
- What is it?
- Come, let's drink.

284
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,125
Sir, give me two portions
of your signature dishes.

285
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,000
- I'm starving.
- All right!

286
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,291
Two horses,

287
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,666
three injured men,

288
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,375
and our clan totem.

289
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,125
How should we settle the score?

290
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,041
It's none of your business.

291
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,333
When I become the Grand Field Marshal,

292
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:26,750
I will return everything to you.

293
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,458
Do you think you can get away with it?

294
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,375
Can you outpace me?

295
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,333
Don't you want your clan totem?

296
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,125
Can you outpace me?

297
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,041
Here comes the Grand Tutor!

298
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,125
What are you looking at? Kneel.

299
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:42,583
Grand Tutor Guan.

300
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:51,958
Kneel.

301
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,083
You...

302
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,166
Kneel.

303
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,333
Kneel!

304
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,125
It has been ten years

305
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:17,416
since I last joined the gathering
of all the warriors

306
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,541
from the Eight Clans of Southern Zhao.

307
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:23,666
Warriors.

308
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,208
Bottoms up.

309
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:32,083
I would like to add something.

310
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,541
Since you have signed up,
there is no turning back.

311
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:35,958
Those who withdraw without permission

312
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,708
will be charged
with a clan-implicated crime.

313
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:38,833
Bear that in mind.

314
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Warriors.

315
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,250
See you in the arena

316
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:45,916
the day after tomorrow, at noon.

317
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,666
Grand Tutor Guan is surrounded
by many guards.

318
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,041
Will you be able to kill him?

319
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,541
As long as I can enter it,

320
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,541
I'll have the chance to approach him.

321
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,625
If you're scared
that you would be implicated,

322
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,791
you can turn me in now.

323
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:21,291
Chu Hun.

324
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,041
I'm your friend.

325
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,750
I won't sell you out.

326
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,541
I don't have friends and I don't need one.

327
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,250
What I know is that

328
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,125
whoever stops me
from killing Grand Tutor Guan

329
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,958
is my enemy.

330
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,750
Here, I don't want to become your enemy.

331
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,875
All the villagers call you Bastard,

332
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,125
but why do you still live happily
every day?

333
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,833
My mother once told me in my dream

334
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,666
that I'll be a great warrior.

335
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,750
"Don't stoop down to their level."

336
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,291
Then ask your mother tonight

337
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,541
if we can find a new teammate tomorrow.

338
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:16,291
My mother doesn't turn up
in my dream every night.

339
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,083
But let me tell you this.

340
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:20,750
She will definitely bless us.

341
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,791
PHOENIX POSTHOUSE

342
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:32,458
What if we can't find anyone by tomorrow
and get disqualified?

343
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:34,333
Run for your life then.

344
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:39,041
Come and have a look, my friends.

345
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,791
I have two slaves from Northern Yan.

346
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,916
Only one of them can survive.

347
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:46,416
Today, I am willing to reluctantly part
with the one who survives

348
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,750
by selling her to you.

349
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,000
Keep your eyes open.

350
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,791
- Get up.
- Come on!

351
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:02,041
Here we go!

352
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,333
I should go.

353
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:44,875
Aren't you going to be
the Grand Field Marshal?

354
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,041
One day, when you lead troops in a battle,

355
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,458
things will be much more brutal than this.

356
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,750
If we lose the war to Northern Yan,

357
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,333
you will be one of these caged fighters.

358
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:38,625
Bravo!

359
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,833
The winner for today is Bi Nu.

360
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:45,541
- Great.
- Great.

361
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:49,166
- Great.
- Great.

362
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:52,500
Come on.

363
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,333
Who wants to take
this Northern Yan bitch back home

364
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,625
to have fun with?

365
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,166
Although this chick looks rough-skinned,

366
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,666
she will make a good house guard.

367
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:05,791
It's a special offer.

368
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:14,916
There has not been any war
for over a decade.

369
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,458
I don't have many of them in stock.

370
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:19,333
Look, a genuine slave from Northern Yan.

371
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:21,375
Do whatever you like to her.

372
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,083
You won't be fooled
and there's nothing to lose.

373
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,750
Don't even hesitate.

374
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:29,000
CHU

375
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,541
If you miss this chance today,

376
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,041
you will surely regret it.

377
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,666
- Let's go.
- Any bidder?

378
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,791
- Hey.
- Yes?

379
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:50,750
You just raised your hand,
so she's yours now.

380
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,500
This warrior has good taste, come here.

381
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,333
Let's confirm your payment.

382
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,333
Move. Come over.

383
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,791
You have good taste, young man.

384
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,125
Behave yourself.

385
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:11,708
Keep still.

386
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,458
She's quite a good fighter.

387
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:25,000
- She's from Northern Yan.
- Why did you raise your hand then?

388
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,041
- I...
- Here.

389
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,000
What?

390
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:32,666
We're short of money to recruit others.

391
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,625
What should we do now?

392
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,166
Don't worry.

393
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:36,416
I don't need money.

394
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,416
- What?
- I...

395
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:38,791
I'm in.

396
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,875
It was you.

397
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,458
The thief who stole the clan totem.

398
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,416
I didn't steal it.

399
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:45,541
I just borrowed it.

400
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,375
I can only join the contest
if I have a clan totem.

401
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:49,875
You're short of a teammate,
so count me in.

402
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,750
Have you been in the contest before?

403
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,833
- No.
- Kid.

404
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,416
Find someone else to play with.

405
00:35:58,583 --> 00:35:59,833
I just want to play with you.

406
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:07,708
Hey.

407
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,500
Skills and one's age
aren't necessarily related.

408
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,000
Take this.

409
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,416
I don't need much.

410
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,625
Just board and lodging will do.

411
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,541
- Hey.
- What?

412
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:31,958
I agree.

413
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:35,833
I agree too.

414
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,583
Two to one.

415
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,708
Do you really want
to be the Grand Field Marshal?

416
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,833
I want to have my name forever recorded

417
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,416
in the hero chronicle
of the Martial Contest to prove myself.

418
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,625
What's your name then?

419
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:53,708
I don't have one.

420
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,375
My last name is Jinggang, so I'm known as

421
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:56,750
Ms. Jinggang.

422
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,458
Chu Hun.

423
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,708
Dong Yilong.

424
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,125
Ms. Jinggang.

425
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:02,916
Great.

426
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,833
Yilong, let's go.

427
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:10,916
Right.

428
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:16,833
PHOENIX POSTHOUSE

429
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,000
Do you want to kill me?

430
00:38:36,875 --> 00:38:39,333
My father was killed with this spear.

431
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:42,458
This spear. This word.

432
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,916
I won't forget them
for the rest of my life.

433
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,208
<i>Do you remember that the Chu Army</i>

434
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,041
<i>took my father's life ten years ago?</i>

435
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:55,333
Father!

436
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,791
Don't come over!

437
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,333
Finally,

438
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,416
I get to meet this spear's owner.

439
00:39:33,541 --> 00:39:34,708
I'll atone with my life

440
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,583
right after I kill Grand Tutor Guan.

441
00:39:39,666 --> 00:39:41,375
You'd better stay alive then.

442
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,958
A few days ago,

443
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:49,083
Northern Yan sent men
to assassinate His Majesty.

444
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:50,791
It's an overt provocation
to Southern Zhao.

445
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,791
Between the nations,
war will be inevitable.

446
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:55,041
But today,

447
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,708
among our warriors,

448
00:40:56,916 --> 00:41:00,125
someone will represent
the honor of their clans!

449
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,416
They will pay homage to our emperor's flag
with Northern Yan people's blood

450
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,083
and restart our quest

451
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,583
for unification!

452
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,000
This Martial Contest is different
from the previous ones!

453
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Round one.

454
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,000
The first three clans

455
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:15,291
to reach the Roll Call Platform
where the Grand Tutor is

456
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,083
may advance to the next round.

457
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:19,708
Rings around their waists!

458
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,291
Why tie us together?

459
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,458
What are they doing?

460
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,416
I have never seen
a Martial Contest like this.

461
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:30,625
This is life-risking.

462
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:36,208
Stay focused.

463
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,791
- What is it?
- Don't be afraid.

464
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,875
I'll take care of you.

465
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,166
Just mind your own business.

466
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:46,833
Get ready.

467
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:49,583
Ready!

468
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,708
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

469
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,166
Change the formation!

470
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,166
Chu Hun, we're in the rear now.

471
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,541
Let's go!

472
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:14,833
Dodge!

473
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:25,750
Let's go!

474
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:56,458
Let's go!

475
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:02,750
Dodge.

476
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:05,416
Look out!

477
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:17,541
First place!

478
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,083
Zixuan Clan!

479
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,375
Save him.

480
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,125
It's hooked.

481
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:43,500
Let's go.

482
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,875
I'll throw you down
if you keep fooling around.

483
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,458
Second place!

484
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:55,458
- Qingyuan Clan!
- We won.

485
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,833
Get up, now!

486
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Get up!

487
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,166
Get up now!

488
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:14,500
I will repay you!

489
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:25,666
We can't lose.

490
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:28,416
The sword.

491
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:40,541
Third place.

492
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:42,250
Falcon Clan!

493
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,708
LOSER

494
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:28,208
I know what you want to do,

495
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:29,791
but Jinggang is innocent.

496
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:43,583
Mr. Wen, for the sake of victory,
you did what you did.

497
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:44,583
I'm impressed.

498
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:55,916
<i>I'll atone with my life</i>

499
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,625
<i>right after I kill Grand Tutor Guan.</i>

500
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,083
I'm excited too,

501
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:02,791
but I'm too tired to get worked up.

502
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,416
I just want to grab something to eat.

503
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,333
Tears of joy.

504
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,583
I can understand that.

505
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,708
CHU

506
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,625
Is this General Chu Cheng's spear?

507
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,166
Yes.

508
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:39,333
He was my brother.

509
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,291
So you're a descendant of the Chu Army.

510
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:43,416
I've heard your stories
since I was little.

511
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,916
Chu Hun, take it.

512
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:58,208
Come on.

513
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:04,958
Kill him.

514
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:16,625
Keep up the good work.

515
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:36,666
Take this.

516
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,208
Give it back.

517
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,500
- Why would you have a woman's stuff?
- Give it back.

518
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:58,875
It's from your lover, right?

519
00:49:58,958 --> 00:49:59,791
Give it to me.

520
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,958
Give it back!

521
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:07,041
Let me keep it for you for now.

522
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:08,916
Focus on the contest.

523
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:12,833
You can ask for anything except for that.

524
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:13,791
It's...

525
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:17,416
It is my mother's only legacy.

526
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:22,416
If you like it, I can get you another one.

527
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:32,625
At least your mother
had left something for you.

528
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:35,000
My mother didn't even give me a name.

529
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:41,416
It's all right.

530
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,791
When we get to Mystic Forest,
you can find out the truth.

531
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,333
I don't care about the past.

532
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:47,750
I only care about the future.

533
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:08,500
You were so close to him.

534
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,833
Why didn't you kill him?

535
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:11,541
I will kill him,

536
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:13,583
but not now.

537
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:16,416
You can only take revenge
when you have the strength.

538
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:17,500
Eat up.

539
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:30,166
Yilong!

540
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:41,333
We can't stay here anymore, let's go!

541
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,583
So the annihilation of the Chu Army
is related to Grand Tutor Guan.

542
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,250
Then the wire-puller
behind the assault just now is...

543
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:53,958
Who else could it be?

544
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:57,791
Grand Tutor Guan wanted to create
the false impression of clans' infighting

545
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:00,041
as a tool and disguise to kill me.

546
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:01,791
But Tiger-Roars Clan failed.

547
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:02,916
So they must be killed.

548
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:07,833
Dong Yilong.

549
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:09,333
Take Jinggang with you.

550
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:13,291
I'm coming with you.

551
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:14,500
Me too.

552
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:18,708
What are you doing?

553
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,625
From the moment the three of us

554
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,666
stood in the arena
and were bound with iron chains,

555
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,583
our fates have been tied together.

556
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:25,500
That's right.

557
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:34,166
Actually, Chu Hun,

558
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:36,666
if we can get into the finals,

559
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:39,375
you will be able to become
the Grand Field Marshal.

560
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:40,541
In that case,

561
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:43,416
you'll have the chance to testify against
Grand Tutor Guan to His Majesty.

562
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,708
At that time,
you'll be able to avenge the Chu Army.

563
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:18,291
May your mother bless us,

564
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,500
so that we can make it to the finals.

565
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:24,750
I'm sure that we will.

566
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:27,666
From now on, every moment shall be taken

567
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:29,208
as the final.

568
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:30,500
That's right.

569
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:43,375
Yilong, I'm starving.

570
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:47,458
I'll get you some steamed buns.

571
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:51,333
- I need three.
- All right.

572
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,083
Let me keep this for you for tonight.

573
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,291
Why didn't you go home?

574
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:17,750
Where should I go?

575
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:20,041
Northern Yan?

576
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:22,000
That's right, you're free now.

577
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:29,625
I haven't tried that before.

578
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,375
You will love it.

579
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,833
Why would you and Chu Hun love this?

580
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:40,875
This liquor is so strong.

581
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:42,125
It makes me sick.

582
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:45,708
Doesn't living make us sick too?

583
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:48,333
- Young man.
- Yes?

584
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:50,791
What do you live for then?

585
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:55,458
I have no idea
because I don't even know who I am.

586
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:59,166
But I always feel that
I should do something.

587
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:01,375
What is it?

588
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,750
To not let the innocent be killed.

589
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:08,916
Who do you think is innocent then?

590
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:12,916
Both you and Chu Hun are innocent.

591
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:52,875
Hurry up.

592
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:54,041
Go.

593
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:57,833
Move.

594
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:58,833
Go.

595
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,583
Go.

596
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,625
Hurry.

597
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:18,708
Get lost!

598
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:19,791
<i>Round two!</i>

599
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:22,708
<i>The task is to snatch
the Beast King's egg.</i>

600
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,375
<i>The first clan to bring back
the Beast King's egg</i>

601
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,333
<i>will get into the finals!</i>

602
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:29,875
They have arrived,
so we have to make haste.

603
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:51,083
What on earth is the Beast King?

604
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,791
Is it a tiger or a lion?

605
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:57,125
The Beast King was a war monster
fostered by Southern Zhao.

606
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:58,750
It is ferocious and bloodthirsty.

607
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:00,166
Intended for war,

608
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,958
people embedded a headwear

609
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:04,166
with sharp thorns on the top of its skull

610
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,625
to make it appear brutish.

611
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:09,166
After the war, it was deserted here.

612
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:12,791
Sounds like the Beast King
is quite pitiful.

613
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,625
If you run into it,

614
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:16,541
you will be the pitiful one.

615
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:19,625
Stay alert.

616
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:45,625
Chief!

617
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:49,500
Since we're here,

618
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:50,958
without the Beast King's egg,

619
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:52,416
none of us is getting out of here.

620
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,583
Let's go.

621
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:19,125
Stay away from it!

622
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,625
This flower is poisonous.

623
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:25,583
Don't touch it.

624
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:31,958
Over here.

625
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:43,375
Water...

626
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:46,583
Chu Hun, since you know about this flower,

627
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:48,291
you should know of the antidote, right?

628
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:49,833
I have seen it once.

629
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:51,666
It's a kind of moss...

630
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:54,708
that grows in the dark of caverns.

631
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:56,500
It's orange in color.

632
01:00:56,958 --> 01:00:58,333
Everything has its natural inhibitors.

633
01:00:58,416 --> 01:01:00,916
Therefore, the antidote
has to be in this cavern too.

634
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:02,333
Chu Hun.

635
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:04,041
I won't let you die here.

636
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:05,500
Wait for our return.

637
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:08,666
- Let's go.
- All right.

638
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,083
Chief, look!

639
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:18,791
There's light coming from that cave.

640
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:20,000
Let's check it out.

641
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:29,583
Chief!

642
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,166
Run!

643
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:59,250
The egg is right there.

644
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:11,625
We won.

645
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:16,625
Let's go!

646
01:02:27,416 --> 01:02:28,541
Save me!

647
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:31,791
That's the egg!

648
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,625
Save me!

649
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:37,958
Save me!

650
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:39,583
Cut off my leg!

651
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:27,416
Run!

652
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:49,708
Jinggang.

653
01:03:50,666 --> 01:03:51,958
Hurry, give me the egg.

654
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:55,791
Hold onto it.

655
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:01,958
Isn't that the orange moss
on the headwear?

656
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:03,625
The antidote!

657
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:23,083
Let's split up. I'll distract it.

658
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,541
Let's go!

659
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:54,625
The poison is gone.

660
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:56,458
Let's move now. The Beast King is coming.

661
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,750
What are you doing, Yilong?
The Beast King will be here anytime soon.

662
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:09,875
It's stuck there.

663
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,125
It could die. Wait for me.

664
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:20,291
Let me help you.

665
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,708
Bear with it, Beast King.

666
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,333
No, I have to help Yilong.

667
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:56,250
Exert force!

668
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:39,458
Chu Hun, give me the Beast King's egg.

669
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:53,333
I understand.

670
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:56,000
You are just trying to protect
your own child.

671
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:58,000
I, Dong Yilong,

672
01:07:58,083 --> 01:08:00,083
hereby pledge in the name
of Qingyuan Clan.

673
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:01,541
After the contest,

674
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:02,833
regardless if we win or lose,

675
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,500
I will surely bring the egg back.

676
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,541
Please trust me.

677
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,916
Chu Hun.

678
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:52,708
It's all my fault.

679
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,291
Don't worry.

680
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:56,708
I'm tough.

681
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:58,750
I've been near death several times.

682
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:02,041
Aren't you a strong girl?

683
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,500
Why are you crying?

684
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:10,958
What's the matter?

685
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:14,125
I'm very happy as well.

686
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:36,750
<i>The defeated clans!</i>

687
01:09:56,416 --> 01:10:00,791
So the three warriors of Qingyuan Clan
have gotten into the finals.

688
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,000
Congratulations.

689
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:05,625
Unfortunately,

690
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:07,958
the title of Grand Field Marshal
of Southern Zhao

691
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,375
is for only one person.

692
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:11,041
There are no rivals then.

693
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,166
Who are we competing against?

694
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,791
The ones beside you are your rivals.

695
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,750
Only the last survivor

696
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,541
among the three of you

697
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:21,291
can become the Grand Field Marshal
of Southern Zhao.

698
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:27,791
We forfeit.

699
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:30,750
Chu Hun is the most skillful
among the three of us.

700
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:31,833
We can nominate him.

701
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:34,291
That's right,
neither of us can defeat Chu Hun.

702
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:36,125
I don't think you have the grasp
of the situation.

703
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:37,916
I'm not here to inquire
about your opinion.

704
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:40,500
I'm just telling you the rules.

705
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:43,833
Among the three of you,
only the last survivor

706
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,958
can become the Grand Field Marshal
of Southern Zhao.

707
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:51,250
I shall look forward
to the result of the finals.

708
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:07,875
If it wasn't for you,

709
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:11,083
I would have ended up
in Beast King Valley.

710
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:14,250
I would have been a dead person.
I don't mind dying one more time.

711
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:18,333
But only one of us can survive

712
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:20,250
to reach the goal.

713
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:27,583
Actually...

714
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,791
You don't have to go
for each other's throat.

715
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,250
I have seen you before.

716
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:35,208
You have been following us for a while.

717
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,791
Who are you?

718
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:39,250
I am an old friend of your father's.

719
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,583
Let me take you to a place

720
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:44,375
where all your puzzles will be solved.

721
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:46,250
Where?

722
01:11:47,916 --> 01:11:49,125
Mystic Forest.

723
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,416
Move!

724
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:37,125
<i>Chu Hun, stay alive!</i>

725
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,125
<i>You have to stay alive!</i>

726
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,583
<i>You have to stay alive!</i>

727
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:44,208
Chu Cheng.

728
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,166
Are you all right?

729
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:52,791
<i>Yilong, my son.</i>

730
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:57,250
<i>You will have to assume the responsibility
of restoring peace to the Central Plains.</i>

731
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,333
What?

732
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,833
<i>Your father was the former king
of Northern Yan.</i>

733
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:09,166
I have been watching you
throughout the entire journey.

734
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:11,375
Just like your father,

735
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:14,333
you are born with compassion,
and you care for the world.

736
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:16,958
You're eligible to inherit his legacy.

737
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:18,333
You got the wrong person.

738
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,750
I'm not from Northern Yan.

739
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,041
It is up to you
whether to believe it or not.

740
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:26,458
But you bear the marks
of Northern Yan and its people.

741
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:29,750
- Nonsense!
- Smear your left arm with your blood.

742
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,750
It will prove

743
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:33,333
that my words are the truth.

744
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:43,833
Do you want me to do it?

745
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:47,208
Chu Hun, don't force him.

746
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:27,125
I have seen the totem of Northern Yan.

747
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:28,333
<i>It was not like this.</i>

748
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,708
The totem tattooed
on the ordinary Northern Yan people

749
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,166
is the mark of the civilians.

750
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:37,458
They have that tattoo on their left arm

751
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:39,916
to showcase their loyalty to the nation.

752
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,208
The reason your totem appears to be gold

753
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:46,666
is because you have the royal blood
of Northern Yan flowing in your veins.

754
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,458
It is the symbol of royalty.

755
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:50,041
You were born with it.

756
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,541
I will not have any connections
with people from Northern Yan!

757
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:24,125
Chu Hun!

758
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:26,166
Chu Hun!

759
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:29,208
Don't go, Chu Hun!

760
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,458
Don't leave!

761
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:31,708
You can't go!

762
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:32,833
Chu Hun!

763
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:33,916
Chu Hun!

764
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,083
Didn't you want to prove yourself?

765
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:41,375
You already did!

766
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:43,250
Now, it's time for me to do
what I should do.

767
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,625
Leave this place.

768
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:46,000
Stop being such a burden!

769
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:48,916
I always thought

770
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:51,666
that I would feel the happiest
once I entered the contest.

771
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:53,250
But I was wrong.

772
01:15:54,208 --> 01:15:55,958
Meeting you and Yilong

773
01:15:56,666 --> 01:15:58,000
was my greatest pleasure.

774
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:10,583
In this era of warriors,

775
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,083
there will be someone

776
01:16:13,916 --> 01:16:15,375
who will change the world

777
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,208
and rewrite history.

778
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,083
And that man

779
01:16:21,541 --> 01:16:22,833
happens to be you.

780
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:25,708
If Grand Tutor Guan's scheme
were to succeed,

781
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,833
a disaster would befall Southern Zhao.

782
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:29,583
What you can do

783
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,875
is to head back to Northern Yan quickly

784
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:33,958
and summon your father's old subordinates

785
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:35,541
to take back the throne.

786
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:39,708
Only then can you stop the war
that is about to happen.

787
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:42,208
Tomorrow, Chu Hun and Jinggang

788
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:46,000
are going to fight to the death
in the arena.

789
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:49,208
If I can't even protect
my dearest ones and my homeland,

790
01:16:49,916 --> 01:16:51,000
how will I be able

791
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:53,166
to restore world peace?

792
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:09,250
Why are you here?

793
01:17:11,541 --> 01:17:12,833
I am here to say goodbye.

794
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:15,583
Since the day you bought me,

795
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:17,708
you have given me freedom.

796
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:20,041
But after I left the posthouse,

797
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:21,458
somehow,

798
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,333
I walked back to the slave shop

799
01:17:24,083 --> 01:17:25,541
and crawled back into that cage again.

800
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:27,416
Do you know why?

801
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:32,375
It's because it wasn't the cage
that trapped me in,

802
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:34,041
<i>but my hatred.</i>

803
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:35,833
<i>I have been thinking.</i>

804
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:37,625
<i>If I don't ever let it go,</i>

805
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:40,625
<i>will this cage be with me all my life?</i>

806
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:46,083
Actually, when Jinggang
placed this in my hand,

807
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:49,375
she had given me an answer.

808
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:54,333
I want to live with dignity

809
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:57,333
just like everyone with freedom.

810
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:06,833
Take care.

811
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:26,083
Jinggang.

812
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:29,833
Jinggang!

813
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:32,041
Jinggang!

814
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,291
Jinggang!

815
01:18:34,958 --> 01:18:35,833
Jinggang!

816
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:05,958
Little girl.

817
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:07,416
Why are you crying?

818
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:09,833
Tell me.

819
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:11,291
Who bullied you?

820
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:12,875
It's all your fault!

821
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:03,916
Jinggang!

822
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:04,416
Let her go!

823
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:34,875
I need him alive.

824
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:41,958
Jinggang.

825
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:44,833
Don't be afraid.

826
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:47,791
It will be all right.

827
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:51,416
I...

828
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:55,166
I will save you.

829
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:57,708
Don't be afraid.

830
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,291
Chu Hun.

831
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,416
You are the cause of her death.

832
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:55,750
Chu Hun is the only one left.
How do we proceed with the finals?

833
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:58,000
Who says they have to fight in the finals?

834
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:01,333
Under the charge of treachery,
execute him in front of the young king.

835
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,000
Do as planned.

836
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:04,291
Start the riot.

837
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:05,541
So...

838
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:07,333
We can go home, then?

839
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:11,708
That's right.

840
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:36,458
Jinggang!

841
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:37,875
Jinggang!

842
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,208
Yilong.

843
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:43,250
Grand Tutor Guan...

844
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:45,500
captured...

845
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:47,750
Chu Hun.

846
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,125
Save him.

847
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:51,875
Save him.

848
01:23:57,375 --> 01:23:58,541
Yilong.

849
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:01,666
I'm starving.

850
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:30,791
CHU

851
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:42,541
MS. JINGGANG

852
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:33,541
If you go like this,

853
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:35,458
you will just fall
for Grand Tutor Guan's trick.

854
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:38,500
Tattooing the losers' faces
is Grand Tutor Guan's plan

855
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:40,250
to disperse the Eight Clans
of Southern Zhao.

856
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:42,708
When he achieves his goal in the finals,

857
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,250
Southern Zhao will be doomed.

858
01:26:55,916 --> 01:26:56,833
All of this

859
01:26:57,208 --> 01:26:58,875
has nothing to do with me anymore.

860
01:26:59,458 --> 01:27:01,250
Just report this to His Majesty.

861
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:03,625
His Majesty will not trust me.

862
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:06,125
Only when you call upon
the dismissed clans to join hands

863
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,583
will we be able to stop his scheme.

864
01:27:15,875 --> 01:27:17,125
What about you?

865
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:23,375
They killed Jinggang.

866
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,500
I'm going to save Chu Hun now.

867
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:42,083
Grand Tutor, you said he is a traitor.

868
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,291
Do you have any proof?

869
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:46,333
Your Majesty, his name is Chu Hun.

870
01:27:46,541 --> 01:27:48,916
He planned to assassinate Your Majesty
during the finals.

871
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:51,583
The warriors of Tiger-Roar Clan
found out about it.

872
01:27:51,708 --> 01:27:53,583
He cruelly killed these three men.

873
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:56,000
Even death cannot atone for his offense.

874
01:27:57,375 --> 01:27:58,416
Chu Hun!

875
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:01,541
Do you have any objections
towards what Grand Tutor had said?

876
01:28:08,041 --> 01:28:09,375
I implore Your Majesty

877
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:12,458
to summarily execute this traitor
on the spot.

878
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:15,416
Whatever you say then.

879
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,041
Wait!

880
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:29,750
CHU

881
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:34,041
Dong Yilong from Qingyuan Clan
has something important to report.

882
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:38,958
Let him through.

883
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:55,375
If I may be so bold

884
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:57,916
to ask for a reward from Your Majesty.

885
01:28:58,083 --> 01:28:59,166
What do you want?

886
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:02,541
For years, my clan has been loyal
to the royal court.

887
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:04,833
We didn't expect to have
such a traitor among us.

888
01:29:05,416 --> 01:29:08,750
Please grant me the chance
to fight against this traitor

889
01:29:08,958 --> 01:29:12,041
to kill him myself
and restore our clan's reputation.

890
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:14,333
Your Majesty.

891
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:17,583
This man shows no respect to Your Majesty
and is full of utter nonsense.

892
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:19,541
Guards, take him down.

893
01:29:19,916 --> 01:29:20,916
Your Excellency,

894
01:29:21,125 --> 01:29:24,166
I am now the only candidate
who made it to the finals.

895
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,791
If I don't have to fight,

896
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:29,708
I will immediately become
the Grand Field Marshal of Southern Zhao.

897
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:31,083
In terms of position,

898
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,625
Your Excellency and I
are on the same footing.

899
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:35,583
How impetuous!

900
01:29:35,666 --> 01:29:37,166
You designed this competition system.

901
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:39,166
You can't give yourself
a slap in the face.

902
01:29:44,958 --> 01:29:47,416
- Fight!
- Fight!

903
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:52,208
- Fight!
- Fight!

904
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:57,708
- Fight!
- Fight!

905
01:29:57,791 --> 01:30:03,250
- Fight!
- Fight!

906
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:04,416
- Fight!
- Approved!

907
01:30:14,583 --> 01:30:15,916
Hold on, warriors!

908
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,750
Gentlemen.

909
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:21,125
His Majesty is in trouble.

910
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:22,958
Hurry back to the capital
to protect His Majesty.

911
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:23,875
Protect His Majesty?

912
01:30:23,958 --> 01:30:25,333
Look at that mark on your face.

913
01:30:25,416 --> 01:30:27,500
A nation like this
is not worth saving at all!

914
01:30:27,583 --> 01:30:29,291
The real identity of Grand Tutor Guan

915
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:31,500
is a spy who is hiding in Southern Zhao.

916
01:30:31,916 --> 01:30:33,458
The tattoo marked on our faces

917
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:36,125
is a part of his scheme
to disperse the Eight Clans.

918
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:40,500
Let's go.

919
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:41,583
We're going home.

920
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:43,000
Go home?

921
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:44,333
The nation is about to fall.

922
01:30:44,583 --> 01:30:45,958
Where will our homes be?

923
01:30:57,458 --> 01:31:00,291
I am here to fight the way out with you.

924
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,541
You've come in vain then.

925
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:16,083
What about Jinggang? Did she die in vain?

926
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:33,708
We can't decide how we live,

927
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:35,833
but we can choose how to die.

928
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:41,750
<i>I want to live with dignity</i>

929
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:43,708
just like everyone with freedom.

930
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:46,416
<i>Meeting you and Yilong</i>

931
01:31:46,666 --> 01:31:48,000
was my greatest pleasure.

932
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,208
<i>From the moment the three of us</i>

933
01:31:50,291 --> 01:31:52,166
stood in the arena
and were bound with iron chains,

934
01:31:52,416 --> 01:31:53,916
our fates have been tied together.

935
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,916
That's right.

936
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:21,083
Let's stay alive together.

937
01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:31,750
Start the riot.

938
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,166
Northern Yan warriors!

939
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,250
Attack!

940
01:32:58,125 --> 01:32:59,208
Wait up!

941
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,916
Let's head back to Phoenix City!

942
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:13,583
Protect His Majesty.

943
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:33,375
Protect His Majesty
and return to Lingyan Pavilion.

944
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:16,958
The exit has been sealed off.

945
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:20,958
Your Majesty, we can't get out.

946
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:26,625
I have spent more than a decade
building Lingyan Pavilion

947
01:34:27,375 --> 01:34:29,333
just for today.

948
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,541
Guan, you old bastard!

949
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:07,791
I, Wu Yang...

950
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:09,458
greet...

951
01:35:10,625 --> 01:35:11,708
Your Highness.

952
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:14,666
No!

953
01:36:26,166 --> 01:36:27,083
Bi Nu.

954
01:36:32,916 --> 01:36:34,166
Why did you come back?

955
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:37,500
Actually, back in the forest...

956
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:42,791
I was hoping that
you would ask me to stay.

957
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:52,000
You must...

958
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:55,333
stay alive.

959
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:56,541
Bi Nu.

960
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:04,708
Phosphorus oil.

961
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,083
- Save His Majesty!
- Understood.

962
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:39,666
Save me!

963
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:41,333
Your Majesty, I'm coming!

964
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,083
Save me!

965
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:15,000
It's going to collapse.

966
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:16,208
Save me!

967
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:50,250
Wen Tianyu of Falcon Clan

968
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:53,083
is here to save Your Majesty!

969
01:42:01,875 --> 01:42:03,333
The warriors of all clans

970
01:42:03,666 --> 01:42:04,916
fought hard with high merits.

971
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,500
I grant you fiefs

972
01:42:06,958 --> 01:42:08,791
with a tax exemption for ten years.

973
01:42:08,875 --> 01:42:10,625
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

974
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:12,708
Chu Hun of Qingyuan Clan.

975
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:14,250
In recognition of your valiance,

976
01:42:14,416 --> 01:42:17,416
I bestow you the title
the Grand Field Marshal of Southern Zhao.

977
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:19,041
Thank you, Your Majesty.

978
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:21,083
But I have a presumptuous request.

979
01:42:21,166 --> 01:42:22,458
I hope Your Majesty will grant it.

980
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:23,458
Do tell.

981
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:25,375
Jinggang had utter devotion and loyalty.

982
01:42:25,708 --> 01:42:27,208
Please honor her with a posthumous title

983
01:42:27,416 --> 01:42:29,708
to console the spirits
of the countless unsung heroes.

984
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:31,958
- Granted.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

985
01:42:32,333 --> 01:42:34,208
Dong Yilong has good merits too.

986
01:42:34,291 --> 01:42:36,125
Do you have any wishes?

987
01:42:36,208 --> 01:42:38,000
I wish to visit
Beast King Valley once again

988
01:42:38,375 --> 01:42:39,708
to return the egg.

989
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:40,916
Granted.

990
01:42:41,125 --> 01:42:42,291
Thank you, Your Majesty.

991
01:43:28,875 --> 01:43:31,916
MS. JINGGANG

992
01:44:01,333 --> 01:44:02,708
Are you going back to Qingyuan Village?

993
01:44:02,958 --> 01:44:04,333
I'm heading to Northern Yan first.

994
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:08,791
See you again.

995
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:13,791
Let's not meet again.

996
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:16,291
If we do,

997
01:44:17,625 --> 01:44:19,000
there will be a war between us.

998
01:44:21,666 --> 01:44:22,750
At that time,

999
01:44:23,208 --> 01:44:25,208
I will still be Dong Yilong.

1000
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,541
And I...

1001
01:44:30,375 --> 01:44:31,666
will still be Chu Hun.

1002
01:44:32,305 --> 01:45:32,650

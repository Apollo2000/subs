00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,001
<i>Despite some
encouraging economic news today,</i>

4
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,769
<i>not all working Americans are
feeling a positive impact.</i>

5
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:12,440
Many millennials are still
struggling financially,

6
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,874
especially when compared
to past generations.

7
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,044
<i>Let's bring in my good friend
George "Tyrus" Murdoch...</i>

8
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,646
Millennials blame Baby Boomers
for ruining their lives.

9
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,016
<i>Fifty-one percent of
millennials surveyed by...</i>

10
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,784
<i>...the "Burn Out"
generation, with the stress caused</i>

11
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,487
<i>by several factors
like anxiety, work ethic...</i>

12
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,890
<i>Millennials: Are they just having
a negative overall impact on this economy?</i>

13
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,327
...debt in this country
has topped $1 trillion.

14
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:36,263
No appreciation for the work ethic.
There's also a lack of skills.

15
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,698
...of the recent college
graduates are getting jobs...

16
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,801
<i>...worried about these home
invasion robberies happening...</i>

17
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,503
Is this the next
financial crisis?

18
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,750
<i>They don't even have a clear picture
of the gunmen's faces, minus the masks...</i>

19
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:00,121
<i>In all, Chicago police
have issued two community alerts.</i>

20
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,995
<i>Now police need
your help finding them.</i>

21
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,730
<i>Definitely want to
catch up with this crew.</i>

22
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,422
- <i>I'm in.</i>
- <i>Throw this on before you get out.</i>

23
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,790
- <i>Says you're joining us.</i>
- <i>You are new here...</i>

24
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,626
- <i>You trust me?</i>
- <i>Don't you think you deserve...</i>

25
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,195
- <i>Lance.</i>
- <i>Lance.</i>

26
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,463
Lance.

27
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:47,134
I want to thank you for
agreeing to talk with me.

28
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:51,238
With this book, you will
have the opportunity

29
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:55,842
to tell your story,
from your point of view.

30
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,112
Can you give that to me?

31
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,714
I can give you
my point of view,

32
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,919
but I can't guarantee
you'll understand it.

33
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,886
Why is that?

34
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:10,257
Bit of a generation gap.

35
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,526
You're right.

36
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,496
I've got
a few years on you.

37
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,099
I think you'll
find me up to speed.

38
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:22,669
But I really, really want to
learn something along the way.

39
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,007
You can help me bridge that gap.

40
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,078
Okay.

41
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,981
Okay.

42
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:36,283
When did this all
begin for you?

43
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,086
With a train
ticket to Chicago.

44
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,826
<i>I'll never forget
how much that ticket cost.</i>

45
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,035
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

46
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,704
Yes, I made it safe.

47
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,940
No, Jack's picking me up.

48
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,410
He said he put in
a good word, it'll be fine.

49
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,080
All right, I love you.

50
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,948
Bye.

51
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,924
Hey, Lance.

52
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,659
- Hey, Jack!
- What's new, baby boy?

53
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,562
- Man, it's good to see you.
- What's going on?

54
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,230
Good to see you.
You're looking good.

55
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:24,999
Give me this stuff.
Let's get out of here.

56
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,268
- Thank you, man.
- Of course. Oh, my God!

57
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:28,835
Thanks for picking me up.

58
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,905
Come on, what,
do you think I'm gonna make you walk?

59
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,040
I can't believe
you drive a Porsche.

60
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:34,975
Yeah, man,
it does the trick.

61
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,876
So, how's everyone
back in Dixie?

62
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,811
They're good, man.
They miss you.

63
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,316
If they miss me that much, they can
come up and visit me once in a while.

64
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,717
That's true.

65
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,520
How's life been
treating you, post-college?

66
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,024
- It's been rough.
- Why is that?

67
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,626
I mean, I can't even tell you
how many job interviews

68
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,328
I've struck out on
since I graduated school.

69
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,696
I'm looking for someone
with real-world experience.

70
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,067
- Never worked in an art gallery?
- This is a highly competitive intern position.

71
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:02,336
- You are way too qualified for this.
- If anything changes...

72
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,039
- Gonna give you some valuable...
- We'll keep your resume on file.

73
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,041
Wouldn't you be happier
in your own field?

74
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,809
I hear you.
Job market was kicking my ass too,

75
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:12,046
but that's why I took
matters into my own hands.

76
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,481
It's just a start-up, but, like,
you'll be doing what you love,

77
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:17,017
- I think you'd be perfect for it.
- Thank you, Jack.

78
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,953
I know it's been like
three years or something,

79
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,554
but I've been keeping
my eye out for you.

80
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,855
I saw on Facebook that you
graduated and I was like,

81
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,292
"Shit, who better to
ask than my own cousin?"

82
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,860
I didn't even know that
you were involved in art.

83
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:31,898
Well, I mean,
it's not really about the art.

84
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,968
Just pays well.

85
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,270
Well, then,
what's the business?

86
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,473
How about no more questions, hmm?
Tonight's for catching up, man.

87
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,808
- I'll lay everything out tomorrow.
- Come on, Jack.

88
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,611
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

89
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,179
You told me to come
all the way here

90
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,481
- and you won't tell me anything?
- All right, fine.

91
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:51,518
You'd be working
in acquisitions.

92
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,188
- Acquisitions.
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
- I like that.
- Good!

94
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,158
Acquisitions.

95
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:00,527
Yeah. And just know
that from now on,

96
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,396
your troubles
are officially over.

97
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,134
Thank you, man. Seriously.

98
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:09,203
<i>Jack had always been
ahead of the curve,</i>

99
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,072
<i>so I made it my goal to learn
all that I could from him.</i>

100
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:16,143
<i>Lesson #1: It's all
about who you know.</i>

101
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:19,680
Come on in.

102
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,948
Drop your shit anywhere.

103
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,150
Couch is all yours.

104
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,624
Come on, let's go!

105
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:33,727
- Where are we going?
- Downstairs.

106
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,064
Man, you're really going to love
your co-workers. Guys, open up!

107
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,868
- Jack, is that your truck?
- Yeah, one of them.

108
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,940
Chill! Are you done?

109
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,442
Yeah, I'm done.

110
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,982
- I swear you're a child.
- Oh, don't act like you didn't miss me.

111
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,051
Lance, this is Allie,
the lady of the house.

112
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,485
- Hey, Lance.
- Hey.

113
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,990
That's Stewart,
Chandler, and that's Ellis.

114
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,525
- What's up, bro?
- Hey.

115
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,994
Take a seat.

116
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:08,595
Thank you.

117
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,067
$500 buy-in.

118
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,369
You in?

119
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:22,810
Oh, no. Guys, I don't have 500
bucks to blow on a poker game.

120
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,512
Jack says you're
joining us tomorrow.

121
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,184
Yeah, he is.

122
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,319
Just a trial period.

123
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:35,855
Spot him the five, he's good for it.
Family, right?

124
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,262
Jack, Jack...
where we going, man?

125
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,031
Picking up and
moving a new piece.

126
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,165
Why you looking like that?

127
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,101
You trust me, right?
Come on.

128
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,176
I hope you know art
like he says you do.

129
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,178
Yeah.

130
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,117
You know enough not to get your
clammy hands all over the art, right?

131
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,027
Oh yeah, throw this on
before you get out.

132
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:20,968
So, are you in or not?

133
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,006
Yeah, I'm in.

134
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,397
<i>I was absolutely speechless.</i>

135
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,103
<i>I mean, they were breaking into
these homes in broad daylight,</i>

136
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,071
<i>and they would just
make a sport out of it.</i>

137
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,507
<i>They would steal
anything of value,</i>

138
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,509
<i>and then just destroy
the rest for fun.</i>

139
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:06,647
<i>I mean, these guys were
true artists of destruction.</i>

140
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,450
<i>They could tear down what took
someone else years to build up.</i>

141
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,453
<i>It's very poetic.</i>

142
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,556
<i>But who were they?</i>

143
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,459
<i>Let's start with Chandler
Gaines and Stewart Magenty.</i>

144
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,394
<i>Chandler was
the getaway driver.</i>

145
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,262
<i>He served a short stint
in Afghanistan that</i>

146
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,131
<i>fucked him up pretty badly.</i>

147
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,567
While some US veterans
thought they had left

148
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,671
the worst of the war behind, only to
discover the war came home with them.

149
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,207
<i>And he came home and
couldn't even find a factory job.</i>

150
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,078
Twenty-six percent of vets between
the ages of 18 and 24 are out of work.

151
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:40,147
<i>He felt
rejected and lost.</i>

152
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,683
<i>Just around that time, he
got a call from an old buddy.</i>

153
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,722
<i>Stewart was
the security expert:</i>

154
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:51,926
<i>alarms, cameras, safes.
I mean, he could get past anything.</i>

155
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,694
<i>He'd moved to Silicon Valley
with big dreams</i>

156
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,964
<i>but learned the hard way
that most people don't make it.</i>

157
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,565
<i>The unemployment
rate of the Silicon Valley area</i>

158
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,401
<i>is 8.5% higher than
the national average.</i>

159
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,437
<i>Then he got stuck
working in the nerd squad</i>

160
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,472
<i>at one of those big
electronic chains.</i>

161
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,875
<i>This may not be
the image that comes to mind</i>

162
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,077
<i>when you think of Silicon
Valley, but it's a scene</i>

163
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,412
<i>that's become
all too familiar here.</i>

164
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,849
- What do you think it's worth, art major?
- <i>Next is Allie Tucker.</i>

165
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:20,287
<i>She made sure the message was clear. She was
the glue that kept the whole group together.</i>

166
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,089
<i>Her and Ellis started
dating in college,</i>

167
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,423
<i>where they were
both activists.</i>

168
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,359
- Occupy!
- Wall Street!

169
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,962
- Occupy!
- Wall Street!

170
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,397
<i>And at first, it
was just the two of them.</i>

171
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:32,799
<i>Kind of a Bonnie and Clyde,
but with a message.</i>

172
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:35,302
<i>Here is Clyde
Barrow and Bonnie Parker</i>

173
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,972
<i>who died as they lived:
by the gun.</i>

174
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:42,442
<i>We've got to win by
building a new civil rights movement</i>

175
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:46,580
<i>that's prepared to fight
by any means necessary.</i>

176
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,316
<i>And Ellis Beck
was the puppeteer.</i>

177
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:54,321
<i>His philosophy was simple: Why try to work
for a system that's failed you so horribly?</i>

178
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,357
The richest 1%
controls more wealth now

179
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,961
than at any time in more
than a half century.

180
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,564
<i>And he believed that we were
the wake-up call that the system needed.</i>

181
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,233
<i>So, that's what they did,
and they did it well.</i>

182
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,703
<i>They'd gotten away with it long enough
to get incredibly efficient at it.</i>

183
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:14,808
<i>Lesson #2: When the system is
corrupt, why play by their rules?</i>

184
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,451
- I got you.
- You got it?

185
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,922
How long is the drive?

186
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:29,556
45 minutes.

187
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:31,224
Jack.

188
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:32,859
Your cousin.

189
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:07,361
Lance.

190
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:18,605
Let's go, man.

191
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,823
<i>And Mel Donnelly
is how they made money.</i>

192
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,525
Where's the rest?

193
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,861
We almost got
everything on your list.

194
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,599
You got 15 minutes.

195
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:49,971
<i>Mel owned a shipping container company
in the city, completely legit business.</i>

196
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,839
<i>But every now and then,
he'd fill up one of those containers</i>

197
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,342
<i>with stolen goods,
ship it overseas,</i>

198
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,411
<i>and make an extremely
large amount of cash.</i>

199
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:58,946
- Got it?
- Yep.

200
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,214
Right there.

201
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,389
There was supposed to be
a couple of Van Goghs

202
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,025
and an emerald bracelet.

203
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,593
- Just one Van Gogh.
- Just one?

204
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,362
Yeah,
but the bracelet's in there,

205
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,531
plus a few other things
that weren't listed.

206
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,968
We also got the mail
and a couple of passports.

207
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:22,335
Hmm.

208
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:26,306
So, he's with you?

209
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:30,210
Yeah.

210
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,645
Does he know that?

211
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,247
He's an art major,
helps us tell us what art

212
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,515
is valuable and what's not.

213
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,085
Plus we need the extra hand.

214
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:38,685
He's cool, Mel.
He's my cousin.

215
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,620
Oh, that's supposed
to make me feel better,

216
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,656
that he fell out of
your family tree?

217
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,333
Hello.

218
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,005
What, you find me attractive?

219
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,642
- I, what?
- Well, you won't look at me.

220
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:04,878
That means either you're not
into what's going on here,

221
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,814
or my good looks are
making you uncomfortable.

222
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,184
The first.

223
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,352
Uh-huh.

224
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:16,857
You add someone without asking me and
bring him to my place of business?

225
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:18,625
I didn't see anything.

226
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:21,528
Oh, yeah, you did.

227
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,003
You say one word to anyone...

228
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,506
I dare you.

229
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,376
<i>Comprende,</i> cousin?

230
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,759
Here's another address,

231
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,097
and a list of what I expect
you to find when you go there.

232
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:59,066
<i>When you buy
homeowner's insurance,</i>

233
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,702
<i>anything particularly valuable
has to be listed separately,</i>

234
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:06,540
<i>photos, certificate of
authenticity, proof of purchase...</i>

235
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:09,243
<i>so basically the insurance
companies know what everybody has.</i>

236
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,610
Smile.

237
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,681
<i>All you need is
one dirty agent and...</i>

238
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:16,817
<i>and that's where
Mel comes in.</i>

239
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,855
<i>Mel had a place to sell everything,
and he paid extremely well.</i>

240
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:25,826
<i>Even with the smaller loads,
the mail usually made up the difference.</i>

241
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,362
Yeah, well, I'll
round it up to 30K.

242
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,967
But you better make it
up to me next time.

243
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,269
<i>Credit cards,
social security numbers,</i>

244
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,471
<i>bank account numbers...
and they all knew what he did with those.</i>

245
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,107
What's your name?

246
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,375
Lance.

247
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,946
Lance? Lance what?

248
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:46,948
Zutterland?

249
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,449
Are you asking me?

250
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:53,988
Don't show up here again unless
you're going to pull your weight.

251
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,759
Lock it up when you're done.

252
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:12,706
Aw, come on, man, really?

253
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,175
Again?

254
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:17,844
- Thirty split five ways is six.
- And we get four?

255
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:20,614
You wouldn't know what to do with
this shit if it wasn't for my guy.

256
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,816
And you couldn't do without us,
so fuck you.

257
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,820
You know, we got eight minutes.
Let's wrap it up.

258
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:27,989
Bullshit.

259
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:29,623
Fucking piece
of shit.

260
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,595
I'm sick of loading shit up.

261
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,898
Yeah, yeah, I got it,
come on.

262
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,835
What's wrong
with this guy?

263
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,638
- I think we spooked him.
- He'll be fine.

264
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,910
I get it,
but you wouldn't have come.

265
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:50,912
Of course I wouldn't
have, that was fucked up!

266
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:54,081
Okay, I don't want anything
to do with this, seriously.

267
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:00,388
Here's your cut.

268
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,058
Actually, half of mine. The guys
didn't think you deserved anything

269
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,360
since you stood there with
your thumb up your ass.

270
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,729
- But you're family, so I'm willing to cut you some slack.
- Cut me slack?

271
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,533
I came all the way out here because you
told me you had a legit job offer for me.

272
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,670
The family in the house we robbed? They're
the reason you can't get a legit job.

273
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:19,572
- What are you talking about?
- You're focusing on the wrong part of this.

274
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,742
Come out with us tonight.
I'll tell you what this is really about.

275
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:25,879
- I know what this is really about.
- God, Lance,

276
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:28,748
nobody is forcing you
to do it again, okay?

277
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,919
Just stop, you got
a place to stay,

278
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:34,288
couple bucks in your pocket to
help you look for a legit job.

279
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:37,490
I'm not touching that money, Jack.
I don't want anything to do with this!

280
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,725
- Okay, fine.
- I'm serious!

281
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:39,961
Okay, I know you're serious.

282
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:41,963
You don't have to
touch the money.

283
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,564
Lance, come on, stop.

284
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,033
Look at me.

285
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,802
Hey...

286
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,407
I'm sorry, okay?

287
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,042
I should have told you.

288
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,610
But it's done.

289
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,082
You did it already, so you
might as well enjoy it.

290
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:03,985
And plus, it's
cocktail night tonight.

291
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:05,852
Kind of a big deal.

292
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,256
- Come on.
- <i>Where did they take you?</i>

293
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,292
<i>Where they went
after every heist.</i>

294
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,428
- He okay?
- Yeah, he's fine. He's just shell-shocked.

295
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,231
- He's with us, isn't he?
- Fucking better be after the shit he's seen.

296
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,934
- Just do your pitch and reel him in.
- <i>They celebrated,</i>

297
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,669
<i>and blowing through most of
what they made wasn't uncommon.</i>

298
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,239
<i>I mean, their money didn't
go towards savings or 401(k)s.</i>

299
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,242
<i>What did
they spend it on, then?</i>

300
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,810
<i>Instant gratification.</i>

301
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:32,980
<i>They thought the well
would never dry up.</i>

302
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:35,916
<i>So, easy come, easy go.</i>

303
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:37,418
<i>Exactly.</i>

304
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:42,023
<i>Even though I said no to the
money, I did the math.</i>

305
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:44,624
<i>It would have taken me
three weeks and two days</i>

306
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,793
<i>working those 12-hour shifts
at an art gallery</i>

307
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:49,629
<i>to make as much as what Jack had
offered me after the first hit.</i>

308
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,531
<i>And they were doing
these a few times a week.</i>

309
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,600
Hey, Lance, take a seat.

310
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,705
Lance, I want to thank you
for entertaining all of us.

311
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,142
What am I entertaining?

312
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:04,278
How much do you owe
in student loans?

313
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,414
$60,000.

314
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,581
Fuck me. Wow.

315
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,118
I owe $120,000.

316
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:12,953
Why did you borrow?

317
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:15,356
- What do you mean, why did I borrow?
- Why'd you borrow?

318
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,724
Because I couldn't afford
school, that's what you do.

319
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,826
What were your grades?

320
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:23,164
3.8.

321
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:24,664
Mine were 4.0.

322
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,633
Don't you feel cheated?

323
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,769
We fucking did everything
that they told us to do.

324
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:32,572
We got the grades, we got
to the end of the line.

325
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,706
For what?

326
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,976
What was waiting there, hmm?

327
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,546
Fucking nothing,
no bueno, no good.

328
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,880
Nothing, no job.

329
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:43,284
Yeah, but still,
you're stealing from people.

330
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:44,952
Fuck the people.
Fuck 'em.

331
00:19:45,086 --> 00:19:48,688
The insurance company covers
what that shit is worth.

332
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:50,757
They pay double for it.

333
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:55,396
Listen, everybody knows very few
people have all the wealth,

334
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,198
and they like to
keep it that way.

335
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:00,367
Each generation it gets worse
and worse, ours being latest.

336
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:03,938
We're not just stealing...
we're sending a message.

337
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:08,008
Woo!

338
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:10,277
Look at this.
Look at all that.

339
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,583
Don't you think that you
deserve all of this?

340
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,420
Don't you think that you
deserve all of this?

341
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:22,323
Hey, take one
of these puppies.

342
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:29,430
- Hey, come on.
- What is it?

343
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:30,830
Our generation's
drug, man.

344
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,665
Guarantee he's
not going to do it.

345
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,068
Aw, give him a sec.

346
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,174
<i>Lesson #3: Never
take no for an answer.</i>

347
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:43,244
Hey, Lance,
welcome to cocktail night.

348
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:56,890
Ever done this
before, Lancey-pansey?

349
00:20:57,024 --> 00:20:59,160
So, you do it
through your eye.

350
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:01,929
How do you get that clean line?
I can never do a fucking clean line.

351
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:04,231
You've always been sloppy.

352
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:06,833
I got to do it for Lance.
This is all you, baby boy.

353
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,302
It won't work, man!

354
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,736
Nah, he's fine.

355
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,238
Have I got it on
my face still?

356
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:12,705
Big one. Oh!

357
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,509
A good time, huh?

358
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:19,079
You guys want to stay in here longer?
It smells great. Let's go.

359
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:21,881
<i>I wasn't sure
if I was sold on what</i>

360
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,318
<i>Ellis was saying yet,
but I did know this:</i>

361
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:28,088
<i>for once in my life, I felt
like I was part of something.</i>

362
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:31,091
<i>I wasn't the outsider
anymore, I was accepted.</i>

363
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:32,993
<i>We blew through most of
that money that night,</i>

364
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:35,329
<i>but for a moment,
we were kings.</i>

365
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,235
<i>Lesson #4: Experiences are
better than bank statements.</i>

366
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:27,348
<i>By the time the money ran out, they were
already gearing up for the next hit.</i>

367
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:29,283
<i>And as reckless as
the hits seemed,</i>

368
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,685
<i>they were actually thought
out pretty carefully.</i>

369
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:35,489
<i>Like the truck... I mean,
they ordered six or seven sample decals</i>

370
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:38,192
<i>just so that they would change
them from one hit to the next.</i>

371
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:40,494
<i>Eyewitnesses and street
cameras were less likely</i>

372
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:42,429
<i>to ID the same truck.</i>

373
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,536
<i>And the truck's license plates
were another thing.</i>

374
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,207
<i>How many people actually know their
license plate numbers by heart?</i>

375
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,277
<i>Most wouldn't even notice until
next time they were at the DMV.</i>

376
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:07,955
<i>And if someone sees a shitty
car in a nice neighborhood,</i>

377
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:10,357
<i>I mean, someone's
going to be suspicious.</i>

378
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,993
<i>But a nice car in
a nice neighborhood?</i>

379
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:15,362
<i>No one thinks twice.</i>

380
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,299
<i>After Mel gave
them the address,</i>

381
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:20,567
<i>they'd spend a day
or two casing the place,</i>

382
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:23,237
<i>making sure they knew when
the homeowners left for work,</i>

383
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,740
<i>when the maid showed up, when the
husband came home with his mistress.</i>

384
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,375
<i>All the good stuff.</i>

385
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,213
<i>Once Jack laid this all out for me,
I realized he actually had a point.</i>

386
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:37,384
<i>They'd been doing this for a while without
getting caught, and the money was good.</i>

387
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:41,555
<i>All I had to do was put
away my moral objections.</i>

388
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:44,191
<i>You know, Lance,
you're a pretty good kid.</i>

389
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:46,760
And I'd like to offer
you a job, minimum wage.

390
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,895
You're not going to
get rich doing this.

391
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:52,933
But if you stick to it, you're going
to learn a lot about the art world.

392
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:55,436
And there's a lot
of room to grow.

393
00:23:55,569 --> 00:24:00,007
You just need to focus,
get involved, learn what you can,

394
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,177
and this is a great place
for you to begin.

395
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:19,226
<i>The masks were the
final touch to their message,</i>

396
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,330
<i>that they'd rather be dead
than submit to the system.</i>

397
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:26,100
<i>When Lance
decided to join,</i>

398
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,802
<i>I knew then that
he would never fit our mold.</i>

399
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:32,239
<i>Honestly, he was
the hardest to figure out.</i>

400
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:34,808
What does that mean?

401
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:37,311
Welcome to
the group, baby boy.

402
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,615
Yo, Slim, pull me up.

403
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:46,120
Well...

404
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:50,557
what you go for first
says everything about you.

405
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:57,030
<i>You go for the furniture,
pictures, Dad's golf trophies,</i>

406
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,099
<i>Mommy's wine set.</i>

407
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,368
<i>Everyone had their own thing.</i>

408
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:04,471
<i>Stewart always went
for the glass.</i>

409
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:09,977
He liked to think of himself
as a bull in a china shop.

410
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:13,680
Stewart got picked
on a lot as a kid.

411
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:17,518
<i>He wasn't a bull at all.</i>

412
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:19,186
<i>He was just...</i>

413
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,121
<i>insecure.</i>

414
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:29,463
<i>Jack had this thing
for family pictures.</i>

415
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:32,900
<i>He couldn't stand them.</i>

416
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,969
<i>Especially
the fake happy ones.</i>

417
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,852
<i>Jack had mommy
and daddy issues.</i>

418
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:54,855
<i>They didn't give a shit
about his businesses.</i>

419
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:57,958
<i>They didn't even visit him once
since he moved to Chicago.</i>

420
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:10,204
<i>He felt neglected
and abandoned.</i>

421
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:15,976
<i>When he was destroying
someone else's life...</i>

422
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,181
<i>I think he felt in control.</i>

423
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:28,755
<i>Chandler hated seeing
a kid's room full of toys.</i>

424
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:36,697
<i>Chandler had nothing as
a kid except maybe a beating</i>

425
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,133
<i>from his dad when he got
drunk and pissed off that</i>

426
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,302
<i>he couldn't provide
for his family.</i>

427
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:49,710
<i>Breaking into someone's house
would make anyone feel violated.</i>

428
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:53,046
<i>But messing with
a kid's room...</i>

429
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:57,784
<i>that's what messed the parents up
the most when they'd come home.</i>

430
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:16,503
That shit was fucked up.

431
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:22,509
<i>Ellis never knew his parents.</i>

432
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:26,480
<i>He went from foster home to
foster home until he turned 18.</i>

433
00:27:27,015 --> 00:27:28,582
<i>He always wanted a family.</i>

434
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:30,584
<i>And because of that,</i>

435
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:33,554
<i>he was the thread that
brought them all together.</i>

436
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:37,658
<i>He gave this group of misfits
something to believe in.</i>

437
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:42,629
<i>For me, I couldn't stand
the vanity of it all.</i>

438
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:46,433
<i>Cologne, perfume, suits,
dresses, makeup,</i>

439
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,002
<i>Tom Ford, Gucci, Prada.</i>

440
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:51,204
<i>More and more excess, excess.</i>

441
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:59,446
You said that Lance
was hardest to figure out.

442
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:01,748
<i>Why?</i>

443
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:07,154
<i>He didn't fit in, because he
wasn't scarred by his past like the others.</i>

444
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:11,758
<i>He was just someone who had followed
the rules and got screwed over.</i>

445
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:18,131
<i>In a way, he understood Ellis'
ideas better than anyone.</i>

446
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,835
<i>So, when he had
the chance to destroy,</i>

447
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:24,738
<i>he saw it as an art form.</i>

448
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,278
<i>It had meaning.</i>

449
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:40,387
<i>I think most people deep down
want to do what we did.</i>

450
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,957
<i>But Lance let
himself go all-in.</i>

451
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:44,791
<i>It became his addiction.</i>

452
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:50,230
<i>The excitement, the thrill.</i>

453
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,633
<i>He loved it.</i>

454
00:29:42,582 --> 00:29:46,353
<i>When I finally gave in, it was one
of the greatest feelings I've ever had.</i>

455
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:48,156
<i>I remember looking
up at that house,</i>

456
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:51,458
<i>and as it towered over me
it made me feel so small.</i>

457
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:53,894
<i>And that's how the people who
live there wanted me to feel.</i>

458
00:29:54,028 --> 00:29:57,698
<i>And I realized that's
why they deserved this.</i>

459
00:29:58,598 --> 00:30:01,868
<i>Lesson #5... you know what,
actually, fuck that.</i>

460
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:04,504
<i>They weren't lessons
anymore, they were rules.</i>

461
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:10,444
<i>Rule #5: If they won't let us
dream, we won't let them sleep.</i>

462
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:23,423
<i>I don't know what I was
feeling at that point.</i>

463
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:25,492
<i>I just know it felt right.</i>

464
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:36,570
<i>Maybe we were all in
it for different reasons,</i>

465
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:39,339
<i>but for me it was about
the rush, the high.</i>

466
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:41,341
- <i>It all felt like...</i>
- Stop!

467
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:44,277
Bring that over here.

468
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:53,320
Someone want to explain this?

469
00:30:53,453 --> 00:30:56,157
Must have ripped
when we were loading it.

470
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:58,592
I'm sorry, is that
your explanation?

471
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:01,828
Hey, Zutterland.

472
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,966
What's this worth?

473
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,969
I mean, it's
insured for probably 100K.

474
00:31:08,102 --> 00:31:09,336
Could flip it for around 60?

475
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:14,441
Yeah. What's it worth now?

476
00:31:14,574 --> 00:31:16,043
Probably cost
more to repair it

477
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:17,410
than what it's actually worth.

478
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,546
So, nothing, right?

479
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:24,618
Lance, let's talk.

480
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:47,275
You know, you're
part of this now.

481
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:50,945
Plausible deniability
was over two houses ago.

482
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:53,580
Yeah, I understand that.

483
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:56,650
Take a look at me,
tell me what you see.

484
00:31:57,851 --> 00:31:59,053
A businessman.

485
00:31:59,187 --> 00:32:01,956
Someone 20 years
older than you.

486
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:06,693
I lead a comfortable life, but I have
a lot less left of it than you do.

487
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,029
So...

488
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:10,697
So you don't want to spend
what's left of it in a cell.

489
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:15,036
Exactly.
It's about risk, reward.

490
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:18,438
All that aside, I'm sure you alone
amongst your cohorts over there

491
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:21,708
might have a little compassion for
that piece of destroyed history,

492
00:32:21,842 --> 00:32:26,613
so I want to ask you to help
me keep these kids in line.

493
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:30,117
Can you do that for me?

494
00:32:33,054 --> 00:32:34,421
Yes, sir.

495
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:35,990
Great.

496
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:39,459
You don't got
to call me sir.

497
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:46,666
This is 20K
and another address.

498
00:32:51,571 --> 00:32:54,708
You think your old man
ever held 20K in his hand?

499
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:57,510
No.

500
00:32:57,644 --> 00:33:00,014
Yeah, me neither.

501
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,018
You know what?

502
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,953
Don't tell them what I said.

503
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:09,556
- You know they're going to ask.
- Oh, of course they will.

504
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:12,492
But, you see, that's what I'm doing,
I'm giving you the upper hand.

505
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:14,195
I'm giving you a secret.

506
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,863
You got to keep it from
them, see what happens.

507
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,641
Another address, Mel?

508
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:29,509
Yeah, I gave it to Lance.

509
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:31,678
Cut rate for the ripped art.

510
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:34,015
When you're finished, get out.

511
00:33:34,148 --> 00:33:36,117
You bring me a piece in
that condition again,

512
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,985
we're done here,
you hear me?

513
00:33:48,162 --> 00:33:49,462
<i>What did Mel say?</i>

514
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:51,431
Told you, dude,
he said it's a secret.

515
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,600
Ah, man,
he just playing you.

516
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:56,137
He told me the same thing
when I first came on.

517
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,438
Just another reason why
this shit won't last.

518
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:03,177
Luckily, I got a way out.

519
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:05,413
What did you just say?

520
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:06,981
I said, this
isn't going to last.

521
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:08,983
But what I'm saying
is I have a way out.

522
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:11,252
Mel isn't the only one that's
been buying addresses

523
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:12,585
from that insurance agent.

524
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,322
Ellis bought their
most expensive client.

525
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:18,491
Some paranoid old fuck sitting
on an ungodly amount of cash.

526
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,860
- Cash?
- Enough to last a lifetime.

527
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:23,763
Ellis only sees it as
a last resort kind of thing.

528
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:26,233
That's why my plan is
to hit it without him.

529
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:27,634
Without Ellis.

530
00:34:28,702 --> 00:34:30,537
Without anybody.

531
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,207
What are you
talking about, Jack?

532
00:34:33,341 --> 00:34:36,509
We have something good going here.
Why do you want to screw this all up?

533
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:38,346
What is good about
Ellis getting more money

534
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:40,982
than us on every house, hmm?

535
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:43,317
We don't have to do this today,
but we got to get his phone

536
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:45,419
and the pictures so we're
ready when the time comes.

537
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:48,289
Jack, you're saying "we" like
I'm already a part of this.

538
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:51,158
This is us having enough money to
get out of here before it's too late.

539
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:54,228
No, this is us completely
fucking everybody else over!

540
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:57,098
Man, I thought these guys
were your best friends.

541
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:59,433
You made this huge deal of
introducing them all to me

542
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:01,002
saying how much
I would love them and...

543
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:03,904
These guys do not give
a shit about friends.

544
00:35:04,504 --> 00:35:06,374
They just don't.

545
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:08,909
All right, Jack, no more bullshit.
What do you want from me?

546
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:11,811
Am I here because you guys want
to use me for my art expertise?

547
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:14,181
Do you want me so you can fuck
over your friends? What is it?

548
00:35:14,315 --> 00:35:16,649
Because you have not been
honest with me since I got here.

549
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:18,452
I'm being honest
with you right now.

550
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:21,489
These guys think you're some art
kid who likes doing weird shit,

551
00:35:21,654 --> 00:35:23,757
who likes going to
his little theater plays

552
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,359
and his little art galleries.

553
00:35:25,493 --> 00:35:27,894
You don't owe them anything.

554
00:35:28,895 --> 00:35:30,264
I'm looking out for you.

555
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:32,967
It is just you and me on this.

556
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:35,903
I don't know, man.

557
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:43,543
All right,
all right, throw them down.

558
00:35:43,676 --> 00:35:45,612
Oh, throwing it
down big, baby boy.

559
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:47,348
- What you got?
- Throw 'em down.

560
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,649
- Pair of threes.
- Oh!

561
00:35:49,783 --> 00:35:52,053
- Almost, baby boy, almost.
- So confident.

562
00:35:52,186 --> 00:35:54,388
We should go...
Caitlyn's always on time.

563
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:56,123
No, think
I'm going to stay.

564
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:57,690
I already told them
you were coming.

565
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,559
Plus if you go,
you lose big.

566
00:35:59,692 --> 00:36:00,961
You should take Lance.

567
00:36:03,763 --> 00:36:07,567
What, he hasn't left my apartment since
he got here. You should take Lance.

568
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:09,602
That okay with you?

569
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:12,173
Yeah, I mean, you'd be
doing him a favor.

570
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:16,310
Lance, you want to come hang out
with me and my old college friends.

571
00:36:16,444 --> 00:36:19,879
Nah, I'm all right.
And it'd be kind of weird, right?

572
00:36:22,383 --> 00:36:24,784
Why would it be weird? Hmm?

573
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:27,988
- No, I was saying that...
- It'd only be weird if there was something

574
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,657
- going on between you two.
- Oh, my God.

575
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:33,893
Is there something
going on between you two?

576
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:36,663
- No, there's nothing...
- You're stuttering on your fucking words

577
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:40,201
- like there's something going on. Hang on.
- Sounds like there might be...

578
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,037
Are you sure?

579
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,973
- This is fucking stupid.
- Oh, he's getting a little red in the face.

580
00:36:46,107 --> 00:36:47,740
You got a little
boner going on there?

581
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:50,010
- He's got a little boner.
- We're all friends here.

582
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:51,979
If we can't trust each
other, who can you trust?

583
00:36:52,113 --> 00:36:53,914
- Just go with her, come on.
- You should go.

584
00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:56,117
Because if you're not,
I might go. Is that cool?

585
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,019
- You're not invited.
- Is that cool, Ellis, can I go?

586
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:01,255
You're not worried about me, are you?

587
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:04,125
- Just go. We're all friends, go on.
- All right, I'll go.

588
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:07,027
- Yeah! All right.
- Let's go.

589
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:09,696
- See you back later?
- See you back later.

590
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:11,065
I hope this is good with you.

591
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:13,200
I'm in need,
in definite need.

592
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:16,137
- Wait, who's small, who's big?
- I think you are.

593
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,205
<i>I haven't talked
to Caitlyn in a while,</i>

594
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:20,807
so when she called
I was really curious

595
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,742
to see what she's been up to.

596
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,012
Why has it
been so long?

597
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,281
We're into
different things.

598
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:29,617
- Hi! How are you?
- Hey.

599
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:32,785
- This is Lance. Ellis got tied up.
- Hi. We have a table.

600
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,323
- Nothing prepares you for how much work it is having a kid.
- It's worth it.

601
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:38,791
- I forgot to show you Tibet.
- My God, this is beautiful.

602
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,661
That looks like
a village we stayed at in Haiti.

603
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:43,830
I jumped into the start-up
right after...

604
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:46,400
It's not exactly a dream job
yet, but we're getting there.

605
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,871
What about you, Allie?

606
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:53,607
Um...

607
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,211
Where do I even start?

608
00:37:58,845 --> 00:38:01,881
Africa, mostly.

609
00:38:02,016 --> 00:38:06,020
I got a group of ten investors
together to help develop

610
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:08,255
an affordable option
for clean water.

611
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:09,990
That's amazing!

612
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:12,226
How about you, Lance?

613
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:14,094
I own an art gallery.

614
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:17,298
Okay, I know I took it
a little bit far, but I had to.

615
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:19,133
Didn't you hear all
the stuff they're doing?

616
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:22,036
- They only told you the good stuff.
- What?

617
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:25,072
They only told you the good stuff.
No one actually tells you

618
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:27,274
what they're really
doing in life.

619
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:30,377
You're probably as close
to the truth as they were.

620
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:32,379
It didn't seem that way.

621
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:35,882
Hey, what about that art
gallery that you own, then?

622
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:38,785
Oh, come on, you started it.

623
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,760
How was it?

624
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,797
Where is everyone?

625
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:52,765
They just left.

626
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,268
What's up?

627
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:58,505
- Thanks for hanging out.
- Yeah.

628
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:00,174
You going
back to Jack's?

629
00:39:00,307 --> 00:39:02,910
Yeah, I think I'm
going to call a cab right now.

630
00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:04,777
Thanks again.

631
00:39:13,886 --> 00:39:16,823
Hey, Lance, take a seat.

632
00:39:16,957 --> 00:39:18,392
Nah, man, I'm going
to go back to Jack's.

633
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,461
No, no, no, take a seat.

634
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:23,464
We can talk about what we
spoke about the other night.

635
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:26,233
Okay.

636
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:29,536
You know, uh...

637
00:39:32,306 --> 00:39:34,141
I didn't think that you
were going to make it.

638
00:39:34,275 --> 00:39:38,078
But you, you seem all right.

639
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,481
I think that when you learn
where to stick your nose,

640
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:45,085
and where not to, I think
you'll be a good fit.

641
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:48,989
- Thanks.
- Mm.

642
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:51,558
What did Mel say
to you the other day?

643
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:56,430
Ah, nothing. I think he was
just trying to size me up.

644
00:39:57,398 --> 00:39:58,465
Okay.

645
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:09,410
You know, if Allie ever asks
you to go to a club or a bar...

646
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:12,346
or get her fucking mail...

647
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:15,015
you say no, okay?

648
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:18,885
Yeah. I got it.

649
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,521
I honestly didn't
mean anything by it.

650
00:40:20,654 --> 00:40:22,723
I don't give a fuck
if you meant anything by it.

651
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:24,958
Just make sure it
doesn't happen again.

652
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:26,960
Yeah.

653
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:32,933
Well, if you
got nothing to say,

654
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:35,135
get the fuck out
of my apartment.

655
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,945
<i>Rule #6: There's a thin
line between a friend and an enemy.</i>

656
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:50,984
See what I mean about Ellis?
Not your fucking friend.

657
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:54,321
But still, it doesn't
justify us doing this hit.

658
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:57,658
Look at that guy.

659
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,227
Middle-aged, wife, two kids.

660
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:03,931
Had a nice job, but then, boom,
the economy crashes, loses his job.

661
00:41:04,064 --> 00:41:07,301
And now he's stuck getting me refills
and asking me how I'd like my steak.

662
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:08,769
Why?

663
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:11,238
Because he didn't
have a backup plan.

664
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:14,441
Can I get
that out of your way?

665
00:41:18,412 --> 00:41:21,148
What suggests to you in any
way that I'm done with my food?

666
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,950
Does it look like
I'm fucking done?

667
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,451
Well, you
pointed at me.

668
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:27,588
Uh-uh. Do you still
see food on my plate?

669
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:28,756
Jack, come on, man.

670
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:30,357
You can answer, I'll wait.

671
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:34,995
- You're right. My mistake.
- Yeah, your mistake.

672
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:37,831
It isn't just a steak,
this is an experience.

673
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:40,167
An experience you
just fucking ruined.

674
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,469
Get your fucking
shit together, man.

675
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:47,141
You don't need
to talk to someone like that.

676
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:49,777
I'm sorry, okay. Just listen.
It's all a lesson.

677
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,780
I'm trying to tell you what's going
to happen to you if we don't do this.

678
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:55,215
Forget about the waiter.
I'll give him a nice big tip.

679
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:59,219
What's important is getting the
pictures off of Ellis' phone.

680
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:02,089
I guess it couldn't
hurt to have those photos.

681
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:05,125
Okay. So you're in? I'm only telling
you this shit because we're family.

682
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:08,929
All right, listen, this is what I'm going to do for you.

683
00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:13,000
I'm going to do the same thing I did
for me when I got my first big paycheck.

684
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:15,702
- And what's that?
- You'll see.

685
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,273
This suit was crafted
in Florence, Italy.

686
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:23,076
- One of our best.
- Mm. How's it feel?

687
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,746
- I mean, it fits.
- We'll take it.

688
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,381
<i>Rule #7...</i>

689
00:42:27,514 --> 00:42:30,484
The best things
in life are expensive.

690
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:32,152
Remember that.

691
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:38,225
Your total
is $6,348.52.

692
00:42:48,937 --> 00:42:50,337
You made coffee?

693
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:53,707
No.

694
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,977
I've been thinking.

695
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:01,348
I don't want to
do this anymore.

696
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:07,254
It's not rewarding,
it's unsustainable.

697
00:43:08,455 --> 00:43:10,224
Where is
this coming from?

698
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:13,760
We don't have a plan
for us either, Ellis.

699
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:18,298
I feel like I'm wasting any
potential that I might have had.

700
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:21,635
You don't think
I have a plan.

701
00:43:22,236 --> 00:43:23,905
I've been saving up.

702
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:25,706
And not a small amount, either.

703
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,575
This is not the end result.

704
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:33,714
Every time we do a hit,
I see everything I love about you.

705
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,552
Stick with me, okay?

706
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:41,655
We're not that
far from the end.

707
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,364
Allie, you're late.

708
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,666
Hey, guess what I found?

709
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:31,672
"It appears to be the work
of the same band of youths,

710
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:35,809
leaving a message in
their wake of discontent.

711
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:42,249
Could this possibly be the built up
anger from the Millennial generation?"

712
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:48,355
Can anyone tell me why
writing this load of crap

713
00:44:48,488 --> 00:44:51,625
on a kitchen wall
is a total waste of time?

714
00:44:54,328 --> 00:44:56,730
You accomplish nothing by
destroying these places.

715
00:44:56,863 --> 00:45:00,801
The only thing you're doing is
establishing a pattern, a calling card.

716
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:04,471
A calling card that's gonna help
the police hone you down to:

717
00:45:04,605 --> 00:45:09,077
"The suspects are believed to be
in the age range of 18 to 29."

718
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:10,711
Mel, we get it.

719
00:45:12,013 --> 00:45:14,548
You get it? Good. Good.

720
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:17,851
So, now how many of you
still feel the need to make

721
00:45:17,986 --> 00:45:19,620
these brave statements?

722
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:28,228
Well, are you
guys going to answer him?

723
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:31,732
Come on, this is
what you sold me on.

724
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,901
Yes, Mel, we have
to make our point.

725
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:38,538
Well, let me tell you what your
points are going to get you.

726
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:40,707
While you're out making
these statements, the police...

727
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:43,276
Mel, you just told me
how you wanted me

728
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,445
to get these guys
on track, right?

729
00:45:46,546 --> 00:45:48,382
If you want
us to stay in line,

730
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:50,884
you got to give
us our freedom.

731
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,954
It's what makes it fun.

732
00:45:53,787 --> 00:45:55,455
Well, then there's
good news and bad news.

733
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:58,692
You can keep doing it.
You can keep having your fun.

734
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:01,662
But the bad news is your
little trail of destruction

735
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:04,531
is leading back to my guy
who's giving us this info,

736
00:46:04,665 --> 00:46:08,869
so he's decided he will no longer
supply us with the addresses.

737
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:12,205
That's on you,
from now on.

738
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:19,780
Fuck.

739
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,551
Any of you guys
have an idea on an address?

740
00:46:24,685 --> 00:46:26,319
Just stay in
your fucking lane.

741
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:30,158
I got a guy who caters
to high-end events...

742
00:46:30,323 --> 00:46:32,325
business events,
charity and shit.

743
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:33,794
He can get us in.

744
00:46:33,928 --> 00:46:36,263
Okay, so what do
we do when we get there?

745
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:45,907
<i>Act like them.</i>

746
00:46:46,873 --> 00:46:48,809
<i>With a drink in hand,
but don't get fucked up.</i>

747
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:51,445
<i>Try and find the guy in the
room that everyone's talking to.</i>

748
00:46:51,578 --> 00:46:53,513
<i>Then you get your addresses.</i>

749
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:56,550
<i>Thinking about moving
somewhere out of the city.</i>

750
00:46:56,683 --> 00:46:59,921
Somewhere peaceful.
Where did you say you lived again?

751
00:47:05,525 --> 00:47:08,729
<i>It was funny how many people
acted like they knew who we were.</i>

752
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:11,364
<i>And we consistently got asked
the same question every time.</i>

753
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:13,034
- What department you in?
- Accounting.

754
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:14,701
- Accounting.
- Part of accounting.

755
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,369
- I work in accounting.
- Accounting.

756
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,338
Accounting, huh? You boys
keeping us in line?

757
00:47:18,472 --> 00:47:20,407
Yeah, that's what we do.

758
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,328
Yeah, I used to
be afraid of numbers.

759
00:47:41,461 --> 00:47:43,030
I dabble in
a bit of charity work.

760
00:47:43,164 --> 00:47:44,198
I'm a philanthropist.

761
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:45,332
If you'll excuse me,

762
00:47:45,465 --> 00:47:47,101
I need to step out for a moment.

763
00:47:58,045 --> 00:48:00,248
Thinking about moving out of the
city, somewhere more quiet.

764
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,583
- Any suggestions?
- Well, I live in South Barrington, off Bosworth.

765
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:05,619
<i>Biggest house on the block.</i>

766
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:09,656
New sound system,
custom-made drapery from Spain.

767
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,960
<i>One of the most beautiful
pools I've ever seen.</i>

768
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:20,134
Fuck you!

769
00:48:51,364 --> 00:48:52,399
Ah fuck.

770
00:48:54,936 --> 00:48:56,570
- Oh, shit.
- <i>Guys,</i>

771
00:48:56,703 --> 00:48:58,139
<i>we have a serious problem
outside.</i>

772
00:48:58,272 --> 00:48:59,606
Fuck.

773
00:49:02,043 --> 00:49:03,144
Greetings!

774
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:04,477
How you doing?

775
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:07,014
Ah, so, what's going on?

776
00:49:07,148 --> 00:49:10,051
Ah, the mister
is moving out.

777
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:11,418
- The mister?
- Yeah.

778
00:49:11,551 --> 00:49:13,887
- Got a name?
- Oh.

779
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:17,757
Mr. Stan Lieberman.

780
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:18,859
Ah.

781
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:20,427
- Is he home?
- No.

782
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,664
I'm thinking he's afraid
of being here right now.

783
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:27,801
We were warned to clear out,
too, in case the wife comes home.

784
00:49:27,935 --> 00:49:31,272
Oh. They seemed
like such a nice couple.

785
00:49:31,404 --> 00:49:34,141
- She was too nice, from what I heard.
- What does that mean?

786
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:37,611
You ever see any guys come
around here during the day?

787
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:41,615
Wow. Uh...

788
00:49:41,748 --> 00:49:43,483
that doesn't sound like Linda.

789
00:49:43,617 --> 00:49:45,619
You can call Mr. Lieberman
if you want confirmation.

790
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:48,322
Not about the fact that she was
screwing everything in sight,

791
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:50,523
because you'll have me
in the shit for that.

792
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:52,059
But about the move.

793
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:54,694
- Poor Stan.
- Yeah.

794
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:56,964
Yeah. You think
you know somebody.

795
00:49:57,098 --> 00:49:59,233
Wow! Yeah.

796
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:01,035
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

797
00:50:03,037 --> 00:50:04,804
<i>Guys, we
got to leave now.</i>

798
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:10,644
<i>Despite some close calls,
our plan was working great.</i>

799
00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:14,081
<i>Mel was still paying us, and we were
getting to do everything our own way.</i>

800
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:16,716
<i>As far as I was concerned,
we could do this forever.</i>

801
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,452
<i>I had hoped Jack would see this
for himself and forget about</i>

802
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:22,123
<i>his whole backup plan,
but if anything,</i>

803
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:23,523
<i>it just encouraged him more.</i>

804
00:50:23,657 --> 00:50:25,393
Not bad, huh, Mel?

805
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:28,329
I mean, this shit's just as good as
anything you would ask for, right?

806
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:31,798
The insurance guy, he was just getting
in the way, being too complicated.

807
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:34,368
But, this?
This is airtight.

808
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:36,904
What do you want,
a weekend at the spa?

809
00:50:37,038 --> 00:50:38,838
No, no.

810
00:50:38,973 --> 00:50:40,908
We were just thinking
that, I mean,

811
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:44,178
we're basically doing
two jobs for you now.

812
00:50:44,312 --> 00:50:45,745
We cut out the middleman.

813
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:48,916
Yeah, we did.
So we should make more money, right?

814
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:52,485
You think you
deserve more money?

815
00:50:54,587 --> 00:50:56,057
I mean, yeah.

816
00:50:57,925 --> 00:51:01,162
Why, because you
get the addresses now?

817
00:51:02,129 --> 00:51:06,000
Oh, was that your idea to
get the addresses yourself?

818
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:08,735
- It was Ellis.
- Ellis.

819
00:51:08,868 --> 00:51:11,906
Right, you're not much
of an idea guy, are you?

820
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,975
I drive and
load the truck.

821
00:51:14,108 --> 00:51:15,709
Grunt work, basically.

822
00:51:15,842 --> 00:51:17,544
Except when somebody
speaks to you,

823
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:19,646
then you're full
of brilliant ideas.

824
00:51:19,779 --> 00:51:24,517
Like your absolute classic to talk
to the fucking neighborhood watchman.

825
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:26,553
I was trying to get rid of the guy!

826
00:51:26,686 --> 00:51:29,256
Yeah? What if that guy
could identify you,

827
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,825
- pick you out of a lineup?
- I'm so careful, Mel,

828
00:51:31,959 --> 00:51:34,694
- I'd never get caught in a lineup.
- Maybe, maybe not.

829
00:51:34,828 --> 00:51:37,630
How do I know where the fuck you guys
will end up? You're unpredictable.

830
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:42,236
So I'm supposed to pay you more
money to keep being unpredictable?

831
00:51:43,803 --> 00:51:46,773
That doesn't make
good business sense!

832
00:51:46,907 --> 00:51:48,508
Does it?

833
00:51:50,011 --> 00:51:53,114
Now shut up and get
back to fucking work.

834
00:51:59,053 --> 00:52:02,490
<i>An alert neighborhood watchman
managed a good look at one of the men.</i>

835
00:52:02,622 --> 00:52:05,692
- Oh, great!
- <i>Police released a sketch and ask if anybody</i>

836
00:52:05,825 --> 00:52:08,595
<i>recognizes him to contact
the authorities immediately.</i>

837
00:52:08,728 --> 00:52:11,165
Look at that, I'm so fucked!

838
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:14,402
- Think anybody's gonna recognize you from that?
- What are you trying to say?

839
00:52:14,534 --> 00:52:16,137
Come on, you wish
you looked like that!

840
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,405
Aw, come on, handsome!

841
00:52:17,537 --> 00:52:18,472
Fuck!

842
00:52:18,605 --> 00:52:19,907
Oh shit, come on!

843
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:22,376
Shit. I'm going to go
check on George Clooney,

844
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,877
make sure he's not crying.

845
00:52:24,011 --> 00:52:26,147
Man, he always
gets so sensitive.

846
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,417
Okay, you're right, the sketch is funny.
But today was a close call.

847
00:52:29,549 --> 00:52:31,419
We really gotta be more careful.

848
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:33,487
You don't think Ellis
is being careful?

849
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,122
- I didn't say that.
- You literally just did.

850
00:52:35,256 --> 00:52:38,159
You don't think I
got things under control?

851
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:42,129
Actually, no, you were freaking out
when Chandler was talking to that guy.

852
00:52:42,263 --> 00:52:45,399
- Can we not do this here?
- Yeah, can we not? It's a little intense.

853
00:52:46,467 --> 00:52:49,970
- Fuck both of you.
- Oh, come on, don't be a drama queen!

854
00:52:56,676 --> 00:52:58,678
You're no fucking help.

855
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:05,519
Pass me the phone.

856
00:53:05,652 --> 00:53:08,355
- Look, Jack, he's...
- Come on, this is the only chance we get.

857
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:10,657
Pass it to me now, let's go.

858
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,194
Okay.

859
00:53:13,327 --> 00:53:15,062
- Jack, you got to hurry.
- Shh.

860
00:53:15,196 --> 00:53:17,031
Sure, that sketch
didn't look anything like him,

861
00:53:17,164 --> 00:53:19,100
but that doesn't mean
we shouldn't be more careful.

862
00:53:19,233 --> 00:53:21,701
- Jack, you got to hurry.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

863
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:24,305
Jesus Christ, how many
pictures are there? Okay.

864
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:27,508
That's not the point. Point is when you
say shit like that, it undermines me.

865
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,143
What the fuck does that mean?

866
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:31,112
Okay, we're not boss-employee
in this, Ellis.

867
00:53:31,245 --> 00:53:33,514
- We're a team. Aren't we?
- Are we?

868
00:53:33,646 --> 00:53:36,484
Because if I remember correct,
you told me you wanted out.

869
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:40,321
- Jack.
- Just wait, it's going. Almost there.

870
00:53:40,454 --> 00:53:43,591
So we couldn't even be together
if I wasn't part of this?

871
00:53:44,624 --> 00:53:45,926
Huh?

872
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:47,727
Answer.

873
00:53:47,861 --> 00:53:49,196
It's not that fucking hard.

874
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:53,067
I'm done.

875
00:53:58,472 --> 00:54:00,040
Jack, pull it.
Pull it, Jack.

876
00:54:00,174 --> 00:54:02,176
Wait, wait,
almost there, almost there.

877
00:54:06,447 --> 00:54:09,716
- Wait, no, no, no.
- Okay, we got, got it, got it.

878
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:13,087
Just shuffle, man.

879
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,357
Jeez, I thought there was going
to be bloodshed for sure.

880
00:54:18,926 --> 00:54:21,328
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

881
00:54:24,265 --> 00:54:27,601
Just when you thought things couldn't get more exciting.

882
00:54:27,734 --> 00:54:29,904
- Jack, that was so close.
- Mm-hmm.

883
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:32,640
All right.

884
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:34,942
Some guy called
Daniel Wardlaw.

885
00:54:35,075 --> 00:54:37,144
Jesus, these photos
are out of a magazine.

886
00:54:37,278 --> 00:54:40,581
Most home systems
aren't rated by a UL system.

887
00:54:40,713 --> 00:54:42,917
This is a TL-60.
It can withstand attacks

888
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,751
by common tools for
over an hour.

889
00:54:44,884 --> 00:54:46,287
Define common tools.

890
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,022
Explosives, torches.

891
00:54:48,155 --> 00:54:50,624
I mean, Jack, this thing has
a military-grade vault door.

892
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,493
We might as well
take the whole thing.

893
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:54,861
- It's a room.
- Yeah.

894
00:54:54,995 --> 00:54:57,097
No wonder they're
showing it in a magazine.

895
00:54:58,165 --> 00:55:00,467
Jack, if we're going
to do this, we need Stewart.

896
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:03,504
Mmm, fuck.

897
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:05,239
He's put a
lot of work into this.

898
00:55:05,372 --> 00:55:07,641
It'd take time to
get in that safe.

899
00:55:07,774 --> 00:55:10,077
Digital lock will be
impossible to break.

900
00:55:10,211 --> 00:55:11,811
We'll have to burn our way.

901
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:14,847
- Not easy to get, or cheap.
- Can you do it?

902
00:55:16,016 --> 00:55:17,284
Yeah, I could figure it out.

903
00:55:17,418 --> 00:55:19,886
Great, let's split
it three ways, even.

904
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:24,857
Four. I'm not doing it
without Chandler.

905
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:28,095
Two of you guys and one of me?
I don't know what else you're planning.

906
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:30,130
It's not about you.
It's about Ellis.

907
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:32,266
This is back pay for all
the times he screwed us over.

908
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:34,168
Fine,
if this is just about Ellis,

909
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:36,437
then you should have no
problem bringing Chandler on.

910
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:40,274
Plus I don't want that crazy
PTSD bastard on Ellis's side.

911
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:43,510
You know Ellis is going to be
pissed the fuck off if he finds out.

912
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,547
Yeah, and that's why we're
counting on him not finding out.

913
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,317
- Makes you feel better, you want him, done.
- Okay.

914
00:55:50,451 --> 00:55:53,420
There has to be a connection between
the value of the house and no schedule.

915
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:55,456
This guy is so rich,
he never has to leave.

916
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:57,790
I saw online the guy's
a big donor at a conference

917
00:55:57,925 --> 00:55:59,892
in New York in a couple weeks.

918
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:01,929
Great, we'll do it then.
Can you get us a new car?

919
00:56:02,062 --> 00:56:03,763
No reason we drive
the moving truck in here.

920
00:56:03,896 --> 00:56:05,599
- I can get a van.
- All right, perfect.

921
00:56:05,733 --> 00:56:08,435
Let's do it then. But find out
exactly when this conference is.

922
00:56:08,569 --> 00:56:10,471
I don't want to show up
and find the housekeeper.

923
00:56:10,604 --> 00:56:13,007
No, you guys, this is
supposed to be a backup plan.

924
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,075
Lance, dude,
you are new here, okay?

925
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:17,244
Been dealing with his bullshit
way longer than you have.

926
00:56:17,378 --> 00:56:20,347
- Been trying to tell him.
- I vote we do Wardlaw when he's in New York.

927
00:56:20,481 --> 00:56:22,549
- I second that.
- All right, fine.

928
00:56:22,683 --> 00:56:26,287
- But we should keep doing what we've been doing.
- Lance is right.

929
00:56:27,388 --> 00:56:28,489
For now.

930
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:35,629
She's not answering.

931
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:37,564
We should have Lance try.

932
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:41,801
She's not coming.

933
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:43,237
Does she know
where we're going?

934
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,838
- Yeah, so what?
- She's pissed at you.

935
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:47,975
Nobody's seen her in days,
she could have flipped.

936
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:49,943
I'm not doing this shit
till you figure it out.

937
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:51,912
Doesn't feel right.

938
00:56:56,016 --> 00:56:58,485
Fine, I'll call her.

939
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:02,656
Fucking phone.

940
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,159
Something wrong
with your phone?

941
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:08,395
- Give me your fucking phone.
- You know what? Fuck this, I'm out.

942
00:57:08,529 --> 00:57:11,532
- I'm out, I'm not doing this bullshit.
- Sorry, dude.

943
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:14,435
This is a
fucking joke, right?

944
00:57:15,636 --> 00:57:17,204
You're joking.

945
00:57:18,339 --> 00:57:21,841
- Lance!
- If we're not in this together, it's nothing, Ellis.

946
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:27,114
Telling you,
we gotta hit this place

947
00:57:27,247 --> 00:57:29,583
- whether this old fuck is there or not.
- Fuck it, I'm in.

948
00:57:29,717 --> 00:57:31,952
- I'm ready, let's do this!
- We shouldn't just make a decision

949
00:57:32,086 --> 00:57:34,788
- out of the spur of the moment!
- We gotta hit it now. You heard Ellis!

950
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:37,624
You're putting us in this
position so we have to do this.

951
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:40,260
Come on, you guys, we know that
Allie's not going to the cops.

952
00:57:40,394 --> 00:57:43,130
- I don't know, man, she's a wild card.
- I agree.

953
00:57:43,263 --> 00:57:44,998
Look, if we do this
when Wardlaw is in town,

954
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:47,434
this whole thing goes from
a robbery to a kidnapping.

955
00:57:47,568 --> 00:57:50,137
And we're not here to
hurt anybody, right?

956
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:53,340
Let me call Allie.

957
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:11,225
I'm sorry...

958
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,061
just...

959
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:18,999
for not coming
around as much.

960
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:22,770
I feel like, like I
disappointed you guys somehow.

961
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:25,506
No, sweetie, not at all.

962
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:31,478
I'm sorry, I have
to take this.

963
00:58:31,612 --> 00:58:32,546
Can I be excused?

964
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:33,881
Of course.

965
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:37,084
Sorry.

966
00:58:42,055 --> 00:58:43,323
I can't talk right now.

967
00:58:43,457 --> 00:58:47,361
Okay. Just wanted to call
and check up on you.

968
00:58:48,061 --> 00:58:49,530
They told you to call?

969
00:58:51,165 --> 00:58:53,133
Can we talk about this
in person?

970
00:59:05,045 --> 00:59:06,680
So this is where you grew up.

971
00:59:07,448 --> 00:59:08,549
Yep.

972
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,718
This reminds me
of my aunt's house.

973
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:13,220
Jack's mom.

974
00:59:15,622 --> 00:59:17,724
Why did you
come out here, Lance?

975
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:21,662
Um, just wanted
to check on you.

976
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:26,935
You know, we were
waiting for you, earlier.

977
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:29,236
I'm sure you guys
did fine without me.

978
00:59:30,537 --> 00:59:31,940
We didn't go.

979
00:59:32,072 --> 00:59:33,407
Why not?

980
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,743
I think you guys have been
doing this for so long

981
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:39,246
that they didn't
really feel comfortable...

982
00:59:39,379 --> 00:59:41,081
They thought
I went to the cops.

983
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:44,485
Yeah.

984
00:59:45,786 --> 00:59:47,321
I didn't, but...

985
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:51,725
I just
needed to get away.

986
00:59:54,027 --> 00:59:56,396
But I don't belong
here anymore, either.

987
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:03,070
What did you want to do,
before all this?

988
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,709
Art.

989
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:11,245
- Art?
- Yeah. But...

990
01:00:12,246 --> 01:00:13,547
guess that was
pretty pointless.

991
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,415
No, you're not giving
yourself enough credit.

992
01:00:15,549 --> 01:00:18,418
You knew every expensive
piece in every house,

993
01:00:18,552 --> 01:00:20,521
made Mel a shit-ton of money.

994
01:00:21,522 --> 01:00:24,291
- You did!
- That's true.

995
01:00:24,424 --> 01:00:27,060
But the original plan was to
sell the art and not steal it.

996
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:29,530
Right.

997
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:35,569
What about you?

998
01:00:37,604 --> 01:00:41,508
I always
wanted to help people.

999
01:00:42,609 --> 01:00:43,810
Okay.

1000
01:00:44,946 --> 01:00:46,413
Plan A was to be
a humanitarian,

1001
01:00:46,547 --> 01:00:48,448
and Plan B was to rob houses.

1002
01:00:48,582 --> 01:00:52,085
You're such an asshole.

1003
01:00:52,586 --> 01:00:53,587
But, yes.

1004
01:00:58,158 --> 01:00:59,726
You're coming back, right?

1005
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:04,064
Yeah.

1006
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:07,167
We need you.

1007
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:10,237
I know.

1008
01:01:33,627 --> 01:01:35,095
I'm sorry.

1009
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:39,232
I'm sorry too.

1010
01:01:41,768 --> 01:01:43,370
Are you going out?

1011
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:45,907
I've got to go see Mel.

1012
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,307
Why?

1013
01:01:48,775 --> 01:01:50,410
Why do you think?

1014
01:01:54,514 --> 01:01:56,550
You can come with me
if you want.

1015
01:01:59,653 --> 01:02:00,787
Or not.

1016
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:15,669
Allie!

1017
01:02:15,802 --> 01:02:17,237
Glad you could make it.

1018
01:02:18,505 --> 01:02:20,240
Anybody know what the fuck
we're doing here?

1019
01:02:20,374 --> 01:02:22,209
Got to explain
what happened today.

1020
01:02:22,342 --> 01:02:24,444
- All of us?
- Not you.

1021
01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:27,381
You don't explain shit,
keep your fucking mouth shut.

1022
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:30,350
Hey, right on time.

1023
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:35,322
I think you finally earned
the opportunity to meet

1024
01:02:35,455 --> 01:02:38,325
one of my associates, Teddy.

1025
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:41,795
What do you think of
these jokers, Teddy?

1026
01:02:42,796 --> 01:02:45,332
- Younger than the last crew.
- Uh-huh.

1027
01:02:45,465 --> 01:02:47,135
There's no need to
introduce yourselves,

1028
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:48,769
he already knows
all your names.

1029
01:02:48,902 --> 01:02:51,838
Mel, what happened
today won't happen again.

1030
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:53,807
That's nice.

1031
01:02:54,808 --> 01:02:56,309
Yeah.

1032
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:59,613
You're such a nice group
of kids, tight-knit.

1033
01:02:59,746 --> 01:03:02,349
Friendship, that's
everything, right?

1034
01:03:03,017 --> 01:03:04,785
Like me and Teddy over here.

1035
01:03:06,054 --> 01:03:08,355
But that's not what
we're here to talk about.

1036
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:12,292
We're here to discuss
the possibility that

1037
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:14,528
you may not have
taken the day off.

1038
01:03:15,063 --> 01:03:16,563
Why would we lie to you?

1039
01:03:16,697 --> 01:03:20,534
So you could unload what
you stole on someone else.

1040
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:22,536
We don't have
anybody else like that.

1041
01:03:22,669 --> 01:03:24,237
I mean, it wasn't
that long ago

1042
01:03:24,371 --> 01:03:25,839
you couldn't get
the addresses yourselves.

1043
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:27,808
And you've made
very clear, in the interim,

1044
01:03:27,942 --> 01:03:30,178
that you think you deserve
more than I pay you.

1045
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,947
- Don't we?
- See? There you go.

1046
01:03:33,081 --> 01:03:36,984
But you made the choice to
make it harder for yourselves.

1047
01:03:37,118 --> 01:03:41,122
And for me too because,
since I don't get the addresses anymore,

1048
01:03:41,254 --> 01:03:42,856
I can't even
follow up on this house

1049
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,059
you may or may not
have hit this afternoon.

1050
01:03:45,193 --> 01:03:48,963
Can we just all take a moment
just to get on the same page here?

1051
01:03:49,097 --> 01:03:52,532
Nah. I don't think we're on
the same page about anything.

1052
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:57,637
You see, some of you feel you
deserve more for the same work.

1053
01:03:57,771 --> 01:03:59,806
And others think
they're entitled,

1054
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:03,510
and some of you think leaving
your statement makes you

1055
01:04:03,643 --> 01:04:05,812
as special
as your mommy made you,

1056
01:04:05,947 --> 01:04:08,448
each and every one
a little snowflake.

1057
01:04:08,582 --> 01:04:13,286
But the only thing you have
in common is being lazy.

1058
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,889
We didn't do the hit
because we weren't feeling it.

1059
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:21,495
It was out of caution for
our sake and for your sake.

1060
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,037
Well, why did you have
a bad feeling about it?

1061
01:04:30,171 --> 01:04:31,738
I had a feeling.

1062
01:04:32,272 --> 01:04:33,306
Okay?

1063
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,076
And you should be thanking us.

1064
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,712
Holy shit.

1065
01:04:38,845 --> 01:04:40,580
Mel, today was
just a minor setback.

1066
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:43,383
We're not selling
to anybody else.

1067
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:46,820
I think you're
going to have to.

1068
01:04:47,621 --> 01:04:50,024
Because this, tonight?

1069
01:04:50,657 --> 01:04:53,527
Is the end of this agreement.

1070
01:04:56,797 --> 01:05:01,102
But those friendships,
they just got more important than ever.

1071
01:05:02,003 --> 01:05:04,771
Because if someone considers
going off the tracks

1072
01:05:04,906 --> 01:05:07,074
and ends up talking,
my friend Teddy here,

1073
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:08,341
he doesn't just
know your names.

1074
01:05:08,475 --> 01:05:09,911
He knows where you live.

1075
01:05:10,044 --> 01:05:13,214
He knows where your mom lives,
and what her maiden name was

1076
01:05:13,346 --> 01:05:14,614
before she moved there.

1077
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:17,417
He knows what you drive,
and where you party.

1078
01:05:17,551 --> 01:05:21,721
So if one of you even so
much as whispers my name,

1079
01:05:21,855 --> 01:05:25,927
that man's face will be
the last thing all of you see.

1080
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,630
So, treasure your friendships.

1081
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:38,538
You're a fucking joke.

1082
01:05:40,407 --> 01:05:41,808
Allie, come on.

1083
01:05:44,912 --> 01:05:49,716
You are pushing 50
and peddling stolen shit.

1084
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,054
I think you might
be the problem, Mel.

1085
01:05:53,187 --> 01:05:56,356
You think we'd be doing any of this
if it wasn't for someone like you?

1086
01:05:56,489 --> 01:05:59,160
You can blame me
as much as you want,

1087
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:01,195
but don't lie to yourself.

1088
01:06:01,329 --> 01:06:03,931
If you guys weren't doing this,
it'd be something else just as bad.

1089
01:06:04,065 --> 01:06:05,967
I don't give a fuck
what you think.

1090
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:11,138
I just wanted to remind
you that you are just

1091
01:06:11,272 --> 01:06:13,406
as pathetic as we are.

1092
01:06:23,251 --> 01:06:26,586
<i>Ellis blamed me for what
happened that night, and I get that.</i>

1093
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,488
<i>But I hit the point
where I stopped caring</i>

1094
01:06:28,622 --> 01:06:30,224
<i>if I was acting reckless.</i>

1095
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:33,793
<i>Ellis was pitching the guys on
some bullshit one-last-heist.</i>

1096
01:06:33,928 --> 01:06:35,695
There's a guy
called Daniel Wardlaw.

1097
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:38,266
He has a vault underneath
his house, enough cash to...

1098
01:06:38,398 --> 01:06:39,967
<i>I just tuned them out.</i>

1099
01:06:42,636 --> 01:06:44,972
<i>I didn't give a fuck about
any of this anymore.</i>

1100
01:06:58,386 --> 01:07:01,222
He leaves home for
three or four days next week...

1101
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:02,957
we can hit it then.

1102
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:05,993
My guy is here.

1103
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:10,965
We got to do this now,
before Ellis does.

1104
01:07:11,098 --> 01:07:13,968
- I'm not doing it if someone's home.
- He's 100 fucking years old.

1105
01:07:14,101 --> 01:07:16,703
He's probably not even going to hear us.
We've got to do this.

1106
01:07:16,836 --> 01:07:18,538
Otherwise we're stuck with him.

1107
01:07:18,672 --> 01:07:20,041
<i>The average
human body can handle</i>

1108
01:07:20,174 --> 01:07:22,609
<i>anywhere up to
600 milligrams of Molly.</i>

1109
01:07:24,811 --> 01:07:26,813
<i>I took more than twice
that amount that night,</i>

1110
01:07:26,948 --> 01:07:29,183
<i>and a full three grams
of blow.</i>

1111
01:07:35,089 --> 01:07:37,425
- Something happened to Allie. Ellis!
- Fuck off, ruining my high.

1112
01:07:37,557 --> 01:07:41,262
- Ellis, listen to me, man! We gotta go!
- She's your fucking problem.

1113
01:07:42,196 --> 01:07:44,531
<i>Rule #8: The most dangerous people</i>

1114

<i>are those with
nothing to lose.</i>

1115
01:07:46,434 --> 01:07:50,037
How is she? Take a left.
Gotta get to the hospital.

1116
01:07:50,171 --> 01:07:51,771
We're not going
to the fucking hospital.

1117
01:07:51,906 --> 01:07:53,873
We've got drugs in the car,
we're fucked up.

1118
01:07:54,008 --> 01:07:56,410
- We're going to get fucking busted.
- Jack, please!

1119
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,012
Keep her up,
she'll choke on her throw-up.

1120
01:07:58,145 --> 01:07:59,813
Calm the fuck down, man!

1121
01:07:59,947 --> 01:08:01,781
- We're going to take her home.
- Take her home?

1122
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:05,353
She's OD'ing, what are you
talking about? Jack, please.

1123
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:07,754
Okay, fine, we'll take her
to the fucking hospital.

1124
01:08:15,562 --> 01:08:18,531
Now what?

1125
01:08:18,665 --> 01:08:20,134
- I'm not taking her in.
- Fuck that.

1126
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:22,103
- I'm not fucking going in there.
- I'll take her.

1127
01:08:22,236 --> 01:08:25,239
- Stay in the car.
- If we go in, we're getting arrested.

1128
01:08:25,373 --> 01:08:28,075
- Someone needs to take her.
- Someone's gonna see us, Stewart. Hurry.

1129
01:08:28,209 --> 01:08:30,478
- What the fuck do you want me to do?
- Just get her out.

1130
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:34,081
- Someone needs to stay.
- We do not have a choice. She cannot be in this car.

1131
01:08:34,215 --> 01:08:36,883
- Security is coming. Hurry the fuck up!
- Fuck it!

1132
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:40,553
- Fucking kidding me?
- Lance, stay in the car!

1133
01:08:40,687 --> 01:08:42,889
The fuck is wrong
with you guys?

1134
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:45,059
Oh, fuck.

1135
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:51,032
Hey! I need a stretcher,
I need a stretcher right now!

1136
01:08:53,267 --> 01:08:55,436
Alicia, I need some
assistance over here.

1137
01:08:56,037 --> 01:08:57,905
Coming, I'm coming.

1138
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:04,378
Looks like an OD.

1139
01:09:04,512 --> 01:09:05,645
Let's get her
on the stretcher.

1140
01:09:05,779 --> 01:09:07,547
Open her airways...

1141
01:09:10,951 --> 01:09:12,420
We've still got a pulse.

1142
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:14,055
Let's get her inside.

1143
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,836
I'm ready to be done
with all of this.

1144
01:09:31,571 --> 01:09:32,973
You should be.

1145
01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:36,776
You don't owe them anything.

1146
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:41,082
What's your plan?

1147
01:09:43,284 --> 01:09:44,684
I'll go home.

1148
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:47,021
Pack.

1149
01:09:48,289 --> 01:09:49,356
I'll figure it out.

1150
01:09:50,623 --> 01:09:52,259
I might have something.

1151
01:09:54,495 --> 01:09:58,132
And if it works, it might
be a way out of all of this.

1152
01:09:59,666 --> 01:10:01,068
I really hope so.

1153
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:11,644
Yo, you give
Chandler that gun?

1154
01:10:11,778 --> 01:10:14,848
- No, why?
- Because he's actually shot one before.

1155
01:10:14,982 --> 01:10:18,018
- I think I can shoot a gun.
- Who said anything about shooting?

1156
01:10:18,152 --> 01:10:20,421
- I thought we were just using it to scare him?
- Yeah, exactly.

1157
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:22,822
- See, it doesn't even matter.
- Jesus Christ.

1158
01:10:22,957 --> 01:10:25,092
I can't believe
you brought a fucking gun.

1159
01:10:26,793 --> 01:10:28,529
What do you think,
Lance? Huh?

1160
01:10:28,661 --> 01:10:30,630
I don't give a shit.
That's what I think.

1161
01:10:30,763 --> 01:10:34,034
If you're still upset about Allie,
you need to get the fuck over it,

1162
01:10:34,168 --> 01:10:36,971
- because we got work to do.
- You know what? Fuck you, Stewart.

1163
01:10:37,104 --> 01:10:40,975
I can't just get over the fact we left one of
our best friends to die on a fucking sidewalk.

1164
01:10:41,108 --> 01:10:42,943
Hey, none of us
wanted to do that, okay?

1165
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:44,478
Yeah, none of us
wanted to do it,

1166
01:10:44,612 --> 01:10:45,845
but you fucking did it, right?

1167
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,515
You threw her right
on the street!

1168
01:10:47,647 --> 01:10:48,983
Because I didn't
want to go to jail!

1169
01:10:49,116 --> 01:10:51,318
No one wants to
go to jail, dumb fuck!

1170
01:10:51,452 --> 01:10:53,988
I spent the whole night in the
hospital, and guess where I am?

1171
01:10:54,121 --> 01:10:56,656
- Sitting right in front of you, right?
- Stop!

1172
01:10:58,725 --> 01:11:00,261
Get the fuck out of here.

1173
01:11:00,394 --> 01:11:02,029
Get the fuck out of here.

1174
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,864
Fucking idiot.

1175
01:11:06,267 --> 01:11:08,768
You know what's
the best part about this?

1176
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:10,604
What?

1177
01:11:10,737 --> 01:11:13,073
That I never have
to see you fuckers again.

1178
01:11:13,773 --> 01:11:15,342
You said it.

1179
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:49,842
What?

1180
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:05,693
Alarm's off.

1181
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:07,494
Fuck this guy.

1182
01:12:17,638 --> 01:12:19,073
You deal with the cameras.

1183
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,507
Let's find him.

1184
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:22,009
Copy.

1185
01:12:32,052 --> 01:12:33,921
Don't move.

1186
01:12:34,455 --> 01:12:35,923
Don't you fucking move.

1187
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:38,592
- Jack!
- Get up.

1188
01:12:38,726 --> 01:12:41,262
- Anybody else in the house?
- No, no, please, take what you want.

1189
01:12:41,395 --> 01:12:43,530
- What's the code for the safe?
- What safe?

1190
01:12:43,664 --> 01:12:48,002
- Do not fuck with me! Think I give a fuck about your life?
- 9-12-23.

1191
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:50,237
- Did you catch that, Stewart?
- I got it.

1192
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:52,139
- Get down!
- Jack!

1193
01:12:52,273 --> 01:12:55,808
Give me your fucking hands.
There we go.

1194
01:12:55,943 --> 01:12:57,711
- Jack.
- Get the fuck off me!

1195
01:12:57,844 --> 01:12:59,380
Roll over.

1196
01:13:01,382 --> 01:13:03,783
Don't make a fucking noise.

1197
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:07,820
Come on.

1198
01:13:31,178 --> 01:13:34,214
Open sesame,
motherfucker. Open it.

1199
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:45,959
Holy shit.

1200
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:47,361
Holy shit's right.

1201
01:13:47,494 --> 01:13:49,363
Okay, come on,
let's fill it up.

1202
01:13:59,506 --> 01:14:02,409
- Shit, it's just spilling everywhere!
- So much fucking money.

1203
01:14:10,084 --> 01:14:12,252
I've never seen this
much money in my whole life.

1204
01:14:12,386 --> 01:14:15,656
Fuck Ellis.
Fuck all those assholes.

1205
01:14:16,757 --> 01:14:21,462
We're rich. I'm going
to buy a boat, buy a house.

1206
01:14:22,162 --> 01:14:24,264
Get my mom something nice.

1207
01:14:24,398 --> 01:14:26,500
Take my brother out to dinner.

1208
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:45,419
Yo, yo-yo-yo.
Hold this, hold this open.

1209
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,244
<i>What the fuck is
wrong with you guys?</i>

1212
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:08,937
No!

1213
01:16:18,178 --> 01:16:19,980
- What happened?
- They're locked in.

1214
01:16:20,113 --> 01:16:23,083
- What?
- We got to go, now!

1215
01:16:39,366 --> 01:16:41,168
Go, go, go, go, go.

1216
01:16:42,903 --> 01:16:45,172
What the fuck was that?

1217
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:48,408
- The door shut.
- The door shut?

1218
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:52,713
The door shut by itself?
Lance, did you fucking close the door?

1219
01:16:52,846 --> 01:16:55,215
- Maybe I did.
- Are you fucking kidding me with that shit, Lance?

1220
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:58,552
- Do you not understand they're going to rat now?
- We'll just fucking lay low.

1221
01:16:58,685 --> 01:17:00,754
You're just pissed,
that's why you closed them in there.

1222
01:17:00,888 --> 01:17:04,091
You pissed at me? Because I was
in that car when we threw her out.

1223
01:17:04,224 --> 01:17:07,227
Yeah, well, maybe you were lucky
you weren't in that vault too.

1224
01:17:10,197 --> 01:17:14,501
- Allie, listen to me.
- Allie... Allie, really? My fucking God.

1225
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:16,236
No, I don't have
any time to explain.

1226
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:18,038
Please, you got to pack
your bag right now.

1227
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:19,941
I got to get you out of
the city, Allie, please.

1228
01:17:20,073 --> 01:17:25,379
Goddamn it, Lance, slow the fuck down.

1229
01:17:25,512 --> 01:17:29,017
You gotta be fucking kidding me with this
shit, Lance. Come on, think for a second.

1230
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:33,820
- Stay and watch the fucking van.
- Stay in the fucking van? You're gonna fuck this up for her?

1231
01:17:33,955 --> 01:17:36,991
You don't think she's going to tell
Ellis what we did? What you did?

1232
01:17:37,124 --> 01:17:38,492
The cops are on their way,

1233
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:41,094
so this is not
the time for this.

1234
01:17:41,228 --> 01:17:43,130
You're not going
to listen to me now?

1235
01:17:43,263 --> 01:17:44,431
After all of this...

1236
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,869
I can take you out.

1237
01:17:55,442 --> 01:17:58,478
Don't fucking
touch me, Jack.

1238
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:06,720
Lance, this is embarrassing. What do you
think is going to happen? Give me the keys.

1239
01:18:06,853 --> 01:18:09,590
- What the fuck, Lance?
- Allie, let's go.

1240
01:18:09,723 --> 01:18:12,092
- You asked me to get you out of this shit.
- But how?

1241
01:18:12,225 --> 01:18:14,127
- Tell her why we're here.
- Tell me what?

1242
01:18:14,261 --> 01:18:15,930
- Jack, shut up!
- Tell her.

1243
01:18:16,064 --> 01:18:19,033
We have more cash in the van than
we've ever made, or ever will make.

1244
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:22,502
Stewart and Chandler got caught. You and
Ellis will be next too if you don't come.

1245
01:18:22,636 --> 01:18:25,105
- What did you do?
- We hit the Wardlaw house.

1246
01:18:25,238 --> 01:18:28,709
- That's your plan to get us out?
- It wasn't my plan but that's what happened. Let's go.

1247
01:18:28,842 --> 01:18:30,844
Did I hear
that correct?

1248
01:18:36,084 --> 01:18:39,186
You come to my house and you
pull a fucking gun on me?

1249
01:18:40,654 --> 01:18:43,790
You know, there's
two kinds of dogs.

1250
01:18:43,925 --> 01:18:48,362
There's the ones that bark,
fucking yappy little fuckers.

1251
01:18:48,495 --> 01:18:51,032
Yap-yap-yap-yap.

1252
01:18:51,164 --> 01:18:53,433
And then there's
the ones that bite.

1253
01:18:56,037 --> 01:18:58,705
I know what kind of dog you are.

1254
01:18:58,839 --> 01:19:00,741
Okay, Lance, let's get
out of here, come on.

1255
01:19:00,874 --> 01:19:01,909
Allie.

1256
01:19:03,176 --> 01:19:04,778
Are you coming
with me or not?

1257
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:06,713
She ain't
going anywhere.

1258
01:19:08,382 --> 01:19:09,816
Allie, please.

1259
01:19:12,152 --> 01:19:13,921
Fuck both of you.

1260
01:19:14,655 --> 01:19:16,090
Lance, let's go, come on.

1261
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,557
Come on.

1262
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:03,203
I mean, that just
went great for you, huh?

1263
01:20:09,743 --> 01:20:13,114
Fuck, okay. It all started
with this guy Mel Donnelly.

1264
01:20:13,246 --> 01:20:14,848
He's basically like our boss.

1265
01:20:14,982 --> 01:20:16,316
<i>We got our addresses from Mel.</i>

1266
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,784
- <i>I think he got 'em from...</i>
- Fuck.

1267
01:20:17,919 --> 01:20:21,354
<i>...some insurance guy
from State By State Insurance,</i>

1268
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:24,257
<i>some bullshit like that.
I think they were that guy's clients.</i>

1269
01:20:24,391 --> 01:20:29,796
<i>Once we got the addresses,
we'd stake out a house for like a week.</i>

1270
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:57,290
<i>I know that Jack was as
guilty as Stewart and Chandler.</i>

1271
01:20:57,424 --> 01:21:00,794
<i>But in the end,
he was all I had.</i>

1272
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:09,003
<i>Reports now
indicate that the Wardlaw robbery</i>

1273
01:21:09,137 --> 01:21:12,472
<i>was just one of a string of
robberies in the Chicago suburbs.</i>

1274
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:14,808
<i>At least 70 robberies
from the past two years</i>

1275
01:21:14,942 --> 01:21:17,011
<i>are believed to be
part of the string.</i>

1276
01:21:17,145 --> 01:21:20,781
<i>Four suspects have been apprehended
in connection to the robberies.</i>

1277
01:21:20,915 --> 01:21:23,517
<i>Three more are
currently at large.</i>

1278
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:30,323
Fuck, it's hot in here.

1279
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,698
Dude, I'm going
to get some ice.

1280
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,801
Fuck.

1281
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:10,363
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay, Jack.

1282
01:22:10,497 --> 01:22:11,999
None of this is fucking okay.

1283
01:22:12,133 --> 01:22:14,501
Let's just get some rest.
We'll get out of here tomorrow.

1284
01:22:14,634 --> 01:22:17,470
We can't go anywhere with
our faces all over the news.

1285
01:22:19,472 --> 01:22:21,842
Lance, come on. Sit down.

1286
01:22:32,485 --> 01:22:37,258
I promise, first thing in the morning, we're out of here.

1287
01:22:38,391 --> 01:22:40,861
But we got each other, and right
now, that's all I care about

1288
01:22:40,995 --> 01:22:44,798
because I would not want to be stuck
in this situation with anyone else.

1289
01:22:44,932 --> 01:22:49,103
I know you may not feel the same way.
And that's okay.

1290
01:22:49,237 --> 01:22:52,139
You've been through a lot today
and you're upset, and I get it.

1291
01:22:53,874 --> 01:22:55,910
We've all done
shitty things here.

1292
01:23:00,881 --> 01:23:03,717
I wouldn't have shut that vault
door if you were in it, Jack.

1293
01:23:04,384 --> 01:23:05,619
I know.

1294
01:23:08,055 --> 01:23:10,423
Maybe I would have
deserved it if you did.

1295
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:12,559
Wow.

1296
01:23:12,692 --> 01:23:13,995
But I forgive you.

1297
01:23:15,296 --> 01:23:17,898
Just like you forgive me
because we're family, right?

1298
01:23:21,235 --> 01:23:22,937
First thing
in the morning...

1299
01:23:25,139 --> 01:23:26,673
let's ditch the van.

1300
01:23:28,508 --> 01:23:30,077
We'll get the money
and we'll head west.

1301
01:23:30,211 --> 01:23:31,745
First thing
in the morning.

1302
01:23:31,878 --> 01:23:35,182
But right now, seriously,
we need to get some sleep.

1303
01:23:35,316 --> 01:23:38,785
- Jack, I can't sleep.
- Oh, yes, I think you can.

1304
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:41,655
You'll be out as soon as your
head hits the pillow, I promise.

1305
01:23:41,788 --> 01:23:44,191
It's been a long, long day.

1306
01:23:46,027 --> 01:23:47,061
Go on.

1307
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:54,634
Deep breaths.

1308
01:23:57,771 --> 01:24:02,076
And when the heat's off,
we'll go wherever we want to go.

1309
01:24:03,543 --> 01:24:05,478
Do whatever we want to do.

1310
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,815
Be whoever we want to be.

1311
01:24:10,483 --> 01:24:11,885
We'll go anywhere.

1312
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:14,621
Blend in.

1313
01:24:16,357 --> 01:24:17,691
We'll leave
all this behind.

1314
01:24:17,824 --> 01:24:19,759
It'll be nothing
but a memory.

1315
01:24:22,997 --> 01:24:26,566
Like a dream you can only
remember a few details of.

1316
01:24:27,834 --> 01:24:29,703
We'll finally be free...

1317
01:24:32,505 --> 01:24:34,674
and live the life
we've always wanted.

1318
01:26:04,831 --> 01:26:06,833
<i>I had nowhere to go.</i>

1319
01:26:06,967 --> 01:26:10,337
<i>No money, no chances
of getting away.</i>

1320
01:26:11,205 --> 01:26:13,240
<i>I thought if
I turned myself in,</i>

1321
01:26:13,374 --> 01:26:16,010
<i>they'd have a better chance
of catching Jack.</i>

1322
01:26:18,611 --> 01:26:20,580
Just wasn't fast enough.

1323
01:26:21,881 --> 01:26:25,486
So, do you think that
was Jack's plan all along,

1324
01:26:25,618 --> 01:26:30,757
to bring you in just
to leave you behind?

1325
01:26:33,494 --> 01:26:36,330
<i>It's not really about the art. You did
it already, might as well enjoy it.</i>

1326
01:26:36,464 --> 01:26:38,865
<i>Just you and me on this.
You should take Lance.</i>

1327
01:26:38,999 --> 01:26:41,068
<i>She's a wild card.
Because we're family, right?</i>

1328
01:26:42,269 --> 01:26:43,703
I have no idea.

1329
01:26:45,172 --> 01:26:48,675
- I'm glad I told them everything.
- You get a reduced sentence?

1330
01:26:48,808 --> 01:26:53,414
Yeah. But I shouldn't be in here, anyway.
I'm a political prisoner.

1331
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:55,483
Excuse me?

1332
01:26:55,615 --> 01:26:58,519
Everything I did,
I did in rebellion against this system.

1333
01:26:58,651 --> 01:27:01,788
- I was terrified at the time.
- I didn't see what was going on in front of me.

1334
01:27:01,922 --> 01:27:04,158
It really was all
about the joy of destruction.

1335
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:06,360
- I was in a weak psychological state.
- He used me.

1336
01:27:06,494 --> 01:27:09,330
- I'm happy we were caught.
- Hey lady, you should write that down.

1337
01:27:09,463 --> 01:27:12,765
- It's not gonna get better than that.
- Tell me about Ellis.

1338
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:15,136
You testified
you don't know where he is.

1339
01:27:15,269 --> 01:27:18,838
Do you still feel
the need to protect him?

1340
01:27:20,807 --> 01:27:22,409
Just from me.

1341
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:24,578
Would you do it again?

1342
01:27:24,711 --> 01:27:25,645
Fuck no!

1343
01:27:25,778 --> 01:27:27,515
- No.
- No.

1344
01:27:27,647 --> 01:27:29,883
- What was your sentence?
- Seven years.

1345
01:27:30,017 --> 01:27:32,052
- Thirteen years.
- Nine years.

1346
01:27:32,186 --> 01:27:33,954
- 55 counts of breaking and entering.
- 56 counts...

1347
01:27:34,088 --> 01:27:35,889
- 24 counts...
- One count armed robbery.

1348
01:27:36,023 --> 01:27:37,024
- Robbery...
- Vandalism.

1349
01:27:37,158 --> 01:27:39,260
- Vandalism.
- One kidnapping,

1350
01:27:39,393 --> 01:27:40,427
but I appealed.

1351
01:27:50,037 --> 01:27:52,239
You gave
me only nine rules.

1352
01:27:53,107 --> 01:27:55,209
Is there
a tenth commandment?

1353
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,214
Yeah.

1354
01:28:01,582 --> 01:28:05,319
The tenth commandment is that the rest
of those rules are a bunch of bullshit.

1355
01:28:08,788 --> 01:28:10,457
What was your sentence?

1356
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:13,093
Twelve years.

1357
01:28:15,029 --> 01:28:18,165
Fifteen counts
of robbery and vandalism.

1358
01:28:19,799 --> 01:28:21,602
I'll be out in eight, I think.

1359
01:28:22,369 --> 01:28:26,773
Lance, you mentioned
a generation gap

1360
01:28:26,907 --> 01:28:29,076
when we first started.

1361
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:32,213
I feel obligated to tell you
that I have a pretty fair

1362
01:28:32,346 --> 01:28:34,481
understanding
of your age group.

1363
01:28:34,615 --> 01:28:40,654
Statistics indicate that your
generation, by and large,

1364
01:28:40,787 --> 01:28:44,191
is much more than
an echo of anything.

1365
01:28:44,325 --> 01:28:50,197
Crime among your age group
is down 70%.

1366
01:28:51,065 --> 01:28:55,835
Tobacco and alcohol,
lower than ever.

1367
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:59,806
Much more diverse, so much
more racially tolerant.

1368
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:03,010
You're going to put
people to sleep with that book.

1369
01:29:05,346 --> 01:29:06,947
Okay, Lance.

1370
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:09,450
I have one last question.

1371
01:29:10,451 --> 01:29:12,453
Would you do it again?

1372
01:29:31,305 --> 01:29:32,973
In a heartbeat.

1373
01:29:44,283 --> 01:29:49,283

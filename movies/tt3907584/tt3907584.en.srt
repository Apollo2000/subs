What are you doing?

6
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,833
Violet Markey?

7
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,458
Oh, my God.

8
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,583
Please go.

9
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,250
- Well, I don't think that's very...
- Just go!

10
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,625
What are you doing?

11
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,166
I asked you first.

12
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,666
This is higher than I thought.

13
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,500
Hey.

14
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,708
Hey, look.

15
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,791
Look what I can do.

16
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,541
Stop. Stop!

17
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,166
Hey, Violet.

18
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,875
Hey. Do you have plans this weekend?
My parents are gonna be out of town.

19
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,375
I was thinking about having a party
or something.

20
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,416
Violet?

21
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,625
You OK?

22
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,250
How's everything going?

23
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,916
"Everything" is a really big word.

24
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,375
- Let's start with...
- Do you mean physically?

25
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,166
Emotionally?
Those both could encompass "everything."

26
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,083
Or is "everything" encompassed
by both things?

27
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,916
Are you feeling overwhelmed by anything?

28
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,750
If "everything" is encompassed
by both things,

29
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,125
are they a part of our reality,
or are they somewhere else?

30
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,666
This isn't funny, Theodore.

31
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,250
Finch.

32
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,791
I need you
to take these meetings seriously.

33
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,875
I get it.

34
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,750
OK, do you "get"
that you're on probation,

35
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,541
and in danger of not graduating?

36
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,333
You've already missed
two weeks of school this year.

37
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, um...

38
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,125
- my grandma...
- Stop one second.

39
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,916
I just wanna clarify real quickly.

40
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,125
Is this the grandma who's died four times
over the past three years?

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,333
Five times, actually.

42
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,166
This is the fifth.

43
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,875
She's our miracle.

44
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,000
I really wanna help you,
but you've gotta take this seriously.

45
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:30,541
I mean, you agreed to these terms,
these weekly counseling sessions,

46
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,375
maintaining a B-average,
extracurricular participation.

47
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,500
And I am loving pottery.

48
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,125
Come on, man.

49
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,708
Look, I get it.

50
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,916
If I screw anything up, I'm out.

51
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,541
We're not askin' a lot of you, Finch.

52
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,375
You just need to show up.

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,458
My parents are pissed
because I missed early admissions,

54
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,125
but it's not like that matters, anyway.

55
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,125
I mean, I know I'm gonna get in.

56
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,916
Did you apply anywhere yet?

57
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,083
- Hey.
- Hi.

58
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,875
So, you going to Amanda's party?

59
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,375
It'll be fun.

60
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,208
So I've heard.

61
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,625
It couldn't hurt
to have a little fun, right?

62
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:15,125
Yo, do you think it'd be weird
if I named my kid after a famous person?

63
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,666
Like, if I named him Danny DeVito Donahue,

64
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,416
do you...
do you think he'd be mad about it?

65
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,875
Is "DeVito" the middle name?

66
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,333
Yeah.

67
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,875
Follow-up question:
how high are you right now?

68
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,250
On the scale,
I'd probably say very... this way.

69
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,208
- On the scale...
- Yeah?

70
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,458
What are you looking at?

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,250
Just admiring the social norms
of teenage angst.

72
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,041
- Are you looking at Violet Markey?
- Yep.

73
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,083
Her, um...

74
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,458
her sister died, right?

75
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,333
Yeah, dude.

76
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,291
Hm.

77
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,625
Why ask about her all of a sudden?

78
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,208
I'm intrigued.
A guy can't be intrigued?

79
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,541
Well, a guy can be intrigued.
You being intrigued is weird.

80
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,083
- Definitely weird.
- No, I don't think it's weird.

81
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,333
I wouldn't say "weird."

82
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,500
Wait, if you don't think you're weird,
well...

83
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,333
- Yeah, that's true. Very true.
- She has a point.

84
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,458
- Your guidance counselor called.
- Embryo?

85
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,416
What?

86
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:29,458
His name's Embry. I call him Embryo.
It's the little things, Kate.

87
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,625
Did you do something
I should be worried about?

88
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,375
I'm genuinely offended
by that supposition.

89
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,250
- Finch.
- No.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,500
It's fine. I'll deal with it.

91
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,750
- I hate when you say that.
- Why?

92
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,083
Because what you really mean is
that I'm gonna have to deal with it.

93
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,708
Did you cut class again?

94
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,375
No! For fuck's sake,

95
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,208
just go hang out with Tina
or whatever it is you do.

96
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,166
I'm fine.

97
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,333
OK. I'm gonna be home late.
There's food in the fridge.

98
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,125
- Mm-hmm.
- Real food, Finch.

99
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:00,708
Where's Mom?

100
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,041
She had to go to Chicago for business.
Remember?

101
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,291
- Oh, yeah, right. Cool.
- Love you.

102
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,500
Hey.

103
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,833
- Love you.
- Love you.

104
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,375
No more cheese, Finch!

105
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,666
I'm gonna get the dessert.

106
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,791
Your mother and I know
that today couldn't have been easy.

107
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:41,832
And it wasn't easy for us either.

108
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,958
If you need to talk about it...

109
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,416
I thought this would be nice.

110
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,625
I've been making it for 19 years.

111
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,666
As some of you
will be graduating

112
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,416
and leaving us at the end of the year,

113
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,208
I feel an obligation to make sure
you see the wondrous sights of Indiana

114
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,375
while you can.

115
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:23,458
To wander them, if you will.

116
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:28,791
For your class project, you must report
on two or more wonders of Indiana.

117
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,500
You will write about them,

118
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,750
explain their significance
to you and to Indiana,

119
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,458
and why you chose to visit them.

120
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,250
I want you to take time
on this assignment.

121
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,500
Be thoughtful.

122
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,291
OK.

123
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:45,958
What just happened?

124
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,958
That was so weird.

125
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,500
- What?
- All right, settle.

126
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,625
Violet, are you OK?

127
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,541
All right, let's take our seats.
Let's focus up.

128
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,916
If you're done, Mr. Finch?

129
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,041
Yes, I am done, and can I just say you
are doing a fine job teaching this class.

130
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,125
My young brain is plump with knowledge.

131
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,208
- Thank you, Mr. Finch.
- You're welcome.

132
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,166
As I was saying,

133
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,958
you'll be taking photos,
doing some drawings, capturing detail.

134
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,750
You will be doing this in teams of two.

135
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,458
Can we choose our partners?

136
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes, Mr. Finch.

137
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,791
Hey.

138
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:26,916
So, um...

139
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,500
do you think that there's such a thing
as a perfect day?

140
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,875
I'm the last person you should be asking.

141
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,375
<i> For my geography class,</i>

142
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:05,125
this teacher wants us to do this project
with a partner,

143
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,291
and I just don't wanna do it.

144
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,125
Well, did you ask
for an alternate project?

145
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,750
Yeah, he just... he wouldn't listen.

146
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,250
Well, maybe it's time
to get back out there.

147
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,333
That's the same thing he said.

148
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,166
I know it's hard.

149
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,333
- But you just don't go out anymore.
- That's not true.

150
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,791
When's the last time you hung out
with your friends?

151
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,583
I think it would be really good
if you'd spend some time with them.

152
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,625
So, if I hung out with my friends,
you'd get me outta this assignment?

157
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,083
- You came.
- I did.

158
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,000
- Hey.
- Hi.

159
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,166
- I'm gonna get a drink. Do you want one?
- I'm good.

160

00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,125
OK.

00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:47,875
Yeah...

163
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,500
Hey.

164
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,458
That's a heavy pour.

165
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,708
You know me. I love to rage.

166
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,875
So, you wanna go out back?
Talk a little?

167
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,708
I think I'm gonna leave pretty soon,
actually.

168
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,125
Really? But... I mean, I just got here.

169
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,500
It's just all a little much, you know?

170
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,458
How much longer
are you gonna act like this?

171
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,625
It's been months.
When are you gonna just...

172
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,666
Nice.

173
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,416
Violet, you know
I didn't mean it like that. Just...

174
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,416
<i>Violet Markey,</i>
<i>if you're seeing this, you're still alive.</i>

175
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,708
<i>Please call to confirm.</i>

176
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,791
<i>765-276-8504.</i>

177
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:10,958
<i>♪ I met you standin' on a ledge ♪</i>

178
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,333
<i>♪ What's going on</i>
<i>Inside that pretty head?</i> ♪

179
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,833
<i>♪ I met you standing on a ledge ♪</i>

180
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:23,541
<i>♪ Why don't you come talk to me instead? ♪</i>

181
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,833
Theodore Finch speaking.

182
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,166
Take it down now.

183
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:41,000
The video will self-destruct
in three, two...

184
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,291
<i>...please refresh.</i>

185
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,708
Why would you do that?

186
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,750
I wanna talk about the bridge.

187
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:57,208
<i>"I feel we can't go through</i>
<i>another of those terrible times."</i>

188
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,166
One morning barely qualifies
as a terrible time.

189
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,833
It's a quote.

190
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,833
Virginia Woolf.

191
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,665
OK.

192
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,208
Can I come over?

193
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,250
<i> Now?</i>

194
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,375
Yeah.

195
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,375
So...

196
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,000
I Googled you.

197
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,333
You <i>Googled </i>me?

198
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,625
Yeah, what's with that...

199
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,125
the website that you have
with your sister?

200
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:45,875
Had.

201
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,541
I read some of your stuff.
It's really good.

202
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,125
I don't write anymore.

203
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,791
So, you moved here from California.

204
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,333
How was that?

205
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,166
California to Indiana?

206
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,416
Must've been different.

207
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:12,958
Yeah.

208
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,125
I didn't know that it happened there.

209
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,750
At the bridge.

210
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,708
I'm not, you know...

211
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,916
Suicidal?

212
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,791
You can say it.

213
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Well, I'm not.

214
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,208
Whatever you are, I saved your life.

215
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,250
No, you didn't.

216
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,833
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

217
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,625
Mm... kinda looked like somethin'.

218
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,708
What do you want from me?

219
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,875
I was just thinkin' that
we should be partners.

220
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,041
For the wandering project.

221
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,083
I think it would be good for you
to get out.

222
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,541
Maybe I don't wanna get out.

223
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,125
Maybe I'm sick of people.

224
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,583
Yeah, people are stupid.

225
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:24,416
But the tiniest few
might actually mean well.

226
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,375
Why do you wanna do this with me, anyway?

227
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,625
Because there are places
that need to be seen.

228
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,583
Maybe even the smallest of places

229
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,750
can mean something.

230
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,291
At the very least,

231
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,166
maybe they can mean something to us.

232
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,333
Not an "us."

233
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,625
Maybe they can mean something
to you and me.

234
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,166
Jesus, they call <i>me </i>anti-social.

235
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,291
Two wanders. That's all.

236
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,583
We can do more if you end up loving it.

237
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,666
I won't.

238
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,750
You might.

239
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,541
No, I won't.

240
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,875
Oh, I found another quote for you.

241
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,291
"I feel a thousand capacities
spring up in me."

242
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,750
<i>The Waves. </i>It's from <i>The Waves.</i>

243
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,708
You've got at least
a thousand capacities in you.

244
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,083
Even if you don't think so.

245
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,250
You can keep that one.

246
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,250
You know people call you
"The Freak," right?

247
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,166
Yeah.

248
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,916
Sometimes I say and do things
without thinking, and...

249
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,083
people don't like that,
people like labels.

250
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,583
They like putting you in a box.

251
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,291
They want you to be
who they want you to be.

252
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,250
People don't like messy.

253
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,583
Or different.

254
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,208
My parents are calling Hudson
to get me outta the project,

255
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,166
so you need to find another partner.

256
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,333
OK.

257
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,208
Good night, Violet Markey.

258
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,291
Good night...

259
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,333
Theodore Finch.

260
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,875
Hey. Hey!

261
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,333
Violet.

262
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,125
Hey, where you going?

263
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:11,958
Home.

264
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,083
How'd it go with Hudson?

265
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,833
Not great.

266
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,416
Yeah.

267
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,541
He feels pretty strongly
about participation.

268
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,333
OK...

269
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,541
but no cars.

270
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,125
Come again?

271
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,583
If you wanna do this with me,

272
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,958
you have to figure out another way
because I'm not getting in a car.

273
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,500
<i>Can I ask you a question?</i>

274
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,000
<i>Where would you go
if you could go anywhere?</i>

275
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:19,041
- <i>California.</i>
<i>- But you've already been there.</i>

276
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:21,791
<i>Yeah.</i>

277
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,791
<i>It's warm and it never snows.</i>

278
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,000
<i>Don't you wanna know where I'd go</i>
<i>if I could go anywhere?</i>

279
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,083
<i>Where would you go</i>
<i>if you could go anywhere?</i>

280
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:38,333
<i>I'd go to a place</i>
<i>no one's ever been before.</i>

281
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,208
<i>Undiscovered.</i>

282
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,291
<i>Untouched.</i>

283
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,583
<i>You could come... if you want.</i>

284
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,541
That's it?

285
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,583
Get on up here, Ultraviolet.

286
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,500
No.

287
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,125
Come on.

288
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,958
Come on. The view is incredible.

289
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,333
Come on.

290
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,833
So, what do we think?

291
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,500
The highest point in Indiana.

292
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:39,666
I think if I were here for literally any
other reason than why you and I are here,

293
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,833
I'd be pissed.

294
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:45,083
Oh, wow. Is that a sense of humor
you're hiding in there?

295
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,375
Hm.

296
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:51,750
This is the lamest thing
I think I've ever seen.

297
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,750
It's OK, you know?
You're not going to hell for laughing.

298
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,041
It's pretty lame.

299
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:18,416
It was my sister's birthday.

300
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,791
She would've been 19.

301
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,958
That's why I was at the bridge.

302
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:34,958
Why were you there?

303
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,916
I like to run.

304
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,833
It's pretty early to run.

305
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:45,916
Yeah.

306
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:51,916
Let's jump.

307
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,333
You with me?

308
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,458
All right, on three.

309
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,125
You gotta get ready.

310
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,583
One... there it is,

311
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:05,541
two,

312
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:07,333
three.

313
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:11,875
Wow.

314
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
All right.

315
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,125
These are the things we leave behind.

316
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:19,791
Pick one.

317
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,083
Not that one.

318
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,958
Yeah. That's a good choice.

319
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,166
- What?
- You didn't know?

320
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,083
This is a motherfucking staring contest.

321
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,583
You can't be serious.

322
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,833
Look at my face. I'm really serious.

323
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,708
Fine.

324
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm very competitive.

325
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,083
Me too.

326
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,083
I'm staying over at Tina's tonight.

327
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,166
OK.

328
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:51,875
"OK"?

329
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,041
Yeah.

330
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,125
Usually, that incites a diatribe

331
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,708
- about how Tina's an asshole...
- "Diatribe." Good word.

332
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,833
...and how I shouldn't spend
so much time with her.

333
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,083
Yeah, well, it appears that
my many rantings on this topic

334
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:10,083
have stuck with you,
and I don't have to preach anymore.

335
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,041
What's going on with you?

336
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:14,833
Nothing.

337
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,375
You seem, like...

338
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:19,750
goofy.

339
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,916
You're goofy.

340
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,416
<i>"I feel we can't go through</i>
<i>another of those terrible times."</i>

341
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,083
<i>"Why are women</i>
<i>so much more interesting to men</i>

342
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,500
<i>than men are to women?"</i>

343
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:47,083
<i>"My own brain is, to me,</i>

345
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,333

346
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,250
<i>And why?</i>

347
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:55,958
<i>What's this passion for?"</i>

348
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:11,291

350
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,583
Tell me about Eleanor.

351
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,833
She was bossy... like you.

352
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,333
I like her already.

353
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,708
She hated reading.

354
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,625
She only liked this Italian poet,

355
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,333
Cesare Pavese.

356
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:07,166
He said, "We do not remember days,
we remember moments."

357
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,041
Any time I was having a bad day,

358
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,208
she always said that.

359
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:17,500
Like it was supposed to fix something.

360
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:19,583
Did it?

361
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,666
Yeah.

362
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:24,625
It did.

363
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,666
What else?

364
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,750
She was my best friend.

365
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,375
"Eleanor Markey.

366
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,708
Sister...

367
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,250
best friend."

368
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,625
That's a pretty good epitaph.

369
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,750
What would yours be?

370
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,166
"Violet Markey.

371
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,583
I was here."

372
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:14,708
Yeah, I'm gonna have to steal that one
from you.

373
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,000
You making pancakes?

374
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:26,916
Yeah.

375
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,708
- Blueberry pancakes?
- Yup.

376
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:31,875
Lookin' pretty good.

377
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,333
- Wanna flip 'em?
- Yeah, are they ready?

378
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:37,708
- Yeah. Well, give it a...
- Almost ready.

379
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,458
- These look pretty good.
- Yeah.

380
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,208
OK.

381
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,833
There we go. That one's good.

382
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:49,041
Yeah, there you go. Golden brown

383
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,375
- Hey.
- Hi.

384
00:35:58,458 --> 00:35:59,833
Where've you been?

385
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:03,375
You're not mad that
I'm doing that project with Roamer, right?

386
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:04,666
No.

387
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,875
OK, cool.
'Cause it's, like, it's not a thing.

388
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,083
No, it's fine. I'm doing it with Finch.

389
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,500
With Finch?

390
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,875
Yeah.

391
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,625
You know that he's, like, kinda dangerous?

392
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,916
No, he's not.

393
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,541
He freaked out last year
and threw a chair at Roamer,

394
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,375
like, in the middle of class.

395
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:26,583
He did?

396
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:31,416
Yeah, like, Roamer was fine,
but he's seriously fucked up.

397
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:49,750
So, I was thinking we should check out
the Shoe Tree or the abandoned drive-in,

398
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,125
depending on whatever you're feeling.

399
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,291
What is this?

400
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,916
That's a reminder that sooner or later,

401
00:36:58,291 --> 00:37:00,666
you're gonna have to get back
into the world all by yourself.

402
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,875
But I'm happy pushing you for now.

403
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:08,041
Well, I said
I was only gonna do two, so...

404
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,083
I prefer Private Violet to...

405
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:15,875
Public Violet.

406
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,250
Can you put her on?

407
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:18,166
I'll wait.

408
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,333
Maybe you should
give her some space.

409
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,125
Nice sweater. What's that, a cotton blend?

410
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:30,458
People think this whole "freak" thing
is an act. I know it's real.

411
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,000
Of course it is.

412
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:43,208
How are things?

413
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:46,625
Just your average teenage melodrama.

414
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,708
Come on. You gotta give me more than that.

415
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,875
People are always telling me what I am.

416
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:55,458
A freak.

417
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,375
I get it.

418
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,333
Doesn't mean
it doesn't piss me off sometimes.

419
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:02,250
Well, that must be hard.

420
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:09,916
Come on, man.

421
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,458
Come on. Help me out here.
Come on. Help me out.

422
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,458
Maybe if...

423
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,958
you got a fainting couch,

424
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,625
you could put it right over there.

425
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,625
It would really give me the <i>mise en scène</i>
that I was looking for.

426
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,625
Tie the whole room together.

427
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,250
Did you look into that support group
I told you to check out?

428
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,708
I might've lost the info on that one.

429
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,208
Come on, Theodore. It's a small ask, man.

430
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:43,666
All right. It's Mondays
after school at First Congregational.

431
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,416
- It's called Fresh Approach...
- Ooh!

432
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,041
...and it is confidential,

433
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:52,291
so you can say whatever you want
about anything that's bothering you.

434
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,875
It is a safe space, Finch.

435
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,833
I want you to think about it.

436
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:07,000
What now? Now what are we doing? What?

437
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,375
What's happenin'?

438
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,500
Is this a knock-off?

439
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:10,916
The Post-it?

440
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,625
- This is off-brand.

Hey.

456
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:34,250
Did you sleep out here?

457
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,625
Yeah.

458
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:43,250
I know you said that you were done,

459
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,916
but what if I told you

460
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,041
that I found the best wander
in the state of Indiana,

461
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,208
possibly the world, but...

462
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,500
it was 160 miles away?

463
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:58,291
I'd say have fun,
and I can't wait to hear all about it.

464
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:01,750
Come on! Just give it a chance.

465
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,791
- At least sit inside.
- No, Finch.

466
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,208
I'm not getting in a car!

467
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,291
Look, here. I'll take the keys, and...

468
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:14,083
I swear not to drive faster
than 30 miles per hour through town

469
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,666
or 50 on the interstate.

470
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,833
If at any time you wanna stop, we stop.

471
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,625
You can't keep pushing people.

472
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:25,833
You don't listen. We did it.
The project is over. This is over.

473
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,791
You know this isn't
about a class assignment.

474
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:33,208
This is about you being holed up
in your room or on your stupid bike,

475
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,416
always circling
the same three-mile radius.

476
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,416
And God forbid anyone risk upsetting
"Poor Violet," but...

477
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,708
they're wrong.

478
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,375
Violet.

479
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,250
Is everything OK out here?

480
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,666
- Fine.
- Hey.

481
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,041
Sorry. Hey. Hi, I'm Theodore Finch.
Pleasure to meet you both.

482
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:54,500
- Little early, don't you think, Theodore?
- Yes. Yes, it is early.

483
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:56,000
That is a fair observation.

484
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,916
But you see, I'm your daughter's partner
for the school project,

485
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,375
and we really need to get to this place.

486
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:05,416
Basically, I need her to get into the car.

487
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,625
That car.

488
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,208
That is extremely safe, insured,

489
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:14,208
with an experienced driver who hasn't
gotten so much as a speeding ticket.

490
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,708
This is for a school project?

491
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,958
Yes, sir. We're partners.

492
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:23,583
Well, Theodore, I think
it's Violet's decision to make, but...

493
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,583
maybe not a bad idea.

494
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:41,375
You think she's coming back?

495
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,083
Hey, your guess is as good as ours.

496
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,500
Oh.

497
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,541
No, wait. No.

498
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,708
OK. If I were keys, where would I hide?

499
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:16,833
How are we doin' over there?

500
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:17,833
Fine.

501
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:19,333
You sure?

502
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:21,750
Just stop asking me.
You're making it worse.

503
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:23,958
Talk about something else.

504
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:26,875
Usually, that is my forte.

505
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:29,125
But right now, I got nothin'.

506
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,541
♪ <i>...build this thing together ♪</i>

507
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:51,166
It's a good song.

508
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,083
I don't remember how fast we were going.

509
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,250
It didn't seem fast.

510
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:57,083
Then we were sliding...

511
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:06,291
and Eleanor was saying, "I can't hold on."

512
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,291
And then the car slammed into the bridge.

513
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,541
I just remember the...

514
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,625
the glass hitting my face

515
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,750
and Eleanor screaming.

516
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,291
Then...

517
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,500
after that, it just all goes blank.

518
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,166
When I woke up in the hospital,

519
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,250
my mom told me she was gone.

520
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,291
And that was it.

521
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,291
Still mad you got in the car?

522
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,875
- You really built this yourself?
- Yes, I did.

523
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:43,875
That's impressive.

524
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,791
- All right. Here we go.
- Let's do it.

525
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:49,833
I'm gonna do it.

526
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:51,458
Have a good one.

527
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,833
I can see my house from here.

528
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:08,458
Ah...

529
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:17,541
Woo!

530
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:18,500
Yeah!

531
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:21,416
- That was amazing.
- Good job!

532
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,125
Did it feel fast?

533
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:27,416
Oh, yeah. It's just like the real thing.

that I'm gonna take you to one day.

Oh, yeah?

557
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,833
Yeah, but you're gonna need
to start pullin' your weight, OK?

558
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:36,958
I got you this...

559
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:40,416
just in case you've forgotten
this is a school project,

560
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,458
you have to write about it.

561
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,291
Just me?

562
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,916
You're the writer.

563
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:54,666
"Wander number three..."

564
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,500
No. You gotta start with Hoosier Hill.

565
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,583
You know, you don't have to be so pushy.

566
00:50:58,666 --> 00:51:00,708
You say "pushy," and I hear, um...

567
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,291
"assertive,"

568
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,750
"bold,"

569
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:05,375
"inspiring."

570
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:08,791
Uh... relentless. Irritating.

571
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:10,708
Arrogant.

572
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,041
Sexy.

573
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,666
It's nice to have a friend again.

574
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:29,083
Don't let that go to your head.

575
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:32,458
Too late.

576
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:42,625
You know what I like about you,
Ultraviolet?

577
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,291
What?

578

Hello.

586
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:35,458
Before we get started,
we are nearing D-Day, people.

587
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,166
The day to present your wanderings.

588
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,250
That is correct.

589
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:41,291
Along with your essay,

590
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:46,916
I'm going to be asking each group
to do a presentation to the whole class.

591
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,291
But today, we're talking about
the five themes of geography:

592
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:51,916
location, place...

593
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:04,583
No, but honestly,
I wouldn't even worry about it.

594
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:06,541
- This is just what Finch does.
- Yeah.

595
00:56:07,416 --> 00:56:10,958
I've texted him for the past couple days,
and he hasn't responded.

596
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:12,958
I mean, this is...

597
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:17,833
...I mean, sometimes he's gone for a day,
like, maybe two, but he always turns up.

598
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,958
Yeah, there was that one time
that he was gone for like a week.

599
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:23,083
- Oh, my God.
- He came back and said he went camping,

600
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,416
and he had all these poison ivy spots
on him...

601
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,750
- Covered in spots.
- ...itching, it was like... yeah.

602
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:29,708
It was bad. It was so bad.

603
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:31,291
I think it's pretty fucked up.

604
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:34,750
It's easy to pick up your phone
and respond.

605
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:38,000
It's... that's just something
you have to deal with

606
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:40,041
if you wanna be close with him, you know?

607
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:41,833
It just makes me mad.

608
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,833
Yeah. So, we've been to a lot
of really interesting places so far.

609
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:48,625
Do you have an actual plan,

610
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,875
or you've just kind of been shooting
from the hip?

611
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:54,375
Honestly? I'm just trying to distract her
into spending as much time with me

612
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:56,291
as she can.

613
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,375
And has it been going OK, or...

614
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,333
Yeah, I think so. I've been really...

615
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,791
Look who stopped by.

616
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:04,958
Hey.

617
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:09,083
Did you lose your phone?
I've been texting. I've been calling.

618
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:11,333
Look, let me just show
you this really fast. Hold on.

619
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,916
- You could've taken a second to respond...
- I know.

620
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,541
- ...so I knew you were OK.
- I had to take care of a couple things.

621
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:36,250
It's supposedly bottomless.

622
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:40,125
In the '50s,
a group of boys went swimming here,

623
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,458
and they disappeared.

624
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:44,125
No one ever found their bodies.

625
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:45,833
They drowned?

626
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:48,208
Eh...

627
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,750
maybe.

628
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:54,041
Or maybe they found the other side.

629
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:59,041
They say there's a force in the middle
that sucks you into an underground river

630
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,958
and leads you to another world.

631
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,875
You're not going in?

632
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,041
Oh, of course I am.

633
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:13,958
It'll be freezing.

634
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,208
It'll be fine.

635
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:20,958
You should come in.

636
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:26,958
- No, I'm good.
- What are you afraid of?

637
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:30,416
- It's cold.
- Serious question:

638
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:33,916
what are you most afraid of?

639
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Dying.

640
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:41,750
I don't believe that.

641
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:45,833
Being ordinary.

642
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:50,291
So, don't be ordinary.

643
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:04,333
Oh, my God!

644
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,416
Oh. OK!

645
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:09,833
- Oh, you're right. Fucking freezing!
- Oh, my God!

646
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,291
OK, let's go under.

647
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,791
- Yeah?
- OK.

648
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,625
One, two, three.

649
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:48,875
Marco!

650
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,833
Polo!

651
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:04,166
So, what are<i> you</i> most afraid of?

652
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:09,708
Uh...

653
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,500
I don't know. I guess losing my sister.

654
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:20,875
My mom's gone a lot.

655
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:22,416
My dad left a while ago.

656
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,250
New town, new family.

657
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:29,250
So, Kate's basically all I have.

658
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:39,916
How'd you get that?

659
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,625
I'm going in search of the bottom.

660
01:02:25,166 --> 01:02:26,208
Finch?

661
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:36,000
Finch!

662
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:48,875
Finch!

663
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:18,083
Asshole!

664
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:19,791
What?

665
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:22,750
Do you know how scared I was?

666
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:24,458
Hey.

667
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:26,916
Hey, Violet. Violet, I'm sorry!

668
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:33,708
Violet, I'm sorry.

669
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:35,875
Violet!

670
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:38,458
I thought you drowned!

671
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:42,625
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm sorry.

672
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:45,166
I didn't... I didn't mean to scare you.

673
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:46,625
Well, you did.

674
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:49,958
That was the last thing
that I wanted to do.

675
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,291
Where do you go when you disappear?

676
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,125
Tell me something real about you.

677
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:07,333
Or I'm leaving.

678
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:09,041
OK.

679
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,000
Sometimes I have to go to places
that make me feel like myself.

680
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:18,541
I need to do things that remind me
that I'm in control.

681
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:28,125
My dad used to...

682
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:31,208
get in these dark moods.

683
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,208
Did he do that to you?

684
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,666
I used to be a lot smaller.

685
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:52,791
I used to not know
how to get out of the way.

686
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,541
People don't like messy, right?

687
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,708
- Uh...
- Yeah.

688
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:54,208
- Oh, wait. Yeah, you got it.
- I know, I had it!

689
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:58,958
<i>♪ I met you standin' on a ledge ♪</i>

01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:05,625
Finch.

700
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,958
Finch, wake up. We gotta go.

701
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:09,791
Oh, shit!

702
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:16,207
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My phone died.

703
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:17,500
Violet, inside.

704
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:19,957
- Finch, just... you should go home.
- Don't blame her.

705
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:22,207
- If I could explain. Please...
- It's not his fault!

706
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:23,166
Just get in the house.

707
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,166
- We'll talk about it later.
- I lost track of time.

708
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,332
- Finch!
- If I could...

709
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:29,916
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

710
01:08:30,832 --> 01:08:32,916
It was my fault. I fucked up.

711
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,707
Please, just don't blame her. Please.
I'm sorry.

712
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:38,916
Just... go home.

713
01:09:43,082 --> 01:09:44,457
Do you have any clue

714
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:48,916
what horrible situations we had you in,
in our heads?

715
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:53,582
You have to understand how that felt,

716
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:56,791
your dad and I not knowing where you were.

717
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,166
I said I was sorry.

718
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,875
But you didn't have to treat Finch
like that.

719
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:05,833
Well, he's the boy
that kept our daughter out all night.

720
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:09,125
I kept him out all night, too, Mom.

721
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:42,875
Hey.

722
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,500
Hey, V. Hey, what's up?

723
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,166
How are you?

724
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,958
- Fine.
- It's been a minute. What's been going on?

725
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,500
I can't deal with you right now.

726
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,125
Is everything OK?

727
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:56,666
Honestly, I don't know.

728
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:00,041
I'm not tryin' to be an asshole,

729
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,875
but you should know
what you're getting into.

730
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,375
- I do.
- No, you don't.

731
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:06,458
- He...
- Let's go.

732
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,333
- Where've you been?
- You know why she's hangin' out with you?

733
01:12:09,416 --> 01:12:10,500
She's tryin' to fix you.

734
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,916
Shut up, Roamer! Just...

735
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,333
You have no idea
who he really is, do you? He's a freak!

736
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,958
- Call me a freak one more time.
- You're a fuckin' freak.

737
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:23,958
Finch!

738
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:25,125
Finch!

739
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:26,208
Stop!

740
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,000
Finch!

741
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:32,250
Finch! Yo, let him go, man. Get off him.

742
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,916
Finch, stop! Stop!

743
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:42,000
Oh, my God!

744
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:44,291
What the hell?
He almost killed him.

745
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:57,750
He's crazy.

746
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:17,708
Fuck!

747
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:20,625
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

748
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:37,958
Anything?

749
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:43,916
Guess he's gone again.

750
01:13:47,916 --> 01:13:50,083
I've been friends with the guy
since minute one,

751
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,333
and I haven't waited
for his call in years.

752
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,958
He just...

753
01:13:56,541 --> 01:13:58,458
gets in this mood sometimes, and...

754
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:01,750
it's hard, you know?

755
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,833
He's not easy,

756
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:08,875
and everybody who gets close to him
gets burned out.

757
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,291
So, why do you stick around?

758
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:20,750
Because...

759
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:24,916
'cause I love him.

760
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:30,041
He thinks everybody leaves him
and I won't do that.

761
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,625
This is what we do.

762
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:37,875
I'm gonna get mad,
he's gonna come back and apologize,

763
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:40,041
and it'll be like it never even happened.

764
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:52,958
Hey.

765
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:55,958
Is... is Finch here?

766
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:58,250
Did something happen?

767
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,166
Yeah, come on in.

768
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,375
I'm Lindsay.

769
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:11,833
Um... I'm OCD and just got diagnosed
with a social anxiety disorder,

770
01:15:11,916 --> 01:15:14,666
so being here with everyone
is not intimidating at all.

771
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:19,458
Last year, I started cutting myself.

772
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:24,000
I still deal with it, but I'm here.

773
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:26,750
I'm so sorry.

774
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:28,125
No worries. Have a seat.

775
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,291
Hi, I'm Bradley.

776
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:41,000
Um... I am ADHD, OCD,
BPD, DID, and bipolar.

777
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:42,500
Yeah.

778
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:46,458
Um... you'd think some of those
would cancel the others out, but...

779
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,666
Yeah, my week's been OK.

780
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,916
I've been watching
a lot of basketball lately,

781
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,291
and that's been helping a lot, so...

782
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,833
Good.

783
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:57,916
Hi. Welcome.

784
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:02,875
Um...

785
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:07,666
I'm, uh... Theodore Finch.

786
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:10,833
No labels.

787
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:16,125
Not really sure why I'm here.

788
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:18,125
Uh...

789
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:25,041
I guess it's 'cause I...
I got in this fight at school and,

790
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,541
like,

791
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,541
I was there, but I wasn't there.

792
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:33,625
I was watchin' myself, and...

793
01:16:37,875 --> 01:16:38,833
uh...

794
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:41,833
I-I-I just get a little lost sometimes.

795
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,333
I run... a lot.

796
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,458
Sometimes that helps.

797
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Kind of.

798
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,708
I don't know. Is that enough?

799
01:16:58,666 --> 01:16:59,541
Sure.

800
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:01,750
Thanks. Glad you're here.

801
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:07,833
Amanda, why don't you go ahead?

802
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,250
I'm Amanda.

803
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:14,791
I'm bulimic.

804
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:18,125
I've tried to kill myself twice.

805
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:23,291
I think about it almost every day.

806
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:41,416
Hey, have you heard anything yet?

807
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,333
- No.
- OK.

808
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:48,416
I gotta go to work. I'm gonna be late.
But you should stay.

809
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:50,750
Why does he keep doing this?

810
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:55,708
I don't know.

811
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:02,250
Have him call me
when you hear from him, OK?

812
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:04,875
Yeah.

813
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:06,583
- Bye.
- Bye.

814
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:14,291
<i>I heard you beat the shit outta Roamer.</i>

815
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,083
Why do you keep doing stuff like that?

816
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:20,541
Aren't you tired of people
talking about you all the time?

817
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:23,916
People are always gonna talk.

818
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,166
It's their specialty.

819
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:30,583
Are you OK?

820
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:37,666
I don't know.
I feel like I keep messing things up,

821
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:42,166
and I'm not sure
I know how to not do that.

822
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:43,625
Does this work?

823
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:47,458
It's better than the alternative.

824
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,250
<i>Your girlfriend's pretty worried</i>
<i>about you.</i>

825
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,625
She's been at the house all afternoon.

826
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:44,041
What's going on?

827
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:52,166
I don't... really remember...

828
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:55,250
Dad that well.

829
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,708
And everything I do...

830
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:03,458
remember is... is bad.

831
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,375
Are there any...

832
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:11,750
good memories you have of him?

833
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:17,916
Well, the fact that he would
beat the shit out of us

834
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,833
kind of negated all the good times.

835
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:29,500
But why was he like that?

836
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:32,333
Was he like that because of us? Was he...

837
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:34,875
like that because of Mom?

838
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:37,375
He was like that
because he was a shitty person.

839
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,833
There has to be a reason, though.

840
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:43,000
Because if there's a reason,
then he could get better.

841
01:20:43,083 --> 01:20:44,166
Something or...

842
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,416
someone could make him better, right?

843
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,875
I don't know. Who cares?
Dude, he's someone else's problem.

844
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:54,000
Why are you asking me about Dad?

845
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,291
What's going on, Finch?

846
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,458
Come on. You can talk to me, man.

847
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:10,125
Nothing, Kate.

848
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:11,291
Sorry. Nothing.

849
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:13,666
I'm good.

850
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,916
Are you sure?
Because I have to open the bar,

851
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,750
- but I can find someone to cover me.
- I'm good.

852
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,500
You know I love you, right, Theo?

853
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:30,666
I know.

854
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:14,875
You scared me.

855
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:22,916
What is all of this?

856
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,250
I'm trying to focus.

857
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:29,583
Focus on what?

858
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:32,291
On staying awake.

859
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:37,000
I don't understand what that means.

860
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:40,166
Sometimes I...

861
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,333
go blank.

862
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:46,875
I... get into these dark moods.

863
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:50,666
I think too fast
to keep track of anything,

864
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,041
and then it's like...

865
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:57,041
all my thoughts are gone at once.

866
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:01,791
And sometimes,
if I put 'em up there, I can...

867
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:04,333
focus and slow down, but...

868
01:23:07,291 --> 01:23:09,791
I can't right now. I can't.

869
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:12,958
OK.

870
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,916
And this usually works.

871
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,791
Maybe there's too much clutter.

872
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,708
I can fix it. I just...

873
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:27,000
I just need time to figure this out.

874
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:33,291
- I'm trying to help you.
- I don't need your help!

875
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:36,541
This is on me! This isn't about you!

876
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,708
You need to tell me what's wrong.

877
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:45,458
You don't get it.

878
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:52,666
You're right.

879
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,083
I don't get it.

880
01:23:58,416 --> 01:24:00,041
Don't you know, Violet?

881
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:04,875
I'm "The Freak."

882
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:10,291
I'm fucked up!

883
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:24,000
I need you to leave.

884
01:24:29,916 --> 01:24:30,875
Go!

885
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:41,708
<i>Hey, it's Finch. Leave a message.</i>

886
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:45,375
Hey, Finch. Um...

887
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,250
I'm sorry.

888
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,833
I'm just sorry that I pushed.

889
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,666
And... I...

890
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,666
just need you to come back.

891
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:03,500
I just really need you to come back, OK?

892
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,916
Hey, kiddo.

893
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:33,625
Hey.

894
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:40,833
Dad?

895
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:44,166
Yeah?

896
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:49,500
On Eleanor's birthday...

897
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:54,875
I...

898
01:26:57,833 --> 01:26:59,250
I wasn't really thinking.

899
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:06,708
I found myself at the bridge.

900
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,416
I was standing on a ledge.

901
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,583
That's how I met Finch.

902
01:27:19,666 --> 01:27:20,958
He found me there.

903
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:26,875
He saved me.

904
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:31,208
You... you weren't gonna...

905
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:32,666
I'm OK.

906
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:36,958
I was...

907
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:39,041
confused.

908
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:42,541
I was sad.

909
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:46,458
I'm OK.

910
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:51,458
I'm better now.

911
01:27:54,916 --> 01:27:55,750
Wow.

912
01:27:57,958 --> 01:28:00,000
Well, I'm glad Finch was there.

913
01:28:02,875 --> 01:28:03,875
Me too.

914
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:11,750
I just wish I knew where he was.

915
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,666
Well...

916
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:20,708
you two have been a lot of places.

917
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,875
Is there any place else he might go?

918
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,666
Finch!

919
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:02,000
Finch!

920
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:06,666
Finch.

921
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,416
Marco!

922
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:56,541
On behalf of Finch's family,

923
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:59,000
I wanna thank you all
for being here today.

924
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:03,750
We've gathered to celebrate
and to honor the memory of one

925
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:07,875
who will be incredibly missed
because he has been so dearly loved.

926
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:10,541
The events of these past few days...

927
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,250
I'm gonna say bye.

928
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:49,875
OK, we'll wait for you.

929
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:54,125
Hey.

930
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:17,541
I should've been there.

931
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:33,625
I miss him.

932
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:39,500
Just so fucked.

933
01:33:52,791 --> 01:33:54,125
I had no idea.

934
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:01,041
Sorry that I wasn't there for you.

935
01:34:04,125 --> 01:34:05,125
It's OK.

936
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:08,875
I didn't know how to tell you.

937
01:34:14,208 --> 01:34:15,375
I would miss you.

938
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:21,833
Yeah, I know you would.

939
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:07,750
"Travelers' Prayer Chapel,

940
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:11,458
created as a sanctuary

941
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:15,208
for the weary travelers
to stop and rest along their way.

942
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,375
It was built in memoriam to those

943
01:36:18,458 --> 01:36:21,208
who have lost their lives
in auto accidents...

944
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:27,916
and as a place for healing.

945
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:34,833
We remember those who are no longer here,

946
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:37,791
who were taken from us too soon,

947
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,333
and who we will always keep
in our hearts."

948
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:33,333
<i>I used to be worried</i>
<i>about everything.</i>

949
01:37:36,333 --> 01:37:38,041
<i>Things that seemed meaningful...</i>

950
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:41,000
were actually meaningless.

951
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:43,583
I worried about life.

952
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:50,041
I worried about what would happen
if I let myself feel again.

953
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:54,166
I thought I didn't deserve to.

954
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:02,166
Then...

955
01:38:03,625 --> 01:38:05,166
without really knowing...

956
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,583
I changed.

957
01:38:15,333 --> 01:38:18,875
I wasn't worried
about what would happen if I lived.

958
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:23,291
I was worried about
what would happen if I didn't.

959
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:26,958
What I would miss.

960
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:30,708
I worried about not remembering.

961
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:34,333
Not remembering all of the moments...

962
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:41,541
all of the places...

963
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,166
...and that's because of Finch.

964
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:54,833
Because he taught me to wander.

965
01:39:00,166 --> 01:39:03,166
<i>He taught me</i>
<i>that you don't have to climb a mountain</i>

966
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:05,000
<i>to stand on top of the world.</i>

967
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:13,875
<i>That even the ugliest of places
can be beautiful,</i>

968
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,666
<i>as long as you take the time to look.</i>

969
01:39:25,166 --> 01:39:27,041
<i>That it's OK to get lost...</i>

970
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:32,916
<i>as long as you find your way back.</i>

971
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:41,833
<i>But in learning all of that,</i>

972
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:45,166
<i>I missed seeing
something more important...</i>

973
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:49,791
<i>seeing Finch.</i>

974
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:55,000
<i>I missed that he was in pain.</i>

975
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:06,291
<i>I missed that he was teaching me
all along</i>

976
01:40:07,541 --> 01:40:08,750
<i>how to move on.</i>

977
01:40:14,125 --> 01:40:15,583
<i>Finch was a dreamer.</i>

978
01:40:18,708 --> 01:40:20,458

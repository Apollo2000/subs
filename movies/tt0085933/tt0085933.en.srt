2
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,586
Wake up, Lawrence.

3
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,964
What is it?
Why so early, Sergeant Hara?

4
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,507
Hurry up!

5
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:54,003
- What does he want?
- I'll find out.

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,346
What?

7
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:59,049
You don't have to take orders
from this man, you know.

8
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:01,635
Well, I'm the liaison officer.
So I'm liaising.

9
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,103
What did he say?

10
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:05,306
You're sure you know what
you're doing, old man?

11
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:07,641
Yes, and what ever this is,
it's important to him...

12
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:09,935
that I see it.

13
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,901
Let's go, Sergeant.

14
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,279
You don't understand.
Only Lawrence understands.

15
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:14,648
- I'll keep an eye on them, sir.
- Very good.

16
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,030
Bastards!

17
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,022
Attention!

18
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,732
Face forward!

19
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,817
Present arms!

20
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,613
Order arms.

21
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,700
As you were!

22
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,913
Step aside.

23
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:29,908
A disgraceful incident has occurred.

24
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:33,745
I will deal with it myself.

25
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:38,041
If it's a secret, why show me?

26
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:42,379
I want you to witness it.

27
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:45,924
- Know what he did?
- This Dutch soldier?

28
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,347
Not him, he was in a cell
for stealing bananas.

29
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:56,768
- The Korean guard?
- Of course.

30
00:03:57,144 --> 00:04:00,814
Kanemoto, tell this British
officer what you did.

31
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:03,358
Kanemoto, come on!
Say it!

32
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:08,322
Say it! You, Kanemoto!

33
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:15,746
Why don't you?
Are you too ashamed?

34
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,797
You know now Lawrence?

35
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:31,803
Last night he stole into the
cell of that Dutch boy.

36
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:38,852
Kanemoto, show us how you used
this thing of yours.

37
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:44,149
Show us how you used it on this
white fellow's ass.

38
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:48,153
Just do it for us now!

39
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:54,159
Untie him.

40
00:04:56,453 --> 00:05:02,668
Kanemoto! Do it! Hear me? Now!

41
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:09,549
Has your dainty thing become
too shrunken to be potent?

42
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:17,057
If you can bugger him again
you may comit Harakiri.

43
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:19,476
Have you gone mad?

44
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:27,150
You haven't seen a Japanese
until you've seen Harakiri.

45
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:30,278
I don't want to watch it!

46
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,742
Do you want me to hate the Japanese?

47
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:38,495
I'll do it!

48
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:44,918
Stop it! For God's sake,
stop it!

49
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:47,129
Lawrence, out of the way!

50
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:51,174
Haven't you shamed him enough?

51
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:56,471
Shame? He didn't even resist
being raped!

52
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:00,058
Can you get up?

53
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:04,730
You're Dutch, aren't you?

54
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:08,942
De Jong, sir. Karel De Jong.

55
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:12,070
Now you'd better
sit down.

56
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,990
Now tell me
what happened.

57
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:22,539
In the beginning he came in to
dress this wound of mine.

58
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:25,125
For three days, every night.

59
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:32,757
He was, he was very kind.

60
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:39,514
But then last night, he suddenly...

61
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:44,603
Captain Yonoi! This is
Colonel Lawrence! Come quickly!

62
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,327
Kanemoto, I'll assist you.

63
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:04,539
Stop it!

64
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,627
Watch this!

65
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,630
Sergeant Hara...

66
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:18,678
Attention!

67
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:37,072
What's going on?

68
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,408
Sergeant Hara is going
to execute this man!

69
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:45,163
- This is not your concern.
- Then why bring me here?

70
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:51,044
- Who ordered this execution?
- This is not an execution.

71
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:56,466
Kanemoto is trying to comit
suicide for his crime.

72
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,637
And you ignore it?

73
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,348
Out of compassion.

74
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:08,979
His family is poor. If we deem
his death an accident...

75
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:13,316
they will get a pension.

76
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:17,487
What crime has he committed?

77
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,698
Let me report in private.

78
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:37,173
I've no time now. I'm due at a
military trial in Batavia.

79
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:40,343
Make your report later.

80
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:11,374
This way, sir.

81
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:30,059
- Captain Yonoi is here, sir.
- Let him in.

82
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:45,992
I'm Captain Yonoi.
I'm here for the trial.

83
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:52,165
We are very honoured to have
Captain Yonoi here today.

84
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:56,461
This is Colonel Fujimura,
President of the court.

85
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:02,634
- Pleased to serve with you.
- Good to have you here.

86
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,471
My name is Iwata.

87
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:11,100
The military situation here
is very serious.

88
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:15,188
Your service is important.

89
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:24,113
Gentlemen, the defendant is
a very difficult man.

90
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,375
All rise to attention!

91
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:10,118
Before the court is the
case of Jack Celliers.

92
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:15,164
Your name is given
as Jack Celliers.

93
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:17,500
Is that correct?

94
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:22,880
- Why shouldn't it be?
- What do you mean by that?

95
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:29,971
Answer the question!
Is your name Jack Celliers?

96
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:33,850
I've answered that question
about a hundred times.

97
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:40,523
Read the charges.

98
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:45,194
The prisoner, Jack Celliers,
a Major in the British army...

99
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:49,198
parachuted with four men into...

100
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,204
the Banten Valley.

101
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:58,207
They waged guerilla warfare.

102
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:02,211
On October 16, they attacked a
Japanese transport unit.

103
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:09,218
They took ammunition, killed
PFC Takeshi Tazaki, then...

104
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:14,599
they wounded Corp. Sawafuji
and four others.

105
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:20,104
His crime is covered by
martial law regulations.

106
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:26,235
We recommend a death penalty...

107
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:31,574
as prescribed in section 1

108
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:40,917
Accordingly, he should receive
the death penalty...

109
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:47,048
as prescribed in Section 1,
chapter 5 of the regulations.

110
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,596
How do you plead?

111
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:58,267
Not guilty. I'm not a criminal.

112
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:01,938
I am a soldier in
His Majesty's army.

113
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,567
One month ago I came out of the
Djaja Sempoer mountains.

114
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:10,947
I surrendered to Colonel Utsumi
of the Imperial Japanese Army.

115
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:16,244
I was imprisioned at Sukabumi.
3 days in solitary confinement.

116
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:20,206
Then I was questioned
by Lieutenant Ito.

117
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:23,459
He asked me my name and
rank and I told him.

118
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:28,297
Then Lieutenant Ito asked me:
"Is that true?"

119
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,303
I replied: "of course, it is.
I'm with the British army. "

120
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:37,473
Do you mean you would never
give a false name?

121
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:41,018
Let me ask you something.

122
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,105
Why would a man who's about to
die give a false name?

123
00:13:44,397 --> 00:13:48,526
A Japanese soldier who's caught
would give a false name.

124
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:55,116
But then, a Japanese soldier would
never submit to being caught.

125
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:57,535
- He would prefer to die.
- But then, I'm not a Japanese.

126
00:13:58,286 --> 00:14:02,665
Why did you refuse to tell
about yourself?

127
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,252
You must tell us your
past history.

128
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:08,462
My past is my business.

129
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:20,891
What was the reason for
giving yourself up?

130
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:22,768
You've just read it,
haven't you?

131
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,189
Your men said they'd kill the villagers
if I didn't give myself up.

132
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:33,529
- How many men did you have?
- None.

133
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:35,990
- Liar!
- I'm not a liar.

134
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:42,121
I had four men but they
were killed in action.

135
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:47,001
We know you led a group
of native soldiers.

136
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:49,253
We are bound to find them
sooner or later.

137
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:51,714
Why don't you confess your crime?

138
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:55,342
I've never led natives.

139
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:58,012
Look, why don't I have a defense counsel?

140
00:14:58,429 --> 00:15:02,016
Exactly what kind of trial
are you giving me?

141
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:04,351
This whole thing's a bloody farce.

142
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:11,067
Erase all those remarks.

143
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:17,364
May I question him?

144
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:28,042
"To be or not to be.
"That is the question,

145
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:34,715
The prosecutor said that you
landed in Java by parachute.

146
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,718
Under whose orders?

147
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,930
Under the orders of the
Supreme Commander of...

148
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:42,973
His Majesty's forces in India.

149
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:45,810
Were you not under the
commander of Java?

150
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:49,772
You know I came to Java in August.

151
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:53,901
You know the commander in
Java was captured in March.

152
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:57,780
- You know Captain...
- Captain Yonoi.

153
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:04,411
If this man fought in India
as a legitimate soldier.

154
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:09,959
Then we must treat him as
a prisioner of war.

155
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:14,171
- We have no proof.
- I believe this man.

156
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:19,760
What were you asked when captured?

157
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:22,888
Were you asked how you were
intended to conduct a...

158
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:24,890
guerilla war with only five men?

159
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:29,937
Well, I suspect they thought we
were an advance party...

160
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:32,982
for a new campaign presumably
the invasion of Java!

161
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:36,110
They wanted to know dates
and places.

162
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:38,362
What did you say?

163
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:40,531
I said I thought they
were crackers.

164
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:41,574
What?

165
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:45,619
- I thought they were mad.
- And then?

166
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:51,375
Then they stopped feeding me,
and started beating me.

167
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,420
Can you prove that you
were beaten?

168
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:15,482
Put on your shirt!

169
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:19,194
No more questions!

170
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:39,173
The court retires.

171
00:17:56,065 --> 00:18:01,445
A delay this long usually means
a firing squad.

172
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:07,493
But nowadays new officers like
to try out their swords...

173
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:09,578
on white necks.

174
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:35,938
The verdict in your case
has been postponed.

175
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:38,023
We shall wait for
further instructions.

176
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:56,166
Stand up.

177
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,653
Good day for it, sir.

178
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:27,614
Yes.

179
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:32,786
You have a family waiting
for you, Corporal?

180
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:39,918
Wife and two kids, sir.
One with, one without.

181
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:46,174
How's about yourself, sir?

182
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:12,117
- Tea?
- Yes, I'd like that.

183
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:47,027
The prisoner, sir!

184
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:09,758
Can you guess
what I'm thinking?

185
00:21:11,635 --> 00:21:14,846
Yes, I think so. Can you?

186
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:51,883
He's rebellious to the end.

187
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:56,888
You have been found
guilty on all charges.

188
00:21:57,472 --> 00:22:01,810
The sentence will be carried
out without delay.

189
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:04,980
Make him ready!

190
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,317
- I don't need any help.
- Leave him alone!

191
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,238
I've practiced walking for years.

192
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,373
Firing position!

193
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,802
I don't need that.

194
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:42,601
The blind fold is for
the firing squad!

195
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:47,522
So they don't look into
your eyes as you die.

196
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:52,861
Let him be.

197
00:22:57,616 --> 00:23:00,118
Prepare to fire!

198
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:06,750
Firing positions!

199
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:13,757
Fire!

200
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:24,184
That's a good one!

201
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:39,783
Sergeant Hara...

202
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:43,870
Sergeant Hara...

203
00:23:47,957 --> 00:23:53,963
Lawrence, can't you let me sleep?

204
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:55,882
I'm sorry.

205
00:23:56,883 --> 00:24:02,138
I was just now riding on top of
Marlene Dietrich's tummy.

206
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:04,140
In a hideway in Manchuria!

207
00:24:10,897 --> 00:24:13,525
I must talk to you.

208
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:19,489
Why's he here?

209
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:25,161
I want you to protect him.

210
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:26,871
Why?

211
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:29,874
My men heard about him.

212
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:35,547
- I told you not to talk!
- I didn't.

213
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:42,220
There were Japanese soldiers
and Korean guards there.

214
00:24:43,054 --> 00:24:44,973
You accuse Japanese...?

215
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:48,852
It was probably the guards.

216
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,522
Don't you realize that everyone
is going to know?

217
00:24:53,815 --> 00:24:55,191
I understood.

218
00:24:56,151 --> 00:25:00,864
Will all your men want to
bugger him now?

219
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,409
Is it true that English men
are all homosexuals?

220
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:06,369
Don't be stupid.

221
00:25:06,953 --> 00:25:11,207
Listen, I need your help.

222
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:15,211
A Japanese never asks help
from an enemy.

223
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:19,841
Hey, are you a homosexual?

224
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:25,638
He says you are a homosexual.
Are you?

225
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,724
No sir. I am not.

226
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:29,809
He's not.

227
00:25:30,643 --> 00:25:32,937
You all fear homosexuality!

228
00:25:33,646 --> 00:25:36,024
A samurai doesn't fear it.

229
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:41,905
Wars create friendships
amongst men.

230
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,827
That hardly means that all
soldiers become homosexual.

231
00:25:49,996 --> 00:25:53,917
You are not soldiers,
you are prisoners!

232
00:25:55,668 --> 00:26:00,924
So you lack discipline,
and you beg favours.

233
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:04,802
- Shame!
- Sergeant Hara...

234
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:11,643
I've nothing to be ashamed of.

235
00:26:15,229 --> 00:26:16,981
A new prisioner has arrived.

236
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:22,111
Another queer's here!

237
00:26:27,075 --> 00:26:33,164
I've brought a prisoner from
the military prison in Batavia.

238
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:42,173
I'm Sergeant Gengo Hara.
I'll take over.

239
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:53,976
Your name and rank?

240
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,689
Celliers, Jack. Major,
British Army.

241
00:26:58,064 --> 00:27:01,442
Celliers? Jack Celliers?
Straffer Jack?

242
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:05,113
Good morning, Colonel.

243
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:13,162
You bastard!

244
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:17,500
Stop it!

245
00:27:25,216 --> 00:27:28,928
No! Stop it! Stop it!

246
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:38,396
You! Officer! Do you
know this man?

247
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:43,025
We served together in Libya.
We fought the Germans.

248
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:45,361
Take him to the sick bay.

249
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:56,998
What kind of a man is he?

250
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:59,417
Is he a close friend of yours?

251
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:03,004
No. He's not a close friend, no.

252
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:08,009
- What kind of a soldier is he?
- He's a fine soldier.

253
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:13,055
We had a nickname for him
in the 8th Army.

254
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:15,057
We called him straffer Jack.

255
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,684
Straffer is a kind of um...

256
00:28:18,936 --> 00:28:22,064
it's very difficult to translate.
Straffer is um...

257
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:25,443
This is astonishingly
difficult sometimes.

258
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:29,697
In any case,
he was a soldier's soldier.

259
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:33,826
Why are you so
interested in him?

260
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:44,045
- What did the doctor say?
- I didn't talk to the doctor.

261
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:45,713
You fool!

262
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:48,424
Lawrence, I want him in good
health as quickly as possible.

263
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:50,676
That's an order!

264
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:54,680
You don't have to order me
to look after a sick man.

265
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:58,225
I will send the Japanese
medic to see him.

266
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:02,939
Why are you so concerned
about Major Celliers?

267
00:29:03,022 --> 00:29:05,066
Send our medic.

268
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,411
- The commanding officer, sir.
- Let him in.

269
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:28,339
You spend more time with these
Japs than you do with...

270
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:29,423
your own men.

271
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:33,636
I called Colonel Lawrence here.
Now from you...

272
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:36,389
I want the names of all
prisoners who are informed...

273
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:38,474
on the subject of armaments
and ammunition.

274
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:40,476
Who are the experts here?

275
00:29:42,103 --> 00:29:44,063
I am not required under
International Law...

276
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:46,023
to furnish the enemy with
any information.

277
00:29:46,065 --> 00:29:49,860
This is not North Africa.
We are not Germans!

278
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:52,029
There is no Geneva Convention here.

279
00:29:52,196 --> 00:29:56,117
If you do not follow my orders,
I will have to replace you.

280
00:29:56,283 --> 00:30:00,121
Replace me?
What are you talking about?

281
00:30:00,454 --> 00:30:02,039
Replace me with whom?

282
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:08,504
Do you know what
he's talking about?

283
00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:10,005
No sir. I don't know.

284
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:14,802
You promised to improve
our food ration.

285
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:16,929
You eat the same as we eat.

286
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:20,683
Give me the names of your experts.

287
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:25,688
No, Captain Yonoi.
I will not.

288
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:45,166
Captain Yonoi.
Please try to understand.

289
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:48,544
Group Captain Hicksley
is an honourable man.

290
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:52,798
"They are all, all honourable men. "

291
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:57,595
As commanding officer, I prefer
another honourable man.

292
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:54,860
Lawrence, this armaments thing.

293
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:59,240
I think we can string it out
for quite sometime, don't you?

294
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:02,493
I mean, young Tojo will never
notice the difference.

295
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,459
They're not fools, you know,
sir, the Japanese.

296
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:14,588
They know how badly the war's
going for them.

297
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:16,757
A couple months, it could
all be over.

298
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:19,760
Then why not try and stay alive
for a couple of months?

299
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:21,595
Sir, I know these people...

300
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,933
I wish you'd be guided
by my knowledge.

301
00:32:26,016 --> 00:32:28,936
I know these people, too.
They're the enemy.

302
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:31,105
And you're a British soldier.

303
00:32:32,356 --> 00:32:37,027
You know they once
beat the Russians.

304
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:39,989
Really?
What school did you go to?

305
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:41,740
Winchester.

306
00:32:58,048 --> 00:33:00,050
Who's looking after Major Celliers?

307
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,220
- I am, sir.
- How's he coming along?

308
00:33:03,303 --> 00:33:06,557
He's a tough man.
Anyone else would have been dead.

309
00:33:06,682 --> 00:33:08,642
When will he be up and
about, do you think?

310
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:10,728
Christ, I had to give him
a sedative, so he'll sleep...

311
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:13,188
most of the time. I'd say a
couple of weeks.

312
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:16,525
- Good. Where's the big chief?
- I'll get him for you.

313
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:19,611
All right, you malingerers.
Now hear this!

314
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:23,157
Colonel Lawrence is going to
stay here for a few nights.

315
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:27,035
- He's one of those, mate!
- Want my boxing gloves?

316
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:19,379
- Where is he?
- Sleeping.

317
00:34:20,547 --> 00:34:22,549
Take me.

318
00:34:48,242 --> 00:34:51,328
Why was he captured?

319
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:54,665
He wasn't.
He surrendered.

320
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:06,426
Why does Capt. Yonoi want to
make him commanding officer?

321
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:11,265
- I don't know.
- Answer me Lawrence...

322
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:15,978
Because he's a born leader.

323
00:35:19,523 --> 00:35:22,442
Why are you still alive?

324
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:27,406
I'd admire you more if
you killed yourself.

325
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:30,325
A good officer like you!

326
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:35,747
How can you stand the shame?

327
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:42,421
We don't call it shame.

328
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:51,430
Being a prisoner is one of
the fortunes of war.

329
00:35:51,513 --> 00:35:55,308
We surely aren't happy
being prisoners.

330
00:35:56,518 --> 00:36:02,149
We want to escape.
We want to fight you.

331
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:06,486
That's just quibbling.

332
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:12,784
No! We want to win.
This camp isn't the end.

333
00:36:13,577 --> 00:36:17,998
We won't kill ourselves.
That's the coward's way out.

334
00:36:18,498 --> 00:36:21,793
You're just scared of dying!

335
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:24,671
Don't wake the patients.

336
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:30,844
When I was 12, I visited
the shrine in my village.

337
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:34,306
I offered my life to the Emperor.

338
00:36:34,556 --> 00:36:38,727
I have already died for my country.

339
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:45,400
Yes. But you're not dead are you?

340
00:36:57,412 --> 00:36:59,289
It's all right, Jack.
It's Lawrence.

341
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:01,416
It's all right. You're fine.
It's all right.

342
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:04,503
Sergeant Hara isn't
going to hurt you.

343
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:07,672
Sergeant Hara isn't
going to hurt anyone.

344
00:37:12,594 --> 00:37:17,390
What on earth possessed Yonoi
to save me do you think? - I don't know.

345
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:20,268
What did he say, Lawrence?

346
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:30,654
What a funny face!
Beautiful eyes, though.

347
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:18,994
Make him well.
Cure him quickly.

348
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,671
All right?

349
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:16,718
What's that bloody noise!
What's the matter with them?

350
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:19,763
They're trying to become
super human gods.

351
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:22,766
They live in the past,
these fellows.

352
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:25,685
God help them, Lawrence.

353
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,106
And that's our Captain Yonoi's
voice, isn't it?

354
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:32,275
He's been screaming
his head off...

355
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:34,319
ever since you got here.

356
00:39:34,486 --> 00:39:36,404
If he's got something
on his mind...

357
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:38,406
why doesn't he come out with it?

358
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,450
I rather think he is.

359
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:43,453
Perhaps we're both
on the same ladder.

360
00:39:51,836 --> 00:39:53,755
Are you okay?

361
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,301
It was a nightmare.

362
00:41:01,906 --> 00:41:07,870
Ueki is worried about these
training sessions...

363
00:41:07,954 --> 00:41:11,874
that they are too violent.

364
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:16,671
Sir, your shouts make
the prisoners uneasy.

365
00:41:16,963 --> 00:41:20,216
Lawrence has come to me.

366
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:22,844
- Lawrence is here?
- Outside.

367
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:33,896
Is it true that our shouts
disturb the prisoners?

368
00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:36,524
Yes, yes, sir. It is.

369
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:40,695
And you? Do you feel uneasy?

370
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:47,493
Well, I find the noise irritating,
but it doesn't make me uneasy.

371
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:51,205
However, some of the sick men...

372
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:58,212
- That sick officer, too?
- Major Celliers? Yes.

373
00:41:58,963 --> 00:42:02,508
I do not want the prisoners
to become upset.

374
00:42:04,052 --> 00:42:05,303
Thank you, Captain Yonoi.

375
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:16,606
How wonderful it
would have been...

376
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,359
if we could have
invited all of you...

377
00:42:19,525 --> 00:42:22,570
to a gathering under
our cherry trees.

378
00:42:23,362 --> 00:42:24,697
Yes.

379
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:30,912
My fondest memory of
Japan is the snow.

380
00:42:31,913 --> 00:42:33,873
The trees covered with snow.

381
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:40,922
- It was snowing on that day.
- What day?

382
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:47,261
Don't you know?
February 26, 1936.

383
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:50,264
Yes... yes.

384
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:56,104
I was in Tokyo that day.
You too?

385
00:42:56,354 --> 00:43:02,610
No. I had been sent off to
Manchuria 3 months before.

386
00:43:02,735 --> 00:43:05,947
I was not there
for the uprising.

387
00:43:07,156 --> 00:43:09,117
You regret that?

388
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:12,995
My comrades were executed.

389
00:43:13,162 --> 00:43:16,958
I was left to die after them.

390
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:24,423
I see. So you were one of the
shining young officers...

391
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:41,774
And bring that
sick officer Lawrence.

392
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:50,700
Attention.

393
00:43:51,784 --> 00:43:53,953
Salute.

394
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:06,591
Eyes right.

395
00:44:08,884 --> 00:44:11,637
Lawrence, where is
that sick officer?

396
00:44:12,138 --> 00:44:15,766
- The doctor stopped him.
- You stopped him, Lawrence.

397
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,727
He is very weak.

398
00:44:18,936 --> 00:44:22,732
Where is the victim?
Let him step forward.

399
00:44:28,988 --> 00:44:31,449
We're here on your orders.

400
00:44:31,616 --> 00:44:36,162
We're under no obligation to
watch this execution.

401
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:43,711
If you had any humanity left in
you, sir, you would let us leave.

402
00:44:44,086 --> 00:44:47,006
Any of you who can't watch it...

403
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:49,008
keep your eyes shut or turn round!

404
00:44:49,091 --> 00:44:52,720
But I will no permit you
to leave this site!

405
00:44:53,012 --> 00:44:55,431
Allied officers do not turn
their back on the enemy.

406
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:16,452
Ready...

407
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:14,135
Raise your head.

408
00:46:52,464 --> 00:46:55,801
Oh, my God, he's bitten his
tongue off, for Christ's sake.

409
00:46:56,802 --> 00:46:58,304
Roll him over.

410
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:01,640
Christ. He's swallowed a part
of his tongue.

411
00:47:14,028 --> 00:47:16,822
- Pay your respects.
- Come on, lads.

412
00:47:18,073 --> 00:47:21,827
- Not yet.
- We want to pay our respects!

413
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:25,915
- You Jap lover!
- Stop them.

414
00:47:26,081 --> 00:47:30,961
You have no respect for anything!
Not even your own men!

415
00:47:31,086 --> 00:47:34,006
You're wrong, Captain Yonoi!
By God, you're wrong.

416
00:47:34,173 --> 00:47:37,176
You are to say nothing
about today's execution...

417
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:39,178
or this soldier's death
until it is announced.

418
00:47:39,386 --> 00:47:44,350
If you're so bloody right,
you've got nothing to hide!

419
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:48,354
We must wait for the
official announcement.

420
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,898
This is the right way.
I am right.

421
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,525
Colonel Lawrence,
am I not right?

422
00:47:55,277 --> 00:47:59,198
No. No, Captain Yonoi.
You're wrong.

423
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:02,534
We're all wrong.

424
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:12,211
I order all prisoners,
each and everyone of you...

425
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:18,092
not to go out to the fields
today or tomorrow.

426
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:23,180
Instead, you shall stay inside
your barracks for 48 hours...

427
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,016
and undergo "gyo".

428
00:48:27,017 --> 00:48:32,815
You'll observe gyo for 48 hours.
There will be no eating

429
00:48:34,149 --> 00:48:35,776
or drinking. Is this clear?

430
00:48:42,116 --> 00:48:44,076
What the hell's gyo?

431
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,538
It's a Japanese cure for laziness.

432
00:48:47,746 --> 00:48:50,207
Laziness, Jesus Christ!

433
00:48:50,624 --> 00:48:52,751
Why don't you listen?

434
00:48:54,044 --> 00:48:56,255
He means spiritual laziness.
And he believes...

435
00:48:56,296 --> 00:48:58,257
that if he takes away the food
and the water, then he also...

436
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,384
takes away the nourishment
for the laziness!

437
00:49:00,509 --> 00:49:03,262
You don't believe that bullshit,
do you?

438
00:49:03,345 --> 00:49:04,471
I don't fucking know!

439
00:49:04,638 --> 00:49:07,766
Sir, I will tell you something
that may surprise you.

440
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,893
If we do it, he'll do it!

441
00:49:43,177 --> 00:49:45,262
- Peasant!
- Here.

442
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:48,265
- Mills!
- Here.

443
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:51,310
- Ibbertson
- I'm hungry.

444
00:49:52,352 --> 00:49:55,230
- Adams.
- Eggs and bacon, mate.

445
00:49:56,398 --> 00:49:59,610
- Baxter!
- Steak and kidney-pie.

446
00:50:01,403 --> 00:50:06,325
Put up with it for another
13 or 14 hours. You can do it!

447
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,120
How about giving us a wee whisky?

448
00:50:11,163 --> 00:50:13,790
What about a double whisky?

449
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:16,460
De Jong!

450
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:21,673
Next! Who's next?

451
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:23,133
He's dead.

452
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:30,849
He's not dead!
He'll be back in a few days!

453
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:33,018
De Jong has been killed!

454
00:50:34,394 --> 00:50:40,192
De Jong has been killed!
De Jong has been killed!

455
00:50:42,402 --> 00:50:43,612
Thank you.

456
00:50:44,404 --> 00:50:45,948
Next.

457
00:50:46,114 --> 00:50:48,033
- Craig!
- Here.

458
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:51,161
- Smith!
- Yes.

459
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:52,704
Celliers!

460
00:51:02,255 --> 00:51:05,133
- Where is Major Celliers?
- He said he'd be back soon.

461
00:51:05,342 --> 00:51:07,844
One man is missing.
Major Celliers.

462
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:10,597
Look, he'll be here in a moment.
Just mark us all here.

463
00:51:10,764 --> 00:51:14,017
I can't do that. I'll have to
report him missing.

464
00:51:14,101 --> 00:51:16,353
No, please.
Just a few minutes!

465
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,733
Celliers?

466
00:51:22,734 --> 00:51:24,027
That's right.

467
00:51:24,736 --> 00:51:27,030
What are those flowers for?

468
00:51:28,448 --> 00:51:29,574
Food.

469
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:31,243
Food?

470
00:51:34,246 --> 00:51:37,124
I wish they were white, but these
were all that I could find.

471
00:51:37,207 --> 00:51:39,167
In memory of De Jong.

472
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,672
It might be nice if you were to
say something, Lawrence.

473
00:51:56,143 --> 00:51:59,146
Our father who art in Heaven,
Hallowed by thy name

474
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:03,442
Thy Kingdom come,
Thy will be done

475
00:52:03,525 --> 00:52:06,778
Give us this day our daily bread

476
00:52:07,612 --> 00:52:13,785
And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive them that...

477
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:16,413
- Give me another.
- And lead us not into temp...

478
00:52:21,376 --> 00:52:24,963
What are you doing?
We must observe the gyo.

479
00:52:25,046 --> 00:52:26,798
What the hell are you doing, Major?

480
00:52:27,424 --> 00:52:31,761
I gave Major Celliers
permission, sir.

481
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:35,932
Ah, changed our tune, have we?
What happened to the gyo?

482
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:40,437
- What are all these flowers for?
- In memory of De Jong, sir.

483
00:52:40,604 --> 00:52:44,566
He didn't give me permission, sir.
And it was my idea.

484
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:46,276
Really?

485
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,571
Lawrence, over here.

486
00:52:57,662 --> 00:53:02,500
You knew of Yonoi's plan to
replace me as commander?

487
00:53:02,584 --> 00:53:04,085
Yes, sir, I did.

488
00:53:04,336 --> 00:53:06,421
May I ask why you
didn't tell me?

489
00:53:06,671 --> 00:53:09,007
It's still only a rumor, sir.

490
00:53:13,553 --> 00:53:15,472
You don't like me, do you?

491
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:17,807
Captain Yonoi doesn't like you.

492
00:53:18,683 --> 00:53:20,810
I don't know what to
make of you, Lawrence.

493
00:53:22,395 --> 00:53:26,858
You've either very clever, or
you're bloody stupid.

494
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:28,568
But I tell you one thing.

495
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:31,446
I will never give Yonoi any
information about officers...

496
00:53:31,738 --> 00:53:36,451
or armaments.
You understand that?

497
00:53:37,327 --> 00:53:40,455
And I will never resign as
commander of this camp.

498
00:53:40,538 --> 00:53:42,999
You can tell that to Yonoi.
Never!

499
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,383
Bloody hell!
It's an inspection!

500
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:38,513
Don't waste the food.
Keep eating it.

501
00:54:38,638 --> 00:54:40,640
I'll take the responsibility.
And keep singing.

502
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:45,311
Rock of Ages,
cleft for me

503
00:54:45,478 --> 00:54:49,649
Let me hide
Myself in Thee

504
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:53,862
Let the water
And the Blood

505
00:54:53,945 --> 00:54:55,488
Come on now...

506
00:54:55,655 --> 00:55:01,202
From Thy riven side which
Flow'd Be of sin the

507
00:55:01,578 --> 00:55:03,455
For God's sake get those bloody
flowers off De Jong's bed!

508
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:07,959
No, leave those on.

509
00:55:12,046 --> 00:55:16,968
I will inspect all of you to see.
You scum!

510
00:55:17,177 --> 00:55:18,970
You aren't eating?

511
00:55:26,352 --> 00:55:30,148
If you've got anything
hidden away in here...

512
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,943
You all have "Manju" cakes!

513
00:55:38,781 --> 00:55:42,702
Talk! Damn it!
Who brought them in here?

514
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:51,002
Flowers!

515
00:55:58,134 --> 00:56:00,094
Are you crazy?

516
00:56:02,138 --> 00:56:05,600
Well I've tried the "Manju".
And I've tried the flowers.

517
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:08,519
And I think the flowers
taste better.

518
00:56:18,112 --> 00:56:20,323
Stop resisting!

519
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,272
Stop it.

520
00:57:00,196 --> 00:57:01,155
Shut up.

521
00:57:02,824 --> 00:57:05,118
What was that singing?

522
00:57:05,243 --> 00:57:08,329
They're practicing for christmas.

523
00:57:08,454 --> 00:57:10,123
It's for a funeral!

524
00:57:25,221 --> 00:57:30,601
Who do you think you are?
Are you an evil spirit?

525
00:57:31,978 --> 00:57:34,564
Yes, and one of yours I hope.

526
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:47,076
To the cell!

527
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:04,635
He's not an evil spirit.
He's a human being!

528
00:58:05,845 --> 00:58:10,892
Get rid of your superstitions!

529
00:58:15,563 --> 00:58:18,274
We found this radio!

530
00:58:24,655 --> 00:58:30,286
You stayed here, so I'm sure we
can count on you to tell us.

531
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:34,832
My God!

532
00:58:40,671 --> 00:58:42,298
- Who's there?
- The key!

533
00:58:42,381 --> 00:58:44,967
I can't give it to you.

534
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:48,262
- It's Captain's orders.
- Isn't he coming?

535
00:58:48,346 --> 00:58:51,349
- Does he come here?
- Every night.

536
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:57,230
Give me the key.

537
00:58:59,148 --> 00:59:00,233
Take this!

538
01:01:36,263 --> 01:01:39,266
Lawrence, we're going walkies.

539
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:46,482
Listen, we're getting out
of here! On my shoulder.

540
01:01:46,524 --> 01:01:48,484
Jack, look, we can't...

541
01:01:48,651 --> 01:01:53,739
The tube line doesn't
come this far.

542
01:01:53,989 --> 01:01:58,369
Everything's all right. Yonoi
gave me a Persian rug.

543
01:01:59,161 --> 01:02:01,121
It's all right for you.

544
01:02:07,795 --> 01:02:11,131
I can't get my legs to work.

545
01:02:12,341 --> 01:02:15,844
Do you mind if I take the guard?
He's a lot lighter.

546
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:36,365
This is quite ridiculous.

547
01:02:41,328 --> 01:02:44,581
I presume you've come
for your carpet.

548
01:03:11,025 --> 01:03:15,988
Why don't you fight me? If you
defeat me, you will be free.

549
01:03:23,954 --> 01:03:25,831
I'll kill him.

550
01:03:33,172 --> 01:03:39,470
I think he's taken a bit of
a shine to you.

551
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:45,225
To the cells!

552
01:03:46,393 --> 01:03:49,313
Please forgive me, Captain.

553
01:03:49,772 --> 01:03:54,401
I want to apologize for my
behaviour with death.

554
01:03:57,071 --> 01:04:00,240
- Are you able?
- Yes.

555
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,035
Why try to kill him?

556
01:04:04,912 --> 01:04:09,416
That man is a devil! He will
destroy your spirit!

557
01:05:16,275 --> 01:05:20,821
How very straight you sit!
I'm very impressed with you!

558
01:05:22,197 --> 01:05:26,076
I'd sit even straighter if my
legs hadn't been wrecked.

559
01:05:32,416 --> 01:05:36,003
My batman. He committed
harakiri last night.

560
01:05:36,253 --> 01:05:39,506
The government doesn't pay a
death benefit in cases...

561
01:05:39,548 --> 01:05:41,049
of suicide.

562
01:05:41,258 --> 01:05:45,512
Sergeant Hara has advised me
to treat the death...

563
01:05:45,596 --> 01:05:47,514
as a death in action.

564
01:05:47,598 --> 01:05:50,726
This is my batman's
funeral ceremony.

565
01:05:50,767 --> 01:05:53,312
How very thoughtful of
Sergeant Hara.

566
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:58,066
In your case, Sergeant Hara's
thoughtfulness means that...

567
01:05:58,275 --> 01:06:03,238
your wife will receive a pension
from British Army.

568
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:07,284
You awful bastard!

569
01:06:12,706 --> 01:06:14,249
Sit up!

570
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:36,438
This morning I put my seal on
Hara's recommendation.

571
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:41,318
It has gone to Batavia. We'll
get their answer quite soon.

572
01:06:41,401 --> 01:06:43,320
It's only a formality.

573
01:06:43,403 --> 01:06:47,324
Once the papers arrive, we can
put you to death.

574
01:06:48,909 --> 01:06:51,328
Well that should please
Sergeant Hara.

575
01:06:51,411 --> 01:06:53,955
You brought the radio
into the camp.

576
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:56,333
You know that is not true.

577
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:58,251
Not true?

578
01:07:00,962 --> 01:07:03,632
If you didn't do it, who did?

579
01:07:04,424 --> 01:07:07,219
We must punish someone.

580
01:07:09,513 --> 01:07:10,847
But why?

581
01:07:13,183 --> 01:07:15,227
Would you rather punish
the wrong man...

582
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:18,188
than see the crime itself got
unsolved and unpunished?

583
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:19,856
Yes.

584
01:07:22,275 --> 01:07:27,197
You mean I'm to die because
you think if there's a crime...

585
01:07:28,406 --> 01:07:30,492
then it must be punished?

586
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:35,288
And it doesn't matter
who is punished?

587
01:07:42,879 --> 01:07:46,383
You're not by any chance a
Gilbert & Sullivan fan are you?

588
01:07:46,466 --> 01:07:47,592
What?

589
01:07:51,471 --> 01:07:54,432
You're not very funny really.

590
01:07:56,518 --> 01:07:58,228
I see.

591
01:08:01,231 --> 01:08:04,150
So I'm to die to preserve
your sense of order.

592
01:08:04,401 --> 01:08:08,154
Yes. You understand, Lawrence.

593
01:08:08,905 --> 01:08:11,324
You must die for me.

594
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:18,331
I understand.
But I won't die for you!

595
01:08:21,251 --> 01:08:24,713
Should I have lied about the
radio, Sergeant Hara?

596
01:08:26,423 --> 01:08:31,553
Should I have said I
brought it into the Camp?

597
01:08:32,137 --> 01:08:33,513
Sergeant Hara!

598
01:08:35,765 --> 01:08:36,850
Stop it!

599
01:09:04,336 --> 01:09:06,296
It's your gods.

600
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:11,384
It's your bloody awful
stinking gods.

601
01:09:12,302 --> 01:09:14,763
They made you what you are.

602
01:09:16,097 --> 01:09:19,976
May they rot in whatever filthy
hell they came from!

603
01:09:20,852 --> 01:09:25,106
Damn them!
Damn your fucking gods!

604
01:09:28,485 --> 01:09:30,445
To the cells!

605
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:34,741
Wait!

606
01:09:38,411 --> 01:09:42,457
What will happen to
Major Celliers?

607
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,459
That is none of your business.

608
01:09:46,419 --> 01:09:50,090
Oh, you wouldn't execute
Major Celliers...

609
01:09:50,256 --> 01:09:54,886
for a crime like bringing a
wireless into a ward.

610
01:09:55,178 --> 01:09:58,765
Your friend was a
disappointment to me.

611
01:09:59,557 --> 01:10:03,061
Do you want to see him
before you die?

612
01:10:38,263 --> 01:10:39,806
What happened in there?

613
01:10:41,474 --> 01:10:46,062
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

614
01:10:59,075 --> 01:11:01,161
Something's changed.

615
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,040
I read it all wrong.

616
01:11:08,585 --> 01:11:10,795
Do you think you've had it?

617
01:11:12,255 --> 01:11:17,218
What? What?

618
01:11:18,094 --> 01:11:20,221
Do you think you've had it?

619
01:11:23,433 --> 01:11:25,435
Bloody radio!

620
01:11:34,485 --> 01:11:37,030
Yonoi said something strange.

621
01:11:38,656 --> 01:11:42,744
He said: "I'm disappointed
in your friend. "

622
01:11:46,664 --> 01:11:48,750
What is wrong with
them, Lawrence?

623
01:11:52,545 --> 01:11:53,922
I don't know.

624
01:11:56,507 --> 01:11:59,177
They were a nation of
anxious people.

625
01:12:00,637 --> 01:12:03,890
And they could do
nothing individually.

626
01:12:05,808 --> 01:12:09,854
So they went mad, en masse.

627
01:12:15,026 --> 01:12:18,279
God I wish they'd
stop hitting me.

628
01:12:28,498 --> 01:12:33,294
I don't want to hate any
individual Japanese.

629
01:12:46,724 --> 01:12:47,683
John.

630
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,145
John Lawrence.

631
01:12:54,732 --> 01:12:56,609
Good night, John Lawrence.

632
01:13:05,034 --> 01:13:07,537
What's up John?

633
01:13:11,165 --> 01:13:13,334
I was dreaming.

634
01:13:15,503 --> 01:13:17,922
I was dreaming about this woman.

635
01:13:19,674 --> 01:13:23,177
Christ, sounds like
she cut it off.

636
01:13:30,601 --> 01:13:32,770
I only met her twice...

637
01:13:55,501 --> 01:13:57,378
I met her only twice.

638
01:13:58,588 --> 01:14:01,132
Just before the fall
of Singapore.

639
01:14:03,551 --> 01:14:06,429
The streets were just
packed with people.

640
01:14:07,388 --> 01:14:12,643
Everybody was trying to get out.
They'd all gone mad.

641
01:14:13,728 --> 01:14:18,191
The hotels were packed.
Everybody was screaming.

642
01:14:20,735 --> 01:14:22,653
And there was this woman,
who was different from...

643
01:14:24,071 --> 01:14:28,659
all the rest, really.

644
01:14:29,452 --> 01:14:31,787
She didn't seem to
be frightened.

645
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:36,459
I was frightened.

646
01:14:39,629 --> 01:14:44,759
We talked about the war
and she kept saying...

647
01:14:45,801 --> 01:14:50,765
"What's the truth?
I want to know the truth. "

648
01:14:52,808 --> 01:14:55,603
Bloody silly question, really.

649
01:14:59,941 --> 01:15:05,696
We arranged to have breakfast
together the next morning.

650
01:15:06,781 --> 01:15:09,951
And would you believe it?
I was whipped off.

651
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:16,958
The attack had started.
Japanese landed.

652
01:15:20,503 --> 01:15:23,714
Anyway I got back to the hotel
a few days later...

653
01:15:24,048 --> 01:15:26,801
and would you believe it?

654
01:15:28,511 --> 01:15:30,638
She was still there.

655
01:15:30,888 --> 01:15:36,769
She was standing in exactly
the same place...

656
01:15:37,269 --> 01:15:39,188
that I'd left her.

657
01:15:39,355 --> 01:15:43,943
It was as if she hadn't move
since I walked away.

658
01:15:46,153 --> 01:15:49,865
Like I'd run across the street
for a packet of cigarettes.

659
01:15:55,955 --> 01:15:58,999
I don't think I want to talk
about this anymore really.

660
01:16:34,577 --> 01:16:36,537
Jack, are you there?

661
01:16:38,914 --> 01:16:41,125
Yes, I suppose so.

662
01:16:42,751 --> 01:16:44,128
What's the matter?

663
01:16:46,005 --> 01:16:49,717
The past, again and again.

664
01:16:50,759 --> 01:16:53,804
You've got me at it now, John.

665
01:16:55,723 --> 01:16:59,101
Who is she? Your turn in
the confessional.

666
01:17:00,728 --> 01:17:05,691
I've not had many romantic
interludes of great importance.

667
01:17:06,692 --> 01:17:09,904
My experience lies in the
field of betrayal.

668
01:17:18,704 --> 01:17:22,833
Ride, ride through the day

669
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:28,881
Ride through the moonlight

670
01:17:29,256 --> 01:17:36,722
Ride, ride through the night

671
01:17:37,973 --> 01:17:47,942
For far in the distance
Burns the fire

672
01:17:48,275 --> 01:17:55,032
For someone who
Was waited long

673
01:18:01,455 --> 01:18:04,166
How do you find the time to
compose these songs?

674
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:06,043
While you're at school.

675
01:18:19,056 --> 01:18:24,895
Lead us Heavently Father,
Lead us

676
01:18:25,104 --> 01:18:29,608
O'er the world's
Tempestuous sea

677
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:35,739
Guard us, guide us,
Keep us, feed us

678
01:18:35,906 --> 01:18:40,828
For we have no help
But Thee

679
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:46,917
Yet possessing every blessing,
If our God our Father be

680
01:18:47,126 --> 01:18:50,713
Listen! They're a two
full notes off!

681
01:18:53,632 --> 01:19:00,556
Savior, breathe forgiveness
O'er us

682
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:04,685
All our weakness
Thou dost know

683
01:19:14,403 --> 01:19:16,739
- They're after me.
- But why?

684
01:19:16,822 --> 01:19:20,492
- I laughed at them.
- I laughed, too!

685
01:19:20,534 --> 01:19:23,245
They hate me!
They like you.

686
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:29,001
I won't let them touch you.
Go on home.

687
01:19:29,084 --> 01:19:31,920
Don't look back no matter what!
Understand?

688
01:19:33,046 --> 01:19:35,007
Do what I told you!

689
01:19:58,030 --> 01:19:59,198
Be brave.

690
01:20:02,034 --> 01:20:03,494
Hey, hunchback!

691
01:20:04,036 --> 01:20:05,996
Get out of the way!

692
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:08,081
Don't run!

693
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:11,043
All right! You asked for it!

694
01:20:46,536 --> 01:20:49,456
What an earth do you think
you're doing!

695
01:21:06,932 --> 01:21:08,475
Are you all right?

696
01:21:09,893 --> 01:21:13,021
You brought the pastor!
Why did you have to interfere?

697
01:21:13,105 --> 01:21:15,023
Why didn't you go home
like I said?

698
01:21:15,315 --> 01:21:18,944
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

699
01:21:42,592 --> 01:21:44,344
Stop crying.

700
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:49,433
You hate me, too!

701
01:22:32,225 --> 01:22:34,311
My brother was scared out of
his skin when the time came...

702
01:22:34,352 --> 01:22:36,354
for him to go to school.

703
01:22:36,396 --> 01:22:39,149
I was in the sixth form,
top of my class...

704
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,151
and head of my house.

705
01:22:41,234 --> 01:22:44,780
Even so my brother lived every
day in absolute terror...

706
01:22:44,863 --> 01:22:47,032
of being revealed...

707
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:57,125
Tomorrow's the initiation.
Any exemptions?

708
01:22:57,209 --> 01:23:00,462
One got a weak heart. But he's
got a doctor's certificate.

709
01:23:00,712 --> 01:23:05,133
I've got one who's blind as a bat.
He can't even pee straight.

710
01:23:05,926 --> 01:23:10,013
You've got a younger brother
in your house haven't you?

711
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:13,266
- What about him?
- Well, what about him?

712
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:18,104
- I was merely wondering if he was...
- He's perfectly all right.

713
01:23:18,355 --> 01:23:22,692
If there's any reason why you'd
want your brother excused...

714
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:28,490
It's awfully decent of you,
but there's no reason.

715
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:45,215
I knew my brother was
waiting for me.

716
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:49,052
But I couldn't conscience the
thought of the whole school...

717
01:23:49,094 --> 01:23:51,179
setting eyes on his back.
It would reflect on me...

718
01:23:51,388 --> 01:23:55,433
and anything related to me
was not of the best.

719
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,145
I asked the science master
to let me stay after class...

720
01:23:59,229 --> 01:24:01,147
to make preparations for the
experiments the next day.

721
01:24:25,297 --> 01:24:29,509
Why was he born so beautiful?

722
01:24:29,634 --> 01:24:33,471
Why was he born at all?

723
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:37,684
He's no bloody use to anyone

724
01:24:37,851 --> 01:24:41,229
He's no bloody use at all

725
01:24:41,312 --> 01:24:43,189
Come on chaps!

726
01:24:47,402 --> 01:24:51,197
- What can you do?
- I hear he can sing.

727
01:24:51,322 --> 01:24:55,035
Oh he's one of those, is he?

728
01:24:55,201 --> 01:24:59,205
Come on sing!

729
01:24:59,789 --> 01:25:04,127
Sing, Sing, Sing.
Sing. Sing. Sing.

730
01:25:04,294 --> 01:25:10,008
Ride, ride through the day

731
01:25:10,216 --> 01:25:17,932
Ride, ride through the night

732
01:25:18,308 --> 01:25:28,193
For far in the distance
Burns the fire

733
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:34,574
For someone who
Has waited along

734
01:25:52,342 --> 01:25:54,677
Jack, help me!

735
01:27:14,007 --> 01:27:16,050
So how did it go today?

736
01:27:17,427 --> 01:27:19,429
You mean you didn't see?

737
01:27:20,555 --> 01:27:23,516
No. I was in the science
laboratory all afternoon.

738
01:27:23,599 --> 01:27:28,229
I had to finish a job for
the science master.

739
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,606
I see.

740
01:27:33,318 --> 01:27:38,573
My brother never sang
another note... ever.

741
01:27:39,907 --> 01:27:43,036
He took over our father's
farm in due course.

742
01:27:43,494 --> 01:27:46,664
The last time I saw him was
at his wedding.

743
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:51,919
Over the years, I became,
you might say...

744
01:27:52,128 --> 01:27:56,090
a haunted person.

745
01:27:57,467 --> 01:28:01,846
I really wanted to see him again.
I never did.

746
01:28:03,431 --> 01:28:08,144
I was 32, eligible batchelor...

747
01:28:08,352 --> 01:28:14,358
a reasonably successful lawyer
and absolutely nothing.

748
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:21,908
When war broke out, God,
I embraced it.

749
01:28:22,241 --> 01:28:25,703
With some inexplicable sense
of relief and the kind...

750
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:32,335
of enthusiasm I hadn't shown for
anything for... I don't know.

751
01:28:33,127 --> 01:28:36,047
You should have joined the
Foreign Legion, Jack.

752
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:38,341
It would have been
an easier life.

753
01:28:38,633 --> 01:28:41,052
That's the last thing I want.

754
01:28:43,513 --> 01:28:47,892
- Here comes the milkman now.
- Two pints.

755
01:28:48,142 --> 01:28:51,395
Shouldn't we order an extra one.
It's Christmas remember?

756
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:55,066
Well, it was lovely chatting
but I really must fly.

757
01:28:55,149 --> 01:28:57,401
It's not you. They've como
for me.

758
01:29:05,368 --> 01:29:07,745
How is it John you're
always wrong?

759
01:29:18,923 --> 01:29:21,843
- The prisoners, sir.
- Come in.

760
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:50,454
So, Sergeant Hara,
you're human after all.

761
01:29:51,539 --> 01:29:52,498
What?

762
01:29:54,584 --> 01:29:59,547
So Sergeant Hara,
you're human after all.

763
01:30:03,175 --> 01:30:08,180
Lawrence-San!
You know Father Christmas?

764
01:30:09,557 --> 01:30:11,642
What's he saying to us?

765
01:30:14,645 --> 01:30:18,274
Yes, Hara-San.

766
01:30:19,609 --> 01:30:25,156
Father Christmas means Santa Claus.

767
01:30:27,617 --> 01:30:30,995
I'm Father Christmas tonight.

768
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:35,875
Tonight, I'm Father Christmas.

769
01:30:37,376 --> 01:30:40,087
He thinks he's Santa Claus.

770
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:44,550
Father. Father Christmas.

771
01:30:47,595 --> 01:30:49,889
Father Christmas!

772
01:31:06,614 --> 01:31:08,908
Go with him.

773
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:15,498
You're both free.
He's pissed as a newt.

774
01:31:22,671 --> 01:31:25,591
Merry Christmas.

775
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,390
Thank you.

776
01:31:47,655 --> 01:31:51,951
Merry Kurisumasu, Lawrence!
Merry Kurisumasu!

777
01:31:54,328 --> 01:31:55,454
Bonkers.

778
01:32:09,218 --> 01:32:11,554
I brought the squad, sir.

779
01:32:27,903 --> 01:32:30,197
All present, sir.

780
01:32:37,496 --> 01:32:39,623
Lawrence! Why are you here?

781
01:32:39,832 --> 01:32:43,878
- I released him last night.
- Why?

782
01:32:44,295 --> 01:32:49,758
Yesterday I questioned a
Chinese prisoner.

783
01:32:50,426 --> 01:32:56,640
He confessed he smuggled the
radio into the sick bay.

784
01:32:56,849 --> 01:33:00,644
I had him executed.

785
01:33:01,645 --> 01:33:05,566
I was wrong to blame Lawrence.

786
01:33:05,733 --> 01:33:07,610
Why not report it!

787
01:33:07,693 --> 01:33:12,698
- I also released Jack Celliers.
- Without my permission?

788
01:33:13,782 --> 01:33:17,745
Sir, I was a little drunk.

789
01:33:18,787 --> 01:33:24,668
I didn't think Lawrence or
Celliers would do us harm.

790
01:33:25,753 --> 01:33:30,174
I didn't think you wanted
them to be martyrs.

791
01:33:31,759 --> 01:33:34,887
I'll take the consequences.

792
01:33:38,724 --> 01:33:40,309
Whatever happened to your
idea to replace me...

793
01:33:41,226 --> 01:33:45,314
with Major Celliers?

794
01:33:45,397 --> 01:33:46,815
Shut up, sir.

795
01:33:49,735 --> 01:33:54,406
Where is your report on armament's
experts here in the camp?

796
01:33:54,615 --> 01:33:58,994
- There are none here, sir.
- Not one among 600 men?

797
01:33:59,078 --> 01:34:02,664
Do you think you can get away
with such an obvious lie?

798
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:07,419
I'm told it is the Japanese
way to lie, sir.

799
01:34:07,753 --> 01:34:13,008
Very well! All prisioners
on parade in five minutes!

800
01:34:13,092 --> 01:34:14,343
Dismissed!

801
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:23,811
All of them, I said.
Everyone!

802
01:34:38,784 --> 01:34:44,456
I'm sending prisoners to
Haruka to build an airstrip.

803
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:47,376
You'll take charge of them.
You leave in three days.

804
01:35:02,516 --> 01:35:05,936
In the meantime you will be
confined to your room.

805
01:35:06,687 --> 01:35:08,147
Without sake.

806
01:36:02,743 --> 01:36:04,494
What are they up to now?

807
01:36:05,037 --> 01:36:10,834
I don't think it's anything.
Fairly routine stuff this.

808
01:36:35,275 --> 01:36:38,278
- Listen, John.
- What?

809
01:36:40,405 --> 01:36:41,823
I wish I could sing.

810
01:37:25,325 --> 01:37:27,077
It is beautiful.

811
01:37:32,749 --> 01:37:35,168
My orders were explicit!

812
01:37:35,252 --> 01:37:38,463
I said that all prisoners
were to assemble!

813
01:37:39,339 --> 01:37:41,591
You are not all here!

814
01:37:41,967 --> 01:37:44,094
We are all here, sir.

815
01:37:45,846 --> 01:37:48,098
You! Come here!

816
01:37:56,815 --> 01:37:58,900
You lied to me again!

817
01:37:59,151 --> 01:38:04,448
I said all the prisoners!
Where are the men from the hospital?

818
01:38:04,614 --> 01:38:07,576
- They cannot possibly be moved!
- It's out of the question!

819
01:38:07,659 --> 01:38:09,536
All prisoners will
assemble immediately!

820
01:38:09,661 --> 01:38:12,038
Get them! Now!
Get them!

821
01:39:54,057 --> 01:39:56,393
You're faking.

822
01:39:58,061 --> 01:40:00,980
You are not sick!

823
01:40:02,065 --> 01:40:07,654
Your spirits are sick!

824
01:40:16,579 --> 01:40:21,042
Bastard! He's going to die!

825
01:40:56,202 --> 01:40:57,662
Captain Yanoi.

826
01:41:02,208 --> 01:41:03,543
He's dead!

827
01:41:07,046 --> 01:41:09,257
You! Get over here!

828
01:41:25,190 --> 01:41:26,316
You...

829
01:41:28,193 --> 01:41:31,487
you and you...

830
01:41:32,030 --> 01:41:35,074
Come here! Now!
Come here!

831
01:41:49,714 --> 01:41:52,800
As a representative of the
British Air Force how...

832
01:41:52,967 --> 01:41:58,097
many experts in weapons and
guns do you have in your group?

833
01:41:58,765 --> 01:42:00,225
None, sir!

834
01:42:04,854 --> 01:42:06,272
Death!

835
01:43:04,664 --> 01:43:07,458
You! Go back!
Go back!

836
01:43:08,251 --> 01:43:12,422
Go back! Go back!

837
01:43:50,251 --> 01:43:51,377
Stop it!

838
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:32,960
I am not as sentimental
as Captain Yonoi.

839
01:44:34,086 --> 01:44:37,715
Things will be different now.

840
01:45:31,185 --> 01:45:32,270
Detail...

841
01:45:37,733 --> 01:45:38,859
Attention!

842
01:45:39,986 --> 01:45:43,280
Platoon... attention!

843
01:45:43,739 --> 01:45:49,286
Detail will advance by the left.
Quick march.

844
01:46:25,072 --> 01:46:26,991
Understand them do you,
Lawrence?

845
01:46:28,242 --> 01:46:32,329
If I were you,
I would commit harakiri.

846
01:49:36,555 --> 01:49:39,475
I'm pleased to see you.
Really Jack.

847
01:49:39,683 --> 01:49:41,477
I wanted to come.

848
01:49:42,644 --> 01:49:44,605
Don't apologize.

849
01:49:47,816 --> 01:49:51,195
But I've wronged you, badly.

850
01:49:51,570 --> 01:49:53,530
Help me water these things.

851
01:50:00,621 --> 01:50:03,540
Look, I need to talk to you.

852
01:50:04,625 --> 01:50:06,710
Remember this one?

853
01:50:07,503 --> 01:50:09,046
You know I don't.

854
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:12,883
It flowers once every
five years. That's all.

855
01:50:15,385 --> 01:50:19,389
I'll be back before
it flowers again.

856
01:50:19,765 --> 01:50:21,683
Cross my heart.

857
01:50:24,603 --> 01:50:26,772
Let's go back to the house.

858
01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:35,906
Ride, ride through the day

859
01:50:35,989 --> 01:50:41,161
Ride through the moonlight

860
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:49,086
Ride, ride through the night

861
01:50:52,756 --> 01:51:01,598
For far in the distance
Burns the fire

862
01:51:02,683 --> 01:51:08,605
For someone who
Has waited long

863
01:54:42,819 --> 01:54:46,573
I knew you would come,
Mr. Lawrence.

864
01:54:48,825 --> 01:54:55,415
- You've learned English.
- Yes very little. Please?

865
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:04,466
I very nearly didn't
get your message.

866
01:55:09,387 --> 01:55:11,348
It's tomorrow morning.

867
01:55:28,531 --> 01:55:31,409
Well if it was up to me.

868
01:55:31,534 --> 01:55:35,789
I'd release you today, send
you back to your family.

869
01:55:39,751 --> 01:55:45,048
Thank you.
I'm ready to die.

870
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:52,680
I don't understand.
My crimes were...

871
01:55:52,764 --> 01:55:55,725
no different from any
other soldier's.

872
01:56:14,285 --> 01:56:17,539
You are the victim of men who
think that they are right...

873
01:56:19,666 --> 01:56:24,254
just as one day, you
and Captain Yonoi...

874
01:56:32,929 --> 01:56:38,268
And the truth is, of course,
that nobody is right.

875
01:56:48,862 --> 01:56:51,114
Do you remember Jack Celliers?

876
01:56:52,657 --> 01:56:56,578
Strange.
I dreamed of him last night.

877
01:56:57,996 --> 01:56:59,622
Did you really?

878
01:57:09,090 --> 01:57:13,887
Captain Yonoi gave me a lock
of Jack Celliers hair...

879
01:57:14,762 --> 01:57:20,643
and he asked me to take it to
his village in Japan.

880
01:57:23,855 --> 01:57:25,148
It's sad.

881
01:57:27,984 --> 01:57:30,403
That he was executed
after the war.

882
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:44,375
It was as if Celliers,
by his death...

883
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:48,212
sowed a seed in Yonoi...

884
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:52,550
that we might all share
by its growth.

885
01:57:58,056 --> 01:58:01,059
Do you remember that Christmas?

886
01:58:03,144 --> 01:58:05,063
Yes.

887
01:58:12,028 --> 01:58:14,906
It was a good Christmas,
wasn't it?

888
01:58:16,824 --> 01:58:22,413
It was a wonderful Christmas.
You were drunk.

889
01:58:24,999 --> 01:58:28,920
May I go on and on being drunk?

890
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,840
Sake is wonderful.

891
01:58:33,049 --> 01:58:37,929
Thank you. Father Christmas.
Thank you.

892
01:59:11,838 --> 01:59:16,968
There are times when victory
is very hard to take.

893
01:59:22,723 --> 01:59:24,142
Good bye. Hara-san.

894
01:59:28,062 --> 01:59:30,064
God bless you.

895
01:59:38,781 --> 01:59:40,283
Merry Christmas!

896
01:59:42,076 --> 01:59:45,371
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Lawrence!

897
01:59:46,305 --> 02:00:46,466

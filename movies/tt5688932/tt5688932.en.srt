2
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,480
So, it says here that you were manager

3
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,360
of the Rusty Scupper Restaurant
for five years.

4
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,600
Hmm? Then, a bank teller

5
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,243
at Bank of Oakland between 2014 to 2016?

6
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,683
Oh! And you were employee of the month.

7
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,520
What's that trophy in the bag there?

8
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,680
Oh! Oakland High Moot Court Champion.

9
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm a salesman at heart.

10
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,720
That is intriguing.

11
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,088
Mainly... because I was the branch manager

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,600
at the Bank of Oakland between 2014 and 2016.

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,400
And you, Mr. Green,
you never fucking worked there.

14
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,400
And the number that you gave to
The Rusty Scupper Restaurant?

15
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,403
Is that your friend Salvador's number?

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,649
The same Salvador who applied for this job?

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,840
I didn't know he applied here, too.

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,480
Might have been helpful
if his outgoing message

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,200
didn't say, "It's Sal, bitches."

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,560
This trophy and that plaque,
did you steal 'em?

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,240
No, uh, I... made them.

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,720
Well, I had them... made.

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,361
Listen, I just really, really need a job.

24
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,800
Okay, Cassius Green, listen up, okay?

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,689
This is telemarketing.

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,280
We're not mappin' the fuckin'
human genome here.

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,840
I don't care if you have experience for this.

28
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,400
I'll hire damn near anyone.

29
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,800
You know what this bootleg trophy tells me?

30
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,000
Tells me the only thing I need to know.

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,447
You have initiative and you can read.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,000
You will call as many contacts
as you can during your shift,

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,440
you will read the script that we give you,

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,640
and you will show up tomorrow happy.

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Hmm?

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,880
Thank you. Uh, thank you
so much, Mr. Anderson.

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,645
Ah, one more thing, Cassius... "Stuss."

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,440
"Stuss"?

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,920
S.T.T.S.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,600
Stick to the script.

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,809
Stick to the script.
Stick to the script. You got it.

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,720
Thank you so much.

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,241
Troit!

44
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,521
Troit!

45
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,967
Troit!

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,484
You ever think about dying?

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,488
Yeah, I'm alive. Sometimes.

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,480
No, I don't mean like right now,

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,720
in a freak accident or something.

50
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,248
I mean... when we're old, like 90.

51
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,920
I think about it all the time.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Like, what will I have done that matters?

53
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,680
I just want to make sure that when I die

54
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,800
I'll be surrounded by people who love me

55
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,405
and who I love back.

56
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,845
But what about when they die?

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,087
What do you mean?

58
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,520
I mean, like at some point we're gonna die.

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,560
Our kids are gonna die.
Our kids' kids are gonna die.

60
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,920
And at some point,
no one on Earth will have existed.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,480
And at... at some point...

62
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,880
the sun will explode
and everyone will have died.

63
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,804
And no one will know what I'm doing, and
what I'm doing right now won't even matter.

64
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,040
Baby, baby it will always matter, okay?

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,440
Because it matters now.
This moment, these moments.

66
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,280
When I kiss you...
it's not for posterity's sake.

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,480
Yeah, but... okay, you got your calling.

68
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,640
Your art means something, right?

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,360
But I'm just out here surviving;

70
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,040
spinning around on the endless circle.

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,362
- Ah, you missed your cue.
- That's disgusting.

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,000
I said, "When I kiss you,
it's not for posterity's sake."

73
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,571
- Yeah, but...
- Mmm!

74
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,160
Oh, God!

75
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,921
- Get a room!
- I got a room, muthafucka!

76
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,770
I thought you said you fixed that!

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,883
My landlord was supposed to fix it.

78
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,840
I gotta move.

79
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,840
- Mmm!
- I like that.

80
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,449
I have to go to work anyway.

81
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
- Don't you start work today?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,202
They said they hire anybody
if you're looking for a second job.

83
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,640
You could try part-time.

84
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,240
<i>Everyone is talking
about the WorryFree solution!</i>

85
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,240
<i>WorryFree is a revolutionary new business and
lifestyle model taking the world by storm!</i>

86
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,800
Baby, how much are they paying you?

87
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,320
<i>When you sign a WorryFree contract,</i>

90

93
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,161
Cash, baby, what are they paying you?

94
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,120
Uh, I think it's just commission.

95
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,201
Hey, baby...

96
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,163
you ever think about this WorryFree shit?

97
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,960
Are you crazy?

98
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,565
What, working on commission?

99
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,400
Nice earrings.

100
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,240
Hey, Cash!

101
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,200
I got overdue house notes, dude.

102
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,771
How much longer I got to wait for my money?

103
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,400
Look, Serge, I just got a new job
and I'll have some money for you soon.

104
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,320
Damn it, you four months late now.

105
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,562
It's like "soon" is the only
fuckin' word I hear from you.

106
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
Okay, I'm four months late, but...

107
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,960
Check this out. Damn.

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,960
God made this land for all of us,

109
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,720
and greedy people like you want to hog it
to yourself and your family

110
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,920
and charge all the rest of us
for the right to live.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,840
- Me and my family?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,800
Cassius, I'm your fucking uncle.

113
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,720
The bank might take my fucking house.

114
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Four fucking months.

115
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,560
I gave you that car you're driving.

116
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,600
- That's a damn bucket.
- Oh, yeah?

117
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,445
Give it back then! No?

118
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,200
That's what I thought.

119
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,045
I need my money in two weeks, asshole.

120
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,640
Hey.

121
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,767
Forty on two.

122
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,161
<i># Oh, yeah #</i>

Millions of dollars went into these walls

140
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,040
just to... make sure that thousands of calls

141
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,720
can go out and in at the same time

142
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,325
without jamming the lines.

143
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
Log in here. Grab a seat.

144
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,601
Come on.

145
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,006
You studied the script?

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,840
- Yeah.
- Look, clock in,

147
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,400
don't be lazy,

148
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,760
and I won't have to be an asshole.

149
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,280
Make a sale, this light goes on.

150
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,080
You do real good,

151
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,320
eventually you might even be able
to be a Power Caller.

152
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,280
- A Power Caller?
- Where the callers are ballers.

153
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,523
Where they make the real money.

154
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,529
They even have their own elevator.

155
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,885
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,331
Stick to the script.

157
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,481
What the fuck?

158
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,960
- Hello.
- Hey, Mr. Davidson.

159
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,724
Cassius Green here. Sorry to bo...

160
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,080
Another one!

161
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,800
Hello?

162
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
Uh, this is Cassius Green.
Sorry to bother you.

163
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,080
I just wanted to mention something else about

164
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,000
an encyc... <i>Insight Encyclopedia.</i>

165
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,000
Hello?

166
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
- Hi, Mrs. Costello.
- Yes.

167
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,844
This is Cassius Green.

168
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,560
I know that you've enjoyed our, uh,
series on birdwatching,

169
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,840
so I wanted to call and... and help you out.

170
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,288
I'm sorry, young man,
we don't have any money.

171
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,523
My husband's in the hospital.

172
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,720
He's 73. He's got stage 4 cancer.

173
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,889
Um...

174
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,441
it's...

175
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,880
Oh, it's interesting that
you say that, Mrs. Costello,

176
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,800
because book number five
in the <i>Insight</i> series

177
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,520
is all about wellness,
how to stay healthy... on your own

178
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
without even going to the doctor, so... so...

179
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,841
Damn it.

180
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,800
Really? You gonna stuff all those
French fries in your mouth?

181
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,241
I feel incompetent
and like an asshole doing this job.

182
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,726
I don't feel any different.

183
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,680
Hey.

184
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,560
That's that the dude from that show.

185
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,640
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh, shit!

186
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
That's fucking cool. I hate that show.

187
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,240
But I never noticed that, uh, room.

188
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,640
What... what is that?

189
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,200
The VIP room.

190
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,480
What the hell is a place like this
doing with a VIP room?

191
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,000
I used to be in there all the time.

192
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,520
Well, what qualifies a person to be VIP?

193
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,080
Well, you need the password.

194
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,920
And this week it's "upscale elegance."

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,200
Actually, every week it's "upscale elegance."

196
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,362
- I'm goin'.
- Where the fuck you going?

197
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,600
Yeah!

198
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Fuck!

199
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,120
Ah!

200
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,847
That's some baller shit.

201
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,880
Hey! Mr., uh, D. Imits, Cassius Green here.

202
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,600
Sorry to bother you. I just...

203
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,761
Hey, youngblood.

204
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
- What up?
- Lemme give you a tip.

205
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,811
Use your white voice.

206
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,643
- My white voice?
- Yeah.

207
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,160
Man, I ain't got no white voice.

208
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,360
Oh, come on, you know
what I mean, youngblood.

209
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
You have a white voice in there,
you can use it.

210
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,000
It's like when you get
pulled over by the police.

211
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,960
Oh, no. I just use my regular voice
when that happens.

212
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,080
I just say, "Back the fuck up off the car
and don't nobody get hurt!"

213
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,080
All right, man, I'm just trying
to give you some game.

214
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,360
You wanna make some money here?

215
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,443
Then read the script with a white voice.

216
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,480
Well, people say I talk
with a white voice anyway,

217
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920
so why it ain't helping me out?

218
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,080
Well, you don't talk white enough.

219
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,040
I'm not talkin' bout Will Smith white.

220
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,800
That ain't white, that's just proper.

221
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,723
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm talking about the real deal.

222
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay, so like...

223
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,280
"Hello, Mr. Everet. Cassius Green here.

224
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,931
- Sorry to bother you"...
- Nah, man. Look, you got it wrong.

225
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,920
I'm not talking about sounding all nasal.

226
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,640
It's, like, sounding like
you don't have a care.

227
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,560
Got your bills paid.
You're happy about your future.

228
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,760
You about ready to jump
in your Ferrari out there

229
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,400
after you get off this call.

230
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,200
Put some real breath in there.

231
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,365
Breezy like...
"I don't really need this money."

232
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,280
You've never been fired.

233
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,249
Only laid off.

234
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
It's not really a white voice.

235
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,520
It's what they wish they sounded like.

236
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,560
So, it's like what they think
they're supposed to sound like.

237
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,920
Like this, youngblood.

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,360
Hey! Mr. Kramer!

239
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,720
This is Langston from RegalView.

240
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,087
I didn't catch you at the wrong time, did I?

241
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,320
If you're ever gonna be a Power Caller,

242
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,120
you gotta know when to
bag 'em and when to tag 'em.

243
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Yeah?

244
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,120
Hey. Um, what's baggin' and what's taggin'?

245
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,680
Bagging is when you drop the call.

246
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,640
Like a dead body into a bag,

247
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,840
you drop that shit
'cause it crossed the line.

248
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,440
Tagging is when you claim that money.

249
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,360
It's a sale. Cha-ching!

250
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,880
Like when they put the tag on the body
at the morgue to identify it.

251
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,400
That's mine.

252
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,880
Maybe you already bagged
that dead body, right?

253
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,120
And you're just about
to walk away, skip town,

254
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,884
lay low for a little while.

255
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,400
But instead, you drag that heavy fucker

256
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,440
on out into the alley and... then you tag it!

257
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,400
Okay. Uh, I... I just...

258
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,200
I feel like these metaphors have not
been cleared for this pep rally.

259
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,880
- Ah, okay. Diana?
- Oh! Yes.

260
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,920
Uh... hi. I'm new,

261
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,560
so forgive me for not knowing
everyone's name yet.

262
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,120
My name is Diana...

263
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,128
Dee-bo-sher-ree.

264
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,880
- That looks like "debauchery."
- Well, it's not.

265
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,560
Uh, I am your new Team Leader!

266
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,971
And I know you're looking at me going,

267
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,760
"Is she a manager? I'm scared." Okay.

268
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,320
"She's going to treat me like a system
of motorized appendages!"

269
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,440
No, that stops here, that stops right now.

270
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,240
You are not employees to me.

271
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,360
You are Team Members! We're a family now.
You know what that means?

272
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,091
It means I lean on you, you lean on me.
There's a synergy.

273
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
And you can feel that energy.
I know that you can.

274
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,360
People are starting to get
emotional, and I love that.

275
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,044
Does that mean we get paid more?

276
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,329
"No." Okay, but what is capital? Right?

277
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,680
I would argue that social currency
now is more important,

278
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,120
and don't take it from me,
take it from the news.

279
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,480
Take it from media, all kinds of media:
digital, paper, otherwise.

280
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,400
Media is changing, so is capital.

281
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,720
Get with it. I don't want to scare you,
but it's a new world.

282
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,240
Okay, Team Members. Let's, uh...

283
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,480
thank you very much,
and let's all get back to work.

284
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,160
Remember! Hit your contacts! Up the ante!

285
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,480
Work the grid! And...

286
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,080
- Stick to the script.
- That's right.

287
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,920
Any one of you can turn Power Caller

288
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,162
and be rollin' in dough!

289
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,444
Oh, excuse me.

290
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,003
Ah. Okay.

291
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,527
Nothing in this office is free, man,
you gotta put money in there.

292
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,081
Oh, re... really?

293
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,000
It's okay, you're not missing out.
It tastes like shit.

294
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,844
Fuck. I thought I could get lucky, asshole.

295
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,725
I was just giving you shit, man.
I'm... I'm Squeeze.

296
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,120
I've seen you around for a couple weeks.

297
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,850
It was a good question in there.

298
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,691
Cassius. People call me Cash.

299
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,250
It was a really good question in there, man.

300
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,520
- What, about us getting paid?
- Yeah.

301
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,480
I mean, I just think it's kind of silly

302
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,200
that we have to be all excited.

303
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,760
- I know, right?
- It's bullshit.

304
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,600
Exactly. I mean, you just cut
straight to the chase, man.

305
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,410
That's awesome.

306
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,000
A player gotta mob up with us
for some scrill and bennies.

307
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,650
Well, what the fuck does that mean?

308
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Uh, there's a bunch of us

309
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,600
that are organizing to get us paid more.

310
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,160
Get some benefits.

311
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,164
We could really use your energy
to jump things off.

312
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah, look, I gotta get back to work, man.

313
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,640
Hey, man, look, I'm sorry
I got you like this,

314
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,040
but obviously we can't talk here.

315
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,400
So, grab a drink later. It's on me.

316
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,400
Hey, lady, how much?

317
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,960
- Okay.
- So, we good?

318
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,531
- Yeah.
- Alright.

319
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,804
- Hey.
- What up?

320
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,800
- Who are you?
- That's Squeeze.

321
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,000
- Squeeze.
- He works with us at RegalView.

322
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,280
Squeeze, Detroit.

323
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,680
- Detroit? That's cool.
- Yeah.

324
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,763
My parents wanted me to have
an American name.

325
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
Nice!

326
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,400
And Detroit is a brilliant visual
and performance artist...

327
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,960
No, my art is not twirling signs.

328
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,800
...who's about to open her first show.

329
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,600
Okay, "Mr. Embarrassing Intro Guy."

330
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,840
Squeeze, in high school, Cash was...

331
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,560
Shit!

332
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,560
Stuck... brake.

333
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,600
Why do you always talk about
what I did in high school?

334
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,800
I mean, like, look at our
high school football team.

335
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,200
Literally. Look at 'em.

336
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,920
All they do is work at the
home furniture store

337
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,840
and play football all day.

338
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,000
It's, like, they're stuck or something.

339
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,163
Man, what the hell you talkin' bout?
I mean, they're friends.

340
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,809
Baby, can you please not talk
about the sun exploding tonight?

341
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,921
Okay.

342
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,160
Yeah, but you know, I... I just...
at the end of the day

343
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,760
I just don't want to be
stuck in their position.

344
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,365
Ah, shit.

345
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,680
D, wiper duty, please.

346
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,240
Come on, man. I never get wiper duty.

347
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,800
You can wipe my ass, Sal.

348
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,320
Oh, really? With what? My tongue?

349
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,880
Well, shit, it might make your breath
smell a little bit better.

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,720
in the sauce with the cheese in it first,

381
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,320
- that's some white shit.
- That's some bullshit man.

382
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,840
You don't get to decide
what's black and what's white.

383
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,480
Well, that-that...
but that's how black folks do it, man.

384
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,320
- No, nigga, I'm black.
- We talked about that, man.

385
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,200
You kind of black, you Lionel-Richie black.

386
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,000
Look, I... I make my noodles,

387
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,240
then I put the sauce on, then... look it,

388
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,920
then I put a little, uh, Parmesan...

389
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,320
it doesn't even fucking matter, alright,

390
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,880
'cause pasta is from Italy.

391
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Italians ain't white!

392
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,531
- Yes, they are, bro.
- Yes, they are!

393
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,240
Since the fuck when?

394
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,600
Since the last 60 years, man.

395
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,840
Spaghetti is Chinese.

396
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,960
Speaking of white, I'm gonna make a toast.

397

- Come on.
- A'ight.

398
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,487
Okay.

399
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,920
To my esteemed RegalView associates

400
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,560
whom I revere with great fervor...

401
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,920
What?

402
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,925
...and to my alluring and phenomenally
talented fiancée...

403
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,360
I'd like to dedicate this imbibing

404
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,280

405
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,160
Here's to becoming a Power Caller!

406
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,040
Cassius, how'd you do that?

407
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,600
Old man at the jobby-job.

408
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,800
It's called the white voice.

409
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,720
I guess I'm... a natural at it.

410
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,960
That was all some puppet-master voodoo shit!

411
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,560
Dude, you sounded overdubbed.

412
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,211
Man, your white voice, man,
it's fucking scary.

413
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,840
Yeah, I've never seen that shit before.

414
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,400
But I have heard about that Power Caller
shit that you're talking about.

415
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,440
That's a scam.

416
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,931
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

417
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,560
"If you work hard enough as a fry cook,

418
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,720
maybe you can become a manager!"

419
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,320
Or... or "If you twirl that sign really well,

420
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,000
then maybe you can twirl a larger sign
on a more glamorous corner."

421
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,920
No, I already have the best corner,

422
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,920
and the biggest sign,
and the best word. "Off."

423
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,570
It is the anchor to the slogan.

424
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,600
- So...
- So, what's the point then?

425
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,000
What you think, I'm just supposed
to work, eat, fuck, sleep?

426
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,163
No, I'm... I'm not saying that.
I'm saying what we need...

427
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,400
We need a union at RegalView.

428
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,080
That way, we all get paid.

429
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,720
Okay. Okay. Well said, broham.

430
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,370
I'm down.

431
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,640
- Hey, Cassius.
- Hey, Serge.

432
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,680
Uh, look, I get paid Friday,
so I'll have half your money by then.

433
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,240
Even if you had all the money,

434
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,240
your little four month's rent
wouldn't help me.

435
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,760
I owe too much.

436
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,480
If I don't come up with a boatload of money

437
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,085
by next month... which I won't...

438
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,880
the bank is taking my shit.

439
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,485
You should find a new place.

440
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,880
Damn.

441
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,327
It's making my diabetes act up.

442
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,560
So, what you gonna do?

443
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,960
I've been talkin' to those WorryFree people.

444
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,240
They sent me a brochure.
It don't sound that bad.

445
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,520
Three hots and a cot, like we used to say.

446
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,080
- Oh, hell no, Serge. Come on.
- No, don't... don't do that.

447
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,651
Look, we'll figure something out.

448
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,680
Yes, I'm so sorry to bother you.

449
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,640
Yeah, well, let me tell you.
I got a special for you.

450
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,280
Look, you bring a chick
home to your apartment.

451
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,400
It's clean. It's stylish.

452
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,040
Of course, it is. She's already seen that

453
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,520

454
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,280

455
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,320

461

I'm going to have you playing basketball
in Pelican Bay!

477
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,320
Yeah!

478
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,920
Baby, yes!

479
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,200
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

480
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Woo! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

481
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,480
Yes!

482
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,240
I...I should probably get back to work, man.

483
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,880
You're stoked, man!

484
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,240
You're doin' so fucking good
with the voice thing.

485
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,560
But hit more contacts per hour.

486
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,040
Mm-hmm.

487
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,169
Oh. They're talkin' about you, bro.

488
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,040
You're on your way.

489
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,920
Pah!

490
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,367
To where, heaven?

491
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,440
Almost.

492
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,729
PC, baby. Power Caller.

493
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,365
Oh, uh...

494
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,520
- Did you hear what he just said?
- Yeah, yeah, I heard him, man.

495
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,680
He told me the exact same shit
three months ago.

496
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,364
Nice earrings.

497
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,529
Thanks. Made 'em myself.

498
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,800
<i># Copulation #</i>

499
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,000
<i># An equation... #</i>

500
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,400
What kind of world is it

501
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,528
when this is the most popular show
in America?

502
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,760
They say 150 million people
watch this every night.

503
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,046
Mmm.

504
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,920
I, personally, love seeing

505
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,160
a muthafucka get beat down and humiliated.

506
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,488
Makes... makes me feel warm inside.

507
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,120
I got the muthafucking T-shirt.

508
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,804
- Oh!
- Check this.

509
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,120
Oh!

510
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,400
- I'm gonna go dance, man.
- Alright. Yeah, motherfucka.

511
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,362
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm! No.

512
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,641
Give me the good stuff.

513
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,007
Give me the good stuff.

514
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,081
Yeah.

515
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,323
That's what I'm talking about.

516
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,720
So, why you ain't dancing' man?

517
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,080
Motherfucker, I'm too old for that shit.

518
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,240
Man look, what happened to just
doing the muthafucking dog,

519
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,280
Umf-umf-umf-bow-wow.

520
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,440
You know I'm freakin,
you know what I'm saying?

521
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,400
Shit, now you got to dislocate
your muthafucking shoulder.

522
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,722
Damn, what the fuck
I look like doin that shit?

523
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,960
You, uh...

524
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,566
Hey. Power Callers, right?

525
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,800
They make a shit ton of money, man.

526
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,920
I'm talking about, like, Benz,

527
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,209
and expensive house payment type of money.

528
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,040
How the fuck is that even possible?

529
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,680
If you selling the bullshit
we selling, it's impossible.

530
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,640
But they not selling the bullshit we selling.

531
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,360
So, I guess comparing to what we doing

532
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,680
to what they're doing
is like apples to oranges.

533
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,889
More like apples and the Holocaust.

534
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,040
Alright. Bye.

535
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,920
Don't look into the light.

536
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,320
Fuckin' asshole.

537
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,880
- What up bro?
- What's up man?

538
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,720
- Good man.
- Aw, that hurt.

539
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,211
It's all good. I've been telling

540
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,720
everybody how you've been
kicking all types of ass at work.

541
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,280
Yea. I mean it's crazy. I'm finally...

542
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,760
feel like I'm good at something.

543
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,160
I'm feeling myself.

544
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,320
- Word.
- I'm a fucking monster at this.

545
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,200
Man. That's awesome, man.

546
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,480
Fucking dope man. That's awesome.

547
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,164
Yeah... whoa!

548
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,880
- Hey, Sugar Foot. Hey.
- Hey, Lovely.

549
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,160
- Can I get that?
- Who invited you?

550
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,800
Who asked you?

551
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,520
I was hoping you'd pop up earlier.

552
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,000
I thought you were coming by.

553
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,481
Oh, to your gallery?
I thought you said don't come.

554
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,760
Your friends were helping you out.

555
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,280
Baby, that's what I said.
But don't listen to what I say.

556
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,560
Listen to what I want.

557
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,240
- I'm confused.
- Yeah, I know you are.

558
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,160
But are you gonna pick me up on Friday?

559
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,163
- That's what I want.
- Is cash green?

560
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,691
Yeah. Cash is green.

561
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,243
- Can I get a light?
- No.

562
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,440
Those are nice earrings.

563
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,126
Wait, baby. I didn't know
you changed your earrings.

564
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,364
Detroit, I didn't know you made
earrings of your ex-boyfriends.

565
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,120
Alright, everybody.

566
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,440
This is a pretty amazing turnout.

567
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,640
I hope you guys all know
that we're in this together.

568
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,440
That this is all of us, ride or die.

569
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,440
You know what today is?

570
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,160
Today is the warning shot.

571
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,924
Telling them that we stand united.

572
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,840
If we get this right today,

573
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,160
not only will it be our floor

574
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,880
but it will be every other floor
in RegalView and beyond.

575
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,880
A twenty-minute work stoppage
during prime calling time.

576
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,040
I'll give the call. Sal, what's the call?

577
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,080
Fuck you, pay me.

578
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,240
The other... other one.

579
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,240
Phones down.

580
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,200
Okay?

581
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,880
We hang up the phones. Put down our headsets.

582
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,883
Now, they're gonna single some of us out.

583
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,520
- Threaten our jobs.
- Fuck that.

584
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,120
- Yes, fuck that.
- Fuck that.

585
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,400
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck.

586
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,640
We ride for anyone they try to fire.

587
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,280
We fight

588
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,400
because we make the profits
and they don't share.

589
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,000
If we're gonna give them our day,

590
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,640
we need to have enough
to cover our basic necessities.

591
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,688
- Human decency.
- Yeah.

592
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,768
Is anyone not down?

593
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,600
Speak now.

594
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,364
Nah, fuck that, Squeeze! We're ready!

595
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,401
Hmm?

596
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,960
Yeah. Uh, one for all. All for one.

597
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,247
Yeah! I brought all types of weapons.

598
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,320
Alright, folks. Let's meet back
here at 3:00 PM. Okay?

599
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,120
- Don't. It's not that serious.
- Okay, alright cool.

600
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,770
It's like serious, but it's not that...

601
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,847
But I'm ready though.

602
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,640
Thanks, Mr. Goldberg.

603
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,320
As always, we'll be getting
that out to you right away.

604
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,800
By the way...

605
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,122
RegalView management...

606
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,488
you are hereby warned.

607
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,530
We will not be overlooked.

608
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,923
Fucking God...

609
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,520
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

610
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,603
Phones down!

611
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,882
Fuck you! Fuck you!

612
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,881
And fuck you!

613
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,884
Fuck you, RegalView!

614
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,600
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

615
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,280
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

616
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,200
Fuck you, RegalView!

617
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,880
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

618
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,720
Fuck you, RegalView!

619
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,280
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

620
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,920
Fuck you, RegalView!

621
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,520
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

622
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,360
Fuck you, RegalView!

623
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,800
Fuck you, RegalView!

624
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,883
##

625
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,880
Oh, man!

626
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,570
Out, out, out, out, out, out, out.

627
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,160
Alright, hey, look,

628
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,120
I know you're gonna threaten to fire me.

629
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,680
And go ahead whatever. I don't care anymore

630
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,160
cause we're gonna take this fuckin place...

631
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,760
Pack up your shit and get out.

632
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,120
Well, fuck you and fuck you and fuck you!

633
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,480
- What? No...
- Fuck you!

634
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,240
- Fuck you!
- No, no, no, no, no, no Mr. Green.

635
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,480
You're starting to sound
a little paranoid here.

636
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,760
We're the bearers of good news.

637
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,967
Great news.

638
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,923
Great mothafuckin' news.

639
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,120
Great motherfucking news.

640
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,720
Power Caller.

641
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,920
- What the fuck...
- Yeah, we just got the call.

642
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,684
They think you're A-1 material.

643
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,040
You're going upstairs my <i>compadre.</i>

644
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,080
Yes. You are getting a promotion.

645
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,360
9:00 AM tomorrow morning.

646
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,800
- Do you have a suit?
- Of course he does.

647
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,160
Powerful, young, strong,
intelligent Power Caller.

648
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,200
- But, but they, um...
- Oh, God.

649
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,920
They're gonna do what they're gonna do.

650
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,720
You're not going against their actions.

651
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,280
All their issues are down here. Not up there.

652
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,920
Two very different kinds of telemarketing.

653
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,527
But, but, oh, okay, um...

654
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,480
This is your moment. Don't waste it.

655
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,927
Woo woo! Woo woo! Woo woo!

656
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,321
Okay.

657
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,680
Maybe you're right.

658
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,120
The big money.

659
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,640
The top fucking tier of telemarketing.

660
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,328
Making history with legends like Hal Jameson.

661
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,931
Bad ass.

662
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,688
Oh, it's a really good batch,
so I hope you like France.

663
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,400
You should have some.

664
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,200
- Should I just drink it right now?
- Yes!

665
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,720
Oh, yes!

666
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
- Because we didn't have any cups.
- Power Caller.

667
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,203
- Yeah!
- Yes!

668
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,400
Power Caller, baby.

669
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,880
- Power Caller, man!
- Power Caller!

670
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,200
Power Caller. Power Caller.

671
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,521
##

672
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,086
Wow, you really are ready, aren't you?

673
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,407
Hey, Ms. D. Yeah.

674
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,205
Wow, oh, okay, well let's do
this, mu-tha-fuck-ah.

675
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,051
I've always wanted to say that.

676
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,520
Okay.

677
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,080
I would be remiss if I didn't
bring up your pink shirt.

678
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,360
I think it's extraordinary and sexy.

679
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,920
You know, 35% of men who wear pink

680
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,120
are more likely to start a franchise.

681
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,840
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

682
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,840
- Oh.
- Wow. Damn.

683
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,680
- This is crazy.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

684
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,364
So clumsy.

685
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,840
Almost done...

686
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,285
this job's crazy right?

687
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,570
Do you need help or something?

688
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,161
Okay.

689
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,082
It's very secure. It's very...

690
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,600
<i>Welcome, Power Caller.</i>

691
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,360
<i>Today is your day to dominate the world.</i>

692
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,800
<i>You are RegalView's elite brigade.</i>

693
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,520
<i>Take your place alongside
legends like Hal Jameson.</i>

694
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,762
<i>You call the shots.</i>

695
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,320
What...?

696
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,480
<i>You are in your sexual prime.</i>

697
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,847
<i>The top of the reproductive pile.</i>

698
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
Alright, does it do that every time...

699
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,960
Welcome to
the Power Calling Suite, Mr. Green.

700
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
White Voice at all times here.

701
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,965
Yes, I almost forgot.

702
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,051
Good luck.

703
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,880
Nice suit, by the way.

704
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,680
You've been selected, Mr. Green,

705
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,003
because you have the potential
to be a great telemarketer.

706
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,360
The potential.

707
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,240
Do you know what we sell up here?

708
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,800
- Oh, I heard it's a...
- Ah, we sell power.

709
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,600
Firepower. Manpower.

710
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,880
When U.S. weapons manufacturers
sell arms to other countries

711
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,280
who do you think, Mr. Green, makes
that call at the precisely perfect time?

712
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,567
Which is, of course, dinner. We do.

713
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,680
Before a drone drops a bomb

714
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,200
on an apartment building in Pakistan

715
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,040
who drops the bomb ass sales pitch

716
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,326
you may ask, Cassius?

717
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,800
We do.

718
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,480
Okay, so you said firepower, manpower?

719
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,320
WorryFree is our biggest client.

720
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,640
We help thousands of companies
utilize WorryFree workers

721
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,451
to improve their efficiency.

722
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,280
So, wait, are you telling me
you sell slave labor

723
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,720
to companies over the phone?

724
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,645
Hot damnit. You are a sharp one.

725
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,408
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

726
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,210
Dave, stop him.

727
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,641
Shit!

728
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,080
Left Eye, bitches!

729
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,640
WorryFree has resuscitated America.

730
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,480
Workers live in space efficient dwellings

731
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,767
in the same facilities where
production occurs.

732
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,920
They make anything and they make everything.

733
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,004
Lifetime contracts so no wages needed.

734
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,800
They make automobiles for what
it used to cost to make bicycles.

735
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,640
Okay, but see I don't know if I can...

736
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,520
Sugar on top, white voice.

737
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,160
Yeah, but what I'm saying is I don't know

738
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,680
if I'm gonna be able to s... sell...

739
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,525
Here's the starting salary.

740
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,881
Hmm?

741
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,280
Well, man, I'm gonna have
to get me some new suits.

742
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,120
You'll be working here until late.

743
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,960
We need you in the mix right away.

744
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,240
Hey baby, what's your sign?

745
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,924
I haven't heard that one before.

746
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,120
Yo, that was crazy yesterday.

747
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,080
That was like that scene in Norma Rae.

748
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,760
You know, the one when
she's like on the table.

749
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,001
Yeah, yeah.

750
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,771
Yeah, RegalView is scared shitless.
We'll win.

751
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,846
Can I check that out?

752
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,441
Yeah.

753
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,685
Oh, okay.

754
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,804
Okay. Bravo.

755
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,280
Where'd you learn how to do that?

756
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,441
Down in L.A.

757
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,720
We organized the first sign
twirlers union there.

758
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,720
Oh, okay.

759
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,760
Is that what you do?

760
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,680
You just go from place to place
stirring up trouble?

761
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,969
Trouble's already there.
I just help folks fix it.

762
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,560
Yeah, that's what I do with
my art too, you know.

763
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,080
Expose the bullshit.

764
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,600
- It's not exactly the same thing.
- It's pretty much the same.

765
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,520
I haven't seen your stuff so I can't...

766
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,523
I'm not gonna show you my stuff.

767
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,003
So how does it work with, uh...

768
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,880
with you and Cassius?

769
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,529
You know, you sound like a radical.

770
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,761
He's... I don't know.

771
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,811
He's what?

772
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,720
He's real.

773
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,920
He's not that fake-ass bougie gallery world.

774
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,082
So, that's how it works.

775
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,287
Well, you're rubbing him off right. So...

776
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,091
He helped with the work stoppage. So...

777
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,248
Your fire is rubbing off on him.

778
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,367
I like it.

779
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,560
I'm going.

780
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,120
You look like you're done here
if you need a ride.

781
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,727
Nah, Cash is on the way. But thank you.

782
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,845
Nice work.

783
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,440
Hey girl. We gotta go!

784
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,560
Thank you.

785
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,520
You okay?

786
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,640
Yeah.

787
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,480
- Did you get into an accident?
- No.

788
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,560
How about robbed or
something else crazy like that.

789
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,840
So, I don't think you flaked and
left me on a corner for an hour.

790
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,360
Yeah, I know. Look baby
I was gonna talk to you about it earlier

791
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,560
but I didn't know if it would be
a for sure thing or not.

792
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,840
But, as of today I'm a Power Caller.

793
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,082
Does that mean you can pay me back my $80?

794
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,360
Hell, yes, baby, of course I can.

795
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,523
Stop Cassius. Stop, it's freaky.

796
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,085
What do they sell?

797
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,560
Am I finally gonna be able to see your show?

798
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,400
Baby, this is beautiful.

799
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,040
And big.

800
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,451
Africa.

801
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,880
Oh, really, is that what this is?

802
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,680
Yeah, I mean they're big
because they're Africa.

803
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,120
So, I added the sculptures from last year.

804
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,760
Oh, okay. Well, if nobody shows up

805
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,490
at least it'll look full.

806
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,360
Can I... can I ask a question?

807
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,841
Why did you choose Africa?

808
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,400
I wanted to talk about a life
shaped by exploitation.

809
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,400
About fighting for a say in our own lives.

810
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,760
About how beauty, love, and laughter

811
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,000
thrive and flourish under almost
any circumstances...

812
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,286
Right.

813
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,520
How Capitalism basically started

814
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,080
by stealing labor from Africans

815
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,240
and about how you're nodding

816
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,640
like you're listening but you're not.

817
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,080
Oh, no sorry, baby. I was receiving that.

818
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,320
I was just had a long day and...

819
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,845
- it's work.
- It's okay.

820
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,520
You really want to hit this?

821
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,727
Yes.

822
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,000
Ah... yes, okay. I'm listening now.

823
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,280
Capitalism in Africa is booming.

824
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,120
Shh. I'm done talking.

825
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,680
I just want to marinate in this.

826
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,286
This is major for me, Cash.

827
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,680
What I want to do is I want to sit here,

828
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,600
hit this weed

829
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,683
and just be here.

830
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,520
Alright, guys. That felt good
the other day, right?

831
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,960
- Yes.
- Yes. Good, man.

832
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,080
Like I've known y'all
my whole life, you know.

833
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,000
Don't forget that. Okay?

834
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,083
Remember each other's faces.

835
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,160
Cassius? What's up man? Where you been?

836
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,640
What's up with the suit?

837
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,320
I got promoted.

838
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,080
What does that mean? Are you a manager now?

839
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,606
That means I'm a Power Caller now.

840
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,440
- About to be paid.
- We're all trying to get fucking paid.

841
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,400
- Yeah.
- But we're gonna do it as a team.

842
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,447
Are you on the team?

843
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah, I guess I'm still on your little team

844
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,800
but I'm playing from the bench.

845
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,520
The bench where you sit
and get your bills paid.

846
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,720
You know my uncle is about to lose his house.

847
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
Cash, I'm sorry about your uncle, man,

848
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,160
but that don't mean sell out.

849
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,129
I'm not selling y'all out.

850
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,640
My success has nothing to do
with you, alright.

851
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,320
You just keep doing whatever it is

852
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,440
that you're fucking doing
and I'll root for you.

853
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
From the sidelines.

854
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,887
And try not to laugh at that
stupid ass smirk on your face.

855
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,240
We don't need this.

856
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,000
- Are you doing alright?
- Yeah, I'm doing good.

857
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,480
- How you doing?
- Fantastic.

858
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,480
- Fantastic?
- I hope you have a good day.

859
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,880
I hope you have a better week.

860
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,280
I hope your month is full of successful days.

861
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,760
And a lot of great ventures.
I hope you just come up, brother.

862
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,440
I hope your whole fucking year
is spectacular.

863
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,240
- Oh, you hope my year is spectacular?
- Yeah.

864
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,800
You got something you want to say to me?

865
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,689
You got something you want to say?

866
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,760
- You smell great.
- You smell great. What is that?

867
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,440
Burberry. What you got on?

868
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,400
- I forgot. It's just deodorant.
- Smells expensive. Okay.

869
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,680
- Yeah. Good.
- We smelling good.

870
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,360
Some smelling good brothers out here.

871
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,120
You're an awesome man and I appreciate you.

872
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,320
- I hope you find yourself.
- Yeah, we should go out. Get drinks.

873
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,440
- You want to get drinks?
- Yeah!

874
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,080
- How many drinks?
- Two. Three.

875
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,400
- Three? Five?
- Four! Five!

876
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,760
- Six? Eight?
- Seven! Nine!

877
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,040
- Ten? On me?
- All of them!

878
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,240
It's on me, no, it's on me now!

879
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,600
- It's on you?
- Yeah, it's on me now.

880
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,840
- Alright. Alright!
- Yeah, it's on me!

881
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,490
- It's on you now.
-Now!

882
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,881
Walk!

883
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,520
<i>Greetings, Cassius Green.</i>

884
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,040
<i>I hope you did not masturbate today.</i>

885

887
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,000

888
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,240
<i>"Hold my penis while I piss on your
underestimated expectations."</i>

889
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,200
<i>Mr. Green, I am a computer</i>

890
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,728
<i>but I wish I had hands to
caress your muscular brain.</i>

891
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,640
Cassius Green, you've been
assigned a WorryFree campaign.

892
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,760
Brush up on that Chapter Six stuff.

893
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,649
Excuse me.

894
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,960
And give them that radiant voice of yours

895
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,840
in the next half hour.

896
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,120
2:00 PM.

897
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,760
Almost breakfast time in Japan.

898
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,128
Oh, okay. Ah, doodily doodily doodily doo.

899
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,880
- <i>Moshi moshi.</i>
- Mr. Son.

900
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,000
Cassius Green of WorryFree calling.
Sorry to bother you.

901
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,447
I'm calling about who
is assembling your phone.

902
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,449
Now I know they're being made in China.

903
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,720
I'm a big fan of yours.

904
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,680
I've been following you
since you were with Takashi.

905
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,680
I cheered literally when
I found out you acquired Tanrio,

906
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,560
which is why I'm calling you
and not Phonarolla.

907
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,641
Mm-hmm.

908
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,480
Our team of dedicated workers

909
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,200
will make twice as many phones
at half the cost.

910
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,240
You'll double up your market share

911
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,480
over these bastards.

912
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,400
Power Callers, our very own Cassius Green

913
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,280
just made our client, WorryFree,

914
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,880
upwards of ten million dollars

915
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,680
in one call on his first day, none the less.

916
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,570
- Oh, it's not that much.
- Indeed one for the history books.

917
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,091
Cheers!

918
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,840
Excuse me for a second.

919
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,480
What can I do for you, chum?

920
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,720
Yes, I have a question.

921
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,040
I've just achieved a sort of
miraculous financial endeavor.

922
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,120
I'm also in a financial bind.

923
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,280
I'm gonna need a cash advance.

924
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,361
Hmm.

925
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,600

00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,760
<i>Fuck RegalView! Fuck RegalView!</i>

959
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,360
<i>Fuck RegalView!</i>

960
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,960
<i>Fuck RegalView! Fuck RegalView!</i>

961
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,640
<i>And fuck chlamydia, too.</i>

962
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,960
<i>Although strikers have kept
most replacement workers</i>

963
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,480
<i>from breaking the strike</i>

964
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,520

965
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,160
<i>RegalView's elite Power Callers

966
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,810
<i>For more on the RegalView strike,</i>

967
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,480
<i>let's go to the studio.</i>

968
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,847
<i>This is Ken Bagget. Chanel 3 news.</i>

969
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,080
Hey baby. Good morning.

970
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,960
No. Please, no.

971
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,200
Stop with that stupid voice, Cassius.

972
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,606
Didn't even realize I was doing it.

973
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,484
That's a problem, you know.

974
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,641
Sorry.

975
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,365
How long you been up?

976
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,481
I'm not up.

977
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,640
But I saw your TV debut.

978
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,290
Oh, shit.

979
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,603
- Cash, baby...
- Can we not. Please.

980
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,280
Look, I quit when the strike jumped off

981
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,840
because being with you
made it awkward for me. But...

982
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,800
Cassius!

983
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,000
You abandoned your friends.

984
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,520
Baby, look, I thought they'd
do a couple of stoppages and...

985
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,160
It's one thing to take the promotion,

986
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,120
but now you're a full out scab.

987
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,203
Come on, baby,
the Power Callers ain't on strike!

988
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,080
No, but they should be.

989
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,200
I'm so tired of talking to you about this.

990
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,560
You are crossing the picket line.

991
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,800
I can't ride with you.

992
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,560
Oh, you can't ride with me now!

993
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,160
But you was riding with me
all around Oakland.

994
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,800
Alright, fine. Well, no more.

995
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,320
Baby, what are you asking me to do?

996
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,280
Are you asking me to quit
the fattest job I ever had?

997
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,880
But Cassius, it's not fat!

998
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,327
It is morally emaciated.

999
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,240
You sell fucking slave labor, Cassius!

1000
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,000
What the fuck isn't slave labor?

1001
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,280
Oh, my God! Side-stepping.

1002
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,840
You side-step more
than the fucking Temptations.

1003
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,720
You know what, fuck you, man!

1004
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,840
Fuck you, alright!

1005
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,160
Fuck you 'cause I'm doing something

1006
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,321
that I'm really fucking good at.

1007
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,920
I'm really good at it and I'm important.

1008
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,160
I'm making shit happen.

1009
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,520
And you don't appreciate the shit

1010
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,720
cause you already fucking had it.

1011
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,560
And you're talking to me about slave labor?

1012
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,440
What is Squeeze and them
gonna do about slave labor?

1013
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,840
What does Squeeze have to do with this?

1014
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,967
They ain't gonna do shit.

1015
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,440
And you ain't gonna do shit neither

1016
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,080
by selling fucking art to rich people.

1017
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,321
Fuck it.

1018
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,730
Gimme the damn covers!

1019
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,200
- What you doing?
- Taking them.

1020
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,560
- I'm cold.
- I'm not playing Cassius.

1021
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,440
- You're being greedy.
- Don't play with me, Cassius.

1022
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,808
You don't even need all those covers.
It's not necessary.

1023
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,440
The whole reason I went to work for RegalView

1024
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,488
was to make myself more interesting to you.

1025
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,931
Cassius, the old you
was way more interesting.

1026
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,600
If you go to work today at RegalView

1027
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,966
crossing the picket line...

1028
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,644
we're done.

1029
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,448
Elbows and assholes, people! Let's go!

1030
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,160
Chisels or dynamite, Cassius. You pick.

1031
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,120
Yeah, agreed. I just have to follow up

1032
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,565
on this lead I've been working on.

1033
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,840
This motherfucker right here...

1034
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,200
is on fire!

1035
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,600
Let's give it up for the boy wonder!

1036
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,680
Huzzah!

1037
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,680
Yeah, yeah! Some for the homeys.

1038
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,120
And some for me!

1039
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,440
Bag them, tag them, rag them!

1040
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,040
I trained her. I trained her.

1041
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,200
- We hunted mammoths!
- Yeah!

1042
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,921
Douse him. Douse our winner with champagne.

1043
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,801
##

1044
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,560
Scabs won't pass!

1045
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,320
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

1046
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,080
Scabs won't pass!

1047
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,731
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

1048
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,881
Move!

1049
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,761
I said get back!

1050
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,840
Have a cola and smile, bitch!

1051
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,680
Thank you very much, Miss Welcrott.

1052
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,880
I'll talk to you soon. Mm-hmm.

1053
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,166
Okay, bye.

1054
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,160
You, my friend,

1055
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:27,280
you are the best decision
I've made in quite a long time.

1056
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,760
I have to pat myself on the ass for that.

1057
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,520
Thank you, Mister.

1058
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,600
Feels good to be appreciated.

1059
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,684
Don't call me Mr. , Cassius.

1060
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,200
Call me.

1061
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,200
Million-dollar question for you, Cassius.

1062
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,720
Do you like to party?

1063
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,120
I like parties.

1064
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,600
What are you doing tonight?

1065
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,160
Oh, I got this thing.

1066
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,160
Well my girlfriend, ex-girlfriend...

1067
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,321
Fudge all that.

1068
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,760
Hmm!

1069
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,840
Steve Lift is throwing his yearly party.

1070
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,360
Wants to see our new star there.

1071
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,880
Wants to talk to you, Cassius.

1072
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,724
I have been waiting years for this invite.

1073
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,040
Even Jay and Bey can't get this invite.

1074
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,000
Hell yeah. I just got to do this other thing.

1075
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,600
You go to your other thing.

1076
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,251
And I'll be there waiting. Pick you up.

1077
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,763
This is the kind of party
that could change your life.

1078
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,520
Beauty, love, and laughter,

1079
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,920
must be stimulated to thrive and flourish
under almost any circumstances...

1080
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,560
I realize you were
asking about specific... that one.

1081
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,405
Yes, that's interesting.

1082
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,847
You know what,
will you please excuse me just one minute?

1083
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,480
- Hey.
- Hey.

1084
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,840
I wouldn't miss this for the world, you know.

1085
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,520
It's beautiful.

1086
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,560
- You're beautiful.
- Cash...

1087
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,920
I love you too...

1088
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,560
but I can't hang with what I see in you now.

1089
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,240
What happened to your head?

1090
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,320
Oh, um...

1091
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,840
It's nothing. I was just shaving...

1092
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,520
Alright, I have to go get ready
for my performance.

1093
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,440
You should really stay and see it, okay?

1094
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,320
Okay, but I can only stay
for a little while, baby,

1095
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,640
cause there's this party
I got to get back to. It's important.

1096
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,280
A slave auctioneers party?

1097
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,040
- Hey.
- Yo, what's up?

1098
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,200
Thank you for coming.

1099
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,480
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

1100
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,360
You always know just what to say, huh?

1101
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,280
I literally just said that.

1102
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,680
I hope you stay.

1103
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,320
Yo, is the reason why
you don't call me no more

1104
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,400
is cause you sell out or
cause you're just a star?

1105
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,960
What are you talking about?

1106
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,724
Eleven million views, man!

1107
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,120
What the fuck?

1108
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,123
You're like the Ariana Grande
of disloyal niggas.

1109
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,600
<i>Have a cola and smile, bitch!</i>

1110
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,520
You could really help us out right now.

1111
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,480
We got them by the balls,
but they're holding out.

1112
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,520
We got the info on how much
this is costing them.

1113
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,240
You flipping sides could turn the tide.

1114
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,721
Don't be the leaf that floats down the river.

1115
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,524
Be the stone that splits the stream.

1116
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,240
Is that Tupac?

1117
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,600
Welcome, friends! Gather around,

1118
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,364
form a semi-circle.

1119
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,560
Tonight, we will have a
transformative experience.

1120
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,320
In those containers,

1121
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,680
there are broken cell phones,
used bullet casings,

1122
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,160
and water balloons filled with sheep's blood.

1123
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,891
Cellphones can only work
with the mineral Coltan,

1124
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,600
which is found in Africa's Congo.

1125
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,960
The profit involved in this
has created hardship and wars.

1126
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,840
I will stand here.

1127
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,400
If you feel so moved,

1128
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,080
you may throw the items
in the containers at me.

1129
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,760
While I'm standing here,

1130
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,360
I will be reciting excerpts

1131
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:17,680
from the timeless
Motown-produced movie entitled

1132
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,160
"The Last Dragon".

1133
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,880
I'll recite those lines
Angela says to Eddie Arcadian

1134
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,963
as she leaves him.

1135
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,287
Let's begin.

1136
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,520
"And in the end, Eddie, you know what?

1137
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,200
"You're nothing but a misguided
midget asshole

1138
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,600
"with dreams of ruling the world.

1139
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,840
"Yeah, and also from Kew Gardens.

1140
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:53,080
And also getting by on my tits."

1141
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,161
Bravo!

1142
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,520
"And in the end, Eddie, you know what?

1143
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,400
"You're nothing
but a misguided midget asshole

1144
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,520
"with dreams of ruling the world.

1145
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,125
"And also from Kew Gardens.

1146
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,608
And also getting by on my tits."

1147
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:22,080
"And in the end, Eddie, you know what?

1148
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,640
"You're nothing but a mis...

1149
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,520
"misguided midget asshole

1150
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,920
"with dreams of ruling the world.

1151
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
"Yeah, also from Kew Gardens.

1152
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,320
And also getting by on my tits."

1153
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,640
Hey, hey, hey! Stop!

1154
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,080
What the fuck is this?

1155
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,840
Why would you subject yourself to this?

1156
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,160
It's a part of the show, Cassius.

1157
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,208
You of all people should understand, right?

1158
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,480
- Stick to the script.
- No.

1159
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:52,131
Don't you have a party to get to, Cash?

1160
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,241
Go!

1161
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,244
Go, Cash.

1162
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,289
Let's begin again.

1163
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,642
"And in the end, Eddie..."

1164
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,520
Well, I guess you're all wondering

1165
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,727
why I've called this meeting!

1166
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,680
Hey. Hey.

1167
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,360
Fucking sexy chocolate motherfucker!

1168
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,880
- Oh, yes!
- Cool guy.

1169
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,160
- You're coming with me.
- You're a cool guy.

1170
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,880
I know you're loving the new digs.

1171
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,725
Or even better, I'm digging the new loves.

1172
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,400
Stick around because...

1173
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,640
I think a lot of these bitches

1174
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,040
are gonna be getting naked later.

1175
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,600
You know, I mean,
your parties are the stuff of folklore.

1176
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,640
You got to meet the man of the hour though.

1177
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,120
Hey, Cassius Green.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1178
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,120
An honor even, sir.

1179
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,240
It's okay, he's friendly. He's friendly.

1180
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,720
Oh, yeah, how you doing man? You alright?

1181
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,040
I'm really well, thank you.

1182
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,360
Thank you for inviting us, Mr. Lift.
It's amazing.

1183
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,720
Just don't call me "Mister."

1184
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,120
Oh, uh... Steve.

1185
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:25,725
I never said "Steve."

1186
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,681
Sir.

1187
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,320
- I'm fucking kidding with you, man.
- Ow! Ow!

1188
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,960
You can call me whatever you want,

1189
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,610
you keep closing those deals.

1190
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,600
You must be like a fucking genius.

1191
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,960
I'd love to pick your brain

1192
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,840
because we need people like you at WorryFree.

1193
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,651
People who can comprehend
the big picture, you know?

1194
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,920
It's people like you that are
gonna save this nation.

1195
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,160
I mean look don't get me wrong;

1196
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,840
we still need the workers to do the work.

1197
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,040
Per se.

1198
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,680
But we also need people like you.

1199
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,046
People that can be trusted.

1200
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,520
People that can analyze
the challenge and adapt.

1201
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,603
Like a cunning racoon.

1202
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,480
Like a snake.

1203
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,005
Or like a tardigrade!

1204
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,201
Thanks...

1205
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,568
Go, I'll lock up.

1206
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,726
Great performance tonight, D!

1207
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,840
I told you, you didn't have to do that.

1208
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,002
No, it's my pleasure. It was good.

1209
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,484
So, you gonna tell me what
you thought about the show now?

1210
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,362
It was, uh...

1211
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,160
fiery.

1212
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,400
Fiery? What the fuck?

1213
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,920
That's what you thought? That's it?

1214
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,040
It was fiery. It was great.

1215
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,521
Alright. Shh, you can tell me later.

1216
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,800
So now, I gotta climb over the side
of this overturned jeep

1217
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,160
cause I got to pry the AK out

1218
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,760
from under the crushed bloody body

1219
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,320
of my now inconveniently
deceased guide, right?

1220
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,120
And just as I get this thing out
I spin around.

1221
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,880
And this fucking thing
starts to charge and it got a...

1222
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,520
Fucker took two mags to the head.

1223
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,965
Turned that bitch into a trophy.

1224
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,840
What about you, Cash?

1225
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,000
You ever had to bust a cap in anybody's ass?

1226
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,840
- Green, no...
- Shut the fuck up,!

1227
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,800
I'm talking to the man of the hour here.

1228
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,245
Come on man, have a seat.

1229
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,841
Come on.

1230
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,040
I want to hear about some of that
Oakland gangster shit, man.

1231
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,040
- Oaktown.
- Just right here?

1232
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,645
- Just sit down?
- Yeah.

1233
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,760
Well...

1234
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,960
Luckily, I have not had
to put a cap in anyone's ass.

1235
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,680
Or head or anything.

1236
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:52,367
So, I don't have any cool stories, sorry.

1237
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:56,246
Alright, well I mean
give us something. Right?

1238
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,170
These boring cunts are at
every single one of my parties.

1239
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,800
You're different, man. Make an impression.

1240
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,480
At least take off the white voice.

1241
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,560
And I know you can bust a rap, right?

1242
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:07,120
No, actually I can't.

1243
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,600
Bullshit. Come on. Bullshit.

1244
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,680
I can't, man.

1245
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,680
I mean I can listen to rap,
well, but I just can't rap.

1246
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,080
It's actually embarrassing.

1247
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,440
I don't know. I think he's lying.

1248
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,680
I think you can rap.

1249
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,360
I think you should rap.

1250
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,120
Rap, rap, rap...

1251
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,440
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap.

1252
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,200
Rap, rap, rap.

1253
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,720
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap.

1254
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,404
Rap, rap, rap.

1255
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,840
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap.

1256

<i># Nigger shit. Nigger shit.
Nigger, nigger, nigger shit #</i>

1275

1280
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,440
Go through that big ass foyer.

1281
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,200
Go through the door next to the stairs.

1282
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,886
Go down the other stairs. Hang a left.

1283
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,120
Go to the end of the hallway.

1284
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,600
Then make a right.

1285
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,762
You'll see it.

1286
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,040
Big magenta colored doors
at the end of the hall.

1287
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,480
Steve Lift will be waiting for you.

1288
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,561
He wants you in there.

1289
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,640
Look here, young blood. We don't cry
about the shit that should be.

1290
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,000
We just thrive on what is and what is...

1291
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,366
opportunity.

1292
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,684
This could be big, Cassius.

1293
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,282
Don't do that thing.

1294
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,767
- What thing?
- That thing where you fuck it up.

1295
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,000
Clean yourself up.

1296
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,080
##

1297
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,761
Heads up.

1298
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,084
This place is fucking nuts, man.

1299
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,043
Thank you. I will accept
your backhanded compliment.

1300
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,811
Please. Take a seat, Mr. Cassius Green.

1301
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,000
- How's your head, you alright?
- No, it's perfect.

1302
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,480
Well, here, in this lair

1303
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,080
we do no line before its time.

1304
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,240
And for you, my friend, it is time.

1305
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,920
Cause you are rolling with the big dogs now.

1306
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,411
Fuck it!

1307
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,120
Fuck! It's strong, man!

1308
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,480
Oh, yeah. I have a proposition for you, Cash.

1309
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,800
And I want to listen to your
proposition, Stevie.

1310
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,720
I want you at WorryFree.

1311
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,680
I see something in you.

1312
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,280
I think that you are more

1313
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,960
than just the world's greatest telemarketer

1314
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,440
since Hal Jameson.

1315
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,520
You know what that's very interesting.

1316
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,560
Boring, though.

1317
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,440
I want to talk about the dollars

1318
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,000
and zeros and the commas and shit.

1319
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,720
Cocky. I like it.

1320
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,520
Watch this little video proposal
we put together

1321
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,200
and you'll understand everything. Alright?

1322
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,720
You know, I kind of got to piss.

1323
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,200
So, could we, like, kind of watch this

1324
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,560
after I get back from the bathroom?

1325
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,641
No.

1326
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,640
Hella gotta piss, man.

1327
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,400
Okay fine. Out the door,

1328
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,320
halfway down the hallway, jade door.

1329
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,561
Jade door, okay.

1330
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,407
Okay...

1331
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,121
Wow...

1332
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,161
Alright...

1333
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,200
Serious?

1334
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,486
One stall.

1335
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,760
Hey, you on your way in or out, man?

1336
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,171
Can you help me?

1337
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,320
No. No, I can't. Sorry.

1338
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,600
Please. Could you help me?

1339
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,650
Fucked up, man. I'm really hurt.

1340
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,043
Oh, shit. Okay.

1341
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,885
Just hold on, man.

1342
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:17,921
##

1343
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,800
- Please... help me.
- Fuck!

1344
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,840
Help me! Help me!

1345
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,360
No, no, no, no, no, no! Don't touch me.

1346
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,602
- Help us!
- Help me!

1347
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,240
Hey, dumb fuck!

1348
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,721
What the fuck, man!

1349
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,800
- I said the jade door.
- That is the jade door.

1350
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,040
No, that's an olive door.

1351
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,400
That's very clearly an olive door.

1352
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,600
That's a jade door.

1353
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,400
Look, you got to get me the fuck out of here.

1354
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,643
Okay, calm, calm. This is
a big misunderstanding. Okay?

1355
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,280
Let's just take a deep breath and calm down.

1356
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,480
We're gonna go back to my office.

1357
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,080
I'm gonna explain everything to you, alright?

1358
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,360
Wait, do you still have to pee?

1359
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,360
I mean, I pissed on myself, man.

1360
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,280
So, no I don't have to pee.

1361
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,840
Look, I got to get the fuck out of here.

1362
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,001
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1363
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,800
Here's the deal.

1364
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,120
I can't let you leave without
explaining everything. Alright?

1365
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,520
And if you'd even seen the video

1366
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,520
before you went in there
you wouldn't even be scared.

1367
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,967
What the fuck was that thing in there, man?

1368
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,241
It's...

1369
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,440
the video is gonna show you everything.

1370
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,726
Don't worry about it.

1371
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,201
There's a lot of production value in this.

1372
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,720
<i>Since the dawn of time,</i>

1373
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,720
<i>or least since before anyone

1374
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,121
<i>we have used our wits to survive.</i>

1375

<i>But what has allowed us to thrive</i>

1376
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,080
<i>was our use of tools.</i>

1377
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,288
<i>A natural development.</i>

1378
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,000
<i>But what are tools</i>

1379
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,000
<i>if not extensions of the appendages</i>

1380

<i>Humans have modified ourselves

1382
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,920
<i>We train ourselves to fight.</i>

1383
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,960
<i>We work out.</i>

1384
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,600

1387
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,650
<i>We realize that human labor
has its limitations.</i>

1388
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,840
<i>And, so, our scientists

1389
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:54,080
<i>A chemical change to make humans stronger,</i>

<i>will be a part of that history.</i>

1399
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,080
See? It's all just a big misunderstanding.

1400
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,360
This ain't no fucking misunderstanding, man!

1401
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,680
So, you making half-human,
half-horse fucking things

1402
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,160
so you can make more money?

1403
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,480
Yeah, basically.

1404
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,120
I just didn't want you to think I was crazy.

1405
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,560
That I was doing this for no reason.

1406
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,000
Because this isn't irrational.

1407
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,480
Oh.

1408
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,766
Cool. Alright.

1409
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,120
Cool. No, I understand.

1410
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,920
I just... I just got to leave now, man.

1411
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,920
So, please get the fuck out of my way.

1412
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,040
We haven't finished the movie.

1413
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,480
Call me about that next week, please.

1414
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,080
And then we'll talk about it.

1415
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,200
Sit in that chair

1416
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,240
and we're gonna watch this movie.

1417
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,084
And then I'm gonna make you a proposal.

1418
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,566
Come on.

1419
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,880
<i>Our worker modification process</i>

1420
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,803

01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,888
<i>It works for 70% of humans</i>

1422

<i>who take the fusing catalyst.</i>

1423
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,840
And, see, this is how we begin

1424
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,120
the process of the transformation.

1425
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,407
They take what's called the
fusing catalyst. And what happens is...

1426
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute, man.

1427
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,160
What the fuck did you give me to snort? Huh?

1428
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,000
What the... what the fuck was that?

1429
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,400
- Wait, what?
- What did I snort?!

1430
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,720
Cause I'm, I'm not even fucking high.

1431
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,720
You're not what? Wait, wait wait. Wait.

1432
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,440
No, I don't give a fuck
about that anymore, alright?

1433
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:55,760
I don't give a fuck about that shit.

1434
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,080
If you had me snort some shit

1435
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,320
that's gonna have me mutated, man,

1436
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,040
I want you to fucking shoot me!

1437
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,400
Cash. What you snorted was
100% Peruvian, man.

1438
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:05,200
I need you to be a little bit
more particular, man.

1439
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,080
You know, they got fucking
horses in Peru, probably.

1440
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,040
- Motherfucker!
- You're gonna get semantic on me?

1441
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,200
No, I'm not getting semantic.

1442
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,680
You're the one that's being semantic

1443
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,480
if you refer to the fucking horses as a 100%.

1444
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,040
Fuck that. It doesn't even matter.

1445
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,360
Was it coke? Was it not coke?

1446
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,200
- What was it?
- Cash. It was coke.

1447
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,280
Calm down, man.

1448
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,080
You're... I wouldn't just give you

1449
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,760
the fusing catalyst without telling you.

1450
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,080
I'm not evil. Okay?

1451
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,600
The reason you're not high

1452
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,440
is because your adrenaline
is pumping so hard right now

1453
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,960
that to be perfectly honest

1454
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,840
you're starting to harsh both
of our mellows. Okay?

1455
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,680
So, sit down and just take a breath, man.

1456
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,760
It's fucking adrenaline.

1457
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,720
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1458
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,960
It's fine, okay. Just breathe.

1459
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:46,802
Okay?

1460
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,640
This is fucking weird shit.

1461
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,600
Okay?

1462
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:55,685
Now, the proposal that
I want to make you is this...

1463
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,560
That is the future of labor. Okay?

1464
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,640
They're bigger. They're stronger.

1465
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,240
They hopefully gripe a lot less.

1466
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:07,240
And also, soon, I'm gonna
have millions of them.

1467
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,360
Fucking crazy...

1468
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,080
They're gonna form their own society.

1469
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,000
They'll probably form their own culture.

1470
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,680
Then maybe they want to organize.

1471
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,200
Maybe they want to rebel.

1472
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,520
And that's why we need someone on the inside

1473
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,922
who represents WorryFree's needs.

1474
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,088
Someone they can relate to.

1475
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,320
Talking about a manager

1476
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,920
for fucking horse people.

1477
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,120
No. No.

1478
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:36,160
The Equisapien Martin Luther King, Junior.

1479
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,640
But one that we create.

1480
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,600
One that we control.

1481
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,760
So, you want to...
want to have a false leader

1482
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,800
for these fucking horse people.

1483
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,160
But at the same time, he works for you?

1484
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,527
Yeah. Keeps shit simple.

1485
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,480
Well, why the fuck did you choose me?

1486
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,880
Out of everybody you could have chose,
why did you pick me?

1487
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,400
- For what?
- Cash. Cash.

1488
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,080
You are awesome.

1489
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,520
I've never seen anyone go through the ranks

1490
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,600
at RegalView like you did.

1491
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,880
And I want someone like that at WorryFree.

1492
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,240
Someone hungry.

1493
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,480
Someone who'll fucking shank
their own friend in the back

1494
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,920
if it means getting what they want.

1495
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,840
Now, look, I can see that you're freaked out.

1496
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,160
And that you want to say no.

1497
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,846
But I wouldn't do that before
you see what I'm offering.

1498
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,680
No, man. No, no.

1499
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,125
There's no fucking amount of money

1500
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,640
that will make me do that shit.

1501
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:38,920
Two things.

1502
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,800
One: it's a short-term contract.

1503
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,840
Five years. Done.

1504
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,640
Then we give you the diffuser antidote

1505
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,040
special sauce serum

1506
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,440
and you're back to normal.

1507
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,040
And the second one,
and I want you to remember this.

1508
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,407
You're gonna have a horse cock.

1509
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:59,040
What the fuck is a special antidote
sauce serum? What the f...

1510
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,566
It sounds like you made that shit up, man.
That shit ain't real.

1511
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,400
No, it's real. And so is my offer.

1512
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,200
Five years as our man amongst horses.

1513
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,851
For one hundred million dollars.

1514
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,040
Just go sleep on it. Okay?

1515
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,727
And after that, holla at your boy. Okay?

1516
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,610
Get out in that party and go fuck something.

1517
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,804
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1518
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,966
Fuck! Fuck!

1519
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,563
Where's my cell phone?

1520
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,280
<i>San Francisco Chronicle, good morning.</i>

1521
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,200
Um... Eric. Eric Arnold, please.

1522

<i>Hello.</i>

01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:30,000
Okay, Eric Arnold. My name is Cassius Green.

1525
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,367
I have some important information.

1526
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,880
Some very, very important information

1527
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,880
that I think you would really,
really be interested in.

1528
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,880
- <i>Okay, shoot.</i>
- Okay, uh... alright.

1529
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,960
They turning motherfuckers into horse-people.

1530
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,280
Horse... half-horse, half-human
people that work. Alright.

1531
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,400
Look, they have you snort some fucking coke,

1532
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,600
and, well, it's not really coke,

1533
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,040
but you snort it and it has
your nostrils get all big

1534
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,480
and then you get a horse dick and shit.

1535
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,880
And listen... listen, you got
to get this story out here, man,

1536
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,840
because look, you put...

- <i>Cassius Green.</i>

1554
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,000
Alright Doc, now I'm, uh...

1555
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,520
I got a little worried, you know.

1556
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,480
Because I was looking at it
maybe from up here.

1557
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,480
But that it might be different.

1558
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,766
Is it bigger?

1559
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,480
No. No, it's the same size.

1560
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,040
I mean, I'm glad you're feeling yourself.

1561
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,360
Is that why you tried to
booty call me last night?

1562
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,760
I didn't try to booty call you.
I lost my phone. I told you.

1563
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,560
It doesn't matter. I got a new one.

1564
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,160
What is up with you, Cash?

1565
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,480
You called me at 3:23.
You left a video message.

1566
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:19,520
I didn't check it,

1567
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,920
cause I assumed it was lewd as fuck
and I wasn't trying to do that...

1568
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,127
Can I see that?

1569
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,567

You got to do something. People got to know.

Right? Honey, you got to tell them, right?

Yeah. Yeah I mean...

- Why did you show...
- I don't know, alright.

1585
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,040
I snorted something that was...

1586
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,400
I thought it was activated

1587
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,200
but it turned out it was just coke...

1588

But why did you focus on your dick, though?

1589
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,320
They have big nostrils

1590
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,164
you could have just asked me
to check your nostrils.

1591
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,850
- Okay check 'em, check 'em.
- Okay, okay.

1592
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,520
Yeah, they look bigger.

1593
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,240
- No, they don't.
- I think that's just cause...

1594
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,160
- Yeah. You're flaring them.
- No, I'm not flaring them.

1595
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,480
- You are, you are.
- No, I'm not.

1596
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,051
Just relax them a little bit so I can see.

1597
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:44,600
Okay. Look, listen. They're normal size.
They look normal size.

1598
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,205
They look normal size.

1599
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,800
I need you to know...

1600
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,040
I want to be clear...

1601
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,800
this can't happen again.

1602
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:15,560
I'm not going back.

1603
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:18,120
I'm not going to be a fucking Power Caller.

1604
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,930
That's a good decision.

1605
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,320
But I...

1606
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,280
- I still have problems with all this.
- I'm not...

1607
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:25,360
Only something happening to you
turned you against them.

1608
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,080
Okay. But I know how they view me.

1609
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,240
How I look in the eyes

1610
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,160
of fucking WorryFree and RegalView.

1611
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,680
They just view me as another one
of their fucking creatures

1612
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:37,525
to control and to manipulate.
And that's not me.

1613
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:40,721
Good.

1614
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,281
Good.

1615
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,324
That doesn't change what I said about us.

1616
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,880
And also, I kind of messed around

1617
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:53,920
with somebody last night.

1618
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,650
What? Wait...

1619
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,480
what do you mean you kind of...

1620
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,120
I need you to explain that one

1621
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,200
cause I don't understand

1622
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:05,126
what you mean by you kind of
messed around with somebody.

1623
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,280
- I mean did you...
- Everything but.

1624
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,440
Everything but.

1625
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,681
You see, that's almost worse than

1626
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,360
anything I can imagine in my mind.

1627
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,445
- Everything but. So, did you...
- Cassius, we were broken up.

1628
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,680
Okay? It's over.

1629
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,081
It's me and you that shouldn't have
messed around tonight.

1630
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,443
You want to know who it was?

1631
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,320
Do you plan on fucking

1632
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,971
or "everything but" -ting
with that person again?

1633
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,281
No.

1634
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,171
Nah. No, I don't want to know, then.

1635
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,769
No, I don't want to know.

1636
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,245
##

1637
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,407
I have absolutely no idea what this is about.

1638
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,800
Maybe it's saying that
capitalism dehumanizes them.

1639
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:30,280
Maybe the artist is being literal.

1640
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:33,240
Maybe WorryFree is
turning workers into horses.

1641
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,163
And literally fucking them?

1642
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,720
##

1643
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:48,720
Hey, bro.

1644
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,120
Ain't you the dude from the clip

1645
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,640
that got hit in the head with the can?

1646
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,080
No. No, everybody thinks that's me, man.

1647
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,208
- But that's not me.
- What's wrong with your head then?

1648
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,720
Damn, everybody thinks that's...

1649
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,280
That's you, that shit is funny!

1650
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,364
- What the fuck, man?!
- Why you lyin'?

1651
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,361
That's alright.

1652
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:16,801
Happen to the best of us.

1653
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,801
Walk it off.

1654
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,160
This is Cassius Green

1655
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,480
from "Have-A-Cola-And-A-Smile-Bitch" fame.

1656
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:36,971
I want to be on your show tomorrow.

1657
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:42,491
<i>"Have a Cola and smile, Bitch"</i>

"I Got the Shit Kicked Out Of Me".

1659
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:59,400
Today, YouTube sensation
Cassius Green is here.

1660
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,760
You had 500 million people

1661
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,040
watch you get pegged to the noggin

1662
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,440
and get utterly humiliated.
It was effin hilarious.

1663
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,200
The way your hair went up like that...

1664
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,760
The whole world is laughing 'til they pissed.

1665
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,080
Well, I got a new clip
that I need you to play

1666
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:16,880
and the only reason I came on the show

1667
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,760
was because you agreed to show this clip

1668
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,040
to your 150 million viewers.

1669
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,000
Well, if you want some ass,
you have to bring some ass.

1670
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,520
So, we'll get ready for an ass whipping,

1671
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:25,920
then jump in the shit tank.

1672
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,320
Then we'll play your clip.

1673
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,205
##

1674
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,560
Could you play my clip now, please?

1675
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,560
Okay.

1676
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,880
Is it as crazy as the
cola-and-a-smile-bitch clip?

1677
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:55,200
Not possible.

1678
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,800
It's crazy, Mary.

1679
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,360
- It's fucking crazy.
- Woo-hoo.

1680
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,920
Let's roll the clip.

1681
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,840
<i>Help us. We're hurting!</i>

1682
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,002
<i>We're hurting!</i>

1683
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,600
<i>If you beautiful perversions
don't shut the fuck up,</i>

1684
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:13,440
<i>I will turn you all into glue!</i>

1685
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,280
As a Power Caller for RegalView,

1686
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,960
WorryFree was my premier client.

1687
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,160
This is just incontrovertible proof

1688
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:24,280
of WorryFree's evil practices.

1689
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:27,320
They're turning humans into
grotesque horse-people.

1690
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,240
<i>And I want the world to know</i>

1691
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,280
<i>that... that... that they're

<i>for the sake of profit.</i>

1693
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,560
<i>Now, we cannot let this go on.</i>

1694
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,720
<i>You have to call your congressman, alright.</i>

1695
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,040
<i>Call your local politicians</i>

1696
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,480
<i>and let them know we will not stand for this.</i>

1697
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:42,920

1710
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,680
<i>you from flop house, you from drop house...</i>

1711
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,160
- Stop! Stop!
- <i>Out devil!</i>

1712
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:21,241
Stop!

1713
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,402
No. No. We're just doing dutch.

1714
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,723
- Thanks for calling, man.
- Yeah.

1715
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,291
Look, I betrayed you.

1716
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,650
I know it's not gonna change anything,

1717
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,280
but I wanted to say I'm sorry.

1718
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:51,570
- I acted stupid, I was...
- Man, hey, we... we good.

1719
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,880
Alright, but all you got to do is just...

1720
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,560
just do right from now on, man.

1721
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:58,160
Yeah, I know and that's what...

1722
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:00,960
I tried to change it.
I tried to stop it. But it's...

1723
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,440
it's just right in front of their faces.

1724
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:05,120
They're turning human beings
into monstrosities

1725
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,440
and nobody gives a fuck.

1726
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,080
Most people that saw you on that screen

1727
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,520
knew calling their congressman
wasn't gonna do shit.

1728
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,760
If you get shown a problem,

1729
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,360
but have no idea how to control it,

1730
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,680
then you just decide to get
used to the problem.

1731
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,651
Yeah, and that's why our plan for tomorrow...

1732
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,640
is important.

1733
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:23,840
'Cause if we stop them

1734
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,120
from crossing the picket line
this time, we win.

1735
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,960
- That's a good plan.
- Yeah.

1736
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,327
Tomorrow we show 'em how to give fucks.

1737
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,560
Ain't that about a blip.

1738
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:41,520
- Happy Halloween
- Look at that shit. You see that shit?

1739
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,640
What the fuck is that about?
What the fuck, man?

1740
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,245
That's what I'm talking about.

1741
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:54,288
- <i>Get back in there!</i>
- <i>We're hurting! Help us!</i>

1742
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,169
<i>Security code cleared.</i>

1743
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,480
Fuck you, RegalView!

1744
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,920
Fuck you, RegalView! Fuck you, RegalView!

1745
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,320
None of the strikers here
at the RegalView strike

1746
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,240
will tell us why they're all wearing

1747
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,720
their Cola-And A-Smile-Bitch wigs.

1748
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,480
Although the strikers have been

1749
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:25,680
extremely militant over the past weeks,

1750
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,680
they've not been able to stop
the Stackwater juggernaut

1751
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,520
from breaking through the lines.

1752
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:33,520
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

1753
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,600
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

1754
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,760
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

1755
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,760
Elbows and assholes, people!

1756
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:42,841
Let's go!

1757
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,960
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!...

1758
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,280
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

1759
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:59,080
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

1760
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,880
Scabs won't pass!

1761
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,720
Scabs won't pass! Scabs won't pass!

1762
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:09,920
Oh!

1763
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,920
The infamous Cassius Green,

1764
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,560
former Power Caller and strike line crosser,

1765
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,244
has switched sides.

1766
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,163
- Yeah, man!
- Yeah!

1767
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,680
Looks like the calvary's arrived, folks.

1768
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:08,560
Get the fuck back!

1769
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,085
This way! This way!

1770
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,440
Come on!

1771
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:19,920
Over here! Over here!

1772
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:25,800
This is when the magic happens.

1773
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,610
Get them here quick.

1774
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:36,451
Hey, Cassius.

1775
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,565
Look out! Look out!

1776
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:02,440
Hey! Hey!

1777
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,245
Let me out!

1778
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,685
Hey!

1779
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:33,844
Hold your ground!

1780
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,760
Yes! Yes!

1781
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,481
Wow!

1782
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,680
Thank you.

1783
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,040
We. Are Honored.

1784
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,040
To. Be. In. Your. Presence.

1785
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:31,000
Dude. I'm from East Oakland.

1786
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,560
Talk regular.

1787
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,290
My name is DeMarius.

1788
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,640
Thanks for breaking us out.

1789
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:39,441
Oh, I'm Cassius. Cassius Green.

1790
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,561
No problem.

1791
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,010
WorryFree is here.

1792
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:48,248
Hey. Same struggle.

1793
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,521
Same fight.

1794
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,927
Equisapiens! Let's be out!

1795
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:05,445
Equisapiens, thank you so much!

1796
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,640
Hey!

1797
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,730
Mastermind.

1798
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,560
Are you serious right now?

1799
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:53,404
Serious as kicking the can.

1800
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,880
Don't... don't play with me, Cash

1801
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,520
cause that's some serious shit.

1802
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:59,120
No, man. That's yours.

1803
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:01,360
And I've got a car that'll do me just fine

1804
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,283
til I get back to work at RegalView.

1805
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,280
Plus, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

1806
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,647
Cash, man. Look.

1807
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:13,802
Just saying sorry is fine.

1808
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:18,320
This is good. This is perfect.

1809
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,480
This is the perfect apology.

1810
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:22,564
I don't want disrespect you.
You know this is cool, I'm...

1811
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,001
Hey!

1812
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:31,600
So, uh...

1813
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:33,920
now that we won that strike

1814
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,760
you cool coming back to work with us

1815
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,000
lowly regular telemarketers.

1816
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,640
Well, if the new and glorious

1817
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:42,880
telemarketers union will have me.

1818
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,644
You got to start fighting somewhere.

1819
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,760
- Huh?
- Alright, bro.

1820
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,285
- Be good.
- Mm-hmm.

1821
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,124
Kiss already, y'all.

1822
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:03,486
So, what about being part
of something important, huh?

1823
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,560
Oh, shit.

1824
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:07,880
It looks like the sun is about to explode.

1825
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:08,920
Oh, my God...

1826
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,001
Come here, sugar.

1827
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,443
We are a part of something important.

1828
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:17,965
Changing the world.

1829
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:22,170
Before the sun explodes.

1830
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:27,960
Well...

1831
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:30,320
I couldn't come back to the exact same thing

1832
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,482
after all that, right?

1833
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:43,920
What happened?

1834
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,291
What, Cash?

1835
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,369

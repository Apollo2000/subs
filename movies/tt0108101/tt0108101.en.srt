1
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,185
Amen.

2
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,519
Amen.

3
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,587
How'd it go, Tom?

4
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,422
Thrashed them.
Led all the way.

5
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,924
Thank you, Perkins.

6
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,294
The new ones are trouble this evening,
Christopher.

7
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,796
Any news of Julian?
I suppose he's all right, is he?

8
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:25,864
Julian, yes, he's fine.

9
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,399
I think he went down to London.

10
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,201
I ordered the '45.

11
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,372
Jack. Jack,
I don't seem to...

12
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:34,740
Jack, what a surprise.

13
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,074
What do you mean surprise?

14
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,242
Not out plying your trade?

15
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,310
Doesn't suit you,
Desmond.

16
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,911
What trade is that, Christopher?

17
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:43,448
I see you as a species of medieval peddler
selling relics of the saints

18
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,450
of dubious authenticity.

19
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,454
Fair play, Christopher. Jack's no Roman.
I can vouch for that.

20
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,457
I speak metaphorically, Harry.
Jack's trade is the manufacture

21
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,260
and supply of easy answers
to difficult questions.

22
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,962
What's he say?

23
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,597
He says Jack has...

24
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,565
-Rupert, I wonder if I could...
-Warnie...

25
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,935
I've been meaning to ask you
about your brother's books.

26
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,504
Does he actually know any children?

27
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,239
Children? Jack?
I don't think so.

28
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,640
How on earth does he pull it off?

29
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,576
Barker, this isn't
the Chambertin '45.

30
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,945
To the best of my belief, it is, sir.

31
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,447
-Just one moment, sir.
-No, Nick.

32
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,250
No, you do not agree with Marcus.
You disagree with Marcus.

33
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:20,619
But Marcus says he agrees with me...

34
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,955
Marcus has no real grasp of his own
thought processes.

35
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,124
Also, he tells the most terrible lies.

36
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,260
I'm intrigued, Jack. Apparently,

37
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,329
you don't know any actual children.

38
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,863
That's balderdash.

39
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:35,167
I'm sure Rupert can spare
one or two of his brood.

40
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,769
Jack, you forgot my wine.

41
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,639
It's there.

42
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:41,807
Thank you, barker.

43
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:42,874
I don't see why...

44
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,309
Who says I don't know any children?

45
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,044
-Who?
-Warnie.

46
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,948
My brother was a child once, Rupert.

47
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,918
And, as unlikely as
it may seem, so was I.

48
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,121
It's Thursday tomorrow, Jack.

49
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:59,024
The week's almost gone and I haven't
done half my letters.

50
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,292
You don't have to write back...

51
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:01,693
Don't have to write back, I know.

52
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,528
It only encourages them.

53
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,163
Yes, yes, yes.

54
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,666
"Mr. C.S. Lewis
thanks you for your letter,

55
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,802
"but has nothing
whatsoever to say in reply."

56
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,173
It's going to be
quite a frost tonight, Warnie.

57
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,709
Too many stars.
Confuses me.

58
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,725
Nightcap?

59
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,927
I don't think so.

60
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,558
Now, now...

61
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:06,558
London tomorrow.

62
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,061
Who are you lecturing,
disabled veterans?

63
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,698
Church widows?

64
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,500
Association of
Christian teachers.

65
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,945
'Night, Jack.

66
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,547
'Night, Warnie.

67
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:44,596
A garden, enclosed by a high wall. 
Inside the garden, a fountain.

68
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,899
In the fountain,
two crystal stones.

69
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,570
In the crystals,
in reflection, a rose garden.

70
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:55,173
In the midst of the roses,
one perfect rosebud.

71
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,879
Guillaume de lorris is using the 
rosebud, of course, as an image.

72
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,582
But an image of what?

73
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:04,616
Love?

74
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:05,851
What kind of love?

75
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:10,088
Untouched?
Unopened like a bud?

76
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,656
Yes, more.

77
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,291
Perfect love?

78
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,595
What makes it perfect?
Come on. Wake up.

79
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,263
Is it the courtly ideal of love?

80
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,867
What is that? What is its 
one essential quality?

81
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,102
Unattainability.

82
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:28,573
The most intense joy lies not 
in the having but in the desiring.

83
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,444
The delight that never fades...

84
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:37,148
The bliss that is eternal is only 
yours when what you most desire

85
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,550
is just out of reach.

86
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:41,786
What was that, Mr. Whistler?

87
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,722
Nothing, Mr. Lewis.

88
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,191
If you disagree with me, say so.

89
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,360
Fight me. I can take it.

90
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:52,464
Even I can't fight on both 
sides at once, you know.

91
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,367
At least I can, but I'm liable to win.

92
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,040
Why is the beer in
this pub always cold?

93
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,141
Now, Mr. Egan.

94
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,175
Cold beer.

95
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,311
Chills the stomach.
Has no taste.

96
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,313
I have a complaint 
about the wardrobe.

97
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,682
Complaint?
Our children love it.

98
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,584
I will not have
another blasted conversation

99
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,519
about Jack's blasted nursery.

100
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,421
No. No, listen, listen.

101
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,856
In the book, you describe the house

102
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,991
as belonging to an old professor

103
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:23,395
who has no wife, and yet...

104
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,398
You say that when the little girl
enters the magic wardrobe

105
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,333
she finds it full of fur coats.

106
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,068
Very good, Eddie.

107
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,403
Not bad.

108
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,705
It's simple. They belong to
the professor's old mother.

109
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:34,773
Simple.

110
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,409
So to reach the
magic world

111
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,211
the child must push through
the "mother's fur"?

112
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,680
No. I won't have that,
John. That's none of

113
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,081
your hand-me-down freudianism...

114
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,751
But the imagery is Christian, surely?

115
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,354
No, Harry, it's what it is.
It's just itself.

116
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,291
It's... it's just magic.

117
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,927
Magic. Look.

118
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:01,466
Let me show you. The child 
steps into the wardrobe.

119
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,101
The coats are thick and heavy.

120
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,270
What about the fur?

121
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,038
Fur's not important, John.

122
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,908
The child must push through.

123
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,744
They're pressing close,
almost suffocating

124
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:17,616
and suddenly, there's white 
light. Crisp, cold air.

125
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,385
Trees. Snow.

126
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,253
Total contrast, you see.

127
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,623
It's the gateway to a magical world.

128
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,762
What time is it?

129
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,597
Good Lord, my train.

130
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,466
Anyway. Well...

131
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,737
See you all tomorrow. Bye.

132
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:39,904
Bye.

133
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,072
Cheerio, Jack. See you then.

134
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,540
Goodbye, Mr. Lewis.

135
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,181
Yesterday, I received a letter

136
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,917
that referred to an
event that took place

137
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,588
almost a year ago now.
December 4, 1951.

138
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,325
My correspondent hadn't forgotten.
I doubt if any of us have.

139
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,793
That was the night

140
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,429
a number one bus
drove into a column

141
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,297
of young royal marine cadets

142
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,601
in Chatham and killed 24 of them.

143
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,336
You remember?

144
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:17,375
And the letter asks some simple 
but fundamental questions.

145
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,348
Where was God
on that December night?

146
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,283
Why didn't he stop it?

147
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,154
Isn't God supposed to be good?

148
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,423
Isn't he supposed to love us?

149
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,860
And does God want us to suffer?

150
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:42,500
What if the answer
to that question is yes?

151
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,336
'Cause I'm not sure that God 
particularly wants us to be happy.

152
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,806
I think he wants us to be 
able to love and be loved.

153
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,741
He wants us to grow up.

154
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,913
I suggest to you that it is
because God loves us

155
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,981
that he makes us
the gift of suffering.

156
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,818
To put it another way,

157
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,155
pain is God's megaphone
to rouse a deaf world.

158
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,160
You see, we are like
blocks of stone

159
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,529
out of which the sculptor carves

160
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,264
the forms of men.

161
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,334
The blows of his chisel,
which hurt us so much

162
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,305
are what make us perfect.

163
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,642
Thank you very much.

164
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,586
A woman has had 
a dream about me.

165
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,523
She writes to ask
if I've had a dream about her.

166
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,895
I had a strange dream last night.

167
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,798
Another letter from Mrs. Gresham?

168
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,233
I can't remember any of it.

169
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,235
The Jewish, communist,
Christian American?

170
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:54,105
You may ask me how I know 
it was strange if I've forgotten it.

171
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,607
Can't answer that one.

172
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,444
I like her letters. She can 
be quite sharp sometimes.

173
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,446
Listen to this, Warnie.

174
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,784
She says, "I can't decide whether 
you'd rather be the child

175
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:11,055
"caught in the spell or 
the magician casting it."

176
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,124
Her letters are rather unusual.

177
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,227
She writes as if she 
knows me somehow.

178
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:19,397
Still, I suppose there is something 
of me in my books, isn't there?

179
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,802
I expect it's just the American style.

180
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,738
Americans don't understand
about inhibitions.

181
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,708
She's coming to England.

182
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,746
No, she's coming to Oxford.
She wants to meet us.

183
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,247
Well, she can't come here.

184
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,348
No, of course not,

185
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,751
but she does
suggest tea in a hotel.

186
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:42,320
Tea is safe.
A hotel is safe.

187
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,857
Though she might be mad.

188
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:48,493
No, I don't think so.
She does write poems.

189
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,029
Poems?

190
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,332
She'll be barking.

191
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,938
You won't be too agreeable, 
will you, Jack?

192
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,173
Don't worry, Warnie. I won't.

193
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:21,059
She'll turn out to be writing 
a dissertation on wardrobes.

194
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,995
She'll ask whether she can come 
and watch you while you create.

195
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:27,799
She'll say, "I'll sit in a corner.
You'll never know I'm there."

196
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,901
It's only tea, Warnie.

197
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,070
An hour or so of polite 
conversation, then we go home,

198
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,739
and everything goes on
just the way it always has.

199
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,642
Shall we have some sandwiches?

200
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,044
I wonder if they 
do toasted teacakes?

201
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,720
Excuse me, I'm here to meet 
Mr. C.S. Lewis, the writer.

202
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,154
Yes, madam.

203
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,993
Well, do you know
what he looks like?

204
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,194
No, madam.

205
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,662
Well, he doesn't know
what I look like, either.

206
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,097
Yes, madam.

207
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,333
Any ideas?

208
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,735
No, madam.

209
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,744
Anybody here called Lewis?

210
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,792
Mrs. Gresham? How do you do?

211
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,860
A pleasure.

212
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,028
This is my brother, Warnie.

213
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,863
Major Lewis.

214
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,798
Now, please, sit down.

215
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,468
So you managed to find us.

216
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,437
Yes, I used the guide,

217
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,306
and so, you see... 
It's just that you

218
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,107
don't look at all like C.S.Lewis.

219
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,976
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

220
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:47,278
not to mention the rest of Oxford.

221
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,851
Well, so you don't like that?

222
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,426
Well, I'm not what you might call
a public figure, Mrs. Gresham.

223
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,560
Oh, you're not?

224
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,395
I mean, you write all these books,

225
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,897
and you give all those talks,

226
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:07,999
and everything just so everybody
will leave you alone?

227
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,569
Oh, dear.

228
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,472
We've only just met, and already 
you see right through me.

229
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,676
Tell me, do you drink tea?

230
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:19,777
Tea, sure.

231
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,079
It's England, right?

232
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,246
So it is.

233
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,314
Waiter.

234
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,091
Actually, look, I'm a little in awe 
of you, and so I'm a little tense.

235
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:36,260
And when I get like that,
I get kind of... I don't know.

236
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,598
It's very childish. I'm sure 
I'll get over it soon.

237
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,633
Not too soon, I hope, please,

238
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,602
'cause I like a good fight myself.

239
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,703
You do?

240
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:46,771
Yes.

241
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,272
You sound surprised.

242
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:53,511
No. No, that's great.
You like a good fight. Great.

243
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,181
But?

244
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,852
When's the last time you lost?

245
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,457
Well, I've been at 
Magdalen since 1925.

246
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,960
It's just beautiful here. 
How old is it?

247
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:12,063
The college was founded
very nearly 500 years ago.

248
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,132
Not all the buildings
are that old, of course.

249
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,467
My room is there.
That's the new building.

250
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,635
New, huh?

251
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,870
1733.

252
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,008
What does your husband 
do, Mrs. Gresham?

253
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,110
Oh, Bill? Bill's a writer.

254
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,814
And you, too, Jack tells me.

255
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,650
You call him Jack?

256
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,485
I never liked the name Clive.

257
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,189
Well, if you're a Jack...

258
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,257
What?

259
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,993
No, you look fine for a Jack.

260
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,661
Thank you.

261
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:47,165
Well, Jewish, but not Jewish-Jewish,
if you can follow that.

262
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,033
I mean, I'm a Christian, but I was

263
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,202
brought up to be a good atheist.

264
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,403
An atheist?

265
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,272
Don't sound so shocked.

266
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:57,708
I'm not. I was an atheist once.

267
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,778
You? So we're both lapsed atheists?

268
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,015
Yes, but I was never a communist.

269
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:05,216
Why not?

270
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,185
What do you mean,
"why not," Mrs. Gresham?

271
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,521
Well, I mean, back in '38, 
it seemed to me

272
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,957
there was only two choices.
Either you were a fascist

273
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:16,861
and you conquered the world, or you 
were a communist and you saved it.

274
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,296
Is that so?

275
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:25,069
I must have been otherwise 
engaged at the time.

276
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,875
There's a world worth saving.

277
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,945
At dawn, on the first
of may every year,

278
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,880
the choristers from
the choir school

279
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:39,417
stand up here and
sing to the rising sun.

280
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,252
They say they draw
quite a crowd.

281
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,054
What do they sing?

282
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,056
I can't say I've ever risen early
enough to hear them.

283
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:47,992
Oh, why not? I mean,
it sounds wonderful.

284
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,795
Well, I don't really go in
for seeing the sights.

285
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,396
Oh!

286
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,866
So what do you do? Just walk 
around with your eyes shut?

287
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:01,572
You know, Mrs. Gresham, I almost 
don't know what to say to you.

288
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,908
Good Lord!

289
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,843
How long do you plan to stay
in England, Mrs. Gresham?

290
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,578
Till the end of December.

291
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,347
Are you expecting
to be in Oxford again?

292
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,149
Well, I hadn't planned on it.

293
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,416
What do you say, Warnie?

294
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,585
Do you think we could rise
to a pot of home-brewed tea?

295
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,686
Yes, I think we can manage that.

296
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,256
Given adequate
warning, of course.

297
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:19,991
Do you think
I could bring my son?

298
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,426
Douglas is such a big fan
of your <i>Narnia</i> books.

299
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,628
He'd love to meet you.

300
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,862
Yes, of course.

301
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,833
I'll give you plenty of warning.

302
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,702
It was a pleasure meeting you, 
Mr. Lewis. Thanks for everything.

303
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,770
Well, see you soon.

304
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:33,771
Yes. Major Lewis.

305
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,839
- Mrs. Gresham.
- Safe journey.

306
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,574
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

307
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,849
Does one wait for
the train to leave?

308
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,021
Character and plot.

309
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,489
Chicken and egg.

310
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,224
Which comes first?

311
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,965
Aristotle's solution
was simple and radical.

312
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,671
He said, "plot is character."

313
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:09,574
Forget psychology. Forget 
the inside of men's heads.

314
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,243
Judge them by their actions.

315
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,546
For example, Mr. Whistler's asleep.

316
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,482
Now, from that action
I take it that

317
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,985
he has no interest
in what I have to say.

318
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,255
The puzzle is, that being the 
case, why is he here at all?

319
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:28,226
So we construct a plot
from Mr. Whistler's actions.

320
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,195
He comes. He sleeps.

321
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:35,433
Now, Aristotle would say that 
the next question is not "why?"

322
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,703
But, "what is Mr. Whistler 
going to do next?"

323
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,910
Good morning, Mr. Whistler.

324
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,080
You know, my class 
is not compulsory,

325
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,016
neither are my chairs very 
comfortable. I suggest that...

326
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:53,284
All right, I'm going.

327
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,419
Thank you.

328
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,996
He comes. He sleeps. He goes.
So the plot thickens.

329
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:28,286
It's all right, Warnie. She sails 
back to New York after Christmas.

330
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,122
One can always be so much more 
friendly to people who can't stay long.

331
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,391
I wonder what her
husband thinks of

332
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:36,260
her gallivanting
around England like this.

333
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:38,129
It's not the Middle Ages, Warnie.

334
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,798
She'll make you listen to one of 
her poems. I'll bet you 10 bob.

335
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,767
Then she'll say to you,
"how do you like it, Mr. Lewis?"

336
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,335
And you'll be stumped.

337
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,304
Then I shall say, "Mrs. Gresham,

338
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,105
"only you could have written that."

339
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,340
Blast.

340
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,581
That'll be £1.09, madam.

341
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,250
Keep the change.

342
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,758
Hello, you must be Douglas.

343
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,826
Are you him?

344
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,661
No, I'm his brother.

345
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,931
So you found us, Mrs. Gresham?

346
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,032
Well, the driver did.

347
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,334
Come in.

348
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,005
There we go.

349
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,574
There we are.

350
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,112
That's him.

351
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,147
Do go in.

352
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,350
Here you are then.

353
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,352
- Hello.
- All right. Good.

354
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,953
Hello, sorry, my hands are...

355
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,521
We really appreciate this, Mr. Lewis.

356
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,124
You've no idea how Douglas
was looking forward to today.

357
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:42,693
So you're Douglas.

358
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,528
Will he write in my book?

359
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,530
Ask him.

360
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,300
I told him you would write in his 
<i>Narnia</i> book. Do you mind?

361
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:51,068
No, of course not.

362
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,236
Yes.

363
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,142
"To Douglas," yes?

364
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,643
Douglas, yes.

365
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:05,216
Ask him about the attic.

366
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:10,988
Oh! He wants to know if you have 
an attic. You can ask him these things.

367
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,223
We do.

368
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,792
Here you are.

369
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,863
What does it say, honey?

370
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:21,165
"The magic never ends."

371
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,467
Well, if it does, sue him.

372
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,005
Thank you, Mrs. Young.
Thank you.

373
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,842
I'd sure like to see the attic.

374
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,444
Then you shall.

375
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,447
Come along, young man.
Let's go find it.

376
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:39,517
Thank you, Major Lewis.

377
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,754
Oh! Jack was particularly hoping 
that you'd introduce him to your poetry.

378
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,861
Now, we've got to find
the key. Mrs. Young...

379
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:54,899
Don't worry, I don't inflict my
poems on innocent strangers.

380
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,834
Not strangers, I hope.

381
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,640
What about some of that
long promised tea?

382
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,608
Yes, please.

383
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,410
You take milk, don't you?

384
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,545
Yes.

385
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:13,717
No, I'd be interested
to know about your poems.

386
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,753
What do you want
to know about them?

387
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,755
How long they are?

388
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:20,324
Their rhyme schemes?
Their major influences?

389
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,927
Quite right, of course.
You take sugar?

390
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,128
Sure.

391
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,298
No, you're quite right.

392
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,634
Well, would you be so kind
as to introduce me

393
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,403
to the poems themselves?

394
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:34,205
Well, I'm not sure.

395
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,108
I won't be rude about them.

396
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,246
What will you do?
Stay silent or tell lies?

397
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,915
No, I shall choose
when I've heard one.

398
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,116
All right.

399
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,419
You know, I have won
a national poetry award

400
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:50,521
shared with Robert Frost.

401
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:52,256
I'm impressed.

402
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:54,325
Well, let's hope
you stay that way.

403
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,094
Uh... let's get this
out of the way.

404
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,630
I'll give you an early one.
That way I'm covered.

405
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:03,100
I wrote this when I was 22,
Spanish civil war.

406
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,269
It's called <i>Snow in Madrid.</i>

407
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,806
"Softly, so casual

408
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,775
"lovely, so light, so light

409
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:15,379
"the cruel sky lets fall 
something one does not fight

410
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,450
"men while perishing..."

411
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:20,684
Sorry.

412
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:27,958
"Men before perishing see with
unwounded eye, for once

413
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,361
"a gentle thing fall from the sky."

414
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,399
Embarrassed, huh?

415
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,735
No, I'm touched.

416
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:39,703
- Touched?
- Yes.

417
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:44,875
Touched? That's good.
That's about its level.

418
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,044
So you may ask,
when was I ever

419
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,146
in Madrid?
The answer is, never.

420
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,048
Well, personal experience
isn't everything.

421
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,884
I disagree. I think personal
experience is everything.

422
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,121
So reading is a waste of time?

423
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:02,860
No, it's not a waste of time,
but reading is safe, isn't it?

424
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:05,362
Books aren't about to hurt you.

425
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:08,098
Why should one 
want to be hurt?

426
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,833
That's when we learn.

427
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,936
Well, just because
something hurts, it doesn't

428
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:14,071
make it more true
or more significant.

429
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,608
No, I guess not.

430
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,377
I'm not saying that pain is
purposeless or even neutral,

431
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:25,516
but to find meaning in pain,
there has to be something else.

432
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,852
Pain is a tool.

433
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:30,421
If you like, pain is 
God's megaphone...

434
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,456
Megaphone to
rouse a deaf world.

435
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,194
How embarrassing.

436
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,463
You know my writing
too well, don't you?

437
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,465
I have read most of it.

438
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,934
I guess I knew you
pretty well before we met.

439
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,173
But you'd not had
the personal experience.

440
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,812
Mr. Lewis, I...

441
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:59,984
I have to stop calling you Mr. Lewis.
It makes me feel like a kid.

442
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,885
Can I call you Jack?

443
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,621
Yes, of course.

444
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,189
Jack, I'm Joy.

445
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,094
Well, hello, Joy.

446
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,966
So, Jack...

447
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,138
Have you ever
been really hurt?

448
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,076
You don't give up,
do you?

449
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:30,014
Here we are. Mind how you go.
Let's turn a light on.

450
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,671
Does anybody ever 
come up here?

451
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,573
Not anymore.

452
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,790
Yes, of course, come in.

453
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:16,026
Right, here we are. That's 
Warnie's desk. This is mine.

454
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,830
It's not very orderly
in here, I'm afraid.

455
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,999
Well, you keep order
in your mind, right?

456
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,133
Yes.

457
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,136
Oh, that's nice.

458
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,971
Is it someplace real?

459
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,807
I think so.

460
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,142
It's called the Golden 
Valley, I believe.

461
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,210
Somewhere in Herefordshire.

462
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,712
Somewhere special?

463
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,246
In a way.

464
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:39,016
It was on our nursery
wall when I was a child.

465
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:41,418
I didn't know it
was a real place then.

466
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,620
I thought it was
a view of heaven.

467
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:45,456
The promised land.

468
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,994
Yes, I used to think
that one day

469
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,529
I'd come round
a bend in the road

470
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:54,665
or over the brow of a hill,

471
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,600
and there it would be.

472
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,676
I have been
really hurt, you know?

473
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,279
First time is always the worst.

474
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,615
That was when my mother died.

475
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,350
How old were you?

476
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,685
Nine.

477
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,086
That's old enough to hurt.

478
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,421
Oh, yes.

479
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,924
It was the end of my world.

480
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,293
I remember my father in tears.

481
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:26,029
Voices all over the house.

482
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,398
Doors shutting and opening.

483
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,769
It was a big house,
all long empty corridors.

484
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,470
I remember I had 
a toothache, and I

485
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,105
wanted my mother to come to me.

486
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,876
I cried for her to come,
but she didn't come.

487
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,112
And after death...

488
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,047
Did you believe
you'd meet her again?

489
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,383
No.

490
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,586
I don't think I had any faith in
anything when I was a child.

491
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,455
She was gone. That was all.

492
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:58,162
And still you listen for the
footsteps coming down the corridors,

493
00:29:58,164 --> 00:29:59,997
but they don't come.

494
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:03,901
Yes.

495
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,074
You should see the garden
before it gets dark.

496
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,176
Yes, I'd like that.

497
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:13,177
You'll need a coat.

498
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,145
I have one right here.

499
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,118
There's a lake, mum,
a wood with a lake.

500
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,419
Oh, good.

501
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,453
It's really a flooded Clay-pit...

502
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,755
Come and see, mum.

503
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:26,456
- ...for the old brick works.
- He's all yours now.

504
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,926
Be careful, Douglas.
Douglas.

505
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:31,161
Sun's well over the yardarm.

506
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,433
- Does he miss home?
- Oh, sure.

507
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,869
I mean, he'd like to be
home for Christmas,

508
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,438
but, well, it just hasn't
worked out that way.

509
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,942
What are you
doing for Christmas?

510
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:48,111
Some lucky English 
hotel, I expect.

511
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,180
So your husband will have 
to look after himself. Is that it?

512
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,383
Yes, he's pretty good at that.

513
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,353
The lake is much older than 
the house, of course.

514
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,225
They say Shelley used
to sail paper boats here.

515
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,395
All made out of early drafts
of his poems, no doubt.

516
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,802
I don't like to think of you
Christmassing in a hotel.

517
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:14,037
Why don't you come here?
You're very welcome.

518
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,807
Oh, no.

519
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,643
You don't want a couple of Yankees
rampaging all over your house.

520
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:22,746
Well, I'd speak to Warnie,
of course, but...

521
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,382
Why don't we go inside?

522
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,187
Speaking for myself,
I'd welcome the company.

523
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:33,257
Somehow, Christmas makes more 
sense when there are children around.

524
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,494
I suppose we
ought to get a tree.

525
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,763
What I really resent is the
presumption of good will.

526
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:43,700
I feel no good will towards my 
fellow man, whatever. I feel ill will.

527
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,336
It'll be different this year, of course.
More cheerful, I've no doubt.

528
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:47,371
What's that, Warnie?

529
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:47,371
A festive season.

530
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:52,910
I'm afraid Christmas, as I 
remember it, is rather a lost cause.

531
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,511
Exactly, it's because
we've lost the magic.

532
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,046
No more blasted magic.

533
00:31:56,048 --> 00:32:00,083
Well, you tell people it's about 
taking care of the poor and needy,

534
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,252
and naturally, they don't 
even listen, do they?

535
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,554
The poor and needy do 
come into it, you know.

536
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:07,557
No room at the inn, remember?
For mother and child?

537
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,093
Jack's invited them 
to stay with us.

538
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,662
Who?

539
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,997
Mother and child.

540
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,806
Mrs. Gresham and her son.
They're spending Christmas with us.

541
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,544
Well, Jack, you have 
succeeded in surprising me.

542
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,346
Who is Mrs. Gresham?

543
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,816
Well, she's just a friend.
An American.

544
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,885
A writer.

545
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,123
People do have guests for 
Christmas, don't they?

546
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,266
<i>Next train arriving</i>
<i>at platform two.</i>

547
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:51,134
Hello, Jack. Happy Christmas.

548
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,235
Thanks.

549
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:54,171
Mind your bags please. 
Thank you.

550
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,507
Oxford. Oxford Station.

551
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,775
Mind your bags, please.
Thank you.

552
00:32:58,777 --> 00:32:59,876
Oxford.

553
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,414
This is Oxford Station.

554
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,651
<i>The train now standing at</i>
<i>platform three is the 357.</i>

555
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,252
<i>Platform three.</i>

556
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,857
Nice talking to you. Have a good 
trip and a merry Christmas.

557
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,092
And the same to you, too.

558
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:16,493
Bye-bye.

559
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,429
Here, mum. I can do it.

560
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,098
Are you sure it's not too heavy?

561
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,934
Mum, why did those people
sing so loud in the train?

562
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:28,372
Because it was
Christmas cheer, get it?

563
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:29,439
Hello.

564
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,841
I didn't know you were...

565
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,676
Look who's here, Douglas.

566
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,779
Did you have a good 
journey, Douglas?

567
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:36,847
Yeah.

568
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,115
Welcome back to Oxford.

569
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:39,149
Thanks.

570
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,350
We're glad you could come.

571
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,852
Yeah.

572
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,553
It's up this way.

573
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,761
Douglas, here.

574
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,634
And Joy...

575
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,471
You are here.

576
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,781
And bathroom here.

577
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,485
Well, that's that, then.

578
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:16,586
It's good.

579
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:17,821
Good.

580
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,489
Good. We'll leave you to settle in.

581
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,590
Great.

582
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,159
Won't you come
with me, Douglas?

583
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,065
What do you think next, 
Warnie? A nice cup of tea?

584
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:30,367
You can't go too far wrong
with a cup of tea.

585
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,501
Joy?

586
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,737
Thank you.

587
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,172
By the way, the college president

588
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:38,108
is hosting his annual Christmas
party this evening.

589
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,342
And I'm afraid I'm more or less

590
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:41,011
obliged to put in an appearance.

591
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,946
I don't suppose you'd wish 
to come with me, would you?

592
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,850
With Douglas?

593
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:49,086
Douglas, would you...

594
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,221
Thanks.

595
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,190
You know, Jack, that's all right.

596
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:55,725
I could use an early night.
You go on without us.

597
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,694
Well, that's a pity. I thought 
you'd rather enjoy it.

598
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:00,630
We could always ask Mrs. Young.
We won't be so very late.

599
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,101
I'll be okay.

600
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,939
No, I'm being thoughtless.
You've only just arrived.

601
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,975
Warnie?

602
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,410
Thank you, Jack.

603
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:15,212
Do you have your 
hot-water bottle?

604
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:17,781
Here it is with its 
very dainty cover.

605
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,951
All right, keep it close to you.

606
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,453
Why do you think
they don't heat the house?

607
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,123
I don't know.

608
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,426
It's such a strange country.

609
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,461
But I think the natives are friendly.

610
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,729
All right.

611
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:35,365
So you'll finish your chapter
and say your prayers? Okay.

612
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:42,005
Oh! You have a big, big kiss
on your cheek. Good night.

613
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,674
Good night.

614
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:50,947
Good evening, Major Lewis.

615
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,082
Good evening, Robert.

616
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,116
Mr. Lewis.

617
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,818
'Evening, Robert.

618
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,056
So?

619
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,504
Good evening.

620
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,711
Come and meet
the college president.

621
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,285
This is the college president.

622
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:29,719
Where on Earth
did he find her?

623
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:31,321
She wrote to him.

624
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:32,889
A pen-pal?

625
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,729
Is this your first trip to 
England, Mrs. Gresham?

626
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,498
Yeah, it's my first.

627
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,967
But I was wanting
to come for a long time.

628
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,735
What brings you to 
England, Mrs. Gresham?

629
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:49,406
I'm working on a book, so I was 
hoping to find a publisher over here.

630
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,575
Christopher, there you are.

631
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,377
Yes, Jack, here I am.

632
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,814
Please, let me introduce
you to Mrs. Joy Gresham.

633
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:58,882
Professor Christopher Riley.

634
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,150
Professor Riley.

635
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:01,384
How do you do?

636
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,719
Pleasure.

637
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,991
What success have you
had with your book?

638
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:10,660
Well, to be honest,
it's not ready to be seen yet.

639
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,530
You mustn't let that stop 
you, Mrs. Gresham.

640
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,265
It doesn't stop, Jack.

641
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,167
I'm sorry?

642
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:20,070
I am right in assuming you are 
from the United States of America?

643
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,504
Yes, I am.

644
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:24,507
Then perhaps you can satisfy 
my curiosity on a related matter.

645
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,176
I had always understood Americans

646
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:27,877
to be hard-riding, tough-talking,

647
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:29,412
no-nonsense sort of people.

648
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:33,683
Yet, Jack tells me his children's 
stories sell very well there.

649
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,685
Who can be buying them?

650
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:39,956
Well, professor Riley, we're 
not all cowboys, you know?

651
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,092
Have you read any of Jack's
children's books?

652
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:45,528
Jack has read 
extracts aloud to me.

653
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,530
It is one of his
tests of friendship.

654
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:50,400
Well, I think
they're rather magical.

655
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:53,203
Congratulations, Jack.
You seem to have found a soul mate.

656
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:55,605
I thought you believed that we 
didn't have souls, Christopher.

657
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,576
Well, yes, now,
I regard the soul

658
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:02,045
as an essentially
feminine accessory.

659
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:05,815
Anima, quite different
from animus, the male variant.

660
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,218
This is how I explain the otherwise

661
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,453
puzzling difference
between the sexes.

662
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,089
Where men have intellect,

663
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:15,825
women have soul.

664
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,895
As you say, Professor Riley,
I'm from the United States,

665
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:21,498
and different cultures
have different modes of discourse.

666
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,966
I need a little guidance here.

667
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:26,336
Are you trying to be offensive or
just merely stupid?

668
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,574
Let me introduce you
to some friends of mine.

669
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:32,976
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

670
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,640
Hello.

671
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,780
It stood in our nursery
when we were children.

672
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:19,449
If you don't need it anymore,
you should throw it away.

673
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,919
Well, I'm not very good at throwing
things away, as you can see.

674
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,357
We don't have an attic at home.

675
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,192
No?

676
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:31,694
You wish you were
at home, don't you?

677
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:34,330
We always have a turkey
for Christmas at home.

678
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,434
Well, we'll have Turkey here, too.

679
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,035
With cranberry sauce?

680
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,437
Ah!

681
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,539
My dad loves cranberry sauce.

682
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:43,807
Does he?

683
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:44,407
And snow.

684
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,347
Who do you look like most, Douglas,
your mother or your father?

685
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,952
This is my mum, and this is my dad.

686
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:02,225
But my dad's kind 
of noisy, and I'm not.

687
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,961
Noisy, in which way?

688
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,231
Like shouting.

689
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,867
I hate shouting.

690
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,836
And me, too.

691
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:19,042
I knew it was just an old wardrobe.

692
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,919
Mrs. Young, we wouldn't happen to

693
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:32,589
have any cranberry 
sauce, would we?

694
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:33,990
- Cranberry sauce?
- Yes.

695
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,925
What's that?

696
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:40,363
Well, my guess is, it's a sauce 
made from Cranberries.

697
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,967
Well, Mr. Lewis, 
if you can find me

698
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,869
some Cranberries, 
I'll sauce them.

699
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,046
Well, I think Mrs. Young
has done us proud, Warnie.

700
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:59,015
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.

701
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,185
Happy Christmas.

702
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,453
Happy Christmas.

703
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:06,189
We ought to raise a glass
to your husband, Joy.

704
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,657
Sure, here's to bill.

705
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:08,958
To bill.

706
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,126
Bill.

707
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,128
Can we telephone to America?

708
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,696
Yes, I believe so.
Do you want to?

709
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,398
That's all right.
We'll be home before long.

710
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,300
You're very welcome if you want.

711
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,002
I do want.

712
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:21,004
It's very expensive, Douglas.

713
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:22,839
Oh, come on. I don't mind.

714
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,574
He's just excited
by the novelty of it.

715
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:26,609
I am not.
I want to talk to dad.

716
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,445
Well, you can't,
and that's that.

717
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:36,753
Beastly things, telephones.

718
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:38,655
Ring, ring, ring.
Stop what you're doing.

719
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:41,157
Get up. Hurry, hurry.
Ring, ring, ring.

720
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,494
No manners at all, huh?

721
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,838
- All well?
- All well.

722
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,175
Douglas never makes a 
fuss about going to bed.

723
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:01,844
It appears he never makes
a fuss about anything,

724
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:03,980
except telephones, perhaps.

725
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,683
Right. May I?

726
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,284
Yes, of course.

727
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:12,221
Warnie's taken
himself off to bed, too.

728
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:16,292
Sometimes he overdoes it 
a little. I expect you noticed.

729
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:17,427
Yes.

730
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,862
I know the signs.

731
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:21,998
There are signs, are there?

732
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,033
Poor old Warnie.

733
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,144
You know, don't you?

734
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:37,880
Know what?

735
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:40,883
Well, you must not think
I'm much of a mother,

736
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:44,253
not letting her son call 
his father on Christmas day.

737
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,556
Oh, that. That's none of my...

738
00:43:46,558 --> 00:43:48,391
It just doesn't...
It's not...

739
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,229
It isn't what it looks 
like. That's all.

740
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:54,430
I see.

741
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:55,898
And thank you for not asking.

742
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,801
Not asking what?

743
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,136
"What's this woman doing chasing

744
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,138
"all over England 
without her husband?"

745
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,173
Oh, that.

746
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,213
I ran away.

747
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,017
It's always a mistake, isn't it?

748
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:16,519
I mean, you have to face
things in the end.

749
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,994
I left home because Bill fell 
in love with another woman.

750
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,598
He takes the romantic view.

751
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,800
If you love someone, you 
marry them. I'm number two.

752
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:34,337
He wants me to give him a divorce
so he can marry number three.

753
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,741
I see.

754
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,682
Bill's an alcoholic.

755
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,353
He's compulsively unfaithful.

756
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:54,223
And he's sometimes violent, and 
I guess I haven't loved him for years.

757
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,000
He's violent?

758
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,632
Only when he's drunk and he 
doesn't really know what he's doing.

759
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:05,902
It's just that he's worn me out.
It's the truth of it.

760
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,940
Joy, look, if there's
anything I can do...

761
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,411
There is.

762
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,815
You'll be my friend.

763
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,417
I hope I'm that already.

764
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,759
In you get, young man.

765
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,195
I'll take that for you, sir.

766
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:34,764
Well, goodbye, Warnie.
Thanks for putting up with us.

767
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:37,066
Not at all. We shall miss you.

768
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,075
- Goodbye, Joy.
- Jack.

769
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,232
So, they sail back tomorrow.

770
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:10,366
Yes.

771
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,708
<i>I'm not sure that God particularly</i>
<i>wants us to be happy.</i>

772
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,644
I think he wants us to be 
able to love and be loved.

773
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,448
He wants us to grow up.

774
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:32,822
We think our childish toys
bring us all the happiness there is

775
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:35,691
and our nursery is
the whole wide world.

776
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,427
But something...

777
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:42,231
Something must drive
us out of the nursery

778
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:45,168
to the world of others,

779
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,804
and that something is suffering.

780
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,028
<i>You miss her, don't you?</i>

781
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,367
Well, things are
quieter now, aren't they?

782
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:19,602
Yeah.

783
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:22,305
I'm not much of a talker.

784
00:47:22,307 --> 00:47:23,840
One of your many virtues, Warnie.

785
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,276
Is she coming back?

786
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:28,511
No, no.

787
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,389
Thank you.

788
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,358
Thank you so much, Mr. Lewis.

789
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,459
What's your name?

790
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:44,527
James, sir.

791
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:50,132
James.

792
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,137
Would you sign
my book for me, please?

793
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:56,239
Yes.

794
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,144
Thank you.

795
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,815
Lovely. Thanks so much.

796
00:48:05,817 --> 00:48:07,216
Thank you.

797
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:13,055
I've always found this
a trying time of the year.

798
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:16,225
Trying? To do what, Jack?

799
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:22,298
The leaves not yet out.
Mud everywhere you go.

800
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,334
Frosty mornings gone.

801
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:28,771
Sunny mornings not yet come.

802
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:31,841
Give me blizzards and 
frozen pipes, but not this,

803
00:48:31,843 --> 00:48:33,943
nothing time.

804
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,411
Not this,

805
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,147
waiting room of the world.

806
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:46,255
Tell me something, Christopher.
How shall I put this?

807
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,027
Would you say you were content?

808
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:55,164
I am as I am.
The world is as it is.

809
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,136
My contentment or otherwise 
has very little to do with it.

810
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,308
Don't you ever feel 
a sense of waste?

811
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:08,444
Of course.

812
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,283
Good evening.

813
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,872
I hope you don't mind.
May I come in?

814
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,642
Yeah.

815
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,957
I happened to be in
Blackwell's the other day,

816
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:56,892
and I saw you borrow a book.

817
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,495
Steal. I stole it.

818
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,831
Most of these books are stolen.

819
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,766
Why not? They're written to 
be read. At least I read them,

820
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:06,002
which is more than 
most people do.

821
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,873
So you read differently
to the rest of us, do you?

822
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,842
Yes, I do.

823
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,312
I read at night so nothing breaks

824
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:18,547
my concentration. 
All night, sometimes.

825
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:26,455
When I start a new book,
my hands are shaking.

826
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:28,057
Me eyes are jumping ahead.

827
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:32,194
Does he feel the way I felt?
Does he see what I've seen?

828
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,800
You know, me father used to say...
He's a teacher like you.

829
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:41,771
Well, not like you.
He's only a village schoolmaster.

830
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,343
What was it your
father used to say?

831
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,449
"We read to know
we're not alone."

832
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,757
Would it help if I
made you a small loan?

833
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,994
Yes, I expect it would
if I wanted to be helped.

834
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,431
I see. Goodbye.

835
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,505
You see, we are
like blocks of stone,

836
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:20,276
out of which the sculptor
carves the forms of men.

837
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:25,347
The blows of his chisel,
which hurt us so much,

838
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:27,416
are what make us perfect.

839
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,921
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

840
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,660
Mr. Lewis, what can I say?

841
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,700
Mr. Lewis, I don't 
want to bother you.

842
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:46,335
Congratulations.

843
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:49,572
Wonderful.

844
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:51,040
Mr. Lewis, I'm from Ohio.

845
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:53,175
Ohio? Oh, yes. How nice.

846
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,545
Mr. Lewis, you will 
join us, won't you?

847
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:57,613
Yes.

848
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:00,149
Do. Thank you. Thank you.

849
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:01,250
Thank you.

850
00:52:01,252 --> 00:52:02,952
Thank you so much.

851
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:10,993
Mr. Lewis, you were marvelous.

852
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,061
Thank you.

853
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,063
Hello, Jack.

854
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,233
What are you doing here?

855
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:19,401
Well,
I came to hear your talk.

856
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:20,736
Oh, yes, but...

857
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:22,238
What am I doing in London?

858
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,773
Well, Douglas and I live here now.

859
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:26,075
Really?

860
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:29,011
What did I do with Bill?
We're divorced.

861
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:31,313
But it's going to work out
better for all of us.

862
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,584
Yes. Why didn't you write?

863
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,587
What for? To ask permission?

864
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:39,755
No, no.

865
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,357
Do you mind?

866
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,359
Me? No, why should I mind?

867
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:45,928
So it's all all right, then?

868
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:46,996
Yes, yes.

869
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:52,201
But, really, I'm very...

870
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,136
Very surprised to
see you, you know?

871
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:57,273
Well, I wasn't dead.
I was just in America.

872
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,108
Well, of course. Yes.

873
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,611
Yes, but you see, I...

874
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,848
I've been thinking about you.

875
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,449
Yes, I've been thinking about you.

876
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,285
Can I be of any assistance?

877
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,854
No, it's all right.
I'm just talking to my friend.

878
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:16,859
Yes, I was thinking about you

879
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:19,962
and, suddenly, there you were.

880
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:22,965
No, here I am.
It's present tense.

881
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:24,633
Present and tense.

882
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,502
I'm very sorry, 
but the committee

883
00:53:26,504 --> 00:53:28,337
is waiting to entertain Mr. Lewis.

884
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:31,240
It's all right. I'll be with you 
in a moment. Thank you.

885
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,878
So, do let me know
where you are, Joy.

886
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:39,882
Sure.

887
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,718
Good. Bye.

888
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,927
I do hope I did the right thing.
We're just through here.

889
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:04,273
So, she's settled here
for good, has she?

890
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,242
For the foreseeable future.

891
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,210
With the boy?

892
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:09,345
Yes.

893
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,615
Will you be seeing much of her?

894
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,684
Not much, I shouldn't think.

895
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:18,754
I may look in again
when I'm next in London.

896
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,477
It's very sweet of you to 
come and see me again, Jack.

897
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:42,711
I know how busy you are.

898
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,146
No, not at all.

899
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:45,814
I look forward to
my outings to London.

900
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:46,982
Yeah.

901
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:48,884
You must come and
visit us in Oxford.

902
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:50,052
Would you like some Sherry?

903
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,887
- Oh, yes.
- I'm having some.

904
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:55,157
Yes, maybe as soon as
Douglas' school term ends.

905
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,160
- There you go.
- Thank you.

906
00:54:58,162 --> 00:54:59,395
Cheers.

907
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,899
I would like to see Warnie again.

908
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:06,168
You can just move Douglas'
puzzle out of the way.

909
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,236
All right.

910
00:55:07,238 --> 00:55:08,570
Do remember me to Warnie.

911
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:08,570
Yes.

912
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:12,141
Tell him I promise
I won't turn into a nuisance.

913
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,477
Why should you
turn into a nuisance?

914
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:18,080
Well, Jack, I don't have to explain.

915
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:19,648
Explain what?

916
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,951
Now, why did you
look at me like that?

917
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:24,019
Like what?

918
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,120
As if I'm lying to you.

919
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:27,189
Why should I lie to you?
I mean what I say.

920
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:31,427
No, I know. It's just that you
don't say it all, do you?

921
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:34,763
Well, one can't say it all.
It would take too long.

922
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,267
Did you finish your chapter?

923
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:39,335
Almost.

924
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:42,604
Not yet.

925
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:44,473
All right, just a little bit longer.

926
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:46,108
Just till your hair dries.

927
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,376
Okay. 'Night, Jack.

928
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:48,610
Good night, Douglas.

929
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,512
Wait, I want a kiss.

930
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,118
Night-night.

931
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,953
- Good night, mum.
- Sweet dreams.

932
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,390
I'm going to check the supper.

933
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:15,804
What sort of things
do you want me to say?

934
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:19,074
Well, Jack, I want to remain
friends with you,

935
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:22,177
so I need to know if there's anything
that makes that hard for you.

936
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,012
I see.

937
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,748
We might as well
know where we are.

938
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,318
You never can really tell what's

939
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,253
going on between people,
can you?

940
00:56:31,255 --> 00:56:33,489
People jump to conclusions.

941
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:34,823
Sometimes it
makes me quite angry

942
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,492
the way people
aren't allowed to be...

943
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,193
- What?
- You know, just friends.

944
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:39,495
What, like us, you mean.

945
00:56:39,497 --> 00:56:40,829
Like us.

946
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:44,032
I don't mean to say that 
friendship is a small thing.

947
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,101
As a matter of fact,
I rate it as

948
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:48,170
one of this life's
most precious gifts.

949
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:49,338
But?

950
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,507
But it shouldn't be

951
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:54,176
turned into a watered-down 
version of something that it's not.

952
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,945
- Such as?
- Such as...

953
00:56:56,947 --> 00:57:01,350
Well, to give you
an example, romantic love.

954
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:04,186
That's not to say that 
friendship isn't, in its way...

955
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:05,387
A kind of love.

956
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,689
A kind of love. See? 
I knew you'd understand.

957
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:10,192
I understand more
than that, Jack.

958
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:12,194
- Could you open this?
- Yeah.

959
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,566
You're a bachelor,
and I'm a divorced woman.

960
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:18,901
Now, some people

961
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:22,037
would imagine that you have 
romantic intentions towards me.

962
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:25,741
You have no such intentions.
You want that out in the open

963
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:28,911
because you care about me,
and you don't want me to be hurt.

964
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:31,380
Have I understood you correctly?

965
00:57:31,382 --> 00:57:34,550
I don't know what to say.

966
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:36,385
You don't have to say anything.

967
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:38,153
I just said it.
Wasn't so hard, was it?

968
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:41,056
Well, I'm just not used 
to this... Whatever it is.

969
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:42,758
Naming names, that's all.

970
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,460
Yes.

971
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:49,064
Now you don't have to be 
afraid of me anymore, do you?

972
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:51,733
Good Lord, I was never
afraid of you. You...

973
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:57,406
Why are you looking...
I was never afraid of you. Why look?

974
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:02,077
Jack, I really am

975
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,980
very thankful for everything
you've done for me.

976
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:10,285
I'm sure there are
far more ways I...

977
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:14,022
Substantial ways I can be of help 
that you're not telling me about.

978
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:15,958
I don't want to exhaust
your good will.

979
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,093
Well, there's no fear of that.

980
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:23,799
Well, there is something, which 
would help me enormously.

981
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:29,137
I find it... oh, Jack.
This is very hard for me.

982
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:33,041
If it's too much for you, you would 
just say no, wouldn't you? Just no.

983
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,844
I mean, no guilt,
no evasion, no running away?

984
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,782
Yes, I think I can
just about manage that.

985
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:05,040
Something I ought 
to tell you, Warnie.

986
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,808
Mmm-hmm.

987
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,043
Yeah.

988
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:09,945
Um...

989
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,118
I've agreed to marry Joy.

990
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,593
You have?

991
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:28,230
Mmm-hmm.
Seemed the right thing to do.

992
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,200
It did?

993
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:35,837
Yes, there's nothing 
to worry about.

994
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:39,408
See, what I've agreed to do is 
extend my British citizenship to her,

995
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,843
so that she can go 
on living in England.

996
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:43,545
By marrying her?

997
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:45,614
Yeah, only technically.

998
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,251
You're marrying Joy technically?

999
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,853
A true marriage

1000
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:56,258
is a declaration before God, not 
before some government official.

1001
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,726
And Joy will keep her own name

1002
00:59:57,728 --> 01:00:00,262
and we'll all go on
living exactly as before.

1003
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:07,102
Before you are joined in 
matrimony, I have to remind you

1004
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,204
of the solemn and
binding character

1005
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:11,139
of the vows you
are about to make.

1006
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:15,877
Now, Mr. Lewis,
if you'll repeat after me.

1007
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:18,547
"I call upon these persons
here present..."

1008
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:20,882
I call upon these
persons here present...

1009
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:23,752
"...to witness that I,
Clive Staples Lewis..."

1010
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:26,388
...to witness that I,
Clive Staples Lewis...

1011
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,457
"...do take thee,
Helen Joy Gresham..."

1012
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:30,459
...do take thee,
Helen Joy Gresham...

1013
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,260
"...to be my lawful,
wedded wife."

1014
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:34,730
...to be my lawful,
wedded wife.

1015
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:37,766
Joy Gresham,
if you'll repeat after me.

1016
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:40,068
"I call upon these persons
here present..."

1017
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,738
I call upon these
persons here present...

1018
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,073
"...to witness that I,
Helen Joy Gresham..."

1019
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:47,576
...to witness that I,
Helen Joy Gresham...

1020
01:00:47,578 --> 01:00:50,012
"...do take thee,
Clive Staples Lewis..."

1021
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:52,581
...do take thee,
Clive Staples Lewis...

1022
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:54,349
"...to be my lawful,
wedded husband."

1023
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:56,818
...to be my lawful,
wedded husband.

1024
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,421
Do we have a ring?

1025
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,623
- No.
- No.

1026
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:02,891
No.

1027
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:07,329
- Well, that's that.
- All right, well.

1028
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,097
- Good luck.
- Can I buy you both a drink?

1029
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:12,100
Sorry, Joy, I simply have to
catch the 12:22.

1030
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:13,268
Well then, off you go, Jack.

1031
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,369
Bye, Warnie.

1032
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,338
- Bye, Jack.
- Bye, Joy.

1033
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,376
I would be most grateful
for that drink, Joy.

1034
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,445
That's awfully
kind of you, Warnie.

1035
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:25,047
I think I saw a pub
just down the road.

1036
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:26,114
Shall we risk it?

1037
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:27,883
All right.

1038
01:01:27,885 --> 01:01:28,950
- All right?
- Yeah.

1039
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:30,018
Go.

1040
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,386
Here we go.
Yeah, that's it.

1041
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,729
Well, that was quite
an unusual experience.

1042
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:43,699
Yes, you must forgive Jack.

1043
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:47,803
Well, I'm getting
to know him a little by now.

1044
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:50,038
I think I understand
him better.

1045
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,040
Anyway, I'm very
grateful to him.

1046
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:54,376
Nobody is
to know, he tells me.

1047
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,645
Well, actually
what he said was,

1048
01:01:56,647 --> 01:01:58,814
"it will be as if
it never happened."

1049
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:05,520
A great mistake, Jack.
You'll live to regret it.

1050
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:07,155
Regret what, Chris?

1051
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:10,025
Staying in this godforsaken 
place all summer.

1052
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:11,593
The day after encaenia,
I'm off.

1053
01:02:11,595 --> 01:02:13,161
Where, Chris?

1054
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:14,730
Tuscany, where else?

1055
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:17,432
Where else, indeed. Could I 
have some cheese, Jeremy?

1056
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:20,068
We're going to
the Loire, camping.

1057
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,838
Camping?

1058
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,539
I think I'll bring
a guest this year.

1059
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:25,741
Do, by all means.

1060
01:02:25,743 --> 01:02:26,908
When Laura was alive,

1061
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,244
we once took the 
grandchildren camping.

1062
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,046
Bring a guest, Jack?

1063
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:32,581
Yes, encaenia.

1064
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:37,419
Take my tip, Rupert. Sleep 
outside the tent, and smoke a cigar.

1065
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,287
- Whatever for?
- Mosquitoes.

1066
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:42,224
You've met her, Joy Gresham.

1067
01:02:42,226 --> 01:02:43,358
Yes. Yes, quite.

1068
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,626
Not the American?

1069
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,362
Yes, the American.

1070
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:49,030
Is she back in Oxford?

1071
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:50,098
Thank you.

1072
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,501
No, no.
No, she's in London.

1073
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,571
She wants to see
the pageant of learning.

1074
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,525
I feel distinctly
underdressed.

1075
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:26,294
This is just a sort
of uniform really.

1076
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,530
This is Jack's party frock.

1077
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:35,203
Jack, come here. Come here.

1078
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:37,873
What?

1079
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,241
Just a little something...

1080
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:41,877
What is that? What is it?

1081
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:43,445
Yeah, I got it. It's fine.

1082
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:46,248
If you feel like a stroll...

1083
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,315
Are these two places free?

1084
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:48,383
Yes, please do.

1085
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:50,318
Claude, let me
give you a hand.

1086
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,220
Here we go.

1087
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,321
She's living in London now?

1088
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:54,489
Yes.

1089
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:55,657
With her husband?

1090
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,759
No, they're divorced.

1091
01:04:57,761 --> 01:05:00,528
Why did I have a feeling
you were going to say that?

1092
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,664
- Hello, Warnie.
- Hello.

1093
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,199
Are you all right?

1094
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:06,935
I'm just a little exhausted.
Would it be all right if we sat down?

1095
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:10,305
Yes. You haven't seen my 
rooms yet. Let me show you.

1096
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:12,941
You tired?

1097
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,677
Would you like coffee?

1098
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:17,178
- Yes.
- Nescafe?

1099
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,980
Sure.

1100
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,945
There, that's better.
Much better.

1101
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,650
You should change those shoes.

1102
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:57,886
I don't want to talk about that.

1103
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:00,956
I'm not going to
stay long, either.

1104
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,925
For all I know, I'm not even
allowed to be here.

1105
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:05,660
Female guests are permitted

1106
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:07,329
between 10:00 A.M.
and 8:00 P.M.

1107
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:09,998
We're legal.

1108
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:17,005
Jack, don't you sometimes
just bust to share the joke?

1109
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,174
What joke?

1110
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,109
Here's your friends,
thinking we're unmarried

1111
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:22,844
and up to all
sorts of wickedness.

1112
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:26,081
When all along we're married
and up to nothing at all.

1113
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,151
Which friends?

1114
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:33,154
God, you really can be
hard work sometimes.

1115
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:44,232
So, what do you do here?
Think great thoughts?

1116
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:46,968
Teach, mainly.

1117
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,503
What do they do?

1118
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,705
Sit at your feet and 
gaze up at you in awe?

1119
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:52,374
No, not at all.

1120
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,878
I bet they do.

1121
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,515
We have some fine old battles 
in here, I can tell you that.

1122
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,717
Which you win.

1123
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:09,958
It must be quite
a boost for you,

1124
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,861
being older and wiser
than all of them.

1125
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:17,032
Not to mention your readers.

1126
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:19,134
What?

1127
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:23,505
Your readers and that 
gang of friends of yours.

1128
01:07:23,507 --> 01:07:26,741
All very well-trained
not to play out of bounds.

1129
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:28,309
What are you talking about?

1130
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:29,844
Of course, there's Warnie.

1131
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:31,980
Not much competition there.

1132
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:33,481
That's nonsense.

1133
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:35,350
And what about
Christopher Riley?

1134
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:37,752
He never lets me get away
with anything, you know that.

1135
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:42,657
Except doubt and fear 
and pain and terror.

1136
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,693
Where does
all that come from?

1137
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,762
I don't know, I've 
only now just seen it,

1138
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:51,966
how you've arranged a life for
yourself where no one can touch you.

1139
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:56,704
Everyone that's close to you
is either younger than you,

1140
01:07:56,706 --> 01:08:00,575
or weaker than you
or under your control.

1141
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:03,044
Why...

1142
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:05,580
Why are you getting at me?
I thought... I thought we were friends.

1143
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:09,684
I don't know that we are friends...

1144
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:12,420
Not the way you
have friends, anyway.

1145
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,355
Sorry, Jack.

1146
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:15,457
I don't understand.

1147
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:18,693
No, I think you do.

1148
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:21,529
You just don't
like it, nor do I.

1149
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,404
Whistler.

1150
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,673
- Three?
- Yeah.

1151
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:06,975
- Bye.
- Bye.

1152
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,648
<i>Go? Go where?</i>

1153
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:15,416
London.

1154
01:09:15,418 --> 01:09:17,685
But, why? Is it money?

1155
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,522
Not really.

1156
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:22,690
One more year,
and you'd have your degree.

1157
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:25,193
Yeah, then what?
Teach like you?

1158
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:29,864
I wonder what it is
everyone wants from me.

1159
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,935
You know, that's the first 
question I've ever heard you ask

1160
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:36,838
that sounds like
you don't know the answer.

1161
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,140
Is that good?
Is that what you want?

1162
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:41,676
Ignorance? Confusion?

1163
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,645
Look, I just don't
think I see my way

1164
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:45,547
ahead quite as
clearly as you do.

1165
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:49,284
Shadows.

1166
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:50,351
What?

1167
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,321
It's one of my stories.

1168
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:55,423
"We live in the Shadowlands.

1169
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:59,027
"The sun is always
shining somewhere else.

1170
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:02,530
"Round a bend in the road.
Over the brow of a hill."

1171
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,581
Hello, a London number, please.

1172
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:44,239
Yesterday, a friend of 
mine, a very brave,

1173
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:47,141
good woman,

1174
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:53,748
collapsed in terrible pain.
One minute, she was fit and well,

1175
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,352
the next minute,
she was in agony.

1176
01:10:57,354 --> 01:11:00,054
She is now in hospital,
and this morning

1177
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:04,125
I was told she's
suffering from cancer.

1178
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:06,127
Why?

1179
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,267
See, if you love someone,
you don't want them to suffer.

1180
01:11:12,269 --> 01:11:14,302
You can't bear it.

1181
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:17,138
<i>You want to take their</i>
<i>suffering onto yourself.</i>

1182
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,774
<i>Even I feel like that.</i>

1183
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:22,644
<i>Why doesn't God?</i>

1184
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:27,749
How is she?

1185
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:28,883
Not good.

1186
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,189
I'm so sorry, Jack.

1187
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:39,594
I just want her to be
well again, you see.

1188
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:42,830
Of course you do.
We all do.

1189
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,002
What a dangerous world
we live in, Warnie.

1190
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:50,938
You've been up all night.
Why don't you get some sleep?

1191
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,241
No, I can't sleep.

1192
01:11:56,246 --> 01:11:59,447
It's all too soon, you see.
I just haven't had time, that's all.

1193
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:01,149
Time for what?

1194
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:03,584
I don't know.

1195
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:06,087
To talk, say things.

1196
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,526
It doesn't take long.

1197
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:14,028
No, I suppose not.

1198
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,733
Whatever it is,
I should just say it.

1199
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:26,507
Yes, you must be right, Warnie,
but it is difficult, you see.

1200
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,344
Yes, I do see that.

1201
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:33,881
Mr. Lewis.

1202
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:35,350
Dr. Craig, this is
my brother, Warnie.

1203
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:37,819
How do you do?
Your wife.

1204
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:39,620
How is she?
Any change?

1205
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:44,659
We've made her
as comfortable as we can,

1206
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:47,028
otherwise, there's nothing
further to report.

1207
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:50,198
How much has
she been told?

1208
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:54,268
She's been told that the cancer
has eaten away her left femur.

1209
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,404
Oh, no.

1210
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:58,673
She knows it's serious.

1211
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:00,541
The thigh bone snapped
like a frozen twig.

1212
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:02,343
I see.

1213
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:03,745
Can anything be done?

1214
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:07,382
She's dying, Warnie.

1215
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:10,718
That's putting it more starkly
than I would choose, Mr. Lewis.

1216
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,887
No, but it's true,
isn't it?

1217
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,591
The cancer is very advanced.

1218
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:26,934
Joy?

1219
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,404
Jack?

1220
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:31,305
Don't talk if it hurts.

1221
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,510
Where's Douglas?

1222
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:37,245
He's staying with
us for the moment.

1223
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:39,013
I'll bring him over
to see you when...

1224
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:40,415
When you're up to it.

1225
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:42,183
Thank you.

1226
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,120
Do you have any water?

1227
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:48,089
Mmm-hmm.

1228
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,095
Were you here to
visit me before?

1229
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:56,998
A couple of times, yes.

1230
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,500
I thought so.

1231
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:18,085
Sorry, Jack. I didn't mean
to cause you all this bother.

1232
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:22,557
Don't talk nonsense. You're 
the one that's having the bother.

1233
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:28,229
What I mean is, you don't 
have to take care of me.

1234
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:33,401
Well...

1235
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,304
Who do you expect
to take care of you?

1236
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:42,477
You know what
I'm trying to say.

1237
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:45,012
But who else should 
take care of you, but me?

1238
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:46,681
You're my wife.

1239
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:51,319
Technically.

1240
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,988
Then I shall look
after you technically.

1241
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:06,667
Jack, I have to know how 
bad it is. They won't tell me.

1242
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:09,537
Well, that's because
they're not sure themselves.

1243
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,473
Please, Jack.

1244
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:14,075
I don't know any
more than they do.

1245
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,779
Before Douglas gets here,
I need to know.

1246
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:26,554
They say you're going to die.

1247
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:32,226
Yes. Thank you.

1248
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:44,171
What do you say, Jack?
I'm a Jew.

1249
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:46,974
I'm divorced. I'm broke.

1250
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:50,444
And I'm dying of cancer.
Do you think I get a discount?

1251
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,920
Oh, Joy.

1252
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,232
Do you know
something, Jack?

1253
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:12,733
Hmm?

1254
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,804
You seem different.

1255
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,174
You look at me properly now.

1256
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:23,277
Didn't I before?

1257
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,914
Not properly.

1258
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,422
I don't want to lose you, Joy.

1259
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,026
I don't want to be lost.

1260
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:52,073
Nurse. Nurse!

1261
01:16:52,075 --> 01:16:53,307
Nurse!

1262
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:00,815
Is this pain really necessary?

1263
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,217
I'll fetch the doctor.

1264
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:04,285
Good.

1265
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:18,399
There we are. We'll... we'll 
make another one tomorrow.

1266
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,569
Now it's lights out?

1267
01:17:21,571 --> 01:17:23,070
No, I read in bed.

1268
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:25,306
Got your book?

1269
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:26,407
Here.

1270
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:27,742
How long are you
allowed to read?

1271
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:29,076
One chapter.

1272
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:30,811
One chapter then, huh?

1273
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:34,081
I want to be awake
when Jack gets back.

1274
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,950
Well, that shouldn't
be long now.

1275
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:37,485
He will say
good night, won't he?

1276
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:39,086
Of course.

1277
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:40,888
- Night-night.
- 'Night.

1278
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:12,253
No change.

1279
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:16,190
I promised Douglas
you'd say good night.

1280
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,097
She's in hospital in London.

1281
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:58,165
Apparently,
he goes up there every day.

1282
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,067
It must have
hit him very hard.

1283
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:03,170
It's thrown him
completely off balance.

1284
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:04,905
A sad business.

1285
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:06,407
Has he said anything to you?

1286
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:08,542
- About her?
- Yeah.

1287
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:10,177
No, nothing.

1288
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:17,985
Oh!

1289
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,861
Jack,
I'm so sorry about all this.

1290
01:19:26,863 --> 01:19:28,662
Yes. Yes, Christopher.
Thank you.

1291
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:38,272
It's all come
too soon, you see.

1292
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:41,142
Her affairs aren't in order, and...

1293
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:45,613
What's going to happen
to Douglas, for example?

1294
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:48,582
I suppose, his father?

1295
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:50,251
No.

1296
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:52,553
No, she wouldn't want that.

1297
01:19:52,555 --> 01:19:56,157
Because he drinks, you know,
and he's an alcoholic.

1298
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:00,127
There must be other relatives.

1299
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:06,634
I mean, it's not as if...

1300
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,404
It's not as if what, Harry?

1301
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:12,973
Well, she's your friend, of course.

1302
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:14,909
But, well...

1303
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:17,978
She's not family.

1304
01:20:20,115 --> 01:20:22,316
She's not my wife?

1305
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,751
No, of course not.

1306
01:20:23,753 --> 01:20:26,353
No, of course not.
It's impossible.

1307
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:28,689
It's unthinkable.

1308
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:35,563
How could Joy be my wife?

1309
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,167
I'd have to love her,
wouldn't I?

1310
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:45,506
I'd have to care more for her

1311
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:48,742
than for anyone else in this world.

1312
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:54,348
I'd have to be suffering
the torments of the damned

1313
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,750
at the prospect of losing her.

1314
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:04,058
I'm sorry, Jack. I didn't know.

1315
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,862
Nor did I, Harry.

1316
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:15,469
It's growing in right here.

1317
01:21:15,471 --> 01:21:18,072
See? I got a new tooth.

1318
01:21:18,074 --> 01:21:20,140
That's great. How 'bout 
that one on the bottom?

1319
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:21,442
Remember?

1320
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,578
Oh, yes.

1321
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:33,554
Better take him home. I'll stay 
a little longer. I'll catch the 8:40.

1322
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:34,788
Right.

1323
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:38,559
May we come in?

1324
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:41,028
Ever had toasted 
teacakes, Douglas?

1325
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:42,529
No.

1326
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:44,665
The secret's in the butter.
You've got to have so much

1327
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,700
that it runs down your finger.

1328
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:48,636
Shall we go and find some?

1329
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:52,506
Put that tooth under your pillow.

1330
01:21:52,508 --> 01:21:54,008
- Okay.
- Okay.

1331
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,843
- See you soon.
- Bye.

1332
01:21:55,845 --> 01:21:57,377
Come on.
The secret's in the butter.

1333
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:58,712
You've got to have lots of butter.

1334
01:21:58,714 --> 01:22:00,614
- See you later.
- Yes.

1335
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,253
Are you staying?

1336
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,955
Yes, for a while.

1337
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:22,703
I want to marry you, Joy.

1338
01:22:22,705 --> 01:22:26,473
I want to marry you
before God and the world.

1339
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:31,779
Make an honest
woman out of me?

1340
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:33,714
No, not you.

1341
01:22:33,716 --> 01:22:35,950
It's me who hasn't been honest.

1342
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:40,120
Look what it takes
to make me see sense.

1343
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:44,124
You think I've overdone it?

1344
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,162
Please don't leave me, Joy.

1345
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,804
You know, Jack,
back where I come from,

1346
01:22:56,806 --> 01:22:59,206
they have this quaint old custom.

1347
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:05,646
Well, when a guy makes up his 
mind to marry a girl, he asks her.

1348
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:08,315
It's called proposing.

1349
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:11,251
It's the same here.

1350
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,088
Did I miss it?

1351
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:31,171
Will you marry this foolish,
frightened old man,

1352
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:36,110
who needs you more 
than he can bear to say...

1353
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:40,180
Who loves you even though 
he hardly knows how?

1354
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:45,686
Just this once.

1355
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:04,071
We don't seem to have
had much time to talk.

1356
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:07,207
I'm okay.

1357
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:09,209
Yeah.

1358
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:12,046
Your mother and I...

1359
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:16,483
Why did we ever have to 
come to this stupid country?

1360
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:18,419
We were all right
where we were.

1361
01:24:18,421 --> 01:24:20,421
I told mum,
but she wouldn't listen.

1362
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:31,432
Does my dad know she's sick?
Did anybody tell him?

1363
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,902
Yes, he's been told.

1364
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:46,413
It's sinking now. I don't care.

1365
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:57,057
I know your mother's
talked to you about...

1366
01:24:57,059 --> 01:24:58,258
Yup.

1367
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:03,697
Would that be
all right with you?

1368
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:04,865
Yup.

1369
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:11,071
It would make me happy, and I 
think it would make her happy, too.

1370
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,642
Okay.

1371
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:26,420
I, Joy, take thee, Jack...

1372
01:25:26,422 --> 01:25:29,456
"...to have and to hold
from this day forward..."

1373
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:32,893
...to have and to hold
from this day forward...

1374
01:25:32,895 --> 01:25:34,461
"...for better, for worse..."

1375
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,630
...for better, for worse...

1376
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,599
"...for richer, for poorer..."

1377
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:40,567
...for richer, for poorer...

1378
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:42,769
"...in sickness and in health..."

1379
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:45,639
...in sickness and in health...

1380
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:48,742
"...to love, cherish, and obey..."

1381
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,745
...to love, cherish, and obey...

1382
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:53,480
"...till death us do part."

1383
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,884
...till death us do part.

1384
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,154
The ring?

1385
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,333
"With this ring, I thee wed."

1386
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:16,236
With this ring, I thee wed.

1387
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:19,273
"With my body, I thee worship."

1388
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:23,010
With my body, I thee worship.

1389
01:26:23,012 --> 01:26:26,346
"And all my worldly 
goods, I thee endow."

1390
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:30,551
And all my worldly goods, I thee endow.

1391
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:46,466
Those whom God hath joined 
together, let no man put asunder.

1392
01:28:36,444 --> 01:28:38,211
Mr. Lewis?

1393
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:40,747
Yes.

1394
01:28:40,749 --> 01:28:41,815
Peter Whistler.

1395
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:44,584
Of course, yes. How are you?

1396
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:46,086
Fine.

1397
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:50,757
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1398
01:28:50,759 --> 01:28:52,359
Funny the way things
work out, isn't it?

1399
01:28:52,361 --> 01:28:54,428
I've not noticed that they do.

1400
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:56,330
You're probably right. Well.

1401
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:01,935
"Fight me, I can take it."

1402
01:29:01,937 --> 01:29:03,203
What?

1403
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:05,439
"Fight me, I can take it," you've...

1404
01:29:05,441 --> 01:29:06,540
Did I say that?

1405
01:29:06,542 --> 01:29:07,607
Yes.

1406
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:09,710
Ah!

1407
01:29:09,712 --> 01:29:12,112
So what are you doing these days?

1408
01:29:12,114 --> 01:29:15,282
Teaching. Feel free 
to give a hollow laugh.

1409
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,453
No, I suspect you're a born teacher.

1410
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,056
I do turn out to be quite good at it.

1411
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:24,124
Good.

1412
01:29:25,993 --> 01:29:27,627
Your father's a teacher,
isn't he?

1413
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,029
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

1414
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:31,531
He died a few months ago.

1415
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,034
I'm sorry.

1416
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:36,603
I loved him very much.

1417
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:41,074
Did he know that?

1418
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:46,246
I think so.

1419
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:48,548
I think he knew.

1420
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:49,716
Yeah.

1421
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:53,320
One has to say things.

1422
01:29:53,322 --> 01:29:56,823
The moment passes,
and then you're alone again.

1423
01:29:56,825 --> 01:29:57,991
Yes.

1424
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:04,231
"We read to know
we're not alone."

1425
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,169
That's what he said, wasn't it, 
your father? I haven't forgotten.

1426
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:11,805
Well.

1427
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:18,412
Jack, what news?

1428
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:19,913
Good news, I think, Harry.

1429
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:21,181
Yes, good news.

1430
01:30:21,183 --> 01:30:22,516
I'm very glad, Jack.

1431
01:30:22,518 --> 01:30:24,184
Thank you, Christopher. 
Thank you.

1432
01:30:24,186 --> 01:30:28,755
Christopher can scoff, but I know 
how hard you've been praying.

1433
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:32,692
And now, God is
answering your prayer.

1434
01:30:32,694 --> 01:30:35,695
That's not why I pray, Harry.
I pray because I can't help myself.

1435
01:30:35,697 --> 01:30:40,066
I pray because I'm helpless.
I pray because the need

1436
01:30:40,068 --> 01:30:43,437
flows out of me all the time,
waking and sleeping.

1437
01:30:45,706 --> 01:30:47,908
It doesn't change God.
It changes me.

1438
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:50,143
He's got very little on his plate.

1439
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:00,220
Doctor, how is she?

1440
01:31:00,222 --> 01:31:02,923
Well, I think you'd 
better see for yourself.

1441
01:31:02,925 --> 01:31:04,257
I'll catch you up, sister.

1442
01:31:04,259 --> 01:31:05,525
Right, sir.

1443
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:13,967
Watch.

1444
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:20,307
Well.

1445
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,143
Can you do more?

1446
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:24,644
All right, come closer.

1447
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:34,221
That's it.

1448
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,357
Oh, dear!

1449
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:39,192
How did I do?

1450
01:31:39,194 --> 01:31:41,261
It's not bad.
That's wonderful.

1451
01:31:41,263 --> 01:31:43,363
Wonderful.
Come sit down.

1452
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:45,932
Wonderful.

1453
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:50,604
So, does she have to stay here?

1454
01:31:50,606 --> 01:31:51,938
I see no reason why.

1455
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:54,474
So long as the
remission continues.

1456
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:56,676
How long is that?

1457
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:59,045
Come on,
you can speak openly.

1458
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:01,481
Could be months, could be weeks.

1459
01:32:01,483 --> 01:32:03,950
Why not years?

1460
01:32:03,952 --> 01:32:08,121
In such an advanced case
that would be unusual.

1461
01:32:08,123 --> 01:32:09,956
Well, we take what we can get.

1462
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:11,024
Right.

1463
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:14,060
How would you like to come home?

1464
01:32:14,062 --> 01:32:15,529
Jack, where's home?

1465
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:19,165
What do you mean, "where's home?"
Oxford. My house. Our house.

1466
01:32:19,167 --> 01:32:23,036
We're married. Don't you remember?
Let's go and take her home.

1467
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:26,406
Good.

1468
01:32:26,408 --> 01:32:29,476
Now, there's no need to worry 
about me, Jack. I'll sort myself out.

1469
01:32:29,478 --> 01:32:31,211
Sort yourself out?
What do you mean?

1470
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:32,979
New digs. No problem.

1471
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:34,147
Do you want to?

1472
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:35,315
It's as you wish, Jack.

1473
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:36,416
I don't.

1474
01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:37,651
Right you are.

1475
01:32:37,653 --> 01:32:39,085
It's settled.

1476
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,242
Douglas?

1477
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,481
There. There.

1478
01:33:13,087 --> 01:33:16,356
Thanks, sweetheart.
Give me a kiss.

1479
01:33:16,358 --> 01:33:17,757
Okay. Good night.

1480
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:18,925
Good night, mum.

1481
01:33:19,527 --> 01:33:20,994
Ready, Jack.

1482
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:29,803
Here we are. Take 
it slowly. That's it.

1483
01:33:31,072 --> 01:33:34,274
All right? That's it, not far.

1484
01:33:34,276 --> 01:33:37,744
Can we just sit down?
I need a lot of pauses.

1485
01:33:37,746 --> 01:33:39,713
- All right.
- All right.

1486
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:46,019
Good. Up we go.

1487
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:50,457
- It's good.
- Right.

1488
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:57,197
Good.

1489
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:05,005
Thank you, my love.

1490
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:08,008
What for?

1491
01:34:09,243 --> 01:34:10,844
For all of it.

1492
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:17,617
I think it's better if I lie down.

1493
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:20,186
Wait. Move slowly. Hold it.

1494
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:23,523
Here you are,
it's more comfortable.

1495
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:27,460
- There.
- Good.

1496
01:34:27,462 --> 01:34:29,229
- All right.
- Good.

1497
01:34:35,102 --> 01:34:37,937
Yes, as I look at this room...

1498
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:40,373
It strikes me, it is a bit 
on the spartan side.

1499
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:44,778
How long has it been your room?

1500
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,946
Twenty-five years.

1501
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:49,215
More, I suppose.

1502
01:34:49,217 --> 01:34:51,051
Have you ever
shared it with anyone?

1503
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:53,853
No.

1504
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:56,022
Feel strange?

1505
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:01,094
Well, I'm not entirely
sure of the procedure.

1506
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:06,166
Well, what do you usually do
when you go to bed, Jack?

1507
01:35:06,168 --> 01:35:08,001
Very much what you'd expect.

1508
01:35:08,003 --> 01:35:10,570
No, tell me. See, you 
come in the door...

1509
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:13,440
Then I draw the curtains.

1510
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:24,517
Then I get out my pajamas.

1511
01:35:24,519 --> 01:35:26,486
From where?

1512
01:35:26,488 --> 01:35:28,088
Under the pillow.

1513
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:30,824
And then what?

1514
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:37,564
Then I hang my clothes
over the chair.

1515
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,935
I clean my teeth, wash...

1516
01:35:44,205 --> 01:35:46,740
Kneel by the bed.

1517
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:50,744
No, first I, turn back the bedclothes,
then I kneel by the bed,

1518
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:54,447
pray, then I get into bed.

1519
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:57,450
Like a little boy.

1520
01:35:57,452 --> 01:35:58,585
Is it?

1521
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:01,488
What next?

1522
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:04,424
Then I go to sleep.

1523
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:08,161
On your back or on your side?

1524
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:11,197
On my side.

1525
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:19,706
Show me.

1526
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,058
Good.

1527
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:42,562
You do everything just the 
way you always do it, Jack.

1528
01:36:42,564 --> 01:36:45,832
When you get to the last bit,
I'll be here, too.

1529
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:48,968
That's the procedure.

1530
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,842
What is the time?
Let's see.

1531
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:32,212
6:00 any minute now.

1532
01:37:32,214 --> 01:37:35,648
Well, is somebody going to ring
a bell or something?

1533
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:39,118
Yes, I believe a lot of people
ring a lot of bells.

1534
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:42,288
First, they sing.

1535
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:44,891
All right?

1536
01:38:42,283 --> 01:38:43,549
Jump! Jump!

1537
01:38:43,551 --> 01:38:46,886
Mad. They're raving
mad, all of them.

1538
01:38:46,888 --> 01:38:48,388
It's known as high spirits.

1539
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:50,089
Jump! Jump! Jump!

1540
01:39:01,535 --> 01:39:03,636
Admit you're
glad I brought you.

1541
01:39:03,638 --> 01:39:08,274
It's pagan. It's vulgar. It's all 
faintly silly, but it works.

1542
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:11,144
Sunrise always works.

1543
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:21,888
You have to hold it down.

1544
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:23,656
So how do you want it to look?
Like that, right?

1545
01:39:23,658 --> 01:39:25,591
- Yeah.
- So describe that.

1546
01:39:25,593 --> 01:39:27,460
- Well,it's got lots of sunlight.
- Hello.

1547
01:39:27,462 --> 01:39:29,228
Then type it. Hi.

1548
01:39:29,230 --> 01:39:30,263
Hello, Douglas.

1549
01:39:30,265 --> 01:39:32,565
Jack, where did you say
the Golden Valley was?

1550
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:34,067
Somewhere in Herefordshire,
I believe.

1551
01:39:34,069 --> 01:39:35,635
Douglas, your tea's ready.

1552
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:38,304
All right, all right. Okay, so 
remember what we talked about,

1553
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:40,073
'cause it's important.
We'll finish this thing.

1554
01:39:40,075 --> 01:39:41,407
- Okay.
- All right.

1555
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:46,312
- Hello.
- Hello.

1556
01:39:48,248 --> 01:39:50,183
Where did you say it was?

1557
01:39:50,185 --> 01:39:51,918
Herefordshire, I believe.

1558
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,754
And do you think it
still looks the same?

1559
01:39:54,756 --> 01:39:56,556
Oh, I very much doubt it.

1560
01:39:58,092 --> 01:40:00,760
You thought it was
heaven, didn't you?

1561
01:40:00,762 --> 01:40:02,829
I was only a child.

1562
01:40:05,966 --> 01:40:08,001
Let's go and look for it, Jack.

1563
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:09,535
Hmm?

1564
01:40:09,537 --> 01:40:11,604
We never had a honeymoon.

1565
01:40:11,606 --> 01:40:13,306
Are you up to traveling?

1566
01:40:13,308 --> 01:40:14,907
It's not so far, is it?

1567
01:40:16,176 --> 01:40:19,512
I don't really know.
Where would we stay?

1568
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:23,716
I don't know.
A small country hotel.

1569
01:40:30,324 --> 01:40:31,457
You happy?

1570
01:40:31,459 --> 01:40:32,692
Yes.

1571
01:40:32,694 --> 01:40:34,627
What kind of happy?

1572
01:40:34,629 --> 01:40:35,862
Just happy.

1573
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:42,668
You know my kind of happy?

1574
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:44,337
How stupid.

1575
01:40:44,339 --> 01:40:46,572
I always forget.
When you ask a question,

1576
01:40:46,574 --> 01:40:50,243
it means you have the answer 
waiting. So go ahead, tell me.

1577
01:40:50,245 --> 01:40:51,811
No.

1578
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:54,080
Come on.

1579
01:40:54,082 --> 01:40:56,916
No, I'm not telling you now.

1580
01:40:56,918 --> 01:41:00,053
What do I have to do?
I have to go to the lecture?

1581
01:41:00,055 --> 01:41:02,155
Yes, buy the book.

1582
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:11,564
Well, it's a hotel,
and it's in the country.

1583
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:29,982
Thank you.

1584
01:41:30,384 --> 01:41:31,517
Thank you.

1585
01:41:31,519 --> 01:41:33,019
Jack.

1586
01:41:33,021 --> 01:41:34,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

1587
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:35,621
Yes.

1588
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,731
Well, will it do?

1589
01:41:45,733 --> 01:41:47,667
It's beautiful, Jack.

1590
01:41:48,869 --> 01:41:51,137
You seem to have
survived the journey.

1591
01:41:51,139 --> 01:41:54,140
Yes, but I could
use a drink.

1592
01:41:54,142 --> 01:41:55,708
Yeah, do they have
room service?

1593
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:57,643
Room service?

1594
01:41:57,645 --> 01:41:59,112
I used to think that room service

1595
01:41:59,114 --> 01:42:01,214
was saying your prayers in bed.

1596
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:03,649
Well, you can order
some prayers if you want.

1597
01:42:03,651 --> 01:42:05,485
I will take a gin and tonic.

1598
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:07,787
What, now?

1599
01:42:07,789 --> 01:42:09,388
Sure, why not?

1600
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:11,858
All right.

1601
01:42:13,060 --> 01:42:14,327
Honey.

1602
01:42:14,928 --> 01:42:16,696
You can use a telephone.

1603
01:42:17,397 --> 01:42:19,899
Where is it? Oh, yes, phone.

1604
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:23,970
Room service.

1605
01:42:27,407 --> 01:42:28,674
Hello?

1606
01:42:30,177 --> 01:42:33,913
Yes, this is Mr.
Lewis in room number...

1607
01:42:33,915 --> 01:42:36,482
I'm sorry. I've forgotten
the number of the room...

1608
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:38,684
I'm already in the room, 
you see.

1609
01:42:38,686 --> 01:42:40,319
Oh, you do. Good.

1610
01:42:42,789 --> 01:42:44,423
Yes, a gin and tonic.

1611
01:42:48,095 --> 01:42:48,094
Gin and tonic.

1612
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:54,400
Two gin and tonics. Two gins 
and tonic, I should say.

1613
01:42:55,636 --> 01:42:58,271
Yes, I'm sorry.
Good. Thank you. Bye.

1614
01:43:00,774 --> 01:43:02,608
You don't like gin.

1615
01:43:03,944 --> 01:43:05,912
I'm afraid I panicked.

1616
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:09,282
Come here.

1617
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:15,388
The Golden Valley runs
along the river Dore.

1618
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:17,957
Here, let me show 
you on the map.

1619
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:22,028
It runs from here to here.

1620
01:43:22,996 --> 01:43:24,297
Why "golden"?

1621
01:43:24,299 --> 01:43:26,065
It's a mistake, really.

1622
01:43:26,067 --> 01:43:29,468
The Welsh for "water" is <i>"dwr"</i>
which sounds like <i>"d'or,"</i>

1623
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:33,906
the French for "golden."
It isn't golden at all. It's wet.

1624
01:43:33,908 --> 01:43:36,709
Where can one get a view of the valley?

1625
01:43:36,711 --> 01:43:38,978
I should go along here,

1626
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:40,880
<i>down to the junction here,</i>

1627
01:43:40,882 --> 01:43:42,815
<i>and turn left up</i>
<i>this little road.</i>

1628
01:43:42,817 --> 01:43:45,084
<i>That'll take you</i>
<i>up into the hills.</i>

1629
01:43:47,488 --> 01:43:49,722
You know, I don't know
why we're doing this.

1630
01:43:49,724 --> 01:43:51,257
Yes, you do.

1631
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:54,660
It probably won't be the same.

1632
01:43:54,662 --> 01:43:56,495
It'll all be changed or spoiled.

1633
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:04,203
Thank you.

1634
01:44:04,205 --> 01:44:05,471
Thank you.

1635
01:44:13,213 --> 01:44:15,881
I think that was it.
Oh, no, I'm wrong.

1636
01:44:15,883 --> 01:44:18,050
The valley runs East-West, 
doesn't it?

1637
01:44:18,052 --> 01:44:19,619
No idea.

1638
01:44:27,427 --> 01:44:29,795
You know we're there
already, of course?

1639
01:44:29,797 --> 01:44:31,430
Where?

1640
01:44:31,432 --> 01:44:32,765
There.

1641
01:44:34,801 --> 01:44:37,436
Oh, there, yes.

1642
01:45:21,915 --> 01:45:23,649
Well, that's it.

1643
01:46:04,157 --> 01:46:05,958
Well, we almost made it.

1644
01:46:23,477 --> 01:46:27,012
No, I don't want to be
somewhere else anymore.

1645
01:46:27,014 --> 01:46:30,549
Not waiting for
anything new to happen.

1646
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:34,387
Not looking around the 
next corner, nor the next hill.

1647
01:46:34,389 --> 01:46:37,456
Here now. That's enough.

1648
01:46:40,026 --> 01:46:42,495
That's your kind
of happy, isn't it?

1649
01:46:42,497 --> 01:46:44,330
Yes. Yes, it is.

1650
01:46:49,369 --> 01:46:51,737
It's not going to last, Jack.

1651
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:59,278
We shouldn't
think about that now.

1652
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,514
Let's not spoil
the time we have together.

1653
01:47:01,516 --> 01:47:03,416
It doesn't spoil it.

1654
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:06,318
It makes it real.

1655
01:47:11,024 --> 01:47:14,827
Let me just say it before this 
rain stops, and we go back.

1656
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:20,933
What is there to say?

1657
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,337
That I'm going to die

1658
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:30,709
and I want to be
with you then, too.

1659
01:47:30,711 --> 01:47:35,214
The only way I can do that is if I'm 
able to talk to you about it now.

1660
01:47:37,217 --> 01:47:39,084
I'll manage somehow.
Don't worry about me.

1661
01:47:39,086 --> 01:47:41,620
No, I think it can
be better than that.

1662
01:47:42,622 --> 01:47:45,658
I think it can be better
than just managing.

1663
01:47:49,396 --> 01:47:52,164
What I'm...
What I'm trying to say is that...

1664
01:47:53,934 --> 01:47:57,369
The pain then is part
of the happiness now.

1665
01:48:20,026 --> 01:48:21,760
That's the deal.

1666
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:12,244
Yeah, that's good.

1667
01:49:14,047 --> 01:49:16,382
Don't go in the river. Yeah.

1668
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:19,652
You've got it. That's good.

1669
01:49:19,654 --> 01:49:20,719
That's it.

1670
01:49:24,524 --> 01:49:27,259
Douglas, come in,
and get warm for a while.

1671
01:50:03,129 --> 01:50:04,763
I'm sorry, Jack.

1672
01:50:36,062 --> 01:50:39,064
She'll be better here.
No stairs to climb.

1673
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:48,841
Can't you do something?

1674
01:50:49,476 --> 01:50:51,410
I'm afraid not.

1675
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:57,249
Douglas, you couldn't go and 
fetch the other pillow, could you?

1676
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:25,611
Thank you, doctor.

1677
01:51:25,613 --> 01:51:27,846
See you tomorrow.
Night-night.

1678
01:51:31,117 --> 01:51:32,985
Good night, young man.

1679
01:51:32,987 --> 01:51:34,286
Thanks for coming, Eddie.

1680
01:51:34,288 --> 01:51:36,021
A lot of silly fuss, huh?

1681
01:51:36,023 --> 01:51:37,122
Good night.

1682
01:51:37,124 --> 01:51:38,457
Get over here.

1683
01:51:38,459 --> 01:51:40,192
Good night, Jack.
Be in tomorrow.

1684
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:43,095
Come on.
Give me a hug.

1685
01:51:54,407 --> 01:51:57,876
You will remember it, 
I know you will. It'll be hard.

1686
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:00,612
Okay.

1687
01:52:03,249 --> 01:52:06,885
Remember what we talked about
because it's important, okay?

1688
01:52:06,887 --> 01:52:08,120
Okay?

1689
01:52:08,822 --> 01:52:10,689
Good night.

1690
01:52:10,691 --> 01:52:12,291
Good night, mummy.

1691
01:52:17,564 --> 01:52:19,131
Go straight to sleep.

1692
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:29,842
Blast.

1693
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:41,587
Here, it's all right. There.

1694
01:52:43,456 --> 01:52:46,692
God, I can't bear to see 
you in pain like this.

1695
01:52:50,363 --> 01:52:53,398
It's all right, Jack.
It keeps me quiet.

1696
01:52:57,771 --> 01:53:01,940
When it gets close, you find out 
whether you believe it or not, yes?

1697
01:53:03,943 --> 01:53:07,446
Don't you always say,
"real life hasn't begun yet"?

1698
01:53:09,048 --> 01:53:11,216
Jack, you better be right.

1699
01:53:32,138 --> 01:53:34,006
Still here?

1700
01:53:35,241 --> 01:53:37,075
Still here.

1701
01:53:40,413 --> 01:53:44,249
Go to bed. Get some sleep.

1702
01:53:46,419 --> 01:53:47,653
Soon.

1703
01:53:53,426 --> 01:53:55,160
I'm tired, Jack.

1704
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:58,997
I want to rest.

1705
01:54:01,534 --> 01:54:04,002
I just don't want to leave you.

1706
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,907
I don't want you to go.

1707
01:54:11,611 --> 01:54:13,345
Too much pain.

1708
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:16,415
I know.

1709
01:54:30,797 --> 01:54:35,701
I don't know what to do, Joy.
You'll have to tell me what to do.

1710
01:54:43,009 --> 01:54:45,043
You have to let me go.

1711
01:54:49,015 --> 01:54:51,049
I'm not sure that I can.

1712
01:55:07,367 --> 01:55:08,767
Can't hear you.

1713
01:55:08,769 --> 01:55:10,903
You will take care of Douglas?

1714
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:13,538
Of course.

1715
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:15,240
He pretends not to mind.

1716
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:18,410
- I know.
- Like you.

1717
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:23,415
No more pretending, not anymore.

1718
01:55:29,422 --> 01:55:31,590
I've loved you so, Jack.

1719
01:55:36,362 --> 01:55:40,265
Don't talk, my love. Just rest.

1720
01:55:43,736 --> 01:55:46,471
My love, just rest.

1721
01:55:52,445 --> 01:55:53,946
Just rest.

1722
01:56:24,243 --> 01:56:28,814
I love you, Joy.
I love you so much.

1723
01:56:31,084 --> 01:56:33,051
You've made me so happy.

1724
01:56:34,787 --> 01:56:37,022
I didn't know I could be so happy.

1725
01:56:39,258 --> 01:56:41,827
You're the truest
person I've ever known.

1726
01:56:47,133 --> 01:56:52,004
Sweet Jesus, be with
my beloved wife, Joy.

1727
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:57,175
Forgive me if I
love her too much.

1728
01:56:59,445 --> 01:57:01,413
Have mercy on us both.

1729
01:57:57,603 --> 01:57:59,571
"We, therefore, commit the body

1730
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:03,375
"of thy servant, Joy, 
to the elements,

1731
01:58:03,377 --> 01:58:06,044
"earth to earth,

1732
01:58:06,046 --> 01:58:08,513
"ashes to ashes,

1733
01:58:09,015 --> 01:58:11,450
"dust to dust."

1734
01:58:19,792 --> 01:58:21,626
This way, Douglas.

1735
01:58:24,197 --> 01:58:26,465
Thank God for your faith, Jack.

1736
01:58:26,467 --> 01:58:31,136
Because only faith makes any 
sense of times like this. I know.

1737
01:58:56,129 --> 01:58:58,363
What's happening to me, Warnie?

1738
01:59:00,633 --> 01:59:02,534
I can't see her anymore.

1739
01:59:03,836 --> 01:59:05,971
Can't remember her face.

1740
01:59:08,674 --> 01:59:10,942
I expect it's shock.

1741
01:59:10,944 --> 01:59:13,912
I'm so afraid of
never seeing her again...

1742
01:59:15,448 --> 01:59:18,817
Of thinking that suffering
is just suffering, after all.

1743
01:59:19,819 --> 01:59:22,821
No cause, no purpose, no pattern.

1744
01:59:23,256 --> 01:59:24,356
I...

1745
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:29,694
I don't know what
to tell you, Jack.

1746
01:59:32,365 --> 01:59:35,500
Nothing, there's nothing to say.

1747
01:59:36,769 --> 01:59:38,503
I know that now.

1748
01:59:40,306 --> 01:59:43,942
I've just come up against
a bit of experience, Warnie.

1749
01:59:44,944 --> 01:59:47,512
Experience is a brutal teacher,

1750
01:59:49,515 --> 01:59:53,685
but you learn. My God, you learn.

1751
01:59:59,158 --> 02:00:01,793
Sir, I really do think one or 
two of us should have gone.

1752
02:00:01,795 --> 02:00:03,495
Certainly not, we 
hardly knew the woman.

1753
02:00:03,497 --> 02:00:05,864
I haven't even seen him
for a couple of weeks.

1754
02:00:05,866 --> 02:00:07,532
I wouldn't say this to Jack,

1755
02:00:07,534 --> 02:00:10,202
but in the circumstances,
better sooner than later.

1756
02:00:10,204 --> 02:00:11,503
Is he taking it very hard?

1757
02:00:11,505 --> 02:00:12,703
Yes, I'm afraid so.

1758
02:00:12,905 --> 02:00:14,973
Rupert, could we have a word 
together out in the hall?

1759
02:00:14,975 --> 02:00:16,208
- Yes, sir.
- Evening, Jack.

1760
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:17,676
Nice to see you, Jack.

1761
02:00:17,678 --> 02:00:19,311
Jack.

1762
02:00:19,313 --> 02:00:21,980
I wasn't going to come,
but then I thought I would.

1763
02:00:21,982 --> 02:00:23,715
Life must go on.

1764
02:00:24,917 --> 02:00:27,852
I don't know that it must,
Harry, but it certainly does.

1765
02:00:27,854 --> 02:00:29,020
I'm sorry, Jack.

1766
02:00:29,022 --> 02:00:30,088
Thank you, Christopher.

1767
02:00:30,090 --> 02:00:31,690
We're all deeply sorry, Jack.

1768
02:00:31,692 --> 02:00:33,258
Thank you, president.

1769
02:00:33,759 --> 02:00:35,694
Anything I can do?

1770
02:00:35,696 --> 02:00:39,197
Yes, just don't tell me it's 
all for the best. That's all.

1771
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:42,100
Only God knows why these 
things have to happen, Jack.

1772
02:00:42,102 --> 02:00:43,835
God knows, but does God care?

1773
02:00:43,837 --> 02:00:45,270
Of course.

1774
02:00:45,272 --> 02:00:48,573
We see so little here.
We're not the creator.

1775
02:00:49,342 --> 02:00:52,010
No, we're the creatures, aren't we?

1776
02:00:52,012 --> 02:00:55,513
We're the... We're the rats in
the cosmic laboratory.

1777
02:00:55,515 --> 02:00:58,450
I've no doubt that the experiment
is for our own good,

1778
02:00:58,452 --> 02:01:00,885
but that still makes God the 
vivisectionist, doesn't it?

1779
02:01:00,887 --> 02:01:03,421
- Jack...
- No!

1780
02:01:03,923 --> 02:01:04,923
It won't do.

1781
02:01:07,593 --> 02:01:10,862
This is a bloody awful mess,
and that's all there is to it.

1782
02:01:12,131 --> 02:01:14,299
I'm sorry, Harry.
I am sorry, Christopher.

1783
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:19,037
I'm just not fit company 
tonight. That's all.

1784
02:01:25,778 --> 02:01:27,545
- Jack.
- Yes?

1785
02:01:27,547 --> 02:01:30,115
Your grief is your own business.
Maybe you feel life is a mess.

1786
02:01:30,117 --> 02:01:31,716
Maybe it is.
But there's Douglas.

1787
02:01:31,718 --> 02:01:33,618
- What about Douglas?
- Talk to him.

1788
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:35,287
I don't know what to say to him.

1789
02:01:35,289 --> 02:01:36,988
Just talk to him!

1790
02:01:54,907 --> 02:01:56,041
Hi.

1791
02:01:59,278 --> 02:02:00,412
Hi.

1792
02:02:15,127 --> 02:02:18,897
When my mother died,
I was your age.

1793
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,335
I thought that
if I prayed for her

1794
02:02:23,337 --> 02:02:26,204
to get better and 
if I really believed,

1795
02:02:26,206 --> 02:02:29,207
she'd get better.
Then, she wouldn't die.

1796
02:02:31,377 --> 02:02:32,911
But she did.

1797
02:02:36,015 --> 02:02:37,615
It doesn't work.

1798
02:02:37,617 --> 02:02:39,184
No, it doesn't work.

1799
02:02:41,721 --> 02:02:43,188
I don't care.

1800
02:02:46,492 --> 02:02:48,893
I loved your mother very much.

1801
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:54,699
Perhaps I loved her too 
much. She knew that.

1802
02:02:55,801 --> 02:02:59,304
She said to me, "is it worth it?"

1803
02:02:59,306 --> 02:03:02,073
Because she knew
what it would be like later.

1804
02:03:03,175 --> 02:03:05,243
It doesn't seem fair, does it?

1805
02:03:07,413 --> 02:03:09,781
I don't see why
she had to get sick.

1806
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:12,317
No, nor me.

1807
02:03:18,824 --> 02:03:22,660
But you can't hold
on to things, Douglas.

1808
02:03:24,597 --> 02:03:26,731
You have to let them go.

1809
02:03:35,908 --> 02:03:37,242
Jack?

1810
02:03:37,244 --> 02:03:38,576
Mmm-hmm.

1811
02:03:41,113 --> 02:03:42,914
Do you believe in heaven?

1812
02:03:47,186 --> 02:03:48,586
Yes, I do.

1813
02:03:53,726 --> 02:03:55,827
I don't believe in heaven.

1814
02:03:57,296 --> 02:03:58,797
That's okay.

1815
02:04:03,602 --> 02:04:06,037
I sure would like
to see her again.

1816
02:04:24,323 --> 02:04:26,124
Me, too.

1817
02:05:14,507 --> 02:05:16,274
Hello, who are you?

1818
02:05:16,276 --> 02:05:17,375
Chadwick, sir.

1819
02:05:17,377 --> 02:05:18,443
You're my tutor this term.

1820
02:05:18,445 --> 02:05:19,511
Am I?

1821
02:05:19,513 --> 02:05:21,913
Chadwick. Right. Come up.

1822
02:05:26,952 --> 02:05:28,052
Chadwick, you say?

1823
02:05:28,054 --> 02:05:29,187
Yes, sir.

1824
02:05:30,723 --> 02:05:32,123
Sit down.

1825
02:05:38,898 --> 02:05:42,901
"We read to know we're not alone."

1826
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:46,437
Do you think that is so?

1827
02:05:49,909 --> 02:05:52,710
Well, I hadn't thought 
of it before like that, sir.

1828
02:05:54,046 --> 02:05:55,647
No, nor had I.

1829
02:06:00,185 --> 02:06:01,753
I suppose some people would say,

1830
02:06:01,755 --> 02:06:04,255
"we love to know we're not alone."

1831
02:06:05,157 --> 02:06:06,224
Would you?

1832
02:06:07,493 --> 02:06:11,696
Well, if you mean "falling in love,"
well, I haven't really.

1833
02:06:11,698 --> 02:06:15,099
I mean, I probably know
more about love from books

1834
02:06:15,101 --> 02:06:17,168
than from personal experience.

1835
02:06:21,574 --> 02:06:25,710
Go on. I'm listening.

1836
02:06:25,712 --> 02:06:28,112
Well, I don't think any
of us want to be alone.

1837
02:06:30,115 --> 02:06:33,084
<i>Why love if losing 
hurts so much?</i>

1838
02:06:35,287 --> 02:06:37,689
<i>I have no answers anymore,</i>

1839
02:06:37,691 --> 02:06:39,824
<i>only the life I've lived.</i>

1840
02:06:41,794 --> 02:06:44,362
<i>Twice in that life,</i>

1841
02:06:44,364 --> 02:06:46,264
<i>I've been given the choice.</i>

1842
02:06:47,866 --> 02:06:49,334
<i>As a boy,</i>

1843
02:06:51,870 --> 02:06:53,371
<i>and as a man.</i>

1844
02:06:54,139 --> 02:06:56,274
<i>The boy chose safety.</i>

1845
02:06:56,276 --> 02:06:58,343
<i>The man chooses suffering.</i>

1846
02:07:01,113 --> 02:07:03,381
<i>The pain now</i>

1847
02:07:03,383 --> 02:07:05,516
<i>is part of the happiness then.</i>

1848
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:08,219
<i>That's the deal.</i>

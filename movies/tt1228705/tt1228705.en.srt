Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

it's you. It's always been you.

01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:31,541
Tony, I want you to meet
Agent Romanoff.

910
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:32,751
- Hi.
- I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

911
01:02:32,835 --> 01:02:35,463
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

912
01:02:35,545 --> 01:02:37,380
I suggest you apologize.

913
01:02:37,465 --> 01:02:39,007
You've been very busy.

914
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:42,344
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

915
01:02:42,427 --> 01:02:45,431
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

916
01:02:45,514 --> 01:02:46,891
Now, if I didn't know better...

917
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:48,976
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

918
01:02:49,059 --> 01:02:51,728
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

919
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:55,023
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

920
01:02:55,106 --> 01:02:57,902
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

921
01:02:57,985 --> 01:02:59,195
Is that possible?

922
01:02:59,277 --> 01:03:01,905
Well, according to Mr. Stark's
database security guidelines,

923
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:04,992
there are redundancies
to prevent unauthorized usage.

924
01:03:06,117 --> 01:03:07,286
(SNORTS SOFTLY)

925
01:03:07,786 --> 01:03:10,414
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you? Uh-uh.

926
01:03:10,498 --> 01:03:12,373
(STRESSING) What do you
want from me?

927
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:16,128
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

928
01:03:16,211 --> 01:03:19,465
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the center of my universe.

929
01:03:19,547 --> 01:03:22,592
I have bigger problems than you
in the southwest region to deal with.

930
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:23,719
Hit him.

931
01:03:23,927 --> 01:03:28,097
(GROANS) Oh, God, are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

932
01:03:28,724 --> 01:03:31,643
Could you please not do anything awful
for five seconds?

933
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:35,188
- What did she just do to me?
- What did we just do for you?

934
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,358
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

935
01:03:38,442 --> 01:03:40,318
We're trying to get you back to work.

936
01:03:40,402 --> 01:03:42,487
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

937
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:44,489
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.

938
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:47,076
Doesn't look like it's gonna be
an easy fix.

939
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:49,369
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

940
01:03:49,452 --> 01:03:51,829
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

941
01:03:51,914 --> 01:03:56,335
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

942
01:03:56,418 --> 01:03:59,505
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

943
01:04:00,965 --> 01:04:05,469
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.
Candygram.

944
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:13,726
HAMMER: I brought you something.
Oh, yeah.

945
01:04:14,603 --> 01:04:16,188
- (BIRD SQUAWKS)
- (HAMMER CHUCKLING)

946
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:18,106
We got you the bird, pal!

947
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:19,525
This is not my bird.

948
01:04:19,942 --> 01:04:23,195
What do you mean? That's the bird.
This is the bird. Yeah!

949
01:04:23,278 --> 01:04:26,282
Pulled a lot of strings to get this bird.
This is a great bird.

950
01:04:26,364 --> 01:04:28,992
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

951
01:04:29,076 --> 01:04:31,536
- (POUNDS TABLE)
- Hey, man, this not my bird.

952
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:37,793
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

953
01:04:37,876 --> 01:04:41,797
I mean, you know, look, don't get
so attached to things. Learn to let go.

954
01:04:42,255 --> 01:04:43,298
(BIRD SQUAWKS)

955
01:04:45,217 --> 01:04:47,469
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

956
01:04:48,262 --> 01:04:51,389
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

957
01:04:58,146 --> 01:04:59,815
Um...

958
01:04:59,898 --> 01:05:03,443
Ivan... What's this? Jack.

959
01:05:04,402 --> 01:05:06,447
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

960
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:09,115
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

961
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:11,034
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

962
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:14,329
Try to put your head in there.
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

963
01:05:14,413 --> 01:05:17,833
See, Ivan?
He can't put his head in there. That's...

964
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:21,545
That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

965
01:05:21,628 --> 01:05:25,007
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

966
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,467
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?

967
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:30,137
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

968
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:33,974
People make problem.
Trust me. Drone better.

969
01:05:34,432 --> 01:05:38,603
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

970
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,315
You said, "No problem."

971
01:05:41,398 --> 01:05:44,318
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

972
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,195
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

973
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:49,280
Like Iron Man. You understand?

974
01:05:49,364 --> 01:05:52,492
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

975
01:05:53,327 --> 01:05:54,661
Hey, man.

976
01:05:56,204 --> 01:06:00,501
Don't get too attached to things.
Learn to let go.

977
01:06:04,295 --> 01:06:07,298
These drones
better steal the show, Ivan.

978
01:06:07,925 --> 01:06:11,344
You understand?
Better rock my world, Ivan.

979
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:25,733
Unbelievable.
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

980
01:06:25,818 --> 01:06:29,195
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

981
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:32,490
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

982
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:34,992
Sir?

983
01:06:35,077 --> 01:06:37,704
Justin Hammer's making
a weapons presentation at the Expo.

984
01:06:37,788 --> 01:06:39,414
We'd like this to introduce it.

985
01:06:39,498 --> 01:06:41,083
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

986
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:43,918
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

987
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:47,088
- We've got to make this happen.
- Yes, General, but...

988
01:06:47,172 --> 01:06:49,173
It's also an order.

989
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:50,884
Yes, sir.

990
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,929
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

991
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:56,431
Thank you, sir.

992
01:07:02,603 --> 01:07:06,275
That thing in your chest
is based on unfinished technology.

993
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,360
No, it was finished.
It has never been particularly effective

994
01:07:09,445 --> 01:07:13,865
- until I miniaturized it and put it in my...
- No. Howard said the arc reactor

995
01:07:13,949 --> 01:07:15,701
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

996
01:07:15,784 --> 01:07:20,289
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

997
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:23,541
He was on to something big,
something so big

998
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,460
that it was gonna make
the nuclear reactor

999
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:27,545
look like a triple-A battery.

1000
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:30,132
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

1001
01:07:30,215 --> 01:07:33,302
Anton Vanko
is the other side of that coin.

1002
01:07:33,385 --> 01:07:35,387
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

1003
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:37,889
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

1004
01:07:37,972 --> 01:07:39,891
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

1005
01:07:39,974 --> 01:07:41,476
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

1006
01:07:41,601 --> 01:07:44,313
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

1007
01:07:44,438 --> 01:07:46,981
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

1008
01:07:47,065 --> 01:07:51,152
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

1009
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:52,905
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

1010
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:55,157
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?

1011
01:07:55,282 --> 01:07:59,494
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

1012
01:07:59,661 --> 01:08:01,663
to finish what he started.

1013
01:08:01,746 --> 01:08:03,248
- He said that?
- Mmm.

1014
01:08:03,414 --> 01:08:06,001
Are you that guy? Hmm? Are you?

1015
01:08:06,126 --> 01:08:11,422
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

1016
01:08:15,677 --> 01:08:17,179
I don't know
where you get your information,

1017
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,515
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

1018
01:08:19,597 --> 01:08:20,932
What do you remember about your dad?

1019
01:08:21,015 --> 01:08:22,768
He was cold, he was calculating.

1020
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:25,604
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me,

1021
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:27,271
so it's a little tough for me to digest

1022
01:08:27,355 --> 01:08:29,774
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

1023
01:08:29,858 --> 01:08:32,277
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

1024
01:08:32,944 --> 01:08:34,195
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

1025
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:35,780
was when he shipped me off
to boarding school.

1026
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:36,948
That's not true.

1027
01:08:37,032 --> 01:08:39,701
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

1028
01:08:40,118 --> 01:08:43,788
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1029
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:45,039
What?

1030
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:47,626
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1031
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:49,293
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

1032
01:08:49,377 --> 01:08:51,128
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

1033
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:53,047
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

1034
01:08:53,172 --> 01:08:56,385
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

1035
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:59,387
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

1036
01:08:59,846 --> 01:09:01,347
Oh, and Tony,

1037
01:09:02,557 --> 01:09:05,560
remember, I got my eye on you.

1038
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:14,485
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

1039
01:09:14,987 --> 01:09:16,363
Good luck.

1040
01:09:20,408 --> 01:09:21,702
Please.

1041
01:09:22,243 --> 01:09:25,497
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

1042
01:09:25,581 --> 01:09:27,748
If we could send one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

1043
01:09:27,832 --> 01:09:30,418
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run,
or something like that, that'd be nice.

1044
01:09:30,502 --> 01:09:33,171
I'm not here for that.
I've been authorized by Director Fury

1045
01:09:33,255 --> 01:09:35,673
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

1046
01:09:35,756 --> 01:09:38,426
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

1047
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:41,680
I will tase you and watch <i>Supernanny</i>
while you drool into the carpet.

1048
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:44,015
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

1049
01:09:44,099 --> 01:09:46,018
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

1050
01:10:12,377 --> 01:10:17,048
- Think this is the power source?
- Major, this is not a scientific exercise.

1051
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:19,091
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

1052
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:21,302
Yes, sir.

1053
01:10:21,761 --> 01:10:23,055
HAMMER: Oh, yes!

1054
01:10:23,471 --> 01:10:27,391
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday?

1055
01:10:27,475 --> 01:10:30,938
You got it.

- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

1654
01:53:09,534 --> 01:53:12,246
- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.
- Okay. What about the press?

1655
01:53:12,329 --> 01:53:14,206
Because you only had the job for a week.
That's gonna seem...

1656
01:53:14,289 --> 01:53:16,082
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

1657
01:53:16,167 --> 01:53:17,542
I mean, it's like the Presidency...

1658
01:53:30,597 --> 01:53:32,766
- Weird.
- (SOFTLY) No, it's not weird.

1659
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:34,185
- It's okay, right?
- Yeah.

1660
01:53:34,268 --> 01:53:35,603
Run that by me again.

1661
01:53:35,685 --> 01:53:37,188
RHODES: I think it was weird.

1662
01:53:37,979 --> 01:53:40,940
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1663
01:53:41,484 --> 01:53:43,944
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...

1664
01:53:44,028 --> 01:53:46,529
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

1665
01:53:46,613 --> 01:53:49,074
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

(TONY CHUCKLES)

1667
01:53:50,451 --> 01:53:52,994
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

1668
01:53:53,078 --> 01:53:55,706
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.

1669
01:53:55,789 --> 01:53:58,292
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,

1670
01:53:58,376 --> 01:54:01,545
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?

1671
01:54:01,628 --> 01:54:03,381
Not okay. Not okay with that.

1672
01:54:03,963 --> 01:54:05,216
It wasn't a question.

1673
01:54:10,805 --> 01:54:12,264
How are you gonna resign

1674
01:54:13,099 --> 01:54:14,225
if I don't accept?

1675
01:54:14,307 --> 01:54:16,143
- (PEPPER LAUGHS)
- Hmm?

1676
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:36,037
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1677
01:54:37,081 --> 01:54:39,250
I'm not sure it pertains to you anymore.

1678
01:54:39,332 --> 01:54:44,587
Now this, on the other hand,
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

1679
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:47,966
- Read it.
- Uh...

1680
01:54:48,842 --> 01:54:52,846
"Personality overview. Mr. Stark displays
compulsive behavior."

1681
01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:55,099
In my own defense, that was last week.

1682
01:54:57,143 --> 01:54:59,979
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.

1683
01:55:00,104 --> 01:55:02,689
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

1684

1685
01:55:07,944 --> 01:55:09,029
Agreed.

01:55:10,113 --> 01:55:11,489
Okay, here it is. Uh...

1687
01:55:11,573 --> 01:55:14,909
"Recruitment assessment
for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1688
01:55:14,993 --> 01:55:17,537
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

1689

1690

"Not recommended"?

1691
01:55:24,461 --> 01:55:25,671
That doesn't make any sense.

1692
01:55:25,753 --> 01:55:28,673
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

1696
01:55:38,184 --> 01:55:40,060
Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

1697
01:55:40,144 --> 01:55:43,314
we'd only like to use you
as a consultant.

1698
01:55:50,237 --> 01:55:52,113
You can't afford me.

1699
01:55:54,449 --> 01:55:56,702
Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer

1700
01:55:56,784 --> 01:55:59,662
in exchange for a small favor.

1701

Rhodey and I are being honored
in Washington and we need a presenter.

01:56:07,378 --> 01:56:08,881
I'll see what I can do.

Oh, sorry.

00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,708
'cause I'm changing
on the plane.

320
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:10,578
- Hi.
- [Freddy chuckling]

321
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,748
- Ohh.
- [Freddy coughing]

322
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:15,951
- Oh, Freddy.
- [groans]

323
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,854
Nothing a little
rum and ginger can't fix.

324
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:20,255
Good.

325
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:24,092
Well, I see you got
Solomon's rocket fuel here.

326
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:27,561
- Yup.
- Ah. Best rum on the island.

327
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:29,530
Yeah, I know.
Don't get any ideas, though.

328
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,466
All of this makes it
to the wedding, Freddy.

329
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,800
- I know Pascale don't play.
- Yeah.

330
00:20:32,934 --> 00:20:34,503
Thank you for taking
all that abuse.

331
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,339
And thank you for giving me a ride.
You are a life-saver.

332
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:40,976
Don't think you're special.
You're not the only passenger.

333
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,577
No VIPs here on this trip.

334
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:46,381
Okay.

335
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,283
Wyman, man,
did you fix that hatch?

336
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:53,055
Well, you're welcome to fix it
anytime you like.

337
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:54,890
[Freddy chuckles]

338
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,893
Hit and run again, huh? Nice.

339
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:00,262
[whispers] Fuck.

340
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:03,597
[Freddy] Gentle with her.
She's an old girl.

341
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,800
There you go. [chuckles]

342
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:08,870
Ahh.

343
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:10,604
This is your captain
welcoming you

344
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:11,873
to Wyman Air Flight 227.

345
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:13,674
Our approximate flying time

346
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,776
is going to be 99 minutes.

347
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:18,080
Ain't nothing but ocean
all the way.

348
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:21,615
Now, it's gonna get loud
up in here,

349
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:24,119
so, uh, put on your headsets,

350
00:21:24,252 --> 00:21:26,754
in case you want
a little tête-à-tête.

351
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,194
[Jackson] Hey, Freddy,
after the wedding,

352
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:34,762
you wanna go check out
that reef outside Rodrigues?

353
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:36,697
- Sure, man.
- You should also go

354
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,867
to the place
that we used to take...

355
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,903
[Freddy] Tower, come in.

356
00:21:42,037 --> 00:21:44,940
This is WA227 requesting
permission for takeoff.

357
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:47,809
[man on radio] <i>Come in, 227.
Freddy, how you doing?</i>

358
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:51,779
Just looking forward to some
barbecued ribs and a piña colada.

359
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:53,448
Will we see you
at the wedding?

360
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:55,951
<i>I wish I could, buddy,
but duty calls. Enjoy.</i>

361
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:57,986
<i>227, you're cleared
for takeoff.</i>

362
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,321
Off we go.

363
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:26,982
Westward heading
coming right up.

364
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:39,127
[Freddy] Sara.

365
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:41,062
Sara.

366
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:46,201
Can you hear me now?

367
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:47,335
Loud and clear.

368
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:52,073
Sara, come on up here and sit
with me in the copilot seat.

369
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,109
For old times' sake.

370
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,044
Freddy,
you're gonna want me to fly

371
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:57,846
and I'm too hungover to do that.

372
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:59,915
[Freddy] Get up here.

373
00:23:01,116 --> 00:23:02,150
[scoffs]

374
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:09,257
[man] <i>WA227, you're leaving our zone.
Have a good flight.</i>

375
00:23:09,391 --> 00:23:11,092
All right.
See you later, Sammy.

376
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:12,760
[Freddy] Out.

377
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:22,971
So, how's life treating you?

378
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:25,307
You got a fella?

379
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,676
We're going to talk
about this already?

380
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,044
Uh, yeah.

381
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,446
Uh, okay.

382
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,519
Yeah, I'm dating.
But there's...

383
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,256
- There's nothing, really.
- Mm-hmm.

384
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:44,725
- Well...
- [chuckles]

385
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:49,730
- [Sara] How are you?
- I miss her every day.

386
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:52,400
Longest year of my life.

387
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:54,436
I'm so sorry.

388
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:57,405
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when it happened.

389
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:58,573
Don't be.

390
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:03,345
You were made for each other.
I can't imagine how hard it's been.

391
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,415
You learn to live
with the pain.

392
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:09,750
Love isn't being
made for each other.

393
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:12,254
It's being willing
to make things work.

394
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:14,956
You gotta want it.

395
00:24:15,624 --> 00:24:17,359
It was never easy
with Eleanor.

396
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:18,960
Oh, my God, no.

397
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:24,499
[sighs]

398
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,301
So, you ready to give it a go?

399
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:29,070
No. I can't believe you think I'm
gonna remember how to do this.

400
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:32,140
Come on. There's nothing you
could do that I can't correct.

401
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:37,212
Look, make sure that the
altimeter stays below 20,000 feet.

402
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:39,314
Because you know what happens
at 20,000 feet.

403
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:42,150
- Yes, altitude sickness. Yeah, I remember.
- [chuckling]

404
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:46,288
Look, ma!

405
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:47,822
[laughing]

406
00:24:47,956 --> 00:24:49,424
There's nothing
to crash into up here.

407
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:51,926
I know. But, Freddy,
you said you'd be good.

408
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,495
Look, you were a natural.

409
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:55,397
I need an heir to my fortune.

410
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:58,533
I'm gonna turn off
the autopilot.

411
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:02,070
Now, if you don't
grab that yoke,

412
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:06,341
you'll have about 20 seconds before
she'll start to veer off course.

413
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:08,443
- Freddy.
- Grab that yoke.

414
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:10,045
- No.
- And make sure

415
00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:12,280
that the horizon
stays level, right here.

416
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:16,551
Don't be a defeatist.

417
00:25:19,054 --> 00:25:21,956
You always were
a bullheaded one. [chuckles]

418
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,160
[gasps, coughing]

419
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:28,330
- You okay?
- [canister clanking]

420
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:31,900
- You sure?
- [Freddy] Uh-huh.

421
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:34,002
[Sara] Can I get you something?

422
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:37,305
Freddy?

423
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:40,241
[coughing]

424
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,143
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

425
00:25:42,577 --> 00:25:45,046
- Where are your pills?
- I need... I need water.

426
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,848
Okay, where do I get you
some water?

427
00:25:47,315 --> 00:25:49,150
- In the back.
- In the back? Okay.

428
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:50,518
Hey, Jackson!

429
00:25:52,654 --> 00:25:53,988
Okay. It's okay.

430
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:57,559
Jackson!
He's having a heart attack.

431
00:25:57,692 --> 00:25:59,361
He needs water for his meds.

432
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:00,528
Quick!

433
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,264
Here, here, here.

434
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:05,166
Take these.
Take these. Take these.

435
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:07,969
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

436
00:26:08,103 --> 00:26:09,637
Jackson, hurry!

437
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:16,478
[gasping]

438
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:22,050
Jackson,
pull him off the yoke!

439
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:26,955
- Look out!
- [Sara screams]

440
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:29,424
[gasping continues]

441
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:32,660
Pull him off the yoke!

442
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:39,334
Shit!

443
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,704
- Oh, my God!
- Sara, pull us up!

444
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:44,606
I'm trying! [screams]

445
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:46,541
- Come on!
- I can't.

446
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:47,877
Hold him.

447
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:49,978
Come on. Pull us up!
What are you doing?

448
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:52,447
- [Sara yells]
- Sara, you can do it.

449
00:26:52,848 --> 00:26:54,516
- Oh, God!
- Pull us up!

450
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:57,419
[both groan]

451
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:10,965
- [sighs]
- [groans]

452
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:21,042
- Is he breathing?
- I don't know.

453
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,415
- Okay, Freddy.
- Help him.

454
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,485
- Do CPR. Do something.
- There's no pulse.

455
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:35,156
Come on.

456
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:39,527
- Come on.
- Come on, please.

457
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:42,597
Come on.

458
00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:46,201
Four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

459
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:48,203
- Come on.
- Please. Please.

460
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:50,906
Four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

461
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,675
- Freddy?
- No, no, no.

462
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:58,079
Come on!

463
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:02,584
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.

464
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:06,187
Freddy, man.

465
00:28:13,461 --> 00:28:14,596
Sorry.

466
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:20,001
Oh, Freddy.

467
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:29,677
[gasps]

468
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,492
No. No.

469
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:06,180
Can you fly this plane?

470
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,150
No.

471
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:11,854
But you're doing it right now.

472
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:15,824
I mean, I took a few lessons,
but it was years ago, okay?

473
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:18,426
Put on your seat belt.

474
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:23,731
Okay. Is everything
still working?

475
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:28,037
Jackson, the GPS is broken.

476
00:29:28,436 --> 00:29:30,371
Our phones have GPS.

477
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,276
Oh, shit. Mine's dead.
Let me see yours.

478
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:41,449
Nothing.

479
00:29:43,953 --> 00:29:45,921
- The radio.
- Oh. Yes.

480
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:47,890
Hello. Can anyone hear me?

481
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:50,525
Please come in. This is an emergency.
We have no pilot.

482
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:54,162
This is a distress call.
I repeat, this is a distress call.

483
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:55,530
Try another frequency.

484
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,299
If you can hear me,
if anyone is listening,

485
00:29:58,433 --> 00:30:00,335
please, it's an emergency.

486
00:30:01,804 --> 00:30:03,771
- What about shortwave?
- What good is shortwave?

487
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:05,206
Just try it.

488
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,608
Hello. Please come in.
Please come in.

489
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:08,309
Our pilot
has had a heart attack.

490
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:10,012
We don't even know
which direction we're going in.

491
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:12,747
We have no idea where we are.
We could really use some help.

492
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:16,517
So please, please,
please come in if you can hear us, please.

493
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:21,456
It's okay. Someone heard it.
Someone's gotta be out there.

494
00:30:27,228 --> 00:30:28,463
Autopilot.

495
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,698
Autopilot.

496
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,501
Freddy should've programmed it
to fly us to Rodrigues.

497
00:30:33,635 --> 00:30:35,904
Then we can worry about
the landing when we get there.

498
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:44,913
[exhales]

499
00:30:57,926 --> 00:30:59,460
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

500
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:01,496
It shouldn't be doing that.

501
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:07,669
Freddy said it starts to list
after 20 seconds of manual.

502
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:11,239
God, Jackson, what if
the autopilot's broken?

503
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,378
How much fuel do we have?
It's right there.

504
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:21,116
- Half a tank.
- That should be enough, right?

505
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:22,684
Not if we're lost.

506
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:28,289
So, we have no pilot,
no autopilot, no GPS.

507
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:32,627
And neither of us
can land a plane.

508
00:31:40,102 --> 00:31:41,402
I can't see any sign of land.

509
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:43,471
The compass.
Is the compass broken?

510
00:31:44,106 --> 00:31:45,107
No, I don't think so.

511
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,675
Which direction
were we heading in before?

512
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,378
Um, west. We were heading west.

513
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:52,881
- Okay.
- So we just need to turn 90 degrees.

514
00:31:53,949 --> 00:31:56,350
- No, no, no, wait, turn back.
- Why?

515
00:31:56,484 --> 00:31:59,721
Because west from here isn't the same
as west from where we were before.

516
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:01,990
- Could take us even further out to sea.
- Shit, you're right.

517
00:32:02,124 --> 00:32:06,694
So we took off at 8:40,
and we got spun around at 9:20.

518
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:10,165
And it's 9:30 right now.
Which means we've been flying north...

519
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:11,232
That's ten minutes.

520
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:13,102
So we can do a 180,

521
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:14,903
head south
for exactly ten minutes.

522
00:32:15,037 --> 00:32:17,672
And then head west. And that
should get us back to the mainland.

523
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,373
Okay.

524
00:32:19,507 --> 00:32:21,342
- I'm setting a timer.
- Good.

525
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:22,911
You ready?
I'm gonna turn around now.

526
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:25,246
Yes, south for ten minutes.
Then we turn west.

527
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:27,615
Okay. Heading south now.

528
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:58,679
- [thunder rumbling]
- Holy shit. Look at that.

529
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:05,988
We'll fly right past it.

530
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,357
[plane rattling]

531
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,592
How much longer?

532
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:13,728
We're almost there.

533
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:16,597
Looks like it's moving.
It's everywhere.

534
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,400
Can't we somehow go around it?

535
00:33:21,003 --> 00:33:22,470

- <i>227, come in. Freddy.</i>

539
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:33,849
- We're here. Can you hear me?
- <i>Roger, 227. We can hear you.</i>

540
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:35,716
Hello, yes, we're here.

541
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:38,386
<i>Can you please identify
your aircraft? Do you copy?</i>

542
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,155
This is 227.

<i>Who am I speaking to?</i>

544
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,992
This is Sara Johnson
and Jackson Davisen.

545
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:46,360
We are passengers on flight 227.

546
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:48,163
We were headed to Rodrigues.

547
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:50,331
There's a storm in front of us.
Our pilot is dead.

548
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:53,101
We don't know where we're going.
We could really use your help.

549
00:33:53,235 --> 00:33:54,702
<i>Freddy Wyman is dead?</i>

550
00:33:57,206 --> 00:33:58,974
Yes, he had a heart attack.

551
00:33:59,274 --> 00:34:00,541
It's just us up here.

552
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:04,880
<i>Sara, are you the one
flying the plane?</i>

553
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:08,851
Yeah, Freddy took me up with him
a couple of times two years ago.

554
00:34:08,984 --> 00:34:11,253
But that's it.
I've never been up here solo.

555
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:12,720
You can get us
out of this, right?

556
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:14,455
<i>You've still got her
in the air,</i>

<i>Sara, my name is Samuel,</i>

559
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,829
<i>and I'm going to try
and help you, okay?</i>

560
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:22,396
<i>How much fuel do you have?</i>

561
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,564
How much fuel?

562
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:25,800
Thirty-five percent left
in the main tank.

563
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:28,136
We have about 35 percent left
in the main tank.

564
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,504
Samuel, you're breaking up
a little bit.

565
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,108
<i>Can you please try to give me
some details about your location?</i>

<i>I haven't got you
on my screen here.</i>

567
00:34:34,943 --> 00:34:37,145
Yeah, we've turned around.
We're about...

568
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:40,983
fifty-five minutes
from where we took off.

569
00:34:41,116 --> 00:34:43,718
Maybe you can use the storm
to locate us, though.

570
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:49,091
- Samuel, please come in.
- [radio: static bursts]

571
00:34:49,224 --> 00:34:50,926
No, no, Samuel, don't do this.

00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:53,028
Samuel? Hello!

573
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:56,664
It's okay. He's gonna be able to
work out our location. It'll be fine.

574
00:34:57,132 --> 00:34:58,166
Samuel!

[Samuel] <i>I can see the storm.</i>

<i>you will run the risk
of running out of fuel.</i>

578
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,077
<i>You have to turn west to reach land.
Do you understand? Copy.</i>

579
00:35:14,082 --> 00:35:16,417
Did you just say to turn west
into the storm?

580
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:19,154
<i>Yes. West is your
quickest route to land.</i>

581
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:21,890
<i>The storm is too big
to fly around.</i>

582
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:25,559
Samuel, is there any way
we could land on the water?

583
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:27,762
How am I supposed to land on the water?
I've never even landed on land.

584
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:29,463
I don't know. I'm just asking.

585
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:31,666
<i>No, no, do not land
on the water.</i>

586
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:33,601
<i>No, do not attempt
to land on the water.</i>

587
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:35,203
<i>You will crash and sink.</i>

588
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:37,272
<i>We'll have no way
of locating you.</i>

589
00:35:37,406 --> 00:35:40,775
<i>Please keep flying west
until you reach land.</i>

00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:43,412
<i>Don't worry.
Keep the aircraft level...</i>

He'll be back.
It's just the storm.

594
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:50,185
- He said to go west.
- Are you serious?

595
00:35:51,153 --> 00:35:52,586
West?

596
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:55,824
That's what he said.

[thunder rumbling]

598
00:36:33,395 --> 00:36:35,663
I think you should be sitting
in the pilot's seat.

599
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,265
- Really?
- Yeah.

600
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:39,234
You need to see the dials.

601
00:36:39,368 --> 00:36:40,601
Let's switch.

602
00:36:57,252 --> 00:36:58,286
Shit.

603
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:07,062
- Samuel said to stay at the same altitude.
- You gotta be kidding me.

00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,566
You can do this.

00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:15,971
The problem is,
what if I can't?

606

This is insane. We are not
flying through this.

Are you crazy?

Samuel said to go through it.

Uh, clear skies.
That's what I'm hoping.

No, no, Sara, don't do this.

We're getting altitude sickness.
We need to fly lower.

Oh, the dials are
sort of moving.

I'm fine.

Sara, wake up!

00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:19,327
Come on!

634
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:26,935
- [gasps]
- [both screaming]

635
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,309
- Why are we falling?
- I don't know.

636
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:36,344
I've lost control.
Nothing's working.

637
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:38,914
I told you
we should have stayed lower!

638
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:41,249
Getting lower
isn't the problem!

639
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:45,187
Samuel, come in!
Mayday! Mayday!

640
00:39:46,388 --> 00:39:47,656
Mayday! Mayday!

641
00:39:47,822 --> 00:39:50,125
- [thunderclap]
- [Sara screaming]

642
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:58,967
- I can't see anything. I can't...
- [Sara] I'm gonna be sick!

643
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:07,708
[Jackson screams]

644
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:12,914
[Jackson, Sara shouting]

645
00:40:21,189 --> 00:40:24,259
- Oh!
- [Sara gasping, panting]

646
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,134
Sara, are you okay?

647
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:37,239
Wh... Where are we heading?
Which direction are we going?

648
00:40:39,074 --> 00:40:42,911
- I don't know. The compass is smashed.
- Well, that's just great.

649
00:40:44,212 --> 00:40:46,548
[Sara] We need to head west
or we're gonna fly in circles.

650
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:48,083
I'll be right back.

651
00:40:49,584 --> 00:40:51,319
What are you doing?

652
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:03,932
- Hold on.
- Will you just tell me what you're doing?

653
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:06,434
I think I remember
how to make a compass.

654
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:08,236
Really?

655
00:41:20,382 --> 00:41:23,585
If you magnetize a needle
and float it in liquid,

656
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:25,220
it should point north.

657
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:26,787
For real?

658
00:41:32,327 --> 00:41:34,562
Holy shit.
This is actually working.

659
00:41:34,696 --> 00:41:35,864
Really?

660
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:38,099
[thunder crashing]

661
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:39,167
Shit.

662
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:41,169
- Did you see it?
- That's north.

663
00:41:41,303 --> 00:41:43,204
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

664
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:45,907
- That's west?
- Yeah.

665
00:41:47,976 --> 00:41:49,577
[high-pitched
mechanical screeching]

666
00:41:49,711 --> 00:41:52,547
[Jackson] Sounds like the whole
engine is ripping apart.

667
00:42:01,356 --> 00:42:03,792
[laughing] Oh, thank God, Sara.

668
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:06,361
[both gasping, exclaiming]

669
00:42:07,295 --> 00:42:10,031
You did it. [laughing]

670
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:13,101
[Sara laughing]

671
00:42:18,808 --> 00:42:20,342
[whimpers]

672
00:42:21,343 --> 00:42:24,346
[sighs] I never should have
gotten on this plane.

673
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:28,083
If you hadn't,
I'd be dead by now, so...

674
00:42:29,784 --> 00:42:31,219
thanks.

675
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:39,961
Samuel, do you copy?

676
00:42:40,095 --> 00:42:42,564
- [static crackling]
- Samuel.

677
00:42:43,665 --> 00:42:45,800
If you can hear us,
we made it through the storm.

678
00:42:45,934 --> 00:42:47,869
We're heading west,
looking for land.

679
00:42:49,805 --> 00:42:51,973
- Samuel.
- [static burst]

680
00:42:52,808 --> 00:42:54,476
Maybe they can hear us.

681
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,444
I don't know.

682
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,616
Just fly west, like he said.

683
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,418
Yeah, until we find land.

684
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:05,520
Yeah, and then what?

685
00:43:32,747 --> 00:43:36,886
The fuel. Five percent?
Jackson, it was at 35 before the storm.

686
00:43:37,018 --> 00:43:38,553
Five percent?

687
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:46,661
[Jackson chuckles nervously]

688
00:43:50,098 --> 00:43:52,434
Wait. I think I can switch
between the tanks.

689
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,375
Ha!

690
00:44:00,508 --> 00:44:03,378
Oh, I was so scared
for a second there.

691
00:44:04,412 --> 00:44:05,680
Whew.

692
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:15,356
Fuel gauges go down. That's...

693
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:18,828
- Not that fast.
- Yeah, but it's just...

694
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,729
It's adjusting from
the transfer. It'll settle.

695
00:44:24,232 --> 00:44:25,467
It'll settle.

696
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,504
Shit.

697
00:44:29,637 --> 00:44:31,539
- There's gotta be a leak.
- Shit.

698
00:44:31,673 --> 00:44:33,809
There's two tanks, right?
Where are they?

699
00:44:33,943 --> 00:44:35,410
They're out there
on the wings.

700
00:44:35,543 --> 00:44:37,947
There's gotta be a leak
in one of the tanks

701
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,047
or the fuel lines or...

702
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,448
Remember that screeching sound

703
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:42,050
under the hood
during the storm?

704
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:43,718
Maybe something
broke loose in there

705
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:45,086
and caused some damage.

706
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:49,390
Jackson, what's that look?

707
00:44:49,892 --> 00:44:52,060
Jackson, what are you thinking?
I know that look.

708
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:54,395
I'm gonna have to go outside.

709
00:44:56,832 --> 00:44:58,666
- Of the plane?
- Yeah.

710
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:02,604
- Wait. What? Are you serious?
- At the rate that's dropping,

711
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:05,139
we'll be out of fuel
in about 15 minutes.

712
00:45:05,273 --> 00:45:07,208
Jackson,
we don't go outside the plane!

713
00:45:07,342 --> 00:45:09,777
That is so dangerous. I can't
believe you're even talking about it.

714
00:45:09,912 --> 00:45:12,447
Look, if we run out of fuel,
we're finished, okay?

715
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,482
You could fall,
you could unbalance the plane

716
00:45:14,616 --> 00:45:15,951
and we could both, you know...

717
00:45:16,084 --> 00:45:17,585
The wind could blow you off,

718
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:19,721
or you could get out there
and not even be able to open it.

719
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:22,624
Do I have to keep listing
the ways that this is stupid?

720
00:45:22,757 --> 00:45:24,392
There. Better?

721
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:50,251
Can you slow us down?

722
00:45:59,962 --> 00:46:01,462
That's as much as I can do.

723
00:46:30,124 --> 00:46:31,526
[Sara screams]

724
00:46:32,995 --> 00:46:34,295
[gasps]

725
00:46:56,852 --> 00:46:58,252
Oh, my God!

726
00:46:59,855 --> 00:47:01,422
Be careful!

727
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:02,858
No shit!

728
00:47:09,865 --> 00:47:11,566
[grunts]

729
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:13,836
[mouthing words]

730
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:15,703
[Sara screams]

731
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:18,506
Jackson!

732
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:31,820
Come on, Jackson. You can do it.

733
00:47:54,076 --> 00:47:55,811
Come on. Come on. Come on.

734
00:48:00,983 --> 00:48:02,216
Come on, come on.

735
00:48:07,156 --> 00:48:08,389
Come on.

736
00:48:23,271 --> 00:48:26,574
Come on. Just stick, just stick!
[grunts]

737
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:29,777
Jackson, it's working!
It's leveling out!

738
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:43,658
Jackson!

739
00:48:44,325 --> 00:48:47,096
[screaming]

740
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:48,629
Sara!

741
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,133
I can't hold on!

742
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:53,801
Sara, my arm!

743
00:48:54,402 --> 00:48:55,804
- Help me!
- Jackson!

744
00:48:55,938 --> 00:48:57,405
Hold on tight, okay?

745
00:48:57,538 --> 00:48:59,141
Put your foot on the wheel.

746
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:01,676
[grunting] I'm trying!

747
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:08,316
- Can you jump?
- [both grunt]

748
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:11,987
Hold on!

749
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:19,260
I'll be right there!

750
00:49:21,063 --> 00:49:22,563
Okay, okay, okay.

751
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:28,436
- Jackson!
- [gasps]

752
00:49:28,569 --> 00:49:29,872
Jackson, take my hand!

753
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:32,573
- Can you jump?
- The rope's wrapped around the wheel.

754
00:49:33,474 --> 00:49:35,543
We need to cut the rope.
Cut the rope.

755
00:49:35,676 --> 00:49:37,946
There's a wire
cutter in the back of the plane.

756
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:42,283
Okay.

757
00:49:43,185 --> 00:49:47,256
Come on, Jackson. Look at me.
You can do it. Come on.

758
00:49:47,388 --> 00:49:48,957
- Take my hand.
- Okay.

759
00:49:51,994 --> 00:49:53,628
Okay. Ready?

760
00:49:56,131 --> 00:49:59,268
One, two, three.

761
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,303
[both screaming]

762
00:50:11,113 --> 00:50:14,482
[gasping, panting]

763
00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:17,019
[Jackson groaning]

764
00:50:22,891 --> 00:50:24,659
[Sara laughs] Oh, my God.

765
00:50:26,494 --> 00:50:28,629
- [gasping, groaning]
- Okay.

766
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,731
Okay.

767
00:50:32,267 --> 00:50:34,702
[grunting]

768
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:38,040
Come on.

769
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:45,446
Okay. Hey, hey, sit up. Sit up.

770
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:50,986
- Are you okay?
- [groaning]

771
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,221
Are you okay?

772
00:50:52,353 --> 00:50:55,123
Jackson, look at me.
Are you okay?

773
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:58,861
- My ar... My a-a-arm.
- What's that? What happened?

774
00:50:59,161 --> 00:51:00,829
Oh, my God! Holy shit.

775
00:51:00,963 --> 00:51:02,331
Don't look, don't look,
don't look.

776
00:51:02,463 --> 00:51:04,599
Jacks... Okay, hey, hey, hey.

777
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:06,801
Hey, stay here. Stay with me.

778
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:10,839
It's not that bad.
I'm gonna find a way to clean it, okay?

779
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:12,506
Stay here.

780
00:51:13,275 --> 00:51:16,812
- I'll be right here.
- Yeah, you will. Okay, yeah.

781
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:40,168
[screams]

782
00:51:40,302 --> 00:51:42,403
You're crazy! Stop! Stop!

783
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:44,373
[groans] God!

784
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:47,309
Okay, for this next part,
I think I'm supposed to distract you.

785
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:49,912
No, please don't, please don't.
I just wanna focus.

786
00:51:50,045 --> 00:51:52,613
Okay, I'm gonna let you focus.
I just wanna tell you

787
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:54,415
that I keep having flashbacks
to last night.

788
00:51:54,548 --> 00:51:55,817
What? Which part?

789
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:58,719
- [bone crunches]
- [screams, groaning]

790
00:51:59,922 --> 00:52:01,722
Oh, my God.
That must have hurt so much.

791
00:52:01,857 --> 00:52:03,691
I can't believe I just did that.

792
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:07,996
[groans] Be careful.

793
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,598
Careful, careful.

00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:12,968
You're fine. You're fine.

[groans]

796
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:18,673
That was amazing
what you just did.

797
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:22,978
So stupid, but so amazing.

798
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:27,149
I assume you're still talking
about last night.

799
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:40,929
How does that feel?

800
00:52:41,629 --> 00:52:43,198
Thank you, Doctor.

801
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:45,233
[sighs]

802
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:49,905
That's very unprofessional,
Doctor.

803
00:53:08,857 --> 00:53:10,691
What does the gauge say?

804
00:53:11,994 --> 00:53:14,595
Five percent and holding.

805
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:16,530
For now.

806
00:53:17,899 --> 00:53:20,735
[Jackson] Let's hope it keeps us
flying till we find land.

807
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:26,540
Maybe we can lighten the plane.

808
00:53:26,674 --> 00:53:29,144
Buy ourselves some time,
burn less fuel.

809
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:34,016
- Do you think the seats come out?
- That could work.

[shouts]

816
00:54:18,827 --> 00:54:21,029
- That do anything?
- Well, it's holding.

817
00:54:22,264 --> 00:54:24,266
Did you clear everything?

818
00:54:24,698 --> 00:54:25,934
Um...

819
00:54:42,117 --> 00:54:43,717
I'll do it.

820
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:47,856
You just keep
the plane steady, okay?

821
00:55:04,306 --> 00:55:06,341
- [muffled] Jackson!
- Sorry! Sorry, sorry.

822
00:55:57,526 --> 00:55:59,027
Goodbye, Freddy.

823
00:56:34,963 --> 00:56:36,398
We had to.

824
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:40,135
It was the right thing to do.

825
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,875
How are we doing on fuel?

826
00:56:51,046 --> 00:56:52,780
We're running out of time.

827
00:56:54,683 --> 00:56:56,784
Okay, just keep looking
for land.

828
00:56:58,086 --> 00:57:00,754
- I'll get rid of these.
- Wait.

829
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:04,359
It's Solomon's rocket fuel,
right?

830
00:57:05,694 --> 00:57:07,062
It's ethanol.

831
00:57:07,195 --> 00:57:09,831
I mean, couldn't it
be used as plane fuel?

832
00:57:09,965 --> 00:57:11,566
That could work, couldn't it?

833
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,068
It's worth a try, right?

834
00:57:14,102 --> 00:57:16,004
Shit, the fuel valve is outside.

835
00:57:16,137 --> 00:57:18,039
It's on top of the wing.

836
00:57:20,842 --> 00:57:23,612
Okay, I'll climb up,
you pass me the bottles.

837
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:26,081
- No.
- It'll give us time, Sara.

838
00:57:26,214 --> 00:57:28,250
Come on, grab the yoke.
[groans]

839
00:57:28,383 --> 00:57:30,118
Absolutely not.

00:57:33,588 --> 00:57:34,623
Couldn't I do it?

842
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:35,724
No.

843
00:57:35,857 --> 00:57:37,292
I think I could do it.

844
00:57:37,425 --> 00:57:39,894
It was a stupid idea.
It's not worth it.

845
00:57:42,697 --> 00:57:44,332
I actually think it might be.

846
00:57:57,946 --> 00:57:59,780
With this, we have five.

847
00:58:02,717 --> 00:58:03,985
[Jackson sighs]

848
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:09,291
There's a bar on top of the door
that you could use to climb up.

849
00:58:12,894 --> 00:58:14,129
Sara...

You got this, Sara.

I need another bottle, quick.

Oh, my God.
Sara, there's an island.

01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,736
- [Jackson] Is that an island?
- I can't hear you!

883
01:03:22,203 --> 01:03:23,939
Give me another bottle.

884
01:03:24,073 --> 01:03:25,874
I can't hold on much more.

885
01:03:26,608 --> 01:03:29,444
[Jackson] We only got
one more to go after that.

That's it, Sara.
We're out of bottles.

01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:56,671
Get back in.

You're a genius.

[both laughing]

902
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:43,085
- Sara, I think I saw an island.
- What?

903
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:45,553
- An island.
- What, like Rodrigues?

904
01:04:45,687 --> 01:04:48,991
No, it was tiny, but I think
it was enough to land on.

905
01:04:49,457 --> 01:04:52,961
You think? Because, well,
if you're not sure,

906
01:04:53,095 --> 01:04:55,196
then we should really
just keep going, right?

907
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:56,899
I have a feeling
we should turn around.

908
01:04:57,032 --> 01:04:59,300
- I think it might be our only chance.
- Yeah?

909
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:01,269
We still don't have much fuel.

910
01:05:01,402 --> 01:05:04,505
So if we turn around,
that's it, no going back.

911
01:05:20,155 --> 01:05:21,756
I think we should turn around.

01:05:22,223 --> 01:05:23,524
I trust you.

a little more.

We're retracing our path.

919
01:06:09,238 --> 01:06:11,606
We saw an island
a few minutes ago to the...

920
01:06:11,739 --> 01:06:13,108
- What direction?
- North.

921
01:06:13,242 --> 01:06:14,742
To the north.

922
01:06:15,376 --> 01:06:16,845
I hope you can hear this.

923
01:07:45,133 --> 01:07:47,535
That's five minutes.
I don't see anything.

924
01:07:48,237 --> 01:07:51,807
It has to be here. It's here.
Where are you?

This can't be it.
This can't be it.

I don't want this to be it.

we can glide for?

Jackson, I'm so sorry.

01:09:06,982 --> 01:09:08,116
For what?

939
01:09:10,419 --> 01:09:13,155
For everything. For leaving.

940
01:09:13,889 --> 01:09:15,824
If I hadn't left,
we would never be here.

941

No, Sara, don't be stupid.
Of course you left.

01:09:21,562 --> 01:09:22,998
I'm sorry.

943
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:25,766
I should have listened to you.

944
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:28,736
I should have just listened
to what you needed.

945
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,206
I was being selfish.

946

We both were.

Why do you hate
saying goodbye so much?

949
01:09:44,987 --> 01:09:48,223
Honestly, I think
I'm terrified because...

Ah!

01:10:04,505 --> 01:10:06,574
You were right! Oh, my...

955
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,477
- Jackson! Oh.
- [groans]

956
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:10,812
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, shit.

957
01:10:11,246 --> 01:10:13,714
Oh, my God. Okay. Okay.

958
01:10:14,182 --> 01:10:16,885
Now I just have to figure out
how to land the plane.

959
01:10:38,106 --> 01:10:39,174
Shit.

960
01:10:39,474 --> 01:10:41,009
Okay.

961
01:10:41,977 --> 01:10:44,813
It's gonna be okay.
Just let us glide in.

962
01:10:45,847 --> 01:10:46,948
How do we do this?

963
01:10:47,082 --> 01:10:48,749
- It's gonna be fine.
- How?

964
01:10:48,884 --> 01:10:51,019
- Just keep us as high as you can.
- Okay.

965
01:10:59,727 --> 01:11:01,695
Samuel,
we're attempting to land.

01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:03,798
I repeat,
we're attempting to land.

967
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:06,168
Shit. [gasps]

968
01:11:06,902 --> 01:11:08,970
You gotta pull us up
a little bit.

969
01:11:09,104 --> 01:11:10,138
Okay.

970
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:17,778
It's not responding.
I can't lift it.

971
01:11:18,547 --> 01:11:20,215
I can't tell how high we are.

972
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:23,751
- [Jackson] Two hundred feet.
- Oh, no.

973
01:11:23,885 --> 01:11:25,520
It's not gonna work.
I can't get a grip on...

974
01:11:25,653 --> 01:11:27,022
It's gonna be okay.

975
01:11:27,155 --> 01:11:29,723
Just keep it steady.
Try to keep it steady.

976
01:11:31,093 --> 01:11:33,661
- Hundred and fifty feet.
- [whimpers]

977
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:40,801
One hundred.

978

Fifty feet.

979
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:49,444
Just lift us
at the last moment.

980

I'm trying!

981

No, we're too low.

The water's coming in.

We have to move.
The sea's coming.

1019
01:17:10,665 --> 01:17:12,367
It's just a sandbar.

1020
01:17:14,335 --> 01:17:16,337
It'll disappear with the tide.

1021
01:17:18,573 --> 01:17:19,607
No.

1022

- No.

- Just unclip it, please.
- No. No. No.

1038

We're a team.

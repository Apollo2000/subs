00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,715
Some people cannot believe
that a magician can fool them

3
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,454
in such a way that they
can't figure it out.

4
00:00:21,777 --> 00:00:24,889
But magicians can and magicians do.

5
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:30,116
Swindlers do, conmen do all the time.

6
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:35,591
They're not magicians, they're fakes.

7
00:00:35,592 --> 00:00:38,330
They are lying to us, they're deceiving us.

8
00:00:40,653 --> 00:00:44,510
It's OK to fool people, as
long as you're doing that

9
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:48,285
to teach them a lesson which
will better their knowledge

10
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:50,402
of how the real world works.

11
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:55,628
No matter how smart or
well-educated you are,

12
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:57,745
you can be deceived.

13
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,834
Hello, how are you doing today?

14
00:03:19,835 --> 00:03:21,127
Very well, thank you.

15
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:24,047
- Can I bring you something to...?
- Coffee!

16
00:03:24,048 --> 00:03:26,383
Oh, yes, please. For me, coffee.

17
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:28,678
- I'll get you coffee in a minute, OK?
- OK.

18
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:36,936
Oh, my heart just started again,
that's good. Always a good sign.

19
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:42,775
See, I've always had my battle
with the psychics, the so-called -

20
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:46,488
and I use that word in quotations
all the time, remember that!

21
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,117
People who are stealing
money from the public,

22
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:55,329
cheating them and misinforming them.

23
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,124
That's the kind of thing that
I've been fighting all my life.

24
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,460
Magicians are the most
honest people in the world,

25
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,087
they tell you they are going to
fool you, and then they do it.

26
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:07,258
Wait a minute, I have to worship here.

27
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,760
OK.

28
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:11,763
- APPLAUSE - James Randi is the
author of The Faith Healers

29
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:14,057
and he's best known as an
investigator of psychic

30
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,184
and miraculous claims.

31
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:18,729
Would you welcome, please,
The Amazing Randi.

32
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,357
- Here he is! The Amazing Randi!
- HE SNORES

33
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:25,944
- What did you... would you tell us who you are?
- The Amazing Randi. Ta-da!

34
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:28,864
I was born at an early age in a log
cabin I helped my father build.

35
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:31,408
By the time I was seven I was eleven.
I grew up very fast.

36
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:33,619
I am a magician, I always
have been a magician...

37
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,497
A conjurer, prestidigitator,
legerdemainist... liar, cheat,

38
00:04:36,498 --> 00:04:38,624
- charlatan and fake.
- LAUGHTER

39
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,751
You're a master magician.

40
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:44,755
Some people have said that you're about
the greatest escape artist since Houdini.

41
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:49,135
Randi has a real deep natural affection

42
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:53,097
for magic and this love of deception.

43
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:56,434
A good magician needs to be a
little bit of a conman, I think.

44
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:59,062
He needs to be sort of a criminal type,

45
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:01,648
but not have enough guts
to actually rob banks.

46
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:06,403
He loves magic. He spent his whole
life as a performer, as a magician.

47
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:11,325
So he really resents anyone
applying the techniques of magic

48
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:14,536
for any purpose other than entertainment.

49
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:16,705
Especially to convince people that

50
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:21,126
there is something psychic going on
here, he thinks that an abomination.

51
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,838
Tonight on this stage you
are going to meet a man

52
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,926
who claims he can move physical
objects using the powers of his mind.

53
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:31,430
APPLAUSE

54
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:37,018
Now, you have been touring our country,

55
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,354
- debunking psychics, haven't you?
- I have indeed.

56
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:41,981
And I think that the
solution is rather simple.

57
00:05:41,982 --> 00:05:45,235
Now, what I have here is
particles of a white plastic

58
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:48,363
which will rather conclusively
show that Mr Hydrick

59
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:51,825
is merely blowing on both
the page and on the pencil.

60
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:53,953
- James?
- Ready.

61
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,919
Randi says the public is
being fleeced via trickery.

62
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,922
"I am going to tell you what's
happening and more to the point,

63
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:07,591
"this is going to be a crusade
to try and change the world."

64
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:10,344
If there is something to the paranormal,

65
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,972
let's find out what it is, if anything.

66
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,183
And on the other hand let's not
be taken in by the claptrap

67
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:18,561
that is being offered
us, and at our expense.

68
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:24,817
I just ingested six-and-a-half-days'
worth of homeopathic sleeping pills.

69
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,070
- Why don't they affect me?
- LAUGHTER

70
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,531
People say, what's the harm?
Why do you care about this?

71
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:31,866
Then I saw Randi's answer, which was,

72
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:34,953
bad ideas can cause you
serious damage or death.

73
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:37,497
The psychic surgeons, they
operate with their bare hands

74
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,624
and profess to remove tumours,

75
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,127
malignant tissue, without any marks at all.

76
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:44,254
And believe me, the gimmick is so simple

77
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:46,173
you can buy it for 75
cents in a magic shop.

78
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:49,635
Now, what you're about to see
is a bare-handed operation...

79
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:52,680
His point isn't to tell you
that something isn't true.

80
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:57,017
His point is to widen your scope of
vision so that you will question

81
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:59,145
the things that happen in front of you.

82
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,857
- Oh, no, that doesn't come out.
- LAUGHTER

83
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:07,069
Some people think that he's very dogmatic.

84
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,323
It's always some tired person in a
shack someplace in Idaho or Iowa

85
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:12,450
or some place like that

86
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,577
who gets picked up by extraterrestrials

87
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:17,121
and they have their genitals
examined in great detail

88
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:19,457
and they can't wait to get
on Oprah to describe it.

89
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:24,004
- I'll bet you don't believe in the tooth fairy or Santa Claus either.
- I'm looking into Santa Claus.

90
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:27,424
He's a great storyteller and like
all good storytellers, well,

91
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:30,010
there's probably some
information and detail in there

92
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:32,596
that may not be appearing
in his version of events.

93
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:34,890
It is, I will say, interesting that a man

94
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:38,310
who has devoted his whole life
to using the tools of deception

95
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:40,437
to uncover real deception has,

96
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:45,234
at the centre of his life, a deception.

97
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:47,486
APPLAUSE And welcome to To Tell The Truth.

98
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:50,198
Let's meet our next team of challengers.

99
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:57,288
One of these three men pretended to
be possessed by an ancient spirit.

100
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:00,166
Number one, what is your name, please?

101
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:02,752
My name is Jose Alvarez.

102
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:06,464
- Number two.
- My name is Jose Alvarez.

103
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:09,467
- Number three.
- My name is Jose Alvarez.

104
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:12,888
Only one of these people
is the real Jose Alvarez,

105
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:18,018
and is the only one sworn
To Tell The Truth.

106
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:20,146
APPLAUSE

107
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:34,285
'I first met Jose Alvarez in the
Fort Lauderdale public library.'

108
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:36,287
I offered to explain something

109
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:39,290
about one of the photographs
he was looking at.

110
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,376
This is the actual flower
here for the cactus.

111
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:45,463
- Yes.
- The little ones. And look at this, if this...

112
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:47,590
Yeah, this is fantastic, look at that.

113
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:51,636
- Yeah, we need to spread that around.
- See, this is the one I cut for the...

114
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:53,847
'We end up spending the whole afternoon'

115
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:59,352
talking about our mutual interest
about space exploration.

116
00:08:59,353 --> 00:09:02,105
I remember we looked at books on
telescopes and I told him I had

117
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:05,233
such a telescope at home, the Questar.

118
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,569
I went back to my friends and I said,

119
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,324
"I just met this extraordinary man,
and I would like to meet him again."

120
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:15,202
We were able to go out
at night with a tripod

121
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:18,289
and see the moons of Jupiter and all
kinds of good things like that,

122
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,875
which is always very
exciting to show somebody,

123
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,002
certainly if it's for the first time.

124
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:27,715
'I just got very excited
and I said, I need to...'

125
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:29,885
I need to be with him more! HE LAUGHS

126
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:35,390
'When I first met Randi, I
wasn't aware of who he was.'

127
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,642
OK, tomorrow, don't tell
me about tomorrow...

128
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,894
And I was there when he
won the MacArthur Award.

129
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:42,480
The gentleman announced, we are
calling from the MacArthur Committee

130
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,607
and told me that I had won the prize,

131
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:48,069
- and I answered in my most intelligible way...
- HE BABBLES INCOHERENTLY

132
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,197
'Then I got a real feel

133
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:54,826
'of the kind of impact he
was having culturally.

134
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,288
'And little by little, I started
getting more and more involved

135
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:03,085
'in the investigation of paranormal
activities that Randi was doing.

136
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:06,297
'And then he asked me to play the
character of a fake channeller

137
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:09,176
'in a project that we end
up working together.'

138
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:17,934
This woman is JZ Knight.

139
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:21,521
She's also the one they call
Ramtha, a mystical male spirit,

140
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:24,899
35,000 years old, who claims to be divine.

141
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,402
Now, you must understand that
the so-called channellers

142
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:30,447
were claiming that they could
contact long-dead spirits.

143
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,158
Now, not a few hundred years back, no, no.

144
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,578
They were more ambitious than that.
Tens of thousands of years ago.

145
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:37,788
Indeed!

146
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,040
And they would speak in
funny voices like this!

147
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,126
God bless you, Doctor!

148
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:46,922
All right, I'll say, how are you this day
of your time as you create time to exist.

149
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,924
They were very popular. They gave talks,

150
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,175
HUGE prices for the seats.

151
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:53,846
There are often so many people,
the Ramtha Organisation can earn

152
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:57,641
up to 200,000 for a single appearance.

153
00:10:57,642 --> 00:11:00,686
And you're my first 35,000-year-old guest.

154
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:02,105
It was such nonsense.

155
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:07,235
I can't think of that technical term...
Oh, yes - bullshit.

156
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:12,115
What she definitely is is part of what
is being called the New Age movement.

157
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,826
Lots of people believe
this is something genuine

158
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:17,245
because they see something
on television and think,

159
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:20,665
"My goodness, surely this journalist
would have checked this stuff out."

160
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,334
Trauma from a past life

161
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:25,837
sometimes seems to spill
over into the present.

162
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:28,382
We are conditioned to believe
that things that look like

163
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,218
documentaries, but are not
factual, must essentially be true

164
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:33,512
or it wouldn't be presented
as if it were factual.

165
00:11:33,513 --> 00:11:35,597
Hello?

166
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:37,391
The Carlos Hoax started

167
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,810
when 60 Minutes Australia

168
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:45,232
called Randi because they wanted to
prove that channellers were a hoax.

169
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:47,026
On that phone call, Randi told them

170
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:51,113
that you couldn't prove that someone
who said that they are inhabited

171
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:55,451
by a spirit 40,000 years
old is a false claim.

172
00:11:55,452 --> 00:12:00,206
What he said to them was, "What
we need to do is to create one."

173
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:03,001
His name is Carlos and you've
probably seen him on television

174
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:04,544
or mentioned in the press.

175
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:07,797
Carlos is involved in the
mystical field of channelling.

176
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:09,507
Carlos, if you believe him,

177
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:12,886
is a spiritual messenger who
occupies the body of this

178
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:16,890
19-year-old Puerto Rican
artist, Jose Alvarez.

179
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:21,103
The Carlos Hoax was to show
that the media would fall for

180
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:23,981
most of these stunts if they
sounded attractive enough,

181
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:26,942
and they wouldn't really
investigate too carefully.

182
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:30,613
So, one of the very first things
we did to introduce Carlos to the

183
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:33,282
public, we made up the press package

184
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:36,494
that we presented to the Australian press.

185
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:37,703
'What trash this is!'

186
00:12:37,704 --> 00:12:40,164
We even invented newspapers and magazines

187
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:42,959
that never existed. Theatrical
magazines particularly,

188
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,461
announcing the appearance
of the Great Carlos

189
00:12:45,462 --> 00:12:48,006
at such-and-such a theatre
that didn't exist.

190
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:54,387
But no-one in the media bothered to
check up on one of these details.

191
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:57,349
They could have picked up
the phone and just checked

192
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,811
and they would have found out
that they were being deceived.

193
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,897
- 'Hello?'
- It didn't happen.

194
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:06,942
One man who's been making a name for
himself here in the United States

195
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,527
is now doing the same in Australia.

196
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:11,530
Jose Luis Alvarez is a
19-year-old channeller.

197
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:14,491
By 60 hours after we had arrived,

198
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:19,997
we had eight major TV appearances,
headlines in newspapers.

199
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:25,294
Everyone in Australia pretty
well knew that Carlos was there.

200
00:13:25,295 --> 00:13:26,879
HE SHRIEKS

201
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,508
It will be astronomical... in nature!

202
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,886
Frankly, I was just doing
it without thinking.

203
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:36,347
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have been able to do it.

204
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,850
Last Sunday, the Opera House Drama Theatre

205
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,478
was packed with a
near-capacity crowd of 500,

206
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:45,065
there to listen to Carlos and
to have their questions passed

207
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:47,192
on to him by his disciples.

208
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,862
Crystals are fossils... of long ago!

209
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,115
I know he's definitely psychic.

210
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:56,368
It's something that I can
feel coming from him.

211
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:59,538
I thought it was great.
Very sincere, I thought.

212
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,915
- Do you believe him?
- Yeah, I do, actually.

213
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:06,504
The following Sunday, 60 Minutes
Australia revealed the whole hoax.

214
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:09,423
He billed himself as a
man of the supernatural,

215
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:12,635
a man who could do amazing things.
And thousands believed him,

216
00:14:12,636 --> 00:14:14,428
making him a celebrity.

217
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:16,639
But it was all an elaborate hoax.

218
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,394
The most basic fact about Carlos
was that he simply doesn't exist.

219
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:23,522
That's the real teaching of Carlos.

220
00:14:26,192 --> 00:14:28,735
But this doesn't even scratch the surface

221
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:30,570
of just what a phoney Carlos is.

222
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,489
I am Carlos!

223
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,536
Though I had, just a year or so
before this Australian event,

224
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:39,997
actually met Jose Alvarez,

225
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:43,250
I was very pleased at what
it did for our relationship

226
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:45,878
because it really cemented it pretty well.

227
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,174
We decided after that that
we sort of belong together.

228
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:00,601
I recognised, I guess, at a very early age

229
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:03,896
that my feelings were different
from those around me.

230
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:08,902
And it was pretty evident to me
that that was heavily frowned upon.

231
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:13,698
I perhaps felt like a bit of an outsider.

232
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:18,119
My father only really spoke
to me twice in my whole life.

233
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,538
Calling me aside, sitting me down

234
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:22,499
and having a discussion.

235
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,421
We did that twice during my life,
I was surprised both times.

236
00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:32,468
I was pretty well educated on my own.
The local education system

237
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:36,805
in Toronto, Canada, actually allowed
me to stay out of grade school,

238
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:40,476
only going in there to take the tests.

239
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:42,144
I was free to wander

240
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:47,358
around Toronto and I found the
Casino Theatre on Queen Street.

241
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:50,444
I saw The Great Blackstone advertised.

242
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:53,407
I had never seen a magician
before in my whole life.

243
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:57,619
Harry Blackstone walked out on stage

244
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,749
and did wonderful things that I
had never dreamed could be done.

245
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,628
He had this young lady walk out
from the side of the stage

246
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:09,631
and he cast her into a trance. And he said,

247
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:10,842
"Princess Astra...

248
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:14,094
"..rise!"

249
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:17,222
She floated up into the air.

250
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:18,974
And I looked very carefully,

251
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:22,895
and I could not see any means
whereby she could be suspended

252
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:26,482
in the air and caused to move in the air!

253
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:29,610
That was wonderful, I was transfixed.

254
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:34,156
How could the man do such a thing?

255
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:36,909
I determined at that moment

256
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,081
that I was going to become
a professional magician.

257
00:16:42,082 --> 00:16:46,544
And so at 17, I decided I wouldn't
graduate from high school,

258
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:50,715
I left home and I joined the carnival.

259
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:52,884
I never went home again.

260
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:55,637
Now, is it possible that I could
have drawn anything on there?

261
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:58,390
Do you want to take one more look?
Take one more look, there's

262
00:16:58,391 --> 00:17:01,226
nothing in there except a crushed
piece of chalk, right? Now,

263
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:04,646
before you open up the slates, what
was the word that you looked at in

264
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:06,940
- the book? Would you mind telling us?
- Mackerel.

265
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:10,778
I was doing, well, so-called
mind-reading tricks and such,

266
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,571
psychic tricks, so to speak.

267
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:15,991
- It's been in your hands all this time,
right? - I assume so. - All right, then,

268
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:19,578
would you open them and see what the spirits
have brought us in the way of a message.

269
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,414
Don't tell her how it was done.

270
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,458
When I introduced myself as a magician,

271
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,878
I used to say to my
audience, "Good evening,

272
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,088
"my name is The Great Randall.

273
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,966
"I am a liar, a cheat and a charlatan.

274
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:36,679
"I will blatantly lie to
you, but for purposes of

275
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,848
"entertainment only, of course.

276
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:43,229
"And those lies may not be
discernible from the truth."

277
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:50,861
Randi had this sense of trying
to be bigger than life.

278
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:54,406
And the easiest way to
be bigger than yourself

279
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,034
is to lie.

280
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,802
I was 21 years of age when
I predicted the outcome

281
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,263
of that year's World Series.

282
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,849
And it was good for me,
it moved me up a peg.

283
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,310
But it also had some fallout.

284
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:25,563
People would stop me in the street,
literally, and start to ask

285
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:26,731
personal questions,

286
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:29,985
family questions and such that
they thought I could answer,

287
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:35,073
and even offering me money to
predict whether the husband that

288
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:38,160
the girl had chosen was the right one...

289
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:41,914
That was quite a comeuppance for
me because I realised, you know,

290
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:44,374
people really do believe this nonsense.

291
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,628
Mentalism can be a deal with the devil.

292
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:52,174
It's an incredibly seductive
feeling for someone to

293
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:56,595
imbue you with that power.
It's a very tempting thing.

294
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:58,347
Then you have to make a decision.

295
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:00,224
Are you the sort of person that will

296
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:02,894
look someone in the eye,
and even though you have

297
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:05,229
got no idea what their future holds,

298
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,149
you're prepared to tell them
something that isn't true,

299
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,692
that may harm them,

300
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:13,947
just to move money from
their wallet into yours.

301
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:17,742
You do not have that influence
and power as a magician.

302
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:21,122
You have it the moment you
deny you're a magician.

303
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:28,003
I know that surge of power that you feel

304
00:19:28,004 --> 00:19:30,297
when you use a cheap trick

305
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:34,718
to manipulate someone else
into thinking you have powers

306
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:35,970
that you don't have.

307
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:42,226
And I think it's very much to the
good of the world that when Randi

308
00:19:42,227 --> 00:19:46,022
felt that power, he backed away from it.

309
00:19:46,023 --> 00:19:49,484
And out of that feeling of that power,

310
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:52,362
uh... came a rage.

311
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:01,037
I want now to introduce Uri Geller.

312
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,292
He's been denounced by some people
as a magician, and certainly he's a

313
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:08,837
showman. He gives demonstrations
all over the United States.

314
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:10,797
Ladies and gentlemen, Uri Geller.

315
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:12,758
APPLAUSE

316
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:18,013
They said his name was Uri Geller.
The name didn't mean a thing to me.

317
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:21,225
He's come to the attention of
Stanford Research Institute,

318
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:24,645
and the scientists there are
apparently quite convinced that

319
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:26,689
he has psychic powers.

320
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,900
What I do is telepathy...

321
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:32,153
and that is, as everybody knows,

322
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:35,823
is receiving thoughts and passing thoughts.

323
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:37,950
And then I have the other power

324
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:41,621
which I, which I read that
they call pyschokinesis.

325
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:45,708
And that is moving or bending
or breaking objects.

326
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:48,586
It's cracking, I feel it under my fingers.

327
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:51,006
See how gently it goes?

328
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:54,217
Look, it's like it's becoming like plastic.

329
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:56,803
It's breaking... It's breaking.

330
00:20:56,804 --> 00:20:58,096
You can...

331
00:20:58,097 --> 00:21:00,724
if, look, it's very...

332
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,017
LAUGHTER

333
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:06,063
In 1972, I got a call from
Colonel Austin Kibler of

334
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,690
the Defense Department, then acting

335
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:10,734
head of ARPA, as it was called -

336
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:13,445
Advanced Research Projects Agency.

337
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:15,698
He says, "Could you drop
everything you're doing

338
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:17,950
"and go to Stanford Research Institute.
There's a

339
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:22,496
"psychic down there and if he can
do what they claim he can do,

340
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:24,373
"we ought to be involved.

341
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:28,879
"Cos the Russians have a big programme now
going, using what they call Psy-Warfare."

342
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,341
This film describes a
five-week investigation

343
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:37,011
conducted at Stanford Research
Institute with Uri Geller,

344
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:38,471
a young Israeli.

345
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:42,017
Here we present a case of
a double-blind experiment

346
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:47,356
in which someone places an object
into a can chosen at random from ten

347
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:52,069
aluminium cans. Geller's
task now is to determine

348
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,323
which of these ten cans holds
the steel ball bearing.

349
00:21:56,324 --> 00:21:58,659
Now Targ and Puthoff, the two scientists

350
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,704
who were in residence there at
the time, were quite a pair.

351
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:04,373
First of all, Targ is legally blind.

352
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:05,833
And, er...

353
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:08,794
he was one of the observers. Duh!

354
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:13,424
He has made his choice,
the steel ball is found.

355
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:17,053
He fooled the pants off
them, it was astonishing.

356
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:20,014
They saw Nobel Prizes
on the horizon because

357
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:23,476
if you do discover there really were
psychic powers, that would certainly

358
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:27,814
- bring you a Nobel Prize or two.
- In this case, Geller guessed that a

359
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:32,611
four was showing, and he was quite
pleased to have guessed correctly.

360
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:36,657
When I made my report to the
government that Geller was...

361
00:22:36,658 --> 00:22:37,991
a complete fraud,

362
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:41,954
Targ and Puthoff realised they
were not going to get the money

363
00:22:41,955 --> 00:22:45,582
from the government, so they
took Geller on a tour to get

364
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,960
publicity for him and to
raise some private money

365
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:49,461
to do their research with him.

366
00:22:49,462 --> 00:22:51,547
I've been reading a lot of research on him

367
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:54,592
from the Stanford Research Institute
and from the science section

368
00:22:54,593 --> 00:22:56,177
of the New York Times.

369
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:59,347
A lot of publicity on this gentleman
whose name is Uri, U-R-I, Uri Geller.

370
00:22:59,348 --> 00:23:03,226
And we hope we're going to see some
rather astounding things tonight.

371
00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:05,853
Would you welcome, please, Uri Geller.

372
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:07,230
APPLAUSE

373
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:09,399
Johnny Carson was THE man.

374
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,694
Everybody watched that programme on NBC

375
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:15,989
and since I had been on the
programme many, many times,

376
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,992
they asked if I could come into California

377
00:23:18,993 --> 00:23:20,494
to appear on the show that night.

378
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:22,579
And I said, "Boy this
is rather short notice,

379
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,292
"but I will talk to your prop man.
And I'll tell the prop man how

380
00:23:27,293 --> 00:23:31,964
"he can prepare the props in such
and such a way that if it's real,

381
00:23:31,965 --> 00:23:33,382
"Geller can do it.

382
00:23:33,383 --> 00:23:36,260
"But if it's a fake, Geller
won't be able to do it."

383
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:38,971
- Are you feeling in the mood yet?
- No.

384
00:23:38,972 --> 00:23:42,266
- More questions?
- All right, let's...
- What's the capital of South Dakota?

385
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:43,809
LAUGHTER

386
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,062
No, I don't mean to press you.

387
00:23:46,063 --> 00:23:49,315
OK, uh, let me see.

388
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:53,444
I said, OK, what I would like you
to do with the little aluminium

389
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:56,990
film cans is I would like you
to coat them on the bottom

390
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:58,408
with rubber cement.

391
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:00,660
Don't glue them down to the tray,

392
00:24:00,661 --> 00:24:03,371
just coat the bottoms and let them dry.

393
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:06,208
When they're put on the tray,
they won't skid, then.

394
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:09,753
I said because the way he does
the film-can thing is he rotates

395
00:24:09,754 --> 00:24:12,465
the tray and he sees which
ones move differently.

396
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,094
We'll start eliminating the ones
that do not have the water.

397
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:21,015
- Without touching them.
- He is really suspicious, you know!

398
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:22,683
I'm having a hard time with you!

399
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:25,687
- I don't mean to be, Uri, I really don't.
- Just keep looking.

400
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:34,237
- OK, let me rest a little, all right?
- All right.

401
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:39,200
They actually shut down the set
for 20 minutes or so while he

402
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:42,036
hummed and hawed and wondered how
he was going to do something,

403
00:24:42,037 --> 00:24:44,664
then they came back to the live audience

404
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:47,125
after a big, long commercial break.

405
00:24:47,126 --> 00:24:48,793
All right, we are back.

406
00:24:48,794 --> 00:24:52,380
Uri was telling me you don't
feel, what, strong tonight?

407
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:55,801
- I don't feel strong...
- Geller had to give the whole thing up.

408
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:59,721
It was a real failure for
him, definite failure.

409
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:05,185
Because Carson's people had followed
the instructions that I gave them.

410
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:06,645
- Don't be disappointed.
- I won't.

411
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:09,857
- I'm not.
- OK.
- We thought he didn't have a future.

412
00:25:09,858 --> 00:25:13,862
And we were wrong! Very, very wrong,
we didn't know how wrong we were!

413
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:18,574
Try to make a Boy Scout knot.
Really heave on it.

414
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:21,244
That doesn't feel very tight,
put another knot on top,

415
00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:22,662
would you, please? Just one more

416
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:25,206
to make sure. I don't want it
to fall off around my ankles.

417
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:28,293
- There we go.
- What did I ever do to you? Why do you hate me so much?!

418
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:31,212
I'm going to see if I can take this
rope off, it may take me a while,

419
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:33,757
but I'll see how fast I can do it.
Would you time me, please?

420
00:25:33,758 --> 00:25:36,468
- Do you have a watch there, just look at your watch.
- Uh, yeah.

421
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:39,554
How about you, you got a watch? I have one.
It took 2½ seconds.

422
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:42,933
I think I deserve a large
round of applause for that.

423
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:46,186
One of Randi's great heroes
is Harry Houdini, and the

424
00:25:46,187 --> 00:25:50,232
life of Harry Houdini reads very
similar to the life of James Randi.

425
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:52,776
Starting out as an amazing magician

426
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:55,070
and escape artist, he was a great

427
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:57,865
showman and debunker and dedicated his life

428
00:25:57,866 --> 00:26:00,326
to keeping people from being duped.

429
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:03,120
Well, the thought naturally
occurred to me that I

430
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:06,499
could base a good deal of my life on
Harry Houdini and his adventures,

431
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,126
perhaps do some of the
things that he had done

432
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:11,087
and perhaps even improve on them.

433
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:14,132
- Open sesame, try that.
- Open sesame.

434
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:17,845
- Oh, look at it!
- The door is opening!

435
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:22,348
I wanted to break his records -

436
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:25,644
I wanted to stay in a sealed
metal coffin longer than he did,

437
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:28,271
get out of a straitjacket
faster than he did.

438
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:32,109
Out of chains, out of leg
irons and handcuffs.

439
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,277
I said if a man could make
it, I could break it.

440
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:36,738
There was nothing he couldn't get out of.

441
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:39,491
Or make it at least seem like
he was getting out of them.

442
00:26:39,492 --> 00:26:43,037
The clock is still going, he has
established a world's record.

443
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,042
In some cases, 200 feet of rope
wrapped up on a chair on stage.

444
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:50,878
You just hope that the
theatre doesn't catch fire,

445
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:53,715
because they're likely to
leave you behind to fry.

446
00:26:58,554 --> 00:27:02,056
But it's when some of the things
like hanging over Niagara Falls

447
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:05,436
in a straitjacket at 20 below
zero, that gets your attention.

448
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:18,073
♪ Billion dollar babies

449
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:19,533
♪ Hey!

450
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:21,743

451

In '73, with Billion Dollar Babies,

452
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:25,455
we said this whole album
is about extravagance,

453
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:28,041
so take it to the next level,

454
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,710
let's use illusion.

455
00:27:29,711 --> 00:27:33,589
If you're going to get your head
cut off, it can be scary and funny

456
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,092
at the same time, but it's
got to be professional.

457
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:40,555
So you go to the best guy, and
Amazing Randi was the best guy.

458
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:52,651
I had never heard of Alice Cooper.

459
00:27:53,777 --> 00:27:57,781
I assumed it was a woman,
you see, silly me!

460
00:27:57,782 --> 00:28:01,827
And I said, yeah, this might be fun.

461
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:08,875
He really starts to become
kind of a pop-culture figure.

462
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:11,336
All the way to... Happy Days!

463
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:13,589
Good afternoon, gentlemen,
I am The Amazing Randi.

464
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,924
Hey, The Amazing Randi!

465
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:19,678
My appearance on Happy Days
really did a lot for my career.

466
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,933
- Fonzie, thanks a lot. You really saved the day.
- Are you kidding?

467
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:26,435
- Whoa.
- Hey!

468
00:28:26,436 --> 00:28:29,230
- See ya.
- Yeah, hang in there.

469
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:32,817
This is show business. The showmanship.

470
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:34,777
That's one respect in which

471
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:38,823
I based a good deal of my efforts
on what Houdini had done.

472
00:28:38,824 --> 00:28:40,450
He had done it by trial and error

473
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:42,911
and I benefitted from his example.

474
00:28:42,912 --> 00:28:46,748
This actually was invented
more than half a century ago

475
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:49,209
by the late, great, Harry Houdini.

476
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,337
I was asked to do a show
honouring Harry Houdini.

477
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:56,550
I am going to immerse myself inside the can,
my body will displace some of the water,

478
00:28:56,551 --> 00:29:00,596
the water will be filled right to the
very top and the lid will be locked on.

479
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:05,476
And I was going to do the milk can.
Now, this is rehearsal,

480
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:09,313
maybe 20 minutes before airtime.

481
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,317
And I tried to perform the escape.

482
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:16,278
I couldn't get out of the milk can.

483
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:21,242
Something had jammed and I
heard a crackling noise.

484
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:25,580
Turned out it was a couple of my
vertebrae that had been chipped.

485
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:31,002
And the pain was rather
considerable, to say the least.

486
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:35,382
I was in deep trouble. I knew that if
I panicked I would... I'd be dead,

487
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:39,594
that's all there is to it.
So you don't panic.

488
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:42,264
I had to let myself sink
back into the water,

489
00:29:42,265 --> 00:29:44,766
I was in a bit of trouble.

490
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:49,730
Finally I heard the noises that
they were undoing the padlocks.

491
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:53,150
I roared up out of the water,

492
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:56,737
and there I was, I had been saved.
It was a close call.

493
00:29:56,738 --> 00:30:00,950
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome The Amazing Randi!

494
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:02,451
I came back from the hospital

495
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:05,746
and I was introduced down near the
end of the show on a stretcher.

496
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:07,373
I've just returned from the hospital

497
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:09,917
and they tell me that I have a
double compression fracture

498
00:30:09,918 --> 00:30:12,253
of the vertebrae,

499
00:30:12,254 --> 00:30:15,632
and it's not something I recommend
you undertake as a hobby.

500
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,717
It wasn't a great blow to me.

501
00:30:17,718 --> 00:30:21,179
And I was at the point where I
thought that maybe it was time

502
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,889
to get out of this business.

503
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,308
Randi probably could've
kept doing it for a while.

504
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:27,686
I remember him saying to
me, "There comes a point

505
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:30,814
"you just don't want to see a little
old guy getting out of a can."

506
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:33,900
I heard that this going to be the
last escape, you're through with it.

507
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:36,612
Yes, the last straitjacket
escape, certainly.

508
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:39,031
I may do some jail escapes
and a few things like that,

509
00:30:39,032 --> 00:30:42,993
- but I'm going to leave that stunt to the younger people.
- Oh, yeah. How old are you?

510
00:30:42,994 --> 00:30:46,747
I'm 55 now, and it's time to
get out of that business.

511
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:49,333
I think it gave him the opportunity

512
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:54,630
to focus full-time on what he regarded...

513
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:56,717
as the bigger, better targets.

514
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:08,686
In the name of Jesus! Everybody
with a bone disease,

515
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:13,108
everybody with a back
infirmity, misplaced vertebrae,

516
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:15,861
bring them right down
over here to the side.

517
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:19,906
Did you ever feel anything like
this, it's like warm liquid fire

518
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:22,159
flowing over this whole building!

519
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,453
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

520
00:31:24,454 --> 00:31:26,497
Oh, God.

521
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:30,709
Let her go, that's the
power of the Holy Spirit.

522
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,796
During the '80s, the faith
healing racket was very,

523
00:31:33,797 --> 00:31:36,924
very prominent, literally
all over the world.

524
00:31:36,925 --> 00:31:40,094
Let his leg begin to grow, heal the disc.
There, it's coming...

525
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:43,306
In the name of Jesus.

526
00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:46,059
I did a lot of investigation, I
visited a lot of these tent shows

527
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,312
as we called them, and we
didn't see any evidence of

528
00:31:49,313 --> 00:31:51,814
healing taking place whatsoever.

529
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:54,985
But I was particularly
obsessed with Peter Popoff.

530
00:32:02,743 --> 00:32:04,870
You've got cancer of the stomach?

531
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:07,998
Are you ready for God to
burn that cancer out?

532
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:12,586
A man like Reverend Peter Popoff
was a very dangerous man.

533
00:32:12,587 --> 00:32:17,383
In my estimation, he was a real scoundrel.
Because he was taking

534
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:20,594
people's faith in their
religion - he was taking away

535
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:24,765
their security. In many cases,
he was harming them physically

536
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:26,642
because he was convincing them

537
00:32:26,643 --> 00:32:29,437
that they didn't have to
go to doctors any more,

538
00:32:29,438 --> 00:32:33,941
- that Jesus had healed them.
- If you've got pills, as an act of faith,

539
00:32:33,942 --> 00:32:36,527
I want you to just throw
'em out in the aisles.

540
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:41,157
Those of you up on the balcony, just
throw them over the side, Amen.

541
00:32:41,158 --> 00:32:44,996
Throw them over the side,
throw them over the side.

542
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:48,874
So you have Popoff, who's
going around the congregation

543
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:52,085
and just seemed to be able to hear
the voice of God and know all about

544
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:53,670
people, even their addresses,

545
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,922
he would call it out, everyone's impressed.

546
00:32:55,923 --> 00:33:00,010
Is that... John? 3784 Archwood Road?

547
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:04,932
God is burning those blood clots out
of his veins, out of his arteries...

548
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,476
Jesus!

549
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:08,853
There it is...

550
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:12,648
So he was doing a mentalism act, it
appeared, and we wondered how he got

551
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:16,110
- the information.
- So Randi was coming to town and he said,

552
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:21,115
"Would you like to come see this evangelist by the
name of Peter Popoff, and he's supposedly really

553
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:24,494
"well known, and he's going to be
downtown and he's going to be doing

554
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:27,831
"this whole revival thing and
thousands of people will be there."

555
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:31,084
And I said, "Yeah, I'd love to come."

556
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:33,753
Is it Ruby, Ruby Harris?

557
00:33:33,754 --> 00:33:37,757
So, I'm sitting there with Randi
and there's thousands of people.

558
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:40,719
Come on up here, Ruby - here she comes!

559
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,431
They believe this man has a
connection with their God

560
00:33:44,432 --> 00:33:47,601
- and he can actually heal them.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

561
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:51,981
Now, listen, I'm going to tell her what's wrong
with her, but I'm not going to tell it out loud

562
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:55,985
because it's confidential. How many of you
believe the Holy Spirit's a gentleman?

563
00:33:55,986 --> 00:34:00,406
I realised at that moment, something big is going
on here. This is a lot more than I thought it was.

564
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:02,325
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

565
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:05,411
God's going to burn them out
right now, here they go!

566
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,622
Here they go - right now, Jesus!

567
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:09,290
And I have to tell you,

568
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:12,877
it was an absolutely amazing
experience, because...

569
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:18,341
- the emotions that you feel when there are people up there who are in tears...
- Right now,

570
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:21,511
Jesus! Ah, hallelujah!
He's not going to need...

571
00:34:21,512 --> 00:34:26,475
Who are shaking and you've got this
entire energy going throughout this room.

572
00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:28,727
It does something to
you, even as a sceptic.

573
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:30,562
It truly does something to you.

574
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:35,192
- Oh, hallelujah, get up on your feet, let's walk!
- There is no pain, no pain!

575
00:34:35,193 --> 00:34:37,195
12 years, there's no pain!

576
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:43,201
Look at that! There he goes!
There he goes, Hallelujah!

577
00:34:45,078 --> 00:34:50,167
Oh, praise God! How many of you
know that burns the Devil up?

578
00:34:52,127 --> 00:34:55,463
After a while, you know, I'm sitting
there and after some of the emotion

579
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:59,425
had died down in me, Popoff said, "I need
people to come down to collect money" for him

580
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:03,763
and basically he had 15 buckets, and I'm supposed
to go around the auditorium and collect cash.

581
00:35:03,764 --> 00:35:07,809
God is touching that thyroid
condition right now.

582
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:12,439
These people were throwing fives, tens, twenties,
because one of the things Popoff always tells them,

583
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,858
"Whatever you give,
you'll get back tenfold."

584
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:19,279
So if you put a dollar in, hey, you're going
to get ten bucks. You put 100 bucks in,

585
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,991
you're going to get a lot more money back.
And these people truly believed this.

586
00:35:22,992 --> 00:35:26,620
Here it comes, complete healing in Jesus.

587
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:29,832
You foul spirit of deafness,
take your hands off this woman

588
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:33,836
in Jesus' name. Lord, let these
ears be open, there it is...

589
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:35,504
And as I get up close,

590
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:38,925
I notice in his ear, that there's
an earpiece, there's no earhole.

591
00:35:38,926 --> 00:35:42,512
It's a little piece of plastic in there
and I come back to Randi and I said,

592
00:35:42,513 --> 00:35:44,138
"I think I know what's going on."

593
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:48,893
I said what's up? He said, "He's wearing
a hearing aid in his left ear."

594
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:51,980
Now, a man who heals the deaf,

595
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:56,026
you wouldn't think would
be wearing a hearing aid.

596
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:59,404
- How do I sound now?
- Loud!
- Loud.

597
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:02,824
At that point, I realised we
needed some technical help, so I

598
00:36:02,825 --> 00:36:06,536
enlisted the aid of a private
investigator named Alec Jason.

599
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:07,996
Stand by.

600
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:10,374
And... action.

601
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:13,877
One day, Randi called me and
suggested that Peter Popoff was

602
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:15,629
using radio transmissions,

603
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,756
but they couldn't really figure out

604
00:36:17,757 --> 00:36:19,592
how it was done and they wanted to know

605
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:21,677
if I could intercept it or detect it.

606
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:24,138
I said I certainly couldn't guarantee it.

607
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:28,560
Less than 50/50, maybe, you know, 25%.

608
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,480
We knew that Popoff had a
"service" as he called it,

609
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,524
happening in San Francisco

610
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,901
and we figured we'd better be there.

611
00:36:36,902 --> 00:36:41,156
- Do you support Peter's ministry financially?
- Every dime I can, yeah.

612
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,824
What brings you here today?

613
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,869
Well, I'm expecting a miracle.
Physical healing.

614
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,706
The day of the event, I dressed as a
security guard. Complete uniform -

615
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,502
badge, shirt, radio, keys...

616
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:54,628
everything.

617
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,340
I'm not a security guard - I just
look like one, part of my cover.

618
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,468
'And I was nervous.'

619
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,765
I appeared in disguise as Adam Jersin.

620
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,977
And if you put those words
together and mix them up,

621
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:11,562
they spell James Randi.

622
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:16,234
So I went down a corridor and
that's where I set up my equipment.

623
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:19,320
It was concealed n bags. So I have

624
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:23,741
my scanner going and it's
looking for new frequencies,

625
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,369
anything new that's not there normally.

626
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,497
Get ready...

627
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:30,666
get ready.

628
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:34,085
- Praise God.
- Suddenly,

629
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:37,839
on the scanner, one of the lights
came on saying there's a signal

630
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,760
and the scanner has stopped at
that frequency. And I hear what I

631
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:45,222
realise are now... footsteps.

632
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:48,267
High-heel footsteps on a hard surface.

633
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:51,020
How many of you believe it's
all right to praise the Lord?

634
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:55,274
And then I hear someone coming
closer and closer to the microphone

635
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:58,319
and a woman's voice said, "Hello, Petey..."

636
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,489
'Hello, Petey. Can you hear me?

637
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,824
'If you can't, you're in trouble...'

638
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:08,871
Yes! They were using a radio frequency.
I found it!

639
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,206
In the name of Jesus...

640
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,667
'Jodi Dean. Jodi Dean.'

641
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,794
Is it Jodi?

642
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:16,379
Jodi?

643
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,340
Dean? Jodi Dean?

644
00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:20,675
'No, she should be right
there on your right side.'

645
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:22,969
Here it comes.

646
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,598
'OK, she lives at 4267 Masterson.'

647
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,519
4267 Masterson? I can see the angels
of God all around your house.

648
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,603
Rosa?

649
00:38:31,604 --> 00:38:36,233
- 'Cameer.'
- Is it Cameer? You been taking a lot of medication?

650
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:40,529
'She's there with her son Kipper
and he has a lump in his chest.'

651
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,531
Wait just a minute, who's Kipper?

652
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:46,327
He's got a lump in his chest. You
want God to melt it right now?

653
00:38:46,328 --> 00:38:50,206
Kipper, stand-up, God's going to
burn that thing out, right now.

654
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:53,793
They'd filled out prayer request
forms, saying "I have cancer,"

655
00:38:53,794 --> 00:38:56,254
or I have this problem or that problem.

656
00:38:56,255 --> 00:38:59,382
So she's giving that
information directly to Popoff

657
00:38:59,383 --> 00:39:02,177
and then he's reciting that information

658
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:04,262
as if he's getting it from God.

659
00:39:04,263 --> 00:39:06,348
'Martha Zacorski...'

660
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:09,684
Is it Martha, is it Zacorski?

661
00:39:09,685 --> 00:39:13,313
- 'Weldon Krabb.'
- Is it Weldon...
- 'Krabb.'
- Krabb?

662
00:39:13,314 --> 00:39:16,566
- 'Peggy White.'
- Peggy White?

663
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,486
- '1305 Celono.'
- 1305 Celono?

664
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:22,448
- 'Turn over to the left.'
- Hallelujah!
- 'There you go.

665
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:25,409
'She's had a hysterectomy,
she can't take hormones.

666
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,369
'He's got kidney and eye problems.'

667
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,038
You want God to touch your kidneys?

668
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,041
Now, let that ear open! In the
name the Lord - right now, Jesus!

669
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:35,753
Power of the Holy Ghost! Here it comes...
Devil, back off!

670
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:38,214
And the bondage is broken! Whoo!

671
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:42,593
In the name of Jesus! You foul spirit!

672
00:39:42,594 --> 00:39:45,847
I thought, well, I'm getting out of
here now. So I packed everything up,

673
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:48,558
I turned the equipment
off, took my bags and

674
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,019
walked down the stairs,
outside to the cool air.

675
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,230
My heart's pounding now,
because I've got the goods.

676
00:39:54,231 --> 00:39:56,900
Not only did we have the
evidence we needed,

677
00:39:56,901 --> 00:39:58,902
we had more than what we needed.

678
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:00,153
We had it.

679
00:40:00,154 --> 00:40:03,323
APPLAUSE

680
00:40:03,324 --> 00:40:04,950
So I went on the Johnny Carson show

681
00:40:04,951 --> 00:40:08,537
and when the revelation came and
you heard Mrs Popoff's voice...

682
00:40:08,538 --> 00:40:12,708
'Hello, Petey, can you hear me? If
you can't, you're in trouble...'

683
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:16,629
...Johnny suddenly realised what
the gimmick was and he said,

684
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,963
"Oh, sh..."

685
00:40:17,964 --> 00:40:21,008
It turns out that God's frequency
- I didn't know he used radio -

686
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:25,429
is 39.170 megahertz, and God
is a woman, obviously, and

687
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,224
sounds exactly like
Popoff's wife, Elizabeth.

688
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,475
Has he seen this tape at all?

689
00:40:29,476 --> 00:40:32,645
- No, he does not know about this until this very moment.
- Interesting.

690
00:40:32,646 --> 00:40:36,065
I can't imagine what it would be
like to maintain a life where your

691
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,903
living and your wellbeing of you
and your family depends upon you

692
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,738
lying every single day.

693
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,283
I think they believe there is some
way in which what they are doing

694
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:49,413
is good and that there's some moral
compass that they've invented

695
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,373
that allows them to do this.

696
00:40:51,374 --> 00:40:54,543
A double portion of God's power!

697
00:40:54,544 --> 00:40:58,297
Well, we did it. We had exposed
this man on probably the

698
00:40:58,298 --> 00:41:01,425
most popular television show of the day.

699
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:04,220
And he announced bankruptcy
shortly after that.

700
00:41:04,221 --> 00:41:05,846
Oh, glory to God!

701
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:07,389
CARSON: OK, we'll take a break,

702
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,809
we'll be right back.

703
00:41:24,074 --> 00:41:26,868
Oh, OK, I'll see what I can do, all right,

704
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:29,830
here we go. Wait, I'll do
a Jackie Gleason here.

705
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:35,585
Yeah, I don't know, hmm.

706
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:37,839
I'll do a plie at the bar, OK?

707
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:42,593
Oh, no, I don't bend that way any more!

708
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:45,012
It has been said many times
when you're in love,

709
00:41:45,013 --> 00:41:46,513
you want to tell the world.

710
00:41:46,514 --> 00:41:48,515
Maybe it will work, I don't know.

711
00:41:48,516 --> 00:41:51,102
And James Randi is in love with the truth.

712
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:02,071
The so-called psychics and the other
charlatans are making money at our

713
00:42:02,072 --> 00:42:05,575
expense and we have to bear
some of the blame for it,

714
00:42:05,576 --> 00:42:08,786
so let's get to work and
do something about it.

715
00:42:08,787 --> 00:42:11,080
I'll take two eight-by-tens.

716
00:42:11,081 --> 00:42:14,667
The man that puts the fear of
God into all those psychics,

717
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:17,046
The Amazing Randi!

718
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:23,718
James Randi isn't just about being
sceptical of the paranormal.

719
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:27,306
He is about promoting a
scientific worldview.

720
00:42:27,307 --> 00:42:31,935
Science has created and shaped much
of the world in which we live.

721
00:42:31,936 --> 00:42:36,983
But constant vigilance
can never be relaxed.

722
00:42:39,986 --> 00:42:42,780
You want people to be educated,
you want to go out and

723
00:42:42,781 --> 00:42:45,866
shake these people and say,
"Listen to me, listen to me."

724
00:42:45,867 --> 00:42:50,204
The Million-Dollar Challenge
is real, ladies and gentlemen.

725
00:42:50,205 --> 00:42:54,751
Why is there not a line-up outside
this organisation right now

726
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:59,214
on the street? Why isn't Uri Geller here?

727
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:01,800
Really pull, come on, make it tight.

728
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:04,302
OK, I need... I need this chair.

729
00:43:04,303 --> 00:43:06,555
Sir, would you take the
chair and pull it up front?

730
00:43:13,688 --> 00:43:16,357
- I got an old one!
- First edition. Yes!

731
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:19,651
The amount that he travels

732
00:43:19,652 --> 00:43:22,780
and the amount of people
that he engages with,

733
00:43:22,781 --> 00:43:27,284
he has genuinely changed thousands
and thousands of people's lives

734
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:28,829
by opening their eyes.

735
00:43:35,335 --> 00:43:39,672
I've got to bring my camera down
here and get some shots of it, too.

736
00:43:39,673 --> 00:43:41,800
Just to make Jose crazy.

737
00:43:43,218 --> 00:43:45,887
Is he on your mind?

738
00:43:45,888 --> 00:43:47,722
Always!

739
00:43:47,723 --> 00:43:49,141
Every minute.

740
00:43:50,935 --> 00:43:53,145
Every minute, because he's not here.

741
00:44:08,995 --> 00:44:12,581
Sometimes I think... what
an odd couple we make.

742
00:44:12,582 --> 00:44:17,211
He's very rational and very much driven

743
00:44:17,212 --> 00:44:21,090
by the sceptic thinking and all of that.

744
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:26,262
And sometimes I feel I'm a little
bit or a lot of the opposite.

745
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:29,725
And somehow we have managed
to build a life together.

746
00:44:31,226 --> 00:44:34,605
And I like it. I like the fact
that we are completely opposites.

747
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:51,705
Randi's always been supportive
of my career and my persona.

748
00:44:51,706 --> 00:44:55,001
All the way through. From the
moment we met up to now.

749
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,880
It's just an amazing...

750
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:04,135
No pun intended... life,

751
00:45:04,136 --> 00:45:05,929
being with him.

752
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:10,267
I cannot imagine my life without him.

753
00:45:17,691 --> 00:45:22,153
OK, so just let me know as
soon as you leave the airport.

754
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:24,447
OK, bye.

755
00:45:24,448 --> 00:45:27,493
He said they are waiting for luggage.

756
00:45:30,621 --> 00:45:31,998
So...

757
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:37,629
People find it funny
that I call him Amazing!

758
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,174
But I like to call him Amazing.

759
00:45:50,058 --> 00:45:52,519
I'm a bit tired, you know that?

760
00:45:55,188 --> 00:45:58,274
Oh, it's so good to be back.

761
00:45:58,275 --> 00:46:01,944
So good to have you back, Amazing.

762
00:46:01,945 --> 00:46:04,530
Good to be here after all that travel.

763
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:08,451
- So good to have you back, Amazing.
- Now I gotta show you something.
- Yes.

764
00:46:08,452 --> 00:46:10,745
As you can see, I got a new cane.

765
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:13,373
Yes, oh!

766
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:16,334
Yes, and you've got to get the
full effect of it now. You ready?

767
00:46:16,335 --> 00:46:18,920
OK, let me see. That's
pretty awesome, Amazing.

768
00:46:18,921 --> 00:46:22,299
This was given to me by CICAP and Massimo.

769
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,176
Oh, oh, nice.

770
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:26,136
Oh, I remember this place.

771
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:28,139
Yeah, we used to live here.

772
00:46:30,016 --> 00:46:33,936
- We are cute, aren't we?
- Yup, we are.

773
00:46:33,937 --> 00:46:37,357
- It's a good picture.
- I love that picture.

774
00:46:39,818 --> 00:46:44,947
This is the guy that left his
home at 17 to join a circus

775
00:46:44,948 --> 00:46:50,119
and go through all the crazy stories

776
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,039
that he has lived.

777
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,211
- Ooh, the inside of this one is icky.
- Well, then take it out.
- No, no.

778
00:46:58,212 --> 00:47:02,674
- There's lots that can be saved here.
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes.

779
00:47:02,675 --> 00:47:06,095
- I'll take it out later, then.
- You probably will.

780
00:47:07,555 --> 00:47:09,306
'It's quite an amazing ride

781
00:47:09,307 --> 00:47:14,520
'and I just feel very privileged
to have been part of it.'

782
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:29,369
Once more, let me hold it here gently.

783
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:36,209
I'm not even touching it and it's...

784
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,545
Look, you see, it's plastic.

785
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:44,634
When Geller was on the Tonight
Show and Randi had helped Johnny

786
00:47:44,635 --> 00:47:47,846
set it up such that he would not
be able to perform his tricks,

787
00:47:47,847 --> 00:47:50,849
it sure looked like that was
the end of Geller's career.

788
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:54,436
Over, done, three strikes
and you're out - gone! No!

789
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:56,563
Two days later, he's on
the Merv Griffin Show.

790
00:47:56,564 --> 00:47:58,774
And all I'm saying is "bend".

791
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,401
Bend, bend.

792
00:48:01,402 --> 00:48:03,487
OK, look, can you see it?

793
00:48:03,488 --> 00:48:06,990
- I mean, it's bent, you know.
- That is a very bent key.

794
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:11,579
Now what happens, it's an energy
that leaves my mind, nothing to do

795
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:16,250
with my finger, penetrates the metal
and alters the molecular structure.

796
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:20,838
Now, instead of bend, I say to
the broken watches, "Work!"

797
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:24,550
- AUDIENCE:
- One, two, three. Work! Work!

798
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:28,554
- Just a second. It's working!
- Oh, my goodness, it's working.

799
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:31,975
Your mother's watch is working.
Is that like a miracle?

800
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:34,519
They all started, they're working!

801
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,105
The "I Am Not A Crook" watch.

802
00:48:37,106 --> 00:48:39,274
First of all, I was born with this.

803
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:41,484
When I was four years
old I was eating soup -

804
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,111
and that's four years old -

805
00:48:43,112 --> 00:48:45,405
and suddenly the spoon
started bending in my hands!

806
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:49,326
Now, Geller probably became
the first superstar psychic

807
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:53,747
to be apparently accepted by
science and by scientists.

808
00:48:53,748 --> 00:48:57,668
Uri has subjected himself or has
been subjected to some scientific

809
00:48:57,669 --> 00:49:02,047
study, what they call cheat-proof,
under rigid controlled conditions.

810
00:49:02,048 --> 00:49:05,051
I want to tell you this,
that this is not a trick.

811
00:49:05,052 --> 00:49:09,263
These are scientists who are
putting their whole life at stake

812
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:12,183
in validating these powers.

813
00:49:12,184 --> 00:49:14,852
Randi was very upset by Geller's

814
00:49:14,853 --> 00:49:18,189
using trickery to deceive scientists.

815
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,025
He thought that that was very immoral

816
00:49:21,026 --> 00:49:25,864
and he felt that this was a
prostitution of his beloved magic.

817
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:28,158
Randi, you've been going
around the country,

818
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:31,578
somewhat as Houdini used to in
the past, trying to debunk those

819
00:49:31,579 --> 00:49:33,622
who say that it's psychic power.

820
00:49:33,623 --> 00:49:38,043
You say it's magic. This is my house key.
Uri Geller took it.

821
00:49:38,044 --> 00:49:41,463
He went like this with it, with his
finger, that's all, no pressure,

822
00:49:41,464 --> 00:49:44,299
and the key bent, you can see that,

823
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,219
and I've carried it around because
I found that I'm a believer now.

824
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,265
Here is my identical key.
Touch it and make it bend.

825
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:54,143
Would you hold the end of it very
lightly in between your fingers,

826
00:49:54,144 --> 00:49:55,978
Barbara, and I'm just going to stroke it.

827
00:49:55,979 --> 00:49:59,315
- Now, I'm not putting enough pressure
on it to bend it? - No. - OK.

828
00:49:59,316 --> 00:50:01,651
Will you show it to the camera, please?

829
00:50:01,652 --> 00:50:04,821
Now, is it bent as much as this key or not?

830
00:50:04,822 --> 00:50:07,240
Are you going to keep
this key too, Barbara?

831
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:08,741
APPLAUSE

832
00:50:08,742 --> 00:50:11,244
In one way I almost followed
Geller around the country

833
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:13,663
because if he appeared on some major show,

834
00:50:13,664 --> 00:50:17,542
I simply went on the show
and did his same routine.

835
00:50:17,543 --> 00:50:19,961
Now, when Mr Geller does
this, he says, "Bend".

836
00:50:19,962 --> 00:50:21,755
I don't say that, I say, "Broccoli,"

837
00:50:21,756 --> 00:50:24,633
because it's a simple conjuring
trick that used to be on the back

838
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:27,052
of the Cornflake boxes when I was a kid.

839
00:50:27,053 --> 00:50:30,305
Heavens to Betsy, look at that.
Would you say that key is bent?

840
00:50:30,306 --> 00:50:32,224
I decided to write a book about him.

841
00:50:32,225 --> 00:50:34,685
I wrote a book, The Truth About Uri Geller,

842
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:39,231
that hit the market when the
interest in Geller was at its peak.

843
00:50:39,232 --> 00:50:43,152
The psychokinetic energy melts the
molecular structure of the metal.

844
00:50:43,153 --> 00:50:45,030
It seems to be... Oh, my!

845
00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:50,243
- I want it to bend, I just say "bend".
- Oh, my God!

846
00:50:50,244 --> 00:50:52,204
SHE SCREAMS

847
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:55,582
THEY SCREAM

848
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:58,251
Randi and Geller just went back
and forth like gladiators.

849
00:50:58,252 --> 00:51:00,795
- It was fun to watch.
- Can you do the spoon-bending trick?

850
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:03,049
Does Dolly Parton sleep on her back?

851
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:07,094
There's no heat at all. Touch it.

852
00:51:07,095 --> 00:51:09,471
They wrote that I have laser
beams in my buckle belt

853
00:51:09,472 --> 00:51:11,348
and with that, I bend keys.

854
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:14,560
Look at this. You can actually see
it bending over and turning liquid,

855
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:16,103
right in front of your eyes.

856
00:51:16,104 --> 00:51:18,814
These things used to be on the
back of Cornflake boxes, Larry,

857
00:51:18,815 --> 00:51:21,650
but apparently some scientists
either don't eat Cornflakes or

858
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:23,485
they don't read the back of the box.

859
00:51:23,486 --> 00:51:28,158
This is my trademark and you will
NOT find it on any cereal box.

860
00:51:29,409 --> 00:51:32,078
- How did you do that?
- Very well, I thought.

861
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,371
It's sleight of hand.

862
00:51:33,372 --> 00:51:35,915
To explain the tricks to you
would give you one solution,

863
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:38,042
but it wouldn't give you
all of the solutions.

864
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:40,962
'In many cases, if not most
cases, I simply went on the show

865
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:42,631
'and did his same routine.'

866
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:47,594
But then I would get the
MC sometimes saying,

867
00:51:47,595 --> 00:51:50,347
"Oh, yes, well, it's all very
well for magicians to do this,

868
00:51:50,348 --> 00:51:52,807
"but Mr Geller doesn't use magic tricks."

869
00:51:52,808 --> 00:51:55,227
But what about the people who
DO come up with the cards?

870
00:51:55,228 --> 00:51:57,437
Do you hear about the times
they don't come up with them?

871
00:51:57,438 --> 00:52:00,274
Do you know that Uri Geller did
100 tests with sealed envelopes?

872
00:52:00,275 --> 00:52:01,483
You think it's all fake?

873
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:04,361
What is the difference between what
I did and what Uri Geller did?

874
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:06,489
Is, uh... because, uh...

875
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:12,286
Well, I guess I really don't have a...
a... a real answer.

876
00:52:12,287 --> 00:52:16,499
Because magicians can duplicate
some of these things with trickery

877
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,753
does not mean that genuine
psychics do it with trickery.

878
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:23,840
Anyone can imitate the Mona Lisa,

879
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:26,342
but that does not make
them Leonardo da Vinci.

880
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,304
You people remember that.

881
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:36,144
Magicians say, "No, nonsense,
I duped the scientists."

882
00:52:36,145 --> 00:52:39,856
They say I fooled them.
They always find loopholes.

883
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:41,274
I challenge them and tell them,

884
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:43,902
"Look, why don't you go
and do it in a laboratory

885
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,697
"the way I was tested?"

886
00:52:49,993 --> 00:52:53,328
My opinion has always been
that parapsychologists,

887
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:55,748
no matter how well funded,

888
00:52:55,749 --> 00:52:58,292
would not be able to properly judge

889
00:52:58,293 --> 00:53:02,380
where someone has set out to
purposefully deceive them.

890
00:53:02,381 --> 00:53:06,759
And I had come to the conclusion
that the only way to show them

891
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,306
would be to perpetrate an outright
hoax by introducing some tricksters

892
00:53:12,307 --> 00:53:15,977
into the laboratory that
I knew I could trust.

893
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:21,316
I read Randi's book, The Truth About
Uri Geller, and from that book

894
00:53:21,317 --> 00:53:24,778
I was able to put methods together
for bending objects myself,

895
00:53:24,779 --> 00:53:27,989
and I created many of my own methods,
to the point where kids in high

896
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:30,784
school were stealing silverware
and bringing it to me to bend.

897
00:53:30,785 --> 00:53:32,744
And I got so good at it
that I'm not sure why,

898
00:53:32,745 --> 00:53:35,581
but I wrote Randi a letter and I
said, "Look, if you ever need a kid

899
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:38,041
"to try and fool scientists,
I'd be happy to do so."

900
00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:42,087
After I read The Magic Of Uri
Geller and got to be pretty

901
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:46,592
proficient as a "psychic
metal bender" myself,

902
00:53:46,593 --> 00:53:50,012
I took it upon myself to
reach out to James Randi.

903
00:53:50,013 --> 00:53:52,139
Oh, Michael, you must be a psychic!

904
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,977
I'm causing that to twist 180
degrees, just like that.

905
00:53:55,978 --> 00:53:59,647
Very shortly after, a very
substantial amount of money

906
00:53:59,648 --> 00:54:03,067
had been offered to a university

907
00:54:03,068 --> 00:54:06,321
to do parapsychological tests.

908
00:54:06,322 --> 00:54:10,200
MacLab was funded by James
McDonnell and he said,

909
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:13,620
"Go out and find me some star subjects."

910
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:16,915
And that job fell to a scientist
called Peter Phillips.

911
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:20,252
We were told that there were 300 applicants

912
00:54:20,253 --> 00:54:24,715
and the MacLab ended up
focusing on only two subjects.

913
00:54:24,716 --> 00:54:27,593
Myself and Steve Shaw.

914
00:54:27,594 --> 00:54:32,140
At that point, Project Alpha
was ready to take off.

915
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:39,230
I fly into Saint Louis and we didn't
know what we were getting into.

916
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:41,732
We didn't know if they were
going to have one-way mirrors

917
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:43,442
with cameras hidden behind them.

918
00:54:43,443 --> 00:54:46,237
We had absolutely no clue what
it was we were getting into.

919
00:54:46,238 --> 00:54:50,575
I was 17 years old. It was my first
semester as a senior in high school.

920
00:54:50,576 --> 00:54:55,079
I'm about to pull some basic magic
on some people that should be

921
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,792
very well skilled and could very
likely see through this quickly.

922
00:54:58,793 --> 00:55:03,004
I might have stepped in a little
bit over my head at that time.

923
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:06,800
I'm Peter Phillips and here
with me is Mark Shafer.

924
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:09,803
The tape that you're about
to see consists of a series

925
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:12,598
of episodes suggestive of psychokinesis.

926
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:16,226
The subjects in these experiments
are two men of about 21 -

927
00:55:16,227 --> 00:55:18,479
M.E. and S.S.

928
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,733
They presented themselves to us
originally as psychic metal-benders.

929
00:55:22,734 --> 00:55:26,654
I wrote to Professor Phillips
in order to advise him

930
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:30,408
on how he should observe the Alpha kids.

931
00:55:30,409 --> 00:55:33,995
As a matter of fact, I sent
him a list of 11 rules

932
00:55:33,996 --> 00:55:35,913
in order to keep control of an experiment.

933
00:55:35,914 --> 00:55:39,709
'Don't allow the subjects to alter
the rules established for the tests.

934
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,962
'Don't accept excuses like,
"the vibrations aren't right"

935
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:45,131
'or "I don't feel right."

936
00:55:45,132 --> 00:55:46,466
'And above all...'

937
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:48,093
...you need a professional magician

938
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:51,429
to keep you straightened out
at what might be trickery.

939
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,266
It was very quickly, though,
that Steve and I tried to,

940
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:58,186
almost line by line, get them to
violate every one of those caveats

941
00:55:58,187 --> 00:55:59,813
in one way, shape or form.

942
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,816
Mike, sitting to your right
and dressed in white has just

943
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,819
picked up a spoon that he
will attempt to influence.

944
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:12,159
One of Randi's caveats was to mark
every item with an indelible mark

945
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,370
or a scratch that couldn't be replicated.

946
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,205
Something that was permanent

947
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,251
and it was something that we
couldn't duplicate on the spot.

948
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:23,087
The parapsychologists, in
their infinite wisdom,

949
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:27,884
decided that they would simply
use paper tags with string.

950
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:31,180
- 'Can I get this tag off here?
- Sure, sure, slide it off.'

951
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:36,184
We took these paper hanging tags
off of the spoons to make them

952
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:37,978
easier to work with.

953
00:56:37,979 --> 00:56:41,106
As everybody was focusing on one
spoon it was a simple matter

954
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:46,111
to lean on the control spoon, and
later, switch those two tags

955
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,739
so the control spoon looked
like the experimental spoon.

956
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,949
Yeah, it's markedly different.
Of course it is!

957
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,534
It just went down instead of up.

958
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:56,456
It didn't feel like anything
at all, but there it is.

959
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:01,460
We truly believed that if scientists
went in with a pro-biased opinion,

960
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:04,213
and the majority of parapsychologists
were doing just that,

961
00:57:04,214 --> 00:57:05,965
they would not use proper science.

962
00:57:05,966 --> 00:57:11,846
And if we could replicate what
Geller and SRI had done, in essence,

963
00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:16,851
in terms of established scientific
protocol on testing a psychic,

964
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:19,187
we could undermine Geller's claims

965
00:57:19,188 --> 00:57:22,315
of being deemed legitimate by scientists.

966
00:57:22,316 --> 00:57:26,820
We have been working first of all,
to establish the range of abilities

967
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:30,532
that Mike and Steve have because
these have apparently included being

968
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:34,328
able to move small solid objects
across a table top, influencing

969
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:39,500
a variety of metal objects such as
keys and metal bars and metal rods.

970
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:42,002
Sometimes touching and
sometimes at a distance,

971
00:57:42,003 --> 00:57:45,172
and also influencing photographic film.

972
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:48,843
We were trying to get the
parapsychologists to

973
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:50,344
break their own rules.

974
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:56,392
We were then informing Randi of the
ways that we were beating the tests.

975
00:57:56,393 --> 00:58:01,230
Randi in turn was then communicating
it back to the MacLab how to

976
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:06,694
safeguard their tests so that we
couldn't beat them any longer.

977
00:58:06,695 --> 00:58:09,030
Needless to say, it got very complicated

978
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:11,825
as we were forced to become
more and more resourceful.

979
00:58:11,826 --> 00:58:15,704
'Another device designed to
illicit PK in a visible manner

980
00:58:15,705 --> 00:58:19,833
'was a lightweight rotor that was
mounted atop a thin metal spindle

981
00:58:19,834 --> 00:58:21,793
'under a glass dome.'

982
00:58:21,794 --> 00:58:26,548
One of the tests was a spindle
with a small rotor on top that had

983
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:30,177
a glass dome that fit over the
top of this to protect it.

984
00:58:30,178 --> 00:58:34,348
Our jobs were to try to move that rotor

985
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:37,393
without obviously removing the glass dome.

986
00:58:37,394 --> 00:58:40,021
I thought that was a pretty good test.

987
00:58:40,022 --> 00:58:42,690
It's connected to the base real well.

988
00:58:42,691 --> 00:58:46,527
I really was stumped. Then I look
over to the side of the room

989
00:58:46,528 --> 00:58:51,157
and Steve was concentrating on the
rotor and the rotor starts to move.

990
00:58:51,158 --> 00:58:54,702
Here you see Steve influencing the rotor.

991
00:58:54,703 --> 00:58:58,415
He's causing it to rotate clockwise.

992
00:58:58,416 --> 00:59:01,084
And they said, "Well, to make
sure there is no air currents or

993
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:03,628
"anything like that, can you
make it move to the right?"

994
00:59:03,629 --> 00:59:06,298
So I start concentrating and
slowly it starts reversing

995
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:08,133
and it goes to the right.

996
00:59:08,134 --> 00:59:11,720
I had no idea how he was
getting this to work.

997
00:59:11,721 --> 00:59:15,683
And if you look carefully, the
rotor is moving counter-clockwise.

998
00:59:15,684 --> 00:59:17,393
So Mike turns to me and he says,

999
00:59:17,394 --> 00:59:19,770
"Hey, would you like to go
get a drink at the machine?"

1000
00:59:19,771 --> 00:59:22,314
I know he wants to know
how I just did this.

1001
00:59:22,315 --> 00:59:23,607
So I go with him down there,

1002
00:59:23,608 --> 00:59:26,360
and he says, "Steve, how the
heck did you just do that?"

1003
00:59:26,361 --> 00:59:29,655
And I said, "Mike, after all these
hours of sitting in that room

1004
00:59:29,656 --> 00:59:33,034
"and concentrating, I just found
out that I'm really a psychic!"

1005
00:59:33,035 --> 00:59:35,870
I think I promptly threw him up
against the wall at that point

1006
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:40,792
and wanted to know, and it turned
out it was a very simple deception.

1007
00:59:40,793 --> 00:59:44,295
Shortly after that hallway
conversation, both of us

1008
00:59:44,296 --> 00:59:48,008
could magically make the rotor move
any direction that we wanted to,

1009
00:59:48,009 --> 00:59:51,261
and the MacLab personnel never caught on.

1010
00:59:51,262 --> 00:59:53,263
I don't believe they're tricking us,

1011
00:59:53,264 --> 00:59:56,391
especially based on the research
that we've done in the last year,

1012
00:59:56,392 --> 01:00:00,062
where we have exerted as
tight a control condition

1013
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:03,482
as we could think of, even in
consultation with magicians,

1014
01:00:03,483 --> 01:00:06,235
to see if the influence holds up.

1015
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:08,863
And we have found evidence that it does,

1016
01:00:08,864 --> 01:00:11,741
not as strongly under these
controlled conditions.

1017
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:16,454
It's as if somehow, the extra
controls seem to inhibit it,

1018
01:00:16,455 --> 01:00:18,748
but still an effect persists.

1019
01:00:18,749 --> 01:00:20,374
Over the course of Alpha,

1020
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:22,961
the controls did get significantly tougher

1021
01:00:22,962 --> 01:00:25,964
and the tighter the controls
got, the lower the results got,

1022
01:00:25,965 --> 01:00:29,050
but their faith in us never diminished.

1023
01:00:29,051 --> 01:00:31,845
We do not claim that this tape
provides incontrovertible

1024
01:00:31,846 --> 01:00:33,805
evidence of PK.

1025
01:00:33,806 --> 01:00:36,766
We regard it rather as a provisional tape,

1026
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:40,604
imperfect, but still with much to offer.

1027
01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:42,731
It was over a four-year period,

1028
01:00:42,732 --> 01:00:46,067
it was about 180 hours total,
that we were at the MacLab.

1029
01:00:46,068 --> 01:00:48,487
And after all those years,
convincing people that I was

1030
01:00:48,488 --> 01:00:53,158
a genuine psychic, I had a huge doubt
about what we were doing

1031
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:55,744
and how it was going to
affect these people.

1032
01:00:55,745 --> 01:00:58,707
And it came about when there was
a BBC producer,

1033
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:00,874
a guy by the name of Tony Edwards,

1034
01:01:00,875 --> 01:01:04,878
who said he wanted to capture
our abilities on tape.

1035
01:01:04,879 --> 01:01:08,966
We had taken him from a point
where he was an utter sceptic

1036
01:01:08,967 --> 01:01:12,260
We had then gotten him,
by getting to know him

1037
01:01:12,261 --> 01:01:16,224
and demonstrating our abilities
off camera, to become a believer.

1038
01:01:16,225 --> 01:01:20,437
Randi gave him the same 11 caveats
that he had given the MacLab.

1039
01:01:20,438 --> 01:01:22,981
The difference was Tony took a look
at those and said:

1040
01:01:22,982 --> 01:01:25,860
"OK, I'm going to follow these,
because if I want to convince Randi,"

1041
01:01:25,861 --> 01:01:29,445
"Because if I can convince Randi,
I can convince the rest of the world."

1042
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:33,574
We were all trying to
record that elusive bend.

1043
01:01:33,575 --> 01:01:36,620
As witnesses, a conjurer,
two metallurgists,

1044
01:01:36,621 --> 01:01:39,998
and three simultaneously
recording TV cameras,

1045
01:01:39,999 --> 01:01:43,419
conditions the benders
were happy to accept.

1046
01:01:45,629 --> 01:01:48,382
After six hours recording, nothing.

1047
01:01:48,383 --> 01:01:50,884
Damn it!

1048
01:01:50,885 --> 01:01:54,847
We sat there all day with Tony.
Nothing happened.

1049
01:01:54,848 --> 01:01:57,516
Absolutely nothing happened during the day.

1050
01:01:57,517 --> 01:01:59,810
The moment the cameras went off
at the end of the day,

1051
01:01:59,811 --> 01:02:03,856
we bent everything in the laboratory,
absolutely everything.

1052
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:10,029
It's almost as if he had the Holy Grail
in his fingertips,

1053
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:11,572
and he let it drop.

1054
01:02:11,573 --> 01:02:15,702
Tony Edwards lost it.
Started screaming, started crying,

1055
01:02:15,703 --> 01:02:18,537
ranting, raving, "Randi's the devil!"

1056
01:02:18,538 --> 01:02:21,082
"It's Randi's fault that
I couldn't get this on this tape!"

1057
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:22,918
"I shouldn't have listened to Randi."

1058
01:02:22,919 --> 01:02:25,629
"I shouldn't have followed Randi's advice.
It's his fault!"

1059
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:28,298
The man had a mental breakdown.

1060
01:02:28,299 --> 01:02:31,426
It was scary. For two young kids to realise

1061
01:02:31,427 --> 01:02:33,200
that we had hurt somebody like that.

1062
01:02:33,201 --> 01:02:36,098
It was at that point I
think Steve and I realised

1063
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:37,516
we can't do this any more.

1064
01:02:37,517 --> 01:02:42,564
We can't be responsible for this
kind of psychological damage

1065
01:02:42,565 --> 01:02:45,276
by our ability to trick somebody.

1066
01:02:45,277 --> 01:02:47,444
Randi said, "It's just
a couple more months.

1067
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:49,322
"We have this TV show coming up,

1068
01:02:49,323 --> 01:02:52,869
"and that's when we want to tell
the world that you're not real."

1069
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:56,623
Randi, he's really the general.

1070
01:02:56,624 --> 01:02:59,502
You know, the general's rarely
on the front lines anyway.

1071
01:02:59,503 --> 01:03:02,213
And sometimes he's sending

1072
01:03:02,214 --> 01:03:05,592
his minions to do his good works.

1073
01:03:05,593 --> 01:03:10,264
But always at a distance, he's
the one at the strategy table.

1074
01:03:10,265 --> 01:03:14,936
He's got the vision for what will come.

1075
01:03:14,937 --> 01:03:18,066
The big day comes, the one that
Mike and I have been waiting for.

1076
01:03:18,067 --> 01:03:20,568
We're going to reveal that
everything is a hoax.

1077
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:24,699
I'm going to ask these two
gentlemen a very simple question.

1078
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,577
Can you tell us, how do you do it?

1079
01:03:27,578 --> 01:03:31,248
As I walked up to the microphone
I said, "It's very simple..."

1080
01:03:31,249 --> 01:03:35,045
Well, to be quite honest, we cheat.

1081
01:03:35,046 --> 01:03:38,382
Flash bulbs started going off
and the murmurs started up

1082
01:03:38,383 --> 01:03:42,846
inside of the audience, and Steve
and I then at that point admitted

1083
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:47,435
that Project Alpha and us as
psychics was nothing more

1084
01:03:47,436 --> 01:03:49,937
than a bit of illusion.

1085
01:03:49,938 --> 01:03:53,442
Magician Amazing Randi, you
have him now on the phone.

1086
01:03:53,443 --> 01:03:55,235
Go ahead, you have the last word.

1087
01:03:55,236 --> 01:03:58,198
I was wondering what he thought
about the claims that this was

1088
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:01,410
sort of an unethical way of
carrying out this experiment

1089
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:04,289
and whether or not it's going to
affect the scientific community

1090
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:06,124
and the parapsychologists negatively?

1091
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:07,500
I'm happy to say that the

1092
01:04:07,501 --> 01:04:10,504
president of the Parapsychological
Association described it

1093
01:04:10,505 --> 01:04:13,049
as a magnificent experiment
that needed to be done

1094
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,383
and from which the results of

1095
01:04:14,384 --> 01:04:17,346
may benefit everybody, and I think
that's what we headed out to do.

1096
01:04:17,347 --> 01:04:20,057
We also should point that that
the director of that programme

1097
01:04:20,058 --> 01:04:22,561
thought it was a very lousy thing to do.

1098
01:04:22,562 --> 01:04:26,064
He was quoted as saying that you
probably set back the study of it

1099
01:04:26,065 --> 01:04:29,694
- and that it...
- If Phillips said that, then my answer to my having

1100
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,197
set back the study of
parapsychology, is no,

1101
01:04:32,198 --> 01:04:33,783
they tried to set it back.

1102
01:04:33,784 --> 01:04:36,410
I brought it into the 20th century.

1103
01:04:36,411 --> 01:04:39,039
'I felt really bad.'

1104
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,959
They truly believed in these things,
and I thought that if they had

1105
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,880
realised that they had been fooled
by somebody, that they would be

1106
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:48,176
more cautious in the future, but I
felt bad that I had fooled them.

1107
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:54,140
So you dropped out kind of in the mid-'70s

1108
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:56,685
and just resurfaced lately,
what have you been doing?

1109
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:59,814
At that time I wanted to become rich.

1110
01:04:59,815 --> 01:05:02,234
And I met a very important man

1111
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:05,821
who was a chairman of the largest
mining company in England

1112
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:08,283
and he showed me how to use my talents,

1113
01:05:08,284 --> 01:05:11,411
my abilities to look for
oil, gold and mineral.

1114
01:05:11,412 --> 01:05:14,749
- And I was very, I am very successful at it.
- You proved it?

1115
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,460
Exactly, but I am still controversial.

1116
01:05:17,461 --> 01:05:20,798
There are a lot of people who
think I am fake and a magician,

1117
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:25,804
but all those people I love because
they do free publicity for me.

1118
01:05:25,805 --> 01:05:27,848
Let's try to do the drawing.

1119
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:31,311
'Do you know how many times the
sceptics tried to shoot me down?'

1120
01:05:31,312 --> 01:05:36,734
Do you know how many times
Randi tried to ruin my career?

1121
01:05:36,735 --> 01:05:38,903
But they failed miserably.

1122
01:05:38,904 --> 01:05:41,823
Pick up the National
Enquirer or any other paper

1123
01:05:41,824 --> 01:05:44,785
and you'll find a billion psychics.

1124
01:05:44,786 --> 01:05:48,582
Look at movies that Hollywood
produces about UFOs

1125
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:52,544
and the psychic powers
and paranormal activity.

1126
01:05:52,545 --> 01:05:55,006
Are you kidding me? It's
much bigger than ever.

1127
01:05:55,007 --> 01:05:57,467
You are negative, you are
setting up your own standards

1128
01:05:57,468 --> 01:06:00,805
and what you're not understanding is
that the key to realising any kind of

1129
01:06:00,806 --> 01:06:03,141
psychic phenomenon is
first believing in it,

1130
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:04,559
not the other way around.

1131
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,189
Once you believe, it will
happen, it will happen.

1132
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:12,236
Even you, sir, the
not-so-amazing-Randi, are psychic,

1133
01:06:12,237 --> 01:06:13,987
whether or not you want to believe.

1134
01:06:13,988 --> 01:06:16,615
There are millions and millions
of people upon this planet

1135
01:06:16,616 --> 01:06:18,827
who have other ways of
intuiting and sensing.

1136
01:06:18,828 --> 01:06:21,037
I have never said these
things have not happened.

1137
01:06:21,038 --> 01:06:23,750
Why don't you read a few
papers and correct yourself?

1138
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:27,754
People think they believe what
they choose to believe. We don't.

1139
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:30,758
We mostly believe what we NEED to believe.

1140
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:32,218
You say that Uri Geller is a fake.

1141
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:34,888
You came here and you've given
everybody a lot of lip service

1142
01:06:34,889 --> 01:06:36,306
and you haven't done anything.

1143
01:06:36,307 --> 01:06:38,934
We're going for a commercial
break and you can piss off!

1144
01:06:38,935 --> 01:06:40,353
We'll be back...

1145
01:06:41,647 --> 01:06:44,733
The public really doesn't listen

1146
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:48,155
when they are being told
straightforward facts.

1147
01:06:49,281 --> 01:06:53,994
They would rather accept what some
charismatic character tells them

1148
01:06:53,995 --> 01:06:57,456
than really think about
what the truth might be.

1149
01:06:57,457 --> 01:06:59,668
I tell you from now on
you are going to have

1150
01:06:59,669 --> 01:07:02,296
a song of victory in your heart!

1151
01:07:02,297 --> 01:07:05,717
They would rather have the
romance and the lies.

1152
01:07:05,718 --> 01:07:09,890
There are a billion believers out there.

1153
01:07:11,308 --> 01:07:13,726
A billion people believe in God.

1154
01:07:13,727 --> 01:07:16,897
You can't touch that.

1155
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:18,816
There she goes!

1156
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:21,445
This is what Randi is trying to do.

1157
01:07:21,446 --> 01:07:24,281
He's trying to say this is a big hoax

1158
01:07:24,282 --> 01:07:26,366
and so everything else is a hoax too.

1159
01:07:26,367 --> 01:07:30,163
He is trying to say that nothing
divine is being spoken.

1160
01:07:30,164 --> 01:07:34,460
But actually our ratings are up.

1161
01:07:34,461 --> 01:07:39,341
And the thing is, Popoff
got back in the business.

1162
01:07:39,342 --> 01:07:42,595
All he changed was he doesn't
use a radio any more.

1163
01:07:42,596 --> 01:07:44,221
He doesn't need to.

1164
01:07:44,222 --> 01:07:47,768
He just does dumber stuff
that people accept anyway.

1165
01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:52,691
This is water from the pool that the
Lord himself led the Christians to

1166
01:07:52,692 --> 01:07:56,279
during the horrible
Chernobyl nuclear accident.

1167
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:01,576
Tens of thousands died and yet every
Christian was miraculously spared.

1168
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,121
Randi and I once talked about
it and I said, you know,

1169
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:07,416
maybe were on the wrong end of the
business, we should be on that side.

1170
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,462
I mean, he's making like a
million dollars a month or more

1171
01:08:10,463 --> 01:08:13,340
and I'm not making a
million dollars a month.

1172
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:16,720
And, if Randi and I got together
we could come up with some really

1173
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:19,432
nifty tricks that would fool people.

1174
01:08:19,433 --> 01:08:20,893
Con people.

1175
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:30,903
OK, one, two, three.

1176
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:35,826

In the early days, I think

1184
01:08:50,011 --> 01:08:54,014
Randi sort of hid his true
relationship with Jose.

1185
01:08:54,015 --> 01:08:57,477
But I don't think Randi hid
it for any bad reason.

1186
01:08:57,478 --> 01:09:00,106
I think it was just a thing that
people would use against him

1187
01:09:00,107 --> 01:09:03,234
and I think it took Randi a long
time to understand that in this day

1188
01:09:03,235 --> 01:09:06,656

It was in 2010, at the age of 81.

1195

I said, "Are you sure, are you sure?"

But it was just a gesture of
complete honesty out there.

01:09:44,494 --> 01:09:48,790
around the fact of telling truth,

1199
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:52,921
he needed to come out publicly.

1200
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:59,303
Thank you so much, thank you so much
for coming to Randi's birthday,

1201
01:09:59,304 --> 01:10:03,808
and for being our friends, for
being supportive of both of us.

1202
01:10:03,809 --> 01:10:06,311
And that's it. That's all I got to say.

1203
01:10:06,312 --> 01:10:09,356
APPLAUSE

1204
01:10:09,357 --> 01:10:13,653
'Before, it was all about
becoming invisible.

1205
01:10:13,654 --> 01:10:17,492
'Now it should be exactly the opposite.'

1206
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:27,712
I was here in the house

1207
01:10:27,713 --> 01:10:32,176
and I looked out the window and I
saw a uniformed officer outside.

1208
01:10:33,637 --> 01:10:35,889
They were all over the place.

1209
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:39,936
US Marshals and FBI personnel, as well,

1210
01:10:39,937 --> 01:10:44,942
circling around, trying to
prevent anyone from escaping.

1211
01:10:44,943 --> 01:10:46,944
I was terrified.

1212
01:10:46,945 --> 01:10:49,239
I had no idea why they were there.

1213
01:10:51,701 --> 01:10:53,869
I heard rapid knocking at the door.

1214
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:58,416
I went to the door and
they pushed their way in

1215
01:10:58,417 --> 01:11:01,003
and said, "Where is Jose Alvarez?"

1216
01:11:02,464 --> 01:11:05,884
And they put handcuffs on him
and marched him out the door.

1217
01:11:07,219 --> 01:11:11,141
I just saw him put in a car
and driven out the driveway.

1218
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,761
What a situation. What a situation.

1219
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:46,057
It's so...

1220
01:11:46,058 --> 01:11:48,144
very disturbing.

1221
01:11:49,229 --> 01:11:53,691
When the police showed up
and arrested my partner

1222
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:56,111
and took him away in
handcuffs, I was desperate.

1223
01:11:56,112 --> 01:12:00,241
I just... I was standing
at the edge of the dock

1224
01:12:00,242 --> 01:12:03,995
and there were no ships around and I
was about to fall into the water.

1225
01:12:03,996 --> 01:12:06,708
I didn't know what to do.

1226
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:09,586
No matter what his name
is, I know who he is,

1227
01:12:09,587 --> 01:12:12,673
and I know what he is as well.

1228
01:12:12,674 --> 01:12:14,634
And he's my partner.

1229
01:12:14,635 --> 01:12:17,429
He's very, very important to me.

1230
01:12:31,655 --> 01:12:37,287
For the last 25 years, everybody
has known me as Jose Alvarez.

1231
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:42,543
But, in reality, my real name

1232
01:12:42,544 --> 01:12:45,171
is Deyvi Orangel Pena Arteaga.

1233
01:12:47,216 --> 01:12:49,926
I was born in Venezuela.

1234
01:12:49,927 --> 01:12:52,220
I was raised in Caracas.

1235
01:12:52,221 --> 01:12:54,724
And in Venezuela, to be gay

1236
01:12:54,725 --> 01:13:00,231
is the most despicable
thing that you can be.

1237
01:13:00,232 --> 01:13:03,109
You knew that everybody
that was your friend,

1238
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:06,363
or your loved one or whatever,
they would turn against you.

1239
01:13:06,364 --> 01:13:08,532
That's for sure.

1240
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:10,995
I just knew that I should hide it.

1241
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:16,668
When I was 16 years old I was at a party

1242
01:13:16,669 --> 01:13:19,629
and three guys came and
grabbed me from behind

1243
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:22,049
and one of them put a gun to my head

1244
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:25,011
and started just yelling
all kinds of things.

1245
01:13:25,012 --> 01:13:28,098
"The little faggot," and so on, and so on.

1246
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:31,644
I said, "I have to get out of
here or I will be killed."

1247
01:13:32,854 --> 01:13:36,566
And I came here to study art

1248
01:13:36,567 --> 01:13:39,236
and I started seeing like, wow.

1249
01:13:39,237 --> 01:13:43,741
I don't have to be like, you know, who
is looking at me? I have to hide.

1250
01:13:43,742 --> 01:13:47,204
But still it stays in your brain,

1251
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:50,375
that in order to survive,
I needed to pretend.

1252
01:13:52,086 --> 01:13:56,424
But I just didn't have any
way to stay in this country.

1253
01:13:57,677 --> 01:14:00,429
And then I met Randi.

1254
01:14:03,267 --> 01:14:07,313
So, I actually found someone
who got a name for me...

1255
01:14:09,941 --> 01:14:14,279
...and they told me that
this person was deceased,

1256
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,700
and that this name didn't belong to anyone.

1257
01:14:19,911 --> 01:14:25,041
So I wrestled with that
situation for quite a while

1258
01:14:25,042 --> 01:14:27,503
whether to go ahead with this.

1259
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:30,340
But I just didn't have any choice.

1260
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:33,678
So I decided to do it, to take the name.

1261
01:14:34,805 --> 01:14:38,642
But I wasn't really that aware
of what I was doing, you know.

1262
01:14:38,643 --> 01:14:40,687
The thing snowballed.

1263
01:14:41,938 --> 01:14:45,442
One of these three men
pretended to be possessed.

1264
01:14:45,443 --> 01:14:47,944
Number two, what is your name, please?

1265
01:14:47,945 --> 01:14:50,239
My name is Jose Alvarez.

1266
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:53,743
Only one of these people
is the real Jose Alvarez

1267
01:14:53,744 --> 01:14:57,833
and is the only one sworn
To Tell The Truth.

1268
01:15:00,669 --> 01:15:04,006
Trying to escape such a terrible situation,

1269
01:15:04,007 --> 01:15:07,261
I kind of got jailed in a different one.

1270
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,142
With the Jose Alvarez identity,

1271
01:15:13,143 --> 01:15:15,603
I applied for a passport under that name

1272
01:15:15,604 --> 01:15:19,650
and then I went to Australia
to play the Carlos Hoax.

1273
01:15:19,651 --> 01:15:23,988
And I just set off to train him
to be a so-called channeller.

1274
01:15:23,989 --> 01:15:28,827
I have lived through many reincarnations.

1275
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:31,581
My last one was in Venezuela.

1276
01:15:31,582 --> 01:15:34,000
Also keep very wide, keep very wide,

1277
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:36,003
cos you're going to be on a big stage.

1278
01:15:36,004 --> 01:15:39,882
He learned fast and we were
using the Peter Popoff method.

1279
01:15:39,883 --> 01:15:43,220
I've heard you described as
a fraud and a charlatan.

1280
01:15:43,221 --> 01:15:45,181
That's a very rude comment.

1281
01:15:45,182 --> 01:15:47,559
Well, that's a very rude comment.

1282
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,852
He did a wonderful job,

1283
01:15:48,853 --> 01:15:51,730
but, after all, that's the
kind of thing he does well.

1284
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:55,735
I am using this body, Jose Alvarez.

1285
01:15:55,736 --> 01:15:59,323
He is an artist in the United States.

1286
01:15:59,324 --> 01:16:02,619
The whole thing was totally
against my persona.

1287
01:16:03,871 --> 01:16:06,749
I knew that I was playing
this fictitious character.

1288
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:09,836
I just felt, I just felt like a phoney.

1289
01:16:11,255 --> 01:16:13,800
You know, but I have to go on with it.

1290
01:16:21,851 --> 01:16:24,062
No! No!

1291
01:16:26,106 --> 01:16:30,862
It turned out that there was a
real person named Jose Alvarez...

1292
01:16:32,406 --> 01:16:37,995
...and he decided to apply for a
passport after 25 years of me

1293
01:16:37,996 --> 01:16:40,081
living with this identity.

1294
01:16:40,082 --> 01:16:42,083
The moment of truth is about to arrive.

1295
01:16:42,084 --> 01:16:45,714
Will the real Jose Alvarez please stand up?

1296
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:52,222
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1297
01:16:55,392 --> 01:16:59,062
The problem is, once you start to
tell people that you're genuine,

1298
01:16:59,063 --> 01:17:03,193
it's really hard to step away from
that because you've lied to people.

1299
01:17:03,194 --> 01:17:04,778
You've lied to their face.

1300
01:17:04,779 --> 01:17:07,948
It was extremely difficult when
I was fooling the scientists.

1301
01:17:07,949 --> 01:17:12,662
You know, at first I saw them as the enemy.
It was me against the enemy.

1302
01:17:12,663 --> 01:17:16,501
- But over time, they become your friends.
- Were we violating laws?

1303
01:17:17,836 --> 01:17:20,547
Probably. Was it fraud in some cases?

1304
01:17:20,548 --> 01:17:22,132
Most definitely.

1305
01:17:22,133 --> 01:17:24,676
Did we look at it that way at the time?

1306
01:17:24,677 --> 01:17:27,013
I don't think any of us did,

1307
01:17:27,014 --> 01:17:29,767
because we thought the
ends justified the means.

1308
01:17:31,143 --> 01:17:33,855
Deception has so many layers.

1309
01:17:33,856 --> 01:17:36,399
I mean, you have the zenith of deception

1310
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,569
and people go to jail for that.

1311
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:41,238
But then you have magicians.

1312
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,699
They manipulate the truth.

1313
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,871
They are in the business
of deceiving people.

1314
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:50,708
Alpha and Carlos and Popoff,

1315
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:53,420
these incredible revelations of deception,

1316
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:57,967
they're actually sort of giant
cons in their own sense, right?

1317
01:17:57,968 --> 01:18:00,304
But they're cons on the right side.

1318
01:18:01,556 --> 01:18:03,974
This is what it means to be an honest liar.

1319
01:18:03,975 --> 01:18:08,313
It's the difference between using
deception to conceal the truth,

1320
01:18:08,314 --> 01:18:11,568
and using deception to reveal the truth.

1321
01:18:14,071 --> 01:18:17,782
Up until now, you haven't really said

1322
01:18:17,783 --> 01:18:21,871
anything about Jose being Deyvi.

1323
01:18:21,872 --> 01:18:24,833
- Here's where I'd like to start.
- OK.

1324
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:28,462
I think it would be good if
you said something like,

1325
01:18:28,463 --> 01:18:32,134
"I feel I should come clean."

1326
01:18:32,135 --> 01:18:35,512
- No, no, no, no. That admits guilt.
- OK.

1327
01:18:35,513 --> 01:18:38,433
I should make something clear.

1328
01:18:38,434 --> 01:18:40,393
That's much better.

1329
01:18:40,394 --> 01:18:43,147
Are you afraid of the ramifications?

1330
01:18:43,148 --> 01:18:47,111
I have all kinds of fear of that, yes.

1331
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:50,614
Fear of what? I'm not clear.

1332
01:18:50,615 --> 01:18:54,786
If I don't have to say, "Yes, I
knew that he had a false identity

1333
01:18:54,787 --> 01:18:58,958
"and he perpetrated it...
on the American nation"...

1334
01:19:00,336 --> 01:19:03,380
...I don't want to say that!

1335
01:19:03,381 --> 01:19:06,050
Look at what he was going through.

1336
01:19:06,051 --> 01:19:07,760
He was going through hell.

1337
01:19:07,761 --> 01:19:09,846
If he went back to Venezuela, he would...

1338
01:19:09,847 --> 01:19:15,060
He would be constantly
victimised and abused and

1339
01:19:15,061 --> 01:19:17,773
attacked.

1340
01:19:17,774 --> 01:19:19,316
No, I couldn't see that.

1341
01:19:19,317 --> 01:19:21,318
I...

1342
01:19:21,319 --> 01:19:24,406
I had to accept what I saw happening.

1343
01:19:25,574 --> 01:19:29,579
No, none of this must be used.
I mean, really. I...

1344
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:33,040
If I thought that any
of this would be used,

1345
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:35,252
I would abandon the film entirely.

1346
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:37,922
- No, no, no, no.
- But I'm being honest with you.

1347
01:19:37,923 --> 01:19:40,842
Now, I'm being taped at the same
time and I have to trust you.

1348
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:44,888
- OK, well...
- And I will and I do.
- But we had discussed this.

1349
01:19:44,889 --> 01:19:49,602
I'm willing to say the story
that I gave you on this camera.

1350
01:19:49,603 --> 01:19:52,440
That's fine, OK. I'm not asking
you to do anything else.

1351
01:19:52,441 --> 01:19:56,819
- But I want the rest of it to vanish, please.
- This last part?

1352
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:59,532
Yes, understood, understood.

1353
01:20:01,242 --> 01:20:03,454
No worries.

1354
01:20:05,748 --> 01:20:08,960
- I trust you or I wouldn't be doing this.
- Thank you.

1355
01:20:14,467 --> 01:20:17,763
We all spin personal narratives.

1356
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,850
And so when an event happens
that doesn't fit this idea that

1357
01:20:21,851 --> 01:20:25,062
he's this amazing truth-teller and so on,

1358
01:20:25,063 --> 01:20:27,899
then something has to happen to
that event and, like everyone,

1359
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,362
he may well change a few facts
around or rub it out completely.

1360
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:40,040
In entertainment, there is a kind
of acceptability to deceive.

1361
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:45,671
It's like when there are two
Picasso paintings on the wall.

1362
01:20:45,672 --> 01:20:49,258
One is a fake, and the other one is real,

1363
01:20:49,259 --> 01:20:51,261
but they look the same.

1364
01:20:51,262 --> 01:20:52,722
There's no harm in that.

1365
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:59,063
At the end of the day,
there's nothing to reveal.

1366
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:04,193
Because what I do is real.

1367
01:21:04,194 --> 01:21:05,737
What you do is real.

1368
01:21:26,513 --> 01:21:30,225
I think I slept last night.
Some part of it, anyway.

1369
01:21:37,318 --> 01:21:41,072
Today, officially, we'll find
out what the judge has to say.

1370
01:21:43,242 --> 01:21:45,077
It's got to be the right thing.

1371
01:21:49,207 --> 01:21:52,252
Or I don't know what I'm
going to do, or what...

1372
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:55,465
...what Jose is going to do.

1373
01:22:00,221 --> 01:22:03,473
He's specifically an immigration judge,

1374
01:22:03,474 --> 01:22:06,937
and he apparently likes to...

1375
01:22:09,523 --> 01:22:10,733
...suggest removal.

1376
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:14,529
That would be the end of him.

1377
01:22:24,917 --> 01:22:29,506
The end of him and the end
of us, automatically.

1378
01:22:31,133 --> 01:22:33,719
His life literally hangs in the balance.

1379
01:22:36,973 --> 01:22:38,641
And I feel somehow that

1380
01:22:38,642 --> 01:22:42,563
I've got to come out with
some rabbit-out-of-the-hat

1381
01:22:42,564 --> 01:22:46,275
to try to get him back
here where he belongs

1382
01:22:46,276 --> 01:22:48,613
and not behind bars.

1383
01:23:19,441 --> 01:23:23,696
I was just in a state of total suspension,

1384
01:23:23,697 --> 01:23:27,367
you know, just waiting for him
to say what the sentence was.

1385
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:31,247
It was something I had hoped
for, that we'd all hoped for.

1386
01:23:33,834 --> 01:23:35,043
We won.

1387
01:23:35,044 --> 01:23:36,879
We won this one.

1388
01:23:50,228 --> 01:23:53,858
People were really beautiful talking.

1389
01:24:03,662 --> 01:24:07,082
I'm not really sure how I feel,
but I'm feeling very, uh...

1390
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:12,547
...thankful. That's how
I feel, very thankful.

1391
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:16,844
I'm not one person, I've got a partner.

1392
01:24:16,845 --> 01:24:20,807
For the last quarter of a
century, I've had this partner.

1393
01:24:20,808 --> 01:24:23,351
We're one element.

1394
01:24:23,352 --> 01:24:26,856
And I have never hesitated
to reach out to help him

1395
01:24:26,857 --> 01:24:29,151
in every possible way.

1396
01:24:31,404 --> 01:24:33,614
I know Randi.

1397
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:37,286
He has a mission out there in the world,

1398
01:24:37,287 --> 01:24:42,458
as The Amazing Randi. But his compassion...

1399
01:24:42,459 --> 01:24:49,676
People don't know how much he cares
when he sees someone in distress.

1400
01:24:50,886 --> 01:24:55,140
And it's not just on a social level

1401
01:24:55,141 --> 01:24:57,351
but also on a personal level.

1402
01:24:57,352 --> 01:25:02,900
And I include myself
specifically in that equation,

1403
01:25:02,901 --> 01:25:06,029
that he...

1404
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:11,077
he will do what is necessary
to save somebody.

1405
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:18,253
Don't worry about it, yeah.

1406
01:25:21,715 --> 01:25:25,886
- Here?
- Yeah. No, a little bit further, over here.

1407
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:29,432
- Here? OK.
- OK...

1408
01:25:29,433 --> 01:25:31,518
- OK.
- Great.

1409
01:25:31,519 --> 01:25:34,771
What do you think? No? Yeah?

1410
01:25:34,772 --> 01:25:36,274
Randi said years ago,

1411
01:25:36,275 --> 01:25:39,653
"There is nothing that a man can
make that I can't get out of."

1412
01:25:41,448 --> 01:25:43,991
That line is actually a Houdini line.

1413
01:25:43,992 --> 01:25:46,661
And the difference was
that Houdini, you know,

1414
01:25:46,662 --> 01:25:48,372
if someone ever did bring something,

1415
01:25:48,373 --> 01:25:50,958
like a pair of handcuffs that
no way he could get out,

1416
01:25:50,959 --> 01:25:53,545
Houdini's guys, his goons,
would take the guy out back

1417
01:25:53,546 --> 01:25:55,255
and beat the crap out of the guy

1418
01:25:55,256 --> 01:25:57,716
and the audience never saw the guy again.

1419
01:25:57,717 --> 01:25:59,510
But I bet you anything,

1420
01:25:59,511 --> 01:26:03,223
Randi truly believed there was
nothing he couldn't get out of.

1421
01:26:04,267 --> 01:26:08,395
Or make it at least seem like
he was getting out of them.

1422
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:10,191
And I'll quote him directly.

1423
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:12,652
"I'm a magician.

1424
01:26:13,861 --> 01:26:16,865
"I know how to deceive people,

1425
01:26:16,866 --> 01:26:20,578
"and I know how to recognise
when people are being deceived.

1426
01:26:22,497 --> 01:26:26,626
"I can cheat you countless
different ways and you won't know.

1427
01:26:26,627 --> 01:26:28,004
"You won't catch me."

1428
01:26:29,923 --> 01:26:32,716
Some people cannot believe that

1429
01:26:32,717 --> 01:26:37,931
a magician can fool them in such a
way that they can't figure it out.

1430
01:26:37,932 --> 01:26:40,686
But magicians can and magicians do.

1431
01:26:41,937 --> 01:26:44,439
Don't be too sure of yourself.

1432
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:49,571
No matter how smart or well educated
you are, you can be deceived.

1433
01:26:58,318 --> 01:27:00,929

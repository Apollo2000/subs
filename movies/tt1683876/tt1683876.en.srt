<i>This is the village of
Bakhtia In Siberia.</i>

3
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:13,508
<i>Although it looks like winter to us,
it's already spring here.</i>

4
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,428
<i>The village is located
In the heart' of Siberia...</i>

5
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:29,625
<i>and we should' keep In mind
that this colossal landmass...</i>

6
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:33,864
<i>is one and a half times
the size of the United States.</i>

7
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:41,375
<i>The endless wilderness that surrounds
this place is known as the taiga.</i>

8
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:45,416
<i>No roads or train lines traverse it'.</i>

9
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,748
<i>There are only two ways
to reach this outpost'-</i>

10
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,551
<i>one is by helicopter, the other by boat.</i>

11
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,587
<i>The expanse In the foreground
is not solid' ground ..</i>

12
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,494
<i>but the frozen-over Yenisey River...</i>

13
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:04,228
<i>one of the largest'
waterways In Siberia.</i>

14
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:10,840
<i>It' is only during
the few Ice-free months of summer ..</i>

15
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,843
<i>that boats can also reach Bakhtia.</i>

16
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,017
<i>Of the 300 or so inhabitants
of this village...</i>

17
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:26,079
<i>a handful of them make their livelihood
as professional trappers.</i>

18
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,922
<i>One of these men is Gennady Solovyev.</i>

19
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,054
<i>Here he makes his way
into the wilderness...</i>

20
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,066
<i>across an enormous frozen river</i>

21
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,872
<i>He wants to show us
an essential tool of his profession.</i>

22
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:51,177
An animal would approach
and begin twisting the bait.

23
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,078
The pressure is very light.
 will just keep my hand in it.

24
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,620
Let me show you.
See how light it is.

25
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,485
There you go. The animal is trapped.

26
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,753
This is how disarm the trap.
 take away the bait.

27
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,325
Remove the wooden linchpin so that
squirrels or mice don't steal them...

28
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,429
put everything under the roof,
and that's it.

29
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,508
Until next season.

30
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,088
You are no hunter Without a dog.

31
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,063
This one has short hair
because a Moscow dog breed is mixed in.

32
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,643
Here, take a look at Zeena,
her male partner.

33
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,446
He is a smart-looking one, no doubt.

34
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:06,791
But he's stopped working in the taiga.
He is not interested in hunting animals.

35
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,056
A freeloader, not a real dog any more.

36
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,626
But he gets all the appropriate perks
a dog is entitled to.

37
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:22,036
He chases after bitches all he Wants
and gets the best food.

38
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,205
Have one male dog
who has really earned his keep.

39
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,279
Now he is retired from active duty.
He is a pensioner.

40
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,712
And I'll keep feeding him
for as long as he is alive.

41
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,612
Come here and eat!

42
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:50,227
The snow crust after a good frost
is very tough.

43
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:54,601
No, don't think it'll support moose
and other big ones.

44
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,331
But it is tough snow crust all right.

45
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,205
It's great for bears and wolves
to really get around.

46
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,841
But the poor moose have had it.

47
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:12,116
If the snow is deep, they won't get far
on this kind of snow crust.

48
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:17,024
Anyone can take advantage
of their helpless condition-

49
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,461
anyone who is hungry or Wants
to make extra money- people, mean.

50
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,438
<i>This is the best time of the yeah.</i>

51
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,442
<i>for Gennady to find'
the perfect piece of wood ..</i>

52
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,843
<i>for the making of his
all-important skis.</i>

53
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:43,353
Here you are deciding
if the fiber will be straight or not.

54
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,981
See, it's a bit twisted
and kind of leans to the right.

55
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,390
If it's shaped like this from the top
along the center...

56
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,257
it's straight fiber all right.

57
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,661
If it's slanted a bit,
it means it's twisted...

58
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,495
and you're going to get
a propeller-like board.

59
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,607
A good wedge is a man's savior.

60
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,713
In the olden days, a villager wouldn't
have much by way of tools-

61
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,153
just a club and wedge.

62
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,055
The wedge should have a gentle slope
and be very sharp.

63
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:30,929
Make your wedge steep
and the wood will eject it.

64
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:49,084
Of course, a good craftsman
will make good skis using good wood.

65
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,883
Getting around in these
is sheer pleasure.

66
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,396
You might have factory-made ones.

67
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,022
If you and go into the
Woods, you'll drop

68
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:03,558
dead from fatigue
after 15 kilometers.

69
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,431
You won't be able to move a leg.

70
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,467
Me, I'll just keep on skiing
Without a care in the world.

71
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,286
“Without moss and wedge
to earn his bread,

72
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:13,009
the carpenter would
long be dead."

73
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,405
True, you can't do much
using one wedge.

74
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,382
Take several of them,
and you can gradually lift anything.

75
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,976
You can lift a house.
 mean anything.

76
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,750
It's so powerful.

77
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,486
Try to split a tree like
this Without a wedge.

78
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:32,125
There's no way.

79
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,790
You're not upsetting the fibers.

80
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,863
On a disk saw, if you
don't pay attention

81
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:40,837
where you're setting
the board...

82
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,374
it'll out laterally through the fibers,
and you've had it.

83
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:49,243
A ski is very thin-
about two millimeters near the nose.

84
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:56,583
If the board isn't straight-grained,
it'll start to bend and that'll be it.

85
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,948
As they say, you can take away
anything from a man-

86
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,418
his wealth and health and suchlike-

87
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,547
but you can't take away
his craftsman skills.

88
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:39,928
Once you learn a trade, you always know
your trade for the rest of your life.

89
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,398
You agree?

90
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,230
Naturally, you pick up things
from others as you go along-

91
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,065
a bit here, a bit there,
add your own little improvements.

92
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,332
You've got to see something.

93
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,339
Someone's got to tell you something
and you will know.

94
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,467
You can't reinvent the bicycle.

95
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,637
All these techniques have been
invented long before your time...

96
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,442
honed to perfection over the centuries.

97
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,559
<i>The Ice covering the river
is still solid...</i>

98
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,196
<i>making it easy to travel
the vast distances...</i>

99
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,572
<i>the trappers need to
prepare for their work</i>

100
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,174
<i>Unlike sport hunting...</i>

101
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:33,114
<i>preparation for professional trapping
is a year-round job.</i>

102
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,824
<i>This is Anatoly Blume.</i>

103
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,060
<i>He's tending one of his huntng cabins.</i>

104
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,334
<i>Here, he removes the winter snow
so that the roof will not cave in.</i>

105
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:17,952
<i>Firewood must be collected' now
so that It can dry during the summer</i>

106
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,699
<i>Each hunter has a base hut...</i>

107
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:27,999
<i>and a number of additional outlying huts
that need to be maintained</i>

108
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,837
That's a bear's trail.
He is out of his lair now.

109
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,769
Remember we talked about
the snow crust- that

110
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,606
it's strong enough for
the likes of him?

111
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:40,946
Well, he's out and he'll go
and hunt some moose or deer.

112
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,111
Guy needs his grub, right?

113
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,591
<i>All the provisions here
have to be secured against bears.</i>

114
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,952
<i>They don't use glass for the windows...</i>

115
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:23,494
<i>as glass is easily broken
during transportation or by bears.</i>

116
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:27,456
<i>These are the claw marks
made by one of them.</i>

117
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,098
<i>In spring,
with the sun higher upon the horizon...</i>

118
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:43,271
<i>the snow becomes wet
and river water seeps through the fee.</i>

119
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:05,167
In the fall, the river will ice up
when fully flooded.

120
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:10,173
After snow falls, the
water will drain...

121
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:14,142
and the ice will be forced down
by the snow.

122
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,375
A crack will develop through which
the water will flow under the snow..

123
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,678
And this water will never freeze.

124
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:38,632
If you ask me, industry and perseverance
is top of the agenda.

125
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:42,604
Doubt if anyone would agree.

126
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:47,538
But we all agree that greed is
the trapper's worst quality...

127
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,580
which and my friends despise.

128
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,445
Can tell you that.

129
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,314
That's for sure.

130
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,586
Making a few coins at any price.

131
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,787
Setting up traps up until-

132
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,892
up until the thaw...

133
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,596
even when all you get
are pregnant females.

134
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,470
Arming traps too early.

135
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,374
It's only a few days into October,
but that guy is already arming traps.

136
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,878
They tell him the sable isn't
coming out properly yet. it's black.

137
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,710
“So what?" the guy would say.

138
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,842
“Only a couple of coins,
that's true, but in my pocket.

139
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,012
Otherwise the sable will run
to someone ease’s territory.”

140
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:37,750
We despise this kind of trapper.

141
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,359
<i>Here, Gennady builds one of his traps...</i>

142
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:50,065
<i>In the same simple manner
they have been built' for ages.</i>

143
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,220
Grandfather's traps- Whoever invented
them, his name is long forgotten.

144
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:25,638
So many centuries have passed,
but we still use them...

145
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,007
unable to invent something new.

146
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:36,844
It is April, and the weather is warm,
plenty of daylight...

147
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,286
the mosquitoes aren't out yet-

148
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,359
time for trappers.

149
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,988
Those living off trapping and wanting
to earn a bit to go out to the Woods.

150
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:53,499
They will go into the taiga
for nearly four weeks...

151
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:57,005
setting up their properties,
storing food and suchlike.

152
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,803
<i>Some will make new (koolyomka traps.</i>

153
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,469
Others will drive new paths
through the taiga.

154
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,378
In short, folks are out working.

155
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,831
Will come in the fall and finish it.

156
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,972
It'll be a proper (koolyomka trap, all
right, While now it's just a spring job.

157
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,242
We do have these large
territories, you see...

158
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,012
so need to make a thousand of these,
give or take.

159
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,786
<i>Gennady marks the
location of his trap...</i>

160
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,921
<i>so he can find it at the beginning
of the hunting season.</i>

161
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:10,576
<i>His territory comprises
of some 1,500 square kilometers.</i>

162
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:15,243
<i>This area was consigned to him
during Communist times...</i>

163
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,719
<i>when he trapped for the state.</i>

164
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,523
came north in 1970
and was immediately employed.

165
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,391
They told me to get ready.

166
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,023
They gave me traps,
advanced some money, issued a gun.

167
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:34,264
And me and my partner- we were both 20-
boarded a chopper.

168
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,068
They showed us our site
and just left us there.

169
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,335
We didn't have a radio.
We didn't have anything.

170
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,173
They promised to bring some food
by New Year's Eve...

171
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,804
a stove and some other stuff.

172
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,611
We didn't have anything.

173
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,983
My partner somehow
didn't prove equal to the challenge.

174
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,716
Was left alone.

175
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:58,352
They didn't bring anything
at the promised time.

176
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,260
Well, things happen.
It's aviation after all.

177
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:06,302
It's a long story, but survived-
interestingly enough.

178
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,634
It was not like that island on TV
where they're all heroes...

179
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,109
and catch and share crabs or scorpions.

180
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,545
Me, was really struggling
for dear life...

181
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,175
because snow fell
and had no winter clothes.

182
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:26,654
There was no stove in the hut.
Just bread rusk to eat.

183
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:31,023
Was lucky to have a good dog.
She really fed me.

184
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:37,829
Thought was a hell
of a seasoned trapper.

185
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:44,272
But when it really came down to it,
it turned out was a complete novice.

186
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,775
That was my initial season.

187
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:52,144
Was flown in on August 5
and brought back on February 20-

188
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,944
some season.

189
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,248
Well, matter of fact,
I don't think I blew it.

190
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,097
<i>The hunters return to the village.</i>

191
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:15,969
<i>Here, the kids enjoy a last chance
at Ice-skating before the thaw</i>

192
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,313
<i>May 1 marks a big day for Russia.</i>

193
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:30,478
<i>It is their traditional Labor Day
and marks the end of the winter.</i>

194
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,686
<i>Winter is burnt In effigy;.</i>

195
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,504
<i>The appearance
of the first geese flying north...</i>

196
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,043
<i>is a sure sign of spring.</i>

197
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,346
<i>This is followed quickly
by May 9, Victory Day -</i>

198
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,183
<i>the day the German army surrendered ..</i>

199
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,224
<i>bringing an end
to the Second World' Wan</i>

200
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:14,458
<i>This marks an event of epochal
proportians In Russian history...</i>

201
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:19,525
<i>as more than 20 million Russians
lost' their lives In this wan</i>

202
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:24,074
<i>Every family lost' someone.</i>

203
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:29,044
<i>This sign marks a residence
of a veteran, a war hero.</i>

204
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,343
Everyone yelled and shouted.

205
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:37,014
We screamed, “Hurrah!”

206
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,090
asked, “What happened?”

207
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,651
They said, “Yell hurrah. it's victory!”

208
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:50,291
Then Stalin spoke on the radio.

209
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,960
His Russian wasn't too good.

210
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,835
We came out into the street
in the morning-

211
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:08,141
<i>overwhelmed by memories of the war,
he can no longer speak</i>

212
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:27,134
<i>As if responding to the shots
fired In celebration...</i>

213
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,867
<i>the fee of the Yenisey River
begins to break</i>

214
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,008
<i>An entire landscape
starts to move north...</i>

215
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,308
<i>towards the Arctic Ocean.</i>

216
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,780
<i>Spring is the time to
build' dugout canoes.</i>

217
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,046
<i>This man, Gennady Tiganov...</i>

218
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:22,717
<i>belongs to the get native population
of this part of Siberia.</i>

219
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,387
<i>He is their last' remaining
expert' boat builder</i>

220
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,927
<i>Tools and techniques being used
are all traditional</i>

221
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:17,246
<i>It' is essential to hollow out
the precise amount and no more.</i>

222
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,408
<i>Markings point out
the positions of dowels</i>

223
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:23,480
<i>which will be driven
into the hull.</i>

224
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:31,259
<i>From the inside, this tells the
boat maker how deep he can carve.</i>

225
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:40,361
<i>One of the last steps
is the widening of the canoe.</i>

226
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:51,614
<i>Exposing the body to heat
makes the shape of the canoe permanent</i>

227
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,123
<i>What remains is a layer of tar.</i>

228
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,218
<i>The hunters head
out to test their new</i>

229
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:25,472
<i>canoes with some fishing
and duck hunting.</i>

230
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:33,116
<i>This week-long expedition
Is also the first time...</i>

231
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:37,023
<i>these pups are being taken
out into the wilderness.</i>

232
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,293
<i>The nets have been out overnight'...</i>

233
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,266
<i>and, by morning,
Ice has formed around them.</i>

234
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:23,806
<i>But it's a good time of year
for catching pike and other fish.</i>

235
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,903
<i>The most dellicate fish will be smoked
for the season to come.</i>

236
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,540
<i>Summer brings an abundance of life.</i>

237
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,757
<i>This is a sable In short summer fur.</i>

238
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,989
<i>Come winter, it' will be
the main quarry of the trappers.</i>

239
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,180
<i>Even though the hunter
does not want to go for the reindeer...</i>

240
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:43,481
<i>his dog can't help but give chase.</i>

241
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,752
<i>He has no chance, but try he must.</i>

242
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:22,453
<i>Preparations are in full swing
for the upcoming trapping season.</i>

243
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:26,791
<i>This means stocking up
on as much fish as you can catch...</i>

244
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,297
<i>to feed both man and dog.</i>

245
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,435
<i>Some of the pike can be real specimens.</i>

246
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:41,004
<i>Negotiating the shallows of the river
becomes a real problem.</i>

247
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,545
<i>The propeller has to be protected</i>

248
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:50,041
<i>Summer Is the season for the hunters
to help each other build' new cabins.</i>

249
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:54,413
<i>The real challenge are the mosquitoes-
clouds of them.</i>

250
00:27:54,506 --> 00:28:01,890
Honestly, mosquitoes
are all right for me.

251
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,154
When you're busy,
you don't notice them that much.

252
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,031
Here are the nails.

253
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:22,772
You drive them in, leaving the tip.
And then you twist it, and that's it.

254
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,976
<i>The hunters are so
self-reliant that they</i>

255
00:28:26,977 --> 00:28:30,116
<i>make virtually everything
themselves.</i>

256
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,953
<i>Chain saws are one of the few
modern tools they use.</i>

257
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,071
All right, the Window to Europe.

258
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,145
Moss and earth. In the cities,
they have special insulation.

259
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,813
Here, moss and earth are the insulation.

260
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:15,896
We usually do it in the summer
after piling up logs in the spring.

261
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,233
By early summer, the log frame is ready.

262
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:26,367
You now have to cover it to protect
it against rain, to let it dry...

263
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:31,140
so that the hut is ready
by the start of the trapping season.

264
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:34,706
For good measure, we'll dig a cellar...

265
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:40,347
to store potatoes, onions.

266
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:51,998
On a warm day in a windless place,
the mosquitoes bite like crazy.

267
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,570
The best place is in the wind
close to your home.

268
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:05,681
The mosquitoes bite.
This dog is eaten up by mosquitoes.

269
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,384
<i>As there is no corner drugstore...</i>

270
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,119
<i>the hunters have to make
their own insect repellent'.</i>

271
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,623
<i>The bark of birch trees
can be processed ..</i>

272
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:26,896
<i>to produce a tar
which is equally as effective out there.</i>

273
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:26,258
I'll cover his face with tar,
and it'll be okay.

274
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,291
Use almost half a
liter of fish oil or

275
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,231
some other kind of oil
for a glass of tar.

276
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,532
In the evening,
you have to go to the bathhouse.

277
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,545
Dogs stink with tar.
Their owners stink with tar.

278
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:55,489
<i>Gennady now resumes
the making of his skis.</i>

279
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,556
They make special skis for every season.

280
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,836
Even in the fall when the snow cover's
thin, it's hard to move Without skis...

281
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:15,207
because you Walk knee-deep in moss
and, later, in snow.

282
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,112
Small skis are great for this.

283
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:24,084
That's why they make them crude-
strong and small.

284
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,621
Here is quite a thin board.

285
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,978
If it were not made
from a straight-grained

286
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:14,401
wood, it would have
broken at once.

287
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:25,945
<i>He puts the tip of the plank
into boilling water for a few hours...</i>

288
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,881
<i>In order to make it pliable.</i>

289
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:33,922
<i>He passes this age-old' technique
on to his son.</i>

290
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,929
Now look, Kirill.

291
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:49,096
You don't press here.
You press on the ski here. Get it?

292
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:55,242
And you have to apply pressure smoothly
for the wood to get used to it.

293
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,869
See how it bends?

294
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,608
If you press too quickly,
it opens cracks.

295
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,654
So take this and lift it slowly.

296
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,623
Slowly, slowly, okay.

297
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,462
Lift some more.

298
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:28,571
The point of the ski is sharpened
after bending.

299
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,613
If you start bending a sharpened ski...

300
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:37,113
the tip will be here
and the ski will crack here.

301
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:42,185
That's What you'll get.
You understand?

302
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,624
The bend doesn't lose its shape.

303
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:59,202
You temper it, then keep it
for some more time in this frame.

304
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,935
And that's it. It will never unbend.

305
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,852
<i>From further upriver comes driftwood</i>

306
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:19,019
<i>The villagers gather it'
as free firewood for the winter.</i>

307
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:36,403
<i>The few remaining Ket people
earn money this way.</i>

308
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,415
<i>It's one of the few menial jobs
left for them.</i>

309
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:56,258
<i>They ha I've largely forgotten
their traditional craftsmanship...</i>

310
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,563
<i>and most of them
have problems with alcohol</i>

311
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:04,367
am making skis. have bent the tips.

312
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,136
Only don't have a jack plane.

313
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,802
When get one, I'll finish the job.

314
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:28,157
<i>Only a single old Ket woman is left
who still remembers the old ways.</i>

315
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:32,701
<i>These mysterious dolls
are protective spirits.</i>

316
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,792
<i>During day, they sleep...</i>

317
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:38,396
<i>but at night they awaken
to guard the home.</i>

318
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,484
<i>That night', her son is careless
with a cigarette butt...</i>

319
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,718
<i>and their house catches fire.</i>

320
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,595
<i>Yet, another loss
is more painful for him.</i>

321
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,931
It's a shame don't have my doll.

322
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:13,373
My house burned to the ground
together with the dolls.

323
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,960
Our old folks have all died.

324
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,966
And there are not many young people.

325
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:45,070
In the old days, we lived in tents
and the young learned from the old

326
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:49,167
Now you see a lot of that is forgotten.

327
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,837
- You see we're drunk
and we do odd jobs.

328
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:52,407
- Hey, you!

329
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:56,007
- Hey, shut up! Shut up!
- What?

330
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,980
The Russians are to blame!

331
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,750
Without the Russians,
there wouldn't have been vodka.

332
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,553
No, it's our own fault.

333
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:08,163
Some people live well.

334
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:12,394
If you want, you can live and work.

335
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,438
If not, What else can you do but drink?

336
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,838
As for who is to blame, don't know.
It's a tough question to answer.

337
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:12,026
<i>Summer In Its fullest display-
swallows, boats.</i>

338
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,097
<i>Daylight lasts 20 hours.</i>

339
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,435
<i>This is the time
when big ships show up...</i>

340
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,097
<i>some of them even tourist cruisers.</i>

341
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,947
<i>It's gardening season.</i>

342
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,686
<i>Greenhouses are being fixed
and manure spread</i>

343
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,393
<i>With the days so abundantly long...</i>

344
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,735
<i>vegetables grow here
at an incredible rate.</i>

345
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:15,054
<i>One of the first signs that the
short summer Is coming to an end..</i>

346
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,821
<i>Is the chipmunks out
collecting pine nuts.</i>

347
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,727
<i>Humans do the same In their own way;.</i>

348
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,813
There are few cones this year.

349
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,863
<i>The trappers can estimate
from the number of cones...</i>

350
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,559
<i>whether ifs going to be
a good hunting year or not</i>

351
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:02,661
<i>as the nuts are a staple food
for the sable.</i>

352
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,542
<i>Grinding the cones
makes It easier to get the nuts...</i>

353
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:19,109
<i>which provide another food source
for the hunters during the winter</i>

354
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,901
<i>Pouring the grounds into the wind...</i>

355
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,632
<i>is similar to separating the wheat
from the chaff.?</i>

356
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,595
<i>Now the first rains start'.</i>

357
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,029
<i>Summer will soon be oven</i>

358
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,868
<i>So while the river is still navigable...</i>

359
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:19,436
<i>a strange visitor arrives with company</i>

360
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,711
<i>It' is a candidate seeking reelection.</i>

361
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,628
<i>For four years, people
In Bakhtia have not</i>

362
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:28,449
<i>seen a single politician
caring for them...</i>

363
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:33,962
<i>but, here now there is one campaingning
vigorously for their votes.</i>

364
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:39,262
<i>He promises transparent government
and the expunging of corruption-</i>

365
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:42,769
<i>a clean leadership once and for all</i>

366
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,239
<i>But' he does not fail to deliver
the goods anyway-</i>

367
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:51,336
<i>sacks of wheat for his constituency
and even a little snow</i>

368
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:57,343
<i>Only the young people
seem to be able to get into the groove.</i>

369
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:05,517
<i>And now the candidate
bursts out In song himself..</i>

370
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,629
<i>backed by his cheerleaders.</i>

371
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:21,607
<i>The voters, apparently
couldn’t' care less.</i>

372
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,271
<i>Fall has arrived</i>

373
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,365
<i>It' is time to harvest...</i>

374
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:58,971
<i>and begin serious preparations
for the fast-approaching cold.</i>

375
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:21,965
<i>Days grow short',
and fishing is good now</i>

376
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:38,041
<i>At night, the trappers go out
onto the river.</i>

377
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:43,847
<i>Every type of fish has Its specific time
when it' comes close to the shore.</i>

378
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:48,754
<i>The only species of fresh water 000'
can be stalked now..</i>

379
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,918
<i>using almost prehistoric tools.</i>

380
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:56,364
<i>The light of the fire attracts the fish.</i>

381
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,855
<i>Storms from the north suddenly set In.</i>

382
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,544
<i>The clouds carry rain
that falls for weeks...</i>

383
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,581
<i>and this is important for the hunters.</i>

384
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,016
<i>The level of the river rises...</i>

385
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:55,682
<i>and now they can transport'
their heavy gear into the wilderness.</i>

386
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:33,689
<i>The most important' things, like bread
are loaded last'.</i>

387
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:37,459
<i>The trappers order bread In advance
from the bakery.</i>

388
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:40,034
<i>Half a loaf per day will do.</i>

389
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,897
<i>And now comes the moment of departure.</i>

390
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:52,938
Good luck. Come back healthy.

391
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,812
Don't worry about us.
We'll be all right.

392
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:59,649
Keep your fingers crossed
that we come back.

393
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:06,251
<i>The occasion is celebrated with vodka-
vicious as jet' fuel</i>

394
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,576
I have tried all sorts of jobs
here on the collective farm...

395
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:32,985
but hunting is the best-
just the ticket.

396
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,951
Nobody tells me What to do.
 can hunt or rest.

397
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,258
Am my own man.

398
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,834
And hunting is great fun.

399
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,466
<i>Now out on their own...</i>

400
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:23,527
<i>the trappers become
what they essentially are- happy people.</i>

401
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:28,201
<i>Accompanied only by their dogs,
they live off the land.</i>

402
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,801
<i>They are completely self-reliant.</i>

403
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,113
<i>They are truly free.</i>

404
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:38,448
<i>No rules, no taxes, no government...</i>

405
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,715
<i>no laws, no bureaucracy</i>

406
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,916
<i>No phones, no radio.</i>

407
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:48,622
<i>Equipped only with their individual
values and standard of conduct.</i>

408
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:54,261
<i>Mikhail Tarkovsky-
from the family of the famous filmmaker-</i>

409
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:57,430
<i>knows what it' takes to live out here.</i>

410
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:02,033
<i>And the first thing is to be able
to ha navigate the river in high water</i>

411
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:37,841
<i>Anatoly Blume sets out on a different'
tributary of the Yenisei;...</i>

412
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:42,610
<i>and Gennady and his son
on their respective branch of the river.</i>

413
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,214
<i>It's tough going.</i>

414
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,474
In some places, the
rapids are so strong...

415
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:14,846
that the outboard motor
cannot overcome the current.

416
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,182
So you have to have these long ropes.

417
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:23,315
Sometimes even the two of us
cannot drag it against the current.

418
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,188
It's a very hard river to run.

419
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:31,563
The rapids are so strong that you can
only cover 25 to 30 kilometers a day.

420
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:39,340
<i>Gennady's son sets out
for his own territory further upriver.</i>

421
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:44,811
<i>“Every man has his own destiny;,
his own plan, his own Territory..</i>

422
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,814
<i>says Gennady In a pensive mood</i>

423
00:51:54,344 --> 00:52:01,489
You bring the main supplies to the huts
on the bank when the water is high-

424
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:06,330
grits, food for the dogs-
and you store it all safely up high.

425
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,668
<i>At this time of year,
the bears are still around ..</i>

426
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:14,935
<i>posing a threat to the
trappers' provisians.</i>

427
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,394
<i>Bears are the real enemy
of the trappers...</i>

428
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:40,832
<i>wreaking all kinds of ha vac
to both hut and trap.</i>

429
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,682
This is a bear's work.

430
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:03,485
You often feel,
to hell with your skin or meat...

431
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,323
as long as you keep away from my traps.

432
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,691
It's attracted by the smell.

433
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,389
It knows it can't find any food...

434
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,024
but it goes in and smashes
everything all the same.

435
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,930
So you check the huts, fix the traps...

436
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,339
and you may catch
some fish or fowl as well.

437
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:54,233
<i>Gennady rewards his dogs
with the neck and feet of the woodcock</i>

438
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,021
<i>For now the river still flows free...</i>

439
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,217
<i>but the first signs of
frost are appearing.</i>

440
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:15,160
<i>The trappers rush to catch
as much pike as they can...</i>

441
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,993
<i>mostly for their dogs.</i>

442
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:22,127
Half a dozen pikes like these
for every hut is just about enough.

443
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:37,311
<i>Mikhail has his own unorthodox
fishing techniques.</i>

444
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:07,374
<i>The bears are no longer around
having gone off into hibernation.</i>

445
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,441
<i>Pro visions now can be stored
within;}? easy reach.</i>

446
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,362
<i>The only threat are mice...</i>

447
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,796
<i>and the plastic will per vent them
from getting up the tree.</i>

448
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:41,176
You see that everything
is going forward as it should.

449
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:44,445
It gives you a sense
of a job being done.

450
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:49,149
It is not you who is doing it,
but you still feel part of it.

451
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:54,225
Half-frozen water or slush ice
is called <i>shuga.</i>

452
00:55:54,317 --> 00:56:00,529
This one is still soft with snow.

453
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:03,502
You can still ride in a boat on it.

454
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,871
We are moving from early to late fall.

455
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:15,973
The boat runs to deliver supplies.

456
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,883
You are full of worry-
anxious to get the supplies...

457
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,582
not to drop them in the water...

458
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:27,355
to make it to the hut, put the hut in
order and move oh to the next one.

459
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,258
We are moving deeper and deeper
into the fall season.

460
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:42,133
This bright weather and light frost
comes as a relief after the rains.

461
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,570
There is nothing like
warming yourself and

462
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:46,908
having a cup of tea
to make you happy

463
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:50,507
it's not like anything else.

464
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:06,695
When came here, had a feeling
that my dream had come true.

465
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,634
You enjoy the beauty of nature,
and you do your job at the same time.

466
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:16,109
That's why they all end up
by being hunters.

467
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:21,512
Because hunting brings you closer
to the taiga than anything else.

468
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,757
Here we are. Another hut is ready.

469
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:33,453
Turn the bucket upside down
so it doesn't fill with water.

470
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:38,727
Everything hangs in its proper place,
and I've made the cabin ready.

471
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:42,565
Inside the hut everything also hangs
from the ceiling- grits, sugar-

472
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,798
so that the mice don't eat them.

473
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:47,340
Everything is fine.

474
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,001
Have split firewood and stacked it.

475
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,908
The food is here.

476
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:56,006
In short, I've put another hut in order,
thank God.

477
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,417
Come on, Reddie.

478
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:37,056
<i>The onslaught of Ice
puts Mikhail boat In leopard;.</i>

479
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,786
<i>It's time to secure it for the winter.</i>

480
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:40,887
<i>Mikhail uses a different', more
recognizable type of traditional trap.</i>

481
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:10,613
This is called an ochep- a steel trap.

482
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:12,983
It acts when the animal steps in it.

483
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,249
When the animal begins to struggle...

484
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:22,160
the end of the <i>ochep</i> is released,
and it jerks up.

485
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:28,133
Then neither a fox nor a marten
nor a mouse will get to it.

486
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:30,170
You try to put it closer to the edge...

487
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,364
but make sure it isn't thrown down
by the wind or snow.

488
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:37,539
<i>The branches protect the trap
from getting snowed over</i>

489
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,524
<i>The enormity of solitude sets In.</i>

490
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,597
<i>His only companion is his dog.</i>

491
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:12,603
For the hunter, of course, the important
thing is that the dog works for him.

492
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,379
But you become attached to it.

493
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:24,487
Sometimes the dog
becomes a member of your family.

494
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,617
The dog feeds us.

495
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:32,963
You are no hunter Without a dog.

496
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:38,700
At three months,
 can tell a good dog Without fail.

497
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:44,370
The puppy begins to stalk the cat,
sniffs at its footprints.

498
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,572
It attacks chickens- anything.

499
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:52,483
If you want to have a good dog,
take puppies from good dogs.

500
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,954
And of course,
it depends on how you bring it up.

501
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,117
If you take a good puppy
and put it inside

502
01:01:59,118 --> 01:02:02,189
and keep it there
for six months...

503
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:07,098
surely it won't make a good hunter
when you take it into the taiga.

504
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:22,206
An all-purpose dog is hard to come by.

505
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,808
If a dog likes to chase moose...

506
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:29,117
there's no way you can force it
to chase squirrels.

507
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,783
If the dog hears the squirrel,
it will bark a couple of times...

508
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,883
but won't go looking for it.

509
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:37,556
So if you are unhappy with such a dog,
get yourself another one.

510
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,496
If that one does not suit you,
get yet another one.

511
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,500
The more dogs you change...

512
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,403
the more chance you have
to get a dog that's just right for you.

513
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:24,828
Had about four.

514
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,925
Typically, good dogs don't live long.

515
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:33,671
Out of these four,
only one survived till he was 1

516
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:38,303
The rest died in their prime-
ages four to five.

517
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:45,615
My last dog was a bitch called Smoky.

518
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,689
It happened that a bear
came to the village.

519
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,954
When the bear roared,
all the village dogs vanished.

520
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:56,792
Released my male dog...

521
01:05:56,886 --> 01:06:01,198
but he just barked at the bear
a couple of times and fell silent.

522
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,567
Sensed that there was
something wrong.

523
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:15,339
When reached the place,
 heard my bitch, Smoky...

524
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:17,509
coughing and spitting
out the bear's hair.

525
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:22,885
She bit him several times,
and then she squealed and Went silent.

526
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,892
By that time, was already on the spot.

527
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:33,161
Saw the bear lying on the cow path
tearing at my clog.

528
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:41,106
Approached the bear
and took aim at his head.

529
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:47,644
But before pulled the trigger,
he heard me and raised his head...

530
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:51,879
and shot him in his front paw

531
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:55,217
The bullet made just a scratch.

532
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,621
He Went for me.

533
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:04,092
He was so close, nearly touched him
with the barrel of my rifle.

534
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:09,534
He approached me,
and shot him point-blank.

535
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,606
The bullet pushed him back. got him.

536
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,667
Smoky was still alive.

537
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:22,546
The male dog was torn to pieces.

538
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:27,280
Grabbed Smoky in my arms...

539
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:32,450
and then I saw that her belly had
been torn and her bowels were out.

540
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,960
Thought I could still save her...

541
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,362
and ran to the nurse Without
paying any attention to the bear.

542
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:44,734
Ran about 30, 40 meters
before saw that her head drooped.

543
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:47,398
She was gone.

544
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,976
Was oven/vheirned with sadness.

545
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,007
<i>Back In the village.</i>

546
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:03,379
<i>Like the trappers out In the taiga...</i>

547
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:07,887
<i>the villagers must also
be completely self-reliant.</i>

548
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,823
<i>Because no supplies can be
brought In during the winter..</i>

549
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:15,088
<i>they must make everything they need
by hand</i>

550
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,527
You see, we drop the net,
and the net goes down.

551
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,576
If you feel the rope doesn't play,
don't pull too hard.

552
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:17,815
That's it.

553
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:24,159
We wait for pike
or whatever fish we can catch.

554
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:32,837
<i>Temperatures have dropped by now
below minus 50 degrees...</i>

555
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,272
<i>and the days are growing short'.</i>

556
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:59,254
<i>The Yenisei River
is completely frozen oven ..</i>

557
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:02,962
<i>but still provides fish In abundance.</i>

558
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,134
We feed fish to the dogs...

559
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,907
and we eat it ourselves round the year.

560
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:17,416
Sometimes we fry it,
sometimes make fish soup.

561
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:20,851
There is nothing like fresh fish,
whatever kind.

562
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,657
Lenok. That's a great fish.

563
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,867
Pull some more.

564
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:39,497
We see something there.
A lot of good fish!

565
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,165
See how much fish!

566
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:46,339
Cover it up so it doesn't freeze.

567
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,105
<i>Out In the taiga...</i>

568
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:55,177
<i>Gennady negotiates his territory
along his frozen tributary</i>

569
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:59,316
<i>From here,
he will branch out to hum' sable.</i>

570
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:06,761
Everybody specializes in sable
because squirrels are cheap.

571
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,961
And as for ermine, you are lucky
if you can get one or two.

572
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:13,438
This one will be rejected
because it's too small.

573
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,668
They now accept only large ermine.

574
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:18,968
And the prices are ridiculous.

575
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:22,277
A good big ermine is about 125 rubles.

576
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,578
Of course the sable feeds us.

577
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:29,383
Prices seem to be going up,
and money is losing value.

578
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:33,449
Now have to pay 1,500 rubles
for What used to buy for 20 rubles.

579
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:38,498
<i>The traps are laid' out
along loops that take a day to travel.</i>

580
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:44,367
<i>This way;, he can safely reach
one of his outlying huts by nightfall</i>

581
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:22,533
This contraption- the lid,
the sticks and all-

582
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:26,943
and the footprints near
the trap attract him.

583
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,945
<i>This is how you set up the (koolyomka.</i>

584
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,099
<i>The triggering DE vice of his trap...</i>

585
01:13:53,195 --> 01:13:56,608
<i>is a primitive
yet sophisticated mechanism.</i>

586
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:14,887
This (koolyomka near the hut
traps some animals every year.

587
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,020
The difference between
a dead fall trap and a steel trap...

588
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,429
is that a sable that is hungry
will ignore the steel trap...

589
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:21,865
but the trick does not work
with the (koolyomka.

590
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:26,838
Whatever he does, once he pulls
at the bait, it comes down oh it.

591
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,336
The pelts have no bloodstains.

592
01:14:29,337 --> 01:14:31,742
The animal is as good
as if it were alive.

593
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:37,441
It's a humane method
because it kills at once.

594
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:48,217
Come to think of it,
we are all killers or accomplices.

595
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:56,963
Even those people who are kind-hearted
and tend to pity everything.

596
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:01,101
Why? it's very simple.

597
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:04,268
A farmer keeps a pig...

598
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,176
but he knows in advance
What he keeps it for.

599
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:11,479
In order to kill it
and to eat it or sell its meat.

600
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:14,952
And even the person who is sorry about
all this buys the pork from him.

601
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:21,721
And the trapper
is the same as that pig farmer...

602
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:27,324
only he is- how would you say it-
more honest.

603
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,826
Actually, it's not even about honesty.

604
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,338
This man knowingly raises-

605
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:39,937
I used to raise cattle, and I could
never bring myself to slaughter them.

606
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:44,848
Because there is, say, a bull.
You raise him for two years.

607
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:50,856
It comes to you expecting you to show
affection or give it some treat...

608
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:53,722
and instead he gets a
bullet in the head.

609
01:15:54,850 --> 01:16:02,996
In the taiga, the Wild animal knows that
no good can come from me, from a man.

610
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:07,300
He tries to escape.
Here, it's about who outsmarts whom.

611
01:16:56,445 --> 01:17:00,018
<i>Hundreds of kilometers away
is Anatoly's hut.</i>

612
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:04,594
<i>He Is In the middle
of his trapping season.</i>

613
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:07,860
<i>While we see
that he has no shortage of fish...</i>

614
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:12,371
<i>it is conspicuous how little
he gives his dog for breakfast.</i>

615
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:23,974
It all depends on how a man
treats his dog.

616
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:26,814
Some guys almost eat
from the same bowl with the dog...

617
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:29,388
and allow it to sleep
with him on the bunk.

618
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:33,522
But for one think it's wrong.

619
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:36,061
Don't allow my dog in
even when it's very cold outside.

620
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:37,789
He has his katukh, his shelter.

621
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:45,132
Think all he needs is to be fed.

622
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:49,437
He should eat his fill in the evening,
but not too much in the morning...

623
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:51,636
so his belly doesn't
drag on the ground.

624
01:17:53,902 --> 01:18:00,376
Trappers make a big mistake when they
beat their dogs for touching the traps.

625
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:06,452
Of course you have to punish them
and show your displeasure...

626
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,624
but beating alone
won't keep a dog off the traps.

627
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:15,634
It comes to be afraid of the owner.

628
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,432
It stays clear of the trap
in the presence of the owner...

629
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,703
but when the owner looks away, or at
night, he is sure to steal the bait.

630
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:27,146
And if it's afraid of the trap,
then it will stay away.

631
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,044
It's easy to train them.

632
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:37,279
You set up a trap specifically for dogs.

633
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:42,924
Let it spend some time in the trap...

634
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:46,522
and realize that it's not
a pleasant experience.

635
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:51,266
Otherwise, it will be endless trouble
for the hunter...

636
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:54,306
and he won't get along with his dog.

637
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,871
It will be afraid of
him and sneak out at

638
01:18:56,872 --> 01:18:59,345
night to make the
rounds of the traps...

639
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:02,176
and waste the hunter's efforts.

640
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:05,581
In short, you'll have no end of trouble
with your dog.

641
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:08,382
If you do it right, your dog loves you
and it's afraid of the traps.

642
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:10,184
What more do you need?

643
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:32,066
<i>The snowmobile is another one of the few
modern conveniences they employ;...</i>

644
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,471
<i>but, In this terrain, it has its limits.</i>

645
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:02,530
<i>Continuing his rounds on skis...</i>

646
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:07,573
<i>he resembles prehistoric man
from a distand' Ice age.</i>

647
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:26,743
<i>Day In, day out - it is the same routine
of hard work In severe conditions.</i>

648
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:30,953
<i>But out here,
the trapper is one of the fem.</i>

649
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:35,825
<i>to witness the beauty of space,
cold' and silence.</i>

650
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:40,350
<i>Imagine, after being exhausted
at the end of a hard day...</i>

651
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:42,587
<i>you are coming home to this.</i>

652
01:23:54,763 --> 01:24:00,543
<i>In the little remaining daylight, he
cannot possible return to his main hut</i>

653
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:04,344
<i>His only recourse is to fix this one.</i>

654
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:32,438
<i>Because Anatoly spent much of the next
day repairing his outlying nut ..</i>

655
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:37,772
<i>It takes him until nightfall
to find' his way back to his base hut.</i>

656
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:59,957
<i>It is the last day of December ..</i>

657
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:04,827
<i>and unusually mild'
at 33 degrees below zero.</i>

658
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,348
<i>Anatoly like all the other trappers...</i>

659
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:33,983
<i>will return to the village
for New Year's E I've.</i>

660
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:48,269
<i>The voyage is 750 kilometers
along the frozen river...</i>

661
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:53,369
<i>and we should note that Anatoly's dog
never rides on the snowmobile.</i>

662
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:58,383
<i>He covers the entire distance
running behind</i>

663
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:25,039
<i>At night', he is still running.</i>

664
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:46,098
<i>Finally, the village of Bakhtia
comes into view</i>

665
01:29:04,205 --> 01:29:05,843
<i>And here comes the dog.</i>

666
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:09,516
The dog must be hungry!

667
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:11,886
Of course he is.
He hasn't eaten for over a day.

668
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:36,040
Hey, come here.

669
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:43,922
<i>For Gennady and all of them,
this is a happy return.</i>

670
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:21,718
<i>Christmas Is celebrated In Russia
on January 6.</i>

671
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,791
<i>The entire village participates.</i>

672
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:59,731
<i>The stay for the trappers
will be a short' one.</i>

673
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:02,233
<i>After a few days and nights...</i>

674
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:07,796
<i>they will return to the taiga
for the remaining months of winter</i>

675
01:31:07,895 --> 01:31:10,569
<i>This is the life they love.</i>

676
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,808
Well, we're alone again.

677
01:31:49,305 --> 01:32:49,668

1
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,123
Alexander!

2
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,453
Alexander!

3
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,449
Get your head in the game for fuck's sake .

4
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,703
Move over.

5
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,791
Clearer evidence than this you can't get.

6
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,246
-It violates PSSA on several points.
-We'll check it out.

7
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:40,161
-How's the new job?
-If the defence doesn't handle this it'll go to hell.

8
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:45,657
-Make sure they take this seriously.
-Yes, we'll get in touch if we need help.

9
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,573
Greet the guys over at the power station.

10
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,412
The energy conflict around Östersjön is stepping up.

11
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,700
Russia is accused of still shipping oil ...

12
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:09,450
Klara and Alex! It is now on the radio
about these oil tankers. Klara?

13
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,990
Mom?

14
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:16,035
I think I know what I want as a Christmas present.

15
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,119
An instrument.

16
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:22,865
The evidence is considered too
insufficient to take any actions.

17
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:26,079
-Like a guitar then, or?
-Yes or...

18
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,832
Isn't that very expensive? Right?

19
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:31,077
Perhaps.

20
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,325
You.. you can always wish for it.

21
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,824
-What do you want?
-Alex wishes a guitar for Christmas gift.

22
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,788
-I just bought a new computer, isn't that good enough?
-Björn...

23
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,746
-Don't go around and promise him stuff.
-I have not promised anything.

24
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:53,159
Imagine if you could be a bit thankful for once.

25
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,450
You're just sitting and staring at the fucking TV.

26
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,662
-So you're the only one that's doing something? Huh?
-Shut up.

27
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,825
Björn! Don't go out again!

28
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:33,534
When are you going back to Stockholm?

29
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:37,747
She said like after Christmas.

30
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:43,331
But you never know with her, she works so much.

31
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:49,657
Dad was a musician, concert pianist.

32
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,698
Cool.

33
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:56,619
-He was very good.
-Is that why you also play the piano?

34
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:01,832
I do not play anymore, not after my dad died.

35
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,659
We could have a band.

36
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:15,864
What would our name be then?

37
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:22,782
Alex and Anna, or Annlex, maybe.

38
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:27,250
Or Alexanna.

39
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:33,123
What are we going to play? None of us can write songs.

40
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,454
No, it's hard..

41
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,948
-Bye.
-Bye.

42
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,408
I'll get it!

43
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,119
What are you doing?

44
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:43,491
-I have a Christmas present for you.
-What?! What is it?

45
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:47,159
-Just a thing.
-Come on now, tell me. What is it?

46
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,576
Maybe we can see each other tomorrow?
Before you go to Stockholm.

47
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,244
Gladly, but we're leaving just after breakfast, so come early.

48
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:57,953
Alex, the food is ready!

49
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,697
Right? You're just saying that.

50
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,866
-No I'm not.
-Yes, I think so.

51
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,957
-It looks nice.
-I hope so.

52
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,582
Are we supposed to eat all this?

53
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,040
-Thanks.
-Can I see?

54
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,997
"Sugababes", what the hell is this?

55
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:29,413
Last but not least. "Merry Christmas, Björn, from Klara."

56
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,824
-Varsågod.
-Is this for me?

57
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,536
Yes, to you.

58
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:39,035
Ha-ha! Check out who got the biggest package this year!

59
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,164
But what...

60
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:45,246
What the fuck?! Have you purchased a chainsaw?

61
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,700
This is ... This is good stuff, Klara.

62
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,413
-This isn't any trash, this is good.
-Is it?

63
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:58,872
Damn, Klara! I'm going out and ...
Wait here, I'll be coming soon.

64
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:03,081
-I have to get out and test.
-But you, Björn, Björn?

65
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,078
You...

66
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,161
Wait here.

67
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,491
Just open it.

68
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,532
-Thanks Mom!
-Varsågod.

69
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,953
What is this?

70
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,743
There was some money left that I've been saving here and there.

71
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:45,989
He really wanted one. What do you have there?

72
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,787
I said that we could not afford it

73
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,705
It is money that we haven't noticed anyway.

74
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:04,288
Have you pinched my money and bought Alex
some trash even though we could not afford it?

75
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,578
Svara for fuck's sake!

76
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,823
-Dad...
-Shut the fuck up!

77
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:14,909
-Björn!
-Wow, damn you.

78
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,914
I defended this country,

79
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:23,326
Now I work like some damn errand boy to provide for you two.

80
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:26,033
And what the hell is the thank you?

81
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,914
What the hell!

82
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:22,327
-You are so damn disrespectful!
-Your chainsaw was much more expensive!

83
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,458
-It's not about that for fuck's sake!
-What is it about then?

84
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,617
-He is a spoiled pussy!
-Stop it!

85
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:33,957
-He is a fucking bully victim!
-Why is he like that?

86
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:38,073
-Because you made him into that!
-No, because he's so damn like you!

87
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,369
-Is it really that urgent?
-Yes, they need me in the office as soon as possible.

88
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:05,491
Listen here Miss syrup, we are going now.
Help me with the bags.

89
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:10,582
-Can't you stay until lunch?
-Another time when it's a smaller job.

90
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,162
There's always a lot of work.

91
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,870
Can you take the bags, please?
Do I have to do everything for you? Anna!

92
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,371
Alex! Wait!

93
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,990
Hi.

94
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,783
Why are you so late? We are leaving now.

95
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:50,202
-Is anything wrong?
-No.

96
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,208
Has something happened?

97
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,286
Nothing.

98
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,617
Can't you just say...?
-It's nothing! Stop!

99
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,123
Eat.

100
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,540
Eat your food that I ...

101
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:59,000
You go up in your room. Go up, go up,

102
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,786
I hate you.

103
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,530
You, Alexander, can't we talk about this?

104
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,533
I thought...

105
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,825
What are you doing? Wait!
Where are you going?

106
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,072
Wait, Alexander! Where are you going?

107
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,787
Alexander, wait for fuck's sake.

108
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,328
Alex...

109
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,536
-Hi
-Hi

110
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:27,490
Is it sports holiday?
I have some friends over.

111
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,407
Has anything happened, or?

112
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:35,533
I'm renovating the apartment, so you can't stay for too long.

113
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,117
The set is not good enough, I don't
get any feeling from the piano.

114
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:20,329
Man! It is a damn Bechsteinflygel

115
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,118
Come on, we are kings! Check it out!

116
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,873
"We?"

117
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,996
We both have been fighting for this, you know it.

118
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:37,991
We go down to Berlin a few days in advance and party.

119
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:41,455
Berlin is crazy, the clubs are loco!

120
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:47,206
Come on, you need to have some fun. Let's go! Alex?

121
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,115
Alex...

122
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:53,955
-I need a new piano.
-Sit down, I'll fix a new piano.

123
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:59,119
-I do not need you.
-Come on, I'll fix a new piano.

124
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:00,498
Alex, what the fuck!

125
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:05,953
<i>The additional transmission continues with
regard to the situation in central Stockholm.</i>

126
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:10,289
<i>The police is blocking off the area around Slussen.</i>

127
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:16,078
<i>I can see at least 12, 13 police cars
and more are coming in now.</i>

128
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:22,746
<i>You can hear helicopters in the air so
the police is taking this seriously.</i>

129
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:27,707
<i>We do not know more than they! Apparently have
happened multiple explosions in Stockholm-</i>

130
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,911
<i>- including Slussen metro.</i>

131
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:36,407
<i>Pernilla Nilsson, you were there when the explosion hit.</i>

132
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,539
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

133
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:44,578
<i>I did not understand at first, I just
heard the bang. It can't be described.</i>

134
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,287
<i>There was some damn bang.</i>

135
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,073
<i>What the hell!</i>

136
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:59,408
Hello! You can't just stay there!

137
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:24,326
<i>Hello, you've reached Klara.
Unfortunately , I can't reply now.</i>

138
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,197
<i>Do not hesitate to call back later. Bye.</i>

139
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,749
<i>After the explosion at the Slussen metro...</i>

140
00:24:35,917 --> 00:24:39,489
<i>We can say that it's a carefully planned attack.</i>

141
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:43,239
<i>Despite pressure Sweden continues to deny foreign military-</i>

142
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:46,033
<i>-to protect it's own interests on Swedish soil.</i>

143
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:49,826
<i>On the midsummer day there is rainy
weather coming from the east.</i>

144
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,540
-Mother?
<i>-No, it's Erik. Your uncle.</i>

145
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,700
<i>The first bang blocked all traffic from Slussen.</i>

146
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:04,369
<i>Several victims should have tried to meet
their relatives before the second bang ...</i>

147
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:06,578
It was her train,

148
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,073
<i>Damn.</i>

149
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:16,539
I have to go back to work. I'll call
tonight, and we'll get everything up.

150
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,165
The funeral will take place in Vånga next week.

151
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:23,030
I can't then. I'm flying to Berlin on Friday.

152
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,994
You can't?

153
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,244
You can't?

154
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:32,160
For fuck's sale Alex, it's your mother we're talking about.

155
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,739
The flight is on Friday evening.

156
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:43,242
I'm free in the morning, so it'll have to be then.

157
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:48,491
-It's midsummer on Friday.
-You might have something more important planned?

158
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:54,072
Alex... Your dad doesn't know anything yet.
I can talk with him...

159
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,741
No, I'll do it.

160
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,996
-The Church of Sweden, this is Tomas.
-My name is Alex Stenberg.

161
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:52,204
You have an old piano that I would like to buy.

162
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:56,448
It may sound strange, but I played it when I was young.

163
00:26:56,625 --> 00:27:01,915
The safety of Sweden's infrastructure
has been neglected for several years.

164
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:55,123
Björn!

165
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:02,368
Björn, can you come and help me here?

166
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,870
What the hell, yes.

167
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:09,530
despite the troubles here in Stockholm.

168
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:14,281
Tomorrow it's midsummer. What plans do you have, Anders?

169
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,331
Mornin', mornin'.

170
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,875
No, we should have some introduction test-

171
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,328
-so we don't let any damn idiots into.

172
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,832
Then you would get kicked out fast, Lasse.

173
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,700
You, it's computers and immigrants
that make this country go to hell.

174
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:56,916
-What are you doing?
-The door sensor at the shed is loose.

175
00:29:57,083 --> 00:30:00,405
-What are you going to do?
-I want to keep an eye on you.

176
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,325
I want to know which door you use when you slink off from work.

177
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,743
Looks like somebody is afraid that the IS
and al-Qaida are going to thunder in-

178
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:12,957
and demand jihad on the Swedish electrical grid.
Take it easy, Björn.

179
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:16,743
Some idiot blows up a bit in Stockholm to get attention.

180
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,784
First of all, no one has taken on the deed-

181
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:24,076
-and, secondly, SÄPO has not caught any suspects.

182
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,831
Okay ... Continue.

183
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,037
Any idiot can build a bomb.

184
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:33,121
Combine some diesel oil and fertilizer then you have a bomb.

185
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:39,244
Are you destroying two of Stockholm's most
important nodes within ten minutes-

186
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:43,706
-and get away with that...
Then you have something to say.

187
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,615
Say what?

188
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:49,250
Last week Sweden closed down Nordstream.

189
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:52,580
It is Russia's largest and most important ...

190
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,493
Now conspiracy-Björn is back at it again! Damn that's nice!

191
00:30:56,667 --> 00:31:00,615
-Are you saying the the Russian is behind this?
-There are hidden agendas.

192
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,329
You have to stop browsing around Flashback.

193
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,082
There is a swing door in Sweden!

194
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,289
Any fucking idiot can drop in here. Even criminals.

195
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:13,575
It's just like Alibaba and his gang outside of ICA.

196
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,994
Happy midsummer, then.

197
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,874
Yes Yes. Happy midsummer to you,

198
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:44,990
Hey hey! Happy midsummer!

199
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,574
Hello!

200
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,787
It's a protected area here.

201
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,162
You are not allowed to be here.

202
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:32,329
You can't be here!

203
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,663
You go! Go away from here!

204
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,495
-Okay, Ich will gehen.
-Yes.

205
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:37,697
May I see your ID? passport

206
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,911
- Reilsepass?
-Yes.

207
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,949
Welcome to the police.

208
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:36,915
In case of emergency or when in progress
crimes and other emergency events-

209
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:40,530
-call 112 instead.

210
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,619
Yes, yes, yes!

211
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,499
Hey, Lasse here, leave a flirt on the machine-

212
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,999
-I will call back if I fall in love. Until later!

213
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:52,911
- What about this matter?
-Trespassing, sabotage

214
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:57,531
-or espionage. Trespassing!
-Sorry, I did not understand.

215
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:01,451
- Describe your matter again.
-Yes, yes.

216
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:05,789
Trespassing.

217
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:08,290
Hey! Hello?

218
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,574
Wait, Konny. They're here,

219
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,914
There was a fucking Russian who spoke German over at the fence.

220
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:19,156
-He picked berries and ...
-Picked berries?

221
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:24,282
-No, he ... Hell! Are you still there?
-Did he steal your lingonberry, or?

222
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,416
No no. What a little, Konny,

223
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:31,952
Please describe your case again.
You can, for example, say theft report...

224
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:35,572
For fuck's sake! I have been knocked out by a damn Russian

225
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:39,447
Do you understand that, your damn police?

226
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:43,120
You, where is Lasse? He's not answering.

227
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:46,864
-He fucking his ex-wife in Umeå.
-What?

228
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:51,411
-He wasn't supposed to go there until tomorrow.
-Guess he couldn't keep it in his pants.

229
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:55,201
Konny ... Imagine if Russia is behind
everything that has happened.

230
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,912
Think if they want Sweden to look weak-

231
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:01,575
-to take back control of energy exports

232
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:07,165
-Ask if they want to shut down the entire electrical grid.
-Calm down, you're drunk.

233
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:13,249
This is what makes Stockholm want to replace us with computers.

234
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:16,534
-IS has already claimed the attacks.
-IS?

235
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,541
Turn on the TV, they are on every fucking channel.

236
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:24,407
Calm down with the schnapps, we'll get in touch tomorrow.

237
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,494
Bye.

238
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:39,619
<i>According to the security police it's clear that
the terrorist organization IS -</i>

239
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:42,124
<i>-is behind the terrorist attacks in Stockholm.</i>

240
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:50,072
<i>And instead stay at home celebrating with loved ones.</i>

241
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,949
<i>After the events of the last few days,
extra police will patrol-</i>

242
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:59,539
<i>-but the police emphasize that the risk
of more attacks is very low.</i>

243
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:01,244
<i>Now over the sport...</i>

244
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,741
Lasse!

245
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,243
Lasse?

246
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:32,246
Sorry. Have you seen ... Wait, I'm coming over.

247
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,830
Have you seen any shady people here?

248
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,288
Anyone claiming to be pick berries?

249
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,414
-No.
-No?

250
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:45,326
-There aren't any berries this time of year. Are you mad?
-Excuse me...

251
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,948
Come on, drive.

252
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:16,198
It's as if we thought time would never get out of our hands ...

253
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,331
Where is Björn?

254
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,286
He did not want to come.

255
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:24,790
The moments passes us by.

256
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,791
Have you seen any German berry picker?
-No.

257
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:31,246
-A tall man with tassel?
-No, nobody.

258
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,454
-The Church of Sweden, this is Tomas.
-Hi, it's about the piano.

259
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:46,164
Yeah right. I asked our choirleader to stay and help you.

260
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:51,911
The only thing I can think of is that
my brother had his bike stolen.

261
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:55,951
-He lives over there.
-Thank you, thank you.

262
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:11,827
Excuse me.

263
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,742
Excuse me. Move.

264
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,954
Move. Move!

265
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:01,370
<i>According to Telia can up to 70% of all subscribers-</i>

266
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:04,409
<i>- have a problem during midsummer weekend.</i>

267
00:40:04,583 --> 00:40:06,790
<i>We have a big overload on the net-</i>

268
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:10,155
<i>-which makes it that the net can come and go
under the midsummer weekend.</i>

269
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:14,372
<i>We are a bit understaffed because of it
being midsummer, but we're going to fix this.</i>

270
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:18,831
<i>We are counting on having this problem fixed
by the beginning of the next week.</i>

271
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,366
You are doing good now.
Are you not happy?

272
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:10,328
Yes.

273
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,618
What kind of piano does maestro play now days?

274
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:18,159
-An Bechsteinflygel
-Fine, as it should be.

275
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:24,160
But.. I don't get any feel of it.

276
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:30,788
Not like the piano you
played on in the church.

277
00:42:32,292 --> 00:42:38,822
I've thought about it sometimes, how we
used to go there and play together.

278
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:45,367
There was a tone, a feeling I miss.

279
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:50,245
Do you understand what I mean?

280
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,457
Alex, I...

281
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:01,625
God, you probably have
a lot of things to do.

282
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,953
It's midsummer and everything,

283
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:10,244
No.

284
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:30,325
Don't you want to dip your feet?
It's pretty nice.

285
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,333
I get easily cold and play
the piano with my feet.

286
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,616
-With your feet?
-Yes.

287
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:38,078
The pedals, you know.

288
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,081
Here we go!

289
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,447
There you can go out. It will be okay.

290
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:20,364
I want to feel more joy, like.

291
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:22,703
Have you feel so for long?

292
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,207
I had fun tonight.

293
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:51,367
You did not have to stay.

294
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:56,783
I wanted to.

295
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:13,623
Do you like this in Vånga?

296
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:20,913
Because mom got a job in the parliament after you left-

297
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:26,828
-and did not have as much time for me,
so I had to move back to grandmother.

298
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,867
Then I stayed.

299
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,491
I'll...

300
00:45:58,042 --> 00:46:01,660
Has Britta left the hostel over at Rungården?

301
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:06,532
No. Her son Fredrik, if you remember him ...

302
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:08,994
He has taken over.
-But it remains?

303
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,704
Yes, it remains

304
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:20,957
Yeah... Bye, then.

305
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:29,206
You could sleep with us, if you want?

306
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:32,623
Gladly.

307
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,119
Okay.

308
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,331
<i>18-13, Over.</i>

309
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,162
<i>Ivar Bertil waiting for Adam Caesar...</i>

310
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:36,866
Björn Stenberg, trafo Vånga.
Send reinforcement as soon as possible.

311
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:41,536
Russian special soldiers dressed as
German tourists are taking...

312
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:49,284
Björn Stenberg, Transformer Vånga. I want help now.

313
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:54,452
I have scarcely secured the building, but I need help ...

314
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:09,364
Björn Stenberg here. I'm sitting here
playing red white rose by myself.

315
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:12,614
Can you send any more
people who want to play?

316
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:40,239
Hey you. It's dad.

317
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:48,738
You, I want you to take yourself to safety as soon as you can.

318
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:50,782
There is something ...

319
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:55,284
There's some shit that's about to happen here.

320
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:01,288
I do not want you to be outside and..

321
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:07,998
I...

322
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:37,450
Hello, open the door, it's the police!

323
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:39,081
Hello?

324
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,327
Hello?

325
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:49,125
Come on now, open the door!

326
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:52,123
Countryside Minister?

327
00:50:52,292 --> 00:50:54,578
-Yes.
-You must come with us now.

328
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:13,290
<i>-Anders, have you heard anything from Karin?
-No.</i>

329
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:25,745
<i>Sweden has today raised its preparedness to the highest-</i>

330
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,624
<i>-with immediate risk of war.</i>

331
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:33,616
<i>New information has the prime minister
to mobilize the total defense-</i>

332
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:37,580
<i>-and in consultation with the Foreign Affairs
Council decided that the war delegation-</i>

333
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:41,698
<i>-will replace the Riksdag and that
the government is brought in security.</i>

334
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:47,666
-Where is the prime minister?
<i>-With the Defense Minister in Parliament House.</i>

335
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:51,872
Does this have to do with the terrorist attack?
<i>-We cannot go into details.</i>

336
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,079
<i>We can rule out that IS is behind this week's attempt.</i>

337
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,457
<i>This is much more...</i>

338
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,870
<i>In order to ensure the government's ability to act</i>

339
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:05,489
<i>You are now grouped over three separate management centers.</i>

340
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:09,910
<i>There you can act safely in consultation with
each other and the prime minister.</i>

341
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:15,203
<i>It is important that you do not try to
contact someone at this time.</i>

342
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,867
We will take you to the cars now, we have a sharp position.

343
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:22,078
I just have to get my bag.

344
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,411
Hello?

345
00:52:57,583 --> 00:53:00,165
Hello? Mother?

346
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:04,281
Hello do you hear me?
Stay where you are, I'm coming to you.

347
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,036
What the hell.

348
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:39,079
Come on now.

349
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:44,783
Come on!

350
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,700
What is this?

351
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,828
It's my family.

352
00:54:00,042 --> 00:54:02,784
Elin is 5 years old.

353
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:07,076
I got her when I was 21, after a year along with Kim.

354
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:17,035
Yes, she slept somewhere else
tonight and he worked late.

355
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:20,784
Elin slept with a friend.

356
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:24,409
They would have been here now, but I can't...

357
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:27,579
There is something wrong with the phones.

358
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:38,536
I would go and get grandmother. Can I go with you, or?

359
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:48,034
Wait, sorry!

360
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:54,905
Sorry, I should have said something.

361
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,284
Can we try to talk about this?

362
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,789
What?

363
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:11,907
Then leave!

364
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:47,078
Hello!

365
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:50,789
Hello?

366
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:01,414
Help me.

367
00:58:01,542 --> 00:58:03,658
Where am I?

368
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:06,203
Stop!

369
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:11,955
<i>We'll continue the extra broadcast of the night's events.</i>

370
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:16,786
<i>SÄPO has revealed limited information about what has happened-</i>

371
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:22,078
<i>-but that there are unrest in several places
around the country is clear</i>

372
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,040
<i>We do not get the treatment we have the right too.</i>

373
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:29,409
<i>My son is sick,
I can't talk to him-</i>

374
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:32,284
<i>-and now I can't get into the hospital</i>

375
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,780
<i>Is there any kind of quarantine? Why can't people get in?</i>

376
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:39,405
<i>It is not just around the hospital there is military activity</i>

377
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:43,455
<i>At the old air base F13 in Norrköping, hundreds of soldie...</i>

378
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:27,450
Hey there? Why are you driving your own car?

379
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:32,912
They did not have enough cars back there
so they asked me to take my own.

380
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:36,780
-What was the name?
-Eva.

381
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:41,657
We have a woman here who drives south along Vasabron.

382
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:44,534
-Should she take her own car?
-We do not have time with this.

383
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:47,165
<i>No one drives in their own car. Ask her to turn around.</i>

384
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:49,574
Roger. Out.

385
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:55,458
Eve, I'll ask you to turn around and join the others. Okay?

386
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:58,830
Hey! Hello! Hello, stay!

387
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,164
Stop god damn it!

388
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,453
Damn...

389
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,532
Hello?

390
01:03:18,292 --> 01:03:20,203
Hey there.

391
01:03:20,417 --> 01:03:22,533
Is Anna here?

392
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:26,955
-The mobile phones have no coverage.
-I'm taking a look at Göran's phone.

393
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:29,328
Alex...

394
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:32,534
I was going to pick you and grandma up.

395
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:35,158
Åke will pick us up in a little while.

396
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:39,909
You sit down and take a break meanwhile.

397
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:45,410
The phones work again.

398
01:03:47,167 --> 01:03:48,657
Hello?

399
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:23,156
-But won't we wait for Åke?
-Alex, what's happening?

400
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:27,281
Åke thinks I'm in church. He gets terrified.

401
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:29,289
-Is your mobile phone working?
-No.

402
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:33,956
-What is happening?
-I do not know. There's something going on.

403
01:05:34,167 --> 01:05:39,412
People behave strangely and the military
gather at some air base in Norrköping.

404
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,915
-F13?
-What?

405
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:46,911
Kim is a soldier. They called everyone yesterday,
but said it was an exercise.

406
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:51,536
-Oh my god, Elin. I have to go get Elin.
-We must seek protection now.

407
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:54,290
-No, I have to get my daughter.
-And Åke.

408
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:57,284
-Yes, grandma!
-Stop the car, we have to get Åke.

409
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:59,164
Alex...

410
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:02,409
Hello? Where are we going?

411
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,283
Where are you?

412
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,908
It was you, you damn pig.

413
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:33,534
Where do you have your damn Reisepass?

414
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:39,540
<i>All Ceasar. All Ceasar.</i>

415
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:52,082
<i>All Ceasar from Adam.
Write Gustav answers. Over.</i>

416
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:53,532
<i>Over.</i>

417
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:59,202
<i>Orientation. Sweden is under attack. Over.</i>

418
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:03,535
<i>Erik Ceasar is flying to the transformer
station in Kramfors. Over.</i>

419
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,290
Damn that I'm always right

420
01:15:07,542 --> 01:15:11,785
Gustav Ceasar reclassifies with own vehicles to Grävlingen-

421
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:15,030
-and meets up with the government. Over.

422
01:15:15,167 --> 01:15:19,456
Filip Ceasar flies to Vånga transformer station with me.

423
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:22,784
Everyone report at arrival. Final. Out.

424
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:25,540
<i>From Gustav Ceasar. Roger. Out.</i>

425
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:51,415
Adam Ceasar to all Ceasar

426
01:15:52,292 --> 01:15:55,910
Gustav Ceasar, regroup to Grävlingen.

427
01:15:59,167 --> 01:16:03,581
Or wait ... you are flying with me to Vånga.

428
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:06,157
Over.

429
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:13,662
<i>Adam Erik to Erik Bertil. You have
already given that order. Over.</i>

430
01:16:30,417 --> 01:16:33,159
Hello? Hello?

431
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:38,075
What is happening? Why do we stop here?

432
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:42,535
-We have to seek protection.
-I have to get Elin!

433
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:44,703
This was not a good idea.

434
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:48,204
Move! You are not allowed here!

435
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:52,905
Hello! You have to move over there!

436
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:56,910
What are you doing?
Shouldn’t we go down the mountain room?

437
01:16:57,042 --> 01:17:03,413
Who is this? I just told you. Eriksson and Lenny.

438
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:06,575
-I told my brother too.
-And I told Cissi.

439
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:08,908
I didn't think she should be alone.

440
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:12,579
You cannot just storm back and begin to decide.

441
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:16,785
-I have a family to take care of.
-The family not worth mentioning?

442
01:17:16,958 --> 01:17:21,907
We must try to cooperate. We are equally afraid all of us.

443
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:26,031
-No, I'm most afraid of us all.
-Get in the car!

444
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:30,201
-You only talked about your perfect life.
-I have done what we dreamed about.

445
01:17:30,417 --> 01:17:34,581
I do not care what you've done! You mean nothing to me.

446
01:17:34,792 --> 01:17:38,455
That's not true. You were completely
ruined when Alex disappeared.

447
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:42,159
-Grandma!
-Didn't you think I would understand?

448
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:47,207
That's why you moved home to me incase Alex would come back.

449
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:51,160
This is a secure location, you must not be here!

450
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:56,033
What the hell?

451
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:11,413
She reads the newspaper only when it's
about you and she has all your records.

452
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:16,407
I've never had a good time with the music. There is no song.

453
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:21,533
What the hell?

454
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:32,532
Move!

455
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:59,448
Get out of the car

456
01:19:08,292 --> 01:19:09,828
Damn!

457
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:13,158
-Come on, we must go!
-We can't go without grandma!

458
01:19:13,292 --> 01:19:15,078
Come on! Run!

459
01:19:38,917 --> 01:19:41,659
Alex...

460
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:56,533
Thanks!

461
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:02,830
-We must go now, do you not understand?
-Grandma, for fuck's sake!

462
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:24,666
Julia?
Have you seen Monica?

463
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:28,324
What is happening?

464
01:20:29,042 --> 01:20:31,909
Alex? Hello do you hear me?

465
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,323
Julia!

466
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:36,407
Julia!

467
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:37,782
Julia!

468
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:45,332
Where the hell are the keys? Julia!

469
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:48,784
Help me, for fuck's sake! My wife is out there!

470
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:51,165
-No no.
-Julia!

471
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:55,782
Stop!

472
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:58,329
Stop, Konny!

473
01:20:58,542 --> 01:21:02,160
-It's something dangerous out there!
-Julia!

474
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:05,079
My wife is out there for fuck's sake!

475
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:22,164
Nobody opens the door.

476
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:28,532
-Now you open the damn door, Björn.
-Stop, Konny!

477
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:32,574
-Keys!
-We do not know what's happening to them.

478
01:21:32,792 --> 01:21:35,784
-Julia is out there, for fuck's sake!
-Calm down, Konny!

479
01:21:35,917 --> 01:21:37,782
Shut up!

480
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:42,907
Your conspiracy jail idiot!
You always know what's going on!

481
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:49,328
Konny... They have knocked out
every transformer station in the country.

482
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:53,080
The whole electrical backbone flows through us now.

483
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:56,324
Konny...

484
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:58,698
They will be back.

485
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:09,281
I know you all seek help, but this is a protected area-

486
01:22:09,417 --> 01:22:12,534
-and as soon as we know what's happening out there, you've got to be out of here.

487
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:14,908
No, that are the rules.

488
01:22:15,042 --> 01:22:18,159
Wait. Your son is here. He is hurt.

489
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:33,448
Watch your head.

490
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:35,908
-Put him on this.
-Is he going to make it?

491
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:41,032
I'll take him. There are blankets here and restrooms at the end of the corridor.

492
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:59,040
You look a little cold.

493
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:02,531
Thanks.

494
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:05,659
Honey... It's gonna be alright.

495
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:07,539
Give me!

496
01:23:37,042 --> 01:23:41,206
He survives. He survives.

497
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:44,534
I stopped them now, but there are more of them next time.

498
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:48,280
The helicopters here to protect the plant.

499
01:23:48,417 --> 01:23:51,705
It does not seem to be so much of it.

500
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:57,412
So you and Alex, you are...
He has been so damn bad at getting in touch.

501
01:23:57,583 --> 01:24:01,201
-But we're not...
-Communication lies down.

502
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:04,784
Before we know what has hit them out there, you'll stay in .

503
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:09,952
The military should understand that something has gone wrong and send more reinforcement.

504
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:14,581
Well, if there is any military left to send, of course.

505
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:21,204
-Where are you going?
-I have to get my daughter.

506
01:24:21,792 --> 01:24:23,532
Wait!

507
01:24:25,917 --> 01:24:27,453
Daughter?

508
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:31,825
Wait, please ...

509
01:24:36,583 --> 01:24:39,541
You do not have to get
into this crap again.

510
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:43,200
-You must stay with Alex.
-No, I'll do this.

511
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:45,533
Stay here with Alex.

512
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:47,953
Björn... Stay here.

513
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:55,914
What the hell?

514
01:24:56,042 --> 01:24:58,784
Hey you! Cut this off! Hell!

515
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:00,789
Hey, wait up!

516
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:09,827
Line forward!

517
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:27,034
Take off your clothes and put them in the bucket over there.

518
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:04,414
Can you take a sip?

519
01:27:09,542 --> 01:27:11,533
How many counties do Sweden have?

520
01:27:13,833 --> 01:27:17,030
-25.
-What is a horse?

521
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:18,202
What?

522
01:27:19,042 --> 01:27:23,411
-This is just a question, answer normally.
-Who is Zlatan?

523
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:28,332
But what's happening?
-Pettersson, cut it. She remembers.

524
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:31,033
We have to check this.

525
01:27:31,167 --> 01:27:34,785
We lost three colleagues before we realized
that the infection is in the rain.

526
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:36,789
What's in the rain?

527
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:41,907
We suspect some form of alpha-CaM or
beta-amyloid, but do not know for sure.

528
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:46,156
You know when people lose memory when
they've suffered something traumatic.

529
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:50,786
The body releases a protein that
strikes out the affected neurons.

530
01:27:50,917 --> 01:27:55,331
The Israeli army wanted to use in it battle
for reducing the number of deaths-

531
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:58,033
-while still lowering the morale of the enemy side.

532
01:27:58,167 --> 01:28:01,955
It's simply like getting Alzheimer's
but it takes 15 minutes.

533
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:04,203
Are the others on their way?

534
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:07,952
Who?

535
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:12,159
The rest of the government.

536
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:14,449
Has no more come?

537
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:19,453
No.

538
01:28:19,667 --> 01:28:21,203
But you have called for help?

539
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:25,535
Unless the government meets, the prime
minister will make such a decision.

540
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:27,828
The prime minister is dead.

541
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:41,659
It was an attack on Parliament House and
he was just about to go.

542
01:28:44,958 --> 01:28:48,155
Listen up everyone. We have food
and diesel for a month down here.

543
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:50,328
If only we, it may be longer.

544
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:56,458
Those out there knows nothing about the infection.
-That is unfortunately not our responsibility.

545
01:28:56,667 --> 01:28:59,033
Landers, you are letting Krantz know.

546
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:01,824
We close and lock the gates from now on.

547
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:04,539
Landers!

548
01:29:06,792 --> 01:29:09,078
Yes, come on now.

549
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:11,783
Is this communication center?

550
01:29:13,292 --> 01:29:15,533
Hello? Hello!

551
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:18,783
What are you doing? Did not you listen at all?

552
01:29:18,917 --> 01:29:23,160
Even though the electricity is gone, the transmission
relays in the country should work

553
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:25,915
and then we can warn several thousand households.

554
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:30,035
They have managed to locate and knock out
every broadcasting stat-

555
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:32,039
and the same thing is happening to us.

556
01:29:32,208 --> 01:29:36,952
-People dies!
-It is not we who make such decisions.

557
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:39,032
She is right.

558
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:42,328
Emil ... My family is out there.

559
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:46,658
Tholén, lock the communications center.

560
01:29:47,792 --> 01:29:48,451
Tholén!

561
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:53,829
Who helps her with the radio?
-Listen...

562
01:29:54,042 --> 01:29:56,203
Someone help her with the radio!

563
01:30:00,542 --> 01:30:04,080
Tholén, think very carefully for now.

564
01:30:04,292 --> 01:30:06,032
Follow me.

565
01:30:15,167 --> 01:30:18,034
Landers, act! Wake up, damn!

566
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:19,948
-Råsmark!
-Stay still.

567
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:22,158
Lay on your stomach.

568
01:30:23,542 --> 01:30:25,032
Calm yourself!

569
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:28,830
-Help!
-Call someone! Get the phone!

570
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:31,203
Lay still!

571
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:32,827
Wounded!

572
01:30:33,042 --> 01:30:35,283
-Follow me. Hurry up.
-Lay still!

573
01:30:42,417 --> 01:30:46,831
I contact the embassies via satellite
while you talk over the radio.

574
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:51,285
When we're in transit, we're visible, so make it quick.

575
01:30:54,042 --> 01:30:56,328
Are you ready?

576
01:30:56,542 --> 01:30:59,659
-No.
-Let's go.

577
01:31:19,667 --> 01:31:21,157
Hi.

578
01:31:32,958 --> 01:31:37,406
You, careful. Lie down again.
You have a good jack in your head.

579
01:31:37,542 --> 01:31:39,157
Where is Anna?

580
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:43,574
Forget about her.

581
01:31:43,792 --> 01:31:46,579
It's no idea she's gone.

582
01:31:47,792 --> 01:31:49,202
What?

583
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:52,159
She tied me down.

584
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:55,291
Did you let her go out?

585
01:31:55,417 --> 01:31:59,786
No. I tried to go myself, but she tied me down.

586
01:31:59,958 --> 01:32:02,916
Alexander, go back.

587
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:05,790
Forget about that, it's too late, she's already on her way.

588
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:10,531
-I opened up here for your sake.
-You've never done anything for me!

589
01:32:10,667 --> 01:32:12,783
Why do you say that?

590
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:17,030
I've done everything for your sake. For you and mommy.

591
01:32:17,208 --> 01:32:22,783
Everything that happened is your fault, don't you understand?

592
01:32:22,917 --> 01:32:26,830
How can it be my fault? It where you who left.

593
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:30,284
It was you who left me.

594
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:34,155
Who the hell do you think you took care of all? That was me.

595
01:32:34,292 --> 01:32:36,658
You do not even call.

596
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:41,782
Calling? What  would I call and tell you?

597
01:32:41,917 --> 01:32:46,411
You do not call me. You never have...

598
01:32:48,417 --> 01:32:51,284
You've never said sorry to me.

599
01:32:52,542 --> 01:32:55,659
What am I going to say sorry for, Alexander?

600
01:32:57,542 --> 01:33:00,579
Because I took care of you? Huh?

601
01:33:00,792 --> 01:33:05,035
Because I took care of you and your mother?
Should I say sorry for that?

602
01:33:06,917 --> 01:33:12,037
When do you realize how good we had it? Huh?

603
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:16,160
Then you can come back and everything can be as usual again.

604
01:33:20,667 --> 01:33:23,033
Klara is dead.

605
01:33:47,792 --> 01:33:50,204
I hear something on the radio! Come on!

606
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:53,454
...the ruthless attack that occurs in Sweden.

607
01:33:53,667 --> 01:33:57,410
We do not know who or what lies behind the attack.

608
01:33:57,583 --> 01:34:04,534
All of you who are in the country, keep away from the rain.

609
01:34:09,917 --> 01:34:11,703
Anna!

610
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:16,953
Anna

611
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:22,082
The rain contains some form of chemical warfare-

612
01:34:22,292 --> 01:34:27,662
-which affect the brain and black out our memories.

613
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:32,081
If you or someone you know been affected, then...

614
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:39,664
we do not know if there is any cure yet, but keep it together.

615
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:50,156
We'll do that hair.

616
01:34:52,542 --> 01:34:56,911
Take care of the time you have together.

617
01:34:57,042 --> 01:34:59,283
before it is too late

618
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:10,289
Sorry.

619
01:35:22,667 --> 01:35:25,955
-Dad!
-Elin, stop! Stop!

620
01:35:30,042 --> 01:35:33,159
Get in the car. Okay?

621
01:35:41,042 --> 01:35:44,910
We were at F13. There is nobody left.

622
01:35:46,417 --> 01:35:51,662
People came in helicopters and shot at
anyone who was not infected.

623
01:35:58,917 --> 01:36:01,533
Kim is dead, Alex.

624
01:36:01,708 --> 01:36:03,790
Everyone is dead.

625
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:41,783
Grandmother is still down there.

626
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:49,539
Over.

627
01:36:50,208 --> 01:36:51,789
Wait!

628
01:36:53,917 --> 01:36:56,408
Come, honey! Come!

629
01:37:07,208 --> 01:37:09,415
Elin, come on!

630
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:16,825
Hello? They are coming, they are here.

631
01:37:17,042 --> 01:37:20,159
Is anyone hearing me?
Two helicopters are here.

632
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:23,040
Everyone must be out now. Is there anyone who listens?

633
01:37:23,792 --> 01:37:24,907
Hello!

634
01:37:25,708 --> 01:37:29,155
Does anyone hear me? Hello?

635
01:37:38,708 --> 01:37:40,414
We have to get out of here now.

636
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:48,415
Grandmother! Grandmother!

637
01:37:49,167 --> 01:37:53,160
Help! Help! But fuck's sake!

638
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:02,408
Come darling.

639
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:04,699
-Hurry!
-Wait!

640
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:08,540
Dad are still there, I have to...

641
01:38:08,708 --> 01:38:11,950
You have to run in advance, I have to pick him up. Hurry!

642
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:26,662
-Has something happened?
-What the fuck are you doing?

643
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:32,578
You have not called, you have not visited,
but now you suddenly care.

644
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:35,742
Kim ... What are you doing here?

645
01:38:35,917 --> 01:38:40,866
They said it was an exercise on F13,
then they drove me here.

646
01:38:41,042 --> 01:38:44,580
Do you mean I'm bad, not being with them?

647
01:38:46,042 --> 01:38:50,661
When was the last time you met Anna or Elin?

648
01:38:50,833 --> 01:38:53,666
Elin does not even remember who you are.

649
01:38:56,792 --> 01:39:01,616
When this is over, I never want to see you again.

650
01:39:02,958 --> 01:39:05,244
Someone is entering.

651
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,866
-How many are they?
-Two helicopters.

652
01:39:19,042 --> 01:39:21,158
-Did your girl get help?
-No.

653
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:25,788
-So what's the plan?
-There is no plan.

654
01:39:27,208 --> 01:39:28,948
What are you doing? Come on!

655
01:39:29,958 --> 01:39:33,325
Here. Bring everyone to the church!

656
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:37,197
If I get help, I will send them there. Get out of here!

657
01:39:41,292 --> 01:39:43,533
Where the hell is the receiver?

658
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,581
Give it to me.

659
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:51,207
-Couple color against color.
-What?

660
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:54,333
Red against red and yellow against yellow.

661
01:39:55,125 --> 01:39:57,958
A helicopter just landed, somebody
has located our transmission.

662
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:00,787
-Friend or foe?
-Unclear. Erik Bertil is investigating.

663
01:40:00,958 --> 01:40:03,165
Prepare to evacuate.

664
01:40:16,917 --> 01:40:21,661
I see two helicopters. no markings. We move closer. Over.

665
01:40:21,833 --> 01:40:25,030
Trafo Vånga calling on open channel. Should I answer the call?

666
01:40:27,458 --> 01:40:31,622
-Yes, get them on call group three.
-Roger.

667
01:40:33,542 --> 01:40:35,908
Are you still here? Hello?

668
01:40:36,667 --> 01:40:38,328
Bertil Gustav here. Over.

669
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,832
Björn Stenberg, Transformer Vånga.

670
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,413
The plant is under attack,
we request immediate help.

671
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:48,997
Two hostile helicopters at the entrance
and lots of civilians. Over.

672
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,581
Evacuate!

673
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:56,618
Landers...
Transport the injured by road Bertil.

674
01:40:56,792 --> 01:41:03,288
-Speaking to the highest command. Over.
-They are dead, only civilian here. Over.

675
01:41:04,875 --> 01:41:07,992
Can you escape without coming into contact with the rain? Over.

676
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:11,330
- It has stopped raining.
-Yes, it has stopped raining. Over.

677
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,866
We can get to the church. Over.

678
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:17,409
<i>Good, take everyone to church.
I'll be there in 60 minutes.</i>

679
01:41:17,583 --> 01:41:21,701
<i>Just stay away from the rain.
We are on our way. Over.</i>

680
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:25,915
<i>-Are you still there? Over.</i>
-We're still here. Over.

681
01:41:26,542 --> 01:41:29,579
Is there an Anna there?
<i>She has a daughter.</i>

682
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:33,197
<i>It's my family. Are they okay?
Over.</i>

683
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:35,741
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Yes, they are here.

684
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:41,284
What are you doing? Who was he?

685
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:44,370
Are you still there? Over. Hello?

686
01:41:48,583 --> 01:41:50,790
We take care of this later. Come here now.

687
01:41:52,542 --> 01:41:54,407
Alexander, come on!

688
01:41:54,583 --> 01:41:57,905
The military are coming to the church,
we must get all there.

689
01:41:58,083 --> 01:42:01,905
-What are you doing? Come now!
-I can't.

690
01:42:05,958 --> 01:42:08,415
What the hell. Come here now.

691
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:10,494
Come here. Come on.

692
01:42:13,083 --> 01:42:17,076
Now you're coming, for fuck's sake!
You are going with me to the church.

693
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:19,582
<i>-Go up to your room!
-Why?</i>

694
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:21,581
Because I say so!

695
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:24,822
Where are you going? Alexander, wait!

696
01:42:25,917 --> 01:42:27,908
Alexander, wait for fuck's sake

697
01:42:28,833 --> 01:42:29,868
Alexander!

698
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:32,990
Calm down!

699
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:23,581
Tholén...

700
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:30,449
Take the minister to the reassembly point.
I take one of the vehicles to Vånga.

701
01:44:31,542 --> 01:44:35,114
Tholén, for fuck's sake. My family.

702
01:44:36,375 --> 01:44:40,789
Try to get in touch with Home Guard, they should be ready now.

703
01:44:40,958 --> 01:44:42,198
Good luck.

704
01:44:42,375 --> 01:44:44,661
-I'm coming with.
-You must be protected.

705
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:47,745
I don't care my safety.
I have to meet my daughter.

706
01:45:15,167 --> 01:45:17,203
Start the cars!

707
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:31,581
Smoke comes!

708
01:46:13,292 --> 01:46:16,705
Take everyone to church,
I'll be there in 50 minutes.

709
01:46:16,875 --> 01:46:19,207
Kim is dead, Alex.

710
01:46:19,375 --> 01:46:20,911
Alex!

711
01:46:22,208 --> 01:46:23,539
Alex, hurry up!

712
01:46:23,708 --> 01:46:28,327
-We must go to church and get Åke.
-We must leave this place. Now.

713
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:31,116
Now you are listening to me, young man.

714
01:46:31,292 --> 01:46:34,455
We are not going anywhere without Åke.

715
01:46:36,458 --> 01:46:40,906
You run to the church and I pick up the car,
then we have to go away at once.

716
01:46:42,375 --> 01:46:48,746
Are everyone out? The cars are
down the hill, so hurry up!

717
01:46:48,917 --> 01:46:52,865
-What the hell, is nobody helping us?
-There is no help!

718
01:46:54,167 --> 01:46:56,954
What are you waiting for, Alex? Run!

719
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:36,915
Come on! Hurry up

720
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:39,615
Here, take a seat.

721
01:50:20,167 --> 01:50:21,657
Damn...

722
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:11,707
Damn, were are the keys?

723
01:52:00,958 --> 01:52:02,073
Stop!

724
01:54:14,083 --> 01:54:17,200
This I have done my son.

725
01:54:18,625 --> 01:54:21,662
He will be so damn happy.

726
01:56:39,958 --> 01:56:41,289
Alex!

727
01:56:42,042 --> 01:56:44,249
We must get away from the rain.

728
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:48,907
Kim is alive.

729
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:52,499
-He's on his way here.
-What?

730
01:56:52,667 --> 01:56:56,080
Sorry, I thought ...

731
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:01,698
I was thinking if you still thought Kim was dead-

732
01:57:01,875 --> 01:57:04,241
-that you should remember us.

733
01:57:45,667 --> 01:57:50,286
Do you think everything could have
been different if I had kept in touch?

734
01:57:53,458 --> 01:57:55,915
I just wish I had...

735
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,740
Anna...

736
02:02:18,625 --> 02:02:21,992
Okay. That is exactly what...

737
02:02:28,875 --> 02:02:31,912
After three days of resignation, we are now back-

738
02:02:32,083 --> 02:02:36,156
and most people can now watch television
broadcasts in most of the country.

739
02:02:38,875 --> 02:02:41,833
<i>All major hospitals should now have electricity back-</i>

740
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,447
<i>-but they are still heavily overloaded.</i>

741
02:02:45,625 --> 02:02:51,541
<i>The UN condemns the attack, which is one of
the worst against a civilian population ever.</i>

742
02:02:52,417 --> 02:02:56,490
<i>We continue our international partnerships
and cannot comment on...</i>

743
02:02:56,667 --> 02:02:59,704
<i>How long will foreign soldiers be on Swedish soil?</i>

744
02:02:59,875 --> 02:03:02,332
As long as the Swedish defense is weakened-

745
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:07,073
other countries must protect their financial interests here.

746
02:03:12,458 --> 02:03:16,246
<i>We are talking about a raid</i>

747
02:03:16,417 --> 02:03:21,707
<i>800,000 have lost the most important things we have:</i>

748
02:03:21,875 --> 02:03:23,866
<i>Our memories.</i>

749
02:03:24,042 --> 02:03:29,457
<i>And for what?</i> What could possibly
motivate up such a horrible act?

750
02:03:34,917 --> 02:03:37,499
Russia's economy will be more stable.

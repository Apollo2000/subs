1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,115
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

2
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:45,517
A FILM BY
DENNIS GANSEL

3
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,730
THE WAVE

4
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:08,277
Good morning.

5
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:15,827
Good morning.

6
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:25,070
Making sure the kids
don't smoke in the yard, huh?

7
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,943
Hi, honey.

8
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,628
Hey, my rocker!

9
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:34,181
You know we teachers are lazy, 
don't spoil our image.

10
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:37,260
Just doing some copying.
You seen Mrs Kohlhage?

11
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,458
No, why?

12
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,280
She was looking for you.

13
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,366
Better see what she wants.

14
00:02:44,394 --> 00:02:47,441
Autocracy? I thought there was a clear deal 
that I'll do the Anarchy class.

15
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:52,521
Mr Wieland showed me his outline for the whole week. 
It's well thought-out. 

16
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:56,684
- I'd have done mine this weekend.
- A bit late.

17
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,135
Wieland? 
Wieland doesn't have a clue about it.

18
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,499
I studied in Berlin.
I`ve lived five years in the last house in Kreuzberg.

19
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:06,668
May 1st demonstrations, always there.
I'm an expert.

20
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:10,144
If it's that important,
ask Mr Wieland to trade.

21
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:15,054
Couldn't you...?

22
00:03:15,648 --> 00:03:17,732
Work it out between yourselves.

23
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:24,505
Mr Wieland?

24
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,691
Mr Wenger.

25
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:29,973
- About the project subjects...
- Yes, and?

26
00:03:29,973 --> 00:03:33,695
Could you trade with me?
I'm doing autocracy.

27
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:35,779
<i>Alea iacta est.</i>

28
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,924
The die is cast.

29
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,705
You know I wanted to do anarchy.

30
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:44,925
A bit too much!

31
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:49,838
Project week is for showing the students
the virtues of democracy.

32
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:53,196
How to make Molotov cocktails...

33
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:55,830
maybe only in chemistry class.

34
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:57,876
Have a nice day.

35
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:04,096
I loved you. You betrayed me.

36
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:07,068
But I haven't forgotten
my dream of life, love and trust,

37
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:10,159
the dream that once was real.

38
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:15,453
I will build it with my fortune
by destroying you.

39
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:19,851
Hey, thanks for the daisies, babe.

40
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:23,580
They'll look great
when I'm lying in the box.

41
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,818
He's making a fool of himself.

42
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:28,420
Know what I'm sayin', babe?

43
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:34,684
"I'll take you to Capri in your coffin..."

44
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:38,393
- He's saying it wrong.
- It's what I want to say.

45
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:41,287
Ferdi, can't we do it right through for once?

46
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,521
You're the one who stopped.
First stage rule:

47
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:46,030
The show must go on!

48
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,357
Dennis, aren't we applying 
the play's criticism of capitalism to today?

49
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,273
That's why I'm updating the dialogue.

50
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,491
Okay, but don't make a joke out of it.

51
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:56,918
He can't assert himself.

52
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,607
Yeah, we're doing Drrenmatt,
not <i>Quatsch Comedy-Club.</i>

53
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:04,942
I thank you for the wreaths,
chrysanthemums and roses...

54
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:06,739
Noble.

55
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:10,647
That sounds like shit.
No way I'm saying that.

56
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:12,027
Forget it.

57
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:16,038
If Ferdi doesn't stick to his lines,
I can't do it.

58
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:22,783
I've had enough. Are you coming?

59
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:27,053
It's a pity they're not taking it seriously.

60
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:29,321
It's no use if everybody does what they want.

61
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:32,760
Coming to the game today?

62
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:35,365
Lisa and I have to study for Spanish.

63
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:37,555
Not all afternoon?

64
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:39,741
What did you sign up for?

65
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,411
Sign up?

66
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:43,178
Project week.

67
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,691
- Are the lists up already?
- Sure.

68
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:48,902
- I was thinking of autocracy.
- Me too.

69
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:50,910
Gotta go.

70
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,670
- Will you sign me up?
- For what?

71
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,624
- Whatever you take.
- Okay.

72
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:04,068
See you later.

73
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:27,551
Pull yourself together, okay?
I wanna see some real play.

74
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:30,271
Watch your defence and counter man to man. 
Got it?

75
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:33,560
Eight minutes left. We can do it!

76
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,982
Marco, that goes for you too.
Play as a team.

77
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:48,767
Let's go!

78
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,920
Mogli, move the ball up!

79
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:07,522
Nice, Marco!

80
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:11,963
Marco!
Sinan's wide open!

81
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:14,047
- Marco!
- Go for it! 

82
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:19,705
What are you doing, damn it?

83
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,789
Sinan was wide open!

84
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,054
Don't you want to score?

85
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,573
Martin, you tell me...

86
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:56,092
What are we supposed 
to rebel against nowadays?

87
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,657
Nothing means anything anymore.

88
00:08:58,657 --> 00:09:02,233
We all just want to have fun.

89
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:07,194
What our generation lacks
is a common goal to unite us.

90
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:09,733
That'd just be the <i>Zeitgeist.</i>
Look around.

91
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:15,515
The most Googled name on the Internet
is Paris Fucking Hilton!

92
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:18,223
- No shit.
- No shit.

93
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,986
Hey, let it out,
it`ll be better.

94
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,147
Stolte.

95
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,962
You got the dope today?

96
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:40,212
Sure I do.

97
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,737
- This is the real thing?
- Sure is.

98
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:48,823
A buddy brought it from Holland.

99
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,579
Are you nuts,
carrying that much dope?

100
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:55,731
Cops have to catch me first.

101
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,212
What do you want for it?

102
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:05,070
- Nothing.
- What?

103
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,964
It's free for you.
You're my homeys.

104
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,715
MONDAY

105
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,014
Baby.

106
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,100
The water's great, 
probably 16 degrees.

107
00:10:43,556 --> 00:10:45,639
Don't you want to go for a swim?

108
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,580
It'd do you good.

109
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,445
Maybe later.

110
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:51,184
How's your shoulder?

111
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,304
It's okay now.

112
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:54,389
Don't overdo it.

113
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,912
Yeah, sure.

114
00:10:57,955 --> 00:10:59,285
Coffee?

115
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,371
Sure, thanks.

116
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:08,876
Morning.

117
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:10,980
What's up?

118
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,066
- Okay, Rainer?
- Yeah.

119
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:15,838
- Morning, Rainer.
- Sinan.

120
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:22,336
I have to say I'm surprised so many of you
are interested in autocracy.

121
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:24,501
I'd have chosen anarchy.

122
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:27,818
- Lame Wieland?
- Your words, not mine!

123
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:31,421
So...

124
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:46,506
Autocracy. What does it mean?

125
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:50,849
Come on,
you signed up for this topic,

126
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:53,184
you must have certain expectations.

127
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:55,674
No hassles, I hope.

128
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:00,233
Jens, what do we mean
by autocratic government?

129
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:03,882
- Stuff like monarchy, I guess.
- Not necessarily.

130
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:05,862
Ferdi, what can you think of?

131
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,947
Autos that are crass!

132
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,356
That was pretty lame.

133
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:13,030
Lisa, don't let me down.

134
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,959
- Dictatorship, maybe? 
- That's part of it. Karo?

135
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,860
I think autocracy is when an individual 
or a group rules the masses.

136
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,470
Right.

137
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,009
Autocracy comes from the Greek
and means self-rule.

138
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,249
From <i>auto</i>, "self",
and <i>kratia</i>, "power", "rule"...

139
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:35,279
In an autocracy, the ruler 
or a group of rulers

140
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,165
have unlimited power
to change the law as they like.

141
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:40,556
Can you think of any examples?

142
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:44,587
Come on, a dictatorship! 

143
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:48,071
- The Third Reich.
- Not again.

144
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:51,857
I didn't pick the topic, but we have 
to get through this week together.

145
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:54,728
I printed out some things for you.

146
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:56,346
All that stuff again?

147
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:58,321
It's an important topic.

148
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,994
The Nazis sucked.
All right, we get it!

149
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:03,009
Right, shit nazis!

150
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:05,831
- And it's never gonna happen here again.
- What about Neo-Nazis?

151
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,687
We can't feel guilty forever,
for something we didn`t do.

152
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:13,226
We're not talking about guilt.
It's a historical responsibility.

153
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,476
Me a Turk, man!

154
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:18,641
- Okay, we all know!
- What do we know?

155
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,340
Except for some idiot East Germans...

156
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,742
Hey, I'm from the East!

157
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:24,732
You know what I mean, skinheads.

158
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:26,996
- Rainer, can't we do something else?
- Like? 

159
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:28,663
The Bush administration.

160
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:31,119
Wait, this is interesting.

161
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:34,514
You think another dictatorship
would be impossible in Germany?

162
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,657
We're way beyond that.

163
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,360
Marco, what do you think?

164
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,633
Beats me.

165
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:56,781
We'll take a ten-minute break.

166
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:20,683
What's the deal?

167
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:23,795
I changed the seating.
Now there's more room for everyone.

168
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,598
Bring your table behind.

169
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:37,194
Fortunately, we can do whatever we want 
during project week.

170
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:42,665
I propose we loosen things up a bit.
Any objections?

171
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:46,087
Very good.

172
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,904
What are the requirements
for an autocratic system?

173
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:52,198
Dennis?

174
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:54,855
- An ideology.
- Good. What else?

175
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:57,462
- Control.
- Surveillance.

176
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,547
You're getting ahead of yourselves.

177
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:01,528
Unhappiness.

178
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:03,560
Interesting.

179
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,779
What does every dictatorship need?
We already mentioned it.

180
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:09,337
A <i>Fhrer</i>, man!

181
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:10,170
A <i>Fhrer?</i>

182
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,409
A word with lots of baggage.

183
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,932
But every dictatorship has a central figure.

184
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:18,541
Let's go through this.
Who would that be here?

185
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:20,277
- You, the teacher.
- Me?  

186
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:22,107
Who else?

187
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:24,687
One of you, for a change.

188
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,217
I'll be the leader.

189
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:34,853
No way! Rainer, you do it.

190
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:35,895
Let's vote.

191
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:38,664
Who wants me as your project leader?

192
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:41,286
- What is this?
- Play along.

193
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:44,241
Who's against? Any nays?

194
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,096
Abstentions?

195
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,845
- Good.
- <i>Heil</i> Rainer!

196
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:54,116
Of course, a leader deserves respect.

197
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:58,884
So you'll address me as Mr Wenger
for project week.

198
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:02,370
- Mr Wenger...
- Is he a megalomaniac now?

199
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:04,667
We just voted on it, didn't we?

200
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:08,204
- East German commie!
- Get with the programme!

201
00:16:08,204 --> 00:16:10,289
Don't tell me what to do, bitch!

202
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:13,099
Watch your mouth, scumbag!

203
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:16,338
Quiet!
Clear off your desks.

204
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:19,698
From now on,
no one talks without permission.

205
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,416
- Yes, sir!
- Did I give you permission?

206
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:24,780
No.

207
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,373
If you want to speak,
you'll stand up first.

208
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,819
- Isn't that going a bit far?
- Mona?

209
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,621
Isn't that going a bit far,
Mr Wenger?

210
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,522
- Feel anything?
- What?

211
00:16:38,522 --> 00:16:40,608
Standing up gets your circulation going.

212
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,674
It's blood pressure.

213
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:45,666
If you stand up, you wake up
and your concentration improves.

214
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,543
You can sit down again.

215
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,617
Marco. You're tired from training,
but try sitting up straight.

216
00:16:55,617 --> 00:17:00,843
Straighten your spine,
place your feet parallel and breathe deeply.

217
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:04,263
Feel the difference?

218
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:06,552
Marco.

219
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:11,256
Yes, Mr Wenger.
It's better.

220
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,977
That's right,
you can breathe better.

221
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,176
Let's all do the same.

222
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,938
Everybody get up.

223
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,674
- Come on!
- What is this?

224
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,759
Breathe deeply.

225
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,955
Up you get.

226
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:28,040
Breathe in...

227
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,033
and out.

228
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,700
- What's with you?
- No way!

229
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,826
Then leave, please.

230
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:41,927
No one's forcing you to stay.
Attendance is voluntary.

231
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,311
- Rainer, be cool.
- Mr Wenger.

232
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:50,944
Kevin, it's very simple.
Either play along or leave.

233
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,399
Well?

234
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,691
This is weirding me out.

235
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,121
Come on, Sinan.
Bomber.

236
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:14,845
Later daze!

237
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,981
You can sit down again.

238
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:22,629
What else is important for a dictatorship?

239
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:30,067
- Discipline, Mr Wenger.
- Very good, Tim.

240
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,152
Power through discipline.

241
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:37,356
Let's go shoot some pool.

242
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:43,255
I've got a better idea.

243
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:47,560
Man, what's that?
What happened to your M-class?

244
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,931
It's my mom's, a wedding anniversary gift 
from my father.

245
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:53,209
V-8, 250 bhp, 150 mph.

246
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,506
Wanna take this baby
for a spin on the highway?

247
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:01,320
What's with you?

248
00:19:01,646 --> 00:19:05,074
- I'm not coming.
- What do you mean?

249
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:06,549
I'm going back.

250
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,239
Have you completely lost your mind 
or what?

251
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:10,536
I've already failed twice.

252
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,671
You know what happens
if I don't graduate?

253
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,739
You're no honours student either.

254
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:21,266
I'm glad you changed your mind.

255
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:23,461
Have a seat in the back.

256
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:26,176
Thanks... Mr Wenger.

257
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:32,640
We were discussing which social conditions
favour a dictatorship.

258
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,184
Lisa?

259
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:49,436
- Which social conditions are necessary?
- Could you speak up, please? 

260
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:52,845
Well, like, if there's injustice....

261
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,684
and, like, people don't know...
I mean, no jobs and stuff.

262
00:19:58,204 --> 00:20:00,288
Hey, Ferdi! 
What's the big idea?

263
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:02,925
Lisa, please just sit down again.

264
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:05,968
Take a deep breath.

265
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:08,726
Think what you're going to say.
Keep your answer short.

266
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:11,223
I know you can do it.

267
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,307
Try it again, okay?

268
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,079
High unemployment and social injustice.

269
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:20,763
Excellent. 
High unemployment and social injustice,

270
00:20:21,338 --> 00:20:23,590
certainly would favour a dictatorship.

271
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:26,942
Tim?

272
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:28,835
High inflation, Mr Wenger.

273
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:30,097
Good. Inflation.

274
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:32,788
- Political disillusionment.
- Very good, Karo.

275
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:34,037
Nationalism.

276
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:38,104
We saw it during the World Cup,
there were German flags everywhere.

277
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:40,767
- But that was great!
- I thought it was revolting.

278
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:43,587
That's what rocked about the World Cup!

279
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:49,125
If Germans can't be proud of their country, 
like anyone else,

280
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,211
it just leads to the reverse,

281
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:53,429
to hatred of everybody else.

282
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:59,487
I think Mona means extreme nationalism.
Can we agree on that?

283
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:07,017
That was awesome today.
Thank you. 

284
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,813
Sr. Wenger?

285
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:11,897
After class call me Rainer again.

286
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,109
I really enjoyed it today.

287
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:16,236
Keep up your contributions.

288
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,321
Yes sir, Mr Wenger!

289
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,490
Watch it!

290
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,376
Why don't you watch it?

291
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,139
Be nice to your sister.

292
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:37,963
Just gimme a light!

293
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,590
- You shouldn't smoke.
- My dad says I can.

294
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,019
I've got a light.

295
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:45,165
Torsten just said it's up to you.

296
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:47,249
None of your business, anyway.

297
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,874
Ignore the little weirdo.

298
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,062
- Retard!
- You're the retard!

299
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,148
Don't you have a home of your own?

300
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,518
Hi, hon.

301
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:07,091
Hi, sweetie.

302
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:08,642
You thirsty, too?

303
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:23,688
Aren't you going to ask me how it went?

304
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:27,918
How did it go?

305
00:22:27,918 --> 00:22:30,035
It was totally fascinating.

306
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:32,293
Mr Wenger taught us how to sit properly.

307
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:35,055
Upright, with your spine straight.

308
00:22:35,628 --> 00:22:39,663
You know when you stand up quickly
and your vision goes all blurry?

309
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:42,248
That's because your pulse is low.

310
00:22:42,248 --> 00:22:44,233
More roast?

311
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:48,443
Now we have to stand up to speak.
It's good for your circulation,

312
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:50,844
and our answers must always be 
short and concise.

313
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:53,315
Good. Why don't you, then?

314
00:22:56,262 --> 00:23:00,764
There was this bizarre energy,
everybody was caught up in it.

315
00:23:00,969 --> 00:23:03,524
"Bizarre" is right.

316
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:05,440
What's that supposed to mean?

317
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,525
"Power through discipline"...

318
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:12,387
Karo, honey, 
that's not how we raised you.

319
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,352
Maybe you should have.
Leon could use a bit of discipline.

320
00:23:16,892 --> 00:23:18,976
Your brother needs to learn his own limits.

321
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:21,367
It doesn't work for everyone.

322
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:22,836
Why?

323
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,920
Kevin, for example, 
I had to kick him out of class.

324
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,109
I'll kick your ass!

325
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,854
Get off it! Rainer's cool.

326
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:34,812
- You traitor!
- I'd have kicked you out too.

327
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:37,332
Besides, Rainer didn't kick you out,
Mr Wenger did.

328
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:42,887
He never liked me 'cause I'm not 
in his faggy water-polo team.

329
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:45,643
What do you guys do there?

330
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:48,601
We practise hard.
I don't know why we're losing.

331
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:55,173
We have to beat Ernst-Barlach-Gesamtschule,
or we'll lose our league standing.

332
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:57,763
Come by sometime.

333
00:23:57,763 --> 00:23:59,359
When's your next game?

334
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,444
Marco, let's go to my room.

335
00:24:01,794 --> 00:24:03,710
We're watching the race.

336
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,795
We can watch it in my room.

337
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:08,127
We have our project assignment.

338
00:24:08,668 --> 00:24:11,966
- What assignment?
- Are you coming?

339
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:15,340
Sorry, Torsten.

340
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,263
You go study for your project assignment.

341
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:22,317
Hey, my little honeybee.

342
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:25,947
What say we do our own 
"project assignment"?

343
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,313
I hear role-playing
can be pretty stimulating. 

344
00:24:35,397 --> 00:24:37,482
I thought we were going
to do something else.

345
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,608
Here, check this out.

346
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:43,884
Here's where we'll go.

347
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:48,156
The hippest part of Barcelona,
only seven stations to the soccer stadium.

348
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:51,967
Isn't it a bit far?

349
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:54,051
Seven stations?

350
00:24:55,257 --> 00:24:56,762
Barcelona.

351
00:24:56,762 --> 00:25:00,297
It's beautiful, right on the sea.
An artist's city.

352
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:05,306
Wouldn't your family miss you?

353
00:25:05,306 --> 00:25:07,541
They get on my nerves.

354
00:25:07,848 --> 00:25:09,672
Torsten and Bine are cool.

355
00:25:09,672 --> 00:25:11,757
Sometimes they're too cool for me.

356
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,668
Stop whining.

357
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,754
Come here.

358
00:25:19,588 --> 00:25:21,672
I'm not in the mood.

359
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:24,031
You're not moving tomorrow.
What's the hurry?

360
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:26,368
I have to sign up soon.

361
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:30,145
Then sign up.

362
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:33,171
Come on, don't go yet.

363
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:35,722
I've got practice.

364
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:22,481
Wait, not here. Come on.

365
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:37,241
Man, what kind of shit is this? 
What is that?

366
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:45,093
Damn it! 
You can`t do everything you want in here.

367
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:47,177
When you´ll finally understand that?

368
00:26:47,699 --> 00:26:49,534
- Listen, man...
- Leave me alone.

369
00:26:49,534 --> 00:26:53,314
Let's play together. 
Everyone will expect you to hog the ball.

370
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:56,400
I'll swim into the clear on the left
and pass back to you, okay?

371
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:05,479
Get out! Slo, you play.

372
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,860
Nice, Marco!
That's better.

373
00:27:25,508 --> 00:27:27,593
Great move, with class!

374
00:27:27,593 --> 00:27:29,763
Finally!

375
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:33,615
Hi, sweetie, I'm home.

376
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:40,168
What's going on?

377
00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:42,884
I just want to print something.

378
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:46,779
Kiki and Alex are really a pain in the ass,
a real couple of teachers.

379
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,878
Are we like them?

380
00:27:53,113 --> 00:27:54,545
What's all this for?

381
00:27:54,545 --> 00:27:56,692
Just a few ideas I want to try out tomorrow.

382
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:00,611
I have a few ideas too!

383
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:08,611
Only if you wear a nurse costume.

384
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:10,095
We'll see.

385
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:12,179
How about an injection?

386
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:14,871
I've got an injection that's all ready to go!

387
00:28:15,913 --> 00:28:17,040
- Really? 
- Yes.

388
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,125
Let's see it, then.

389
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,310
TUESDAY

390
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,074
Here he comes. 

391
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:35,134
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr Wenger.

392
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:41,614
I have a feeling you don't
take me seriously, do you?

393
00:28:41,614 --> 00:28:43,132
No, of course we do.

394
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:45,217
Everybody stand up, please.

395
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:47,476
Now do as I do.

396
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:52,592
These are a few warm-up exercises
to loosen up your muscles.

397
00:28:53,544 --> 00:28:55,628
Especially the legs.

398
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:58,316
And now in unison.

399
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:01,643
Left, right...

400
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,730
What is this for?

401
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,813
I want to show you something.

402
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,418
Good.

403
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,772
You feel it?

404
00:29:14,772 --> 00:29:17,277
We're becoming a single unit.

405
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,423
That's the power of unity.

406
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,905
- How long do we keep this up?
- Until we're in step.

407
00:29:27,905 --> 00:29:29,885
You know that from dancing, Mona.

408
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:32,330
Left, right...

409
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:36,149
A rhythm like this
can cause bridges to collapse.

410
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:39,433
- Kaschi, you're out of step.
- Chill, man!

411
00:29:40,293 --> 00:29:42,377
I think we get it, Mr Wenger.

412
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:44,587
I don`t think so.

413
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:47,749
- This exercise has another purpose.
- What's that?

414
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:49,913
Wieland's anarchy class is below us.

415
00:29:51,562 --> 00:29:55,417
I want the plaster to fall off the ceiling 
onto our "enemy" heads!

416
00:29:56,572 --> 00:29:58,656
Excellent!

417
00:30:09,217 --> 00:30:11,301
Have they gone crazy?

418
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:16,974
Unity is power.

419
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:20,577
You want to know 
why I rearranged the seating?

420
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,536
To break up your usual cliques.

421
00:30:24,476 --> 00:30:27,627
You all have your friends and groups.
That's important.

422
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:30,306
You can't get through life all by yourself,

423
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:32,655
but together, we are much, much stronger.

424
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:35,980
The new seating has a method to it.

425
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,122
Do you know what it is?

426
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:40,467
Anyone?

427
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:43,277
Karo, why are you sitting next to Jens 
and not Marco?

428
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:46,249
Because Marco and I distract each other?

429
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:48,334
Oh, do you?

430
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:54,518
Wieland down there wants to foster his students
by making them lone warriors.

431
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:58,054
You know what I mean.
No one letting the other copy.

432
00:30:58,343 --> 00:31:00,635
I say that leads to social Darwinism.

433
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:03,442
I'm convinced if we pull together,

434
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:05,568
we'll be much stronger.

435
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:07,686
So we can copy from each other?

436
00:31:07,943 --> 00:31:10,090
If it means better grades, yes.

437
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:13,574
That's why I've checked your grades,

438
00:31:13,574 --> 00:31:15,834
and seated the good grades 
next to the bad.

439
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:18,054
I want you to help each other.

440
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:20,033
That's total nonsense!

441
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:22,118
- Mona?
- I don't believe it. 

442
00:31:22,118 --> 00:31:24,375
Please stand up.

443
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:28,961
You wouldn't embarrass us like this.

444
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,068
All the poor students are lined up 
like ducks in a row.

445
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:35,479
I never said anything about poor students,

446
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,564
just poor grades.

447
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:40,532
There are no poor students.

448
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:44,077
For example, you're good in my class,
but you struggle in math.

449
00:31:44,248 --> 00:31:46,741
Lisa, however, is a math whiz.

450
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:49,910
You could help each other.

451
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,994
There's another advantage.

452
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:55,431
The whole class would do better,

453
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:57,875
at least better 
than the anarchists downstairs.

454
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:02,217
I know it's unorthodox...

455
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:05,592
but why not try something new?

456
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:10,872
Hey, Domi. 
We were pretty loud, huh?

457
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:14,527
How's it going with Wieland,
our Bavarian?

458
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:19,081
I thought anarchy would be interesting,
but he just blows.

459
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:21,218
He is like a sleeping pill.

460
00:32:21,218 --> 00:32:23,702
If you guys hadn't raised hell,
I would've dozed off.

461
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,713
What was that?

462
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:27,993
A little calisthenics to wake them up.

463
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:29,522
Calisthenics?

464
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:31,560
I thought the building was going to collapse.

465
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,379
You disrupt my classes. 
My students are outraged, and justly so.

466
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:36,735
Can I help you kids?

467
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:40,793
We wanted to ask if we can switch
to the autocracy class.

468
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:43,301
Right away, if possible.

469
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:51,117
We were talking about group unity.

470
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:53,200
What are the signs of group unity?

471
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:57,527
Team spirit, Mr Wenger.

472
00:32:57,527 --> 00:32:59,695
Good, but I meant visual signs.

473
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:01,015
Lisa? 

474
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:05,765
- Dress, Mr Wenger?
- Exactly, a common way of dressing.

475
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:09,274
One could also say by uniforms.

476
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:11,286
Uniforms suck.

477
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:13,370
Dominik?

478
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,819
I mean, uniforms are totally fascistic.

479
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:20,026
It might be so,
but not necessarily military uniforms.

480
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:24,337
There are all kinds of uniforms everywhere:
McDonald's, stewardesses, meter maids...

481
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:26,910
even business suits are a dress code.

482
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:29,968
Your outfit is a kind of uniform too.

483
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,119
It indicates your social group.

484
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:36,285
Lisa?

485
00:33:37,535 --> 00:33:39,619
Uniforms can serve another purpose.

486
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:42,386
They eliminate social differences.

487
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,175
Yes, they do, 
but also they eliminate individuality.

488
00:33:46,043 --> 00:33:48,127
Mona, please stand up.

489
00:33:49,622 --> 00:33:51,704
Lisa, explain it more accurately.

490
00:33:52,017 --> 00:33:56,472
Well, I mean, we all stress out
every morning over what to wear.

491
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:59,889
If we all wore a uniform,
we wouldn't have to.

492
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:01,290
Karo? 

493
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:05,058
I've heard that in Hamburg they're talking
about reintroducing school uniforms.

494
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:07,246
Does that make sense?

495
00:34:07,973 --> 00:34:08,693
Sinan? 

496
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:13,858
Sure, but they'd have to be cheap enough 
for everyone to afford.

497
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:18,589
Marco, why don't you tell everybody?

498
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,999
I was saying... 

499
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:31,051
Stephon Marbury of New York Knicks, 
made a basketball shoe that cost only $14.99.

500
00:34:31,714 --> 00:34:33,799
The "Starbury One".

501
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:38,079
He was a ghetto kid and wanted a shoe
kids could afford,

502
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,674
instead of expensive Nike Airs.

503
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:43,745
A good example.
How can he market them so cheaply?

504
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,561
Because they're made
in Chinese slave factories.

505
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:49,830
No, they just do 
without expensive ad campaigns.

506
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:53,565
Nike spends hundreds of millions on ads.

507
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,357
David Beckham got millions from Adidas.

508
00:34:58,177 --> 00:35:04,115
What say we adopt a school uniform
for the duration of project week?

509
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,341
Like what?

510
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:09,120
Maybe a pair of jeans, a white shirt.
Everyone has that.

511
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:12,899
- I don't have a white shirt.
- Then buy one.

512
00:35:12,899 --> 00:35:15,381
I'm not spending money for that.

513
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:17,182
Come on, how much can it cost?

514
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,265
Jens, stand up, please.

515
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:23,816
I've got two.
You can have one of mine.

516
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:26,196
That's what I call team spirit, Jens!

517
00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:28,281
Very good!

518
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,012
It's decided, then.

519
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,053
- Two of the same?
- Right.

520
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:53,138
I just had sold a white one.

521
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:55,064
110, please.

522
00:35:55,064 --> 00:35:55,967
Thank you.

523
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,049
- Bye.
- Your receipt? 

524
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:00,134
- No, no, its okay, thank you.
- Okay, bye. 

525
00:36:05,014 --> 00:36:07,058
- Hello!
- Hello!

526
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,504
These must really be hip.

527
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:10,719
45, please.

528
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:22,958
Excuse me, but my things
may be in here, too.

529
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:27,490
Where are you going in that?

530
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,594
Why?

531
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:31,679
You look like you just went out 
of the convent school.

532
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:35,072
Well, I like it.

533
00:37:11,955 --> 00:37:14,040
WEDNESDAY 

534
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,731
Where's your white shirt?

535
00:37:16,731 --> 00:37:17,774
I didn't like it.

536
00:37:17,774 --> 00:37:21,340
- Why not?
- I just don't look good in white.

537
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:25,511
So that's it, a matter of vanity.

538
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:28,434
I don't have to explain why I don't want to wear 
some shitty shirt!

539
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,227
That's just what Mr Wenger
was talking about.

540
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:34,789
Pure egoism.

541
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:53,525
Karo, but we have already agreed 
we all take part in this.

542
00:37:53,525 --> 00:37:55,611
Mind your own business!

543
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:58,640
White does not suit her.

544
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:06,120
- Good morning.
- Good morning. 

545
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:10,019
Mona has switched classes,
but we have more newcomers. 

546
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:12,191
Go ahead and find a seat.

547
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:14,270
We're definitely full now.

548
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,798
But Jules Barman and Frederick Claussen 
wanted to join us too.

549
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:18,665
Unfortunately, full means full.

550
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:20,643
Dennis? 

551
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:23,855
Now that we're so many,
we need a name, don't we?

552
00:38:24,294 --> 00:38:27,766
Excellent. That was my next topic.
Any suggestions?

553
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,755
Sinan? 

554
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:32,839
"Terror Squad".

555
00:38:33,152 --> 00:38:34,888
Serious suggestions only.

556
00:38:34,888 --> 00:38:36,207
Dennis? 

557
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:38,291
"Visionary Club".

558
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,784
Marco? 

559
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,849
- "The Wave".
- I expected that one from you!

560
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:46,105
- It's great. It fits.
- True. Tim?

561
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:48,103
"Tsunami".

562
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:50,187
That's overdoing it.

563
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:51,440
Kaschi? 

564
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,123
"The Base".

565
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,359
"The Pact".

566
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,235
"The White Giant".

567
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:57,295
"The Inner Circle".

568
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:59,381
"The Risen".

569
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:03,231
- "The Centre".
- That's good too.

570
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,672
Anyone else?

571
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:11,199
No one?

572
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:17,503
Karo? 

573
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:20,442
"The Changers".

574
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,643
"The Changers"?

575
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:26,763
That's quite a few.
I'll write some down.

576
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:33,016
"The Visionary Club"... 

577
00:39:35,518 --> 00:39:37,103
"The Base"...

578
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:43,862
Okay, last suggestion...
"The Changers".

579
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:49,276
We have a winner.
From now on we are "The Wave".

580
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:58,580
That's really good.

581
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,143
Helps me concentrate.
Honest.

582
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:02,432
I like it.
Why not design a logo for us?

583
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,331
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You design our logo.

584
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,476
That brings us to the next step:
Power by Action

585
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,509
What's the use of great ideas
if we don't actually do something?

586
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:18,452
I want everyone to contribute to "The Wave", 
for the greater good.

587
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:20,559
I'll set up a profile on "MySpace" for us.

588
00:40:20,805 --> 00:40:22,903
- Great!
- I always wanted to do that.

589
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:24,444
Do it together.

590
00:40:24,444 --> 00:40:27,080
No, I'd rather do something 
on my own.

591
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:29,401
Why don't you make a website?

592
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:32,248
We can make badges with the logo.

593
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:34,249
My aunt has a machine.

594
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:36,335
We could have tattoos, on our arms.

595
00:40:36,962 --> 00:40:38,366
Postcards to hand out...

596
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:08,553
Hey, what's up?

597
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,496
A friend of mine is out of stash.

598
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:14,213
I heard you can get dope.

599
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:17,740
Hey, my money's good.

600
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,826
Go buy it on the street.

601
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,983
What's going down over there?

602
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:31,372
They're fucking with Stoltefuss.

603
00:41:31,372 --> 00:41:33,454
I don't sell dope to anarchist lice.

604
00:41:34,537 --> 00:41:36,620
What's that mean?

605
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:43,469
Check out his pretty shirt.
Mommy buy it for you?

606
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:44,814
Leave me alone, you fucks!

607
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:46,900
Hey, take it easy.
Everything's cool.

608
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,360
Is there a problem here?

609
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:56,387
- Two more weirdoes.
- What?

610
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:58,473
This a gang thing?

611
00:41:58,473 --> 00:42:00,558
If you don't leave Tim alone,
we'll kick your ass.

612
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:03,057
Everything`s cool.

613
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:06,102
Fucking fascists!

614
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:11,767
Those anarchist fags tore my shirt.

615
00:42:12,242 --> 00:42:14,995
Don't let those scumbags push you around.

616
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:19,207
- You got my back.
- And if we're not here?

617
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:24,223
Tim, listen, let me give you my number.

618
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,276
If those bastards trouble you,
you gimme a call, okay?

619
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,298
Sure.

620
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:42,151
What was that earlier?

621
00:42:43,204 --> 00:42:46,147
I really don't know,
she's upset about something.

622
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:50,236
I can't get through to her.

623
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:52,931
I've noticed that too, recently.

624
00:42:53,731 --> 00:42:55,814
It bothers me when she tells me what to do.

625
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:00,912
She makes plans without bothering to ask me.

626
00:43:02,485 --> 00:43:04,569
Why should I even follow her to Spain?

627
00:43:05,153 --> 00:43:10,631
Ten months from now she'll have some guy
named Juan or Miguel or whatever.

628
00:43:16,617 --> 00:43:18,699
I'm scared I'll lose her.

629
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:30,782
Karo, this is Dennis. Where are you?
It's total chaos. 

630
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:34,016
Call me back when you get this message, okay?

631
00:43:44,146 --> 00:43:46,206
- Voicemail.
- Like I said.

632
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,289
But she knows we're rehearsing today.

633
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:51,308
No big loss.

634
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:55,295
I bet she's pissed off 
because nobody voted for "The Changers".

635
00:43:55,295 --> 00:43:58,815
I'm not sitting around all day
waiting for our little princess.

636
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:01,027
I'm going with you.

637
00:44:01,027 --> 00:44:02,722
Hey, wait a minute.

638
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:04,806
Lisa, I'm going too.

639
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:12,250
If you leave now, we can forget the play!
Is that what you want?

640
00:44:12,888 --> 00:44:15,458
I think we can create
something really great here.

641
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,224
A play that means something.

642
00:44:20,182 --> 00:44:22,266
Not just entertainment,
but a message.

643
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:25,101
But not without Karo.

644
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:27,263
You wanted her to play the lead!

645
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,549
I was against that consensus rule
from the beginning!

646
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:31,968
I thought we should have real auditions.

647
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,553
We never really voted on it, anyway.

648
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:38,195
Could you all be quiet for a moment!?

649
00:44:41,322 --> 00:44:45,559
Let's do it the way I say,
just once.

650
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:50,356
Your big break, Maja.
You're Claire Zachanassian.

651
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:53,282
- Cool.
- And Lisa, you play Maja's role.

652
00:44:53,282 --> 00:44:54,249
Me?

653
00:44:54,249 --> 00:44:56,587
Sure. You know the part.
Just go for it.

654
00:44:57,734 --> 00:45:01,854
And Ferdi, stick to the text
and don't clown around for once, okay?

655
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,055
Yes, sir! 

656
00:45:21,015 --> 00:45:23,098
Man, I'm glad this day's over.

657
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:25,902
But Rainer has really showed us 
cool stuff today.

658
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:30,233
You should join up again.
"The Wave" needs you, man.

659
00:45:31,758 --> 00:45:33,943
How will that look?

660
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:37,521
You don't have to come to class,
just join us.

661
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,585
Hey, let us also in!

662
00:45:47,585 --> 00:45:49,896
- What do you want?
- To skate!

663
00:45:49,896 --> 00:45:52,184
You're that bitch Karo's brother.

664
00:45:52,385 --> 00:45:55,935
- Got a problem with that?
- Your sister is a cunt.

665
00:45:55,935 --> 00:45:58,024
Tell me something new.

666
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:02,804
The pipe belongs to "The Wave".
You want to skate, you have to join.

667
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:11,421
<i>... sits in the forest for the last time,
full of cuckoos and howling winds.</i> 

668
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,381
<i>Tonight, the congregation will assemble.</i>

669
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,988
Dennis said I was really good.

670
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:19,671
<i>You tricked me.</i> 

671
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:21,000
And now Maja has my role?

672
00:46:21,298 --> 00:46:23,000
<i>The dream of life...</i> 

673
00:46:23,006 --> 00:46:25,090
Well, it was just to try it out.

674
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:26,848
<i>once the real dream...</i> 

675
00:46:26,848 --> 00:46:28,128
Where were you?

676
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:30,214
<i>that I had not forget.</i> 

677
00:46:30,214 --> 00:46:31,514
I wasn't feeling good.

678
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:37,522
<i>I thank you for the wreaths,
chrysanthemums and roses.</i> 

679
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:40,562
And Ferdi's sticking to the text?

680
00:46:40,562 --> 00:46:43,348
Dennis finally put his foot down.

681
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:46,715
You're all against me,
in your white shirts.

682
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:50,096
- That's nonsense!
- Since I wasn`t around, it's working now.

683
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:53,668
Just because we voted against your name.

684
00:46:53,948 --> 00:46:54,737
What?

685
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:57,284
Can't you see that you are getting
on everybody's nerves with your way.

686
00:46:57,494 --> 00:46:58,742
Are you nuts?

687
00:46:58,742 --> 00:47:02,696
Has it ever occurred to you
Marco may not want to go to Spain?

688
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:05,683
- Why do you say that?
- He told me.

689
00:47:05,683 --> 00:47:07,593
What else did he tell you?

690
00:47:07,593 --> 00:47:09,678
How often we make it?

691
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,971
You suck, you know that?

692
00:47:11,971 --> 00:47:13,421
I suck?

693
00:47:13,421 --> 00:47:16,473
What if I talked to your boyfriend 
about your relationship problems?

694
00:47:16,473 --> 00:47:19,201
I have no relationship problems
since I don't have a boyfriend.

695
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,688
You don't even have a friend,
in case you hadn't noticed.

696
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:23,923
It's all about you.

697
00:47:24,534 --> 00:47:27,811
You know what?
Maja was much better than you,

698
00:47:28,031 --> 00:47:30,091
but you don't care about that.

699
00:47:30,091 --> 00:47:33,021
You're pissed off because 
you're not top dog in "The Wave".

700
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:36,889
A shitty feeling, isn't it?
Get used to it!

701
00:47:43,252 --> 00:47:45,237
- Hello.
- Hi. 

702
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,321
Wait a sec, 
I want to show you something.

703
00:47:48,754 --> 00:47:50,532
- Here.
- What is it?

704
00:47:50,532 --> 00:47:52,416
You know what a computer junkie Kaschi is?

705
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:54,901
He made us a "MySpace" page,
we are already on-line.

706
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:57,090
- Cool, huh!
- Super cool!

707
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:04,693
- Honey.
- Yes?

708
00:48:04,693 --> 00:48:06,429
Kaschi's totally motivated.

709
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:08,514
The kids are changing.

710
00:48:08,863 --> 00:48:13,347
Sure, like all wearing white shirts!

711
00:48:13,347 --> 00:48:15,329
Okay, I forgot to change.

712
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:17,412
They already talk about you 
at the faculty.

713
00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:22,257
Haven't they always?
Since when do you care?

714
00:48:22,257 --> 00:48:24,343
I'm just saying.

715
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,336
- That's our sign.
- Cool.

716
00:49:25,336 --> 00:49:27,733
As a "Wave", 
we will flood the whole City!

717
00:49:45,578 --> 00:49:48,406
It really rules on a wall, guys.
My respect!

718
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,174
What's he doing here?

719
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:54,645
What's your problem, retard?
Be glad you're in.

720
00:49:54,645 --> 00:49:56,236
Peace, guys!

721
00:49:56,236 --> 00:49:59,391
Anyone can join "The Wave"
who believes in the cause.

722
00:49:59,391 --> 00:50:01,180
Tim's right.

723
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,533
Kevin bailed.
Why the change of mind?

724
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,906
Chill!
Kevin had 5,000 stickers printed.

725
00:50:06,906 --> 00:50:08,839
That shows he's worthy.

726
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,923
Sure, sponsored by daddy.

727
00:50:11,179 --> 00:50:13,574
I think Mr Wenger should decide 
if he is still involved or not.

728
00:50:14,142 --> 00:50:17,744
Mr Wenger taught us about unity.
Only together we are strong.

729
00:50:17,744 --> 00:50:19,007
I don't know about you guys, 

730
00:50:19,044 --> 00:50:21,807
but I bet Mr Wenger wouldn't like us 
hacking the whole town.

731
00:50:21,807 --> 00:50:26,077
You're getting too uptight.
I thought we were here to have fun.

732
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:28,725
Well? 

733
00:50:39,727 --> 00:50:42,343
Okay, grab the stuff and let's go.

734
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:46,186
Everyone got stickers? 

735
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:48,946
Here is the template.
I've got five pieces.

736
00:50:53,943 --> 00:50:55,986
- Let`s go!
- Can we go with you?

737
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:58,069
Get into the car, we're moving!

738
00:52:09,954 --> 00:52:12,037
What's going on? 
Are you crazy?

739
00:52:20,059 --> 00:52:22,143
Guys, wait a bit.

740
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:24,518
What's wrong, retard?

741
00:52:24,518 --> 00:52:26,883
Lets cover up the anarchy clowns' scribbles.

742
00:52:27,457 --> 00:52:29,541
Righteous!

743
00:53:02,672 --> 00:53:04,937
Don't worry about it,
she could have come along.

744
00:53:10,857 --> 00:53:12,942
- Speak of the devil.
- Leave it.

745
00:53:12,942 --> 00:53:15,455
If you are always available to her, 
she may become bored.

746
00:53:16,136 --> 00:53:18,855
Trust me.
I'm a girl, I know how we think.

747
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:22,995
Come on Marco, lets go!

748
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,065
Know what would rock?
Spraying "The Wave" up there.

749
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:46,639
How cool would that be?

750
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:48,204
Lets move.

751
00:53:48,204 --> 00:53:50,287
I'll do it.

752
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:51,319
What?

753
00:53:54,787 --> 00:53:56,016
I'll climb up there.

754
00:53:56,016 --> 00:53:58,007
Stop fucking around.

755
00:53:58,007 --> 00:54:00,093
Forget it, man.

756
00:54:34,386 --> 00:54:36,353
Give me your cellphone.

757
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:38,439
- Got video?
- Yeah.

758
00:54:44,904 --> 00:54:46,988
This guy is so whacked.

759
00:54:47,088 --> 00:54:48,090
Totally. 

760
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:51,236
He even filmed his sister getting laid.

761
00:54:51,576 --> 00:54:54,263
- He doesn't have a sister.
- What?

762
00:54:54,263 --> 00:54:56,345
I know Stoltefuss from way back,
from camp.

763
00:54:56,345 --> 00:54:59,528
When he was young, the first time 
he tried alcohol he ended up in a coma.

764
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:02,661
He's got a older brother,
a computer geek at the university,

765
00:55:02,661 --> 00:55:04,270
but no sister.

766
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:23,276
Tim!
Don't fuck up!

767
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,955
Shit, it's the cops!

768
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:19,032
THURSDAY

769
00:56:23,054 --> 00:56:24,054
Mom.

770
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:28,259
You really made a mess!

771
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:34,007
I'd never have climbed up there.

772
00:56:34,399 --> 00:56:36,483
I wet my pants on the diving board.

773
00:56:36,483 --> 00:56:38,762
Heights don't freak me out.

774
00:56:40,946 --> 00:56:43,154
- Here, guys.
- Thanks.

775
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,195
Nope. "Wave" members only.

776
00:56:47,528 --> 00:56:48,248
What?

777
00:56:50,442 --> 00:56:52,303
Just kidding. Go ahead.

778
00:56:52,303 --> 00:56:54,561
Stick your shitty ice cream in your ass. 

779
00:56:58,728 --> 00:57:00,320
I'm in.

780
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,340
You know what the initiation is, right?

781
00:57:04,415 --> 00:57:06,055
Don't listen to the retard.

782
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:08,966
Hey, Turk, you got a big mouth
in your white shirt.

783
00:57:14,494 --> 00:57:18,343
Hey guys, what you think of this?

784
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,881
A really cool "Wave" salute.
Very simple.

785
00:57:22,611 --> 00:57:23,871
As our salute?

786
00:57:23,871 --> 00:57:26,893
All groups have their own salute,
like "Black Power".

787
00:57:27,136 --> 00:57:28,981
- West Coast.
- East Coast, man!

788
00:57:28,981 --> 00:57:30,229
That's Eminem.

789
00:57:30,229 --> 00:57:32,108
No, this is Eminem.

790
00:57:32,108 --> 00:57:34,086
- Hang loose.
- Or Satan.

791
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:36,171
Don't forget the Vulcans.

792
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:38,363
Okay, great.

793
00:57:38,363 --> 00:57:40,021
Can you show me again? This way?

794
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:43,154
Not so high at the end.
Under the chest, here.

795
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:46,584
Okay, all together now.

796
00:57:46,584 --> 00:57:50,029
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Wenger!

797
00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:52,317
Be seated.

798
00:57:54,249 --> 00:57:57,225
Our last point was "Power through Action".

799
00:57:57,528 --> 00:57:59,612
- Fuck off! We won't let you in!
- Why not?

800
00:57:59,612 --> 00:58:01,695
Because you don't belong to "The Wave".

801
00:58:04,221 --> 00:58:05,504
Leon!

802
00:58:07,845 --> 00:58:09,093
What's going on?

803
00:58:09,093 --> 00:58:11,075
They won't let me through.

804
00:58:11,075 --> 00:58:13,160
What's wrong with you,
are you crazy, or what?

805
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,245
Not without the salute.

806
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:17,342
What salute?

807
00:58:23,352 --> 00:58:26,766
Good morning, Mr Wenger.
Can I have a word?

808
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:28,852
Karo, I've missed you in class.

809
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:31,348
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure.

810
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,053
So what did you do?

811
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,120
I persuaded him my way,
what else could I do?

812
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,793
I'll have a word with your brother.

813
00:58:40,418 --> 00:58:43,628
- And what about "The Wave"?
- What about it?

814
00:58:43,628 --> 00:58:45,712
What? You will just let it go?

815
00:58:46,296 --> 00:58:48,119
You will just give it up?

816
00:58:48,119 --> 00:58:50,599
There just one day left.
We'll see it through together.

817
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,112
Without a white shirt,
for all I care.

818
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:57,873
Sorry, Rainer,
but I think it's totally out of control.

819
00:59:01,607 --> 00:59:04,309
I guess you'll have to switch classes, then.

820
00:59:19,862 --> 00:59:21,946
Everything okay?

821
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:29,726
How're things here?

822
00:59:30,983 --> 00:59:33,067
I didn't think you cared.

823
00:59:35,597 --> 00:59:38,240
Mr Wenger, can I have a word?
In my office.

824
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:40,412
Sure.

825
00:59:46,922 --> 00:59:49,919
Dr Kohlhage, believe me,
I have an educational goal.

826
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:52,502
You should see
how the students have developed.

827
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:54,952
- They are really motivated.
- I know that.

828
00:59:55,571 --> 00:59:58,799
I just wanted to tell you
Mr Westerhoff called.

829
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,383
Jens is completely changed, 
he is speaking about you in high regards.

830
01:00:02,563 --> 01:00:05,049
I didn't want to say it directly
in the teacher's room.

831
01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:09,223
You know, some of your colleagues
have a hard time with your style,

832
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:13,827
but you have my support.
Keep up the good work.

833
01:00:15,886 --> 01:00:19,873
The next edition of <i>The Scraw</i> 
is laid out. There's no room.

834
01:00:19,873 --> 01:00:21,957
It'd take too long, anyway.

835
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,747
We need to send an e-mail to all students.
Give me everyone's address. 

836
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:26,329
We can't. Privacy!

837
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:29,235
Oh, who cares? I'll help you.

838
01:00:29,455 --> 01:00:31,062
Know what I think?

839
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:33,925
I think you're going overboard.

840
01:00:34,433 --> 01:00:36,518
You wanna sit around and do nothing?

841
01:00:37,158 --> 01:00:40,275
No, I wanna go to Kaschi's LAN party.

842
01:00:40,692 --> 01:00:42,775
LAN party. Oh God!

843
01:00:43,411 --> 01:00:45,692
Don't lose them,
I had to sign for them.

844
01:00:50,512 --> 01:00:52,582
What do you say,
meet by the lake at eight? 

845
01:00:52,752 --> 01:00:56,142
Too early, say nine.
It's only project week, after all. 

846
01:00:59,257 --> 01:01:01,324
Ready to get your asses riped off?

847
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,397
- These guys?
- Yeah.

848
01:01:03,397 --> 01:01:05,482
So you're "The Wave Nazis"?

849
01:01:05,482 --> 01:01:07,986
"Wave Nazis"? 
Are you a retarded?

850
01:01:08,305 --> 01:01:10,389
- You're being brainwashed by Mr Wenger.
- Piss off! 

851
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:13,791
You painted over our graffiti.

852
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:16,218
What are you talking about, fucker!

853
01:01:23,496 --> 01:01:25,276
Tim, are you crazy?

854
01:01:25,076 --> 01:01:26,056
Tim! 

855
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,541
Tim! 

856
01:01:34,453 --> 01:01:36,537
Don't fuck around, man!

857
01:01:37,185 --> 01:01:39,828
Run or I'll blow your brains out.

858
01:01:40,557 --> 01:01:42,641
Okay, no problem.

859
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:48,001
Okay.

860
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:51,936
Tim? 

861
01:01:53,674 --> 01:01:56,033
They're gone. Put the gun away.

862
01:01:57,956 --> 01:01:59,717
Have you completely lost your mind now?! 

863
01:01:59,718 --> 01:02:01,444
How can you walk around
with that gun in your hand? 

864
01:02:01,444 --> 01:02:03,653
It only fires blanks. Calm down.

865
01:02:06,743 --> 01:02:10,064
Got it off the Internet.
Simple as that.

866
01:02:15,495 --> 01:02:16,433
<i>STOP "THE WAVE"</i> 

867
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:17,996
The end justifies the means.

868
01:02:17,996 --> 01:02:19,870
It's not true that they beat up the kid.

869
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,273
We want to stir people up, don't we?
Michael Moore does that all the time.

870
01:02:22,476 --> 01:02:24,193
I'm sticking with the truth.

871
01:02:24,193 --> 01:02:26,279
Great, then we might as well forget it.

872
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,701
Yes?

873
01:02:29,093 --> 01:02:31,175
I've been looking for you everywhere.

874
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:33,730
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

875
01:02:41,338 --> 01:02:43,421
We're having a party by the lake.
Wanna come?

876
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,544
We? You mean "The Wave" members.

877
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,317
Yes, there will be few.

878
01:02:50,317 --> 01:02:53,356
No, thanks. I won't feel welcome
without a white shirt.

879
01:02:54,261 --> 01:02:55,407
That's just stupid.

880
01:02:55,407 --> 01:02:58,043
Yes, it is stupid,
and that's why I'm not coming!

881
01:02:58,527 --> 01:03:01,233
Oh, bad vibrations! I better go.

882
01:03:01,233 --> 01:03:04,591
- You can stay.
- No, I have choir rehearsal.

883
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:06,675
Have fun at "The Wave" party.

884
01:03:06,675 --> 01:03:08,956
- Bye.
- See ya.

885
01:03:16,342 --> 01:03:19,899
- What you got against "The Wave"?
- Marco, open your eyes!

886
01:03:19,899 --> 01:03:22,030
"The Wave" it's turning 
into a really weird thing.

887
01:03:23,946 --> 01:03:25,821
You are too much involved.

888
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:27,907
Oh, really? 
Then take a look at this.

889
01:03:30,846 --> 01:03:32,931
Look at that. 

890
01:03:32,931 --> 01:03:36,658
Yeah, Tim made it.
He tends to overdo it.

891
01:03:38,325 --> 01:03:39,268
Here...

892
01:03:39,268 --> 01:03:41,850
"Yesterday, some guy wearing a white shirt 
pressed on me and said that,

893
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,630
"unless I join "The Wave",
I will loose all my friends

894
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:46,554
"because all of them would join in soon.

895
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:49,329
"I said I'll think about it
and he got nasty,

896
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:51,129
"saying it might be too late."

897
01:03:52,031 --> 01:03:53,767
Too late for what, Marco?

898
01:03:53,767 --> 01:03:56,194
Don't you understand what is going on here?
Students are being harassed.

899
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,851
That thread was posted anonymously.

900
01:04:00,525 --> 01:04:02,810
- Could be a fake.
- A fake?

901
01:04:03,551 --> 01:04:07,798
Leon hassled a six-grader
because he wouldn't do your dumb salute.

902
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:13,591
- Your brother was always a retard.
- But not only that,

903
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:16,721
I'm even treated like a leper
because I don't wear a white shirt.

904
01:04:18,126 --> 01:04:19,711
Then why not just wear one?

905
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,794
Because I don't want to.

906
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:25,434
But I do,
"The Wave" means a lot to me.

907
01:04:25,554 --> 01:04:27,036
Like what?

908
01:04:28,036 --> 01:04:30,008
Community.

909
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:34,514
You know about that,
you have a healthy family. I don't.

910
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:42,574
Are you coming?

911
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:50,701
Can I help you?

912
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:53,528
- What are you doing here?
- Protection.

913
01:04:53,528 --> 01:04:56,536
- What?
- I'm your bodyguard.

914
01:04:56,536 --> 01:04:58,622
What for? Tim, go home.

915
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:03,629
What do I want at home?
They don't care about me.

916
01:05:11,686 --> 01:05:15,590
Come to me if you have problems,
but I don't need a bodyguard, okay?

917
01:05:19,298 --> 01:05:21,382
Come with me.

918
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,143
- Hi, hon.
- Hi. 

919
01:05:35,497 --> 01:05:37,581
What did Mrs Kohlhage want?

920
01:05:40,538 --> 01:05:43,245
- Hello, Tim.
- Hello, Mrs Wenger.

921
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:45,485
- Rainer, can I have a word?
- Sure.

922
01:05:48,997 --> 01:05:50,818
What's going on?

923
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:53,619
I didn't invite him,
he just showed up.

924
01:05:54,307 --> 01:05:56,391
He's got nobody at home.

925
01:05:57,312 --> 01:05:59,261
I had other plans too.

926
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:01,372
We'll have dinner, 
I will send him home later, okay?

927
01:06:03,477 --> 01:06:08,838
Mr Wenger, do you have any ginger?
That goes really well.

928
01:07:01,956 --> 01:07:04,769
- Way cool here.
- Like I say.

929
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:09,664
- Say, what is up with Karo?
- Why?

930
01:07:09,976 --> 01:07:12,684
She came to the newspaper,
totally stressing out.

931
01:07:13,101 --> 01:07:14,143
About "The Wave"?

932
01:07:14,455 --> 01:07:17,684
She wanted the mailing list
to send out e-mails.

933
01:07:18,308 --> 01:07:21,849
- No way. Seriously?
- Yeah.

934
01:07:32,473 --> 01:07:33,931
<i>E-MAIL BEING SENT</i>

935
01:07:33,957 --> 01:07:35,506
<i>EMAIL CANCELED</i>

936
01:07:51,637 --> 01:07:52,471
- <i>NO LAN CONNECTION</i>
- Shit!

937
01:07:53,825 --> 01:07:58,615
First we thought about Paris,
and then Lake Balaton.

938
01:07:59,032 --> 01:08:02,573
But Italy would be way cooler.
Good food, beautiful women...

939
01:08:02,573 --> 01:08:03,928
What more could you want?

940
01:08:04,552 --> 01:08:07,156
Why don't you come?
As a supervisor.

941
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:09,448
We'll see, Tim.

942
01:08:09,759 --> 01:08:12,261
Tuscany. It'd be cool!

943
01:08:12,572 --> 01:08:14,446
It's not Rainer's only decision.

944
01:08:14,968 --> 01:08:17,467
I`m sure all the students 
would be for it.

945
01:08:17,467 --> 01:08:19,551
If not, we'll sign a petition.

946
01:08:22,674 --> 01:08:24,342
This has been a nice evening, Tim.

947
01:08:25,383 --> 01:08:28,507
But Anke and I would like to be alone,
we have a couple of things to discuss.

948
01:08:29,341 --> 01:08:30,383
Sure thing.

949
01:08:38,506 --> 01:08:40,381
Thanks Tim. See you tomorrow.

950
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:11,940
Heard about the "Six Wanderers"?

951
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:12,981
No.

952
01:09:13,814 --> 01:09:17,563
My dad says that here,
where the great lakes meet,

953
01:09:18,084 --> 01:09:21,210
there're still a half-dozen drowned corpses 
floating around.

954
01:09:22,355 --> 01:09:25,687
Divers see them and think they're recent,

955
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,916
until they notice 
they're wearing 1980s clothes.

956
01:09:31,103 --> 01:09:34,749
Most of them committed suicide,
and the weird thing is,

957
01:09:35,373 --> 01:09:40,060
the current keeps returning them
to the spot they died.

958
01:09:40,582 --> 01:09:43,810
As if they're looking 
for redemption or justice.

959
01:09:44,331 --> 01:09:46,518
The fishermen call them "The Six Wanderers".

960
01:09:48,496 --> 01:09:49,538
Got it.

961
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:08,494
- May I?
- Sure.

962
01:10:11,192 --> 01:10:12,466
- Okay?
- Yeah. 

963
01:10:14,264 --> 01:10:16,930
- Cheers!
- Cheers! 

964
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:30,191
Beautiful here, isn't it?

965
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,970
I never wanna leave this place.

966
01:10:36,016 --> 01:10:37,170
Who says you should leave?

967
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:42,364
Just the way it is.

968
01:10:44,028 --> 01:10:46,110
Go away to college after graduation.

969
01:10:47,051 --> 01:10:48,801
I don't even know what to study.

970
01:10:51,014 --> 01:10:55,364
I could see myself getting a regular job,

971
01:10:56,025 --> 01:10:59,858
marrying the right girl,
having two or three kids...

972
01:11:01,954 --> 01:11:05,778
and living my life in some quiet neighbourhood
for the rest of my days.

973
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:13,073
- Does that sound stupid?
- Not at all.

974
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,987
Turn down the music and come here.
You back there too. Come here. 

975
01:11:43,169 --> 01:11:44,315
Where's Marco?

976
01:11:45,565 --> 01:11:47,127
Marco!

977
01:11:48,898 --> 01:11:50,147
Get over here!

978
01:11:50,913 --> 01:11:52,098
Marco! 

979
01:11:53,593 --> 01:11:55,047
- What is it?
- Come here. 

980
01:12:01,709 --> 01:12:06,500
Good! First of all, 
it's really cool that you are all here.

981
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,645
Really great!

982
01:12:09,312 --> 01:12:16,082
And second, tomorrow is our big game
against the "bulls" from Ernst-Barlach-Gesamtschule.

983
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:17,228
You all gotta come!

984
01:12:17,643 --> 01:12:20,455
It would be really cool if all of you 
come tomorrow and support us!

985
01:12:20,455 --> 01:12:23,581
So, tomorrow, 3pm at the swimming pool!

986
01:12:23,893 --> 01:12:24,935
You guys rock.

987
01:12:25,246 --> 01:12:27,955
Bring everybody you know,
in a white shirt!

988
01:12:27,955 --> 01:12:28,683
Everybody!

989
01:12:28,892 --> 01:12:31,496
Our enemies will feel the power of "The Wave"!

990
01:12:33,059 --> 01:12:35,621
- "The Wave"!
- Now party on! 

991
01:14:32,313 --> 01:14:35,334
FRIDAY

992
01:15:02,023 --> 01:15:04,122
<i>What does this Sign means?</i>

993
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,016
Good morning, Mr Wenger.

994
01:15:17,933 --> 01:15:19,391
Tim, what`s wrong with you?

995
01:15:19,911 --> 01:15:21,369
You can't simply disappear all night.

996
01:15:21,891 --> 01:15:24,286
Do you realise the position
you're putting me in?

997
01:15:28,452 --> 01:15:29,390
Shit!

998
01:15:30,847 --> 01:15:32,410
That was those goddamn anarchists.

999
01:15:33,138 --> 01:15:35,222
Now do you believe you need protection?

1000
01:15:35,848 --> 01:15:38,347
- Hey, are you crazy?
- Yeah, calm down.

1001
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:44,387
- We got 'em all.
- Good.

1002
01:15:44,804 --> 01:15:47,721
I think we all know
who's behind this smear campaign.

1003
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:50,429
We've no proof.

1004
01:15:50,344 --> 01:15:52,099
Marco, please.

1005
01:15:56,073 --> 01:15:57,007
Marco... 

1006
01:15:58,553 --> 01:16:00,635
You also want "The Wave" 
to keep going on, right?

1007
01:16:02,094 --> 01:16:03,344
Sure. I'll talk to her...

1008
01:16:05,426 --> 01:16:06,989
but after the game, okay?

1009
01:16:08,759 --> 01:16:10,530
What should we do with all the flyers?

1010
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:12,196
Destroy them.

1011
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:20,946
What the...?

1012
01:16:25,736 --> 01:16:26,986
I don't know who did it!

1013
01:16:27,714 --> 01:16:31,360
I don't want to know,
but it was a dangerous stunt.

1014
01:16:34,693 --> 01:16:36,880
I screwed up in my days too,
believe me.

1015
01:16:39,172 --> 01:16:41,046
But this is going too far.

1016
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,379
- Got it?
- Yes, Mr Wenger.

1017
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,565
Sit down.

1018
01:16:54,482 --> 01:16:58,232
Write down your experiences with "The Wave"
over the past week,

1019
01:16:58,961 --> 01:17:01,148
and put them on my desk
at the end of class.

1020
01:17:05,106 --> 01:17:06,251
Get started.

1021
01:17:36,663 --> 01:17:37,601
Time's up.

1022
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:47,079
See you later, Mr Wenger.

1023
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:52,913
This doesn't mean I wouldn't appreciate
seeing you at the game.

1024
01:17:52,913 --> 01:17:54,578
We need your support.

1025
01:18:00,307 --> 01:18:04,265
Mr Wenger, I know who's responsible
for the graffiti on the town hall.

1026
01:18:05,098 --> 01:18:07,702
Tim, did I ask you to tell me who did it?

1027
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,785
I don't want to know.

1028
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:12,909
If I knew, I'd have to inform
the principal and the police.

1029
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:14,992
It's called vandalism.

1030
01:18:16,138 --> 01:18:19,992
If you've learnt one thing this week,
it's the value of sticking together.

1031
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:24,262
You of all people should take that to heart.

1032
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:29,366
I'll be pleased to see you
at the game today. Okay?

1033
01:18:33,843 --> 01:18:34,678
Okay.

1034
01:19:11,027 --> 01:19:11,859
Come on!

1035
01:19:12,068 --> 01:19:13,630
Yes, now play forward!

1036
01:19:14,255 --> 01:19:16,338
Marco, go forward!
What are you doing?

1037
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,858
Yes! Superb!

1038
01:19:28,108 --> 01:19:30,295
- I can't let you in.
- Why not?

1039
01:19:30,295 --> 01:19:32,065
Get yourself a white shirt,
there are still some left outside.

1040
01:19:32,273 --> 01:19:34,253
I don't want your shitty "Wave" shirt!

1041
01:19:34,565 --> 01:19:36,544
Everybody has one,
don't make a scene.

1042
01:19:36,544 --> 01:19:37,794
You're full of shit!

1043
01:19:38,835 --> 01:19:40,501
The right side is reserved for us.

1044
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:42,793
You've all gone crazy.

1045
01:19:59,041 --> 01:20:00,187
Defence, get closer!

1046
01:20:03,311 --> 01:20:04,978
Go, forward now! Forward!

1047
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:17,581
Excellent!

1048
01:20:18,517 --> 01:20:20,705
- What do you say now?
- Shut your mouth!

1049
01:20:21,006 --> 01:20:23,092
No mistakes now! 

1050
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,329
Now what?

1051
01:20:27,787 --> 01:20:29,349
I'm not giving up that easily.

1052
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,723
Fall back! You're ahead!

1053
01:20:43,154 --> 01:20:45,240
Go, Go! Faster! 
Go, Faster! 

1054
01:21:06,948 --> 01:21:08,094
Piss off, man!

1055
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,698
You bastard!

1056
01:21:26,051 --> 01:21:28,084
- Ready?
- Yeah. 

1057
01:21:31,112 --> 01:21:34,341
Stop "The Wave"!

1058
01:21:35,175 --> 01:21:37,258
Stop "The Wave"!

1059
01:21:47,298 --> 01:21:49,056
Had to be them.

1060
01:21:49,485 --> 01:21:51,059
Bring them all to me.

1061
01:21:56,592 --> 01:21:58,787
You're sick, go home! 

1062
01:21:58,952 --> 01:21:59,351
Hey, sit down! 

1063
01:22:13,672 --> 01:22:15,708
What's your problem? 

1064
01:22:17,773 --> 01:22:19,439
What's going on?

1065
01:22:31,104 --> 01:22:32,874
Are you nuts?

1066
01:22:35,374 --> 01:22:36,625
What's wrong with you?

1067
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:39,437
What are you doing?

1068
01:22:40,791 --> 01:22:42,457
Sinan, what's wrong with you?

1069
01:22:50,268 --> 01:22:52,247
Shit! I just don't believe it. 

1070
01:22:53,289 --> 01:22:55,580
You got them on this trip!

1071
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:58,080
Was it my idea for them to start a brawl?

1072
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,793
- Of course not.
- What do you mean, then?

1073
01:23:01,793 --> 01:23:05,057
You relish the way they hang on 
your every word.

1074
01:23:05,371 --> 01:23:10,370
Are you telling me you wouldn't?
You're a teacher too.

1075
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:11,724
That's not the point!

1076
01:23:12,036 --> 01:23:14,849
They look up to you,
but you're manipulating them!

1077
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:18,077
It's an ego trip.
Don't you see that?

1078
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:19,327
I think you're jealous.

1079
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:24,326
- What?
- Because they don't look up to you.

1080
01:23:24,326 --> 01:23:25,889
This minor-league teacher is showing you up.

1081
01:23:25,889 --> 01:23:28,094
You think that's the problem?

1082
01:23:28,094 --> 01:23:30,227
It's what you all think!

1083
01:23:30,227 --> 01:23:33,700
Because of my college, 
physical education and political science.

1084
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:37,450
- I never knew the wound was so deep.
- Oh, you didn't?

1085
01:23:38,282 --> 01:23:43,075
At least I don't pop pills every Monday
because I'm scared of going to school!

1086
01:23:56,551 --> 01:23:59,259
Anke... Anke, wait...

1087
01:24:01,551 --> 01:24:03,112
- I didn't mean that.
- You did.

1088
01:24:03,634 --> 01:24:04,951
You said it and you meant it.

1089
01:24:04,951 --> 01:24:07,216
You've turned into an asshole.

1090
01:24:08,216 --> 01:24:09,987
Just leave me alone!

1091
01:24:17,272 --> 01:24:18,341
Shit! 

1092
01:24:19,528 --> 01:24:25,151
Karo, what was that back there?
You can't do that! 

1093
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:26,922
You think you're some kind of resistance fighter?

1094
01:24:26,922 --> 01:24:30,255
What's up with you?
What was the deal at the game?

1095
01:24:30,568 --> 01:24:33,447
- It was full for the first time.
- And the fight?

1096
01:24:33,447 --> 01:24:35,254
That was because of this!

1097
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:36,922
You just don't get it, do you?

1098
01:24:36,922 --> 01:24:39,213
We'd have won if not for you.

1099
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:41,609
That bugs you.

1100
01:24:42,024 --> 01:24:43,900
For once it was my show today.

1101
01:24:44,732 --> 01:24:45,670
You moron.

1102
01:24:45,886 --> 01:24:47,232
- Karo!
- Leave me alone! 

1103
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,015
Don't walk away!

1104
01:25:00,251 --> 01:25:01,292
Let go of me!

1105
01:25:02,959 --> 01:25:04,209
- Let go of me!
- Karo. 

1106
01:25:07,334 --> 01:25:08,792
Get lost!

1107
01:25:52,015 --> 01:25:53,265
Marco, what are you doing here?

1108
01:25:55,869 --> 01:25:57,015
I screwed up.

1109
01:25:57,326 --> 01:25:58,368
Come on in.

1110
01:26:02,681 --> 01:26:03,722
What happened?

1111
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:09,241
I hit Karo.

1112
01:26:10,283 --> 01:26:11,325
You did what?

1113
01:26:12,575 --> 01:26:15,178
- I hit Karo.
- Why?

1114
01:26:16,782 --> 01:26:19,345
I don't know.

1115
01:26:20,491 --> 01:26:22,469
We had a fight about...

1116
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:26,636
This whole shit has totally changed me!

1117
01:26:27,052 --> 01:26:28,682
I love Karo!

1118
01:26:28,682 --> 01:26:30,973
But I still hit her.

1119
01:26:30,973 --> 01:26:35,176
All this pseudo-discipline,
it's totally fascist!

1120
01:26:36,009 --> 01:26:37,051
You have to stop it.

1121
01:26:39,029 --> 01:26:40,551
Rainer?

1122
01:26:44,029 --> 01:26:45,758
I'll think of something.

1123
01:26:46,696 --> 01:26:47,737
You have to call it off. 

1124
01:26:48,466 --> 01:26:51,174
- Now!
- Don't tell me what to do. 

1125
01:27:06,172 --> 01:27:08,671
Yes, Dr Kohlhage, I know that.

1126
01:27:09,665 --> 01:27:11,667
I know, I know, yes. 

1127
01:27:11,031 --> 01:27:12,942
I won't downplay the seriousness of it.

1128
01:27:14,192 --> 01:27:18,045
I take full responsibility,
but I must speak to the students.

1129
01:27:18,254 --> 01:27:21,067
All I'm asking is for you 
to trust me on this.

1130
01:27:36,689 --> 01:27:38,043
Hey guys, just arrived!

1131
01:27:38,459 --> 01:27:41,479
"Tomorrow, school hall, 12 o'clock.
"The Wave"'s future is at stake."

1132
01:27:41,896 --> 01:27:44,395
"Pass it on only to members and supporters."

1133
01:27:44,605 --> 01:27:45,751
Three exclamation marks?

1134
01:28:27,203 --> 01:28:28,923
SATURDAY

1135
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:48,450
Mr Wenger, it's quarter past 12.

1136
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:51,991
Lock the doors.
I don't want any interruptions.

1137
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:53,137
Yes, sir.

1138
01:28:54,179 --> 01:28:59,699
I'd like to stay standing up here,
so I have a clear view of the room.

1139
01:29:00,219 --> 01:29:01,574
Go ahead.

1140
01:29:09,385 --> 01:29:11,051
All clear here?

1141
01:29:14,384 --> 01:29:15,842
Then lock the doors.

1142
01:29:15,842 --> 01:29:18,863
Mr Wenger doesn't want any interruptions.

1143
01:29:20,216 --> 01:29:21,467
Everyone inside!

1144
01:29:50,966 --> 01:29:54,925
"I always had everything I wanted:
clothes, money, whatever,

1145
01:29:55,837 --> 01:29:57,920
"but what I had most of was boredom."

1146
01:29:58,128 --> 01:29:59,066
That's mine.

1147
01:29:59,378 --> 01:30:01,462
"The last few days have been really fun.

1148
01:30:03,024 --> 01:30:07,190
"It doesn't matter who's the best-looking,
the most popular or successful.

1149
01:30:07,919 --> 01:30:09,690
"The Wave" has made us all equal."

1150
01:30:11,502 --> 01:30:14,835
"Race, religion and class don't matter anymore.

1151
01:30:15,772 --> 01:30:17,334
"We all belong to a movement.

1152
01:30:18,064 --> 01:30:22,542
"The Wave" gives our lives meaning,
ideals worth standing up for."

1153
01:30:23,271 --> 01:30:24,729
"I used to bully other students,

1154
01:30:25,145 --> 01:30:28,062
"but the more I think about it,
the lamer it seems.

1155
01:30:28,478 --> 01:30:30,978
"It's much better to be part of a good cause."

1156
01:30:32,019 --> 01:30:35,457
"If we all rely on each other,
we can accomplish so much more,

1157
01:30:35,873 --> 01:30:38,060
"even if it means personal sacrifices."

1158
01:30:43,268 --> 01:30:44,831
As you surely noticed,

1159
01:30:45,247 --> 01:30:49,414
they were excerpts from your essays
about the past week.

1160
01:30:51,038 --> 01:30:53,226
It's impressive,
what you got out of "The Wave".

1161
01:30:53,642 --> 01:30:56,662
We shouldn't just allow our project to end.

1162
01:31:01,037 --> 01:31:03,745
- Rainer, what the hell?
- Marco, sit down!

1163
01:31:03,745 --> 01:31:05,828
Yes, but... People think...

1164
01:31:06,037 --> 01:31:07,494
I said sit down!

1165
01:31:11,139 --> 01:31:13,119
Germany's been going downhill for years.

1166
01:31:13,639 --> 01:31:15,410
We're the losers of globalisation,

1167
01:31:15,826 --> 01:31:20,201
but the politicians want us to believe
the only solution is to work harder.

1168
01:31:21,138 --> 01:31:23,534
But the politicians
are puppets for big business!

1169
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:28,429
They say unemployment's falling,
and we're still the world's export champions.

1170
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:33,844
But in reality, the poor are getting poorer
and the rich, richer!

1171
01:31:36,969 --> 01:31:39,157
Our greatest threat is terror.

1172
01:31:40,511 --> 01:31:42,698
A terror we unleashed ourselves,

1173
01:31:42,908 --> 01:31:46,345
because of the injustice we permit 
in the world!

1174
01:31:46,656 --> 01:31:49,885
And while we slowly destroy our planet,

1175
01:31:50,822 --> 01:31:53,426
a few of the superwealthy rub their hands

1176
01:31:53,946 --> 01:31:57,696
and build themselves spaceships
so they can watch from above!

1177
01:32:00,612 --> 01:32:04,570
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's manipulating you.

1178
01:32:04,778 --> 01:32:05,820
Marco, sit down!

1179
01:32:06,132 --> 01:32:08,528
You can't stop me speaking the truth, Marco.

1180
01:32:08,841 --> 01:32:10,507
"The Wave" is the real problem!

1181
01:32:12,174 --> 01:32:16,651
No. "The Wave" is the only answer.

1182
01:32:17,069 --> 01:32:18,735
Together, we can do anything.

1183
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:21,652
We...

1184
01:32:23,629 --> 01:32:27,379
We have the opportunity to make history!

1185
01:32:31,754 --> 01:32:35,504
Your girlfriend turned you up against us.
That's your problem.

1186
01:32:35,504 --> 01:32:37,379
That's not true!

1187
01:32:37,795 --> 01:32:39,982
It must be.
She infected you with her attitude.

1188
01:32:39,982 --> 01:32:41,231
But you can't stop us.

1189
01:32:41,753 --> 01:32:44,461
"The Wave" will roll over all of Germany!

1190
01:32:49,044 --> 01:32:53,209
Anyone who opposes us
will be washed over by "The Wave"!

1191
01:32:54,563 --> 01:32:55,917
Right on!

1192
01:32:58,834 --> 01:33:00,917
Bring that traitor up here!

1193
01:33:17,164 --> 01:33:19,977
Marco, I'll ask you in front of everyone.

1194
01:33:20,602 --> 01:33:23,309
Are you with us or against us?

1195
01:33:23,309 --> 01:33:25,080
Are you totally crazy?

1196
01:33:26,122 --> 01:33:27,580
What should we do with the traitor?

1197
01:33:29,455 --> 01:33:31,433
What should we do with the traitor?

1198
01:33:34,142 --> 01:33:35,288
Bomber, tell us!

1199
01:33:36,016 --> 01:33:37,474
Well?

1200
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:41,641
You helped drag him up here.

1201
01:33:43,932 --> 01:33:45,599
Because you said so.

1202
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:48,202
Because I said so?

1203
01:33:50,077 --> 01:33:52,057
Would you kill him if I said so?

1204
01:33:54,034 --> 01:33:56,951
Should we hang him or cut his head off?

1205
01:33:58,409 --> 01:34:02,680
We could torture him first,
so he agrees to our rules.

1206
01:34:04,241 --> 01:34:06,325
That's what they do in dictatorships.

1207
01:34:13,616 --> 01:34:15,281
Do you understand what happened here?

1208
01:34:17,782 --> 01:34:20,490
- You all right, Marco?
- Yeah, sure.

1209
01:34:24,864 --> 01:34:29,030
Do you remember the question
at the beginning of the week?

1210
01:34:29,863 --> 01:34:32,154
Would a dictatorship be possible again 
in Germany?

1211
01:34:34,654 --> 01:34:37,466
That's what happened here.
Fascism.

1212
01:34:40,904 --> 01:34:42,466
We thought we were special.

1213
01:34:42,986 --> 01:34:44,445
Better than the rest.

1214
01:34:45,382 --> 01:34:46,736
And what's worse...

1215
01:34:48,402 --> 01:34:51,318
we excluded others
who didn't agree with us.

1216
01:34:53,402 --> 01:34:54,652
We hurt them...

1217
01:34:57,465 --> 01:34:59,339
I don't want to think
what we might have been capable of.

1218
01:35:05,067 --> 01:35:06,629
I owe you all an apology.

1219
01:35:08,088 --> 01:35:09,129
We went too far.

1220
01:35:14,025 --> 01:35:15,274
I went too far.

1221
01:35:19,023 --> 01:35:20,378
But now it's over.

1222
01:35:21,731 --> 01:35:24,335
What's this mean?
For "The Wave"?

1223
01:35:25,272 --> 01:35:26,522
It's over.

1224
01:35:27,668 --> 01:35:28,710
Just like that?

1225
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:31,418
Yes, just like that.

1226
01:35:32,043 --> 01:35:33,501
No, it's not over.

1227
01:35:33,813 --> 01:35:35,584
Yes Tim, it's over.

1228
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,772
But not everything about "The Wave" was bad!

1229
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:40,583
We all felt it.

1230
01:35:40,896 --> 01:35:43,291
We made mistakes, but we can fix that.

1231
01:35:43,812 --> 01:35:47,250
No, Dennis.
That kind of thing can't be fixed.

1232
01:35:49,749 --> 01:35:51,311
I want you all to go home now.

1233
01:35:52,561 --> 01:35:54,852
I'm sure you have a lot to think about.

1234
01:36:13,808 --> 01:36:15,474
- Maja, I...
- Leave me alone.

1235
01:36:19,015 --> 01:36:20,057
Stop!

1236
01:36:20,786 --> 01:36:22,974
The doors stay shut!

1237
01:36:23,598 --> 01:36:24,952
Nobody goes home!

1238
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:33,805
- Put it down.
- You lied to us.

1239
01:36:36,721 --> 01:36:39,429
"The Wave" lives. It isn't dead!

1240
01:36:41,096 --> 01:36:44,430
Say it, "The Wave" lives!

1241
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:47,137
It only fires blanks.

1242
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,740
Now you take me seriously, huh?

1243
01:37:00,364 --> 01:37:02,447
I know you were fucking with me.

1244
01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:05,676
You all were!

1245
01:37:12,654 --> 01:37:13,696
"The Wave"...

1246
01:37:15,049 --> 01:37:16,404
was my life.

1247
01:37:22,757 --> 01:37:25,569
Tim, calm down.

1248
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:28,902
Calm down.

1249
01:37:29,943 --> 01:37:30,985
Put the gun down.

1250
01:37:35,047 --> 01:37:37,964
Come another step closer
and I'll shoot you in the face.

1251
01:37:39,318 --> 01:37:40,359
And then what?

1252
01:37:42,338 --> 01:37:43,379
And then what?

1253
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:47,546
There'll be no Mr Wenger,
no one to lead "The Wave".

1254
01:37:49,524 --> 01:37:51,399
Is that what you want?

1255
01:40:45,532 --> 01:40:47,628
Karo, come here.

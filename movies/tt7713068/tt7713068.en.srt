<i>They say,
if you wanna tell a story right,</i>

3
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,552
<i>you gotta start
at the beginning.</i>

4
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:40,258
<i>Too far? Fine.</i>

5
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:43,627
<i>This is me, Harleen Quinzel.</i>

6
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:44,997
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

7
00:00:45,063 --> 00:00:46,731
<i>my dad traded me
for a six-pack of beer.</i>

8
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,233
<i>But however many times
he tried to ditch me...</i>

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,500
Daddy!

10
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:51,203
- <i>...I kept coming back.</i>
- Ah!

11
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:53,305
<i>Eventually,
he found me a new home.</i>

12
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:54,872
<i>The good sisters</i>

13
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,242
<i>of St. Bernadette's
taught me a lot.</i>

14
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,114
<i>But I was never
an establishment kinda gal.</i>

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,416
<i>All things considered,
I did good.</i>

16
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:05,750
<i>I even went to college.</i>

17
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,319
<i>Got my PhD.</i>

18
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:09,553
<i>Had my heart broken
once or twice.</i>

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,722
<i>Finding love,
it's not easy.</i>

20
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:14,126
<i>So I threw myself
into my work,</i>

21
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:15,460
<i>became a psychiatrist.</i>

22
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:17,661
<i>That's when I met him.</i>

23
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,531
<i>Mr. J. My Joker.</i>

24
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:22,034
<i>Oh, I fell hard.</i>

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,635
<i>Like out of a plane
without a parachute,</i>

26
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:25,803
<i>right in
your dumb fucking face</i>

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,139
<i>kinda hard.</i>

28
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:29,474
<i>I lost all sense
of who I was.</i>

29
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,244
<i>I only had eyes for Puddin'.</i>

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,878
<i>We all know the saying,</i>

31
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:35,679
<i>"Behind every successful man</i>

32
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:37,482
<i>there's a badass broad."</i>

33
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:39,017
<i>Well, that was me.</i>

34
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:40,952
<i>I was the brains
behind some of</i>

35
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,753
- <i>Mr. J's greatest stunts.</i>
- Ha-ha!

36
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,356
<i>Not that
he let anyone know it.</i>

37
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:46,091
Puddin'?

38
00:01:46,158 --> 00:01:48,859
<i>I guess all good things
have to come to an end.</i>

39
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:51,196
<i>So...</i>

40
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,033
<i>...we broke up.</i>

41
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:59,304
<i>I handled it real mature.</i>

42
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,374
<i>But Mr. J was super
broke up about it.</i>

43
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,881
<i>I got an amazing new place
that was all mine.</i>

44
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,920
<i>It gave me the space
to really reflect</i>

45
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:17,888
<i>on the mistakes of my past.</i>

46
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:24,762
<i>I had to find
a new identity.</i>

47
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:27,765
<i>A new me.</i>

48
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:32,170
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

49
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:34,905
<i>But after a while,
I even opened myself up</i>

50
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:37,576
<i>to the possibility
of new love.</i>

51
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:41,679
Hi.

52
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:44,715
Hello, nice baby.

53
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:49,854
<i>Here's the thing
about new love...</i>

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,357
I take payment-in-kind.

55
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:55,793
<i>...you have to feed it.</i>

56
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:07,872
<i>Soon enough,
I was back on my feet.</i>

57
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,510
<i>Ready to move on,
to make new friends.</i>

58
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:14,613
<i>She means fucking business!</i>

59
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:16,181
- <i>Oh, here we go!</i>
- Whip me!

60
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:17,781
<i>She has taken
a whip from the pivot,</i>

61
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:19,717
<i>catapulted to the high side!</i>

62
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,685
<i>Oh!</i>

63
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:31,363
Yeah! Come on!

64
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:35,733
<i>It was time for Gotham
to meet the new Harley Quinn,</i>

65
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,136
<i>so I really
put myself out there.</i>

66
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:40,938
Ride that pole
like you ride your man!

67
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:49,080
God damn it.
Sit the fuck down.

68
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,415
What?

69
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:54,152
I said sit your skinny ass
down, you dumb slut.

70
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:55,886
Okay.

71
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:01,526
You broke my fucking legs!

72
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:03,128
Oh, boo-hoo.

73
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,799
What?

74
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:12,437
It's not a party without a little
drama, am I right?

75
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:14,673
Come on! Turn it up!

76
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:17,108
Shots on the house.

77
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:21,379
Call me dumb.
I have a PhD, motherfucker.

78
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:23,515
- Miss Quinn.
- Romy.

79
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:24,649
That was my driver.

80
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:26,284
Oh, whoops.

81
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,320
Well, I'm sure it was his fault.
Consider him fired.

82
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:29,454
Consider me grateful.

83
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:31,690
Especially since
I know you don't like me.

84
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:34,758
I agitate his already delicate
sense of mental equilibrium.

85
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,595
That and
his obsessive-compulsive need

86
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:37,996
to be
the center of attention.

87
00:04:38,063 --> 00:04:40,699
Will your paramour
be joining us this evening?

88
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:44,436
Not tonight, Romy.
Not tonight.

89
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:45,971
Well, enjoy yourself,
Miss Quinn.

90
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,039
And do give
the Joker my best.

91
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:49,773
<i>Okay, fine, so I hadn't</i>

92
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,908
<i>told people
about the breakup.</i>

93
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,776
<i>But you don't understand.</i>

94
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:54,346
Find me a new driver.

95
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:57,649
<i>Being Joker's girl
gave me immunity.</i>

96
00:04:57,716 --> 00:05:01,486
<i>I could do whatever I wanted
to whoever I wanted,</i>

97
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:04,356
<i>and no one
ever dared to object.</i>

98
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:19,870
And don't let him
give you shit, okay?

99
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:22,240
You have to
stick up for yourself.

100
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:43,094
Oh, please.
I give it a few days

101
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:44,596
before they're back together.

102
00:05:44,663 --> 00:05:46,031
<i>Even when I did
try and tell people,</i>

103
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,365
<i>they didn't believe me.</i>

104
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:48,967
Come on.
She told me they're really

105
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:50,302
broken up this time.

106
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:52,170
Sure they are, Shell.

107
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:54,072
That's why she's still wearing
that tacky "J" necklace.

108
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:58,109
She is going to be running
right back into his arms

109
00:05:58,176 --> 00:05:59,678
the minute
he snaps his fingers.

110
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:01,845
If not him,
the next closest alpha male

111
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:02,981
- with a pulse.
- Mmm-hmm.

112
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:05,150
Some people
just aren't born

113
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:06,551
- to stand on their own.
- Oh, girl,

114
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:07,986
- let's drink. Come on.
- All right.

115
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:09,321
<i>I knew I needed to find</i>

116
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:10,989
<i>some way
to show the world</i>

117
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:13,992
<i>that I'd cut ties
with Mr. J for good.</i>

118
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:15,260
Harley!

119
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:20,765
<i>Some people have the Eiffel
Tower, or Olive Garden.</i>

120
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:21,966
<i>The Joker and I?</i>

121
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,435
<i>Our love bloomed in</i>

122
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:26,471
<i>a highly toxic
industrial processing plant.</i>

123
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:34,045
<i>And luckily for me,</i>

124
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:36,581
<i>I have all
my best ideas drunk.</i>

125
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:40,151
I have the best idea!

126
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:51,196
The fuck? Hey! Hey!
Come back here!

127
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:03,775
This is
where it all began, Puddin'.

128
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,746
You motherfucker!

129
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:36,674
<i>It was the closure
I needed.</i>

130
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:38,076
<i>A fresh start.</i>

131
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:40,211
<i>A chance to be
my own woman.</i>

132
00:07:53,324 --> 00:07:54,925
<i>But I wasn't
the only dame in Gotham</i>

133
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:56,661
<i>looking for emancipation.</i>

134
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:00,698
<i>This is our story.</i>

135
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,335
<i>And I'm telling it,</i>

136
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,970
<i>so I'll start
where I fucking want.</i>

137
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:09,374
<i>Meet the cop.</i>

138
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,109
I got 50
says it was turf war.

139
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:12,444
<i>Not him.</i>

140
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,978
Well, as always,
you're wrong, Munroe.

141
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:16,147
<i>Her. Renee Montoya.</i>

142
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:17,682
<i>Raised on '80s cop shows,</i>

143
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:19,651
<i>she's always saying
cheesy shit like...</i>

144
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:21,386
There was only one shooter.

145
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:23,254
Inside.

146
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,557
This guy shot out the glass.

147
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:26,658
Serrano.

148
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,526
Yo. Hey.

149
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,095
Have Ballistics
check for a bullet

150
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:32,897
in one of those parked cars.

151
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:35,266
<i>Ten years ago,
she broke a career-making case.</i>

152
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,035
- Did I stutter?
- Go ahead.

153
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,838
<i>But her partner at the
time took all the credit.</i>

154
00:08:39,904 --> 00:08:41,673
<i>So while he made captain,</i>

155
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:43,541
<i>she got stuck at detective
level with this idiot.</i>

156
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,643
Okay, you think one guy
got all four?

157
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,345
Wait, wait, wait.

158
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:48,947
I'm just saying,
we got four dead bodies here, you know.

159
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:51,382
- One guy... Bullet holes.
- I'm trying to work.

160
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,185
I'm sorry. Go ahead and work.
Go ahead.

161
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,759
The shooter got close before drawing.
Six rounds.

162
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:03,661
Two for each of these three.

163
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:05,063
Yo, mind your debt.

164
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,331
I'm telling you.

165
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:07,465
That girl, Angelina,
she's a princess.

166
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:08,933
- Whoa. Hey.
- Look at this.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,502
- Is it Halloween?
- Hey. How you doing?

168
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,616
And it wasn't about them.

169
00:09:24,682 --> 00:09:28,019
It was all about this guy,
right here.

170
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:34,092
Do you know
who I am?

171
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,095
You fucking bitch.

172
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:49,040
And this arrow
through his throat...

173
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,311
She wanted him
to die slowly.

174
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:56,214
- She?
- We got a hair.

175
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:58,182
And he's got
a new assassin.

176
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:59,450
Who does?

177
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:03,421
Roman Beauvais Sionis.

178
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:06,190
Jesus Christ.

179
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:08,192
This is Montoya.
What the hell was that?

180
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:11,696
Shit.

181
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:14,699
Wow.

182
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:16,234
- Detective.
- Yep?

183
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:18,136
Found this necklace.

184
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,806
Holy shit.

185
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,576
Good work, Officer.

186
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:26,477
What is it?

187
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,748
Harley Quinn and
the Joker broke up.

188
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:31,984
What?

189
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:33,551
This was their spot.

190
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:36,554
She just publicly updated
her relationship status.

191
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:41,026
Harley Quinn just called
open season on herself.

192
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:42,660
She did not
think this one through.

193
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:45,563
<i>Yeah, no shit
I didn't think it through.</i>

194
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,832
<i>I'm about to learn
that a lot of people</i>

195
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,534
<i>in this city want me dead.</i>

196
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:53,005
<i>And at the top of
that list is this guy.</i>

197
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:58,142
Mr. Keo and his lovely
wife and daughter.

198
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:00,311
You kinda forced
my hand here.

199
00:11:00,378 --> 00:11:02,780
Gotta say,
I'm a little disappointed.

200
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:10,188
I gave you a great pitch.
Didn't I?

201
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,791
And I thought... Shh!

202
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:18,129
I thought we could build
something beautiful together.

203
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:19,999
I thought we could
be family.

204
00:11:33,678 --> 00:11:35,780
I'm gonna set you free.

205
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:38,249
Mmm...

206
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:43,788
What about her?

207
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:50,728
I think we can let her go.

208
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:53,865
I mean, this is a pretty loud
fucking shitshow of a message.

209
00:11:58,903 --> 00:12:01,239
Baby. Aww.

210
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:03,174
Don't cry.

211
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:07,945
Thank you.
Thank you.

212
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,180
You're welcome.

213
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:13,184
Is that a snot bubble?

214
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:15,553
- Ew. Gross.
- What?

215
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,222
Oh, I've changed my mind.
Peel it off.

216
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:19,891
No. No!

217
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:23,528
<i>The wack
job with the penchant</i>

218
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:26,664
<i>for peeling faces
is Roman Sionis,</i>

219
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:27,832
<i>aka</i>

220
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,701
<i>Black Mask.</i>

221
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:35,907
<i>The fact that he wants me
dead hasn't yet hit my radar.</i>

222
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:38,810
<i>See, I was halfway across town,</i>

223
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:42,413
<i>hungover,
and thinking about breakfast.</i>

224
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:49,520
<i>Egg, bacon,
American cheese.</i>

225
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:53,891
<i>Soft, toasted buttered roll.</i>

226
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,794
<i>Just a dash
of hot sauce.</i>

227
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,229
Not too much, Sal.

228
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,465
I wanna taste the cheese.

229
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,401
<i>What a way to
start my new life.</i>

230
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:08,974
<i>With the perfect
egg sandwich.</i>

231
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:10,708
Mmm!

232
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:13,811
You're a lifesaver, Sal.

233
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,784
And I'm good for the 75 cents, okay?
I promise.

234
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:22,587
That's all the money
I got in the world,

235
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:24,555
and it's so worth it.

236
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,728
<i>I don't know if it's
the stray Armenian arm hair,</i>

237
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:32,463
<i>or the fact that
his cheese slices</i>

238
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,365
<i>are always six months
out of date,</i>

239
00:13:34,432 --> 00:13:38,170
<i>but no one makes
an egg sandwich like Sal.</i>

240
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:40,404
I mean it, Sal.
No one.

241
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:57,755
Freeze! Gotham PD.

242
00:13:57,822 --> 00:14:00,993
<i>Yeah, I don't think so.</i>

243
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,460
Are you fucking kidding me?

244
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:08,466
Yo! Police.

245
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,601
<i>It had
been six short hours</i>

246
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:12,403
<i>since my little stunt
at Ace Chemicals</i>

247
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,771
<i>announced to the world</i>

248
00:14:13,838 --> 00:14:16,607
<i>that Mr. J and I
were dunzo.</i>

249
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:21,345
<i>The immunity I'd enjoyed
for so long was gone.</i>

250
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:24,216
<i>Cops who never would've
dared come after me before</i>

251
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:26,185
<i>were suddenly doing this.</i>

252
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,059
Ooh!

253
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:35,393
Freeze!

254
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,029
- <i>And what's worse?</i>
- Move!

255
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:38,863
<i>Every person I ever
wronged now felt free</i>

256
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,099
<i>to come and
take their pound of flesh.</i>

257
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,852
<i>Turns out I wronged
a lot of people.</i>

258
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:05,590
Come on, boy. Get him!

259
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:08,026
Oh...

260
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:24,042
Finally.

261
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:34,819
<i>And then...</i>

262
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:36,054
We're gonna
get through this, okay?

263
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:37,622
<i>...tragedy struck.</i>

264
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:52,037
<i>It took losing
something I truly love</i>

265
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:55,007
<i>for me to see that
the target on my back</i>

266
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:56,607
<i>was bigger
than I thought.</i>

267
00:15:58,409 --> 00:15:59,911
Freeze.

268
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:02,314
<i>With the walls
closing in around me,</i>

269
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:03,881
<i>I made a carefully calculated,</i>

270
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:06,450
<i>highly strategic move.</i>

271
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:18,297
<i>Fine. It was dumb luck.
But still...</i>

272
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:19,730
That felt pretty great.

273
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:24,702
Sorry for busting in
on you like that,

274
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:26,171
but thanks
for the shortcut.

275
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:27,672
See ya. Oh!

276
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:30,075
There she is.

277
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:31,143
Harley Quinn.

278
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:33,644
Yeah?

279
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:35,446
I've waited
a long time for this.

280
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,149
You have?

281
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,117
Oh...

282
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:41,019
I haven't had breakfast yet.

283
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,989
What did I do to you?

284
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:45,623
Are you serious?

285
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:48,193
Look at my face.

286
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:51,562
Look at my face!

287
00:16:57,535 --> 00:16:58,736
Oh...

288
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:01,639
That wasn't me.

289
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:03,641
But you dared him
to do it.

290
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,543
Yeah, but I dare
a lot of people

291
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,145
to do a lot of things, okay? Come on.
I'm not even with him anymore.

292
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:08,213
I know.

293
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:11,016
That means

294
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,118
there's no one here
to stop me.

295
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:16,254
- Right.
- You're gonna die, Quinn.

296
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:17,555
Ooh. A penny.

297
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:25,563
They're shooting arrows now?

298
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,109
Ah, crap.

299
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:38,642
Him, too?

300
00:17:48,686 --> 00:17:49,887
Parley?

301
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:56,627
Fuck, Montoya,
you smell like a dead rat's asshole.

302
00:17:56,694 --> 00:17:58,130
Not today, Simpson.

303
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:00,432
Hey, it's Detective Montoya.
Respect your elders.

304
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:02,533
I mean, your elderly.

305
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,868
You're only a few years
younger than me,

306
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:05,203
and you're still
behind that desk.

307
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,604
You wanna go there?

308
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,639
Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.

309
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:10,976
Cassandra Cain,
back already?

310
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:14,246
Thought by now you'd figure
out how not to get caught.

311
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:16,982
What? No comeback?

312
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,919
You all right?

313
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:24,855
You smell like shit.

314
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:29,693
Yo, Simpson.

315
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,030
Any clean clothes
in lost and found?

316
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:38,136
These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.

317
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:40,038
The Sionis family name
is on

318
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:41,705
half the museums and
schools in Gotham.

319
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:44,142
And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?

320
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:47,878
<i>Montoya's day is
going almost as badly as mine.</i>

321
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:50,282
<i>Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?</i>

322
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:51,582
<i>That's him.</i>

323
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:53,617
He had four people killed
alone last night.

324
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:55,420
If Roman Sionis is
such a mastermind,

325
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,688
how'd he get fired
from his own fucking company?

326
00:18:57,755 --> 00:18:58,957
The Janus Corporation is

327
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:00,724
his father's company,
thank you.

328
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,028
And by the way,
they cut him off.

329
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:05,696
Where does the DA's office
stand on all this?

330
00:19:05,763 --> 00:19:07,065
<i>To make
matters worse,</i>

331
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:08,899
<i>the assistant DA?
That's her ex.</i>

332
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:11,403
The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...

333
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,405
There's a shipment
coming in.

334
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:14,638
Drugs?

335
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:16,274
- A diamond.
- A diamond.

336
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:17,976
Wow, Montoya.
Should we call the Feds for backup?

337
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:20,312
Listen,
I had a source at the club.

338
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:21,980
His driver.

339
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:23,548
He said that Roman couldn't
stop talking about this thing.

340
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:24,782
And he said that
he overheard

341
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:25,883
something about
laser-encoding.

342
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:27,319
Now, I did some research.

343
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:30,055
I think
it's the Bertinelli diamond.

344
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:32,857
You remember the Bertinelli
massacre, right?

345
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,359
<i>Quick history lesson.</i>

346
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:36,194
<i>Fifteen years ago,
one of the wealthiest</i>

347
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:38,997
<i>Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.</i>

348
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:41,699
<i>It was a power grab,
but the real target</i>

349
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,834
<i>was the Bertinellis'
super-secret</i>

350
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:46,204
<i>offshore bank accounts,</i>

351
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:47,905
<i>the details of which
were said to be encoded</i>

352
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:51,610
<i>in the atomic structure
of a 30-carat diamond.</i>

353
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:53,311
<i>The rock was lost.</i>

354
00:19:53,378 --> 00:19:56,714
<i>And with it, the only key
to the Bertinelli fortune.</i>

355
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,716
Which is exactly
why Roman Sionis

356
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,353
is trying to
get his hands on it.

357
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:03,455
That's what makes him
so dangerous.

358
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,257
He's already
building an army.

359
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:06,358
If he gets the diamond,

360
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:07,993
he'll have all the money
and connections

361
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:10,195
to bribe every single
judge and cop

362
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:12,330
he needs to get a
monopoly on the city.

363
00:20:12,397 --> 00:20:14,366
You said you had
someone on the inside?

364
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:18,036
Yes. He's...

365
00:20:18,103 --> 00:20:19,237
He's no longer
there, but...

366
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:21,473
So basically,
you have nothing.

367
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,508
You are trying to go after

368
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:26,378
one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,

369
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:28,679
and all you've got is
rumors and a hunch?

370
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:30,315
Well, you know,

371
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:32,683
the DA's office is building
a case against him, too.

372
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,085
Isn't that right,
Miss Yee?

373
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:36,054
Listen, if the DA
is willing to throw himself

374
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:38,822
out in front of this,
it's fine with me.

375
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:39,991
Captain, no.

376
00:20:40,058 --> 00:20:41,859
Listen, Munroe, find me

377
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:44,296
some tangible connection
to Sionis, all right?

378
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:46,598
- Yes, sir.
- Wait, wait, wait. Captain.

379
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:47,932
This is my case, okay?

380
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,700
I've been working on this
for six months.

381
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:54,372
We need something that we
can actually use, Detective.

382
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,308
And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.

383
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:02,380
- Look, I'm sorry about that, but I...
- No.

384
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:04,049
That is my job
you are fucking with.

385
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:05,783
What is wrong
with you, Renee?

386
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,552
Me?
He gave my case away.

387
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,154
Oh, poor Renee.

388
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:10,589
Why don't you pour yourself a drink?
It's almost noon.

389
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:11,656
Wow.

390
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:17,395
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?

391
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:19,331
<i>Why the fuck haven't you</i>

392
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:20,632
<i>been picking up your phone?
We've got a situation.</i>

393
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,033
What... What situation?

394
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,468
<i>You didn't hear this
from me,</i>

395
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:25,570
but you gotta find her
before someone else does.

396
00:21:25,637 --> 00:21:28,073
She's got the diamond, and trust
me, Roman will kill her.

397
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:29,740
My diamond? Who?
Who's got it?

398
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:31,209
<i>This kid.</i>

399
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:34,212
She's a pickpocket.
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

400
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,214
Holy fuck.

401
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:48,193
Can I help you?

402
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,628
Why, yes.
Yes, you can.

403
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:51,795
I'm here to
report a terrible crime.

404
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:55,500
And what terrible crime
is that?

405
00:21:57,835 --> 00:21:59,137
This one.

406
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:17,756
Hi, boys.

407
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,962
Meeting's over.

408
00:23:22,754 --> 00:23:24,922
Run, piggy, run.

409
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:34,566
Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?

410
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:39,137
<i>Hold up, hold up.
I'm telling this all wrong.</i>

411
00:23:39,204 --> 00:23:40,805
<i>Let's rewind.</i>

412
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:42,474
<i>For you to understand
why me,</i>

413
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,042
<i>the cop,
and that dame on the toilet...</i>

414
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:45,477
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

415
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:48,079
<i>...are all looking for
this Cain character...</i>

416
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:50,715
<i>I gotta take you back
a few days,</i>

417
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:54,285

I'm not talking

I'm talking you and me
having each other's backs.

431
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:35,326
The Golden Lions can't just

432
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:37,562
wander into
Gotham National Bank.

433
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:39,030
I can.

434
00:24:39,097 --> 00:24:41,533
Loans, liquidity, laundering.

435
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:44,602
Look, if you bring your boys
into the fold,

436
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:48,106
there are no limits to what
we could achieve together.

437
00:24:48,173 --> 00:24:51,276
I'm building
something special.

438
00:24:51,342 --> 00:24:53,944
I appreciate your offer,
Mr. Sionis.

439
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:57,182
But with all due respect,

440
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:59,551
the Golden Lions
are a family business.

441
00:24:59,617 --> 00:25:03,121
Fuck family.
All due respect, but fuck that.

442
00:25:03,188 --> 00:25:04,556
Family's a fucking illusion.

443
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:07,025
You know what my family gave me?
Nothing.

444
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,660
I know what everyone says.

445
00:25:08,726 --> 00:25:10,361
"Here comes Roman Sionis.

446
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:12,564
He was handed life
on a silver spoon."

447
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,632
"Gin and tonics at 5:00."
"I'll have the duck."

448
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:17,869
Blah, blah, blah.
Fake fucking fucks.

449
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:21,573
But look at me now.

450
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:24,342
I've located
the Bertinelli diamond.

451
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:26,211
I'm about to own this city.

452
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,146
Not just the East End.

453
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:30,114
I am thinking big, baby.

454
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:33,184
And I want you there with me.

455
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:35,386
We could make
our own family.

456
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:36,354
Mr. Sionis,

457
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:37,889
the Golden Lions
have operated

458
00:25:37,957 --> 00:25:39,657

for nearly 100 years.

459
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:44,028
We have no need
of your protection.

<i>He's gonna
regret that.</i>

461

Will you sleep on it?
Will you do that for me?

462
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,444
Run it by that
beautiful wife of yours,

463
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:01,880

<i>Canary's been singing
at Roman's club for years.</i>

480
00:27:02,574 --> 00:27:03,808
Come on!

481
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,310
<i>He calls
her his little bird,</i>

482
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:06,844
<i>and he's got her wrapped</i>

483
00:27:06,911 --> 00:27:09,347
<i>right around
his fancy little finger.</i>

484
00:27:14,252 --> 00:27:15,587
Here you go, Canary.

485
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:16,754
Thank you.

486
00:27:18,023 --> 00:27:20,725
How do you spell "mercenary"?

487
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,127
Merceninny...

488
00:27:24,195 --> 00:27:25,396
Merceran?

489
00:27:32,136 --> 00:27:34,505
Singer lady woman!

490
00:27:34,572 --> 00:27:37,508
You're really, really good.

491
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:38,576
Yeah.

492
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:46,884
Know what a harlequin is?

493
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,823
Janky-ass clown
with bad eye makeup?

494
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:53,224
Oof!

495
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:55,259
Ouch!

496
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:01,199
A harlequin's role

497
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,335
is to serve.

498
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:06,604
An audience.

499
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:09,240
A master.

500
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:15,179
You know, a harlequin's
nothing without a master.

501
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:21,919
And no one gives two fucks
who we are beyond that.

502
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:32,697
Yeah, I don't know who
you think I am, lady,

503
00:28:32,764 --> 00:28:33,765
but I'm not her.

504
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:38,469
Puddin' and I broke up.

505
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:48,279
I haven't told that
to anyone.

506
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:51,716
Yeah.

507
00:28:51,783 --> 00:28:53,551
For good this time.

508
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:58,856
And for the first time
in a long time,

509
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:02,393
I'm all on my lonesome.

510
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:08,566
It's great.

511
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,705
Welcome to the club.

512
00:29:14,939 --> 00:29:16,541
Thanks.

513
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:20,778
Hey, don't be lonesome.
How about another drink?

514
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:22,447
- Yes!
- Yeah?

515
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,083
- Yeah.
- It's on me.

516
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:26,350
- Sure. Drinks!
- Hey, two shots.

517
00:29:29,654 --> 00:29:31,355
Hey.

518
00:29:40,565 --> 00:29:42,900
We're all good here.

519
00:29:55,847 --> 00:29:58,516
- I don't wanna go home.
- Oh, no? No.

520
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,351
No.

521
00:30:01,954 --> 00:30:04,555
Let me know
if you're gonna get sick.

522
00:30:04,622 --> 00:30:07,358
Your chariot's arrived.
Oh, there you go.

523
00:30:07,425 --> 00:30:08,659
Are we getting breakfast?

524
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:10,361
Hey, buddy,
I'm gonna need some help.

525
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:12,064
This is my friend.

526
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:13,531
I told you all about...

527
00:30:13,598 --> 00:30:14,732
Hey, get the door, man.
I got her, I got her.

528
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,768
- There we go.
- Wait.

529
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:18,936
Isn't that Joker's girl?

530
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:20,072
Not anymore.

531
00:30:20,139 --> 00:30:21,305
Got room
for one more?

532
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:22,573
Hey.

533
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:24,876
Huh?

534
00:30:27,612 --> 00:30:31,315
I don't need your help.
I got this.

535
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:33,918
You got this?
You sure about that?

536
00:30:33,986 --> 00:30:35,988
Yeah, no wonder
everyone hates you.

537
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,359
Uh...

538
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:52,537
You got this!

539
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:56,541
You motherfucker!

540
00:30:58,376 --> 00:31:00,012
Whoo!

541
00:31:03,282 --> 00:31:06,484
Well, well, well,
well, well, well.

542
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:09,687
Could that be
our little Miss Lance?

543
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:11,489
All these years,
I thought she was just

544
00:31:11,556 --> 00:31:13,992
a pretty face
and a fine set of lungs.

545
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:17,428
Ooh.

546
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:22,301
Mr. Zsasz,
I've had an amazing idea.

547
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,776
That's my little bird.

548
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:38,250
Don't touch what you can't
afford, mister.

549
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:39,517
Shut up.

550
00:31:41,286 --> 00:31:44,455
Oh, songbird.

551
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:46,624
You drive
as good as you fight?

552
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:50,728
Who's asking?

553
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:52,363
The boss.

554
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,099
You're getting promoted.

555
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:58,669
You're his new driver.

556
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:01,273
Huh. Thanks,
but I think I'm good

557
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,540
with the singing gig.

558
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:04,609
You'll be good
at the driving gig.

559
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:09,847
Be here tomorrow.
9:00 a.m. Sharp.

560
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:12,516
<i>So,
that's how Canary got herself a job</i>

561

Gotham's newest Godfather.</i>

562
00:32:15,553 --> 00:32:18,789

of yours truly.</i>

564
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:29,834
Morning.

565
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:42,847
You're
the one who wanted the kid!

566
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:44,615
I never wanted her!

567
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,786
Let me guess. Parents?

568
00:32:49,487 --> 00:32:50,788
Foster parents.

569
00:32:50,855 --> 00:32:51,856
Right.

570
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:54,759
Sorry, kid.

571
00:32:54,825 --> 00:32:57,561
Sorry about your face.

572
00:32:57,628 --> 00:33:00,065
Shit, you do have something
on your face.

573
00:33:00,132 --> 00:33:03,534
You should've seen
the other guy.

574
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:07,772
Uh...

575
00:33:07,838 --> 00:33:08,940
I want

576
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:10,808
that kid out of
my fucking house!

577
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,577
You know, kid,
not every day is gonna be like this.

578
00:33:13,644 --> 00:33:15,813
You just gotta
hang in there.

579
00:33:21,786 --> 00:33:23,554
Get something to eat.

580
00:33:25,023 --> 00:33:27,792
Stay outta that.
It's not worth it.

581
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:37,868
Don't
talk to me like that.

582
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:42,540
<i>Canary spends the next week</i>

583
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:46,044

Dinah Lance?

590
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:08,133
Who the hell are you?

591
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,802
I'm Renee Montoya,
detective with GCPD.

592
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:18,243
Your predecessor
and I had an arrangement.

593
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,744
Oh, really?

594
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,013
He told me
that there was

595
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:24,249
a shipment coming in.
A diamond.

596
00:34:24,316 --> 00:34:27,386
A very special diamond.

597
00:34:27,452 --> 00:34:30,788
Yeah, not interested, lady.
Thanks for the coffee.

598
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,993
Do you know
who you're working for?

599
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,627
You're damn right, I do.
He's the man who

600
00:34:36,694 --> 00:34:38,662
gave me a job.
Took me off the streets.

601
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:41,532
Yeah, well, he's also
a very dangerous man.

602
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,403
A criminal. A murderer.

603
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,736
What would
your mother think of

604
00:34:45,803 --> 00:34:47,872
you working for
a guy like that, huh?

605
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:50,142
You have
the same power she had.

606
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:52,010
Don't you think she
would want you to use it?

607
00:34:52,077 --> 00:34:53,944
The hell do you know
about my mother?

608
00:34:54,012 --> 00:34:57,049
Back in the day,
she used to help the GCPD.

609
00:34:57,115 --> 00:34:59,717
- She was a good woman.
- Yeah.

610
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:02,187
She was
a damn good woman.

611
00:35:02,254 --> 00:35:03,654
The kind of woman

612
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:06,124
who put everyone else's lives
before her own.

613
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,893
And when she was found
dead in the street,

614
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,031
where the fuck were you
and your boys in blue then?

615
00:35:13,098 --> 00:35:15,033
Now you wanna come
and knock on my door

616
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,002
and ask me
to help you out

617
00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:19,204
and make the same
mistake she did?

618
00:35:20,972 --> 00:35:23,874
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

619
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:27,045
That's fair enough.

620
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:29,181
And I'm sorry
for your loss.

621
00:35:30,515 --> 00:35:32,883
For the record,

622
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:36,354
that would never happen
on my watch.

623
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:41,592
The Sprang Bridge
Soldiers capituated.

624
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:44,096
"Capitulated."
Of course they did.

625
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:46,597
I told you that Keo scene
would send a message.

626
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:49,667
It sure did, boss.

627
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:51,635
It sure fucking did.

628
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:54,139
Crossbow Killer

629
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:57,342
struck again last night.

630
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:59,010
Rossi and four of his guys.

631
00:35:59,077 --> 00:36:02,013
People don't kill people I
own without my permission.

632
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,015
Why doesn't this crossbow guy
know that?

633
00:36:04,082 --> 00:36:05,716
- You know that!
- I know it.

634
00:36:05,783 --> 00:36:06,917
Why doesn't this crossbow guy?

635
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:08,819
Why don't I own
the crossbow guy?

636
00:36:08,886 --> 00:36:11,957
- You should own him.
- I mean, I like crossbows.

637
00:36:12,023 --> 00:36:14,025
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.

638
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:15,693
- Morning.
- Come in. Come in.

639
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:18,597
We're just finishing up a little business.
Look around.

640
00:36:18,662 --> 00:36:20,499
- You're late.
- It's fine.

641
00:36:20,565 --> 00:36:22,666
Should she come back another
time, 'cause she's late?

642
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:24,802
No. Isn't this stunning?

643
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:29,673
That is a Chokwe mask.

644
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,776
I got it when I was embedded
with the Mbangani tribe

645
00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:34,912
in Congo-Kinshasa.
Have you ever been?

646
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,047
- I've never been.
- Mmm.

647
00:36:36,114 --> 00:36:37,382
I've heard it's beautiful.

648
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:39,050
- It's dirty.
- Oh...

649
00:36:39,117 --> 00:36:43,255
Here, look at this.
Genuine tsantsa or shrunken head.

650
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:44,722
Shuar of Ecuador.

651
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:46,258
They're amazing people.
Surprisingly gentle.

652
00:36:46,324 --> 00:36:48,326
- I think you might like them.
- Really?

653
00:36:48,393 --> 00:36:50,728
Mmm. They boil the
heads of their enemies

654
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,663
and they make
these little fellas.

655
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,366
- Exquisite, aren't they? Look.
- Mmm-hmm.

656
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:57,801
Look at those little ears.
And his little haircut.

657
00:36:57,868 --> 00:36:59,571
- Yeah, he's 1,000 years old.
- Wow.

658
00:36:59,638 --> 00:37:01,606
And now he's just an
ornament in my living room.

659
00:37:01,672 --> 00:37:03,774
- Ew! I love it.
- Yeah?

660
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:05,443
These are
ancient acupuncture models.

661
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,180
As you can see,
they have all the acupuncture points.

662
00:37:08,246 --> 00:37:11,316
And we found these
buried in the mountains.

663
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:14,586
Ace Chemicals got blown
sky high last night.

664
00:37:14,653 --> 00:37:16,021
All right, all right,

665
00:37:16,087 --> 00:37:18,290
let's find the Crossbow Killer.
I get it.

666
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:20,192
Is he an acupuncture model,
too?

667
00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:21,926
He is not
an acupuncture model.

668
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:23,495
This is a statue of me.

669
00:37:23,562 --> 00:37:25,163
It was made by a very
famous Gotham artist...

670
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,932
Harley Quinn
did it.

671
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:30,402
Some kind of "fuck you"
to the Joker.

672
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:32,204
They split.

673
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:35,839
What's wrong with you,
Victor?

674
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:38,977
- Talk about burying the lede.
- Yeah.

675
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:42,013
This is spectacular news!

676
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,482
She doesn't belong to him,
she belongs to me.

677
00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:46,017
Have the boys
go find her.

678
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:47,918
Round her up, bring her back.
I want her.

679
00:37:47,986 --> 00:37:49,955
You, I have something
I want you to pick me up.

680
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:52,490
Something super-duper
important, okay?

681
00:37:52,557 --> 00:37:53,891
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

682
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:55,759
- Yeah, go with Victor.
- It's just a pickup.

683
00:37:55,826 --> 00:37:57,362
No, he's harmless.

684
00:37:57,429 --> 00:37:59,698
Do as you're told. Go.

685
00:38:13,811 --> 00:38:15,614
All right.
We can go.

686
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,015
I'll take that.

687
00:38:17,082 --> 00:38:18,617
Mr. S said for me
to hold on to it.

688
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:20,518
Go get your car.

689
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,191
<i>That rock.
That rock's about to become the key</i>

690
00:38:26,258 --> 00:38:27,758
<i>to whether or not
I live to</i>

691
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:30,028
<i>enjoy my newfound
independence.</i>

692
00:38:33,665 --> 00:38:34,966
Get off me.

693
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:36,468
What the hell
are you doing here?

694
00:38:36,534 --> 00:38:38,203
You're not the only one
who makes money

695
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,472
off of dumb, rich,
white people.

696
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:42,040
Well, you know what?

697
00:38:42,107 --> 00:38:43,807
One day you're gonna pick
the wrong pocket, sis.

698
00:38:43,874 --> 00:38:46,177
Okay. Whatever.

699
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:50,749
Dumb-ass kids.

700
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:54,719
Excuse me. Sorry.

701
00:39:04,828 --> 00:39:06,364
I really like your earrings.

702
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:07,931
Why, thank you.

703
00:39:09,867 --> 00:39:11,835
There's the thief.
There's the thief.

704
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,373
Get off of me!

705
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,076
That little girl
took my watch.

706
00:39:18,143 --> 00:39:20,078
I didn't do nothing.

707
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:23,782
Where the fuck's
the diamond?

708
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:25,450
I just fucking had it.

709
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:27,352
Cass!

710
00:39:29,554 --> 00:39:30,655
Wait!

711
00:39:30,722 --> 00:39:32,090
Wait, wait!

712
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:34,793
Halt!

713
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:36,894
Fuck!

714
00:39:56,281 --> 00:39:57,948
<i>In the
storytelling business,</i>

715
00:39:58,016 --> 00:40:01,186
<i>this dummy
swallowing that diamond</i>

716
00:40:01,252 --> 00:40:04,989
<i>is called a complication.</i>

717
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:08,892
<i>A complication I didn't
exactly need right now.</i>

718
00:40:11,696 --> 00:40:12,896
Parley?

719
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,169
We lost the diamond.

720
00:40:18,236 --> 00:40:19,337
What?

721
00:40:19,404 --> 00:40:21,039
We're really sorry, Mr. S.
This kid...

722
00:40:21,106 --> 00:40:23,408
We never even
got our hands on it.

723
00:40:24,743 --> 00:40:25,943
Ow!

724
00:40:26,778 --> 00:40:28,879
Help!

725
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:30,948
Get out!
Get out of here!

726
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:33,151
You, too! Go!
With your fucking sage

727
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:35,620
stinking my place up.
Fuck off!

728
00:40:35,687 --> 00:40:37,322
Here she is.

729
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:38,390
She's a child!

730
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:39,657
- Mr. Sionis.
- She's just a kid.

731
00:40:39,724 --> 00:40:41,292
She's... What?

732
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,128
We have Harley Quinn
downstairs, as requested.

733
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:44,496
Fuck off! Get out.

734
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:46,197
Fucking out!

735
00:40:46,264 --> 00:40:47,966
Fuck!
These are my things.

736
00:40:48,032 --> 00:40:49,667
- This diamond is my things.
- Yes.

737
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:51,202
My things!

738
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:53,004
Fucking fuck!
I don't ask for much, do I?

739
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:54,739
- No.
- Why is this happening to me?

740
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:56,007
Why?

741
00:40:57,509 --> 00:40:59,511
I'm gonna get
your diamond back.

742
00:41:00,612 --> 00:41:02,113
I promise.

743
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:07,218
Why don't we go downstairs
and kill that Harley bitch?

744
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:10,722
Blow off a little steam.

745
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:13,691
Yeah, I have wanted to do
that for quite some time.

746
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,329
Okay.
I'll go get changed.

747
00:41:33,645 --> 00:41:35,280
Shit, Cass.

748
00:41:40,151 --> 00:41:43,688
I don't care what it
takes, I want my diamond back.

749
00:41:43,755 --> 00:41:46,057
We're working on it.

750
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:48,960
Now, let's go have a little fun.

751
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:58,670
Harleen Quinzel.

752
00:41:58,736 --> 00:41:59,737
Whoo!

753
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:02,474
Hiya, Romy.

754
00:42:03,675 --> 00:42:06,244
Do you know why you're here?
Hmm?

755
00:42:06,311 --> 00:42:08,012
<i>When it comes to
me and Roman Sionis,</i>

756
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,882
<i>there are a lot of possible
answers to this question.</i>

757
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:12,450
<i>Breaking his driver's legs.</i>

758
00:42:12,517 --> 00:42:14,519
<i>There's that time
I called it an "expresso."</i>

759
00:42:14,586 --> 00:42:16,120
<i>Having a vagina in the first
place pisses this guy off.</i>

760
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:23,261
<i>Constantly interrupting him,
like I'm doing right now.</i>

761
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:25,563
- You're here because...
- Oh, God, stop.

762
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,899
You're gonna do that
thing where you open up

763
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,467
a weird-ass case
of torture devices

764
00:42:29,534 --> 00:42:32,036
while inexplicably
detailing your master plan

765
00:42:32,103 --> 00:42:33,371
and how
I don't fit into it.

766
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:34,806
I'm building a better...

767
00:42:34,873 --> 00:42:36,407
Seriously, you don't have to.
Really!

768
00:42:36,474 --> 00:42:37,942
You're building
a criminal empire

769
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:39,844
because Daddy kicked
you out of Janus Corp.

770
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:41,646
And you think this is a big
"fuck you," but in actuality

771
00:42:41,713 --> 00:42:43,481
it's a very misguided attempt
to win back his respect.

772
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:46,684
I get it. You're really not
as complicated as you think.

773
00:42:46,751 --> 00:42:48,753
And you're really not as
clever as you think, because

774
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,122
- now I'm gonna slice your...
- Oh, Jesus Christmas.

775
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:53,324
Now you're gonna say
that you wanna kill me

776
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:55,293
to set an example.
Christ, you're boring.

777
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,062
- I wanna kill you...
- Shit.

778
00:42:58,129 --> 00:43:00,431
...because without
the Joker around,

779
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:03,568
I can.

780
00:43:06,437 --> 00:43:09,541
For all your noise
and bluster,

781
00:43:09,607 --> 00:43:11,010
you're just
a silly little girl

782
00:43:11,075 --> 00:43:13,077
with no one around
to protect her.

783
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:19,417
- Whoa. Wait.
- What?

784
00:43:19,484 --> 00:43:21,020
- Don't kill me.
- Ha! Right.

785
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:22,787
No, no, no. Seriously. Romy, Roman.

786
00:43:22,854 --> 00:43:24,689
Come on. There's gotta be something,

787
00:43:24,756 --> 00:43:27,258
something we can figure out. Hey!

788
00:43:27,325 --> 00:43:29,527
Wait, wait!
You lost something, right?

789
00:43:29,594 --> 00:43:31,095
You lost something.
I heard you say it.

790
00:43:31,162 --> 00:43:32,363
A diamond.

791
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:39,203
Yeah.

792
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:42,540
I can help you
find it.

793
00:43:42,607 --> 00:43:45,743
Seriously.
Look in my pocket.

794
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,315
Other pocket.

795
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:01,259
I'm starting up
my own business.

796
00:44:01,326 --> 00:44:02,794
See what it says?
Second from the bottom.

797
00:44:07,198 --> 00:44:10,035
I know the East End
better than anybody.

798
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:13,271
You want this diamond back?
I'm your gal.

799
00:44:13,338 --> 00:44:15,540
Mr. J once lost
a rare photograph

800
00:44:15,607 --> 00:44:17,042
of a nude
Eleanor Roosevelt,

801
00:44:17,108 --> 00:44:19,243
and I found it in a bird's
nest in Robinson Park.

802
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:21,446
If you let me go,

803
00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:25,450
just for now,
I'll get you that rock back.

804
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:27,652
What have you got to lose?
If your boys find it first,

805
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:29,587
swear to God,
you can kill me later.

806
00:44:29,654 --> 00:44:32,256
Pinky swear.
Cross my heart, hope to fart.

807
00:44:32,323 --> 00:44:33,791
You're so tiresome!

808
00:44:35,293 --> 00:44:36,928
If you want my mercy,

809
00:44:36,996 --> 00:44:40,465
shut that hole in the middle
of your face and listen.

810
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:43,368
You're gonna
get me my diamond.

I'll give you till midnight.

827
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:39,791
And then I'm gonna peel
off that pretty face

828
00:45:39,857 --> 00:45:41,626
and pickle it.

829
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:43,561

833
00:45:56,741 --> 00:45:59,610
I won't let you down, Romy.
I promise.

834
00:45:59,677 --> 00:46:01,679
Let's make it
half a mil.

835
00:46:01,746 --> 00:46:03,881
It's more fun
if she's got competition.

836
00:46:03,948 --> 00:46:07,119
Send it to every
mercenary in Gotham.

837
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:09,454
Oh, hey, you're that
singer no one listens to.

838
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,889
Hey, you're the asshole
no one likes.

839
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,343
Jesus. Who the fuck is this?

<i>This kid,
she's got the diamond.</i>

00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:37,182
Her name's Cassandra Cain.

843
00:46:37,248 --> 00:46:38,549
Holy fuck.

844
00:46:42,154 --> 00:46:43,788
Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?

845
00:46:43,855 --> 00:46:45,890
<i>Okay.
Now we're good.</i>

846

You're a peach.

Hold up,

855
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,725
- Remember me?
- She stole my car!

856
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:56,360
- Harley Quinn.
- Hey, Quinn!

857
00:47:56,427 --> 00:47:57,996
- Let us out, see what happens.
- Don't mind me, guys.

858
00:47:58,063 --> 00:47:59,965
- You killed my chinchilla!
- Here for the kid.

859
00:48:00,032 --> 00:48:02,201
What's up, girl?
You're the reason I'm in here!

860
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:03,969
Yeah, sorry about that.

861
00:48:04,036 --> 00:48:05,436
You're dead!

862
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:06,404
I'm gonna kill
you, Quinn!

863
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,439
Hey, kid.

864
00:48:08,506 --> 00:48:09,774
You're that psycho

865
00:48:09,841 --> 00:48:11,009
- from the roller derby.
- Yeah, yeah.

866
00:48:11,076 --> 00:48:12,677
Are you Cassandra Cain?

867
00:48:12,743 --> 00:48:13,878
Yeah.

868
00:48:25,556 --> 00:48:26,959
I need to know where...

869
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:39,271
Hold, please.

870
00:48:39,338 --> 00:48:41,173
Harley...

871
00:50:01,786 --> 00:50:02,787
Hmm.

872
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:08,526
I got you,
you little shit.

873
00:50:09,995 --> 00:50:10,996
Who are you guys?

874
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:13,831
Go, go, go.

875
00:50:16,801 --> 00:50:18,203
Keep the kid alive.

876
00:51:16,861 --> 00:51:17,928
Mmm!

877
00:52:19,824 --> 00:52:21,326
A little help.

878
00:52:28,033 --> 00:52:28,967
Mmm...

879
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:41,779
Does she have
to keep running?

880
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:13,512
Roman,
you trustafarian fuckbag.

881
00:53:15,646 --> 00:53:16,914
You!

882
00:53:16,982 --> 00:53:17,882
You!

883
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:19,817
Step away
from the kid.

884
00:53:20,986 --> 00:53:21,987
Drop it.

885
00:53:22,621 --> 00:53:23,821
The phone?

886
00:53:24,456 --> 00:53:25,723
Sure.

887
00:53:39,737 --> 00:53:40,771
Mmm.

888
00:54:00,492 --> 00:54:02,427
Whoa.

889
00:54:02,494 --> 00:54:03,894
Oh, good.
You're awake.

890
00:54:03,962 --> 00:54:05,930
Toss that for me, will ya?

891
00:54:19,344 --> 00:54:21,646
What the fuck?

892
00:54:21,712 --> 00:54:23,582
Who did I just blow up?

893
00:54:23,648 --> 00:54:25,650
Either someone
who wants me dead,

894
00:54:25,716 --> 00:54:27,085
or someone looking to collect

895
00:54:27,152 --> 00:54:29,454
the half-million dollar reward
on your head.

896
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:31,389
Half a million dollars?

897
00:54:31,456 --> 00:54:32,958
Yeah.

898
00:54:33,024 --> 00:54:35,293
Do I look like I'm worth
half a million dollars?

899
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,495
- Not really.
- You've got the wrong kid.

900
00:54:37,562 --> 00:54:39,464
Now, uncuff me.

901
00:54:39,531 --> 00:54:41,199
Oh, sure.

902
00:54:41,266 --> 00:54:42,667
As soon as you
give me the diamond.

903
00:54:42,733 --> 00:54:44,436
What diamond?

904
00:54:50,808 --> 00:54:52,210
Fuck you!

905
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:55,180
Look at me.

906
00:54:58,183 --> 00:54:59,217
What?

907
00:54:59,284 --> 00:55:01,653
I don't know
nothing about no diamond.

908
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,820
The inflection
in your voice,

909
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:04,256
the way you can't
hold eye contact,

910
00:55:04,322 --> 00:55:05,590
and the fact that
you're a filthy little thief,

911
00:55:05,657 --> 00:55:07,092
all suggest that you do.

912
00:55:07,158 --> 00:55:09,628
Now, you can give it to
me, or I can give you

913
00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:11,196
to the man
that diamond belongs to.

914
00:55:11,263 --> 00:55:13,465
But trust me when I say,
you're not gonna like

915
00:55:13,531 --> 00:55:14,765
what he's gonna
do to ya.

916
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:18,703
Now, hand it over.

917
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:21,172
Yeah, not gonna happen.

918
00:55:22,641 --> 00:55:25,343
- Come again?
- I said I can't.

919
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:26,611
One more time.

920
00:55:26,678 --> 00:55:28,446
- I can't give it to you.
- Why not?

921
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:30,448
Because I ate it, okay?

922
00:55:37,656 --> 00:55:38,856
Yes.

923
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:42,093
What are we even doing here?

924
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,795
There are two ways that
diamond's coming outta ya.

925
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:47,098
This way,

926
00:55:48,533 --> 00:55:50,101
or this way.

927
00:55:52,137 --> 00:55:53,571
That's what I thought.

928
00:55:53,638 --> 00:55:55,407
Also, I'm outta groceries.

929
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:01,845
So, how long you been
a mercenary?

930
00:56:02,647 --> 00:56:04,049
Hey, where did you get...

931
00:56:04,115 --> 00:56:06,451
You're so busy
looking at my right hand,

932
00:56:06,518 --> 00:56:08,353
you haven't even
thought about my left.

933
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,821
Your left hand is
cuffed to mine.

934
00:56:15,126 --> 00:56:17,195
I'll have
to learn that one.

935
00:56:18,296 --> 00:56:19,830
Can we get this?

936
00:56:19,897 --> 00:56:22,233
You're not gonna try to
run, are you?

937
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,669
Look, if there's really
a half mil on my head,

938
00:56:24,736 --> 00:56:26,071
I figure
I'm better off with

939
00:56:26,137 --> 00:56:27,672
the person who's not
gonna cut me open.

940
00:56:27,739 --> 00:56:30,775
Fine. But if you try to
run, I will kill you.

941
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:33,178
I do not care
that you're a kid.

942
00:56:35,913 --> 00:56:38,149
I saw that.

943
00:56:38,216 --> 00:56:41,086
Seriously though,
how'd you get to be here?

944
00:56:41,152 --> 00:56:44,456
I mean,
shopping at fancy-ass stores,

945
00:56:44,522 --> 00:56:48,293
you're making bank,
you have your own business.

946
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,829
How'd you do it?
Come on, tell me.

947
00:56:50,894 --> 00:56:52,597
Woman to woman.

948
00:56:52,664 --> 00:56:56,801
Being a pickpocket's fine and
all, but I got real potential.

949
00:56:56,867 --> 00:56:58,636
I mean,
how do I be like you?

950
00:56:58,703 --> 00:57:02,974
Well, except for the crazy part.
But other than that.

951
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:06,111
Number one,
no one is like me.

952
00:57:06,177 --> 00:57:07,911
If you wanted to
even come close,

953
00:57:07,979 --> 00:57:09,280
you would have to
go to medical school.

954
00:57:09,347 --> 00:57:12,384
Become a psychiatrist,
work in an asylum.

955
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:13,884
Fall in love
with your patient,

956
00:57:13,952 --> 00:57:15,886
break said patient
out of said asylum.

957
00:57:15,954 --> 00:57:17,622
Begin a life of crime.

958
00:57:17,689 --> 00:57:19,357
Jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman.

959
00:57:19,424 --> 00:57:21,292
Get arrested
by the Batman.

960
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,027
Go back to jail,
get out of jail with a bomb on your neck.

961
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:24,729
Save the world, go back to
jail, and break out of jail

962
00:57:24,796 --> 00:57:27,098
before breaking up
with the aforementioned madman

963
00:57:27,165 --> 00:57:29,067
and going out
on your own.

964
00:57:31,736 --> 00:57:33,772
Number two...

965
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:35,407
Six bucks for tap water

966
00:57:35,473 --> 00:57:37,075
with a fucking cucumber stick
in it?

967
00:57:37,142 --> 00:57:38,309
That's crazy.

968
00:57:40,011 --> 00:57:42,213
I'm not shopping
at this store.

969
00:57:44,048 --> 00:57:45,916
I'm robbing this store.

970
00:57:45,984 --> 00:57:48,620
Consider this
your first lesson.

971
00:57:48,686 --> 00:57:50,955
Paying is for dummies.

972
00:57:57,128 --> 00:57:58,663
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

973
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:00,432
Move it!

974
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:07,372
Whoops. Ah...

975
00:58:09,507 --> 00:58:12,444
This is Doc's Place.
And this is Doc.

976
00:58:15,113 --> 00:58:16,947
Lotus flower!

977
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:19,451
- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.

978
00:58:19,517 --> 00:58:21,586
He's the Taiwanese grandpa
I never had.

979
00:58:21,653 --> 00:58:23,655
He knows everything
and everyone.

980
00:58:23,721 --> 00:58:25,423
Nothing happens around here,
let me tell you,

981
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,058
without Doc
knowing about it.

982
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:30,161
And he happens to be
the only person

983
00:58:30,228 --> 00:58:32,063
who actually cares
about me.

984
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,798
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

985
00:58:33,865 --> 00:58:35,366
She's been ordering #32

986
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:37,569
with extra chili
for many years.

987
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:38,703
Lesson number two,

988
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,638
you always want
extra chili with #32.

989
00:58:40,705 --> 00:58:42,574
So you don't
have to taste his cooking.

990
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,577
Lotus flower, you have to get
upstairs before someone sees.

991
00:58:45,643 --> 00:58:47,946
Everyone's looking for you.
And you.

992
00:58:48,012 --> 00:58:49,914
We know.

993
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:53,418
I'm telling you,
if you want boys to respect you,

994
00:58:53,485 --> 00:58:56,087
you have to show them
that you're serious.

995
00:58:56,154 --> 00:58:59,624
Blow something up.
Shoot someone.

996
00:58:59,691 --> 00:59:02,093
Nothing gets a guy's
attention like violence.

997
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,262
Shut that door.
Lock it.

998
00:59:04,329 --> 00:59:06,698
Keep your sticky paws
to yourself, okay?

999
00:59:17,509 --> 00:59:19,010
This place...

1000
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:21,045
Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.

1001
00:59:21,112 --> 00:59:23,047
...is so fucking dope.

1002
00:59:24,883 --> 00:59:27,785
Oh, shit.
Is that a hyena in a bathtub?

1003
00:59:27,852 --> 00:59:31,122
I named him Bruce after
that hunky Wayne guy.

1004
00:59:31,189 --> 00:59:33,925
He's my little dumpling,
aren't you?

1005
00:59:33,993 --> 00:59:36,127
Aren't you,
my little baby?

1006
00:59:36,194 --> 00:59:38,196
Aren't you, Brucey?
Yes.

1007
00:59:38,263 --> 00:59:40,164
I love you.

1008
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:45,103
I never said that.
I love you both equally.

1009
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:49,440
Who, that? It's Cass.

1010
00:59:52,043 --> 00:59:53,411
You're so pretty.

1011
00:59:55,246 --> 00:59:57,649
Who's this?

1012
00:59:57,715 --> 00:59:59,684
It's a beaver.

1013
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:00,752
Hmm.

1014
01:00:03,254 --> 01:00:07,525
Does Brucey want a treat?
Does Brucey want a treat?

1015
01:00:09,427 --> 01:00:10,628
What's this?

1016
01:00:14,532 --> 01:00:16,668
It's art.
Don't touch.

1017
01:00:19,571 --> 01:00:21,974
He your
ex or something?

1018
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:23,708
You don't know
who that is?

1019
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:26,311
The Joker.

1020
01:00:26,377 --> 01:00:29,147
The Clown Prince of Crime?

1021
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:30,815
My former partner
in madness?

1022
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:33,351
The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?

1023
01:00:33,418 --> 01:00:35,386
You've never heard of him?

1024
01:00:35,453 --> 01:00:37,689
Well, sounds like a dick.

1025
01:00:40,825 --> 01:00:41,826
Huh.

1026
01:00:51,903 --> 01:00:53,271
Milk.

1027
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:07,385
<i>I'm not going soft or
nothing, but I gotta admit,</i>

1028
01:01:07,452 --> 01:01:09,854
<i>it was kinda nice
having the kid around.</i>

1029
01:01:20,632 --> 01:01:23,601
Give me a #32.
Mild.

1030
01:01:23,668 --> 01:01:25,637
Uh... Yeah, sure.

1031
01:01:46,891 --> 01:01:48,127
Who are you?

1032
01:01:48,192 --> 01:01:49,594
They call me...

1033
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:53,132
H...

1034
01:01:53,197 --> 01:01:54,866
<i>My bad.
I should've introduced you.</i>

1035
01:01:54,932 --> 01:01:56,401
<i>I'll make it quick.</i>

1036
01:02:00,438 --> 01:02:02,407
<i>Meet the daughter
of the richest,</i>

1037
01:02:02,473 --> 01:02:05,810
<i>most powerful Mafia don
in Gotham City.</i>

1038
01:02:05,877 --> 01:02:08,312
<i>Helena Bertinelli.</i>

1039
01:02:08,379 --> 01:02:10,882
<i>Yep, that Bertinelli.</i>

1040
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:13,885
<i>One day,
she comes home to find</i>

1041
01:02:13,952 --> 01:02:16,587
<i>her whole family
in the living room.</i>

1042
01:02:16,654 --> 01:02:17,755
Momma.

1043
01:02:19,524 --> 01:02:23,895
<i>Anyone and everyone with
Bertinelli blood is there.</i>

1044
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:29,168
<i>Oh, and that?
That's Stefano Galante.</i>

1045
01:02:29,233 --> 01:02:30,601
<i>The guy
making the play for</i>

1046
01:02:30,668 --> 01:02:32,904
<i>the Bertinelli
turf and fortune.</i>

1047
01:02:56,661 --> 01:02:59,965
<i>When one of the goons
finds the kid alive,</i>

1048
01:03:00,032 --> 01:03:02,034
<i>the big softy
sneaks her outta there</i>

1049
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:04,535
<i>and hides her away in Sicily.</i>

1050
01:03:04,602 --> 01:03:06,804
<i>Where she is raised
by his own</i>

1051
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:10,008
<i>father and brother.
Both assassins.</i>

1052
01:03:17,348 --> 01:03:21,719
<i>She spends the next 15 years
thinking only of revenge.</i>

1053
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,322
<i>So, she starts training.</i>

1054
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:27,492
<i>When she was ready,</i>

1055
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:28,893
<i>and by "ready" I mean</i>

1056
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:30,963
<i>a badass motherfucking
killing machine,</i>

1057
01:03:34,599 --> 01:03:35,900
<i>she moves back
to Gotham.</i>

1058
01:03:35,968 --> 01:03:37,635
<i>Starts working
on that kill list.</i>

1059
01:03:46,111 --> 01:03:48,446
<i>She has the murder stuff
down, but the rest?</i>

1060
01:03:48,513 --> 01:03:49,614
Do you know who I am?

1061
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,117
Do you know who I am?

1062
01:03:52,184 --> 01:03:53,651
<i>Still a
work in progress.</i>

1063
01:03:56,255 --> 01:03:57,956
Do you know who I am?

1064
01:03:58,023 --> 01:03:59,423
The Crossbow Killer.

1065
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:00,825
They call me...

1066
01:04:00,892 --> 01:04:02,860
The Crossbow Killer.

1067
01:04:02,927 --> 01:04:04,428
They call me...

1068
01:04:04,495 --> 01:04:07,298
The Crossbow Killer?

1069
01:04:07,365 --> 01:04:08,699
They call me...

1070
01:04:11,936 --> 01:04:13,038
Huntress.

1071
01:04:13,105 --> 01:04:15,573
<i>She calls herself Huntress.</i>

1072
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,543
<i>Fucking fabulous,
if you ask me.</i>

1073
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:21,345
And who are you
looking for?

1074
01:04:27,518 --> 01:04:29,054
Great club.

1075
01:04:29,121 --> 01:04:30,688
Quinn got the girl.

1076
01:04:30,755 --> 01:04:31,756
And?

1077
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:33,992
And they disappeared.

1078
01:04:35,994 --> 01:04:37,862
Fuck!

1079
01:04:39,264 --> 01:04:40,498
Fuck!

1080
01:04:47,272 --> 01:04:48,840
What is she laughing at?

1081
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:51,943
Is she laughing at me?

1082
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:53,411
She is.

1083
01:04:53,477 --> 01:04:55,247
No, she's not.
She's...

1084
01:04:55,314 --> 01:04:57,648
What are you laughing at,
Erika?

1085
01:04:57,715 --> 01:04:59,617
Roman, you gotta
hear this.

1086
01:04:59,684 --> 01:05:02,353
- It's hilarious.
- Get on the table.

1087
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,654
- Oh.
- Ooh.

1088
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:05,890
You're being a total kook.

1089
01:05:07,226 --> 01:05:09,161
Get on the fucking table.

1090
01:05:10,761 --> 01:05:14,333
This is my club.
Get up now.

1091
01:05:14,398 --> 01:05:15,833
- Okay.
- Now.

1092
01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:19,804
Whoa.

1093
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:23,474
Now, dance.

1094
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:31,749
Dance.
Dance, Erika!

1095
01:05:31,816 --> 01:05:33,051
Okay.

1096
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:43,394
This dress
is fucking hideous.

1097
01:05:45,063 --> 01:05:46,131
Take it off.

1098
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,667
Take your dress off.

1099
01:05:51,736 --> 01:05:53,905
Get up there and
fucking cut it off her.

1100
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,209
Do it now!

1101
01:05:57,276 --> 01:05:59,510
Take her fucking dress off.

1102
01:05:59,577 --> 01:06:01,412
Just rip it off her.
Hurry up!

1103
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:02,880
Hurry up!

1104
01:06:04,649 --> 01:06:06,318
- Fucking do it.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1105
01:06:06,385 --> 01:06:07,386
Do it.

1106
01:06:10,956 --> 01:06:13,791
Yeah. Beautiful.

1107
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:31,776
You wouldn't betray me,
would you?

1108
01:06:33,979 --> 01:06:36,081
I was just
gonna go look for the girl.

1109
01:06:36,148 --> 01:06:38,417
Oh, no, no, no.
I want you to stay here with me.

1110
01:06:38,482 --> 01:06:41,686
I want you to stay here
with me close.

1111
01:06:41,752 --> 01:06:44,222
You soothe me,
little bird.

1112
01:06:58,703 --> 01:06:59,904
Oh, good.
You got it.

1113
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:01,505
Did you trace the messages?

1114
01:07:01,572 --> 01:07:03,808
You stole evidence
from an active crime scene,

1115
01:07:03,874 --> 01:07:05,243
and then had it
sent to my office.

1116
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,146
Renee, what were
you thinking?

1117
01:07:08,213 --> 01:07:11,249
Roman is the one that put
a price on the kid's head.

1118
01:07:11,316 --> 01:07:13,018
Okay? I had to.

1119
01:07:13,085 --> 01:07:14,453
I can't get into it
right now...

1120
01:07:14,518 --> 01:07:16,221
Renee, you need help.

1121
01:07:16,288 --> 01:07:18,323
What are you talking about?

1122
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:20,624
She's right.

1123
01:07:20,691 --> 01:07:24,229
You are a good cop, Montoya,
but you've lost your way.

1124
01:07:25,464 --> 01:07:26,864
What?

1125
01:07:26,931 --> 01:07:28,566
I'm sorry.
Okay?

1126
01:07:28,632 --> 01:07:30,469
You gave me no choice.

1127
01:07:30,534 --> 01:07:32,536
- Did you sell me out?
- I'm sorry.

1128
01:07:33,171 --> 01:07:34,672
You're suspended.

1129
01:07:35,673 --> 01:07:37,875
Your badge
and your gun, now.

1130
01:07:41,712 --> 01:07:45,250
<i>If you've ever
watched any cop movie ever,</i>

1131
01:07:45,317 --> 01:07:47,852
<i>you know that this is
when shit gets real.</i>

1132
01:07:47,918 --> 01:07:49,854
What's the point
of the badge,

1133
01:07:51,622 --> 01:07:53,758
when it means
fuck all anyway?

1134
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,661
Right, Captain?

1135
01:07:57,728 --> 01:07:59,563
<i>No cop
ever gets anything done</i>

1136
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:01,832
<i>until after they've
been suspended.</i>

1137
01:08:04,002 --> 01:08:05,636
<i>Which would've
had me worried,</i>

1138
01:08:05,703 --> 01:08:08,773
<i>only I had
more pressing concerns.</i>

1139
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:10,541
And that is why
you should never partake

1140
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:12,943
in paying
federal income taxes.

1141
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:14,845
Hey,
you'll ruin your nails.

1142
01:08:18,216 --> 01:08:19,484
Thank you.

1143
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,520
Anyway, lesson 37.

1144
01:08:21,585 --> 01:08:22,988
Why...

1145
01:08:24,423 --> 01:08:25,790
You said
they wouldn't find us.

1146
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:28,826
Chillax.
No one knows we're here.

1147
01:08:28,893 --> 01:08:31,729
Harleen Quinzel,
this is Gotham Police.

1148
01:08:31,796 --> 01:08:33,731
Okay.
So they know.

1149
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:35,100
Let's scram.

1150
01:08:37,536 --> 01:08:39,004
Open the door.

1151
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:41,239
Holy back door, Beavy.
This is getting outta hand.

1152
01:08:41,306 --> 01:08:42,541
Bruce, come here.

1153
01:08:42,606 --> 01:08:43,941
I can hear you!
Open the door.

1154
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:46,178
What is that?

1155
01:08:47,379 --> 01:08:49,747
See you in hell, Harley!

1156
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,985
Get under the table!

1157
01:08:56,221 --> 01:08:58,223
Bruce? Bruce!

1158
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:59,324
Come here! No!

1159
01:09:10,068 --> 01:09:11,069
Bruce?

1160
01:09:12,971 --> 01:09:15,340
Come here, boy.
Bruce?

1161
01:09:18,343 --> 01:09:19,344
Bruce?

1162
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:22,080
Bruce?

1163
01:09:23,881 --> 01:09:25,951
This doesn't make sense.

1164
01:09:26,017 --> 01:09:28,220
It doesn't make sense.
I don't understand.

1165
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:30,621
No one knew
we were here.

1166
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:32,224
No one knew we were
here, except...

1167
01:09:33,225 --> 01:09:34,292
Doc.

1168
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:35,360
Oh, my God. Doc?

1169
01:09:37,462 --> 01:09:39,663
Doc? Where is he?

1170
01:09:41,133 --> 01:09:42,267
Doc?

1171
01:09:42,334 --> 01:09:46,171
I can't find Bruce.
I can't find him. I...

1172
01:09:52,743 --> 01:09:54,513
No.

1173
01:09:54,579 --> 01:09:56,680
I'm sorry, lotus flower.

1174
01:09:56,747 --> 01:09:58,483
You sold me out?

1175
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:01,719
Too many people offering
me too much money.

1176
01:10:03,155 --> 01:10:05,890
I have enough now to
open up a new restaurant.

1177
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:08,026
A really nice one.

1178
01:10:08,093 --> 01:10:09,327
But, Doc,

1179
01:10:10,095 --> 01:10:11,896
it's me.

1180
01:10:11,963 --> 01:10:13,965
It's just business.

1181
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:44,162
<i>This next
bit ain't very pretty.</i>

1182
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:47,299
- You're right.
- Harley?

1183
01:10:47,865 --> 01:10:49,134
He's right.

1184
01:10:51,403 --> 01:10:53,004
Business is business.

1185
01:10:53,904 --> 01:10:56,374
I've got the kid.

1186
01:10:56,441 --> 01:10:57,642
But I'm gonna need to

1187
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:59,377
renegotiate
the terms of our deal.

1188
01:10:59,444 --> 01:11:01,012
If I hand her over,

1189
01:11:01,079 --> 01:11:03,548
I want everyone who's
after me to back off.

1190
01:11:03,615 --> 01:11:06,985
<i>Quinn,
bring me the rock now</i>

1191
01:11:07,052 --> 01:11:08,987
<i>and I guarantee
your safety.</i>

1192
01:11:09,054 --> 01:11:12,756
<i>I own this town.
You'll have my protection.</i>

1193
01:11:12,823 --> 01:11:14,492
Fine.

1194
01:11:14,559 --> 01:11:18,829
Meet me at Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap. In one hour.

1195
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,641
Quit judging.

1196
01:11:32,843 --> 01:11:34,045
Zsasz!

1197
01:11:40,751 --> 01:11:42,587
Come on, kid.

1198
01:11:42,654 --> 01:11:44,589
Let's get you
somewhere safe.

1199
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:45,789
We got them.

1200
01:11:49,728 --> 01:11:51,463
Little bird!

1201
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:54,898
You're gonna be
driving Mr. Zsasz tonight.

1202
01:11:54,966 --> 01:11:59,170
Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap.

1203
01:11:59,237 --> 01:12:01,573
Do we have
to bring them back?

1204
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,110
I think you can manage
a couple of little girls.

1205
01:12:06,244 --> 01:12:08,846
Just bring me back
my diamond.

1206
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,361
What is it?

1207
01:12:57,729 --> 01:12:58,929
Nothing.

1208
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:13,411
Pull over.

1209
01:13:13,478 --> 01:13:14,679
What?

1210
01:13:14,746 --> 01:13:17,415
Pull the fucking car
over now.

1211
01:13:19,751 --> 01:13:21,619
I gotta take a leak.

1212
01:13:24,622 --> 01:13:27,692
<i>She betrayed you, boss.
She betrayed you.</i>

1213
01:13:27,759 --> 01:13:29,160
Are you sure?

1214
01:13:29,227 --> 01:13:32,163
<i>Your little bird's
a fucking rat.</i>

1215
01:13:39,371 --> 01:13:41,373
<i>You want me
to kill her?</i>

1216
01:13:44,709 --> 01:13:45,777
No.

1217
01:13:45,844 --> 01:13:48,046
No. No.

1218
01:13:48,113 --> 01:13:50,048
I'll come to you.

1219
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:28,286
I thought we were friends.
And you...

1220
01:14:28,353 --> 01:14:30,021
You saw what it's
like for me out there.

1221
01:14:30,088 --> 01:14:31,756
I didn't have a choice.

1222
01:14:31,823 --> 01:14:35,059
And if you go before he gets
here, everything will be fine.

1223
01:14:36,861 --> 01:14:38,396
Harley.

1224
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:41,199
I'm sorry, kid. I am.

1225
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:52,644
That was fast.

1226
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,549
She's in...

1227
01:14:57,615 --> 01:14:59,083
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1228
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:01,619
You? Again?

1229
01:15:10,895 --> 01:15:11,963
Are you drunk?

1230
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:13,631
Come on.

1231
01:15:13,698 --> 01:15:14,699
Okay.

1232
01:15:37,088 --> 01:15:38,456
Right in the tit.

1233
01:15:44,395 --> 01:15:46,531
Where's Cassandra Cain?

1234
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:48,700
Cass.

1235
01:15:55,373 --> 01:15:58,142
You killed my sandwich!

1236
01:16:05,216 --> 01:16:06,618
Bye-bye, birdie.

1237
01:16:08,086 --> 01:16:09,287
Ow!

1238
01:16:11,022 --> 01:16:12,757
No fair.

1239
01:16:12,824 --> 01:16:14,492
Was that really necessary?

1240
01:16:14,559 --> 01:16:16,494
You don't know her
like I do.

1241
01:16:17,061 --> 01:16:18,263
Cass?

1242
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:23,635
Oh, thank God.

1243
01:16:24,569 --> 01:16:25,904
I'm gonna get you
outta here.

1244
01:16:25,971 --> 01:16:27,272
Did she really tape you

1245
01:16:27,338 --> 01:16:29,140
- to a damn toilet?
- Mmm-hmm.

1246
01:16:30,808 --> 01:16:31,876
Hmm.

1247
01:16:31,943 --> 01:16:33,511
This is nice.

1248
01:16:34,345 --> 01:16:36,180
You're still conscious.

1249
01:16:38,283 --> 01:16:39,617
You can still feel?

1250
01:16:39,684 --> 01:16:42,787
Look at me.
Are you a good girl, now?

1251
01:16:44,389 --> 01:16:48,693
"I'm a good girl.
I'm a good girl."

1252
01:16:59,837 --> 01:17:01,205
I got one

1253
01:17:02,041 --> 01:17:03,374
for all the little birds

1254
01:17:03,441 --> 01:17:07,211
I helped fly away
from this world.

1255
01:17:07,278 --> 01:17:10,114
I'm saving
a special spot for you.

1256
01:17:11,316 --> 01:17:12,784
Right here.

1257
01:17:17,922 --> 01:17:18,923
You're gonna
have to be quiet.

1258
01:17:18,991 --> 01:17:20,158
- Ow!
- Hi.

1259
01:17:20,224 --> 01:17:21,693
What are you guys doing?

1260
01:17:25,663 --> 01:17:28,600
Oh, I know
where the diamond is.

1261
01:17:28,666 --> 01:17:31,836
Is that rock
still inside you?

1262
01:17:34,872 --> 01:17:36,474
Oh, God.

1263
01:17:39,577 --> 01:17:40,612
Stop.

1264
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,248
The hell, Zsasz?

1265
01:17:45,017 --> 01:17:46,184
Cut her open.

1266
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:47,685
Stop fucking around.

1267
01:17:47,752 --> 01:17:49,120
You heard me.

1268
01:17:49,187 --> 01:17:51,489
Cut her fucking open.

1269
01:17:51,556 --> 01:17:54,559
Okay. No, no. No, no, no.
See, she's just a kid.

1270
01:17:54,626 --> 01:17:56,996
You're a filthy
fucking rat.

1271
01:17:57,062 --> 01:17:58,596
I'm a rat?

1272
01:17:58,663 --> 01:18:02,233
I knew you couldn't be trusted.
Roman's little bird.

1273
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,702
You little fucking bird.

1274
01:18:04,769 --> 01:18:07,438
That's why he needs me
to look out for him.

1275
01:18:09,273 --> 01:18:12,410
That's why he needs me
to take care of him.

1276
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:17,049
You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.

1277
01:18:17,116 --> 01:18:18,349
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

1278
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:19,717
Prove it to me.

1279
01:18:20,986 --> 01:18:23,287
Rip open
her little tummy.

1280
01:18:23,354 --> 01:18:24,856
Yeah,
that's not gonna happen.

1281
01:18:24,922 --> 01:18:27,258
Now! Rip it open!

1282
01:18:40,905 --> 01:18:42,874
You piece of shit!

1283
01:18:51,182 --> 01:18:52,383
Freeze!

1284
01:18:56,254 --> 01:18:57,689
Don't fucking move.

1285
01:19:00,092 --> 01:19:01,726
Who the fuck are you?

1286
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:09,968
Go get the kid.

1287
01:19:10,035 --> 01:19:11,536
All right.

1288
01:19:11,602 --> 01:19:13,371
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Back the fuck up!

1289
01:19:13,438 --> 01:19:16,041
- Get away from me. All of you.
- Put that shit down.

1290
01:19:16,108 --> 01:19:18,143
Shoot them, kid.

1291
01:19:18,209 --> 01:19:22,081
You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!

1292
01:19:22,147 --> 01:19:25,216
- Cass, it's okay. Just calm...
- Don't move!

1293
01:19:25,283 --> 01:19:26,952
Okay.

1294
01:19:27,019 --> 01:19:29,320
I don't know what
the fuck is going on.

1295
01:19:29,387 --> 01:19:30,922
But I know
that this shit stick...

1296
01:19:32,557 --> 01:19:34,559
...just tried to gut me.

1297
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,561
And you.

1298
01:19:38,663 --> 01:19:40,465
Thought you were different.

1299
01:19:43,234 --> 01:19:44,635
I'm sorry, kid.

1300
01:19:46,972 --> 01:19:49,741
I'm just a terrible person,
I guess.

1301
01:19:56,714 --> 01:19:57,715
Ooh!

1302
01:19:58,449 --> 01:19:59,784
Ooh, I'm back.

1303
01:19:59,851 --> 01:20:01,753
Okay, I feel like
I've just walked in on

1304
01:20:01,819 --> 01:20:03,321
something I don't
give two shits about.

1305
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:04,555
This guy's dead,
so I'm just

1306
01:20:04,622 --> 01:20:06,058
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?

1307
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:08,726
No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.

1308
01:20:08,793 --> 01:20:10,928
Excuse me?
I work for Sionis?

1309
01:20:12,497 --> 01:20:15,234
I'm not letting you
sell the kid to him.

1310
01:20:15,299 --> 01:20:16,667
I wasn't going
to sell the kid.

1311
01:20:16,734 --> 01:20:18,369
I was going
to trade the kid.

1312
01:20:18,436 --> 01:20:20,239
Yeah. To save your own stupid skin.
Huh?

1313
01:20:20,304 --> 01:20:21,472
I'm not proud
of what I did,

1314
01:20:21,539 --> 01:20:23,307
but I had
half the city after me.

1315
01:20:23,374 --> 01:20:25,276
Even the fucking
Crossbow Killer.

1316
01:20:25,343 --> 01:20:27,079
I'm not
the Crossbow Killer!

1317
01:20:27,146 --> 01:20:28,346
Whoa.

1318
01:20:30,082 --> 01:20:31,183
They call me...

1319
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,817
Helena Bertinelli.

1320
01:20:32,884 --> 01:20:33,751
For fuck's sake.

1321
01:20:33,818 --> 01:20:35,887
As in
the Bertinelli massacre?

1322
01:20:35,954 --> 01:20:39,958
Sheesh kebab.
That is childhood trauma, right there.

1323
01:20:45,663 --> 01:20:47,732
<i>I killed Galante.</i>

1324
01:20:51,502 --> 01:20:53,172
I killed his firing squad.

1325
01:20:58,143 --> 01:21:00,745
<i>I killed Victor Zsasz.</i>

1326
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:07,953
And now I'm done.

1327
01:21:09,787 --> 01:21:10,888
Bravo.

1328
01:21:15,927 --> 01:21:17,695
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.

1329
01:21:17,762 --> 01:21:20,098
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

1330
01:21:20,165 --> 01:21:21,599
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

1331
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:24,002
sweetheart,
but you are not done.

1332
01:21:24,069 --> 01:21:25,137
Who do you think funded

1333
01:21:25,204 --> 01:21:26,771
Galante's little
power grab, huh?

1334
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:28,606
Galante was
working with Sionis.

1335
01:21:28,673 --> 01:21:30,976
Roman killed your whole
family looking for that rock.

1336
01:21:31,043 --> 01:21:33,911
You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?

1337
01:21:33,979 --> 01:21:36,614
That diamond is our only
chance of stopping him.

1338
01:21:36,681 --> 01:21:37,849
You guys.

1339
01:21:37,915 --> 01:21:40,484
Hey, I think
you should see this.

1340
01:21:42,988 --> 01:21:44,022
Oh.

1341
01:21:44,089 --> 01:21:45,756
It's Sionis.

1342
01:21:58,103 --> 01:22:00,305
We're fucked.

1343
01:22:00,371 --> 01:22:02,440
He bought himself an army.

1344
01:22:11,116 --> 01:22:12,117
They're all here for me.

1345
01:22:14,286 --> 01:22:15,820
Aren't they?

1346
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,229
- No.
- They're not?

1347
01:22:24,296 --> 01:22:26,497
No, they're not.

1348
01:22:26,564 --> 01:22:28,100
Do you know
what that means?

1349
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:29,700
That means he's not just
after the kid anymore.

1350
01:22:29,767 --> 01:22:31,203
He's after all of us.

1351
01:22:31,270 --> 01:22:34,106
He's sure as hell after me.
I just robbed him.

1352
01:22:34,172 --> 01:22:37,408
You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.

1353
01:22:37,475 --> 01:22:38,843
And you're dumb enough

1354
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:40,945
to be building
a case against him.

1355
01:22:41,013 --> 01:22:43,748
So, unless we all wanna
die very unpleasant deaths

1356
01:22:43,814 --> 01:22:45,516
and let Roman
go finger-fishing

1357
01:22:45,583 --> 01:22:47,185
in the kid's intestinal tract,

1358
01:22:48,686 --> 01:22:50,122
we're gonna have
to work together.

1359
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:52,757
With you?

1360
01:22:52,823 --> 01:22:54,059
Yeah.

1361
01:22:54,126 --> 01:22:55,626
We're gonna work together,

1362
01:22:55,693 --> 01:22:57,162
and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?

1363
01:23:01,366 --> 01:23:02,667
Okay.

1364
01:23:03,601 --> 01:23:06,038
Yeah. Okay.

1365
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:10,075
Sure.

1366
01:23:10,142 --> 01:23:11,509
Yes!

1367
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:13,878
But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.

1368
01:23:13,945 --> 01:23:14,946
Mmm-hmm.

1369
01:23:18,683 --> 01:23:21,485
Will this do?

1370
01:23:22,955 --> 01:23:23,921
No.

1371
01:23:23,989 --> 01:23:25,790
Not at all.

1372
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,694
We're dead.
We're fucking dead.

1373
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,030
That slimy jizznozzle!
I can't believe

1374
01:23:32,097 --> 01:23:33,966
- he took it all!
- We're fucked.

1375
01:23:34,032 --> 01:23:36,567
- Fuck!
- Uh, there's this.

1376
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:43,976
Okay.

1377
01:23:55,354 --> 01:24:00,125
Friends,
brothers, men of Gotham.

1378
01:24:01,193 --> 01:24:05,863
I have funded you.
I've protected you.

1379
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:09,900
I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.

1380
01:24:09,968 --> 01:24:12,703
Well, now it's time
to say thank you.

1381
01:24:13,938 --> 01:24:16,008
Go show those little bitches

1382
01:24:16,074 --> 01:24:19,877
you don't mess
with Roman Sionis.

1383
01:24:19,944 --> 01:24:23,482
Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.

1384
01:24:23,547 --> 01:24:25,783
The rest you can kill.

1385
01:24:31,889 --> 01:24:32,890
Dope.

1386
01:24:34,692 --> 01:24:36,328
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that one.

1387
01:24:36,395 --> 01:24:38,596
Sentimental value.
Try this.

1388
01:24:40,664 --> 01:24:42,034
You're kidding.

1389
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,801
What?
Gotta take care of the girls.

1390
01:24:43,868 --> 01:24:45,636
Isn't this fun?
It's just like a sleepover.

1391
01:24:45,703 --> 01:24:47,973
We should order pizza.
Make cosmos.

1392
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,142
- Harley, focus. Yeah.
- Okay.

1393
01:24:51,443 --> 01:24:52,810
Hey, nice.
What the hell is up

1394
01:24:52,877 --> 01:24:54,079
with this bow
and arrow shtick?

1395
01:24:54,146 --> 01:24:55,613
It's not a fucking
bow and arrow.

1396
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:57,149
It's a crossbow.
I'm not 12.

1397
01:24:57,215 --> 01:24:58,949
I love this chick.
She's got rage issues.

1398
01:24:59,017 --> 01:25:00,684
I don't have rage issues.

1399
01:25:00,751 --> 01:25:03,355
You know,
psychologically speaking,

1400
01:25:03,422 --> 01:25:06,191
vengeance rarely brings
the catharsis we hope for.

1401
01:25:06,258 --> 01:25:07,526
Yeah.

1402
01:25:07,591 --> 01:25:10,062
Are we ready?
Bad guys, just outside.

1403
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:15,666
Shit. Get down.

1404
01:25:17,469 --> 01:25:18,803
Down here!

1405
01:25:20,505 --> 01:25:21,772
Cass!

1406
01:25:21,839 --> 01:25:23,841
- Follow me!
- Go, go, go, go!

1407
01:25:23,908 --> 01:25:25,377
Go!

1408
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:31,249
Holy shit!

1409
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:53,572
What?

1410
01:25:53,637 --> 01:25:55,706
You are so cool.

1411
01:25:55,773 --> 01:25:57,409
Okay. This way.

1412
01:26:06,218 --> 01:26:07,586
Get ready, ladies.

1413
01:26:18,296 --> 01:26:19,564
Don't worry.
You're gonna make it.

1414
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:21,099
Okay? Okay.

1415
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:23,901
What the...
Go! Go, go, go!

1416
01:26:24,603 --> 01:26:25,803
Fuck.

1417
01:26:27,938 --> 01:26:29,141
Shit.

1418
01:26:39,117 --> 01:26:40,385
Whoa. Shit!

1419
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:01,139
Motherfucker.

1420
01:27:14,452 --> 01:27:16,488
Let me go!

1421
01:27:16,555 --> 01:27:18,156
Gotcha.

1422
01:27:19,324 --> 01:27:20,358
This way!

1423
01:27:20,425 --> 01:27:21,960
Come on. Come on.
It's okay. Come on.

1424
01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:24,029
You shouldn't
have to see this.

1425
01:27:24,095 --> 01:27:25,863
Here, hold on to this
for me, okay?

1426
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:27,232
That's all you think about.

1427
01:27:27,299 --> 01:27:28,600
Just close your eyes
and hold it tight. Okay?

1428
01:27:30,168 --> 01:27:32,137
Here. Get down. Come on.
You'll be safe.

1429
01:28:14,312 --> 01:28:15,313
Canary!

1430
01:28:16,814 --> 01:28:18,717
You okay?

1431
01:28:18,782 --> 01:28:20,385
We gotta go this way!

1432
01:28:22,721 --> 01:28:24,289
Ugh. More?

1433
01:28:24,356 --> 01:28:26,291
When the fuck did she have
time to do a shoe change?

1434
01:28:26,358 --> 01:28:27,492
Come on.

1435
01:28:34,532 --> 01:28:35,533
Thanks.

1436
01:28:49,014 --> 01:28:50,215
Duck!

1437
01:28:54,519 --> 01:28:55,853
- Hair tie?
- Yeah.

1438
01:28:56,755 --> 01:28:57,821
Ah, fuck!

1439
01:29:02,926 --> 01:29:04,195
I got him!

1440
01:29:07,666 --> 01:29:08,967
Get back here, kid!

1441
01:29:12,771 --> 01:29:14,172
Who's got the kid?

1442
01:29:26,817 --> 01:29:28,019
Get down!

1443
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:41,132
Please, no more.

1444
01:29:45,804 --> 01:29:47,238
So, forgive me yet?

1445
01:29:47,305 --> 01:29:48,373
Get off me.

1446
01:29:53,078 --> 01:29:55,380
Anyone else hungry?
I know a great taco spot.

1447
01:29:55,447 --> 01:29:56,781
- I'm starving.
- I love tacos.

1448
01:29:56,847 --> 01:29:58,149
Really?

1449
01:30:06,358 --> 01:30:08,093
Down! Get down!

1450
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:09,728
You're okay.
You're okay.

1451
01:30:09,794 --> 01:30:12,397
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Let me check it.

1452
01:30:14,865 --> 01:30:16,101
Get off!

1453
01:30:16,167 --> 01:30:17,535
I got you.

1454
01:30:17,602 --> 01:30:19,237
Ooh!

1455
01:30:19,304 --> 01:30:21,806
Aren't you glad you wore that?
Sexy and bulletproof.

1456
01:30:21,872 --> 01:30:24,776
Harley! No!
Get off me!

1457
01:30:24,843 --> 01:30:25,909
Harley!

1458
01:30:25,977 --> 01:30:27,545
They got the kid.
Shit!

1459
01:30:27,612 --> 01:30:32,050
We can't let them get her.
I trust you.

1460
01:30:32,117 --> 01:30:33,952
- One bullet?
- Please help me!

1461
01:30:34,018 --> 01:30:35,520
Has anyone
got any bullets?

1462
01:30:35,587 --> 01:30:37,756
Fuck. I'm out.

1463
01:30:37,822 --> 01:30:40,959
I can't get out there.
I just need to get through.

1464
01:30:41,025 --> 01:30:42,926
- We gotta go. We gotta move.
- Shit.

1465
01:30:42,994 --> 01:30:44,662
Guys, they're in the car.

1466
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:46,631
They're getting away.

1467
01:30:46,698 --> 01:30:48,233
- Get in there!
- Get off!

1468
01:30:50,668 --> 01:30:52,570
Shit! I'm out.

1469
01:30:52,637 --> 01:30:54,339
Guys, come on.
They're closing in.

1470
01:30:55,874 --> 01:30:59,144
Canary, you know
what you have to do!

1471
01:30:59,210 --> 01:31:02,147
Cover your ears!
You better get her back.

1472
01:31:22,167 --> 01:31:24,469
<i>Told ya she had
a killer voice.</i>

1473
01:31:45,824 --> 01:31:47,025
Need a ride?

1474
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:14,052
Get her!

1475
01:32:44,984 --> 01:32:46,784
Oh!

1476
01:32:57,562 --> 01:32:58,663
Whip me!

1477
01:32:58,730 --> 01:32:59,764
What?

1478
01:32:59,831 --> 01:33:01,199
- Whip me!
- Okay.

1479
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,241
Kid!

1480
01:33:10,808 --> 01:33:11,809
Harley!

1481
01:33:12,944 --> 01:33:14,145
Shoot her!

1482
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:23,888
Harley!

1483
01:33:23,956 --> 01:33:25,456
Hit the brakes!

1484
01:33:45,109 --> 01:33:46,477
No!

1485
01:33:59,857 --> 01:34:00,858
Uh-oh.

1486
01:34:27,885 --> 01:34:29,187
Kid!

1487
01:34:41,132 --> 01:34:42,567
Harley!

1488
01:35:00,351 --> 01:35:01,919
Well,
we always did share

1489
01:35:01,987 --> 01:35:03,321
a love of the dramatic.

1490
01:35:03,388 --> 01:35:04,589
Didn't we?

1491
01:35:06,924 --> 01:35:08,593
And look at us now.

1492
01:35:09,927 --> 01:35:12,530
But don't you see?
You're trying to kill me.

1493
01:35:12,597 --> 01:35:15,233
I'm the only one
who can protect you!

1494
01:35:17,835 --> 01:35:20,304
You know you can't
stand on your own, Quinn.

1495
01:35:20,371 --> 01:35:21,739
You're not the type!

1496
01:35:23,075 --> 01:35:26,310
But me?
You need me!

1497
01:35:40,558 --> 01:35:43,661
Here's the thing,
Romy baby.

1498
01:35:45,563 --> 01:35:47,699
Your protection is
based on the fact

1499
01:35:47,765 --> 01:35:50,002
that people
are scared of you.

1500
01:35:50,069 --> 01:35:51,970
Just like
they're scared of Mr. J.

1501
01:35:57,442 --> 01:36:00,211
But I'm the one
they should be scared of.

1502
01:36:00,278 --> 01:36:02,714
Not you, and not Mr. J.

1503
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:06,185
'Cause
I'm Harley fucking Quinn.

1504
01:36:13,524 --> 01:36:14,792
Shit.

1505
01:36:16,327 --> 01:36:18,097
That was super embarrassing.

1506
01:36:18,163 --> 01:36:19,731
Hmm. Sure was.

1507
01:36:19,797 --> 01:36:23,601
You think you can beat me?
You're a fucking moron.

1508
01:36:25,137 --> 01:36:27,338
I'm sorry, kid.

1509
01:36:27,405 --> 01:36:29,074
And I'm sorry
I tried to sell you.

1510
01:36:29,141 --> 01:36:30,842
That was a dick move.

1511
01:36:32,443 --> 01:36:35,080
For what it's worth,

1512
01:36:35,147 --> 01:36:38,783
you made me want to be
a less terrible person.

1513
01:36:39,917 --> 01:36:41,319
Ew.

1514
01:36:41,385 --> 01:36:44,388
If we're apologizing for shit,
I should tell you something.

1515
01:36:44,455 --> 01:36:45,757
Excuse me!

1516
01:36:45,823 --> 01:36:48,359
I stole something from you.

1517
01:36:48,426 --> 01:36:50,428
You slippery-fingered
little turd.

1518
01:36:50,495 --> 01:36:52,097
I took your ring.

1519
01:36:52,164 --> 01:36:53,498
My ring?

1520
01:36:56,168 --> 01:36:57,368
Dope.

1521
01:37:17,321 --> 01:37:19,224
Cass! Harley!

1522
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:20,725
We're okay.

1523
01:37:24,362 --> 01:37:25,897
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1524
01:37:26,697 --> 01:37:28,599
- He's gone?
- Mmm-hmm.

1525
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:30,802
Good. Fuck that guy.

1526
01:37:30,868 --> 01:37:32,637
Yeah. Tacos?

1527
01:37:33,805 --> 01:37:35,207
No, but seriously.

1528
01:37:35,274 --> 01:37:37,142
You were very impressive
with that bow.

1529
01:37:37,209 --> 01:37:38,342
Very impressive.

1530
01:37:38,409 --> 01:37:39,644
It's a crossbow.

1531
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:41,013
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

1532
01:37:41,079 --> 01:37:42,513
- Mmm-hmm.
- Morning margaritas!

1533
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:43,714
Thank you. I got you.

1534
01:37:43,781 --> 01:37:44,916
- You drink, right, kid?
- Yeah.

1535
01:37:44,983 --> 01:37:46,484
I don't think so.

1536
01:37:46,551 --> 01:37:48,586
And I love that fucking
name, Huntress.

1537
01:37:48,653 --> 01:37:50,189
- Really?
- Yeah.

1538
01:37:50,255 --> 01:37:51,722
Oh, great name.

1539
01:37:51,789 --> 01:37:52,824
Wow.

1540
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:55,493
Um... I really like
how you were able

1541
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,662
to kick so high
in those tight pants.

1542
01:37:57,728 --> 01:37:59,264
- Yeah, that is cool.
- Yeah.

1543
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:01,099
- Thanks.
- Oh, um...

1544
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:03,601
Thanks for the car.

1545
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:06,637
You're welcome.

1546
01:38:06,704 --> 01:38:08,639
Kid, if that burrito
doesn't make you shit,

1547
01:38:08,706 --> 01:38:10,741
I don't know what will.

1548
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:13,544
Give me a minute.

1549
01:38:15,314 --> 01:38:16,514
Yes!

1550
01:38:16,581 --> 01:38:19,084
Right.

1551
01:38:20,585 --> 01:38:22,054
I've given her prune
juice, laxatives.

1552
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,422
I mean, the kid's got
a stomach made of steel.

1553
01:38:24,488 --> 01:38:26,757
And you know what?
I owe you an apology.

1554
01:38:27,358 --> 01:38:28,961
Me?

1555
01:38:29,027 --> 01:38:32,563
I underestimated you.
And I'm sorry.

1556
01:38:33,898 --> 01:38:35,900
I'm used to it.

1557
01:38:35,968 --> 01:38:39,370
Uh, Harley!
Bring the colander.

1558
01:38:40,973 --> 01:38:42,074
Ladies.

1559
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:43,808
Have fun with that.

1560
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:47,678
So, what now?

1561
01:38:47,745 --> 01:38:49,047
Sionis is gone,
but it's just

1562
01:38:49,114 --> 01:38:51,216
a matter of time
before some other asshole

1563
01:38:51,283 --> 01:38:52,683
tries to finish
what he started.

1564
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:53,851
Right.

1565
01:38:53,918 --> 01:38:57,289
We gotta clean this city
from the inside out.

1566
01:38:57,356 --> 01:38:59,690
Does she always talk like
the cop in a bad '80s movie,

1567
01:38:59,757 --> 01:39:01,193
or is that just me?

1568
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:02,361
Fuck you.
And fuck you.

1569
01:39:02,426 --> 01:39:03,761
What?

1570
01:39:03,828 --> 01:39:05,964
I mean,
we were amazing there.

1571
01:39:06,031 --> 01:39:07,332
Yeah! Hell yeah!

1572
01:39:07,398 --> 01:39:10,868
I agree completely.
So I'll do that, as well.

1573
01:39:10,935 --> 01:39:11,836
Thank you.

1574
01:39:11,903 --> 01:39:13,105
Right.

1575
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:14,172
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

1576
01:39:17,042 --> 01:39:18,176
She stole my fucking car!

1577
01:39:18,243 --> 01:39:19,311
What?

1578
01:39:23,382 --> 01:39:24,749
I'm sorry.

1579
01:39:24,815 --> 01:39:26,385
<i>I know
what you're thinking.</i>

1580
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:28,353
You think I'm a dick
after all that.

1581
01:39:28,419 --> 01:39:32,057
But you heard what the cop said.
Sionis is gone.

1582
01:39:32,124 --> 01:39:37,895
And those guys?
They're gonna be just fine.

1583
01:39:37,963 --> 01:39:39,430
<i>Montoya's boss picked up</i>

1584
01:39:39,497 --> 01:39:41,266
<i>the gangbangers
at the Booby Trap.</i>

1585
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:44,735
<i>And took all the credit
while he was at it.</i>

1586
01:39:44,802 --> 01:39:45,836
<i>Again.</i>

1587
01:39:51,343 --> 01:39:53,045
<i>It was the kick in
the balls she needed</i>

1588
01:39:53,111 --> 01:39:54,946
<i>to see that she had
nothing to prove</i>

1589
01:39:55,013 --> 01:39:57,581
<i>to those blowhard assholes.</i>

1590
01:39:57,648 --> 01:40:00,218
<i>She quit the same day.</i>

1591
01:40:04,488 --> 01:40:06,824
<i>We got the secret bank codes
off the diamond.</i>

1592
01:40:06,891 --> 01:40:09,493
<i>And Huntress
got her family money back.</i>

1593
01:40:10,628 --> 01:40:11,829
<i>She's using it to fund</i>

1594
01:40:11,896 --> 01:40:13,631
<i>a little
crime-fighting outfit.</i>

1595

<i>They call themselves
the Birds of Prey.</i>

1596
01:40:20,705 --> 01:40:23,674
<i>I call them
dorky little do-gooders.</i>

1597
01:40:26,044 --> 01:40:29,181
<i>The rock itself was worth
a chunk of change,</i>

1598
01:40:29,247 --> 01:40:30,681
<i>so I pawned it.</i>

1599
01:40:30,748 --> 01:40:32,516
<i>And I invested the cash
in a little startup</i>

1600
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:34,186
<i>making waves
in the East End.</i>

1601
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:40,025
<i>Oh! And I found Bruce.</i>

1602
01:40:40,092 --> 01:40:42,593
<i>He was wandering
around Chinatown.</i>

1603
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:44,062
<i>I guess it proves the theory</i>

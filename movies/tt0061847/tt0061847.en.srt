SAMURAI REBELLION

21
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:42,174
Do you want to try, Tatewaki?

22
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:48,009
Isaburo Sasahara
of the escort group has tested it.

23
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:49,782
That's enough for me.

24
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:52,114
I see.

25
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:57,756
I'll tell the chamberlain
you both approve.

26
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:03,965
I'd rather see you two duel
than merely test swords.

27
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,569
There are rumors in our clan.

28
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,110
The reason you don't fight

29
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,042
is because it would hurt
the family of the loser.

30
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:20,350
You both understand that,
and so you avoid a duel.

31
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:23,214
Be that as it may.

32
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,158
Perhaps protecting your family name

33
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:30,260
rather than promoting
your pride and rank

34
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:32,661
is the wisest way
to get along in this world.

35
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:44,733
Slicing straw dummies
to test our lord's sword.

36
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,879
What peaceful times these are.

37
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:50,741
Now, now.
Think of it as one of our duties.

38
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:56,419
Isaburo, you're too attentive
to your superiors.

39
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:59,616
I'm used to it.

40
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:05,291
I married into my wife's family
and have been henpecked for 20 years.

41
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,939
Did anything unusual happen?

42
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:19,773
No, nothing at all.

43
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,308
Would you like to look
at the November border record?

44
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:28,683
No, not if nothing unusual happened.

45
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:33,453
I'm returning to the castle
with Sasahara.

46
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:41,125
Making rice cakes in November

47
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:47,532
But there are no customers

48
00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:52,974
They're waiting anxiously
for the Inoko festival.

49
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,542
Inoko?

50
00:05:56,515 --> 00:06:00,815
Does that mean the Suwa Shrine
festival begins tomorrow too?

51
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:06,752
The god who came down in February
and brought the rice harvest

52
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:10,556
departs tomorrow
until his return next year.

53
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,792
Do you really believe that?

54
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:16,731
No, I was just -

55
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,267
The hearts of children
are docile and precious.

56
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,304
They sing, believing it.

57
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:28,006
Perhaps you want a grandchild?

58
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:34,245
Yes, as soon as I find
a bride for Yogoro.

59
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,446
It isn't settled yet?

60
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:40,924
No. My wife Suga is the problem.

61
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,394
It must be someone she approves of.

62
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:48,363
I keep quiet,

63
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:51,498
but I'd like a nice wife for Yogoro.

64
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:54,697
Someone strong, loving and faithful.

65
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,820
Is that the steward's?

66
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:21,996
Yes, he just arrived.
He's been waiting for you.

67
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:30,840
Making the steward wait.

68
00:07:30,943 --> 00:07:34,504
You were probably
idly chatting away to Asano

69
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:37,912
about useless things
like martial arts again.

70
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:42,514
To have the steward honor us
with a visit

71
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:46,352
has never happened
in the Sasahara family.

72
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:49,053
The truth is, Isaburo,

73
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,688
Lady Ichi has been
dismissed from the castle.

74
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,497
Lady Ichi?

75
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,968
Yes.

76
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:01,706
It has been decided

77
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:05,743
to have her marry Yogoro,
your son.

78
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:11,540
Steward, why was Lady Ichi dismissed?

79
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:15,618
She incurred our lord's displeasure.

80
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:20,516
But he's reluctant
to give her to any man.

81
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,595
You're one of
our lord's cavalry escorts,

82
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:28,759
and given that your son
is a fine man, he chose him.

83
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:36,973
I'll return for an answer in a few days.

84
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:39,636
But Sasahara,

85
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:45,445
it is our lord's decision,
so bear that in mind.

86
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:55,458
The steward is leaving!

87
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:09,604
Why should we accept Lady Ichi?

88
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:13,910
You should have refused at once.

89
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:17,675
What was it, of all that happened,

90
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:22,743
that led our lord to dismiss her?

91
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:27,826
In the first place, she -

92
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:30,088
I know.

93
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:32,987
The daughter
of the keeper of the records -

94
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:36,034
Everyone knows that.

95
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:42,138
The reason she was dismissed after
bearing our lord's son, Kikuchiyo -

96
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:44,471
That's what I want to know.

97
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,704
- Mother, that's -
- You be quiet.

98
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,580
Three men gather in a room
and still have no idea what's going on.

99
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:57,155
How embarrassing.

100
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:00,890
It's like this.

101
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:06,588
After Lady Ichi bore her son Kikuchiyo,

102
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,891
she went to a spa to rest.

103
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:17,943
When she returned,
she saw Lady Tama with our lord.

104
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:22,814
The daughter of Gohei Yamagiwa,
the man in charge of the castle wardrobe,

105
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,678
was serving beside him.

106
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:29,187
Lady Ichi lost her head on seeing this.

107
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,651
She sprang at Lady Tama,

108
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:36,887
slapped her face,
and dragged her by the hair.

109
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:41,865
Then she seized our lord
by his garments

110
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:46,061
and slapped him repeatedly.

111
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:51,440
A vain, wild woman
who would attack our lord -

112
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:53,273
How can we accept her?

113
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:58,083
But, Mother...

114
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:03,878
I think we should gratefully
accept her without being difficult.

115
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:05,547
Bunzo!

116
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:10,688
No matter what you say,
we must accept her.

117
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,456
It's an order from our lord.

118
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:37,880
I'm afraid...

119
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:42,550
I don't feel very enthusiastic about it.

120
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,561
Neither do I.

121
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:50,428
But if I refuse,
there may be trouble later.

122
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,298
Yogoro has said nothing,

123
00:11:54,406 --> 00:12:00,242
but he wouldn't be happy marrying
a lord's mistress who has borne a child.

124
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:07,584
Marrying unwillingly
and under pressure.

125
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,852
Different circumstances, but much like
my own marriage into the Sasahara family.

126
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:20,899
I don't want him
to repeat my mistake.

127
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,590
Sasahara!

128
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:27,939
Isaburo,
I didn't find you at your office.

129
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,406
They said you'd be at the border.

130
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:32,870
I'm glad I found you.

131
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:36,642
I heard everything.

132
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:41,181
The steward and chamberlain
are good judges.

133
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,888
Alert even in times of peace.

134
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:50,295
It's an honor that a member
of our group has been chosen.

135
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:54,524
But, Isaburo...

136
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:59,529
as for the marriage and other matters,

137
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:03,335
I suggest you keep things quiet.

138
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:08,704
You'll probably receive a larger fief.

139
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:14,544
So be modest about it or the others
will think you're showing off.

140
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,744
Understand?

141
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,382
Anyway, I congratulate you.

142
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:23,423
A happy event.

143
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:31,602
What nerve.

144
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:37,368
He's not thinking of you
or your family.

145
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,241
Only outward appearance
and influence matter with him.

146
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:51,614
Will you draw on your secret principles
of swordplay?

147
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:56,722
Push and you step back.

148
00:13:57,596 --> 00:13:59,928
Push further,
and you step back further.

149
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:03,093
But at the last moment,

150
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:07,195
you skillfully switch
from defense to offense.

151
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:10,431
Yet you never attack.

152
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,043
You wait until your opponent tires.

153
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,913
In other words, until he gives up.

154
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,614
Unworthy?

155
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,788
Yes.

156
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:33,991
We cannot accept
our lord's favored lady.

157
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,567
There's no need to be so reserved.

158
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,266
It's happened before,

159
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:43,836
not just in the Aizu clan,
but in every clan.

160
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:47,605
I'm well aware of that,

161
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,105
but even so, I wish to decline the honor.

162
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:51,580
Decline?

163
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:57,379
Sasahara, that will not be allowed.

164
00:14:57,756 --> 00:15:00,190
It is our lord's personal wish.
You'd -

165
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:03,318
I mean no disrespect.

166
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:07,092
We are not worthy of such an honor.

167
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,599
You know our lord's wish.

168
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:11,497
It's an order!

169
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:16,870
I would never disobey him,
but if I may decline...

170
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:21,173
What?
To decline is to defy the order!

171
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,111
No, I'd never do that.

172
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:27,208
It's just that
we're unworthy of the honor.

173
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:28,786
Sasahara.

174
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,047
You refuse to agree to it?

175
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:36,821
It's not about
agreeing or disagreeing.

176
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:39,454
We are unworthy of the honor.

177
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,465
What? You continue saying that?

178
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,435
Father,

179
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:54,203
I wish to accept the honor.

180
00:15:54,313 --> 00:15:55,280
What?

181
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:11,695
Young men seem to be
more understanding.

182
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:17,167
I don't know what use it is
to think only of martial arts.

183
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:22,033
Isaburo Sasahara,
you seem a bit too stubborn.

184
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:40,454
May you enjoy long life together

185
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:50,166
We'll all be at your side
as long as you live

186
00:16:53,005 --> 00:17:00,173
This is a day of celebration

187
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:09,310
Let our spirits
celebrate this happiness

188
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:50,884
I am not very competent,

189
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:55,660
but I hope you will be good to me.

190
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:00,470
You may have been
our lord's lady once,

191
00:18:01,273 --> 00:18:06,301
but you have now married
into the Sasahara family.

192
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:09,312
Keep that in mind.

193
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,575
Suga, you needn't -

194
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:16,347
No. I must say it in order
to keep discipline in our home.

195
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:22,490
A woman who was dismissed
after bearing a child.

196
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:26,163
Pampering her would spoil her.

197
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:57,756
Welcome back.

198
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:59,989
I'm sorry I didn't notice your return.

199
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,656
It's all right.

200
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,925
Where's Nui?

201
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:08,200
Mother took her along
for prayer at Shonenji Temple.

202
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:14,508
Where's Father?

203
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,980
He came home about an hour ago,
when his duties were done.

204
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:23,381
Ichi.

205
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:28,750
Mother may say things to offend you,
but don't mind her.

206
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,761
No, she doesn't offend me.

207
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,763
She kindly teaches me
domestic duties.

208
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,102
I don't believe it.

209
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:43,797
If things grow disagreeable
and hard to bear,

210
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,468
think of Father.

211
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:48,702
Father?

212
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:51,915
Father finds

213
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:57,845
the way Mother thinks and talks
disagreeable.

214
00:19:57,956 --> 00:20:00,015
But despite that,

215
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:04,553
he has borne everything for 20 years.

216
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,605
Ichi, is dinner ready?

217
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:25,580
Yes, right away.

218
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:30,751
A bottle of sake tonight as well.

219
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:34,255
While the cat's away.

220
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,020
You mustn't.

221
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:41,657
If she'd just change a little,
all would be well.

222
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:45,665
The world never seems to go right.

223
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:56,509
"I wish to retire

224
00:20:56,615 --> 00:21:01,575
and have Yogoro,
my eldest son, succeed me.

225
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:07,056
I humbly hope that
my request will be granted."

226
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:11,827
Sasahara,

227
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:15,360
how are your son and his bride doing?

228
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:20,397
Very well, I'm happy to say.

229
00:21:22,274 --> 00:21:26,210
You made such a fuss about this
in the beginning,

230
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:29,480
but now it's all going very well?

231
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:32,277
I'm very sorry.

232
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:36,146
It's too early to retire, I think,

233
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:39,985
but his son has married, so -

234
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:41,725
All right.

235
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,988
We'll ask the steward
to enquire of our lord.

236
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:48,696
It won't take long
to obtain his approval.

237
00:21:56,374 --> 00:22:01,073
So Isaburo Sasahara's retiring at last?

238
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:05,011
I didn't realize it at the time,

239
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:09,212
but it's a great relief.

240
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,924
At the same time,
it's a Ionely feeling.

241
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:18,020
I wonder what I've done all my life,

242
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,964
though it's not like me to do so.

243
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:31,669
Yogoro's marriage is
a very happy one.

244
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:37,472
Perhaps life will be a little better
for our children.

245
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,482
At least Yogoro's better off than me.

246
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:46,421
Fear often exceeds the perceived danger.
So it was in your case.

247
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,260
Yogoro's wife.

248
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,028
She's a fine wife.

249
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:59,469
I thought she'd be like a cannon,
ready to go off at any time.

250
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:01,863
But I was very wrong.

251
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:05,604
Suga's just the same as before,

252
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:10,142
but Ichi is always pleasant
and never talks back.

253
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:12,708
I don't understand.

254
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,016
Why did she attack our lord then?

255
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:25,060
Like yourself,
I don't understand it either.

256
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:35,464
As I've said,
your duties won't be difficult.

257
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:39,343
Check the weapons in the armory
against the inventory list,

258
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:44,381
and have the men clean them
on appointed days.

259
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,280
That's about all.

260
00:23:48,486 --> 00:23:54,425
It's harder to get along
with our superiors and fellow vassals.

261
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:01,499
I don't say to always yield to them,
but at times, they're unreasonable.

262
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,569
If you get angry at them every time,
you won't last.

263
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:08,665
Pardon me.

264
00:24:20,618 --> 00:24:22,108
Rice cakes?

265
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:23,886
They look good.

266
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:26,116
Yes. Enjoy.

267
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:27,948
Wait, Ichi.

268
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,394
I'm going to retire soon.

269
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:37,190
Yogoro will become
the head of our family,

270
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:39,099
and you're his wife.

271
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:44,439
You needn't hold back
for the old woman.

272
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:48,839
Take over the household duties.
Understand?

273
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:53,710
Even so, she is my mother,

274
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,277
and I will treat her as such.

275
00:24:58,823 --> 00:25:00,848
Excuse me.

276
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,965
That's enough
about your duties, Yogoro.

277
00:25:14,672 --> 00:25:16,799
How about some rice cakes?

278
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:23,545
But I don't understand.

279
00:25:25,517 --> 00:25:26,848
Well...

280
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,613
it's almost beyond belief

281
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:33,714
that she'd grasp her lord
by his clothing.

282
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:38,428
It was hard for me to believe too,

283
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,127
so I asked her the other day.

284
00:25:46,738 --> 00:25:50,299
Her face became very sad

285
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:53,071
as she told me the story.

286
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:05,888
I was 19
when I went to serve my lord.

287
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:10,259
It was the year before last.

288
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:31,981
Ichi.

289
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:34,451
Actually,

290
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:40,086
there is a reason the steward
has come to see me.

291
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:44,760
You have found favor
in our lord's eyes

292
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,831
and are to serve him.

293
00:26:48,266 --> 00:26:52,134
Accept the honor gratefully.

294
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:07,379
The sudden news
must have surprised you.

295
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:11,822
I was more angry than surprised.

296
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,822
Angry?

297
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:19,088
A man over 50 was infatuated with me.

298
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:23,892
I felt as if a hairy worm
were crawling over me.

299
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:26,101
I shuddered.

300
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:28,867
And then?

301
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:34,036
Our lord does not do this
just to satisfy a whim.

302
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:36,911
Daimyo must have heirs

303
00:27:37,015 --> 00:27:40,917
or their houses will be abolished.

304
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,118
The only heir to our lord right now

305
00:27:46,224 --> 00:27:48,454
is young Lord Masamoto.

306
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:52,087
Should anything happen...

307
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:55,565
Even so, Miss Ichi,

308
00:27:56,568 --> 00:28:00,334
not just anyone
can become our lord's mistress,

309
00:28:01,272 --> 00:28:03,399
for her son may one day

310
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:07,775
become our lord's heir.

311
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:12,213
She must be
beautiful and kind like you.

312
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:14,678
I am afraid

313
00:28:15,587 --> 00:28:17,384
I must decline the position.

314
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:23,427
You are referring
to Sannojo Kasai, your fiancי?

315
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:25,822
Kasai?

316
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:28,723
Yes.

317
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:34,135
Our parents arranged our engagement.

318
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:38,039
Then if Sannojo agrees,

319
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:44,181
you will gratefully agree
to serve our lord?

320
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,146
What do you say?

321
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:56,257
I couldn't imagine Sannojo doing it.

322
00:28:56,694 --> 00:29:02,599
But he bowed to our lord's wishes

323
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,968
and gave you up?

324
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:06,036
Yes.

325
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:09,004
So you had no choice?

326
00:29:10,642 --> 00:29:13,304
I still did not wish to go.

327
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:16,942
So I withheld my answer.

328
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:19,040
Don't bother me!

329
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:20,509
Leave now!

330
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:22,246
No.

331
00:29:22,487 --> 00:29:26,150
I will not leave until I see Sannojo.

332
00:29:26,691 --> 00:29:32,630
You said you would serve our lord
if Sannojo agreed.

333
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:40,531
He has clearly agreed to it.

334
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,695
As summoned,

335
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:11,869
Hyoemon Shiomi's daughter Ichi
is here in answer to your wishes.

336
00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:33,457
It was like dragging
a pure silk kimono through the mud.

337
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:38,829
Then I thought -

338
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:45,235
No, it was more like a prayer.
I made up my mind.

339
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,967
I would bear him sons.

340
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:55,108
Many, many sons.

341
00:30:56,748 --> 00:31:01,776
Then other girls need never know
my misery. It would end with me.

342
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:06,349
It was like a prayer.

343
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,824
My thoughts were really
like a prayer.

344
00:31:17,235 --> 00:31:19,260
With this prayer,

345
00:31:20,738 --> 00:31:23,798
I bore Kikuchiyo a year later.

346
00:31:26,611 --> 00:31:31,310
Then I went to a spa
for postnatal rest

347
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:34,510
at my lord's orders.

348
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,312
When I returned to the castle -

349
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:51,096
Ichi, this is Lady Tama.

350
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,962
Be friends with her.

351
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:09,312
It wasn't jealousy!

352
00:32:11,155 --> 00:32:13,715
On the face of his new young mistress,

353
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:17,556
there was not even
a trace of humility.

354
00:32:17,662 --> 00:32:19,254
I hated her for it.

355
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:25,065
She was proud as a peacock -
glad to be a mistress.

356
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:11,976
Beast!

357
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:13,740
Beast!

358
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:33,594
Thanks to his
displeasure toward you,

359
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,198
I have become a happy man.

360
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:40,771
I could never have found
a better wife.

361
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:05,097
Beginning tonight,

362
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,465
I will forget my son.

363
00:34:09,106 --> 00:34:10,266
What?

364
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:13,671
Our lord means nothing to me.

365
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:16,610
But...

366
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:21,742
I have been so worried
about the son I bore.

367
00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:25,084
So worried.

368
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:33,062
Beginning now...

369
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:38,333
I will forget about him too.

370
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:46,603
I will forget him.

371
00:34:58,456 --> 00:34:59,684
Yogoro,

372
00:35:00,524 --> 00:35:02,651
be good to Ichi.

373
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:05,718
You're a lucky man.

374
00:35:06,297 --> 00:35:09,858
There's no other wife like her.

375
00:35:38,947 --> 00:35:42,508
A couple without children
lacks binding ties.

376
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:47,547
You've made me wait nearly two years,

377
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:49,590
but at last.

378
00:35:49,758 --> 00:35:53,216
A boy would have been better.

379
00:35:53,328 --> 00:35:57,526
We mustn't ask for too much.

380
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:02,999
And what's her name?

381
00:36:05,774 --> 00:36:10,404
Yogoro and I racked
our poor brains over this

382
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:12,739
and named her Tomi.

383
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:31,589
Post-horse messenger!

384
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:40,467
Ryuzo Komiya here from Edo
on an urgent mission!

385
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:50,983
What?

386
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,847
Young Lord Masamoto died of illness?

387
00:36:53,956 --> 00:36:56,424
Yes!

388
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,293
He was resting from a cold
he caught on the 12th.

389
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:07,792
But his condition grew worse.

390
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:10,697
At 2:00 in the morning,

391
00:37:11,406 --> 00:37:12,771
he passed away.

392
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:23,508
It's a lucky thing.

393
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,018
What?

394
00:37:25,854 --> 00:37:27,822
It's the death of the heir.

395
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,418
But the Matsudaira house
will not be abolished.

396
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:38,567
There is young Lord Kikuchiyo,
the son of Shiomi's daughter.

397
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:06,487
But Sasahara,

398
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:10,661
Lord Kikuchiyo has become
our lord's heir.

399
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:14,494
So Ichi is birth mother to the heir.

400
00:38:16,371 --> 00:38:22,207
If she remains the wife of a vassal,

401
00:38:22,377 --> 00:38:25,175
there would be much talk.

402
00:38:27,149 --> 00:38:31,017
You say this is our lord's wish?

403
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,609
Yes.

404
00:38:32,921 --> 00:38:38,382
And our chamberlain here
and the Edo chamberlain agree.

405
00:38:41,263 --> 00:38:46,758
Please consider it
before formal orders come.

406
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:53,740
The best thing is for Yogoro
to submit a request to our lord

407
00:38:54,643 --> 00:38:57,077
and say he will send Ichi
back to the castle.

408
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:06,686
Has Yogoro been told already?

409
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:14,694
I've been at him
since the day before yesterday,

410
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,893
but he refuses.

411
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,224
Naturally.

412
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:23,168
They have a baby daughter, Tomi.

413
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:26,674
Well, I don't blame him.

414
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:30,205
Emotionally it is intolerable.

415
00:39:32,848 --> 00:39:36,045
The chamberlain
and steward know that.

416
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:41,286
But you know very well...

417
00:39:42,624 --> 00:39:45,593
that we can't have all our wishes
granted in this world.

418
00:39:47,195 --> 00:39:48,355
So...

419
00:39:48,964 --> 00:39:53,128
you're telling me
to make Yogoro agree to it?

420
00:39:53,802 --> 00:39:56,066
I'm asking you
to submit a voluntary request

421
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:59,106
rather than making us
order her back.

422
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:02,774
You must see the difference.

423
00:40:28,837 --> 00:40:31,567
What's the matter, Ichi?

424
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,969
You're pale. Are you sick?

425
00:40:34,943 --> 00:40:40,381
Group Head Kotani
came over in the afternoon.

426
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:46,115
I feel...

427
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:50,817
more resentful than grateful...

428
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:55,522
for your consideration.

429
00:41:03,138 --> 00:41:04,696
I'm sorry, Ichi.

430
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:08,975
I didn't mean to hide it.

431
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:12,711
But I couldn't bring myself
to tell you.

432
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:15,277
Brother.

433
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:18,076
Father is calling you.

434
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:22,651
What are the men talking about?

435
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:27,826
I'm not sure.

436
00:41:27,929 --> 00:41:30,989
Acting as if
some crisis has occurred

437
00:41:31,299 --> 00:41:33,859
and hiding it from me.

438
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:39,464
Tell them to talk at night
after they dine!

439
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:59,220
Ichi, I must tell you something.

440
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:01,627
Come into the room.

441
00:42:23,118 --> 00:42:26,451
First, Father's words.

442
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:33,990
He says he's retired,
so I am the family head,

443
00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:38,693
and I am to do
what I think is right.

444
00:42:40,735 --> 00:42:44,296
However, he also says

445
00:42:44,873 --> 00:42:48,502
you're too important to us
to send away.

446
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:53,910
That we must take
the best possible care of you.

447
00:43:01,656 --> 00:43:07,356
Mother doesn't seem to know
anything about this yet.

448
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:12,991
I must tell her sooner or later.

449
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,501
Don't worry.

450
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:22,673
No matter what anyone says,

451
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:26,475
I will not send you
back to the castle.

452
00:43:30,018 --> 00:43:31,713
For Tomi's sake too.

453
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,820
It may be our lord's wish,
but he is being too selfish.

454
00:43:43,565 --> 00:43:47,001
Ichi is not a doll.
She is a living being.

455
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:49,093
Yes, you're right.

456
00:43:49,604 --> 00:43:52,198
You're young.
And I don't blame you.

457
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:56,833
But you can't reason with a crying child
nor with your lord, as they say.

458
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,840
Isaburo, what's your opinion?

459
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:05,178
I have none.

460
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:08,854
Yogoro is head
of the Sasahara family now.

461
00:44:09,424 --> 00:44:12,757
It's all up to him.

462
00:44:13,928 --> 00:44:17,386
But I would like to say one thing.

463
00:44:17,499 --> 00:44:18,625
What is it?

464
00:44:19,234 --> 00:44:22,499
When we accepted Lady Ichi
into our house,

465
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:26,563
it was Steward Takahashi that came.

466
00:44:26,674 --> 00:44:29,268
I'd like him to come again now

467
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:35,115
and explain in his words
why we must return her.

468
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:37,411
If only he could!

469
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:42,623
But it would attract
too much attention.

470
00:44:43,491 --> 00:44:47,052
These are our lord's orders, Isaburo!

471
00:44:47,595 --> 00:44:51,292
Well, I want my lord
to explain his orders to me.

472
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:55,332
When his son's mother
proves inconvenient,

473
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:57,994
he forces her to marry a vassal.

474
00:44:58,406 --> 00:45:03,776
Inconvenienced once again,
he demands her return.

475
00:45:04,045 --> 00:45:07,014
This is cruel and unreasonable.

476
00:45:07,549 --> 00:45:09,779
He has no understanding
of human emotions.

477
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:12,309
No understanding
of human emotions?

478
00:45:13,388 --> 00:45:14,753
Kotani-san,

479
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:19,892
our family didn't accept Ichi
particularly gratefully.

480
00:45:21,062 --> 00:45:25,624
Nor did Ichi herself know Yogoro
or the Sasahara family.

481
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,662
She was none too happy
about it either.

482
00:45:29,304 --> 00:45:33,035
But the reason
they are getting along

483
00:45:33,641 --> 00:45:38,374
is because they're kind to each other
and care for each other.

484
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,007
I understand all that clearly enough.

485
00:45:42,984 --> 00:45:44,576
But Isaburo,

486
00:45:44,986 --> 00:45:47,386
if you continue to be so stubborn,

487
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:50,883
who knows
what might happen to your family.

488
00:45:50,992 --> 00:45:52,289
I don't care.

489
00:45:52,827 --> 00:45:55,990
I will not return Ichi,
even if the heavens rain fire!

490
00:45:56,097 --> 00:45:57,758
What?

491
00:45:58,066 --> 00:46:00,830
Even if the heavens rain fire...
and blood?

492
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:02,529
Wait, Yogoro.

493
00:46:02,637 --> 00:46:04,662
Watch your language!

494
00:46:09,377 --> 00:46:13,177
Kotani-san,
I think this is enough for today.

495
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,152
I beg you.

496
00:46:27,762 --> 00:46:31,926
You should understand, Mother,
being a woman yourself.

497
00:46:33,201 --> 00:46:36,864
If you were in her place,
what would you do?

498
00:46:37,438 --> 00:46:40,896
Would you give up Tomi
and return to the castle?

499
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:42,840
Enough!

500
00:46:43,144 --> 00:46:47,137
Would you ruin our family because
you've lost your head over a woman?

501
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:48,215
In this case -

502
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,415
In this case, it may be unavoidable.

503
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:59,083
Brother!

504
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:03,827
You truly don't care
if you ruin our family?

505
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,359
- I am.
- What?

506
00:47:07,468 --> 00:47:11,768
Bunzo, if you were me,
would you return Ichi?

507
00:47:11,873 --> 00:47:15,741
Of course I would!
You're too attached to her, brother!

508
00:47:15,843 --> 00:47:17,777
Restrain yourself, Bunzo.

509
00:47:21,082 --> 00:47:23,642
Yogoro's the head of the family.

510
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:27,243
Right or wrong, it's all up to him.

511
00:47:46,174 --> 00:47:47,766
Be patient.

512
00:47:48,343 --> 00:47:50,334
Don't lose hope.

513
00:47:50,478 --> 00:47:52,673
If you love Yogoro and Tomi,

514
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,444
be prepared to defy such senseless
conventions, however hard it may be.

515
00:47:57,552 --> 00:48:02,888
I believe that, if worst comes to worst,
you are a wife worth protecting,

516
00:48:02,991 --> 00:48:05,084
even if that means
ruining our family.

517
00:48:07,962 --> 00:48:10,021
I am not worthy of it.

518
00:48:12,533 --> 00:48:16,367
But this won't be the end of it.

519
00:48:55,743 --> 00:48:57,938
I gave her the message.

520
00:48:58,513 --> 00:49:00,447
She will be here soon.

521
00:49:17,899 --> 00:49:20,891
Over here, sister.

522
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:51,594
We've heard all about
what has happened.

523
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:57,705
We relatives and the Sasahara family
have discussed what to do.

524
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:03,599
We've spoken to Yogoro
and know exactly how he feels.

525
00:50:04,278 --> 00:50:10,012
Thus we have come to the conclusion
that the rest is up to you.

526
00:50:10,518 --> 00:50:13,214
We'd like to know
how you feel about it.

527
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,790
Do you want to stay with Yogoro,

528
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:22,488
even if it means
ruining the Sasahara family?

529
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:27,490
Answer us, Ichi!

530
00:50:39,914 --> 00:50:41,404
I would like to stay.

531
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:45,075
Even if you ruin the family?

532
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:47,488
Yes.

533
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,114
Ichi.

534
00:50:51,759 --> 00:50:54,751
Your father, Hyoemon Shiomi,
has asked our lord

535
00:50:55,196 --> 00:51:00,828
that you be sent back to the castle
as soon as possible.

536
00:51:01,736 --> 00:51:03,931
I'm sure you're aware of that.

537
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,535
Not only that.

538
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:13,672
He lies in wait when Yogoro
travels to and from the castle

539
00:51:14,048 --> 00:51:18,246
to plead with him to send you back.

540
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:20,350
He's done this several times.

541
00:51:21,722 --> 00:51:25,624
Father is Father. I am me.

542
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:30,060
I would rather die than return.

543
00:51:33,234 --> 00:51:38,365
Please tell the chamberlains
and steward how I feel

544
00:51:39,106 --> 00:51:43,839
in whatever words
you think will best help my case.

545
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:48,006
If we could do that,
we wouldn't be here like this!

546
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:52,144
We ask you again, Ichi!

547
00:51:52,487 --> 00:51:57,652
Your desire to stay
with Yogoro is final?

548
00:51:57,758 --> 00:52:00,454
The family doesn't matter?

549
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:02,893
Not only the Sasahara family,

550
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:07,559
but we the relatives
will be jeopardized as well.

551
00:52:08,269 --> 00:52:11,727
You still don't care?

552
00:52:14,876 --> 00:52:16,275
It cannot be helped.

553
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:18,812
I see.

554
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,673
There's no use trying
to convince a woman like this.

555
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:26,779
You should give up, Suga.

556
00:52:27,889 --> 00:52:30,016
Yogoro's to blame too.

557
00:52:30,258 --> 00:52:33,557
It's your misfortune that
a woman like her has favored you.

558
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:37,395
Yogoro, you needn't
hold back anymore.

559
00:52:37,765 --> 00:52:41,895
You two go ahead
and ruin your family!

560
00:52:42,737 --> 00:52:47,606
We must prepare
for our involvement as well!

561
00:53:03,324 --> 00:53:08,091
Completely impervious to reason.
No wonder you attacked our lord!

562
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,668
Ichi, I'm sorry.

563
00:53:58,846 --> 00:54:00,074
Return.

564
00:54:00,881 --> 00:54:02,280
Return to the castle.

565
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:45,248
Fool!

566
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,553
Why do you say that now?

567
00:54:49,096 --> 00:54:51,496
What's the Sasahara family to you?

568
00:54:51,866 --> 00:54:54,198
What are your relatives' troubles to you?

569
00:54:57,138 --> 00:54:58,105
Yogoro,

570
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,568
have you decided
you want to keep your position?

571
00:55:11,218 --> 00:55:12,879
Listen to me.

572
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,816
My father-in-law was impressed
with my swordsmanship.

573
00:55:18,192 --> 00:55:20,820
As head of the Sasahara,
he asked me to marry into the family.

574
00:55:20,928 --> 00:55:23,396
But otherwise I have no talents.

575
00:55:24,198 --> 00:55:27,861
In other words, I'm a worthless,
good-for-nothing man.

576
00:55:28,402 --> 00:55:31,371
So in order to prove myself,
for these past 20 years

577
00:55:31,672 --> 00:55:36,541
I have fought to preserve
our good name and social standing.

578
00:55:37,378 --> 00:55:42,213
So why am I so obstinate now?

579
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:46,579
The cruel injustice involved,
for one thing.

580
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:51,651
But your beautiful love
for each other

581
00:55:51,759 --> 00:55:54,728
has touched me most of all.

582
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:59,698
There's never been
a shred of love in my married life!

583
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:02,301
And now you do this!

584
00:56:06,073 --> 00:56:08,200
Promise me, Yogoro,

585
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:11,437
that you'll never let Ichi go!

586
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,209
You too.

587
00:56:14,315 --> 00:56:17,250
No matter what happens,
never leave him!

588
00:56:17,785 --> 00:56:20,345
Promise me, both of you!

589
00:56:30,297 --> 00:56:33,630
My husband's with the chamberlain?

590
00:56:33,734 --> 00:56:37,830
Yes, and he's waiting
for you to come.

591
00:56:39,607 --> 00:56:42,974
I saw him in the castle.

592
00:56:43,277 --> 00:56:45,575
He said he'd be
at the chamberlain's residence

593
00:56:46,113 --> 00:56:50,174
and that you must come at once.

594
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:58,083
The chamberlain wishes to see you both.
He has some questions for you.

595
00:56:59,193 --> 00:57:01,718
But what about Tomi?

596
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:04,764
You needn't worry.
It won't take long.

597
00:57:05,332 --> 00:57:07,596
I will accompany you.

598
00:57:10,771 --> 00:57:12,671
My brother's waiting.

599
00:57:13,774 --> 00:57:17,232
Make yourself clear,
as you did with our relatives.

600
00:57:25,419 --> 00:57:26,750
Sister!

601
00:57:27,388 --> 00:57:30,880
If you lose heart now,
what will it mean for my brother?

602
00:57:32,293 --> 00:57:34,625
Even if it is the chamberlain,

603
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:39,298
show him how determined
you both are to keep your resolve.

604
00:57:41,502 --> 00:57:43,231
Hurry!

605
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:06,752
Sister.

606
00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:27,974
Father, where did you go today?

607
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:30,840
To see Tatewaki.

608
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:35,452
Anything new at the castle?

609
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:38,548
No, nothing yet.

610
00:58:40,094 --> 00:58:41,220
At this rate, perhaps -

611
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:46,361
I hope nothing happens.

612
00:58:51,972 --> 00:58:54,998
Why is Tomi crying like that?
Where's Ichi?

613
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:58,101
- She went out.
- Out?

614
00:58:59,113 --> 00:59:02,742
To the chamberlain's residence,
at about 2:00.

615
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:05,784
What?
The chamberlain's residence?

616
00:59:26,907 --> 00:59:28,169
Mother.

617
00:59:28,275 --> 00:59:30,903
Where's Ichi?
What happened to Ichi?

618
00:59:34,715 --> 00:59:35,682
Where's Bunzo?

619
00:59:53,033 --> 00:59:56,469
Bunzo, where's Ichi?

620
01:00:03,243 --> 01:00:05,006
What's happened to Ichi?

621
01:00:07,214 --> 01:00:09,182
Mother wouldn't say anything.

622
01:00:09,483 --> 01:00:14,477
But Sahei and Nui say you took her
to the chamberlain's residence.

623
01:00:15,022 --> 01:00:17,650
I'm asking you about Ichi!

624
01:00:21,695 --> 01:00:23,185
As a matter of fact -

625
01:00:28,335 --> 01:00:29,893
Bunzo,

626
01:00:30,504 --> 01:00:33,098
you tricked her.

627
01:00:38,846 --> 01:00:42,907
How many times
must we tell you, Ichi?

628
01:00:43,851 --> 01:00:46,786
We had no choice.

629
01:00:48,155 --> 01:00:51,750
No matter
how many times I'm told,

630
01:00:51,859 --> 01:00:54,419
I do not understand.

631
01:00:54,528 --> 01:00:55,825
What?

632
01:00:56,964 --> 01:01:02,402
My husband, child and father
must be worried about me.

633
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:08,804
I'm going home.

634
01:01:11,345 --> 01:01:12,607
Wait, Ichi!

635
01:01:14,715 --> 01:01:18,048
If she doesn't agree
to our requests

636
01:01:18,218 --> 01:01:21,881
and still insists on going home,
then she may do so.

637
01:01:22,623 --> 01:01:24,022
Provided that

638
01:01:24,124 --> 01:01:29,221
she's willing to have Yogoro Sasahara
and his father, Isaburo,

639
01:01:29,863 --> 01:01:32,559
commit seppuku.

640
01:01:37,538 --> 01:01:40,871
Ichi, take my advice

641
01:01:41,575 --> 01:01:44,408
and return to the castle.

642
01:01:45,446 --> 01:01:49,143
If you go back to the castle
obediently without making a fuss,

643
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:53,944
the chamberlain is willing
to overlook everything.

644
01:01:54,354 --> 01:01:59,758
But if you insist on returning home,

645
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:04,160
not only will Yogoro,
but also his father, Isaburo,

646
01:02:04,264 --> 01:02:06,630
be ordered to commit seppuku

647
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:10,268
for lax supervision of their home.

648
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:32,753
Honorable Lady Ichi,
please return to the castle.

649
01:02:36,663 --> 01:02:41,191
You say you're the wife
of footman Bansaku Kariya?

650
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:42,563
Yes.

651
01:02:43,504 --> 01:02:45,631
My name is Kiku.

652
01:02:45,772 --> 01:02:49,469
The chamberlain's orders?
What orders?

653
01:02:50,777 --> 01:02:56,716
He said to come here
every morning and evening

654
01:02:57,351 --> 01:03:01,720
to breast-feed your daughter Tomi.

655
01:03:01,822 --> 01:03:05,223
I want no charity.
Go home!

656
01:03:06,093 --> 01:03:07,390
But...

657
01:03:08,595 --> 01:03:11,063
if I go home without -

658
01:03:12,466 --> 01:03:13,831
Say no more! Go home!

659
01:03:13,934 --> 01:03:16,664
- But -
- Do as I say!

660
01:03:18,305 --> 01:03:19,272
Wait!

661
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,133
Fool.

662
01:03:47,334 --> 01:03:48,301
Tomi, you fool.

663
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:54,330
How can you be so happy
at a strange woman's breast?

664
01:03:55,108 --> 01:03:58,339
Tomi, you fool.

665
01:04:04,918 --> 01:04:06,249
Yogoro.

666
01:04:09,756 --> 01:04:14,386
Starting tomorrow,
do not report to the castle for duty!

667
01:04:14,494 --> 01:04:18,225
I've already
prepared myself for that.

668
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:22,067
How's Yogoro?

669
01:04:22,936 --> 01:04:25,166
He hasn't reported for duty
since these events.

670
01:04:26,473 --> 01:04:30,102
But he did request time off
due to illness.

671
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,472
And Tomi?

672
01:04:32,179 --> 01:04:34,044
The chamberlain ordered

673
01:04:34,147 --> 01:04:40,086
the wife of footman Bansaku Kariya
to come and feed her twice a day.

674
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:48,622
She's healthy and reliable.
A good, solid woman.

675
01:04:51,164 --> 01:04:54,827
Then everything's all over?

676
01:04:55,402 --> 01:04:57,063
Yes.

677
01:04:57,938 --> 01:05:01,772
Certainly since Ichi
has returned to the castle.

678
01:05:09,549 --> 01:05:14,077
In the end, we had no choice
but to have it this way.

679
01:05:14,755 --> 01:05:18,191
We just took a roundabout path.

680
01:05:19,092 --> 01:05:23,586
Defying the clan gets us nowhere.

681
01:05:23,697 --> 01:05:25,289
Isaburo,

682
01:05:25,899 --> 01:05:27,389
do you really mean that?

683
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:34,363
I came to make sure
of your thoughts on this matter.

684
01:05:36,643 --> 01:05:38,042
And now,

685
01:05:38,145 --> 01:05:43,014
I hope you'll forget everything.
Give it up at once.

686
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:45,514
To be honest,

687
01:05:45,786 --> 01:05:48,186
the clan's treatment of your family

688
01:05:48,322 --> 01:05:52,588
and your attitude in response
have weighed on my mind.

689
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,993
Weighed on your mind?

690
01:05:55,095 --> 01:05:56,426
It's like your swordplay.

691
01:06:01,802 --> 01:06:05,829
Pushed, you step back.
Pushed again, you retreat further.

692
01:06:07,307 --> 01:06:11,300
But it's not like you to give up.

693
01:06:13,914 --> 01:06:17,748
The clan didn't ask for her formally.

694
01:06:18,118 --> 01:06:19,676
It was more like force.

695
01:06:20,153 --> 01:06:24,487
In fact, it was more like kidnapping.
They took a vassal's wife.

696
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:32,789
If the shogunate officials in Edo
hear of it, or even the daimyo,

697
01:06:33,266 --> 01:06:36,133
it may prove a fatal mistake
for the Matsudaira.

698
01:06:37,337 --> 01:06:39,999
I can't imagine
things will end like this.

699
01:06:41,341 --> 01:06:44,276
That you'll allow them to end here.

700
01:06:45,445 --> 01:06:47,436
I really don't think so.

701
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:59,557
You're saying I must formally
ask the castle to take her back?

702
01:07:00,293 --> 01:07:02,887
That is all we can do.

703
01:07:03,864 --> 01:07:07,630
It's for the sake
of the Sasahara family.

704
01:07:08,535 --> 01:07:11,436
They've committed an outrage!

705
01:07:11,872 --> 01:07:14,170
Yet I must ask them
to take her back?

706
01:07:14,775 --> 01:07:16,800
We're asking you.

707
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:20,209
And I do understand
how you feel.

708
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:24,214
I was quite afraid you'd storm
the chamberlain's residence.

709
01:07:24,317 --> 01:07:26,683
It was wise of you to hold back.

710
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:32,415
The chamberlain and steward
are impressed by your restraint.

711
01:07:33,226 --> 01:07:36,059
So if you send them your request -

712
01:07:36,163 --> 01:07:37,653
I refuse!

713
01:07:38,965 --> 01:07:43,959
I don't remember
sending her back to the castle.

714
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:45,537
Yogoro.

715
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:50,969
It's all over now.

716
01:07:51,445 --> 01:07:53,538
Why don't you do as he says?

717
01:07:55,215 --> 01:07:56,978
That's ridiculous, Father!

718
01:07:57,584 --> 01:07:59,415
Never!

719
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:02,852
Think of Ichi.

720
01:08:03,323 --> 01:08:05,723
She suppressed her tears,

721
01:08:06,126 --> 01:08:08,686
left everything behind,
and quietly returned to the castle.

722
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:15,468
If I were to think of Ichi,
how could I possibly give up on her?

723
01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:16,763
Yogoro,

724
01:08:17,337 --> 01:08:19,703
that's like calling a doctor
for the dead.

725
01:08:21,641 --> 01:08:23,404
What did you say?

726
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:25,910
Now, now, Yogoro.

727
01:08:26,379 --> 01:08:28,506
Yogoro's young yet.

728
01:08:28,715 --> 01:08:33,778
Isaburo, talk to him
until he understands.

729
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:37,820
It's all for the sake of your family.

730
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:40,953
It's not only for my family,

731
01:08:41,161 --> 01:08:44,722
but for yours too,
and the rest of our kin.

732
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:52,032
In any case, please go for now.

733
01:08:53,139 --> 01:08:58,304
Yogoro will be hard to convince,
but I'll talk to him.

734
01:08:58,411 --> 01:08:59,969
Give me a few days.

735
01:09:02,282 --> 01:09:06,844
Yogoro will report today
and say he wishes to return her?

736
01:09:07,153 --> 01:09:08,950
Yes.

737
01:09:09,356 --> 01:09:11,517
That's wonderful.

738
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:16,288
Thank you for your trouble.

739
01:09:17,564 --> 01:09:20,158
All has turned out well in the end.

740
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:25,533
Now we can look forward
to the Suwa Shrine festival tomorrow.

741
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,572
Tomorrow is the Inoko festival?

742
01:09:29,776 --> 01:09:33,644
Since it would have
come to this anyway,

743
01:09:33,747 --> 01:09:36,841
how dare they cause all that fuss!

744
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:42,520
Yogoro was wrong,
but Isaburo was insolent as well.

745
01:09:42,622 --> 01:09:44,146
Yes.

746
01:09:44,424 --> 01:09:47,723
He's always henpecked by his wife.

747
01:09:48,028 --> 01:09:50,997
And defying clan orders like that -

748
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:53,927
I must say
he seems like a different man.

749
01:09:54,234 --> 01:09:59,763
It's settled now,
so we needn't criticize him.

750
01:10:01,775 --> 01:10:04,573
His conduct has been admirable.

751
01:10:04,678 --> 01:10:08,375
It calls for
a slight increase in his fief.

752
01:10:08,715 --> 01:10:13,982
Yogoro Sasahara
of the escort group has arrived!

753
01:10:40,113 --> 01:10:41,978
I'm glad you've reported for duty.

754
01:10:42,315 --> 01:10:45,716
We heard you were sick.
Are you well now?

755
01:10:45,819 --> 01:10:48,379
Yes, completely well.

756
01:10:48,822 --> 01:10:50,346
And so?

757
01:10:52,626 --> 01:10:57,825
Taking into consideration
my father's wishes, I have decided.

758
01:10:58,298 --> 01:10:59,526
Please accept this.

759
01:11:05,372 --> 01:11:08,466
That's good of you.
Thank you.

760
01:11:48,715 --> 01:11:49,773
Fool!

761
01:11:49,883 --> 01:11:52,113
What's gotten into you?

762
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:59,053
"Petition.

763
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:04,426
Ichi, the wife of
my eldest son Yogoro,

764
01:12:04,864 --> 01:12:09,096
was unlawfully kidnapped
and forced to return to the castle.

765
01:12:09,202 --> 01:12:11,568
This is the cruelest form of tyranny.

766
01:12:11,771 --> 01:12:15,798
It runs counter
to the laws of humanity

767
01:12:15,909 --> 01:12:18,469
and cannot be
condoned by the heavens.

768
01:12:18,712 --> 01:12:23,945
We hereby appeal
for her immediate return.

769
01:12:24,484 --> 01:12:27,783
If our petition is refused,

770
01:12:27,887 --> 01:12:30,481
this shameless act of tyranny

771
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:34,754
on the part of Masakata Matsudaira,
lord of the Aizu domain,

772
01:12:34,961 --> 01:12:36,758
and his retainers

773
01:12:36,996 --> 01:12:41,695
shall be made known
throughout Japan's 60 provinces.

774
01:12:42,335 --> 01:12:47,773
November 18th, 1727, 2:00.

775
01:12:47,874 --> 01:12:50,809
Isaburo Sasahara, Aizu clansman."

776
01:12:55,348 --> 01:12:57,373
A word of caution.

777
01:12:58,384 --> 01:13:02,548
Someone may use
my father's name or my own

778
01:13:03,089 --> 01:13:06,217
to submit a request
to return Ichi to the castle.

779
01:13:06,326 --> 01:13:11,093
But it will not be from us.
It will be a false request.

780
01:13:11,364 --> 01:13:13,059
Please keep that in mind.

781
01:13:13,399 --> 01:13:14,491
Excuse me.

782
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,657
Thank you for coming every day.

783
01:14:18,164 --> 01:14:21,759
With the Inoko festival starting tomorrow,
you must be busy.

784
01:14:22,535 --> 01:14:24,264
Master.

785
01:14:25,271 --> 01:14:28,172
We're just airing the house out a bit.

786
01:14:29,142 --> 01:14:30,404
But -

787
01:14:31,144 --> 01:14:32,475
The mats?

788
01:14:33,413 --> 01:14:36,473
It's a custom at times like these.

789
01:14:36,983 --> 01:14:38,974
So our feet won't slip in the blood.

790
01:14:42,789 --> 01:14:46,657
Tomi's been waiting for you.

791
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:53,262
Let her drink her fill.

792
01:14:53,499 --> 01:14:56,332
This may be the last time.

793
01:15:12,518 --> 01:15:14,850
Will you do me a favor?

794
01:15:14,954 --> 01:15:19,391
Will you cook the rice
after you feed Tomi?

795
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,794
I dismissed all our servants.

796
01:15:22,996 --> 01:15:28,832
I also sent Suga and Bunzo away
so we'd have a little more room.

797
01:15:29,168 --> 01:15:31,159
Just cook the rice.

798
01:15:31,337 --> 01:15:33,669
We'll make the rice balls ourselves.

799
01:15:33,873 --> 01:15:35,864
Can't fight on an empty stomach.

800
01:15:39,145 --> 01:15:40,407
Excuse me!

801
01:15:40,847 --> 01:15:42,747
Excuse me!

802
01:15:54,961 --> 01:15:56,485
Orders from our lord!

803
01:15:56,796 --> 01:15:57,820
Accept obediently!

804
01:16:02,602 --> 01:16:04,536
I said orders from our lord!

805
01:16:05,438 --> 01:16:06,837
Will you not obey?

806
01:16:07,674 --> 01:16:11,770
It's too late for orders now!

807
01:16:11,878 --> 01:16:13,709
Now, now, Yogoro.

808
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:17,741
Let's hear what the orders are.

809
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:20,252
Orders!

810
01:16:22,522 --> 01:16:25,787
Isaburo and Yogoro Sasahara,

811
01:16:26,526 --> 01:16:30,087
for your insolent conduct
and defiance toward our lord,

812
01:16:30,897 --> 01:16:32,524
you are ordered to commit seppuku.

813
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:34,963
Seppuku?

814
01:16:36,736 --> 01:16:40,194
It is gracious of our lord
to permit it.

815
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:45,809
I thought men would come arrest us

816
01:16:45,912 --> 01:16:49,313
and then either hang or crucify us.

817
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:52,913
We will bravely commit seppuku.

818
01:16:53,886 --> 01:16:54,875
Father.

819
01:16:54,988 --> 01:16:56,922
However,

820
01:16:57,023 --> 01:16:59,924
we want something
before we kill ourselves.

821
01:17:00,326 --> 01:17:01,623
Bring us three heads!

822
01:17:02,161 --> 01:17:03,128
What?

823
01:17:03,696 --> 01:17:07,996
Those of Lord Masakata Matsudaira,
ruler of the Aizu domain,

824
01:17:08,134 --> 01:17:10,762
Chamberlain Yanase,

825
01:17:10,937 --> 01:17:13,633
and Steward Takahashi.

826
01:17:14,173 --> 01:17:19,975
Bring me the heads of the villains
who took my son's wife!

827
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,480
You!

828
01:17:29,222 --> 01:17:34,888
Vassal Tatewaki Asano in charge
of boundary gates has arrived!

829
01:17:57,483 --> 01:18:00,680
Tatewaki, I called you
for nothing other than this.

830
01:18:00,887 --> 01:18:06,325
Prepare at once to kill
Isaburo and Yogoro Sasahara.

831
01:18:09,262 --> 01:18:12,527
I hear you are

832
01:18:12,632 --> 01:18:16,261
Isaburo's only equal
as a swordsman.

833
01:18:17,236 --> 01:18:19,966
If you think he's too much for you,

834
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:24,801
take four or five
strong men with you.

835
01:18:27,046 --> 01:18:28,638
This is a strange request.

836
01:18:30,316 --> 01:18:31,806
What?

837
01:18:33,019 --> 01:18:38,924
The Sasaharas
have defied clan orders.

838
01:18:39,859 --> 01:18:45,024
Are they not now criminals
in the eyes of our clan?

839
01:18:45,598 --> 01:18:46,690
Yes.

840
01:18:47,233 --> 01:18:52,364
Then it's the superintendent's duty
to arrest them.

841
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:58,734
I'm in charge of border gates.

842
01:18:58,911 --> 01:19:00,879
In other words,

843
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:05,713
my duty is to keep track of those
leaving or entering our land.

844
01:19:07,053 --> 01:19:12,389
Since when have I become
a superintendent?

845
01:19:16,896 --> 01:19:22,357
This is no time to discuss jurisdiction.

846
01:19:23,369 --> 01:19:25,234
You're wrong.

847
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:32,578
The trouble began in an attempt
to adhere to daimyo rules

848
01:19:33,246 --> 01:19:37,546
stating that the mother
of our lord's heir

849
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:41,377
must not remain a vassal's wife.

850
01:19:42,121 --> 01:19:44,851
We must follow the rules.

851
01:19:46,259 --> 01:19:49,422
If you order me to kill them,

852
01:19:49,695 --> 01:19:55,361
please promote me
to superintendent here and now

853
01:19:55,735 --> 01:19:59,466
and obtain our lord's promise
to increase my fief to 500 koku,

854
01:19:59,572 --> 01:20:01,597
according to clan rules.

855
01:20:01,707 --> 01:20:03,231
Tatewaki.

856
01:20:03,843 --> 01:20:06,676
You've gone too far.
Why be so formal now?

857
01:20:07,246 --> 01:20:08,713
Never mind. Go!

858
01:20:08,814 --> 01:20:14,252
We must gather men,
use force and kill them.

859
01:20:15,788 --> 01:20:16,755
Get ready.

860
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,587
A foolish idea.

861
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:20,022
What?

862
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,589
Isaburo's a swordsman without peer.

863
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:30,491
You'll only make more trouble
by sending men.

864
01:20:32,271 --> 01:20:34,569
In order to settle matters quietly,

865
01:20:34,674 --> 01:20:38,542
send Lady Ichi back to the Sasahara family
for now, and then later -

866
01:20:38,744 --> 01:20:41,838
What?
Don't talk nonsense!

867
01:20:41,948 --> 01:20:43,108
But Chamberlain,

868
01:20:44,283 --> 01:20:49,949
resort to violence and you'll have
mountains of dead and wounded men.

869
01:21:01,767 --> 01:21:03,359
Cold, isn't it?

870
01:21:16,282 --> 01:21:18,045
What time is it?

871
01:21:18,951 --> 01:21:21,886
Past 9:00, I think.

872
01:21:26,726 --> 01:21:29,718
Eat in moderation.
That should be enough for you.

873
01:21:40,873 --> 01:21:43,205
Someone's coming.

874
01:21:49,982 --> 01:21:52,712
From the footsteps, he's alone.

875
01:21:57,757 --> 01:21:59,315
It's Bunzo.

876
01:22:13,906 --> 01:22:17,034
Don't just stand there.
Come around here!

877
01:22:45,571 --> 01:22:47,004
Father!

878
01:22:47,873 --> 01:22:49,636
Don't talk.

879
01:22:50,509 --> 01:22:53,239
I know what you want to say.

880
01:22:54,547 --> 01:22:56,777
Now, come in.

881
01:22:57,583 --> 01:22:59,107
Father!

882
01:23:00,886 --> 01:23:03,719
Come in, Bunzo.

883
01:23:07,026 --> 01:23:07,993
Father!

884
01:23:08,961 --> 01:23:12,692
Is it nice and cozy
at Kenmotsu's place?

885
01:23:13,466 --> 01:23:15,400
Have a drink.

886
01:23:16,302 --> 01:23:18,463
Listen to the festival drums.

887
01:23:19,572 --> 01:23:20,800
Father!

888
01:23:20,906 --> 01:23:24,967
I know what you want to say.

889
01:23:26,779 --> 01:23:30,840
You were pressed by our relatives
at Kenmotsu's place

890
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:33,846
to come here
as their messenger and say,

891
01:23:34,587 --> 01:23:37,852
"We've defied our lord long enough.

892
01:23:38,357 --> 01:23:42,418
Now obey clan orders
with good grace."

893
01:23:42,628 --> 01:23:43,925
Father.

894
01:23:48,534 --> 01:23:51,196
Have a drink.

895
01:24:04,984 --> 01:24:07,043
Bunzo, don't hate us.

896
01:24:11,957 --> 01:24:16,917
Not only you and Mother
will be punished, but our kin too,

897
01:24:18,230 --> 01:24:23,463
for being related
to such reckless men.

898
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:25,964
Father.

899
01:24:27,973 --> 01:24:30,771
But remember:

900
01:24:31,444 --> 01:24:34,277
Each must live his own life.

901
01:24:36,148 --> 01:24:38,173
As for what happened,

902
01:24:38,384 --> 01:24:43,117
I don't blame you and Suga
for what you did,

903
01:24:43,222 --> 01:24:45,247
nor do I bear you any grudge.

904
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:50,117
Each must live his own life.

905
01:24:52,465 --> 01:24:55,093
Have a drink and then go back.

906
01:24:56,101 --> 01:24:59,070
And tell everyone this for me:

907
01:25:00,773 --> 01:25:04,300
I, Isaburo Sasahara, in all my life

908
01:25:04,477 --> 01:25:09,414
have never felt
more alive than I do now.

909
01:25:19,058 --> 01:25:24,928
Prepare for our lord's entrance!

910
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:45,114
Haven't you taken
care of Sasahara yet?

911
01:25:53,492 --> 01:25:54,959
What are you doing?

912
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:58,086
A mere clansman has defied me
and the entire clan.

913
01:25:58,197 --> 01:26:01,997
What if other clans hear of this,
Sanzaemon?

914
01:26:06,672 --> 01:26:09,106
Gather some men
and take care of it yourself.

915
01:26:09,608 --> 01:26:10,597
Before dawn.

916
01:26:12,378 --> 01:26:15,142
- Yes, but -
- What?

917
01:26:15,748 --> 01:26:18,911
The chamberlain's intervention
would aggravate matters.

918
01:26:19,018 --> 01:26:20,815
Please allow me.

919
01:26:21,453 --> 01:26:24,889
You'll go, Geki?

920
01:26:57,323 --> 01:27:00,690
Father, the drum
from the Suwa Shrine has stopped.

921
01:27:03,762 --> 01:27:06,754
It's late. They're probably
done for the night.

922
01:27:09,835 --> 01:27:15,774
Two years ago today,
we were asked to accept Ichi.

923
01:27:17,176 --> 01:27:19,007
I remember it too.

924
01:27:19,645 --> 01:27:24,105
Outside the castle, it was the Inoko
festival, when the harvest god left.

925
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:30,588
Inside the castle, it was the day
before the Suwa Shrine festival.

926
01:27:32,758 --> 01:27:34,225
Father.

927
01:27:37,997 --> 01:27:39,225
I may seem unmanly -

928
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,760
What is it?

929
01:27:42,868 --> 01:27:47,271
For some reason,
I am more worried...

930
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:52,743
about Ichi's future than Tomi's.

931
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,910
That's as it should be.

932
01:27:58,717 --> 01:28:01,481
It's not unmanly at all.

933
01:28:03,122 --> 01:28:09,061
Your feelings for each other
gave me new life.

934
01:28:17,336 --> 01:28:18,394
But Yogoro,

935
01:28:20,205 --> 01:28:23,003
don't be too worried about Ichi.

936
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:27,272
We will die here,

937
01:28:27,646 --> 01:28:31,047
but she is the mother
of our lord's heir.

938
01:28:33,652 --> 01:28:37,053
No one can torture her,

939
01:28:37,322 --> 01:28:41,884
and no one will endanger her life.

940
01:28:46,665 --> 01:28:50,999
But Father,
aren't they late in coming?

941
01:30:53,292 --> 01:30:55,817
I meant to ask
for permission to enter,

942
01:30:56,361 --> 01:31:00,058
but the gate was open, so I came in.

943
01:31:00,866 --> 01:31:02,424
Forgive me.

944
01:32:05,297 --> 01:32:09,791
I will now convey our lord's orders.

945
01:32:12,604 --> 01:32:15,971
We have heard of the order
to commit seppuku.

946
01:32:16,642 --> 01:32:17,870
No.

947
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:21,078
He changed his orders.

948
01:32:22,414 --> 01:32:26,316
Isaburo and Yogoro Sasahara,

949
01:32:27,419 --> 01:32:30,183
for your insolence
and attitude toward our lord,

950
01:32:30,989 --> 01:32:35,983
you will be confined
at Enshoji Temple outside the castle.

951
01:32:38,964 --> 01:32:43,594
A very light punishment
compared to seppuku.

952
01:32:43,702 --> 01:32:45,067
Why the sudden change?

953
01:32:45,804 --> 01:32:51,436
Lady Ichi,
the mother of our lord's heir,

954
01:32:52,444 --> 01:32:56,141
was once a family member here.

955
01:32:56,615 --> 01:33:00,745
She pleaded with our lord
to save your lives.

956
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:14,730
Will you gratefully accept
our lord's new orders?

957
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,931
No.

958
01:33:17,102 --> 01:33:18,592
No, he's wrong!

959
01:33:19,838 --> 01:33:22,705
As Yogoro Sasahara's wife,

960
01:33:23,241 --> 01:33:26,836
I appealed through the chief maid,
Yoshino, to my lord

961
01:33:26,945 --> 01:33:29,937
to save my father and husband.

962
01:33:31,049 --> 01:33:33,711
It was not as the heir's mother.

963
01:33:34,686 --> 01:33:36,153
I am...

964
01:33:37,689 --> 01:33:42,285
I am still the wife
of Yogoro Sasahara.

965
01:33:49,768 --> 01:33:53,795
To tell you the truth,
what Lady Ichi says is correct.

966
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:57,732
But our lord received me
in his audience.

967
01:33:58,243 --> 01:34:01,804
If she appeals to save you

968
01:34:02,514 --> 01:34:08,453
as the heir's mother,
not as Yogoro's wife,

969
01:34:09,388 --> 01:34:14,849
he promised to change his orders
from seppuku to confinement.

970
01:34:18,096 --> 01:34:21,293
I don't understand
what this is all about.

971
01:34:21,933 --> 01:34:23,764
Neither do I.

972
01:34:24,569 --> 01:34:25,536
Steward,

973
01:34:26,671 --> 01:34:31,870
it seems we don't understand
what you just told us.

974
01:34:32,744 --> 01:34:35,440
It's very simple.

975
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:40,680
If you two admit that
Ichi is no longer a family member

976
01:34:40,786 --> 01:34:43,254
and that she has been returned,

977
01:34:43,355 --> 01:34:48,224
our lord will listen to her plea
for a lighter punishment.

978
01:34:49,194 --> 01:34:52,721
Will you acknowledge
her return and live,

979
01:34:52,898 --> 01:34:56,561
or refuse and fight it out?

980
01:34:56,902 --> 01:34:57,891
Which will it be?

981
01:34:58,537 --> 01:35:02,633
In that case,
we ask for no mercy.

982
01:35:03,275 --> 01:35:06,733
We are prepared for the worst.

983
01:35:08,246 --> 01:35:12,478
Then there is no alternative?

984
01:35:12,584 --> 01:35:14,176
None.

985
01:35:17,155 --> 01:35:20,613
It's all of you who cannot
be pardoned,

986
01:35:20,959 --> 01:35:24,326
who are holding
Yogoro's wife as prisoner

987
01:35:24,429 --> 01:35:26,260
and still insist on doing so.

988
01:35:26,364 --> 01:35:28,423
Please return her at once!

989
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:46,406
All right.

990
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:53,253
You've made yourselves very clear.

991
01:35:57,496 --> 01:36:01,830
I'll ask Lady Ichi now.

992
01:36:03,068 --> 01:36:04,797
Lady Ichi,

993
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:08,467
will you save the lives of these men?

994
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:14,603
Or will you let their pursuers
come and kill them?

995
01:36:15,413 --> 01:36:20,373
Lady Ichi,
the Sasaharas are men.

996
01:36:20,485 --> 01:36:23,454
Their pride will not
let them back down.

997
01:36:23,788 --> 01:36:26,120
But your position is different.

998
01:36:26,224 --> 01:36:28,624
You have already
returned to serve our lord.

999
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,828
If you tell them

1000
01:36:30,929 --> 01:36:36,799
that you sever your ties with them
once and for all,

1001
01:36:36,902 --> 01:36:39,427
then all will be well!

1002
01:36:40,172 --> 01:36:41,901
Is that clear?

1003
01:36:42,507 --> 01:36:47,410
If you do,
their lives will be saved.

1004
01:36:47,979 --> 01:36:51,710
We need not ask them to return you.

1005
01:36:51,816 --> 01:36:55,308
And even though
they petition for your return,

1006
01:36:55,720 --> 01:37:00,817
it can be disregarded
as long as you sever your ties with them.

1007
01:37:01,059 --> 01:37:02,026
Wait!

1008
01:37:02,127 --> 01:37:03,492
Don't move!

1009
01:37:16,808 --> 01:37:18,708
Don't move.

1010
01:37:19,344 --> 01:37:22,438
If you do,
unexpected accidents may occur.

1011
01:37:28,653 --> 01:37:30,553
Lady Ichi,

1012
01:37:31,690 --> 01:37:35,922
will you sever your ties with them
and save their lives?

1013
01:37:36,595 --> 01:37:39,223
Or will you let them die as traitors?

1014
01:37:40,298 --> 01:37:41,856
What will your answer be?

1015
01:37:47,138 --> 01:37:49,003
Lady Ichi,

1016
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:55,005
does your silence mean
you will do as I say?

1017
01:37:55,113 --> 01:37:56,910
Am I correct?

1018
01:38:00,385 --> 01:38:01,909
No.

1019
01:38:02,921 --> 01:38:04,388
I -

1020
01:38:05,123 --> 01:38:08,490
What will you do then?

1021
01:39:06,584 --> 01:39:07,551
Kill them!

1022
01:39:38,049 --> 01:39:39,277
Father.

1023
01:39:43,755 --> 01:39:45,245
Yogoro!

1024
01:39:46,725 --> 01:39:48,488
Father...

1025
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:27,581
Tomi,

1026
01:42:28,186 --> 01:42:30,416
bid your father and mother farewell.

1027
01:42:34,859 --> 01:42:38,420
Have a good look at them.

1028
01:42:40,598 --> 01:42:44,432
They are your father and mother.

1029
01:42:48,172 --> 01:42:51,630
Let us who are still alive
listen to them.

1030
01:42:52,210 --> 01:42:56,510
Let's listen to what
they want us to do.

1031
01:42:57,315 --> 01:43:00,773
No, I know without being told.

1032
01:43:03,621 --> 01:43:09,560
I know how they felt
about their plight and their death.

1033
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:17,493
They want us to tell the world
of our clan's cruelty!

1034
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:25,535
Very well. I understand.

1035
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:33,040
We promise to do that for you.

1036
01:43:33,151 --> 01:43:36,552
We'll topple the Aizu clan
from its pedestal!

1037
01:44:13,024 --> 01:44:17,120
First, Tomi and I will go
to Edo together

1038
01:44:17,528 --> 01:44:19,587
and see the shogunate elders.

1039
01:44:21,265 --> 01:44:23,597
We'll leave immediately for Edo.

1040
01:46:07,872 --> 01:46:12,138
Isaburo Sasahara
of the escort group...

1041
01:46:13,177 --> 01:46:14,701
where are you going?

1042
01:46:16,047 --> 01:46:18,914
Tomi and I are going to Edo.

1043
01:46:19,984 --> 01:46:22,612
If this is for the clan,
show me your pass.

1044
01:46:22,987 --> 01:46:28,050
If it's private business,
show me the clan ticket.

1045
01:46:29,127 --> 01:46:30,890
I have neither.

1046
01:46:31,896 --> 01:46:35,832
Then I'm afraid
I cannot let you pass.

1047
01:46:37,702 --> 01:46:41,900
We must go to Edo
though we have no permit.

1048
01:46:43,007 --> 01:46:47,273
You mean to
pass from this domain

1049
01:46:47,578 --> 01:46:51,139
without having either?

1050
01:46:51,616 --> 01:46:52,878
Yes.

1051
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:55,712
To carry out my duty

1052
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:59,381
and uphold my honor as a samurai,

1053
01:46:59,490 --> 01:47:00,718
I must forbid it.

1054
01:47:01,926 --> 01:47:05,555
If you insist on breaking our law
and passing through this gate,

1055
01:47:06,197 --> 01:47:10,531
I must stop you
at the risk of my life.

1056
01:47:11,669 --> 01:47:13,068
That can't be helped.

1057
01:47:23,548 --> 01:47:25,709
She is very quiet.

1058
01:47:27,185 --> 01:47:31,281
I'd like to put her in the house
away from the wind.

1059
01:47:31,823 --> 01:47:34,986
But men we dislike are in there.

1060
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:39,227
Venomous men.

1061
01:47:56,814 --> 01:48:01,581
I fed her before dawn.
I don't think she's hungry.

1062
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:06,383
But I'll give the poor thing
a little more.

1063
01:48:09,126 --> 01:48:11,185
Before feeding babies rice,

1064
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:15,428
we're supposed to wait
100 days after birth...

1065
01:48:17,101 --> 01:48:20,070
when enough teeth have come in.

1066
01:48:21,906 --> 01:48:23,464
But I'll do it now.

1067
01:48:23,574 --> 01:48:25,906
Tomi, here.

1068
01:48:31,849 --> 01:48:37,446
All the family members are supposed
to celebrate this day together

1069
01:48:38,222 --> 01:48:41,055
with red bean rice and live fish.

1070
01:48:41,659 --> 01:48:44,753
That's impossible now.
We'll make do with this.

1071
01:49:01,879 --> 01:49:05,280
You be quiet now, Tomi.

1072
01:49:07,084 --> 01:49:10,247
Don't cry even if I don't return.

1073
01:49:11,322 --> 01:49:12,983
In that case,

1074
01:49:14,625 --> 01:49:18,527
he will become your foster father
and raise you.

1075
01:49:37,748 --> 01:49:38,715
Well, then.

1076
01:49:42,853 --> 01:49:46,983
Lose this duel. Let me remain.

1077
01:49:48,893 --> 01:49:50,520
It's better that way.

1078
01:49:50,628 --> 01:49:51,595
What?

1079
01:49:53,831 --> 01:49:55,196
Isaburo,

1080
01:49:56,434 --> 01:49:58,129
lose to me.

1081
01:50:00,104 --> 01:50:01,071
For Tomi's sake.

1082
01:50:02,406 --> 01:50:03,634
No.

1083
01:50:04,442 --> 01:50:09,971
No matter how strong you are,
how perfect your defense,

1084
01:50:10,414 --> 01:50:15,283
I'll defeat you
and go to Edo with Tomi.

1085
01:50:19,056 --> 01:50:20,421
Then...

1086
01:50:21,292 --> 01:50:22,850
I will win.

1087
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:27,220
Without fail.

1088
01:50:29,767 --> 01:50:31,428
I will win without fail.

1089
01:53:36,453 --> 01:53:37,420
Tatewaki!

1090
01:53:41,258 --> 01:53:45,695
Three people helped you.

1091
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:50,928
Yogoro, Ichi and Tomi.

1092
01:53:53,571 --> 01:53:56,165
I had no chance of winning.

1093
01:53:58,275 --> 01:53:59,674
Hurry.

1094
01:54:00,477 --> 01:54:02,843
Take Tomi with you to Edo.

1095
01:54:04,615 --> 01:54:05,946
Tatewaki!

1096
01:58:15,265 --> 01:58:17,699
We can't go to Edo anymore!

1097
01:58:29,413 --> 01:58:34,180
We can't go to Edo anymore.

1098
01:58:41,725 --> 01:58:47,425
No one will ever know the story
of your father and mother now.

1099
01:58:50,968 --> 01:58:55,598
Tomi, it can't be helped.

1100
01:58:56,773 --> 01:58:59,071
But let me say one word.

1101
01:59:00,477 --> 01:59:02,308
Just one word.

1102
01:59:09,253 --> 01:59:13,019
When you grow up,

1103
01:59:13,991 --> 01:59:16,960
become a woman
just like your mother.

1104
01:59:18,962 --> 01:59:22,659
And marry a man

1105
01:59:23,667 --> 01:59:26,727
just like your father.

1106
01:59:29,006 --> 01:59:31,497
Be sure to do that.

1107
01:59:32,042 --> 01:59:36,172
Marry a man just like your father.

1108
01:59:37,073 --> 01:59:51,073

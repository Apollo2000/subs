1
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,238
Merry Christmas Eve, bitch.

2
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,114
Hi.

3
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,750
Are we supposed to share it?

4
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,913
Yes, we're supposed
to share it, bitch. I am broke.

5
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,426
- How've you been?
- I've been great.

6
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,212
You finally got tits, bitch!

7
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,221
Bitch, the estrogen
has been kicking in,

8
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,740
the only thing it hasn't broken down
was these fucking arms.

9
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,237
Everything else on my body
looks good.

10
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,260
- Oh, honey.
- Don't you try it.

11
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,519
I look like the real thing.

12
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,430
So, I got some good news to tell you.

13
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,515
- What?
- I've been keeping a secret

14
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,434
about me and Chester.

15
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,275
Girl... Whoo!
I know what it is!

16
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,905
You're breaking up with him!

17
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,861
Thank God.

18
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,384
Because honey, if he's gonna be
cheating on you like that...

19
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,028
Wait, wait, wait. What?

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,043
You didn't know?

21
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,542
How the fuck would I know?

22
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,882
Girl, because everything that
you've been hearing on the block

23
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,968
about the girl that he's been with.

24
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,170
Girl, you are the first girl
I've seen on the block.

25
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,928
Who is she?

26
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,893
Girl, she's some white fish.
I don't know.

27
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,976
Chester is fucking cheating on me
with real fish?

28
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,902
Yeah, bitch. Like a real fish girl,
like vagina and everything.

29
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:28,282
I've been gone for 28 fucking days!

30
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,908
And you mean to tell me
that he's been out here

31
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,284
cheating on me with fish?

32
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,029
Yeah.

33
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,031
Do I know her?

34
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't know. I just know that
her name starts with a D.

35
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,206
It's something like...

36
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,625
Danielle...

37
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,505
Desiree...

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,169
- Dee Dee... I don't know, girl!
- Give me your fucking phone!

39
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,963
It was shut off.
I had to cover your rent last month.

40
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,181
I've been told you
this was gonna happen.

41
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,435
All men cheat.

42
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,903
That's why they're called trade.

43
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,360
Do them just as dirty as they do us.

44
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,868
Out here it's all about our hustle,

45
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,033
and that's it.

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,457
What are you plotting?

47
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,682
Merry Fucking Christmas.

48
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,901
Hey girl, you back from vacation?

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,233
Bitch, it's a motherfucking disco
out here, bitch.

50
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,363
Why?

51
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,682
Where the fuck is Chester at?

52
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,910
I don't know who the fuck
this bitch is,

53
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,285
but it's a white bitch.

54
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,863
It's a white real fish.

55
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,370
Girl, don't he have a lot of girls
that he been messing with, girl?

56
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,291
Something with a D!
Something with a D! Desiree...

57
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,797
- Dominique...
- Destiny?

58
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,924
Bitch, I don't know what the fuck
her name is, bitch!

59
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,720
Why do fish come in to our territory?

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,600
Cause when they're Jane, girl,
they're jade.

61
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,676
Want to smoke some weed?
I got some weed.

62
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,566
Bitch, you know I don't do downers,
bitch. You know I'm an upper ho.

63
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,272
- Sin-Dee.
- Oh, hey, Alexandra.

64
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,903
Girl, give me a hug.

65
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,064
See you later, God bless.

66
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,024
OK, I got you.

67
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,698
Girl, calm the fuck down,
it's not that serious.

68
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,529
Not that serious
my fucking ass, girl.

69
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,618
I already told you,
it's just a rumor.

70
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,454
You don't know just yet if it's true.

71
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,742
Bitch,
I've been hearing shit in jail,

72
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,910
I've been hearing shit out here.

73
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,556
I don't know the fuck
is real anymore.

74
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,848
Sin-Dee!

75
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,763
Calm your ass down now
or I am going home!

76
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,066
- Oh, girl, shut your ass up!
- That's it! I am going home!

77
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,486
White Boy!
Where the fuck is Chester?

78
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,150
I don't know.
I haven't seen him all day.

79
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,033
What the fuck you mean
you haven't seen him?

80
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,864
- Oh, hey, what's the T bitch?
- Girl, what's your T?

81
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,279
Have you seen that
white bitch either?

82
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,118
I haven't seen anybody,
leave me the fuck alone.

83
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,907
- Take these flyers.
- OK, OK...

84
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,875
Please be there tonight.
Don't disappoint me.

85
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,081
I will. I will be there.

86
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,924
You want me to walk all the way
to Vermont?

87
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,789
- Mary's at 7:00.
- OK.

88
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,335
- Mary's at 7:00. Mary's at 7:00.
- OK.

89
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,879
I will be there, I promise.

90
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,547
Now, I've got to deal
with this bitch over here.

91
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,839
She's getting on my fucking nerves.

92
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,528
- You got any T on you?
- No, I don't.

93
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,597
Are you sure?

94
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,516
Yes, I am sure!
You're making me lose my game.

95
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,324
This is what the fuck
I'm dealing with.

96
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,519
I cannot take it no more.

97
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,688
- Bye.
- Bye.

98
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,896
Girl, wait, wait, wait.
I cannot do this.

99
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,314
I cannot do this,
it's too much drama.

100
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,027
You just come out here and give me
all this information.

101
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,113
To have me go handle it by myself.
You're the one who told me anyways.

102
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,825
OK, OK, OK! I will go with you
under one condition.

103
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,372
You must promise to me that
there's not gonna be any drama.

104
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,732
Because as soon as there's
some drama, I'm out of there!

105
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,668
I promise. I promise.

106
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,878
Look at me in my eyes and promise!

107
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,041
I promise no drama, Alexandra!

108
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,792
Come on!

109
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,311
What the
fuck you two looking at?

110
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,401
Bitch, like I am clockablel

111
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,285
You can't get it on me, bitch,
you can't get it on me, bitch.

112
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,491
I am fierce as fuck.

113
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,246
I don't know what the fuck
she was tripping on, girl.

114
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,448
True.

115
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,629
1351 Orange?

116
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,593
- Yes, please.
- Alright.

117
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,726
Is that a dog or a cat?

118
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,971
A dog.

119
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,183
What's the name?

120
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,435
Alfie.

121
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,860
Alfie is a very
well behaved dog, huh?

122
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,569
It's so quiet.

123
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,990
It's empty.

124
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,461
And his breath always smells like
he's been eating ass for days!

125
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,881
I mean when I walk into the room, it
shouldn't always smell like homeless.

126
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,259
And those socks, why are those socks
so fucking black!

127
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,962
That's not a pimp.
What do you see in him?

128
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,630
Why are you looking for him?

129
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,549
Girl, you right! You right!

130
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,887
It ain't his ass I should be
worried about.

131
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,302
It should be that bitch.
She's the one trying

132
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,030
to come on my man.
Bitch, you're smart!

133
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,225
I'm gonna fuck her up!

134
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,141
- That's not what I meant!
- That's exactly what you meant!

135
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,479
Because that bitch wants
to try with me.

136
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,814
- I didn't mean that!
- I can give pussy,

137
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,058
it's called a fucking tuck.

138
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,769
Oh, my God!
Look, there's Sin-Dee!

139
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,647
I haven't seen her for so long, girl.
She's looking good!

140
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,900
Oh, girl! What's up? What's the T?

141
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,146
Sin-Dee! Oh, my God.

142
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,780
So how was it, bitch?

143
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,986
Tell me the T!

144
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,990
Did you get a lot of trade
up in there or what?

145
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,074
I want you guys to come
to my show tonight.

146
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,863
I am so excited about that!

147
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,449
T was the night before Alexandra.

148
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,871
Stunning goddess...

149
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,877
7:00 pm sharp!

150
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,676
Has any of you motherfuckers
seen Chester?

151
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,755
- No, not me.
- Here we go again.

152
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,916
Girl, she saw hisself
trying to cheat on me.

153
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,937
While I'm up in there, girl!
Me, bitch!

154
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,638
- I wish I never told her.
- I heard about that fish.

155
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,888
And who the fuck is she?

156
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,096
Desiree! Sounds like Desiree.

157
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,807
Girl, do you really want
to go back to prison?

158
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,437
You just got out, mama.

159
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,851
I told her that too.

160
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,575
He act like prison
is a bad place to go.

161
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,356
Mama, mama, you are so much better
than she is.

162
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,522
Look. My boyfriend, my husband.

163
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,892
Ok, that's fine. But he's not
with you. He's with her.

164
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,443
He left you for her
the minute you went to jail.

165
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,953
- Girl, I am so mad.
- Why don't you just stop?

166
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,988
- I don't know what else to say.
- The only thing I can say is this.

167
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,156
Get that motherfucker!

168
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,497
Oh, girl.

169
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,328
Another black boy on a board.

170
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,176
They all think
they are goddamn Lil Wayne.

171
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,882
I remember one Christmas,

172
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,877
I was like six or seven,

173
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,384
my family bought me
the cutest little Barney doll,

174
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,050
that I would take with me everywhere.

175
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,645
And one day I put it inside
the tub with me,

176
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,845
- to give it a bath.
- Oh, girl, she tried her out.

177
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,687
And it just stopped working.

178
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,897
It stopped singing the
"I love you" song.

179
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,903
And I was just so upset.

180
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,905
The world can be a cruel place.

181
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,283
Yeah, it is cruel.
God gave me a penis.

182
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,665
That's pretty damn cruel,
don't you think?

183
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,780
You speak English pretty good.

184
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,324
Where are you from?

185
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,033
I'm Armenian.

186
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,877
Yeah I knew some people,
came from Armenia.

187
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,883
Brought a lot of jewelry with them,
when they got out.

188
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,465
They lived on that jewelry,
had a restaurant.

189
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,388
What part of Armenia?

190
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,219
From the capital.

191
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,050
From Yerevan.

192
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,511
Shit.

193
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:40,148
I'm from Oklahoma,
and I am a Cherokee Indian.

194
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,610
I got... I got a girl's name, Mia.

195
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,815
But, it's a feminine name in English,
but it's not in Cherokee.

196
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,031
I was named like all
Indian Cherokee babies are named.

197
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,030
First thing the mother sees
when the baby is born

198
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,869
she names that fucking baby.

199
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,079
So when I was born,
my mama looked out the window,

200
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:03,247
and she seen a red bird,
flying overhead in the sky.

201
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,050
Cherokee Indian name
for red bird is Mia Mia.

202
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,087
So, she called me Mia.

203
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,927
If you think that's a girl's name,
it's not.

204
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,053
I'm glad she didn't look out
the window and see an outhouse.

205
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,962
Can you imagine?

206
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,228
Look, hey,
here comes "Big Shit Thompson!"

207
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,902
Right down the goddamn street.
Here he comes.

208
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,607
Oh, fuck.

209
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,064
- You OK?
- I don't know.

210
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,196
You got any aspirin?

211
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,527
- No.
- Oh, fuck.

212
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,579
- Is this Sunset Boulevard?
- Yeah.

213
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,457
You said you are going downtown,
right?

214
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,622
Yeah.

215
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,051
I'm in no hurry.

216
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,266
I'm gonna take 101, OK?

217
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,893
I don't give a shit.

218
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,855
You do what you want to do.
You're the driver.

219
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,041
Remember, Sin-Dee. No drama!

220
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,417
Yeah, no drama.

221
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,047
Hello.

222
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,514
Hey, Mila, did you see Nash?
That little negro.

223
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,723
In the back.

224
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,566
Girl. Nash!

225
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,356
Hi, Nash!
Girl, girl, it's Nash, girl!

226
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,408
What's up, Sin-Dee.
How are you doing?

227
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,326
- I haven't seen you forever.
- Yeah.

228
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,532
It's been a long time.

229
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,496
It's cool. I'm glad you're out
and everything.

230
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,579
Look at this,
business is booming today. Yes!

231
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:04,872
How can I help you?

232
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,554
I just haven't seen you
in a long time.

233
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,041
You are...
Chester.

234
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,501
I haven't seen Chester
in a long time, either.

235
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,756
Me, neither.

236
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,337
He's been hanging out
with my new friend.

237
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,673
Her name is Dani.

238
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,548
Something Dominique... Desiree...

239
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,766
No, I ain't seen her, sorry.

240
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,054
Well. Listen, Sin-Dee.
It's good seeing you, but...

241
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,889
No. no, no, no.

242
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,308
You know where the fuck she is.
So stop lying to me Nash.

243
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,646
And tell me where the fuck she is...

244
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,528
Sin-Dee, just calm down.
I ain't seen nobody.

245
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,272
This is a place for business,
I am trying to...

246
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,861
You know who the fuck
I am talking about?

247
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,367
Tell me where the fuck she is.

248
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,698
- Listen! First of all...
- OK.

249
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,949
Get some Tic-Tacs.

250
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,472
Number two, I don't know who the fuck
you are talking about.

251
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,703
This is my place of business.

252
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,467
And you are fucking my shit up
right now.

253
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,335
Oh, shut the fuck up
you lackey ass bitch!

254
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,962
- Where the fuck is she?
- I ain't telling you shit.

255
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,338
And you need to get
the fuck out of here!

256
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,875
Look, I'm not doing this!
I'm out of here. Cause you know...

257
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,885
I told you, I already told you!

258
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,045
Bye!

259
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,884
Girl! Alexandra, girl! Hold on!

260
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,720
Just one more minute...

261
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,851
Would you just go with your homeboy
and get the fuck out of here?

262
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,230
Oh, now you want to talk shit?

263
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,780
I'm not going nowhere!

264
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,458
- I don't know who...
- Where are they?

265
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,848
I don't support that pimping shit.

266
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,993
I stay on my side of the business.

267
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,250
I am morally opposed
to the pimping shit.

268
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,669
So, listen.
Don't ask me shit like that.

269
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,016
- Alright, listen, listen.
- Hello?

270
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,177
Half of the city is down at Schrader.

271
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,104
There is a food line
and they are giving away

272
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,890
$20 Christmas gift certificate.
Some shit like that, alright?

273
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,400
- Schrader!
- Food line!

274
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,185
Thank you!

275
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,900
Alright, come on, man!

276
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,064
For real?

277
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,305
Looks like you need a new pack.

278
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,508
Anybody have a lighter?
Anybody have a lighter?

279
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,389
Anybody have a fucking light?

280
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,771
Do you have a light?
Excuse me. Hey!

281
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,557
Excuse me, hello!
Do you have a light?

282
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,980
Thank you.

283
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,365
Fuck it!

284
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,892
There are girls
at the Christmas party.

285
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,062
On Olympic...
So fucking, just fucking go there.

286
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,446
Just go to... Take us to Olympic.
Mexican, he is a Mexican.

287
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,030
You know where Olympic,

288
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,151
that's south of just fucking
all the other streets.

289
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,492
You know that, right?

290
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,739
Yeah.

291
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,250
Just get us there.
Just get us there quick

292
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,457
before the other guys show up there.

293
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,040
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, man!

294
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,386
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Get out of my car, come on.

295
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,014
Come out.
Get the fuck out.

296
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,177
I'm going to Olympic and Fountain...

297
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,595
Oh! I'm burning.

298
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,179
Who is gonna clean this?

299
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,181
Who is gonna clean this?

300
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:23,061
Just relax! It's Christmas Eve!
Where is your Christmas spirit?

301
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,529
It's Christmas...
It's Christmas Eve!

302
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,497
Move!

303
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,500
You fucking animals!

304
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,642
- I wanna ride it!
- He is gonna pay for it!

305
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,098
Like a trick nigger!

306
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,059
- I wanna ride it!
- Like a trick nigger!

307
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,393
He's gonna pay for it!

308
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,682
Go in, bitch!

309
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,438
I heard his dick is little.

310
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,649
Is it little?

311
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,317
I mean, damn.

312
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,406
Wow, what the fuck is going on?

313
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,285
Going in, mommy...
Oh, my...

314
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,923
I make silicone boobs.
What do you need?

315
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,430
You don't have a baby daddy though.

316
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,373
- Bitch...
- You better go get fight, honey.

317
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,663
I was fucking your piece
the other night.

318
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,297
Tell him to run me
those diapers, bitch.

319
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,817
Don't forget my performance
at seven.

320
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,381
- Oh, yeah.
- Damn that bitch looks

321
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,640
two months pregnant.

322
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,040
How she going to come out here
looking like a shitty ass.

323
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,394
Ugly ass bitches.

324
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,805
- Is that Louie or Houie?
- She had my date, girl,

325
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,565
and he said that her tucker stink.

326
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,730
- No!
- You lying.

327
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,520
She asked for $80
and he is a $900 a date.

328
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,538
- Shut up, please.
- The bitch is stupid.

329
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,751
Dude, your cab reeks.

330
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,629
I know, I'm sorry about that.

331
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,260
We are almost there.

332
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,303
It's hardly doing anything.

333
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,235
Let me see your dick.

334
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,651
- Why?
- You already know the routine.

335
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,406
I want to make sure
you are not a cop.

336
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,070
I'm not a cop.

337
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,872
What can I do for you today?

338
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,666
- I just want to have some fun.
- What kind of fun?

339
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,041
I was thinking maybe BBBJ?

340
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,046
I can suck your dick
with a condom for 80.

341
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,888
I can give you everything I have.

342
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,478
- Forty fucking dollars?
- Oh, come on.

343
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,684
- Are you serious?
- Come on, come on.

344
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,564
My family is driving <i>me</i> fucking
crazy, I just gotta get off.

345
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,975
- That's not any of my concern.
- Okay, okay.

346
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,564
Listen. I can do all the work myself
and jerk myself off.

347
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,900
Maybe you can just grab
my balls or something.

348
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,236
Please, I will be super-fast.

349
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,446
I just, I just need...

350
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,945
- Come on, it's Christmas.
- You know what?

351
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,576
Since it is Christmas,

352
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,499
and I do need the money,

353
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,660
I'll do this.

354
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,120
But you better come fast.

355
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,038
Run me my money, put it on the dash.

356
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,673
Quickly...

357
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,897
Hey, guys. Have you seen Chester?
- Who?

358
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,064
Chester, Chester.

359
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,858
Him and his fucking whores?

360
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,944
I don't do that anymore.
Even when I see Chester,

361
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,204
- I don't want to see Chester.
- Oh, you don't do dope no more?

362
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,322
So this is the fucking silver living
line now?

363
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,832
It's not the fucking food line.

364
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,998
- You should ask Bob.
- Who the fuck is Bob?

365
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,379
The old man from the line.
He is a regular with Chester's girls.

366
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:55,382
Looks like Santa without a beard.
I've been clean for 30 days.

367
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,043
- I got my chip.
- Don't give a shit.

368
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,886
Can you just, give it
a little stroke, please?

369
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,601
Can you shut the hell up?
No, you didn't pay for that.

370
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,941
- Come on just...
- No, no. You get what you pay for.

371
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,541
- This is what you paid for.
- Come on, you know you want it.

372
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,813
You see right through me, don't you?

373
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,981
Oh, yeah.

374
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,658
Bob, Bob.
Are you Bob?

375
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,239
No? Who the fuck is Bob?

376
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,113
- Who's Bob? Who's Bob?
- I'm Bob.

377
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,284
- Come on.
- Shut the fuck up.

378
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,872
You're not even hard yet.

379
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,045
I'm fucking hard. Shut up.

380
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,498
Is that it? That's hard?

381
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,883
Fuck off, fuck this.
It's not fucking working.

382
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,215
Okay but give me...
Run me my shit.

383
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,471
Just get the fuck out.
Just get the fuck out.

384
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,797
It's not working, okay.
There is no deal.

385
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,341
I'm not going anywhere
until you give me my money.

386
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,068
What? I didn't cum.
You didn't get paid.

387
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,396
- It's all cool, just get out.
- No, no you didn't cum,

388
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,477
but because of the fact that
I had to touch your dirty ass.

389
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,900
Well, you ain't doing your job
so I couldn't cum.

390
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,903
It's enough fuckin' around.
No, I'm not going anywhere.

391
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,406
- Give me my shit.
- Get the fuck out of my car.

392
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,690
Give me my shit.

393
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,822
Get the fuck out.
OK, you know what?

394
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,361
Get the fuck...
Give me my fucking keys.

395
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,154
- Nope.
- Not fucking funny goddamn it.

396
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:08,872
Give me my fucking keys.

397
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,749
Not fucking funny.

398
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:11,955
You're not getting your fucking keys.

399
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,328
- Give me...
- You're not getting these...

400
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,894
Get off, get...
Get the fuck off me.

401
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,255
- Give me them fucking keys.
- No.

402
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,706
What...

403
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,044
You forget I got a dick, too.

404
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,553
Come here.

405
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,344
- Delee. Delila, Daphanie?
- Oh.

406
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,134
Something starting with a D.
<i>Come</i> on. D.

407
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,053
- Oh, Dana.
- I guess that's it. Where is she?

408
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,513
You know where they're at?

409
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,058
A few days ago, she was at the Grand.

410
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,442
- Off of Vermont.
- Classy!

411
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,700
- Right? Simple.
- Sure.

412
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,866
She comes back,
takes a piece of broccoli,

413
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,871
eats it and was like...
"Oh, I don't think I like this."

414
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,070
And I'm like, "You haven't even
eaten any food yet."

415
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,501
So that was the beginning of it.

416
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,664
- After lunch...
- You stay with her, okay.

417
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,878
I stay with her, we go outside.

418
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,550
Next door, to the coffee shop.

419
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,211
I get Thai iced teas.

420
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,137
And I put them down.

421
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,261
- She drinks out of my straw.
- Nice.

422
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,892
Just classy, huh?

423
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,893
- Wait a minute.
- Oh, speaking of classy.

424
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,895
- Nice, Oh, jeez.
- Oh, boy.

425
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,897
- Fucking Alexander.
- Oh, boy.

426
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,933
- Have you not worked with Alexander?
- No.

427
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,388
- Please help me.
-  Get off the car.

428
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:23,485
- Off the fucking car.
- Get off me, help.

429
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,816
Well, here is your chance,
if you want to go meet him.

430
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,951
- Nice try.
- Please help. Help me, Officer.

431
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,160
Alexandra, Alexandra.
It's enough, let him go.

432
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,328
- What's going on?
- This lady just attacked me.

433
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,786
- He owes me fucking money.
- Is it true?

434
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,337
No, I don't even know her.

435
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,664
I got out of my car
and she attacked me.

436
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,417
So a random woman just grabs you
and attacks you.

437
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,756
- Yes.
- Yes.

438
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,558
Check the pulse.

439
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,255
Alexander.

440
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,883
Girl, what the fuck?
You know I don't do that shit.

441
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,098
I don't know.
What's happening?

442
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,557
- He owes me money.
- I don't owe you money.

443
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,222
- Forty dollars.
- Forty dollars?

444
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,389
I don't even know her.

445
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,729
- Why does he owe you $40?
- He knows <i>me</i> very well.

446
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,025
Ask him.

447
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,361
Is that your green Passat?

448
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,235
Yeah.

449
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,320
Well we have seen you cruising around
for at least 45 minutes.

450
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,901
- I...
- So you didn't just park it

451
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,308
- and come down
- I just... I...

452
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,042
Like ten minutes ago
I was driving around.

453
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,114
- I was on the phone. I realized...
- I've seen it. You know what, sir?

454
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,533
I shouldn't be talking
and driving the car.

455
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,916
That's it. That's it.

456
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,873
Why does he owe you money?

457
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,754
We made a business transaction.

458
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,422
A business transaction? OK.
This is what's gonna happen.

459
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,887
It's Christmas Eve.
We'll all go our separate ways.

460
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,890
Because I think that's a lot easier
than calling our family

461
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,427
and trying to explain why we have
to be bailed out of jail.

462
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,932
What family?

463
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,296
Yeah. We know.
You posted a lot at the center.

464
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,131
Yes. At Mary's.

465
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,050
- 7:00 pm.
- 7:00.

466
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:16,218
OK. Thank you girls.
I'll see you there.

467
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,604
No, no, no.

468
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,308
- Can I help you?
- You working?

469
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,484
- Are you a cop?
- No, no. Get in.

470
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,196
Make a right,
right here on Las Palmas.

471
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,613
I like right here.

472
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,285
No. It's really busy
on the streets today, so...

473
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,271
Are you from around here?

474
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,235
No.

475
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,733
I haven't seen you before.

476
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,031
You are beautiful.

477
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,084
What about right here?

478
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,338
No. The block is hot over here.

479
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,041
There's a spot two blocks up.

480
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,426
OK. To the left right here.

481
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:31,688
So... It's so nice to see some
fresh faces out here.

482
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,815
What's your name?

483
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,030
It's whatever you want it to be.

484
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,034
- Yeah?
- What... What can I help you with?

485
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,367
You girls usually have some
exotic names.

486
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,873
Selena.

487
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,503
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

488
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,041
Where you from?

489
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,669
Does it really matter where I'm from?

490
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,512
You new? New in town?

491
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,012
I'm from Santa Clarita.

492
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,054
Can we do some French, please?
Here.

493
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,018
Cool?

494
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,067
Are these real?

495
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,321
Yeah, they're real.

496
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,486
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

497
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,580
No, no, no. no, no, no. Wait

498
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,116
I go down.

499
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,742
Pull it out. Pull it out.

500
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,453
Pull it out.

501
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,126
What's wrong?

502
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,211
What's wrong?

503
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,007
- Is it tucked?
- Is it tucked?

504
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,476
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck is this?

505
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,928
It's a pussy.

506
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,314
Get the fuck out of my car.

507
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,811
Give me my money.
Where did you put my money?

508
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,066
What the fuck is your problem, dude?

509
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,351
Get the fuck out of my car.

510
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,270
- That block you were hanging on?
- What a waste of my time.

511
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:56,689
That's not for pussies.

512
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,427
Alright? You shouldn't be there.

513
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,284
- Fucking homo, man.
- Get out of my fucking car.

514
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,443
- That's the wrong track for you.
- Fuck you, dude.

515
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,369
Don't work that track.
Close the door. Close the door!

516
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,950
Fuck you!

517
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,442
Scotty?
Scotty?

518
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,187
What number is the party room?

519
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,124
So, me and my sisters...

520
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,040
Every weekend we would go down
to this skating rink,

521
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,756
and every Friday night they
would have like a disco theme,

522
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,050
but you would have to bring,
like, a guy...

523
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,809
And could never find a guy
to go with me,

524
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,591
so I had to dance with my sisters.

525
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,153
Hold on.

526
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah?

527
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,877
Chester has any girls here?

528
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,212
Maybe.
And who are you?

529
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,738
Does Chester have any girls here?

530
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,879
- Who the fuck are you?
- Dana?

531
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,886
- I'm not Dana
- No, no, no. I'm looking for Dana.

532
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,675
There ain't no Dana here.

533
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,093
Dinah?

534
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,722
Oh, shit!

535
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:57,477
What the fuck are you doing?
Get the fuck out!

536
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,186
- Where's fucking Dinah?
- Who cares?

537
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,153
- Get the fuck out.
- Where the fuck is Dinah?

538
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,610
Where she at, girl?

539
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,649
She's in there.
But you're not going in there.

540
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,031
- Watch me, bitch!
- Get the fuck out!

541
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,118
- Dinah! Dinah!
- Get the fuck out of here!

542
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,116
That's where she's at!
She's fucking blonde!

543
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,868
- Where's she at?
- Get the fuck out.

544
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,878
She's in the bathroom!
I'm sorry, guys!

545
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,414
Dinah? Dinah?

546
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,877
Fucking Dinah!

547
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,212
Right here! In there!

548
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,052
What? Hey! Hey!

549
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,898
Who are you?

550
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,642
What do you want?

551
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,536
Oh, my God.

552
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:57,332
Guys, shut the fuck up! Shut up!

553
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,879
We have neighbors, alright?

554
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,291
- I'm not getting kicked out.
- Is that crazy bitch coming back?

555
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,210
She's not coming back.
That's what I'm telling you.

556
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,594
She's not coming back.

557
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,381
Girls, go! Go back in the other room!
Go! Go!

558
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,828
I better get
a freebie next time!

559
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,725
No! You're not getting a freebie,
alright?

560
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,428
Did you want me to call the cops?

561
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,267
Yeah, genius.

562
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,670
Let's get the whole precinct
down here, you motherfucker!

563
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,817
You have the wrong person!

564
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:30,865
What's your name?

565
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,028
Dinah!

566
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,947
Dinah, Dinah, Dinah, Dinah!

567
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,883
Razmik!

568
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,139
Hey! Alexandra, come here!

569
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,514
I'm so fucking happy
to see you today.

570
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:57,346
Oh, my God. You will not believe
what I have been through!

571
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,140
What happened? Get in.

572
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,062
What a sight for sore eyes!

573
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,152
Thanks for helping, you motherfucker!

574
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,953
- Hurry up! Come on!
- Ow!

575
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,122
This is like the second time

576
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:17,596
this month that this happened to me.

577
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,168
I'm tired of being fucking nice
to people.

578
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,128
I've got some money for you.
Don't worry, man.

579
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,674
I think this is becoming
our favorite spot.

580
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:30,879
Yeah.

581
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,054
- Hi.
- Just the wash.

582
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,011
I don't know what's going on
with your man,

583
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,051
but it has nothing to do with me!

584
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,890
Who are you talking about?

585
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,054
Fucking name?
You want a fucking name?

586
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,723
How about a fucking name?

587
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,392
You know what you're going
to get from me?

588
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,695
Me, you and him are gonna have
a little sit down, a little chit-chat

589
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:52,900
about what's really fucking going on.

590
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,234
Who the fuck is him?

591
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,900
I got eight dates a day!
Just tell me...

592
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:08,836
Merry Christmas.

593
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,507
You didn't have to do this.

594
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,792
Yes, I did.

595
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,049
What's that?

596
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,888
My performance.
It's going to be at 7:00.

597
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,930
All of my favorite people
are going to be there.

598
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,146
Miss Sin-Dee. And Miss Dani...

599
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,895
Wait. Wait. Sin-Dee? Which Sin-Dee?

600
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,604
Sin-Dee Rella.

601
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:32,007
Looks like someone has a crush.

602
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,528
Sin-Dee's back on the block?

603
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:37,031
Oh, yeah. She's back.
She's back and she's going hard.

604
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,614
- Come here!
- Fuck you!

605
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,657
See you later on tonight.
I have to go.

606
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,201
- Bye.
- OK. Take care.

607
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,880
Say you're not gonna run away
on me again!

608
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,559
Not gonna run away.

609
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,669
All right. We're in agreement.

610
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,179
Bring your fucking ass.

611
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,822
She's getting skinnier and skinnier.

612
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,208
Everyone comes to America
and gets fat.

613
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,619
Even I gained weight.

614
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,041
But this girl gets skinnier.

615
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,795
I don't gain or lose.

616
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,386
You always weigh the same.

617
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,886
Mom, I'm sorry.
I spilled a little bit.

618
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,058
Where are the fruits? Fruits.

619
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,311
Coming right up.

620
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,690
She loves that dog.

621
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,523
She loves that dog very much.

622
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,813
I don't like dogs.

623
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,069
Maybe I'll get used to it.

624
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,826
Everything requires getting used to.

625
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,161
You'll get used to
a lot more than that.

626
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,585
Again you want to smoke?

627
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,086
Eat something.
Please help yourself.

628
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,093
How are you, Razmik?

629
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,848
Good. How are you?

630
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,259
Good. Thank God.

631
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,018
How is Ashot?

632
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,770
Good. He's growing old... With me.

633
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,473
Any business out there today?

634
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,254
Let her grow up a little
and then Yeva can start working also.

635
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:49,740
Well, I came here to help
with the child so they can work.

636
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,204
That's the right thing to do.

637
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,877
That's what grandmothers are for.

638
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:59,800
So they can help take care
of my sweetie pie.

639
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,711
Ashken, she looks like you.

640
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,593
No, she looks more like Razmik.

641
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,424
Especially her smile.

642
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,051
Come here, sweetie.

643
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,057
Come and sit with Daddy.

644
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,892
Come on!

645
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,521
Shut the fuck up!
What are you crying for?

646
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:22,985
Shut the fuck up!

647
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,859
Get your fucking ass in here!

648
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,987
Hello! Where is he at?
Where's your fucking friend?

649
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,951
Is this the person you
were talking about?

650
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,032
You need to help me!
Call Chester!

651
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,618
You gotta call Chester!

652
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:35,876
What have you done to her?

653
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,662
Yeah, Chester! Where's Chester?

654
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,509
Chester's not gonna be cool
with this shit!

655
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,540
You know Chester?

656
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,879
Yes, I know Chester!

657
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,133
Why me? What did I do?

658
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,044
You gotta get her
the fuck out of here!

659
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,468
Shut the fuck up! Where's Chester?

660
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,098
I'm not leaving unless
you tell me where he is...

661
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,884
Calm down!
He's at Donut Time!

662
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,057
At Donut Time! Great!

663
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,103
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

664
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,605
Alright. When you see him,

665
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,108
could you kinda not tell him
that I'm the one

666
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:02,066
that kinda told you
that he was there?

667
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,781
Time to make the donuts, bitch.

668
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,454
Fuck up!

669
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:24,133
You know what?
I want to see Chester right now!

670
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,880
I can't wait to see
that motherfucker!

671
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,887
He doesn't like you.
You aren't special.

672
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:29,635
I know I ain't special,

673
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,958
but I'm his bottom bitch
for the last two weeks, bitch!

674
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,677
And when he finds out what the hell
you been doing to me,

675
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:37,438
I swear to God, he's going to rip
that cheap ass wig off your head

676
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,312
and shove it up your
fucking gaping asshole!

677
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,121
You might be his bottom bitch,
but I'm his girlfriend,

678
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,581
you fucking whore!

679
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,666
Oh, my fucking God!

680
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,465
You're Chester's girlfriend?
Is that what you fucking think?

681
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:08,970
Chester's got a lot
of motherfucking girlfriends

682
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,648
and you are definitely not
one of them!

683
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,831
What the fuck do I look like?

684
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,921
Like y'all niggas are going
to Red Lobster and shit!

685
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,677
Oh, this my boyfriend!

686
00:43:16,052 --> 00:43:18,054
You are so mad pathetic right now!

687
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,057
You're like home like waiting
for him to call and shit.

688
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,101
That's sad.
That's fucking sad.

689
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,277
I'm getting dragged around
this fucking city is not as sad

690
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,649
as you sitting home thinking your
Chester's motherfucking girlfriend!

691
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,991
I'mma perform. Don't worry.

692
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,540
It's gonna blow your fucking mind.

693
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,130
Getting my fucking hair thing.
Is that OK with you?

694
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,885
Girlfriend.

695
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,676
Shit. Fucking pathetic.

696
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,473
Girlfriend.

697
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,889
What time is it?
What fucking time is it?

698
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,603
What time is it?

699
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,484
Fuck!

700
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:18,031
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

701
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,875
I'm gonna put Kool-Aid on.
That's gonna be it.

702
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,708
She goes on forever.
You know she goes on forever.

703
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,222
We're at Donut Time, fucking retard!

704
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,345
We've got something else to do first.

705
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,060
- They'll be here.
- Your fans are not here.

706
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,017
Alright, Miss Crawford?

707
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,683
You're going with me.
You've got no fucking choice, OK?

708
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,351
Is it a double date with Chester?

709
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,235
'Cause I would really
fucking love that.

710
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,492
Come on, we're buddies now.
We're buddies. We suck the same cock.

711
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,454
How much you cost?
How much can I buy you for, huh?

712
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,877
How much you take me out for
out there?

713
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,289
Look at your nasty clothes.
You couldn't afford it.

714
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,877
My nasty clothes?

715
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,337
What's this? Tricks 'R Us?

716
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,048
Listen, sweetheart, I'm bumping you.

717
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,213
Next year, OK?

718
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,049
Come on. Move your ass.

719
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:24,056
Ali, girl! Alexandra, girl!
I'm here, girl!

720
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,275
I'm tired, let's go! I didn't think
I was gonna make it here on time!

721
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,894
What the fuck is this?

722
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,156
Girl, how late am I? I'm thinking
I'm five minutes late, right?

723
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,570
What did you do to her?

724
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,031
Don't worry about her.
You gotta go on stage. Come on!

725
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,203
OK.

726
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,036
Look. My friends are here.

727
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,044
<i>Come</i> on. Just come on.

728
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:51,875
How you doing?

729
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,293
This one has one shoe!

730
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,837
She's from the hills. She hillbilly.
Come on, girl!

731
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,756
Merry Christmas.

732
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,392
Good to see you.

733
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,935
Come here, baby.

734
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,600
Has she eaten?

735
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:13,021
She doesn't eat this kind of food.
I will feed her later.

736
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,610
Let's toast to the head
of this household.

737
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,240
All the best to you and your family.

738
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,417
Thank you. Wishing you the same.

739
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,995
To your health.

740
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,630
Ashken, you have a great son-in-law.

741
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,921
He's great
but he gets tired too much.

742
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,301
I don't know what the fuck
I'm gonna do with this hair.

743
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,717
It's super straight
like those fucking Asian hos.

744
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,392
Is that how you like it?

745
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,725
Yeah. Sometimes.
But not all the time.

746
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,605
It don't have to always be like that.
Let me do this.

747
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:52,189
Yeah. Fix your face. Fix that mug.
That's what everybody is looking at.

748
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,945
- I need to get these eyebrows done.
- Yes, you do.

749
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,242
You know...
Why did you bring her here?

750
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,036
Fuck her.
We ain't worried about her.

751
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,867
She ain't nobody.
Today's about you.

752
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,550
Why you so up on her anyways?
With that fucked up face of yours.

753
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,874
Look at her!

754
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:10,036
You didn't have to Chris Brown
the bitch!

755
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,043
I told you what I had to do
today. You act like I was playing.

756
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,333
You know when I say shit,
I mean it, girl.

757
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,544
You wanna go onstage
looking like this?

758
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,047
What, exactly, are you implying?

759
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:25,059
I imply that you use some of my eye.
And let me do what I need to do.

760
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,493
Do you want my help or not?

761
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,275
Your highlight's
all fucked off, girl.

762
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,893
You need to learn how to blend.

763
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,064
Your chestnuts are roasting on
the bottom of your chinny-chin-chin.

764
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,942
What exactly
are you doing to my face?

765
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,867
Trying to make you look
better than what you looked like before.

766
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,444
You tried it.

767
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,200
Yo.

768
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,828
- I'm just... I'm so over it.
- Yo!

769
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,207
I don't even know what to do.

770
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,752
- Yo!
- Bitch, what the fuck you want?

771
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,593
Finish your own make-up.
You know how I taught you:

772
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,429
Highlight, highlight, highlight,
contour.

773
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,059
Blush, blemish, bomb, barn!

774
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,095
Just stay over there.
I don't want to smell that shit!

775
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,822
I'm trying to enjoy it in peace,
please.

776
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,348
I had a stressful day today.

777
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,900
Come on! Yo. That's my shit.

778
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,060
It's my pipe.

779
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:20,773
I can feel it.

780
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,867
Oh, girl, hit her. Hit her.

781
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,118
She's smoking' up.

782
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,780
You gonna bring this bitch here,
and now you smoking this shit!

783
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,635
Where the fuck
is the red lip gloss?

784
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,845
Girl, you seen it. I know you did.

785
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,224
That's for real...

786
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,476
Chester took it.

787
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,353
Took it like a champ.

788
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,563
Let me tell you,

If you trying to upset me

790
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,608
I give zero fucks about you
and Chester.

791
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,904
Oh, bra! He was all he could be
when he joined my Navy!

792
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,530
Does your friend ever shut up?

793
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,026
No. That bitch been talking
ever since I met her.

Girl, that's right.
She did that. Yes! She did that.

00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,973
This next one
is one of my favorites.

I hope it's one of yours.

00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,018
Shit. I need some more
of that shit, girl.

826
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,349
Yeah, let's go.

827
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,194
I'm going to go to work.

828
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:26,564
Now?

829
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,401
Yes, I didn't earn a penny today.

830
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,735
But we're eating.

831
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,276
- So what?
- It's Christmas Eve.

832
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,781
So what?

833
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,365
I have no patience for her.
Make sure she doesn't make a fuss.

834
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,161
I'll take care of it.

835
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,038
Forgive me, but I have to go to work.

836
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,646
What do you mean you have to leave?

837
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,425
You just got home.

838
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:54,096
I haven't made a penny today.
I'm going to work for a few hours.

839
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:57,049
It's Christmas and I have guests.

840
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:58,183
It's okay, Mom.

841
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,639
It's okay.
You don't have to make money today.

842
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:00,849
It's Christmas.

843
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,012
What do you mean?

844
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,476
If I don't make money,
how do <i>we</i> live?

845
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,482
- It's okay, Mom.
- It's Christmas Eve.

846
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,570
Christmas is for Americans.
For us, it's another work day.

847
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:10,896
You live in America now.

848
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,778
Can you please tell her
to close her mouth, please?

849
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,100
I'm not in the mood for this.

850
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,197
What did he say?

851
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,533
Yeva, what did he say?

852
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,956
He said he must go.

853
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,500
He speaks English
but he doesn't celebrate Christmas.

854
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,037
He should have stayed home tonight.

855
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,507
I know but his real Christmas
is on the 6th.

856
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,376
Today isn't his real Christmas.

857
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,715
He was the only man at the table.

858
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,282
He was pouring us cognac.
Now we have to pour it ourselves.

859
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,892
Mom, he's the only one working
and supporting this household.

860
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:43,513
Let's not let this ruin our night.

861
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,865
Hey! It's that guy!

862
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,292
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.

863
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:30,869
Okay.

864
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,927
You did good, girl.
You sound good tonight, girl.

865
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,345
She sound good, right?
She sound good, girl.

866
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,683
Tell her she sound good.

867
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,725
I mean...
you did sing and you sang...

868
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,810
Alright, I'm going to keep it real
with you right now.

869
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:57,150
This is not critical,
this is not anything like rude,

870
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,231
this is just being real with you...

871
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:04,403
Honestly, it sounded a little old.
Like, it didn't sound like new music.

872
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,080
It sounded like something I'd hear
like a long time ago,

873
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:08,616
know what I'm saying?
It's like...

874
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,329
Like I know...
Where I'm coming from is

875
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,244
I know a lot
about the music industry.

876
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:13,833
I know a lot of people
in the music industry.

877
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,088
I myself sing.

878
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,140
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

879
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,887
Do you know if this
is still going on?

880
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,054
Oh, look at this. That's cute.
No, she's gone.

881
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,983
She was up. She was on. She's done.

882
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:37,395
She left.

883
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,529
She was with a friend
and her name is Sin-Dee.

884
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:41,690
Oh, the train wreck
and the hot mess. Yeah.

885
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,196
They left?

886
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,528
What do you mean they left?
Yeah, they're gone.

887
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,407
The cool thing is though, I mean,
look, you played in a club...

888
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,293
you got people paying you
to play in a club.

889
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,913
I mean, that's pretty cool.

890
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,209
What?

891
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,040
You don't want to talk about
how much you got?

892
00:56:58,206 --> 00:56:59,628
She don't want to tell me
how much she got paid.

893
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,793
- How much did you get paid?
- Girl, she didn't get paid, girl.

894
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,762
- She paid to sing, girl.
- What do you mean?

895
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,222
I don't even understand
what you talking about.

896
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,677
I can hear you.

897
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:13,063
You paid... Wait.
You paid them to let you sing?

898
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,933
That's... That's sad. Hold up.

899
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,314
So you gave them 20 bucks and said,
"Let me sing a Christmas song?"

900
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,040
Girl, stop, it's not like you could
do any better anyway, girl.

901
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,865
Mother, I'm not discussing this.

902
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:31,282
I'm your mother.
If I don't talk about it, who will?

903
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,416
Mother, stop.

904
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,579
I'm not cleaning up.
I'm going to bed.

905
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,555
Come on.
Come on, girl. We're here.

906
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,932
Hey, look who's back.
Hi, baby.

907
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:55,097
- I don't have time for this shit.
- Don't be a bitch about it.

908
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,607
Yeah, you're cute.
I love your sweater, your fake purse.

909
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:00,903
What is wrong with you?
Are you on something?

910
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,063
Yes. I'm on. I'm gonna kick
your fucking ass

911
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,818
if you talk to me again.

912
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:08,657
She's been out of jail for
24 hours, she's already causing drama.

913
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,412
Drama!

914
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,834
You two, stay your asses here
until I come get you.

915
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,912
Alexandra, you better watch her,
and don't move your black ass.

916
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,025
Girl, where you been?

917
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:45,568
Chester.

918
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,581
I thought they let your ass out
at noon.

919
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,034
Where you been all day?

920
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,044
What?
Sin-Sin, sit your ass down.

921
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:08,467
You know, you could have
at least had the decency

922
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,050
to come pick me up.

923
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,425
Who the fuck am I gonna get
to come pick you up?

924
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,435
You know,
I got Nash working on Vermont.

925
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,145
I got Ty on the West Side, right?

926
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,473
I mean I be running around
taking care of business and shit,

927
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,142
doing what I do all day.
You <i>know,</i> running this shit.

928
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,019
And then, fuckin', it's...

929
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:26,359
On top of that
it's motherfucking Christmas Eve.

930
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,613
You know how these
motherfuckers get...

931
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,655
They like, fucking wanna get their
last minute shopping in and shit.

932
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:41,037
I had two dollars. Two dollars.
You know what I spent it on?

933
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,673
- What?
- The bus and a donut.

934
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:49,427
Sin-Sin. Sit your ass down.

935
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,841
It don't matter, we here now.
Sit down.

936
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,853
Did you at least get me
a Christmas present?

937
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,856
Well, I mean, like, like yeah...

938
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:08,067
Like I get... our gift is like me
fucking running shit,

939
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,525
like saving money, like, 'cause
I knew you was getting out today.

940
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:14,115
I was gonna surprise you.

941
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,839
Was gonna take you
to Roscoe's tomorrow

942
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:19,579
for maybe like a fucking, like,
a nice Christmas dinner and shit.

943
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,209
Like, I thought that'd be special.

944
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,421
What?

945
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,876
You know, I feel you.
But I got you one.

946
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,470
I think you're gonna like it.

947
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,172
And I'm gonna get it for you
right now. Hold on...

948
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,541
Where the fuck are you going?

949
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,682
Oh, what the fuck is this shit?

950
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,979
- Fuck her! Fuck her now! Fuck her!
- Come on, man.

951
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,894
You wanna fuck her
in front of everybody, right?

952
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:53,242
Fuck her, come on! Fuck her!
This is what you want?

953
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,492
Alright, alright, alright!

954
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,891
Twenty eight motherfucking days

955
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:57,321
and you're out here
cheating on me with fish?

956
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,452
- I did not cheat on you.
- You're a fucking liar!

957
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,786
- Alright!
- Everybody on the goddamn block

958
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:04,461
- knew about it but me.
- Hey! I'm gonna call the cop!

959
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,624
You want me to call the cop?

960
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,150
Mamasan, I'm sorry. I'm gonna chill
these motherfuckers out.

961
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:16,972
- Hi.
- Hi.

962
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,058
Are you Armenian?

963
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,845
Yeah.

964
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,226
- What's your name, son?
- Karo.

965
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:26,267
Karo, do you know Razmik?

966
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,101
Which Razmik?

967
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,272
Razmik Simonian.
He is one of your drivers.

968
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,026
Yes. Of course.
I know him very well.

969
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:36,826
I need you to take me to him
right away. Please.

970
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,238
Where do you think he might be?

971
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,369
I am his mother-in-law.

972
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:48,546
Oh. He should be around
the West Hollywood area.

973
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,628
I will find him for you.

974
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,466
Razmik? Razmik?
Where is your location?

975
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,400
Razmik is not working tonight.

976
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:04,179
I knew it.
I told her he is not going to work.

977
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,064
What is the matter, Auntie?

978
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,060
How well do you know my son-in-law?

979
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,062
Mom?

980
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,947
We will find him but we may drive
all night. Okay?

981
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,123
Yes, drive. It's okay.

982
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:32,420
This thing busts in
and drags me out by my hair,

983
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,834
tries to beat my <i>ass,</i>

984
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,040
then she took me to some
boring-ass drag queen show.

985
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:37,296
I ain't no motherfucking drag queen!

986
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,260
I'm losing sympathy for you
by the minute.

987
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,049
Hold up.
This motherfucking commotion,

988
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,976
this is all that shit
at The Grand was about?

989
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,852
- This bullshit right here?
- Merry Christmas.

990
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:47,605
- Yo, I thought that was a bust.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

991
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,308
Hold up, listen.

992
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,227
I don't give no kinds of shit
about this bitch, alright, alright?

993
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,855
But please, please tell me
you didn't lay a hand on Jillian?

994
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,357
Please tell me you didn't
go crazy on her?

995
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,612
Why would I lay a hand on Jillian?
It's not like your fucking Jillian...

996
01:02:58,775 --> 01:02:59,947
You're fucking Jillian too,
aren't you?

997
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,111
Alright!
Listen, hold on.

998
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,370
I'm gonna have
to fuck her up now too!

999
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,531
Calm down. There's been some sort
of misunderstanding here, alright?

1000
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,867
Who's name you see tattooed here?
Huh?

1001
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,035
What's that say?
What's that name say?

1002
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,722
What's that name say?
That's your name.

1003
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,668
Hey, Mamasan!
Come here and read this motherfucker.

1004
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:13,878
What's this say?

1005
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,542
You know, you piss me the fuck off
sometimes, Chester!

1006
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,876
Hey, what's this say?

1007
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,883
This motherfucker
don't say Dana, does it?

1008
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,343
It's Dinah!

1009
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,804
Alright, I don't give a fuck what
her motherfucking name is, alright,

1010
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:28,014
but Boo... you have got to get
ahold of yourself, okay?

1011
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,305
You be tripping.

1012
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,438
Alright? Hey look at me, look...
Who's your man?

1013
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,111
Who's heart beats for you?
This heart.

1014
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,322
Who's your man?
I'm your motherfucking fiancé

1015
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,866
and you can't be acting
this motherfucking crazy.

1016
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,822
Did you just say fiancé?

1017
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:43,507
- What?
- You two are getting married?

1018
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:45,865
You just went from half fag
to full fag!

1019
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:47,578
- Alright...
- Get your life!

1020
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:49,584
Shut the fuck up. Come here.
Shut the fuck up.

1021
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,666
Shut the fuck up.
Shut up.

1022
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,796
They said you was legit,
they didn't say you was a legit homo.

1023
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,214
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

1024
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:56,758
You talk when I tell you
to motherfucking talk.

1025
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,884
Did he just say
you were getting married?

1026
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:01,888
Yes, I proposed right before
she got herself arrested.

1027
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,207
Before I got myself arrested?

1028
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:04,550
Actually you got me arrested
when you asked me

1029
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:06,184
to hold your teener in my weave.

1030
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,016
You're like, 'Oh, Sin-Dee, the cops
are coming,

1031
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,851
- why don't you hold my teener..."
- Are you fucking serious?

1032
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,230
"I'll propose to you,
we'll get married.

1033
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,436
It'll be a pretty thing!"

1034
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,897
Listen, listen, listen. I can't be
getting popped on that shit,

1035
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,420
for you it's just holding,
for me it's intent to distribute.

1036
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,109
Oh, my God, that is not the T.

1037
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,366
This right here,
is this what you fucking want?

1038
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,924
Okay, okay, okay. Listen, listen.
You gotta lower your voice,

1039
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,867
they are gonna kick our
fucking stupid asses out of here.

1040
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:27,702
Mamasan, I'm sorry, I'm gonna chill
these motherfuckers out.

1041
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,249
- Stop yelling!
- Okay.

1042
01:04:29,407 --> 01:04:30,750
This is a business!

1043
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,248
Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna buy
some donuts. Alright.

1044
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,830
I'm gonna buy some donuts,

1045
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:39,877
and then the three of us
are gonna fuckin' chill. Chill.

1046
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:42,754
This weather in LA

1047
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,257
Doesn't help
to set the holiday mood.

1048
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:47,760
There's no Christmas without snow.

1049
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:51,138
Christmas is Christmas
regardless of the weather.

1050
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:55,021
Feels fake.

1051
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,899
Los Angeles
is a beautifully wrapped lie.

1052
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,238
Agree to disagree.

1053
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,701
I'm learning English.

1054
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,458
- Mamasan, I like your hair.
- Alright.

1055
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,588
What do you want? Hurry up.

1056
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,947
Do you have watermelon flavor?

1057
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,379
No.

1058
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,135
Don't you think we should be
getting the Christmas donuts?

1059
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,461
I mean it's motherfucking
Christmas Eve.

1060
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,967
Like, let's celebrate.

1061
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,266
Mamasan, does your husband
ever cheat on you?

1062
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,098
- Who's gonna marry her smiling ass?
- The one who order her offline.

1063
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,389
- Look how happy she is.
- Hurry up, I have another costumer.

1064
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:34,727
- OK.
- What do you want?

1065
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,904
Can you come here a second?
Just one second.

1066
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:51,868
- Hey, baby. how's it going'?
- Hey. How are ya?

1067
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,791
I'm wonderful.
Are you ready for me?

1068
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,873
Listen, have you seen
Sin-Dee tonight?

1069
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:59,084
Yeah, I've seen her, baby,
she's involved in some drama,

1070
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,794
but I'm right here.

1071
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:03,522
No, no, I really need to find her,
do you know where she's at?

1072
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,212
Yeah. I know.

1073
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,297
And?

1074
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,466
And I know I need a cheeseburger.

1075
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,143
Jesus fucking Christ.

1076
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,064
Here, this is your cheeseburger.

1077
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,568
And some French fries.

1078
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,730
Where is she?

1079
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,781
Give me that money back.

1080
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,789
Here, I'm gonna give you this.
Where is she?

1081
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,364
She's at Donut Time.

1082
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,997
- Big spender.
- Go fuck yourself.

1083
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,005
At the Long Beach Barbeque Festival,

1084
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,882
you said I was the only girl
you ever truly loved.

1085
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,042
That's true.

1086
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:47,341
You know, people who love people,

1087
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,426
don't go fucking other people,
Chester.

1088
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,683
Shit, I did not motherfucking
cheat on you.

1089
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,139
I'm a businessman, alright?
I move product.

1090
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:57,272
That's what I do. Alright, sometimes
I gotta test the merch is all.

1091
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,182
- How many times did he fuck you?
- Don't answer that.

1092
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,772
- How many times?
- He fucked me plenty, okay?

1093
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,858
- How many?
- What is fucking wrong with you?

1094
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:07,945
Ten? Like, I never had a pimp
who didn't fuck me.

1095
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,451
So you had to check
your merchandise ten times, Chester?

1096
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:13,155
Alright, listen.
Not another word from you.

1097
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,442
You shut your fucking mouth.

1098
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,334
Twenty eight days
and you mean to tell me

1099
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,419
nobody was taking care of you?
Nobody?

1100
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:24,753
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

1101
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:25,917
Nope.

1102
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:29,963
Auntie, are you sure you want
to keep looking?

1103
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,798
What was your name again?

1104
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,217
Karo.

1105
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:40,608
Karo, please don't waste my time.
Take me to Razmik.

1106
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:44,853
Chester, I was at Twin Towers,
not fucking Wasco State Prison.

1107
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,943
You really do have a crush,
don't you?

1108
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:49,107
Hi, Rizuku!

1109
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,567
Okay, I will take you

1110
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,694
to your son-in-law.
But do you know why?

1111
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,154
Because he has to understand that
even if he does not respect himself...

1112
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,074
...he must respect his family.

1113
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,077
Shit floats to the surface.

1114
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,586
Sit your ass fucking down.
No, no, man.

1115
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,421
She ain't fucking available.

1116
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:09,504
She with me right now.
She ain't fucking working.

1117
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:11,024
We'll be real quick, just 15 minutes.

1118
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:13,052
Yeah, puppy. Just 15 minutes.

1119
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:15,967
Who are you?

1120
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:18,978
Nigga, who the fuck are you?
I'm her motherfucking fiancé.

1121
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:20,184
Bounce, motherfucker!

1122
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,724
You retired?
I didn't know you retired.

1123
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,900
- Yes, she fucking retired.
- Why didn't you tell me you retired?

1124
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,982
Maybe I am available.
Maybe it'll be a freebie.

1125
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,405
- My cheating fiancé shouldn't mind.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1126
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:33,076
Have you ever been to Santa Monica
and Highland?

1127
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:35,153
Oh, I don't remember.

1128
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:36,867
You will remember.

1129
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,957
Yo, yo, yo, listen. I got a query.
You married, right?

1130
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,877
Nigga, you got a fucking wife.
I know you do.

1131
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,336
Yeah.

1132
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,089
Yeah.
So, when you be fucking my bitches,

1133
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,042
you don't consider it cheating,
do you?

1134
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,552
I'm paying for it.
It's not like we're getting married.

1135
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,588
Oh, you see?
That's the shit right there.

1136
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,884
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You didn't pay for it, Chester!

1137
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,427
He's lucky he's in America.

1138
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,304
Imagine if he was in Armenia.

1139
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,104
Are you available?

1140
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:06,984
I don't think she gets
what you want, Ra-Ra.

1141
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,623
Nigga, come here. Let me talk to you.

1142
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,397
There's his cab. Should I stop here?

1143
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,152
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1144
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,862
Stop right here.

1145
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,275
Cause I'm
feeling fucking generous,

1146
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,676
I have motherfucking holiday spirit

1147
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,696
alright, nigga,
I'm gonna get you Pinkberry.

1148
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,658
You ever hear of Pinkberry?
Oh, man, trust me.

1149
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,208
You know what? It's okay.

1150
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:27,793
I don't need money.

1151
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:30,240
Merry motherfucking Christmas,
you know what I'm saying?

1152
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,425
Merry Christmas.

1153
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,177
Happy New Year.

1154
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:40,893
Razmik!

1155
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:42,395
That is a cute-ass blouse.

1156
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,897
What are you doing here?

1157
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:46,729
What are you doing here?

1158
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,106
- I don't understand.
- You said you were going to work.

1159
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,236
I am at work. I'm getting coffee.

1160
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:52,859
Girl, she shopped
at the same store you shopped at!

1161
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:55,317
Did Yeva bring you here?
Is she here?

1162
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:56,617
No, Yeva did not.
Karo brought me here.

1163
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:57,823
But she wore it better, bitch!

1164
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,450
Nobody asked you,
bitch.

1165
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,786
I'm not going anywhere
until I get an explanation.

1166
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,826
Who are these people?

1167
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:08,713
These are just regular people.
Come on, let's go home.

1168
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:09,922
I said I'm not going to go anywhere.

1169
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:11,754
Now you got her
talking to him in Chinese!

1170
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,922
This is funny!

1171
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:16,679
Oh, I see... you are smoking
marijuana with these people.

1172
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,802
Oh, my God,
what are you talking about?

1173
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,467
If she's talking about me,
I'll fuck her up.

1174
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,011
She thinks I'm doing drugs. Can you
please tell her I don't do drugs?

1175
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,646
- No, he don't do my drugs.
- You see?

1176
01:10:25,847 --> 01:10:27,847
He just fuck all these bitches.
He fuck my bitches.

1177
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,110
- Are you crazy?
- Prostitution?

1178
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:32,770
No!

1179
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,860
How do you say that shit in Russian?
Oh... prostituke!

1180
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,319
You have to stop starting shit.

1181
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:39,239
Oh, these are prostitutes.
These are prostitutes.

1182
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,120
She called me a nick niggy, girl!

1183
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,032
Ashken, let me explain.

1184
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:46,997
Oh, my God... these are men.

1185
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:50,254
Oh, my God... these are men.

1186
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,461
- Wait till you find out about...
- Will you stop over there!

1187
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:53,840
Oh, dear Lord,
my heart is going to stop.

1188
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,001
Will you stop?

1189
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:58,138
I'm going to have a heart attack.

1190
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,135
I can't have your wife
dying up in here.

1191
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,807
Shit, she dying. yo!

1192
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:03,843
You gotta tell her I don't know you.
This is my mother-in-law.

1193
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,183
Motherfucker, I don't know you.
I don't know that bitch either!

1194
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,517
Mister Chester!

1195
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,893
Hold on! She calling the police!

1196
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,278
Yeva, come to the corner
of Santa Monica

1197
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:15,563
and Highland.
Donut shop.

1198
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,528
She's calling the police!
Your name is Tyrone and I'm Billy!

1199
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,067
They ain't never gonna find us!

1200
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,074
Your husband is with gay prostitutes.

1201
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,872
Corner of Santa Monica and Highland.

1202
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,878
Tell that bitch do not call the cops!

1203
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,540
Done! Done!

1204
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,337
See what you did?

1205
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:55,062
Oh, shit. Who's shit is this?
This isn't mine, this is good.

1206
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:58,823
Ashken, listen to me. Let's go home.

1207
01:11:58,981 --> 01:11:59,982
Don't touch me.

1208
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,072
What do you mean "don't touch me"?
Why did you come here?

1209
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,953
Hey, there is no fighting in here.

1210
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:06,580
- C'mon, get up.
- Don't touch me.

1211
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,286
He hurting you?
I can call the police if he...

1212
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:09,826
No, no, no.
I'm not hurting her.

1213
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,193
This is my mother-in-law.
She's just a little bit crazy.

1214
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:13,333
No cops, please.

1215
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,498
- Did you hear what she said?
- Razmik!

1216
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,960
"Oh, how was the performance,
Alexandra?"

1217
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,846
"Oh, it was great.
Thanks for asking."

1218
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,184
You think the government doesn't know
about aliens and spaceships and shit?

1219
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,895
You think they not keeping it
a secret from us?

1220
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:40,448
- Exactly. That's cool.
- That's right. I'm with this bitch.

1221
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,534
- I know you're with that bitch.
- Not like that.

1222
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,528
You are embarrassing me.

1223
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,409
No, you are embarrassing us.

1224
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:48,414
C'mon, get up.

1225
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,497
What do you want from us?
Don't you feel sorry for my daughter?

1226
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,661
So did Mr. Falafel have a big dick?

1227
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,539
What? Spit it out.

1228
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:58,416
I didn't. I swallowed it.

1229
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:01,427
I know... I...
I fucking set that one up, didn't I?

1230
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:02,867
She's going to call the police.

1231
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,891
In front of all these people,
I'm going to rip your mask off.

1232
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,718
Listen to me. Get up. Let's go.

1233
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,182
I'm going to find out
what you are doing here.

1234
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,107
Razmik?

1235
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,367
Are you people totally insane?
Why did you bring the baby here?

1236
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:27,905
Mom, what's going on here?

1237
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,240
Your husband is a dog. Dog.

1238
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,828
Mom, what's going on with you?

1239
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:35,962
You think I don't know?
I check your bank statements...

1240
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,122
Every night he withdraws cash
from your account...

1241
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,502
What does he spend it on? Them.

1242
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,963
This is embarrassing. Please.
Let's go home.

1243
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,802
Mom, why are you getting involved
in my family's affairs?

1244
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,338
It's none of your business.

1245
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:49,346
You can pretend to be blind
but I cannot.

1246
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,184
Get up. We're going home.

1247
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,305
I'm not going to allow him
to get away with this.

1248
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,522
- You see that? You see that?
- Sin-Dee, leave them alone.

1249
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:56,773
Help me out, sister...

1250
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:01,146
When your husband goes out
and buys a girl like me,

1251
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:02,859
do you consider that cheating?

1252
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:04,399
Sin-Dee, can you please
not talk to my wife.

1253
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:05,904
- Sin-Dee, please...
- Get your hands off her.

1254
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,702
You even know their names?
Oh, my God.

1255
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,158
- No, let's go.
- Of course he knows my name!

1256
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:12,574
♪ Say my name, say my name ♪

1257
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,875
Yo, you're the bitch they threw out!

1258
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,877
Shut your ass up, girl!

1259
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,380
What is the prostitute saying to you?

1260
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:26,512
These are the type of hoes you like?
Dumbass hoes like this?

1261
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,806
He comes home every night
smelling like cheap perfume

1262
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,059
and you don't say anything.

1263
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,561
I know my husband well enough.
Come on, let's go.

1264
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,726
You think you know him?
You are blind.

1265
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,399
Razmik, why?

1266
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,606
Why what? What?
She's been trying

1267
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,521
to destroy our family from day one.

1268
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,031
No, you are.

1269
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,033
Razmik, just apologize to the bitch.

1270
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:51,033
Don't be a pussy, yo.
Do not apologize for shit, yo!

1271
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,118
Shut up and get out
of our business, okay?

1272
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,199
That's right, Ra-Ra.
You should apologize

1273
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,206
for taking her to
a fucked up hairdresser.

1274
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,045
Oh, that's catty, bitch.

1275
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,059
What is the prostitute saying to you?

1276
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:05,425
Razmik supports the family.
He takes care of us.

1277
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:09,176
What are you talking about?
He only takes care of himself.

1278
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,635
I'm going home.

1279
01:15:10,798 --> 01:15:13,597
Mom, what do you want to do,
destroy my family?

1280
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:15,474
I'll see you in ten years, kid!

1281
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,438
Oh, my God, I hate men.

1282
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,606
I'm going to rip his mask off.

1283
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,109
Sometimes a wife
has to turn a blind eye.

1284
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:23,565
No! No!

1285
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,231
Get her! Throw a donut at that bitch!

1286
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,446
Have her, mama.
Chester!

1287
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:34,864
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Bitch call me. Yo, your wife is hot.

1288
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:38,001
I just call the cops. You and you
and you all get out! Out!

1289
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,332
No, no, no.
Mamasan, I'm sorry.

1290
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:42,041
Get the fuck out, now.

1291
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,266
We cool?

1292
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,063
I know what you're trying to do.

1293
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,557
Come on, I ain't trying to do shit.

1294
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:05,020
Come on, let me get some of that.

1295
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,204
You know you really
piss me off sometimes, Chess.

1296
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,494
I know. I know.

1297
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,666
But it's good to see you, baby.

1298
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,630
Good to see you, too.

1299
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,295
You know,
I kinda wish she didn't tell me.

1300
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,427
Wait. You wish who
didn't tell you what?

1301
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:34,632
Duh.

1302
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,183
What do you mean, duh?

1303
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,519
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.
- What?

1304
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,188
This bitch is the one that told you
about this shit?

1305
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:43,588
You the one that caused
all this motherfucking commotion?

1306
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:45,601
Her motherfucking ass
goes motherfucking crazy

1307
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,233
on one of my hoes
'cause you started this shit?

1308
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,065
You get my ass thrown out
of motherfucking Donut Time

1309
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:53,155
where I conduct
my day to day shit, right?

1310
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,862
You act so motherfucking high
and mighty about this shit.

1311
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,575
Yeah, yeah, I see it.

1312
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,999
No, no, no, no. But here the thing.
Here the thing...

1313
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,249
What didn't she tell you?

1314
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:03,786
She didn't tell you that me and her
were knocking it three weeks ago.

1315
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,045
- Oh, shit!
- What?

1316
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,924
You didn't wanna fucking tell her
that part.

1317
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,417
You saved her that shit.
You didn't tell her.

1318
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,922
- Oh, shit.
- Sin-Dee...

1319
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:12,678
Sin-Dee fucking what?

1320
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,050
Can you motherfucking believe
this shit?

1321
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:15,381
What is he talking about?

1322
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:18,012
I fucked your best friend.
Yeah, that's right.

1323
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,969
Oh, you fucking didn't tell her?

1324
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:22,059
Oh, that's interesting
you fucking tell her about this shit

1325
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:23,268
but not about me and you.

1326
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,316
No, no, no. That's right. No, no.
Don't get it twisted.

1327
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:27,814
Don't get it twisted, girl.

1328
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:29,695
This bitch don't give no fuck
about you.

1329
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:31,175
She don't give no fuck about you.

1330
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:34,700
Don't get it twisted. She jealous.
She jealous of my hoes.

1331
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:37,194
You know what I think?
I think she jealous of us.

1332
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:39,956
You didn't tell her that shit,
did you?

1333
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,575
I see what's motherfucking
going on here...

1334
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,036
I see what is
fucking going on here...

1335
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:49,924
This motherfucking girl thing.
This is between y'all asses.

1336
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:53,674
This between you two. Right? Right?
So I'm motherfucking out.

1337
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:56,882
This is some girl shit.
You guys work this motherfucker out.

1338
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:59,675
Let me know when you get it fixed up.
Let me know.

1339
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:03,062
Yo, the shit she did to me was just
a warm up for your ass, bitch.

1340
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:21,239
You two deserve each other.

1341
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,756
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- What?

1342
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,714
- She about to get her ass beat.
- Shut your stupid ass up.

1343
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,216
Shut your dumb ass up.

1344
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,502
Sin-Dee.

1345
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,767
Sin-Dee, talk to me.

1346
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,976
Look, I didn't mean to hurt you,
sweetheart.

1347
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,229
You know you're my best friend.

1348
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:56,361
You know I love you.
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

1349
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,279
Say something.

1350
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,289
Can I at least take a cab home?

1351
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:09,791
Oh, shit. Like that Armenian dude
just left, so...

1352
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,293
I mean,
I guess you're like shit out of luck.

1353
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:16,635
Get down.

1354
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,843
No wonder she's crying
having a father like that.

1355
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:21,094
Mother, please.

1356
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,277
Sin-Dee...

1357
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:27,573
Sin-Dee,
will you just talk to me? Come on.

1358
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:47,559
Y'all got a...

1359
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,561
Look...

1360
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:02,654
It was only once.
It didn't mean a thing.

1361
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:33,271
Hey.

1362
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:42,574
Yeah... I have a full house.
I called in another girl.

1363
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,490
So... just hang, okay?

1364
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:44,256
Please, Sin-Dee. I'm sorry.

1365
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:48,096
Great, now get the fuck out of here
and leave me alone.

1366
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:04,113
Now let me make my money
and go the fuck home.

1367
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,210
Hi, are we looking for a party...

1368
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:20,411
Oh-ho!

1369
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,040
- Oh, my God.
- Merry Christmas, you tranny faggot.

1370
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:28,086
We pissed on your friend, bitch!

1371
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,310
Oh, my God.
They just threw fucking piss on me.

1372
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,438
It's in my mouth.

1373
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:39,891
- It's in my fucking hair!
- Wait, wait.

1374
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:41,737
I don't have no fucking money
for new hair.

1375
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:51,406
Oh, my God, <i>come</i> on, come on.
Take this off.

1376
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:55,163
Oh, my God.

1377
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,039
You know what, why don't
I just take these off too, huh?

1378
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:07,130
This has to come off too.

1379
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:10,425
Okay.

1380
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:44,622
Girl... here.

1381
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:00,053
Oh, girl.

1382
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:01,764
Pull that down.

1383
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,935
We'll just be bald together.

1384
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:10,815
That actually looks good on you.

1385
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:15,278
Now, as for me...

1386

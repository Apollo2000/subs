3
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:40,469
Memory is a
selection of images,

4
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:41,737
some elusive,

5
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,707
others printed indelibly
on the brain.

6
00:00:50,613 --> 00:00:53,380
The summer I killed my father,
I was 10 years old.

7
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:57,817
My brother poe was 9,

8
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:01,520
and my sister cisely
had just turned 14.

9
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:04,823
The town we lived in
was named after a slave.

10
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:07,458
It's said that when
general Jean Paul batiste

11
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,493
was stricken with cholera,

12
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:11,661
his life was saved
by the powerful medicine

13
00:01:11,663 --> 00:01:15,598
of an African slave woman
called Eve.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,734
In return for his life,
he freed her

15
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:22,604
and gave her this piece
of land by the bayou.

16
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:25,539
Perhaps in gratitude,
she bore him 16 children.

17
00:01:28,343 --> 00:01:31,711
We are the descendants
of Eve and Jean Paul batiste.

18
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:35,514
I was named for her.

19
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,258
He better grab it now

20
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,693
while it still fits
in his hands.

21
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:01,529
From what I hear,
ain't just him gettin' it.

22
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:02,796
You better tell.

23
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:05,931
You don't let nothin'
fall out, baby.

24
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:07,934
I might have to catch it.

25
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:23,547
Don't hurt yourself
with that thing, boy.

26
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,415
Ain't it lovely?

27
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:29,919
Did you see Ethel
last night? Her face?

28
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:32,888
She need to get
those teeth fixed.

29
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,590
Harry, why do you
always wait to do that

30
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:36,591
when we drunk?

31
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:38,292
Put down the camera, darling.

32
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:39,426
My baby Mozelle thinks pictures

33
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,294
make her look fat.

34
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:42,828
Put down
the damn camera, Harry.

35
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,696
Uh, Harry...

36
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:45,863
Ohh. Man.

37
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:47,898
Here's your favorite niece.

38
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,733
Oh, there she go.

39
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:51,935
Wait. Hold on, sweetness.

40
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:54,404
Hey, red, what you
got for me, baby?

41
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,539
A kiss and a chocolate...

42
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,840
For a price.

43
00:03:57,842 --> 00:03:59,608
Well...

44
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,842
A price...

45
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:02,343
What do I get...

46
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:03,610
For this?

47
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:05,612
2 kisses and all the chocolates

48
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:06,613
you can eat.

49
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:08,815
That's my baby.

50
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,684
Here you go, sweetie.

51
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,218
Thank you.

52
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,587
Eve...

53
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,323
Where did you get those
delicious-looking chocolates?

54
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,491
You told me
to help serve, mama.

55
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,526
Yeah. Things taste
kind of good.

56
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:24,960
They're crunchy.
Something in 'em.

57
00:04:24,962 --> 00:04:28,430
Well, don't just stand here
and let Harry eat them all.

58
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:32,567
Ooh.

59
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,335
Ohh.

60
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:37,371
There's my baby boy.

61
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:45,411
You having a good time, honey?

62
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:47,245
Are you? Hmm?

63
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:52,282
Chocolates, poe?

64
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:00,823
They're bees.

65
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:05,693
Chocolate-covered bees!

66
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,762
Eve batiste!

67
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:10,296
Ooh!

68
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:12,831
I'll kill you!

69
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,032
You got a candy!

70
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:16,634
Now you gonna turn into a bee!

71
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:23,507
Tybalt.

72
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,008
Mercutio.

73
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,276
The prince
expressly hath forbid

74
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:29,344
this bandying
in verona streets.

75
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,882
Really.

76
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:37,517
Make yourselves useful.

77
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,985
Help me with the champagne.

78
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:42,020
<i>Vive les batistes.</i>

79
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:43,688
<i>Bon chance et bon santé.</i>

80
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,688
<i>Merde.</i>

81
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,702
Ah, you in trouble now.

82
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,079
Look at daddy.

83
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:15,914
Whoo!
Whoo!

84
00:06:18,318 --> 00:06:19,583
Ooh, Roz,

85
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,451
look at your husband.

86
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:24,987
You must be so proud.

87
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,955
Your son's the best
colored doctor

88
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:28,723
in all Louisiana.

89
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,627
Louis got every woman
in the parish

90
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,395
thinking he the second coming.

91
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:46,671
Louis, I used to be able
to keep up with you.

92
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,939
Ah, you're just out of
practice, that's all.

93
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:55,077
Come on, baby doll.

94
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,079
Let's show 'em how to dance.

95
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,748
¶ ever since the day
you walked into my life ¶

96
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,083
¶ all I do is live for you ¶

97
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:03,884
¶ from the time
you held me tight ¶

98
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:05,986
¶ you're in my dreams
at night ¶

99
00:07:05,988 --> 00:07:08,488
¶ and when I'm feelin' blue ¶

100
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,524
¶ I pretend I'm lovin' you ¶

101
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:14,026
¶ I pretend I'm lovin' you ¶

102
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:16,828
¶ what else can I do, now? ¶

103
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,630
¶ 'cause when I look
at you, now ¶

104
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:21,765
whoo!
Whoo!

105
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,501
<i>He, vous aut ga ca!</i>

106
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:25,869
Can my daughter dance?

107
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:33,808
Hey, red.

108
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,843
Red, you wanna dance, sweetie?

109
00:07:37,513 --> 00:07:38,545
No, thanks.

110
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:00,090
I can't see a thing.

111
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:01,624
Just hold my hand.

112
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,759
Shit, don't worry
about seeing, all right?

113
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,674
Mmm!

114
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:22,542
Hmm. Matty.

115
00:09:33,587 --> 00:09:35,553
What the...

116
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:36,153
Shit.

117
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:56,938
Come on. Come here.

118
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,674
Come on. Come on.

119
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:01,242
Come on. Come on.

120
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:02,776
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

121
00:10:02,778 --> 00:10:05,612
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

122
00:10:05,614 --> 00:10:06,613
Breathe.

123
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:07,747
Come on, breathe.

124
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:08,748
Breathe deep.

125
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,149
Deep breath.

126
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:12,717
Deep breath.

127
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:13,984
That's right.

128
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:14,985
That's right.

129
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:18,655
Sor...

130
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,155
S-sorry.

131
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,158
I was asleep.

132
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,526
Aw.

133
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:27,027
That's ok, baby.

134
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,995
You scared us, too.

135
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:30,997
Sure did.

136
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,167
All right?

137
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,774
You remember
Mrs. mereaux.

138
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,776
Almost gave me a heart attack.

139
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,678
Sorry I scared you,
Mrs. mereaux.

140
00:10:49,947 --> 00:10:51,313
Uh, Matty,

141
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:54,082
would you mind going inside
and fixing me a drink

142
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:55,917
while I talk to my daughter?

143
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,285
Of course not.

144
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,189
Good night, Eve.

145
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,357
Good night,
Mrs. mereaux.

146
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Would you like to go outside?

147
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:22,938
Good night, Willie.

148
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,939
<i>Bon soir, Louis.</i>

149
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:42,088
Daddy loves you <i>so</i> much.

150
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:45,924
I know.

151
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:47,291
I know you know.

152
00:11:50,896 --> 00:11:52,328
You love mama?

153
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,333
Your mama...

154
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,035
Is the most beautiful...

155
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:03,937
Perfect woman I ever met.

156
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,239
Your mama's a lady,

157
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:10,242
and I'll always love her.

158
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:12,110
Always.

159
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:13,444
You understand?

160
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:19,181
Daddy.

161
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,386
Yes, baby?

162
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:29,490
How come you never
dance with me?

163
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:33,193
Baby, how can you say

164
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:35,195
your daddy never dances
with you?

165
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:38,031
When we're alone and stuff,

166
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,866
but not at parties.

167
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:41,334
You always dance with cisely.

168
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:45,771
Tell you what,

169
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:47,272
from now on,

170
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:49,741
we'll dance at every party.

171
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:51,109
All right?

172
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,148
Heh heh heh.

173
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,283
Mmm.

174
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:05,286
There you are.

175
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:07,288
I was looking for you two.

176
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,924
Eve...

177
00:13:10,926 --> 00:13:12,292
It is past midnight.

178
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:15,895
Your cohorts
are already in pajamas.

179
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:17,263
I was talking to daddy.

180
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,366
Well, I guess that's legal.

181
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,269
Hey, you...

182
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,307
Are you sober?

183
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:32,908
Yes, ma'am.

184
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,910
Heh. Just barely.

185
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:41,815
You have fun tonight?

186
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,283
I bet you did.

187
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:47,285
Well, go straight to bed

188
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:49,520
and don't forget
to say your prayers.

189
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:50,521
Never...

190
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:53,223
Cheat the
man upstairs.

191
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:01,163
Ok.

192
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:01,929
Good night, mama.
Good night, daddy.

193
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:02,897
Good night, baby.

194
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,332
Night-night.

195
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,802
What's wrong with her?

196
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:16,173
Oh, she'll be all right.

197
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:17,941
And what about you?

198
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:20,409
What about me?

199
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:23,512
You sober?

200
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:26,848
Barely.

201
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,855
You coming in?

202
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:35,989
In a minute.

203
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:00,879
Hey.

204
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:04,348
Where were you?

205
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,482
I looked all over.

206
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,585
I was outside with daddy.

207
00:15:10,988 --> 00:15:12,487
Before that.

208
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:14,288
I was in the carriage house.

209
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,525
Well, you was in there
a long time.

210
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:30,299
I fell asleep.

211
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,402
What's wrong, rabbit?

212
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:37,871
What's the matter? What?

213
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,372
What is it?

214
00:15:39,374 --> 00:15:41,240
Nothing.

215
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:43,041
Hey, don't tell me
it's nothing.

216
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,876
What's wrong?

217
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,278
I saw daddy.

218
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:54,883
I was asleep...

219
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,551
And I woke up...

220
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,320
And...

221
00:15:59,322 --> 00:16:00,521
Daddy...

222
00:16:00,523 --> 00:16:01,989
What?

223
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:03,656
Daddy and Mrs. mereaux.

224
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:08,994
What about daddy
and Mrs. mereaux?

225
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:12,997
I saw them kissing.

226
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:14,999
Don't be stupid.

227
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,167
Daddy wouldn't touch that cow.

228
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:18,668
It's true. I saw them.

229
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,302
He had his hands on her.

230
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:22,170
It's true.

231
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:24,438
He was all up against her,
and her dress was...

232
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,072
that's a lie!

233
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:27,907
I saw them!

234
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:29,909
He was all up against her,

235
00:16:29,911 --> 00:16:32,378
and her dress was all up,
and they were rubbing!

236
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,379
Shh!

237
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,614
Shh!

238
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:37,082
Stop it.

239
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:39,450
Just stop it.

240
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:44,955
I'm gonna tell you
what happened.

241
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:53,062
What?

242
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:54,930
I can't see a thing.

243
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,465
You don't need to see.
Just hold my hand, sugar.

244
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:02,936
They came in to
get some more wine.

245
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:08,374
And daddy told her a joke,

246
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:11,009
and she fell against him
laughing.

247
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:14,211
And they woke you up.

248
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:20,149
You sure?

249
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,385
I'm certain.

250
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,387
I mean, what would daddy want

251
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:27,589
with Matty mereaux?

252
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:29,257
Mama's the most beautiful woman

253
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:30,691
in the whole world.

254
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:34,327
You go to bed.

255
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:37,730
It's late.

256
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,301
You scared me.

257
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,274
God damn it, Harry,
wait a minute.

258
00:17:51,276 --> 00:17:52,742
I'm leaving,
I'm driving,

259
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:55,044
and I'm taking
my damn wife with me.

260
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,311
Naw, naw, naw. Hell, no.

261
00:17:56,313 --> 00:17:57,545
Mozelle!

262
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:59,380
Now, you're either gonna
let Mozelle drive,

263
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,382
or y'all gonna
stay here tonight.

264
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:03,417
Or... or I'm... I'm
gonna whup your ass.

265
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,752
Shit. You better get
your hands off me, man.

266
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,019
Look, I may be drunk,

267
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,687
but I can whip your butt.

268
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:09,688
Well, come on, then.

269
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,488
Stop it, you assholes!

270
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,989
Oh, Harry!

271
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,192
Break it up!
All right!

272
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:17,862
Now... now... now what your
monkey ass gonna do, huh?

273
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,264
Stop it.

274
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,431
Nigger, just 'cause
you a doctor,

275
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,800
you think you know
every fuckin' thing.

276
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,501
You don't know
<i>every</i> fuckin' thing.

277
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:26,535
God damn it, Harry!

278
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:28,303
Daddy! Uncle Harry!

279
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:29,504
Stop it. It's late.

280
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,172
You wanna raise the dead?

281
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:32,506
Cisely, go back to bed.

282
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:33,640
You're not dressed,
and it's bedtime.

283
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:35,375
Not till daddy comes in.

284
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:37,110
<i>Toi, tu es vrai cochon parfois,</i>

285
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:38,111
<i>tu connais?</i>

286
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:39,112
Fuck you, doc.

287
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:40,813
I'm sick of your shit.

288
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:41,814
Come on. Come on.

289
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,848
Just give me
the damn keys, Harry!

290
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:50,554
Now get in the goddamn car
before I kill you.

291
00:18:51,557 --> 00:18:54,691
Don't talk to me
like that, baby.

292
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:56,793
<i>Dis bon soir, Harry.</i>

293
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:58,194
Good night.

294
00:18:58,196 --> 00:18:59,295
Good night, slugger.

295
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:00,896
<i>Bon soir, Mozelle.</i>

296
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:02,230
Good night, aunt Mozelle.

297
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:03,564
Good night, aunt Mozelle.

298
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:05,232
Good night, Uncle Harry.

299
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:06,799
Good night, y'all.
Be good.

300
00:19:09,703 --> 00:19:11,335
Good night, red.

301
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:13,603
Good night, cisely.

302
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:14,604
Fuck you, doc.

303
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:16,272
Shut the hell up.

304
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:40,927
How cute.

305
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,361
What do I get... For this?

306
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:49,333
I'm so sorry to
hear about Harry.

307
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:52,169
I don't know why
the lord sees fit...

308
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:55,338
Good night, red.

309
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:07,815
Mozelle, are you...

310
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:08,816
oh, my lord.

311
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:10,918
Louis! Louis, wake up!

312
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,386
God bless Uncle Harry.

313
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:21,193
And God bless Uncle maynard

314
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:22,527
and Uncle Anderson.

315
00:21:32,663 --> 00:21:34,329
Aunt Mozelle.

316
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:35,330
Wake up.

317
00:21:37,634 --> 00:21:39,467
What for?

318
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:44,004
You got clients coming.

319
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,751
Mozelle.

320
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:04,488
You don't look so bad.

321
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:10,694
I loved them.

322
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,729
I swear I did.

323
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:15,531
I know.

324
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:18,533
It's not your fault they die.

325
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:23,070
¶ trouble in mind ¶

326
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:25,906
¶ I am blue ¶

327
00:22:25,908 --> 00:22:30,844
¶ but I won't be blue always ¶

328
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:33,680
¶ for the sun will shine ¶

329
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:37,016
¶ in my back door someday ¶

330
00:22:37,018 --> 00:22:39,418
which one did you love best?

331
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,986
I don't know, Eve.

332
00:22:40,988 --> 00:22:43,054
They was all different.

333
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:47,391
Anderson was the handsomest man

334
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:48,558
I'd ever seen.

335
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:54,497
Your Uncle Harry,
he was the sweetest.

336
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,333
And maynard...

337
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,902
Maynard loved me most of all.

338
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:04,772
You know, even when
I was your age,

339
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:07,541
before I ever did
the counseling,

340
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:09,809
I could look at people,

341
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:10,843
complete strangers,

342
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:14,413
and see their
whole life so clear.

343
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:17,716
But I looked at each
of my husbands...

344
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:19,050
Never saw a thing.

345
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:22,986
That's the way it always is,

346
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:25,021
blind to my own life.

347
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:28,924
<i>Eh, bien.</i>

348
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:31,059
Now, go on.

349
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,995
Make yourself invisible
for a while.

350
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,864
If you're quiet...

351
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:38,131
You'll be able to hear.

352
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:03,655
I'm so sorry about Harry,
Mozelle.

353
00:24:05,425 --> 00:24:07,892
I don't know why
the lord sees fit...

354
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:10,427
we're all servants
of divine will.

355
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:12,829
The lord giveth.
He taketh away.

356
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:15,464
Oh, well.

357
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:16,498
Close your eyes.

358
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:19,600
Lord, lead us

359
00:24:19,602 --> 00:24:22,135
in a direction
of righteousness.

360
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:23,436
Advise us

361
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:26,472
that we may become
wiser in thy will.

362
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:28,073
Amen.
Amen.

363
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,609
Speak your mind, my friend.

364
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:34,845
It's my boy.

365
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:39,716
My boy has run off,
and I don't know where.

366
00:24:39,718 --> 00:24:42,418
My husband and I have
been down on our knees

367
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,952
praying for 2 months.

368
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:50,858
I can't take it anymore.

369
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,459
I have to know.

370
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,900
He's alive, hilary.

371
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:40,237
You'll find him in Detroit...

372
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:43,506
At St. Michael's
hospital...

373
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,541
Next Tuesday.

374
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:52,713
Is he sick?

375
00:25:52,715 --> 00:25:54,247
Tell me.

376
00:25:57,952 --> 00:26:00,819
Your son's on drugs.

377
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:03,922
Go home and pray for strength.

378
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:06,491
You'll need strength
to help you through this.

379
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:33,983
The money is gone,
madame renard.

380
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:36,785
Your niece spent it all.

381
00:26:36,787 --> 00:26:38,153
I'm sorry.

382
00:26:40,824 --> 00:26:42,690
Oh, help me.

383
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:44,858
Oh, my God.

384
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,194
How will I live?

385
00:26:48,196 --> 00:26:51,797
Please help me.

386
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:14,885
I want you to get a small bag

387
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:16,753
of the skin of chamois.

388
00:27:16,755 --> 00:27:20,156
In it, place this piece
of lodestone

389
00:27:20,158 --> 00:27:22,658
and John the conqueror root.

390
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,927
Tie it with a piece
of devil's shoestring.

391
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:27,828
And in your right hand,

392
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,097
sprinkle 5 drops of holy oil.

393
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,969
Thank you, madame.

394
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:40,739
I'm hardly in a position
to repay your kindness...

395
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:42,107
What with my money gone.

396
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:43,842
<i>C'est arien, chère.</i>

397
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:48,212
Keep the bag next to your skin.

398
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm so sorry to hear
about your husband.

399
00:27:57,922 --> 00:28:00,722
He was such a fine man.

400
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:04,758
Thank you.

401
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:09,195
Don't be cute.

402
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,107
You told daddy you didn't
practice no voodoo.

403
00:28:24,878 --> 00:28:26,043
She was desperate.

404
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:28,311
Does it work?

405
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:30,079
We'll see.

406
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:32,815
But what if it don't?

407
00:28:32,817 --> 00:28:36,351
I don't think she'll sue me.

408
00:28:36,353 --> 00:28:38,286
Ha ha!

409
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:10,016
Oh, lord.

410
00:29:10,018 --> 00:29:12,084
What is it now?

411
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:13,685
What did you say?

412
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:14,952
I said,

413
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,787
well, I've got 3
of his damn babies!

414
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,221
You got that right!

415
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,791
How dare that woman
call my house!

416
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:23,827
There's absolutely nothing
in this world lower

417
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,929
than eavesdropping on
the conversation of others.

418
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:26,996
This is important.

419
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,197
It's private.

420
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,399
If they'd wanted you to hear,

421
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,833
they'd have left the door open.

422
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:35,203
I'm telling.

423
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:43,344
Lying about that...

424
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:46,847
woman been lying about that
since God invented them...

425
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:50,316
Daddy!

426
00:29:50,318 --> 00:29:52,151
Hey, cis.

427
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:53,352
You're in trouble.

428
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:55,120
Go down to kings
and come back later.

429
00:29:55,122 --> 00:29:56,955
Go quick.
They're really mad.

430
00:29:56,957 --> 00:29:59,157
Who mad, baby?

431
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,858
You'd think
a damn doctor...

432
00:30:03,295 --> 00:30:04,294
Who, them?

433
00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:06,796
They always mad.

434
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:11,132
He's that old?

435
00:30:11,134 --> 00:30:12,266
Oh, yeah, he's that old.

436
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,034
He seems like he's a hundred.

437
00:30:14,036 --> 00:30:16,302
He's not a hundred.

438
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:17,936
I think he used to go
out with<i> gran mére.</i>

439
00:30:17,938 --> 00:30:19,470
Grandma?

440
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:21,038
Yeah, they do seem like
they can make a good couple.

441
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,838
You really think so?

442
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,839
Mm-hmm.

443
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:27,476
<i>Gran mére</i> doesn't really
seem like she's that old.

444
00:30:27,478 --> 00:30:30,345
Oh,<i> gran mére</i> is old,
let me tell you.

445
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:32,347
You been taking your pills.

446
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:33,848
Good girl.

447
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,049
Oh, yes, doctor.

448
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:37,151
I'm feeling much better.

449
00:30:37,153 --> 00:30:39,319
Everything will be
just fine now.

450
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:43,823
Yes, everything is going
to be just fine, Louise...

451
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:46,225
As long as you keep
taking your pills.

452
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:47,392
Oh, I will.

453
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:52,329
Good-bye, madame renard.

454
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:54,330
Bye.

455
00:30:56,534 --> 00:30:58,200
Yes, lord...

456
00:30:58,202 --> 00:31:02,003
Everything will be just fine.

457
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:17,517
Your lungs are clear
as a bell, Stevie.

458
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,386
I think you're going to live.

459
00:31:25,225 --> 00:31:26,624
Doctor...

460
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:29,559
Could you give me
something for the pain?

461
00:31:32,363 --> 00:31:34,062
Eve...

462
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:36,564
Go on outside and play.

463
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:45,371
What pain is that, Stevie?

464
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:56,080
What was wrong with that lady?

465
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,481
Mrs. hobbs?

466
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:00,517
Well, some illnesses are
hard to put a finger on.

467
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,951
Is she having a baby?

468
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,653
No. Why you ask?

469
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:07,889
You ever want other kids?

470
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:10,024
No. Your mama and I
are perfectly happy

471
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:10,991
with the 3 kids we got.

472
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:13,460
No, I mean other kids.

473
00:32:13,462 --> 00:32:15,495
Besides us.

474
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:26,637
Open your mouth
and say "ahh."

475
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:29,039
Ahh...

476
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:32,341
No, I don't see
anything in there

477
00:32:32,343 --> 00:32:35,143
that would make you
say something so stupid.

478
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:37,478
I got to go to the hospital.

479
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,679
I have to take you home.

480
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:42,248
Oh, no. Please, daddy?

481
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:44,283
Tell you what.

482
00:32:44,285 --> 00:32:45,617
I'll race you.

483
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:46,517
Give you a head start.

484
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,352
Ok. Bye.

485
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:12,506
We're supposed to be
cheering each other up.

486
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,309
I know.

487
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:24,383
I was just wondering what
happened with that woman.

488
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:30,088
I suppose he fixed it.

489
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,390
He knows how to fix things.

490
00:33:34,193 --> 00:33:35,625
When I first met Louis,

491
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:37,259
I watched him set
this boy's leg

492
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:39,294
who had fallen out of a tree.

493
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:41,296
And I said to myself,

494
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:43,731
here's a man who can
fix things.

495
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:47,634
He's a healer.
He'll take care of me.

496
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,207
So I leave my family...

497
00:33:55,209 --> 00:34:00,244
And I move to this swamp...

498
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:04,181
And I find out he's just a man.

499
00:34:10,155 --> 00:34:13,355
We're two of a kind,
my brother and I.

500
00:34:16,293 --> 00:34:19,193
One day he'll turn around...

501
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:23,430
And he will see you
for the first time.

502
00:34:23,432 --> 00:34:25,165
And then he'll stop looking

503
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,999
for what he already has.

504
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:31,303
What if it's too late?

505
00:34:34,374 --> 00:34:37,708
Let's eat pomegranates...

506
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,744
Till our hands turn red and...

507
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,312
And all we can think about

508
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,180
is getting the juice off.

509
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,484
Hmm...

510
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,226
Mo!

511
00:34:58,228 --> 00:35:00,027
Mo, let's get
our fortunes told.

512
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,162
Not by her.

513
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:04,363
Come on, now.

514
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:06,331
You said you wanted
to cheer me up. Come on.

515
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,232
Roz, that woman couldn't
predict heat in August.

516
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:09,633
Mozelle batiste...

517
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:11,434
If I didn't know you
better, I'd say you had

518
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:13,235
a case of professional
jealousy.

519
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,670
Roz, I am a psychic counselor.

520
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:17,738
Elzora's a sideshow attraction.

521
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,306
Well, then there's
nothing to be afraid of.

522
00:35:19,308 --> 00:35:20,306
Come on.

523
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:25,777
Which one first?

524
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:29,647
Well...

525
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:33,317
My... my sister-in-law is
something of a skeptic.

526
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:36,219
But I'd very much
like my fortune told.

527
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:38,587
Sit down.

528
00:35:49,532 --> 00:35:51,198
Empty it.

529
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,246
You're in pain, my daughter.

530
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,315
Yes.

531
00:36:10,317 --> 00:36:13,251
There is an end
to your problem...

532
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:16,753
Though not one you imagined.

533
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:21,523
Stay quiet.

534
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:23,558
And wait.

535
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,160
Wait?

536
00:36:26,162 --> 00:36:28,662
Sometimes a soldier
fall on his own sword.

537
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:32,832
In 3 years time...

538
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:35,334
You will be happy again.

539
00:36:37,137 --> 00:36:38,335
3 years?

540
00:36:41,873 --> 00:36:43,572
Look to your children.

541
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:49,644
Dollar.

542
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:57,284
That's it?

543
00:36:57,286 --> 00:37:00,353
Just wait 3 years,
and everything will be fine?

544
00:37:00,355 --> 00:37:03,221
Look to your children.

545
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:06,289
Well...

546
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,695
Thank you.

547
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,664
I feel most enlightened.

548
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,465
Good afternoon.

549
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:21,634
You were right.
Come on.

550
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:23,435
Wait.

551
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:48,358
Some things are
better left unsaid.

552
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,427
I paid you a dollar, old woman.

553
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:54,329
Now tell my fortune.

554
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:56,331
I don't need no cat bones

555
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,833
to tell your fortune,
Mozelle batiste.

556
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:01,302
You are a curse.

557
00:38:01,304 --> 00:38:03,337
The black widow.

558
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:05,806
Next man who marries you
is a dead man,

559
00:38:05,808 --> 00:38:08,041
like the others.

560
00:38:08,043 --> 00:38:11,310
Always be that way.

561
00:38:17,417 --> 00:38:20,884
You're a horrid
old lying witch!

562
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:25,755
Wait a minute!

563
00:38:25,757 --> 00:38:26,555
Mozelle!

564
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:39,566
For heaven's sake,
what did she say?

565
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:41,801
It's all right.
It's just the heat.

566
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,803
I need to catch my...

567
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:45,404
mo, come on.
Let's not be in the street.

568
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:01,784
Mo?

569
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:03,418
Mo?

570
00:39:05,622 --> 00:39:06,721
It's dead.

571
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:09,056
Are you sure?

572
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:11,925
It's not moving, is it?

573
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:14,027
Maybe it's just sick.

574
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,497
It's dead, you little chicken.

575
00:39:24,504 --> 00:39:28,105
Aah!
Aah!

576
00:39:36,948 --> 00:39:39,348
Oh, cisely!

577
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,349
Thank heavens!

578
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:44,619
Where are Eve and poe?

579
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:46,487
Mama, I don't know.

580
00:39:47,756 --> 00:39:48,955
Oh, lord.

581
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:54,926
Are you all right?

582
00:39:54,928 --> 00:39:58,396
Are you all right?

583
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:01,599
No, just go. Git.
Go ahead. Come on!

584
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:05,469
Just go! Don't ask me,
just git!

585
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:10,640
You're telling me

586
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:11,574
you're going to lock
these kids up in the house

587
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,942
for the rest of the summer

588
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,910
'cause of something that
old fortune-teller told you?

589
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,712
She just kept saying,
"look to your children."

590
00:40:17,714 --> 00:40:20,147
And no sooner do we leave
than Mozelle has this vision

591
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:21,581
of a child getting hit.

592
00:40:23,084 --> 00:40:24,917
Roz, you know I love my sister,

593
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:26,252
but she's not unfamiliar

594
00:40:26,253 --> 00:40:27,586
with the inside
of a mental hospital.

595
00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:29,988
Louis, not in front
of the children.

596
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,022
They know.

597
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:32,056
Of course we know.

598
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:33,624
Know what?

599
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:34,725
Aunt Mozelle's crazy.

600
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:36,059
She is not!

601
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,761
She knows things.
People trust her.

602
00:40:38,763 --> 00:40:39,996
Sweetheart,

603
00:40:39,997 --> 00:40:41,230
your aunt Mozelle's
a little eccentric.

604
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,464
That fortune-telling's
something we let her do

605
00:40:42,466 --> 00:40:43,465
to keep her out of trouble.

606
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:45,166
She may be crazy,

607
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:48,002
but them visions
always come true.

608
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:50,537
Anyway...

609
00:40:50,539 --> 00:40:52,805
I've made up my mind.

610
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:54,473
They're staying in the house.

611
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:56,074
Till when?

612
00:40:57,577 --> 00:40:59,009
Well, I don't know.

613
00:40:59,011 --> 00:41:00,877
Till Mozelle says it's safe.

614
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:02,578
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

615
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,881
What if we promise
not to play in traffic?

616
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:07,949
Don't use that tone of voice
with me, cisely batiste.

617
00:41:07,951 --> 00:41:10,117
And don't be rolling
your eyes at your father

618
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,418
behind my back.

619
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,952
You're looking
right at us, mama.

620
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:14,520
Nothing ever happens
behind your back.

621
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:16,822
Don't talk back
to your mother, young lady!

622
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:18,890
You're not too big to beat.

623
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:20,057
Don't threaten
my daughter, mama.

624
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:21,658
You let her threaten me.

625
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:27,830
When I was growing up,
children did not participate

626
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:29,665
in the conversation of adults.

627
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:32,567
You can let them kids

628
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:34,502
back-talk and run wild
if you want to.

629
00:41:34,504 --> 00:41:36,070
You won't hear
another word out of me.

630
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,939
In my day,

631
00:41:38,941 --> 00:41:42,575
we were thankful
for signs and warnings.

632
00:41:42,577 --> 00:41:44,577
Go on and let
the little hooligans

633
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:45,811
get runned over.

634
00:41:45,813 --> 00:41:48,747
<i>Ca va plus tranquille</i>
<i>autour d'ici.</i>

635
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:51,116
It will be much quieter
around here.

636
00:41:56,856 --> 00:41:58,488
I want to thank you all

637
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,989
for the delightful family chat.

638
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:01,724
I have patients to see.

639
00:42:01,726 --> 00:42:02,891
Louis...

640
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:05,627
It's Sunday.

641
00:42:05,629 --> 00:42:07,228
When you find
a way to put sickness

642
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,463
on a 8-hour, 5-day schedule,
you let me know.

643
00:42:09,465 --> 00:42:10,864
Well, what's wrong with them
they can't wait a day?

644
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:13,533
Are you two going to fight?

645
00:42:13,535 --> 00:42:17,470
Some sickness is hard
to put a finger on.

646
00:42:21,175 --> 00:42:23,474
I'll be back soon as I can.

647
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:29,145
Which one of your patients
you going to see, Louis?

648
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,249
Woman, go get your palm read
and let me do my work.

649
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:49,630
You love your daddy, baby?

650
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:50,998
You know I do.

651
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,599
That's all I need.

652
00:43:01,176 --> 00:43:02,908
Excuse me, darling.

653
00:43:06,513 --> 00:43:08,779
Don't you think you're
being a little immature?

654
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:13,216
I beg your pardon?

655
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:15,618
Keeping us in the house

656
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,119
'cause aunt Mozelle's
seeing things

657
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:19,688
and not wanting daddy
to go to work.

658
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,623
What's wrong with you?

659
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,832
If you're lucky,

660
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:34,800
you might live long
enough to one day have

661
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:36,268
a husband and children
of your own,

662
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,870
but until then,
this is my house,

663
00:43:38,872 --> 00:43:39,904
and you will do as I say.

664
00:43:39,906 --> 00:43:40,771
Do you understand?

665
00:43:42,007 --> 00:43:44,974
I said, do you understand?

666
00:43:44,976 --> 00:43:47,008
Yes, ma'am.

667
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:50,845
Good.

668
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:59,218
No one leaves this house
until I say so.

669
00:44:17,605 --> 00:44:19,104
What man art thou,

670
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:21,039
that thus bescreen'd in night,

671
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:23,341
so stumblest on my counsel?

672
00:44:23,343 --> 00:44:24,975
By a name...

673
00:44:24,977 --> 00:44:28,178
I know not how
to tell thee who I am.

674
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,147
My ring says that
I am king myself...

675
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,883
What are you doing in there?!

676
00:45:10,885 --> 00:45:13,218
Go away!

677
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,695
Aah!

678
00:45:57,697 --> 00:46:00,197
Ouch!

679
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:02,199
God damn it.

680
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:03,833
<i>Ferme to guele, hein!</i>

681
00:46:03,835 --> 00:46:05,301
I heard you.

682
00:46:05,303 --> 00:46:07,303
You said
"God damn it."

683
00:46:07,305 --> 00:46:08,837
Eve.

684
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:11,005
You shouldn't be
sneaking up on people

685
00:46:11,007 --> 00:46:12,206
when they're swearing
to themselves.

686
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:13,707
Does it hurt?

687
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:14,908
What?

688
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,442
Your finger, mother.

689
00:46:16,444 --> 00:46:20,813
Oh. No, not too much.

690
00:46:20,815 --> 00:46:22,748
You're gonna cut your finger
off one of these days.

691
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,450
'Tis not so deep as a well,

692
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:28,085
nor so wide as a church door,

693
00:46:28,087 --> 00:46:31,755
but 'tis enough, 'twill serve.

694
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,293
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

695
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,862
What?

696
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:42,197
We read most of the tragedies.

697
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,499
We're starting on
the goddamn comedies.

698
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,101
You are asking to get hit.

699
00:46:48,104 --> 00:46:49,103
Baby!

700
00:46:50,172 --> 00:46:51,538
Lord have mercy.

701
00:46:53,441 --> 00:46:55,841
What happened, baby?

702
00:46:55,843 --> 00:46:56,875
You all right?

703
00:46:56,877 --> 00:46:59,010
Mama!

704
00:46:59,012 --> 00:47:00,044
Mama, where are you?!

705
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:01,045
Hey, mo.

706
00:47:01,047 --> 00:47:02,980
Poe, are you all right?

707
00:47:02,982 --> 00:47:04,448
Look what I found in the attic.

708
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:07,184
A monopoly board
and Chinese checkers.

709
00:47:07,186 --> 00:47:08,251
Girl, you could find
the czar of Russia

710
00:47:08,253 --> 00:47:09,252
in that attic.

711
00:47:09,254 --> 00:47:11,387
I despise Chinese checkers.

712
00:47:11,389 --> 00:47:12,888
I hate her!
I hate her!

713
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:15,590
I wish she was dead!

714
00:47:15,592 --> 00:47:18,893
I feel like I walked into
the middle of a cyclone.

715
00:47:18,895 --> 00:47:21,395
Eve, what did you do
to your brother?

716
00:47:21,397 --> 00:47:23,263
I'm going to push him
out of a window

717
00:47:23,265 --> 00:47:24,530
if I don't get
out of this house.

718
00:47:24,532 --> 00:47:26,215
Eve!

719
00:47:26,216 --> 00:47:27,899
Cisely's been
in the goddamn bathtub

720
00:47:27,902 --> 00:47:30,335
for an hour, you know that?

721
00:47:30,337 --> 00:47:32,570
She stayed in there
3 hours yesterday.

722
00:47:32,572 --> 00:47:33,938
Fortunately there's
more than one bathroom

723
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,907
in this house.

724
00:47:35,908 --> 00:47:37,875
Ain't that much dirt
in all Louisiana.

725
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:40,177
Get out of the damn tub!

726
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:42,112
You watch your
language, young lady.

727
00:47:42,114 --> 00:47:44,581
Mama keeps stabbing herself
in the kitchen.

728
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,616
Show her your hands, mama.

729
00:47:46,618 --> 00:47:48,084
I think you better hush.

730
00:47:48,086 --> 00:47:49,585
And where's daddy?

731
00:47:49,587 --> 00:47:51,286
He's never home.

732
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:53,254
He's supposed
to be home sometimes!

733
00:47:53,256 --> 00:47:55,122
Listen, you little ingrate...

734
00:47:55,124 --> 00:47:57,124
Your father works hard

735
00:47:57,126 --> 00:47:59,126
so we can have a house
with 4 bathrooms.

736
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:00,894
Not every night,
he's not working!

737
00:48:00,896 --> 00:48:02,495
I know he's not!

738
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:06,532
I... I mean...

739
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:09,368
Let me borrow you for a minute.

740
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:15,472
Poe?

741
00:48:19,311 --> 00:48:21,878
Is that your idea of being
a good daughter?

742
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,212
It's true.

743
00:48:23,214 --> 00:48:24,613
He never comes home,

744
00:48:24,615 --> 00:48:26,381
and it's making her nervous.

745
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:28,649
She cuts herself.

746
00:48:28,651 --> 00:48:30,250
Oh, and you're
just being helpful

747
00:48:30,252 --> 00:48:31,951
bringing it up, is that it?

748
00:48:31,953 --> 00:48:33,152
She's nervous

749
00:48:33,154 --> 00:48:35,587
'cause he's messing
with other women.

750
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:38,590
What did you say?

751
00:48:38,592 --> 00:48:40,892
Nothing.

752
00:48:40,894 --> 00:48:42,193
Play games with me,

753
00:48:42,195 --> 00:48:44,061
I swear, I'll slap you blind.

754
00:48:44,063 --> 00:48:45,595
It's true. I saw them.

755
00:48:45,597 --> 00:48:47,363
You saw who?

756
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:51,033
You have 5 seconds!

757
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:53,235
Daddy and Mrs. mereaux.

758
00:48:55,339 --> 00:48:56,338
God.

759
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,240
It was at the party.

760
00:48:59,242 --> 00:49:00,541
I was out
in the carriage house,

761
00:49:00,543 --> 00:49:02,209
and they didn't see me.

762
00:49:02,211 --> 00:49:04,344
And it was worse
than just kissing.

763
00:49:04,346 --> 00:49:05,345
They were...

764
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:07,580
hush! Hush!
Let me think a minute.

765
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:13,385
Have you told anyone?

766
00:49:15,088 --> 00:49:16,387
No.

767
00:49:16,389 --> 00:49:17,921
Well, that's good.

768
00:49:17,923 --> 00:49:21,391
Because if you tell anyone,
anyone at all,

769
00:49:21,393 --> 00:49:23,926
I'm going to kill you.

770
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:27,029
And if you get careless again
with your mama's feelings,

771
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:29,965
I swear, I'll do you harm.

772
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,533
You understand me?

773
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,167
Yes, ma'am.

774
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:38,105
Listen to me...

775
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:40,373
Your daddy loves you.

776
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,641
And he loves your mama.

777
00:49:42,643 --> 00:49:44,175
I know.

778
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:55,485
We are a lot the same,
your father and I.

779
00:49:58,223 --> 00:50:02,458
Except I don't have
no children to catch me.

780
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,661
Y'all are my children.

781
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:12,467
That's why maynard
got tired of me,

782
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:15,203
'cause I'm barren.

783
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:17,672
But...

784
00:50:17,674 --> 00:50:19,573
Maynard loved you.

785
00:50:19,575 --> 00:50:22,442
Maynard loved you most of all.

786
00:50:22,444 --> 00:50:25,011
I think he did,

787
00:50:25,013 --> 00:50:28,114
but I didn't know that
until I met hosea.

788
00:50:28,116 --> 00:50:30,349
Tell me about hosea.

789
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:32,717
You're too young to understand.

790
00:50:35,121 --> 00:50:36,520
But when I was with hosea,

791
00:50:36,522 --> 00:50:39,756
it was like my whole body
was burning.

792
00:50:39,758 --> 00:50:41,457
I'd come home,

793
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:46,461
I'd have to rub ice on my face
and neck to cool down.

794
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:51,265
If maynard knew,
he never said a word.

795
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:54,234
And then one night,
hosea showed up at the door.

796
00:50:54,236 --> 00:50:56,469
He said,
"pack your bags, woman.

797
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:57,736
I've come
to take you with me."

798
00:50:57,738 --> 00:51:01,139
And God help me...

799
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,774
I pushed past
my startled husband.

800
00:51:03,776 --> 00:51:06,009
I was going upstairs
to pack my bags,

801
00:51:06,011 --> 00:51:08,011
when I heard maynard say,

802
00:51:08,013 --> 00:51:11,547
in a tone I'd never
heard him use,

803
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:13,515
"I don't care who you are, sir,

804
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:16,718
"but if you don't leave
my house at once,

805
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,286
I will hurt you."

806
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:20,721
And I turned just in time

807
00:51:20,723 --> 00:51:24,657
to see hosea pull the gun out
and aim it at maynard.

808
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:29,328
"I'm in love with your wife,

809
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,729
"and if you try to stop us,

810
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:33,064
I'll kill you."

811
00:51:33,066 --> 00:51:36,100
Maynard walked right up

812
00:51:36,102 --> 00:51:39,736
and pushed his chest
in the barrel of that gun,

813
00:51:39,738 --> 00:51:42,605
and he said,

814
00:51:42,607 --> 00:51:44,607
"well, then,

815
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:46,642
"you'll have to kill me,

816
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:50,579
because my wife
ain't going nowhere."

817
00:51:50,581 --> 00:51:54,382
Oh, Eve...

818
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:59,486
In that moment, I knew
that I loved maynard.

819
00:51:59,488 --> 00:52:03,823
He was so calm and brave,

820
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:05,424
and it was hosea
who was trembling.

821
00:52:07,528 --> 00:52:10,061
Maynard said...

822
00:52:10,063 --> 00:52:12,797
"Mozelle...

823
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:17,434
"Tell this man you ain't
going nowhere with him,

824
00:52:17,436 --> 00:52:21,471
so he can get the hell
out of my house."

825
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:26,342
Mama was standing in
the doorway of the kitchen,

826
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:29,143
and she was holding
her heart like this.

827
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,447
I walked slowly over...

828
00:52:48,662 --> 00:52:53,831
And I stood next to my husband,

829
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:58,335
and I looked at my lover,

830
00:52:58,337 --> 00:53:01,671
this man who had lit
this great fire in me,

831
00:53:01,673 --> 00:53:06,108
and I said,
please, leave our house.

832
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:09,878
I never want to see you again.

833
00:53:11,414 --> 00:53:13,414
Hosea's eyes
went another color,

834
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:15,816
and he stopped trembling.

835
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,852
He looked right at me,

836
00:53:18,854 --> 00:53:21,120
and he said...

837
00:53:21,122 --> 00:53:23,489
All right then.

838
00:53:25,192 --> 00:53:30,594
And he shot maynard
in the chest.

839
00:53:30,596 --> 00:53:33,530
And I was alone...

840
00:53:33,532 --> 00:53:36,266
For a while.

841
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:51,380
Daddy, it's late.

842
00:53:51,382 --> 00:53:52,748
What you doing up?

843
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,382
Waiting for you.

844
00:53:54,384 --> 00:53:56,183
What you think I'm doing up?

845
00:54:00,522 --> 00:54:03,322
What's your pleasure
this evening, doctor?

846
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:06,358
Scotch and water, bartender.

847
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,559
Hey, daddy.

848
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:09,794
Hey, pumpkinhead.

849
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,697
Ahh, look who's up.

850
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:16,466
You know what time it is?

851
00:54:16,468 --> 00:54:18,901
It's time for you gals
to be in bed.

852
00:54:18,903 --> 00:54:20,235
No, daddy.

853
00:54:20,237 --> 00:54:22,237
Yes. Your mama
would kill me

854
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:23,905
if she finds out I had you up.

855
00:54:25,341 --> 00:54:26,773
Good night, night owls.

856
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:30,643
Good night, daddy.

857
00:55:23,861 --> 00:55:25,527
Can I help you?

858
00:55:25,529 --> 00:55:27,762
Are you Mozelle batiste?

859
00:55:27,764 --> 00:55:29,296
I am.

860
00:55:29,298 --> 00:55:31,531
Am I disturbing you?

861
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:35,534
I don't know yet.

862
00:55:35,536 --> 00:55:38,403
My name is Julian Grayraven.

863
00:55:38,405 --> 00:55:41,639
Folks around here
say you read the future.

864
00:55:54,353 --> 00:55:57,821
My wife left me a year ago.

865
00:55:57,823 --> 00:56:01,691
I've been to many cities
searching for her.

866
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:07,663
I have no place
to return to anymore.

867
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,400
I'm exhausted.

868
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:16,738
I cannot continue, and yet...

869
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:20,641
I cannot stop until I know.

870
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:24,044
Where's my wife?

871
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:09,046
¶ I want a Sunday
kind of love ¶

872
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:17,624
¶ a love to last
past Saturday night ¶

873
00:57:18,827 --> 00:57:23,095
¶ and I'd like to know ¶

874
00:57:23,097 --> 00:57:26,597
¶ it's more than love
at first sight ¶

875
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:34,570
¶ I want a Sunday
kind of love ¶

876
00:57:36,574 --> 00:57:44,574
¶ Sunday, Sunday,
Sunday kind of love ¶

877
00:57:53,823 --> 00:57:54,822
Eve!

878
00:57:54,824 --> 00:57:55,823
Where's cisely?

879
00:57:55,825 --> 00:57:58,192
Officer, you don't understand.

880
00:57:58,194 --> 00:58:00,160
I'm afraid she might
be hit by something.

881
00:58:00,162 --> 00:58:02,629
Yeah, day like today,

882
00:58:02,631 --> 00:58:04,130
there's bound to be accidents.

883
00:58:04,132 --> 00:58:05,865
Mama, please!

884
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:09,968
Cisely! Oh, God!

885
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,070
Oh, baby!

886
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,906
Oh, thank God.

887
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,742
Thank God.

888
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,710
What did you think,
running off like that?

889
00:58:19,712 --> 00:58:21,912
You almost gave your mama
a heart attack,<i> chère.</i>

890
00:58:21,914 --> 00:58:24,481
Where the hell did you go?

891
00:58:24,483 --> 00:58:26,049
I went to visit daddy.

892
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:28,217
Then I went
to the beauty parlor.

893
00:58:29,253 --> 00:58:30,819
You what?

894
00:58:41,097 --> 00:58:44,798
I walked all the way
to daddy's office,

895
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,500
and then I caught
the bus to opels'.

896
00:58:47,502 --> 00:58:49,702
I had to cross the train tracks

897
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:51,170
to get home,

898
00:58:51,172 --> 00:58:53,071
and I'm alive, mama.

899
00:58:53,073 --> 00:58:55,573
I didn't get hit by anything.

900
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:56,698
Come here, cisely.

901
01:00:12,982 --> 01:00:15,916
When I was your age,
I was just like you.

902
01:00:17,653 --> 01:00:20,987
I thought I knew everything.

903
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:23,255
Now even the things
I'm most familiar with

904
01:00:23,257 --> 01:00:25,623
seem mysterious to me.

905
01:00:28,027 --> 01:00:30,293
But I know I love you.

906
01:00:33,131 --> 01:00:35,097
And it's my job

907
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:39,101
to protect you as best I can.

908
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:41,770
If you disobey my orders
and leave this house again,

909
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:43,171
I swear I'll lock you
in your room,

910
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:44,872
do you hear me?

911
01:00:47,142 --> 01:00:48,374
Yes, ma'am.

912
01:00:48,376 --> 01:00:51,210
Go back to bed.

913
01:00:52,613 --> 01:00:55,814
I'm waiting up
for your father tonight.

914
01:00:55,816 --> 01:00:58,082
I don't want you waiting up
for him anymore.

915
01:00:58,084 --> 01:00:59,817
But, mama...

916
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:02,920
I'll say it one more time,
cisely.

917
01:01:07,393 --> 01:01:10,093
I know you love your daddy,

918
01:01:10,095 --> 01:01:12,695
and your daddy loves you.

919
01:01:14,632 --> 01:01:17,733
I don't want you waiting up
for him anymore.

920
01:01:39,754 --> 01:01:41,754
You get your
shit straight,

921
01:01:41,756 --> 01:01:43,255
or you're out of here!

922
01:01:43,257 --> 01:01:44,756
Look, Roz, Roz...

923
01:02:00,073 --> 01:02:02,406
Isn't it beautiful?

924
01:02:02,408 --> 01:02:04,007
You're beautiful.

925
01:02:07,212 --> 01:02:08,811
Mozelle...

926
01:02:11,448 --> 01:02:14,215
It's time for me to go.

927
01:02:14,217 --> 01:02:17,117
I have to find my wife.

928
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:18,818
Mr. Grayraven,

929
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,120
I told you,
she's not coming back.

930
01:02:21,122 --> 01:02:24,123
She's fallen in love.

931
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:27,192
I have to find my wife

932
01:02:27,194 --> 01:02:29,861
so that I can divorce her

933
01:02:29,863 --> 01:02:31,462
and marry you.

934
01:02:33,766 --> 01:02:36,099
Oh, Julian.

935
01:02:36,101 --> 01:02:40,002
It's enough that
you're here with me.

936
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:42,804
You have made me so happy.

937
01:02:42,806 --> 01:02:46,140
But you can't
possibly marry me.

938
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:49,042
I can't let that happen.

939
01:02:49,044 --> 01:02:50,843
Is it that you don't love me?

940
01:02:50,845 --> 01:02:52,044
No!

941
01:02:52,046 --> 01:02:56,048
No, it's not that.
It's...

942
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:58,115
Bear with me.

943
01:03:00,752 --> 01:03:02,718
I'm cursed.

944
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,787
I can't have children.

945
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:07,321
I'm barren.

946
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:13,293
You're not barren.

947
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,963
You're wounded...

948
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,065
Here.

949
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:27,304
And it's here
that I'll plant seeds.

950
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:44,052
Oh, my God!

951
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:46,954
Whose baby is this?

952
01:03:50,759 --> 01:03:51,891
Don't move him.

953
01:03:51,893 --> 01:03:54,159
Don't move him.

954
01:03:54,161 --> 01:03:56,995
Whose child
is this baby?

955
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:59,797
Oh, poor baby.

956
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:03,466
We're free! We're free!
We're finally free!

957
01:04:05,069 --> 01:04:07,869
And tonight,
we'll barbecue outside

958
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:10,037
and have a picnic.

959
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:12,773
I'm going outside.

960
01:04:12,775 --> 01:04:14,441
<i>C'est pas jiste feter</i>
<i>quand l'enfant</i>

961
01:04:14,443 --> 01:04:16,509
<i>de quelq'un est mort.</i>

962
01:04:16,511 --> 01:04:19,111
Oh, mama, these children have
been in the house for weeks.

963
01:04:19,113 --> 01:04:21,847
Eve, go upstairs
and get cisely.

964
01:04:21,849 --> 01:04:24,049
She hasn't come down
all morning.

965
01:04:24,051 --> 01:04:26,384
I think she's still mad at me.

966
01:04:28,121 --> 01:04:29,353
Cisely!

967
01:04:29,355 --> 01:04:31,254
It is not right to celebrate

968
01:04:31,256 --> 01:04:33,356
when somebody's child is dead.

969
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,827
Well, who's child
was it anyway?

970
01:04:37,829 --> 01:04:39,495
Dickey's boy.

971
01:04:41,465 --> 01:04:43,331
Cisely, wake up!
We're free!

972
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:45,800
We can go outside now, cisely!

973
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:47,234
Go away.

974
01:04:47,236 --> 01:04:50,003
Cisely, look,
some other kid got hit.

975
01:04:50,005 --> 01:04:51,938
We're free!

976
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:53,572
Go away!

977
01:04:53,574 --> 01:04:56,458
Aah!

978
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:59,343
Ooh, so that's what's
wrong with you.

979
01:04:59,346 --> 01:05:03,381
Look, you think just 'cause
you got blood in your pants

980
01:05:03,383 --> 01:05:05,049
you don't have to act
civilized no more?

981
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:06,050
Shut up!

982
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:12,922
Cisely's got her period!
I'm gonna tell daddy!

983
01:05:14,425 --> 01:05:16,892
Help!

984
01:05:16,894 --> 01:05:19,427
Stop! Mama!

985
01:05:19,429 --> 01:05:22,062
Cisely's trying to kill me!

986
01:05:22,064 --> 01:05:23,963
Get over here.
Get over here!

987
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:25,864
Aah!

988
01:05:25,866 --> 01:05:29,367
Cisely's trying to kill me!

989
01:05:29,369 --> 01:05:30,868
Aah!

990
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:32,236
Get off! Aah!

991
01:05:32,238 --> 01:05:35,472
Aah! Help!

992
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:36,840
Mama!

993
01:05:36,842 --> 01:05:39,442
Cisely's trying to kill me!

994
01:05:39,444 --> 01:05:41,243
She's trying to kill me!

995
01:05:41,245 --> 01:05:43,411
Come on.
No, come on!

996
01:05:45,348 --> 01:05:46,847
You all right?

997
01:05:48,283 --> 01:05:50,249
What happened?

998
01:05:50,251 --> 01:05:51,316
Let me go!

999
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:53,551
I'm gonna kill her!

1000
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:04,427
I don't know what happened.

1001
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:06,328
It's like she went crazy.

1002
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,129
We thought she was having
a seizure or something.

1003
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,597
We were so scared.

1004
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,434
Is it my fault
'cause I hit her?

1005
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:15,637
No, Roz, it's not your fault.

1006
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:18,006
Let me look at her.

1007
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:19,374
Louis...

1008
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,078
She started her period.

1009
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,380
Did you know that?

1010
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,381
No.

1011
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,518
She didn't even
tell me.

1012
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:54,306
Go away, daddy.
I don't want you here.

1013
01:06:54,308 --> 01:06:56,508
I just want to take your pulse

1014
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:59,444
and your temperature,
baby. Doctor stuff.

1015
01:06:59,446 --> 01:07:01,279
No!

1016
01:07:01,281 --> 01:07:03,447
I don't want you looking at me.

1017
01:07:06,752 --> 01:07:11,154
Ok. I know a nice
lady doctor

1018
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:13,156
we can take you to.

1019
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:14,390
Would you like that?

1020
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:55,094
Excuse me. How much
for this pineapple?

1021
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,267
I said, how much
for this pineapple?

1022
01:08:02,269 --> 01:08:04,335
25 cents. You want it?

1023
01:08:04,337 --> 01:08:06,537
That's too much.

1024
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:08,605
Hey!

1025
01:08:08,607 --> 01:08:10,773
Hey! Get her!

1026
01:08:15,479 --> 01:08:17,512
Bad girl.

1027
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:21,381
<i>Mechante 'tite.</i>

1028
01:08:23,852 --> 01:08:26,686
Bad girl.

1029
01:08:36,429 --> 01:08:37,661
Yes, I can!

1030
01:08:37,663 --> 01:08:39,162
No, you can't. Ha ha!

1031
01:08:39,164 --> 01:08:40,496
Yes, I can!

1032
01:08:40,498 --> 01:08:42,197
No, you can't!

1033
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:44,666
And I'm gonna be always
be able to beat you,

1034
01:08:44,668 --> 01:08:46,167
'cause you are a chicken!

1035
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:47,701
No, I'm not!

1036
01:08:50,272 --> 01:08:51,471
Cisely!

1037
01:08:51,473 --> 01:08:54,474
She blames me for not
making you happy,

1038
01:08:54,476 --> 01:08:56,209
or she thinks
I'm driving you away.

1039
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:58,211
She is a child, Roz.

1040
01:08:58,213 --> 01:09:00,313
Just give her time.

1041
01:09:00,315 --> 01:09:03,549
How much time, Louis?

1042
01:09:03,551 --> 01:09:06,485
It's already been 2 weeks.

1043
01:09:06,487 --> 01:09:09,154
She won't... Eat.

1044
01:09:09,156 --> 01:09:10,889
She won't speak.

1045
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:15,727
It's like she's sleepwalking.

1046
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:22,833
This, um...

1047
01:09:22,835 --> 01:09:25,669
Psychologist fellow
seems to think

1048
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:27,604
you need kind of a...

1049
01:09:27,606 --> 01:09:29,906
A vacation from us.

1050
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:32,842
It's just a suggestion.

1051
01:09:32,844 --> 01:09:36,445
We'd never send you away
unless you wanted to go.

1052
01:09:41,484 --> 01:09:43,650
Listen...

1053
01:09:43,652 --> 01:09:45,652
Whatever it is,

1054
01:09:45,654 --> 01:09:49,522
we can work it out together.

1055
01:09:49,524 --> 01:09:52,258
Everything's gonna be
fine again, I promise.

1056
01:09:57,398 --> 01:09:59,698
I want to go.

1057
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,633
What?

1058
01:10:05,639 --> 01:10:09,340
What'd you say, baby?

1059
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:11,608
I said, I want to go.

1060
01:10:16,414 --> 01:10:18,414
Well, it's all settled.

1061
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:22,651
I talked to your grandmother,

1062
01:10:22,653 --> 01:10:25,787
and she just can't
wait to see you.

1063
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:34,629
If you leave me alone
with them, I'll die.

1064
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:37,331
I'll die, cisely.

1065
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,368
What's wrong with you?

1066
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,969
Why won't you tell me?

1067
01:10:43,971 --> 01:10:46,204
Is it me?

1068
01:10:46,206 --> 01:10:48,539
Is it something that I did?

1069
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:52,809
Why won't you talk to me?

1070
01:10:56,214 --> 01:10:58,514
Of course it's not you, rabbit.

1071
01:11:03,487 --> 01:11:05,753
You're my only friend.

1072
01:11:05,755 --> 01:11:07,454
Then...

1073
01:11:07,456 --> 01:11:09,355
What is it?

1074
01:11:09,357 --> 01:11:13,692
Tell me. I promise
I won't tell anybody.

1075
01:11:16,296 --> 01:11:19,597
Do you remember the storm?

1076
01:11:19,599 --> 01:11:22,466
The day you cut your
hair and mama hit you?

1077
01:11:25,637 --> 01:11:29,605
Did you hear mama and daddy
fighting that night?

1078
01:11:29,607 --> 01:11:30,639
Yeah.

1079
01:11:32,476 --> 01:11:35,610
Part of it was about me

1080
01:11:35,612 --> 01:11:39,613
and how he let me
visit him that day.

1081
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:43,950
The other thing
they were fighting about...

1082
01:11:45,653 --> 01:11:47,719
Was Matty mereaux.

1083
01:11:49,656 --> 01:11:52,523
Mama knows about
daddy and Matty?

1084
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,693
Everybody knows.

1085
01:11:56,695 --> 01:11:58,027
She's been hanging
around his office,

1086
01:11:58,029 --> 01:11:59,795
right in front of everyone.

1087
01:11:59,797 --> 01:12:02,497
You believe me now

1088
01:12:02,499 --> 01:12:04,365
about what happened
at the party?

1089
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:09,369
I believed you then.

1090
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:13,505
Anyway...

1091
01:12:13,507 --> 01:12:17,975
I waited until I heard
mama go upstairs.

1092
01:12:20,646 --> 01:12:22,545
I went downstairs.

1093
01:12:26,417 --> 01:12:29,684
I was afraid of what
she might have said.

1094
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,391
I was afraid
he would divorce us.

1095
01:12:43,498 --> 01:12:46,432
I wanted to make him
feel better.

1096
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:58,375
I sat on his lap.

1097
01:12:59,578 --> 01:13:01,878
And I was scared.

1098
01:13:19,897 --> 01:13:21,663
And I was trying to get away,

1099
01:13:21,665 --> 01:13:24,599
and he was hugging me
and kissing me...

1100
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:27,501
Until I finally
pushed him away with my knee.

1101
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:31,471
I must have hurt him
because he hit me.

1102
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:34,106
He's never hit me.

1103
01:13:36,677 --> 01:13:38,877
Baby. Baby, I'm sorry.

1104
01:13:38,879 --> 01:13:41,679
And then I ran.

1105
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:45,916
I'll kill him, cisely.

1106
01:13:45,918 --> 01:13:47,984
I swear it.

1107
01:13:47,986 --> 01:13:51,120
I'll kill him for hurting you.

1108
01:14:09,906 --> 01:14:12,773
Bye-bye, now.

1109
01:14:12,775 --> 01:14:15,108
I'll be gone
a week or so.

1110
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:17,409
I just want to get her
settled in.

1111
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:22,447
Bye, poe.
Be good.

1112
01:14:31,991 --> 01:14:34,925
I'm just going
to drop them off.

1113
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:36,826
Be back before dinner.

1114
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:27,972
Maybe he ran into traffic.

1115
01:15:27,974 --> 01:15:29,506
It's Sunday.

1116
01:15:35,046 --> 01:15:38,514
He'll be back
and so will cisely.

1117
01:15:38,516 --> 01:15:41,483
I know she will.

1118
01:15:41,485 --> 01:15:44,486
Life is filled
with good-byes, Eve...

1119
01:15:44,488 --> 01:15:46,020
a million good-byes...

1120
01:15:46,022 --> 01:15:48,756
and it hurts every time.

1121
01:15:49,992 --> 01:15:53,460
Sometimes I feel like
I've lost so much,

1122
01:15:53,462 --> 01:15:56,930
I have to find
new things to lose.

1123
01:15:56,932 --> 01:16:01,134
All I know is there must be
a divine point to it all,

1124
01:16:01,136 --> 01:16:03,636
and it's just over my head.

1125
01:16:03,638 --> 01:16:08,540
Then, when we die,
it will all come clear,

1126
01:16:08,542 --> 01:16:10,174
and we'll say...

1127
01:16:10,176 --> 01:16:13,877
"So that was
the damn point."

1128
01:16:13,879 --> 01:16:17,914
And sometimes I think
there's no point at all,

1129
01:16:17,916 --> 01:16:20,516
and that's the point.

1130
01:16:20,518 --> 01:16:23,852
All I know is
most people's lives

1131
01:16:23,854 --> 01:16:26,621
are a great disappointment
to them.

1132
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:29,056
And no one leaves this earth

1133
01:16:29,058 --> 01:16:32,192
without feeling terrible pain.

1134
01:16:32,194 --> 01:16:35,195
And if there is
no divine explanation

1135
01:16:35,197 --> 01:16:37,230
at the end of it all, well...

1136
01:16:39,033 --> 01:16:41,600
That's sad.

1137
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:47,504
How do you kill someone
with voodoo?

1138
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:52,841
I almost forgot you was there.

1139
01:16:54,244 --> 01:16:57,245
I mean, do you just
wish real hard

1140
01:16:57,247 --> 01:16:59,013
that they were dead,

1141
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:01,248
or do you have to do
something special?

1142
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:05,052
I suppose you put some
of their hair on a doll

1143
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:06,787
and stick pins in it
or something.

1144
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,722
I really don't know.

1145
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:11,991
What makes you ask
a thing like that?

1146
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:13,225
Nothing.

1147
01:17:13,227 --> 01:17:16,361
Well, you must have been
thinking something

1148
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:18,796
right before
you were thinking that.

1149
01:17:18,798 --> 01:17:21,398
What led you to that
particular thought?

1150
01:17:22,868 --> 01:17:25,268
I don't know.

1151
01:17:26,938 --> 01:17:31,240
Is there someone around here
that you're angry with?

1152
01:17:31,242 --> 01:17:33,976
Someone that you want dead?

1153
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,145
I'm going inside.

1154
01:17:37,147 --> 01:17:41,315
No. I think you better
tell me what's on your mind.

1155
01:17:41,317 --> 01:17:44,851
You have 5 seconds.

1156
01:17:48,256 --> 01:17:50,856
Give me your hands.

1157
01:17:53,427 --> 01:17:55,960
Give them to me.

1158
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:12,141
Well, go on and keep secrets
if you want to.

1159
01:18:12,143 --> 01:18:14,076
I won't squeeze it out of you.

1160
01:18:14,078 --> 01:18:17,813
But you can't kill people
with voodoo.

1161
01:18:17,815 --> 01:18:18,847
That's ridiculous.

1162
01:19:23,778 --> 01:19:24,843
Hey, red.

1163
01:19:24,845 --> 01:19:27,245
Hah. Didn't mean
to startle you, baby.

1164
01:19:27,247 --> 01:19:28,946
Hi, Mr. mereaux.

1165
01:19:28,948 --> 01:19:30,948
Hi. How's your family?

1166
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:32,916
Everybody's fine.

1167
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:35,051
How's Matty?

1168
01:19:35,053 --> 01:19:36,419
Hey, same as always.

1169
01:19:36,421 --> 01:19:39,755
You know, salty and sweet.

1170
01:19:39,757 --> 01:19:41,123
What you looking for?

1171
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:43,325
Um... Apples.

1172
01:19:43,327 --> 01:19:44,859
Apples.

1173
01:19:44,861 --> 01:19:48,161
Well, you know, you just
walked right past them.

1174
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,433
Oh. Thanks.

1175
01:19:55,436 --> 01:19:57,269
Lord have mercy.

1176
01:20:06,446 --> 01:20:08,112
Mr. mereaux?

1177
01:20:08,114 --> 01:20:10,246
Yes, Eve?

1178
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,416
You still teachin'?

1179
01:20:14,418 --> 01:20:15,950
Sure, darling.

1180
01:20:15,952 --> 01:20:18,152
Down at Xavier, new Orleans.

1181
01:20:18,154 --> 01:20:19,820
Been there for years.

1182
01:20:19,822 --> 01:20:21,822
That's a long drive.

1183
01:20:21,824 --> 01:20:23,390
Yeah.

1184
01:20:23,391 --> 01:20:24,957
Well, you know, sometimes,
if the weather's bad,

1185
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,426
I just stay on campus.

1186
01:20:26,428 --> 01:20:28,428
But usually, you know,
I try to get home

1187
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:31,197
so Matty don't get too lonely.

1188
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,999
Matty don't seem like
the lonely type.

1189
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:36,134
Nah.

1190
01:20:36,136 --> 01:20:38,302
Nah, I guess not.

1191
01:20:38,304 --> 01:20:40,504
You must get home real late...

1192
01:20:40,506 --> 01:20:42,973
Well, when you get home.

1193
01:20:42,975 --> 01:20:45,041
Sometimes.

1194
01:20:45,043 --> 01:20:46,575
So does my daddy.

1195
01:20:46,577 --> 01:20:48,276
Every night.

1196
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:50,378
My mama gets real lonely.

1197
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:53,447
But then,
she's the lonely type.

1198
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:57,283
Not like daddy and Matty.

1199
01:20:59,587 --> 01:21:02,454
Well...

1200
01:21:02,456 --> 01:21:03,955
Bye.

1201
01:21:16,502 --> 01:21:18,134
Excuse me.

1202
01:21:27,177 --> 01:21:28,943
<i>Mechante 'tite fille.</i>

1203
01:21:30,212 --> 01:21:32,545
I remember you,
pineapple thief.

1204
01:21:35,983 --> 01:21:39,184
Um... Hi.

1205
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:42,120
I've been looking for you.

1206
01:21:42,122 --> 01:21:44,922
Only people ever look
for me got good reason.

1207
01:21:44,924 --> 01:21:46,023
I got good reason.

1208
01:21:46,025 --> 01:21:47,524
You got money?

1209
01:21:47,526 --> 01:21:49,359
$20.

1210
01:21:49,361 --> 01:21:51,861
20?!

1211
01:21:51,863 --> 01:21:53,262
Let me see.

1212
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:57,432
Give me.

1213
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:05,973
Wh-where
are we going?

1214
01:22:05,975 --> 01:22:07,474
My office.

1215
01:22:51,652 --> 01:22:55,253
Are you related
to Mozelle batiste?

1216
01:22:55,255 --> 01:22:57,321
I'm her niece.

1217
01:22:57,323 --> 01:22:59,122
And she's the one
you want dead.

1218
01:22:59,124 --> 01:23:01,124
No. Someone else.

1219
01:23:01,126 --> 01:23:03,526
Hmm. Too bad.

1220
01:23:03,528 --> 01:23:07,229
<i>Tant pis.</i> Why you want
this person dead?

1221
01:23:07,231 --> 01:23:08,363
<i>Quo fais?</i>

1222
01:23:08,365 --> 01:23:10,298
<i>Raisons prive.</i>

1223
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:13,467
This person... Harm you?

1224
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:16,336
Others in my family.

1225
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,339
I will give you something

1226
01:23:20,341 --> 01:23:22,474
to protect you and your family
from this person.

1227
01:23:22,476 --> 01:23:24,309
I want him dead!

1228
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:25,543
<i>M'ole li mort!</i>

1229
01:23:28,114 --> 01:23:30,514
For certain.
You are sure.

1230
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:34,183
Yes, ma'am.

1231
01:23:34,185 --> 01:23:38,187
People have a way of dying
at their own speed.

1232
01:23:38,189 --> 01:23:40,689
But I will see what I can do.

1233
01:23:42,192 --> 01:23:44,392
I will need some hair

1234
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,594
from the head of this person.

1235
01:23:46,596 --> 01:23:50,364
I brought you some from a comb.

1236
01:23:50,366 --> 01:23:51,998
I hope it's enough, though.

1237
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,466
Well...

1238
01:23:53,468 --> 01:23:55,134
<i>Eh, bien.</i>

1239
01:23:55,136 --> 01:23:58,103
But don't be too eager.

1240
01:23:58,105 --> 01:24:00,171
You come back Thursday night.

1241
01:24:00,173 --> 01:24:03,140
And we will see.

1242
01:24:03,142 --> 01:24:04,641
We'll see.

1243
01:25:45,477 --> 01:25:47,710
Get the hell off my property

1244
01:25:47,712 --> 01:25:49,478
before I cook you and eat you!

1245
01:25:55,185 --> 01:25:57,451
Is that you, pineapple thief?

1246
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:01,487
Come.

1247
01:26:14,768 --> 01:26:16,534
Mmm hmm...

1248
01:26:16,536 --> 01:26:19,169
I thought you was one
of those town kids,

1249
01:26:19,171 --> 01:26:21,104
always bothering me.

1250
01:26:26,677 --> 01:26:28,843
Is he dead yet?

1251
01:26:28,845 --> 01:26:30,477
How could he be dead?

1252
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:32,111
You didn't give me the doll.

1253
01:26:32,113 --> 01:26:34,580
What doll?

1254
01:26:34,582 --> 01:26:36,648
I didn't say nothing
to you about no doll.

1255
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:39,384
The... The voodoo doll.

1256
01:26:39,386 --> 01:26:42,120
I didn't make you
no voodoo doll.

1257
01:26:42,122 --> 01:26:44,489
I made you a wax coffin.

1258
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:48,226
I put his hair inside
the mouth of a snake,

1259
01:26:48,228 --> 01:26:50,695
buried it in the graveyard.

1260
01:26:50,697 --> 01:26:52,396
He should be dead by now.

1261
01:26:52,398 --> 01:26:55,399
I thought I had
to do something first,

1262
01:26:55,401 --> 01:26:58,168
like... like stick pins
in it or...

1263
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:59,636
you did something!

1264
01:26:59,638 --> 01:27:02,138
You brought me his hair.

1265
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:06,875
And you paid me $20.

1266
01:27:06,877 --> 01:27:09,577
But... I wanted it.

1267
01:27:09,579 --> 01:27:12,913
I wanted to have it.
I need it!

1268
01:27:12,915 --> 01:27:15,148
Oh, God.

1269
01:27:17,652 --> 01:27:19,485
Where...

1270
01:27:19,487 --> 01:27:21,720
Where'd you bury it?

1271
01:27:21,722 --> 01:27:24,222
Down there...

1272
01:27:24,224 --> 01:27:26,924
Where all them
batistes are buried.

1273
01:27:26,926 --> 01:27:29,693
But...

1274
01:27:29,695 --> 01:27:32,796
I don't think you'll find it.

1275
01:27:32,798 --> 01:27:36,466
You said you wanted him dead.

1276
01:27:36,468 --> 01:27:38,734
You said you were certain.

1277
01:27:44,507 --> 01:27:48,675
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1278
01:27:49,878 --> 01:27:51,844
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1279
01:28:32,684 --> 01:28:33,949
Daddy!

1280
01:28:33,951 --> 01:28:35,350
Oh, daddy!

1281
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:37,518
I'm so happy to see you!

1282
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,288
What you doing over here
this time of night?

1283
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:42,289
What's wrong?

1284
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:44,357
Is it<i> gran mére?</i>

1285
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:47,693
Um... Daddy,
let's go home.

1286
01:28:47,695 --> 01:28:50,829
Please, I want you
to come home with me.

1287
01:28:50,831 --> 01:28:52,330
Of course, baby.

1288
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:55,599
You walk all the way over here?

1289
01:28:55,601 --> 01:28:56,967
What's wrong?

1290
01:28:56,969 --> 01:28:59,269
Looks like you've
been busted, doc.

1291
01:28:59,271 --> 01:29:00,870
The last one's on me.

1292
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:05,006
Baby, go outside

1293
01:29:05,008 --> 01:29:06,807
while I say good night
to Mrs. mereaux.

1294
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:10,510
Hurry up.

1295
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:50,516
Oh, hey, Mr. mereaux.

1296
01:30:05,932 --> 01:30:06,931
Ahem.

1297
01:30:12,471 --> 01:30:13,603
Hey, baby.

1298
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:17,539
Hey, old man,

1299
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:19,407
you're just in time
to have a last one with us.

1300
01:30:19,409 --> 01:30:20,508
I don't think so, Louis.

1301
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:21,809
What's wrong with you, Lenny?

1302
01:30:21,811 --> 01:30:23,844
You crazy?

1303
01:30:23,846 --> 01:30:25,412
You fucking my wife?

1304
01:30:25,414 --> 01:30:27,781
Don't be ridiculous, Lenny.

1305
01:30:27,783 --> 01:30:29,015
You fucking her?

1306
01:30:29,017 --> 01:30:30,182
You're drunk.

1307
01:30:30,184 --> 01:30:31,883
You like her?

1308
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,618
She's very beautiful.

1309
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:36,586
Are you fucking her?

1310
01:30:36,588 --> 01:30:39,155
Lenny, Matty and I
are old friends.

1311
01:30:39,157 --> 01:30:41,123
You know that
as well as anyone.

1312
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:43,892
I trusted you, Louis.

1313
01:30:45,562 --> 01:30:47,161
And you've been fucking Matty.

1314
01:30:49,565 --> 01:30:52,866
I loved you, Louis.

1315
01:30:52,868 --> 01:30:54,901
I love you, Lenny.

1316
01:30:56,204 --> 01:30:57,603
Come on, daddy.
Let's go home.

1317
01:30:57,605 --> 01:30:58,604
That's right.

1318
01:30:58,606 --> 01:31:00,105
You're drunk, baby.

1319
01:31:00,107 --> 01:31:00,905
Let me take you home.

1320
01:31:00,907 --> 01:31:02,940
Listen...

1321
01:31:02,942 --> 01:31:07,777
You so much as speak
to my wife again...

1322
01:31:07,779 --> 01:31:09,812
And I will kill you.

1323
01:31:09,814 --> 01:31:11,914
Do you understand?

1324
01:31:13,117 --> 01:31:16,585
Gentlemen,
take it outside.

1325
01:31:16,587 --> 01:31:18,219
Let's get the hell out of here.

1326
01:31:36,004 --> 01:31:40,072
You go home and sleep off
that whiskey, old man.

1327
01:31:40,074 --> 01:31:42,140
You can apologize
to me tomorrow.

1328
01:31:43,676 --> 01:31:46,809
You speak to her again,
you're dead, Louis.

1329
01:31:48,245 --> 01:31:50,578
Come on, daddy.
Let's go home.

1330
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,513
Please? Come on.

1331
01:31:52,515 --> 01:31:54,248
Ok, baby.
Good night, Matty.

1332
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:03,622
No!

1333
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:09,093
Aah!

1334
01:32:09,095 --> 01:32:11,829
Aah!

1335
01:32:11,831 --> 01:32:14,565
No!

1336
01:32:18,804 --> 01:32:20,837
No, daddy!

1337
01:32:20,839 --> 01:32:22,205
Daddy!

1338
01:32:22,207 --> 01:32:24,774
No!

1339
01:32:41,225 --> 01:32:45,594
"Our father,
who art in heaven...

1340
01:32:45,596 --> 01:32:48,029
"Hallowed be thy name.

1341
01:32:48,031 --> 01:32:50,064
"Thy kingdom come,

1342
01:32:50,066 --> 01:32:52,166
"thy will be done

1343
01:32:52,168 --> 01:32:53,167
"on earth...

1344
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:56,235
"...as it is in heaven.

1345
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:57,202
Give us this day
our daily bread."

1346
01:32:57,204 --> 01:33:00,305
No!

1347
01:33:00,307 --> 01:33:03,007
"Forgive us our trespasses,

1348
01:33:03,009 --> 01:33:04,308
"as we forgive those

1349
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:07,044
"who have trespassed
against us.

1350
01:33:07,046 --> 01:33:10,047
"And lead us not
into temptation.

1351
01:33:10,049 --> 01:33:12,249
"But deliver us from evil,

1352
01:33:12,251 --> 01:33:14,918
"for thine is the kingdom

1353
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,219
"and the power

1354
01:33:16,221 --> 01:33:17,753
"and the glory

1355
01:33:17,755 --> 01:33:19,888
forever and ever."

1356
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:21,656
Amen.

1357
01:34:41,302 --> 01:34:45,137
Last night I had a dream
that I was flying.

1358
01:34:45,139 --> 01:34:47,973
It was such a fine feeling.

1359
01:34:47,975 --> 01:34:50,408
But from the corner of my eye,

1360
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:53,711
I saw a woman drowning

1361
01:34:53,713 --> 01:34:57,681
in the very same air
that was keeping me afloat.

1362
01:34:57,683 --> 01:35:00,917
And I knew without looking
that it was me.

1363
01:35:00,919 --> 01:35:03,085
Should I save her?

1364
01:35:04,655 --> 01:35:07,022
And then I heard Louis'
voice saying,

1365
01:35:07,024 --> 01:35:08,757
"don't look back."

1366
01:35:10,193 --> 01:35:12,760
So I kept on flying...

1367
01:35:13,963 --> 01:35:15,929
And I let her drown.

1368
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:23,069
When I woke up...

1369
01:35:24,772 --> 01:35:27,372
I told Julian
I would marry him.

1370
01:35:31,311 --> 01:35:34,078
He wouldn't have it
any other way.

1371
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,146
Maybe God will be kind

1372
01:35:36,148 --> 01:35:38,348
and allow me to go with him.

1373
01:35:38,350 --> 01:35:41,984
I'm so tired
of being left alone.

1374
01:35:48,892 --> 01:35:51,759
Your daddy gave me
a message for you.

1375
01:35:54,196 --> 01:35:57,931
"Tell Eve I still
owe her that dance."

1376
01:37:18,146 --> 01:37:20,546
"To Mozelle."

1377
01:37:29,089 --> 01:37:30,254
"Mozelle,

1378
01:37:30,256 --> 01:37:32,889
"it's been 2 hours
since we spoke,

1379
01:37:32,891 --> 01:37:34,390
and finally..."

1380
01:37:34,392 --> 01:37:36,458
I feel calm enough
to write this.

1381
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:38,526
I realize
that your accusations,

1382
01:37:38,528 --> 01:37:40,427
however shocking and cruel,

1383
01:37:40,429 --> 01:37:43,129
stem from some weakness
in myself

1384
01:37:43,131 --> 01:37:46,098
that allows you to believe
the worst of me.

1385
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,300
As you and I know,

1386
01:37:48,302 --> 01:37:50,101
I'm just
a small-town doctor

1387
01:37:50,103 --> 01:37:52,136
pushing aspirin to the elderly,

1388
01:37:52,138 --> 01:37:54,438
but to a certain type of woman,

1389
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,039
I'm a hero.

1390
01:37:56,041 --> 01:38:00,176
I need to be a hero sometimes.

1391
01:38:00,178 --> 01:38:03,946
That's my weakness,
that much is true.

1392
01:38:03,948 --> 01:38:05,447
But how, Mozelle,

1393
01:38:05,449 --> 01:38:07,449
could I have sunk
in your estimation

1394
01:38:07,451 --> 01:38:09,017
to the leechy depths

1395
01:38:09,019 --> 01:38:10,551
where you would accuse me

1396
01:38:10,553 --> 01:38:14,521
of deliberately abusing
my most beloved child?

1397
01:38:14,523 --> 01:38:17,357
I am guilty in the sense
that I adore her,

1398
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:20,993
and I allowed her to adore me.

1399
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:23,161
It was a sweet indulgence,

1400
01:38:23,163 --> 01:38:26,164
but nothing in her behavior
prepared me

1401
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:28,232
for what happened
on the night of the storm.

1402
01:38:29,535 --> 01:38:31,968
Roz and I had
a terrible fight,

1403
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:34,837
and I guess it was inevitable.

1404
01:38:34,839 --> 01:38:36,338
Roz!

1405
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:39,341
I knew cisely could never sleep
through a fight like that,

1406
01:38:39,343 --> 01:38:43,378
so I wasn't surprised
when she came downstairs.

1407
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:46,314
And maybe I was even
waiting for her.

1408
01:38:46,316 --> 01:38:49,216
I let myself wallow
in filial comfort.

1409
01:38:53,554 --> 01:38:55,587
Mozelle, I swear,

1410
01:38:55,589 --> 01:38:59,023
the first kiss
was the sweetest kiss

1411
01:38:59,025 --> 01:39:02,993
a daughter could give a drunk
and guilt-ridden father.

1412
01:39:02,995 --> 01:39:04,294
A kiss of redemption.

1413
01:39:09,234 --> 01:39:12,501
In the next moment,
it had gone wrong.

1414
01:39:12,503 --> 01:39:14,970
From my scotch haze,
it took me a second

1415
01:39:14,972 --> 01:39:19,240
to realize that my daughter
was kissing me like a woman.

1416
01:39:19,242 --> 01:39:20,975
This is where I blame myself.

1417
01:39:20,977 --> 01:39:22,276
Cisely, no!

1418
01:39:22,278 --> 01:39:24,144
I was so startled
that I hit her

1419
01:39:24,146 --> 01:39:25,645
and she fell to the floor.

1420
01:39:25,647 --> 01:39:28,881
The look she gave me
almost stopped my heart.

1421
01:39:28,883 --> 01:39:30,215
Oh, cisely.

1422
01:39:30,217 --> 01:39:32,150
And I knew I had lost her.

1423
01:39:32,152 --> 01:39:33,317
Baby. Baby, I'm sorry.

1424
01:39:33,319 --> 01:39:35,352
Mozelle, I would give my life

1425
01:39:35,354 --> 01:39:37,387
to have that moment back.

1426
01:39:37,389 --> 01:39:40,356
I would hold her
and comfort her.

1427
01:39:40,358 --> 01:39:42,057
We would talk
through her confusion,

1428
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:44,392
and I would put her to bed

1429
01:39:44,394 --> 01:39:47,161
with the boundaries
between us intact.

1430
01:39:47,163 --> 01:39:50,397
I love her more than my life.

1431
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:54,334
I hope that one day
she can forgive me.

1432
01:39:54,336 --> 01:39:57,036
I felt I could not
betray her again

1433
01:39:57,038 --> 01:39:59,438
by telling you or roslyn.

1434
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,273
Forgive me...

1435
01:40:01,275 --> 01:40:02,540
Liar!

1436
01:40:02,542 --> 01:40:04,909
Louis.

1437
01:40:04,911 --> 01:40:05,509
What?

1438
01:40:07,346 --> 01:40:10,313
You lied to me about daddy!

1439
01:40:10,315 --> 01:40:13,215
You lied!

1440
01:40:13,217 --> 01:40:15,317
Daddy wrote Mozelle a letter!

1441
01:40:15,319 --> 01:40:16,951
You lied!

1442
01:40:16,953 --> 01:40:18,652
I wasn't lying!

1443
01:40:18,654 --> 01:40:21,521
I believed you!

1444
01:40:21,523 --> 01:40:24,056
And I hated him.

1445
01:40:25,159 --> 01:40:27,392
I hated him for you.

1446
01:40:37,403 --> 01:40:39,636
He hurt me, Eve.

1447
01:40:39,638 --> 01:40:42,972
He hurt me...

1448
01:40:42,974 --> 01:40:45,074
So badly...

1449
01:40:45,076 --> 01:40:46,708
I wanted to die.

1450
01:40:55,618 --> 01:40:57,584
Tell me what happened.

1451
01:41:00,455 --> 01:41:01,720
Please!

1452
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:04,824
I have to know.

1453
01:41:04,826 --> 01:41:06,192
I can't.

1454
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:16,534
Please.

1455
01:41:47,866 --> 01:41:49,531
I don't know what happened.

1456
01:41:52,836 --> 01:41:54,769
I don't know.

1457
01:41:57,673 --> 01:41:58,672
It's ok.

1458
01:41:58,674 --> 01:41:59,739
I can't!

1459
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:05,142
I can't.

1460
01:42:05,144 --> 01:42:06,610
It's ok.

1461
01:42:06,612 --> 01:42:08,478
Shh... Shh... Shh...

1462
01:42:14,318 --> 01:42:16,718
The summer my father
said good night,

1463
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:19,520
I was 10 years old...

1464
01:42:19,522 --> 01:42:22,389
My brother poe was 9...

1465
01:42:22,391 --> 01:42:26,726
And my sister cisely
had just turned 14.

1466
01:42:30,398 --> 01:42:32,264
We are the descendants

1467
01:42:32,266 --> 01:42:35,834
of Eve and Jean Paul batiste.

1468
01:42:35,836 --> 01:42:37,635
I was named for her.

1469
01:42:42,774 --> 01:42:45,241
Like others before me...

1470
01:42:45,243 --> 01:42:47,476
I have the gift of sight.

1471
01:42:47,478 --> 01:42:51,813
But the truth changes color
depending on the light.

1472
01:42:51,815 --> 01:42:55,215
And tomorrow can be clearer
than yesterday.

1473
01:42:57,452 --> 01:43:00,753
Memory is a selection
of images...

1474
01:43:00,755 --> 01:43:02,521
Some elusive...

1475
01:43:02,523 --> 01:43:06,157
Others printed indelibly
on the brain.

1476
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:10,794
Each image is like a thread,
each thread woven together

1477
01:43:10,796 --> 01:43:14,264
to make a tapestry
of intricate texture.

1478
01:43:14,266 --> 01:43:17,166
And the tapestry tells a story.

1479
01:43:17,168 --> 01:43:19,334
And the story is our past.

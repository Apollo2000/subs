$5,000, sometimes $6,000 in a weekend.

He could bench-press, like, five of me.

As we started talking,
it became pretty clear

71
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,645
that the waitress that I was fucking
was the same waitress he was fucking.

72

about that, so, um...

- And why should I care?

for Sunset Boingo anymore.

00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,718
[Leandro] If you're that worried,
why are you here?

325
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,845
Go home, boss.

326
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,176
[Calvin] I just require clarity.

327
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,931
[Jo] Of course, Calvin.
It's a very valid question,

328
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,186
but why don't we just table that for now?

329
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,773
Er, and... is everybody ready?

330
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,944
Mmm. Sorry. It's not quite sweet enough.

331
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,202
Mmm.

332
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,033
- Much better.
- Fucking real?

333
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,622
[Krystal laughs]

334
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,541
[draws chair]

335
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,215
All good now?

336
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Mmm-hmm.

337
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,338
Welcome to KA.

338
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,055
My name is Jo.

339
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
[all] Hi, Jo.

340
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,059
We're all here
because we're not all there.

341
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,853
KA is an education without a graduation.

342
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,644
It's a place of listening and respect.

343
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,198
We all have another fumble in us...

344
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,827
but we don't know
if we have another recovery.

345
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,073
We were powerless over killing.

346
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,456
[all] We were powerless over killing.

347
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,918
Our lives had become unmanageable.

348
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:09,211
We came to believe
that a power greater than ourselves

349
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,513
could restore us to sanity.

350
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:18,600
We made a decision to turn our will
over to the care of KA.

351
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,561
We made a searching and fearless
moral inventory of ourselves,

352
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,448
admitted to ourselves
and to other human beings

353
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,151
the exact nature of our wrongs.

354
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,291
Having had a spiritual awakening
as a result of KA,

355
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:43,662
<i>we try to carry this message
to other killers,</i>

356
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:46,874
<i>and to practice these principles</i>

357
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,300
in all our affairs.

358
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,307
Fabulous.

359
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,513
Okay, who would like to go first?

360
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,603
I will.

361
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,895
[Jo] Ben, the room is yours.

362
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,439
- Thanks. Hi, everyone. My name is Ben.
- Hello, Ben.

363
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,142
And it has been 284 days
since my last kill.

364
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:07,946
[door opens]

365
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,897
[siren wailing]

366
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:25,079
Ben, please continue.

367
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,961
So, there was never any real doubt
what I'd be doing after school, I guess.

368
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,217
- 'Sup.
- [Leandro] Who the fuck says that shit?

369
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,310
[Markus] "'Sup."

370
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:40,895
'Sup, fucker.

371
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,085
Fucking do that again,
I'll smack you hard, man.

372
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,316
- [Markus laughs]
- Promise ya.

373
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,776
Markus, we've talked about this.

374
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,980
Well, I'm terribly sorry about that.

375
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,607
Maybe you should try locking your door.

376
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,698
Martial law going on up there.

377
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,833
Hello, Doctor.

378
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Thank you.

379
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,994
[groans] Sorry.

380
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,548
Okay, Ben. Please continue.

381
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:12,501
Yeah, Benny boy.

382
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,758
By all means, do continue.

383
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,133
- You done?
- Yeah.

384
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,728
So, I mean, I was a killer
even before I got to boot camp.

385
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,414
I served three tours, all in the desert,

386
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:29,731
and I saw and I did a lot of things
that I'll never forget.

387
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,569
Some things I'm not proud of,

388
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,272
maybe even most of them.

389
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,857
My first kill wasn't there.

390
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,911
My first kill was out in the woods
behind my best friend's house.

391
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,205
<i>I'd smelt gunpowder 100 times before,</i>

392
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,163
<i>but it seemed so much stronger that day.</i>

393
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,962
<i>Poured up into my nose, into my brain,</i>

394
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,627
<i>stayed with me for days.</i>

395
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,802
<i>For weeks, I had flashbacks, like a...</i>

396
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,630
<i>almost like a dream
you keep coming back to.</i>

397
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,724
[Markus] <i>Fuck off.</i>

398
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,516
A hunting accident.

399
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,645
You lost your cherry
on a fucking hunting accident.

400
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,144
Jesus Christ. Who is this guy?

401
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,651
Markus.

402
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,026
Fuck off.

403
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,284
I'll break your fucking jaw,
you little weaselly bastard.

404
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:27,083
[Jo] Markus, if you can't contribute
in a more constructive way,

405
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,411
then you're going to be banned
from the meetings.

406
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:30,791
[Markus] Don't try to tell me

407
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,281
you don't know what's going down
up in those fucking streets.

408
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,754
You've got the city's best
and brightest professionals

409
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,302
all down here
in this fucking dodgy basement with...

410
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,175
Who the fuck are you, for a start?

411
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,679
A whole city didn't take down
that senator.

412
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,972
Come on.

413
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,396
- I smell fucking shite in here.
- [Jo] Okay. All right.

414
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,936
Ben, please. Carry on.

415
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,186
- [Ben] Well, it wasn't an accident.
- [Markus] Prick.

416
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,200
- [gunshot]
- [Ben] <i>I'd never had a person there,</i>

417
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,908
<i>a human,
at the other end of my scope before.</i>

418
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,862
<i>I mean, he was my best friend,
for Christ's sake. I knew it was wrong.</i>

419
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,572
<i>It was the wrongest thing I'd ever done.</i>

420
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,159
<i>But it didn't feel wrong.</i>

421
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,586
[Jo] <i>What did it feel like?</i>

422
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,706
[Ben] <i>Like waking up.</i>

423
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,881
[Calvin] <i>Why did you do it?</i>

424
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,634
I couldn't tell you.

425
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,429
- [Leandro] What did you do with the body?
- I buried it.

426
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,285
Not because I was worried
about getting caught.

427
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,642
Honestly, I waited for weeks
for the police to show up,

428
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,390
but no one ever came.

429
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,064
[chuckles] I even thought about
what it would be like to go to prison.

430
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,770
[Markus] Oh, my God. They would fucking
love you in prison, wouldn't they?

431
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:41,324
[Ben] <i>Anyway, so I even got excited
about the idea of killing again.</i>

432
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:42,908
<i>I wanted to share.</i>

433
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,244
[Calvin] <i>Then why bury him?</i>

434
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,573
Sounds s-stupid.

435
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,084
[Jo] It's okay.

436
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,703
[Ben] <i>I wanted to thank him.</i>

437
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:58,918
[laughs] For fuck's sake. Ben, come on.

438
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,282
- Seriously, what is she even doing here?
- Come on, the kid's a fucking pussy.

439
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:04,923
[Jo] Krystal, please engage.

440
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,601
[Ben] Anyway, after that, I enlisted.
I lived for that kill shot.

441
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,351
Problem is, you do that long enough,
you forget how to live for anything else.

442
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,476
They made me very good at one thing.

443
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:21,361
When the tour came to an end,
they told me to go home, put it away.

444
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,871
So I got this fucking itch.

445
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,416
It's with me every day.

446
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,212
Some days I don't scratch it
and some days...

447
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,425
some days, I do.

448
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,753
Okay. All right, guys.
Thank you, Ben, for sharing.

449
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,180
[all] Thank you, Ben.

450
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,474
[Jo] That was... Yes, Markus?

451
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,804
Who the fuck is she?

452
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,439
[sighs]

453
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:59,189
[Jo] Well, I suggest we take ten minutes
and collect our thoughts

454
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,236
and hopefully we'll find out
when we come back.

455
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,610
- [man yawns]
- [Markus] Would anybody like some coffee?

456
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,650
[Leandro] I'm going for a cig.

457
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,384
[Krystal] I can't wait to hear her story.

458
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,932
[Markus] Yeah, that'll be interesting.

459
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,663
[eerie music]

460
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:16,419
[Leandro] You having one?

461
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,001
Sure.

462
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,210
- Character, isn't she?
- Who?

463
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,306
Krystal.

464
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,307
I saw you looking at her in there.

465
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,310
Can't figure out what you were thinking.

466
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,352
Kinda looked like she amused ya.

467
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,557
[lighter flicks]

468
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:40,234
She just reminds me of someone I know.

469
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
Yeah?

470
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,655
You don't strike me as the kind to get
close to people who are batshit crazy.

471
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,372
I'm here, aren't I?

472
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,537
My point.

473
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,087
So what do you think about everyone else?

474
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,510
I don't really know what to think.

475
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,337
We're all batshit crazy.

476
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,264
You should've left
when you had the chance.

477
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,759
Thought definitely crossed my mind.

478
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:18,015
Two failed attempts to take out
that fucking senator in one night.

479
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,020
<i>It's a fucking embarrassment.</i>

480
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,022

Excuse me?

Yeah.

Share what?

493
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,763
In the meeting. Share your story.

494
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,472
Might not fix it, but it'll help.

495

Yeah.

This has just been

My name is Calvin and I am a killer.

535
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,134
[Jo] Hello, Calvin.

536
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,897
Many years ago, when I was a young man,

537
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,318
my wife and I were involved
in a car accident.

538
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,940
- [tires screech]
- [crash]

539
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,523
I was trapped in the seat beside her.

540
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,193
I had to watch her die.

541
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,206
It was...

542
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:09,917
beautiful.

543
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:22,091
To date, I have lost 34 patients,

544
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,513
not to illness or trauma,

545
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,351
but for the simple reason
that I wanted to watch them die.

546
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,606
I do not walk around killing people.

547
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,358
I do not get paid to do it.

548
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,357
I am a doctor.

549
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:44,071
I have an oath that I'm sworn to uphold.

550
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,162
"Do no harm."

551
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,709
Sometimes you have to do harm
in order to do good.

552
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,706
Sometimes you have to cut off a limb
in order to save the body.

553
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:03,928
So that we might witness the transition.

554
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:07,552
Transition?

555
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,390
The transition to the inert.

[clears throat]

what I allow to happen,

568
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,815
is my way of conquering that fear.

569
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,903
Thank you, Calvin.

570
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,781
[all] Thank you, Calvin.

571
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:14,825
Okay. Next, I would like to try something,
if no one objects.

572
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,409
Um, an exercise.

573
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:24,258
Perhaps something that might help us deal
with the everyday stresses we all face.

574
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,005
I'd like to hear about...

575
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,546
the last time...

576
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,600
you thought about killing someone.

577
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,860
Right, I'll go.

578
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,729
I'm Leo and I'm a killer.

579
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,939
[all] Hello, Leo.

580
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,115
It was this morning,
the shop down the road from me.

581
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,110
I've got a soy milk maker.

582
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,287
- So once a week, I go and restock.
- A what?

583
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,454
A soy milk maker. I make me own soy milk.

584
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,751
Why?

585
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,681
Because it's a healthier
alternative to lactose

586
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,001
and it's easier and quicker to make
than you might think.

587
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,212
[grunting]

588
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,349
Okay.

589
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:13,970
Soy milk.

590
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,602
Gotcha.

591
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,348
[Leandro] Anyway...

592
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,313
so I go to restock on the beans.

593
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,561
I go in down the first aisle,
next to the artisanal breads,

594
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:30,199
and there's this old lady there
with these gaudy fucking rings on,

595
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,779
ten coats of makeup
and this bushy unibrow,

596
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,705
taking up the last of them fucking beans.

597
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,160
I want to strangle her from behind,

598
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:45,798
garrote her with me shoelace,
but I thought, "No, that ain't right."

599
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,630
I want to watch the life
drain out of her eyes...

600
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,760
put me hands around her chubby neck,

601
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,304
squeeze her and see her puff

602
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,183
and sweat that mascara
right out of her fat fucking face.

603
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,766
Or stab her in her armpit.

604
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,393
[chuckles]

605
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,977
A lot of people don't know
there's a nerve cluster there.

606
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:12,153
And then I'll just watch her piss herself
right there in the bakery section.

607
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,319
All because of soybeans.

608
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,950
Stupid shit, really.

609
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,116
Everybody thinks it sometimes.

610
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,505
Just out on the motorway

611
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,708
or standing in the queue
at the supermarket.

612
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,255
The only difference
is that I could've done it.

613
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,349
I have done it.

614
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,051
I wanted to do it, but I didn't.

615
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,559
It took everything I had,
but I didn't do it.

616
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,359
[Jo] Leo... Leo, it's important
to know our triggers.

617
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,092
[Ben] What was your first kill?

618
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,182
What?

619
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,098
- [Ben] Your first kill.
- [spits]

620
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,843
I can't remember.

621
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,476
- [Ben] Come on.
- I don't know.

622
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,567
We all have a first one, though.

623
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,855
I'll tell you the first one I felt.

624
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:33,949
Lady Ming.

625
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,157
[Krystal] Are you kidding?

626
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,070
You killed Ming?

627
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,955
Oh, you kept that quiet, didn't you,
you sneaky son of a bitch?

628
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,877
[Markus] I fucking knew it.

629
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:51,002
I fucking knew it.

630
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:56,679
Only a professional
could've taken down that evil old cow.

631
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,881
You know, everyone said it was cancer.

632
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,809
I'm actually mildly impressed.

633
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,432
The bosses still call me that too,
the fucking cancer.

634
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,024
Like it's clever.

635
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,734
- How did you do it?
- Poison.

636
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,363
For that to pass
as something other than poison,

637
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,863
the doses would have to be small.

638
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,662
It would have to be done
over a period of weeks, months.

639
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,364
Seventy-two weeks, four days.

640
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,083
- How did you get access?
- She was my godmother.

641

00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:51,901
<i>become godmother
to some low-rent enforcer?</i>

643
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,266
[Leandro] <i>That wasn't the story.</i>

644
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,278
[Krystal] <i>Well, let's make it the story.</i>

645
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,572
<i>How the fuck did no one know?</i>

646
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,070
[Leandro] <i>'Cause I was good at me job.</i>

647
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,696
<i>I worked years for that family.</i>

648
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,625
<i>When you love what you do,
you never work a day in your life.</i>

649
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,202
<i>I worked every fucking day.</i>

650
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,215
<i>I was good at it.</i>

651
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,916
<i>I did what I had to do.</i>

652
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,302
<i>I just didn't know I'd have to do so much.</i>

653
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,432
<i>The job's killing.</i>

654
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,351
<i>I'm not under any illusion about that.</i>

655
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,722
<i>But what I didn't know until Ming...</i>

656
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,474
<i>it's not about killing them.</i>

657
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,737
<i>It's about how many times
we have to kill ourselves to do it.</i>

658
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:42,151
<i>Or how many times it takes what's best
about you and fucking rips it out.</i>

659
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,788
<i>And the worst part is,
it never really dies.</i>

660
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,041
<i>I wish it would.</i>

661
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,585
<i>Would make it so much easier.</i>

662
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:57,921
<i>But itjust sits there,
the best part of you, sick and hurting.</i>

663
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,219
<i>And every time you think it's gone...</i>

664
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,558
<i>every time you think you can't die
inside anymore, you fucking do.</i>

665
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,970
<i>And then it feels like
the first time all over again.</i>

666
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,021
[Jo] Okay, let's thank Leandro

<i>You're the only one who helps me.</i>

In a calm manner, nice and controlled.

678

<i>I don't feel in control.</i>

679
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,595
Now tell me, what kicked it off?

680
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,930
What was your trigger?

681
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:56,313
[sighs] <i>I was just making a sandwich.</i>

682

I was calmly making a controlled sandwich.

V, are you pacing?

684
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,618
Picture my face.

685
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,821
Sit down.

686
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,247
<i>Yeah, fine.</i>

Okay.

Back to the sandwich.

689
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:16,496
Can I ask you a question?
What kind of sandwich were you making?

690
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,627
[woman] Chicken.

691
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:24,678
Yeah. Yeah. It's classic.
It's the bones, innit?

692
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,676
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

693
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,635
I really wish
there was more information available,

694
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,142
but, unfortunately, the funding...

695
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,100
Well, it simply isn't there.

696
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:41,687
As your sponsor,
I should have had the foresight

697
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,738
to have warned you
about the chicken thing.

698

Next time, buy fillets.

I liked what you said.

703
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,588
It was a good story.

704
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,848
Yeah, I've also been thinking a lot
about what you said earlier.

705

They're a fucked-up bunch,

but who better to listen
to how fucked-up you are

Well, fuck off back downstairs then, Ben.

Which hospital was it
you said you worked at again?

The Royal Bridge.

Oh, no reason.

[Ben] You were a drama queen
at school, right?

727
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,601
[Krystal] Actually, Ben, I was the queen
of fucking everything at school.

[Leandro] She means she was a slag.

Can't we come together for just one night

732
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:58,825
and put the ego and posturing
and one-upmanship aside?

You know, listening and respect.

737
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:38,114
[Markus] I think all you guys do
is talk in fucking monologues

738
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:42,201
and I feel I'm stuck on a rooftop
with a bunch a dodgy Bond villains.

- [Jo] Who?
- [Krystal] Or her.

743

[Jo] Who?

744
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,631
[Leandro] Whoever killed the senator.

745
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,811
[Krystal] Yeah, Jo, I think
the no-phone rule is about to go bust.

746
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,516

I would hope so, Joanna.

Ask her.

00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,869
You know him?

765
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,746
[Ben] You mind us asking how?

766
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:10,080
The guy was supposed to miss, right?
That was the plan.

767
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,631
So what the fuck happened?

768
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,208
[Markus] I'm kinda thinking that too.

769
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,127
What the fuck's going on?

770
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,133
[Krystal] He just asked you
a fucking question.

- No, no, no, nothing changed.

00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,756
- Get away from me.
- Well, I can take a look.

800
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:42,993
[Krystal]
Ben, what the fuck are you doing?

801
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,017
I'm helping.

802
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,387
[Krystal] Why?

803
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,015
- What do you mean why?
- You're not a fucking doctor.

804
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,596
- I thought maybe...
- Just get off.

805
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,232
Oh!

806
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,226
Calvin.

807
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,527
You are.

808
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:56,694
Fix the man.

809
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,521
- No. I'm fine.
- Yes, of course.

810
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,456
[Leandro] Then it doesn't hurt
for him to look.

811
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,071
[Calvin] You need stitches.

812
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:06,997
A needle and thread.
There's a first-aid kit upstairs.

813
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,251
I'll go.

814
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,456
That's deep.

815
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:17,791
Should we even be doing this?

816
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,178
[Ben] Doing what?

817
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,712
The guy's supposed to be dead.

818
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:27,934
[Calvin] But he is not.
He is here and he is wounded.

819
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,016
He should be there and dead.

820
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:34,733
So they're gonna be looking for him.

821
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,356
They don't need to look
because they are the CIA

822
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:39,403
and they weren't supposed
to hit me at all.

823
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,948
But I guess someone
didn't get that memo tonight.

824
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,034
[Leandro] The CIA?

825
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:45,447
This is some dark shit.

826
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,704
I promise you, John, nothing changed.

827
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,283
- The plan was still the plan.
- Not for everyone.

828
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,619
- Well, I had no idea.
- Really?

829
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:57,001
The breaking news report
that Senator John Kyle of California

830
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,423
had been assassinated

831
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:01,877
wasn't a clue that maybe something tonight
had gone upside down?

832
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:05,463
Really sorry. Can you go back
to the bit about the CIA, please?

833
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,640
- [Senator Kyle] What?
- Well, you said CIA,

834
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,388
as in the Central Intelligence Agency?

835
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,094
- Yes.
- John.

836
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,388
[Leandro] As in the Central fucking
Intelligence Agency.

837
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,440
Why, you don't know?

838
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,482
- [Leandro] Know what?
- John.

839
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,019
Who do you think runs these meetings?

840
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,321
[Ben] So CIA runs KA?

841
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:23,866
John.

842
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,114
Who did you think ran this?

843
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,536
[all] Jo.

844
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,954
Same thing.

845
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,327
[Ben] You're CIA.

846
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,210
Thanks a lot, John.

847
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,959
What I wanna know is
why you even called this meeting tonight.

848
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:39,799
[Markus] Thank you.

849
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,590
Did I not fucking tell you?

850
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:44,239
- Did I not fucking tell you?
- Markus, why don't you shut the fuck up?

851
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:45,365
- [Markus] Fuck off.
- [thunder rumbles]

852
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,449
[Leandro] Oh, fucking brilliant.

853
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,807
[Jo] Okay. Okay.
Everyone calm down. Let's get some light.

854
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,148
<i>Come on, boys and girls. Gather round.</i>

855
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,066
[Calvin] <i>Everybody must listen to Jo.</i>

856
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:05,364
Hmm.

857
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,789
Do I work for the CIA?

858
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,210
Yes, I do.

859
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,204
<i>And so do all of you.</i>

860
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,665
Sorry. How's that?

861
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,095
Hmm.

862
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,762
284 days ago, Sergei Rokmenonov

863
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:33,719
was skipping across Red Square
on his way to work.

864
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,144
The Ministry of Justice.

865
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,892
[man whistling]

866
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,315
Never made it to work that morning

867
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,688
because 650 yards
from the Ministry building,

868
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,219
- he was shot and killed.
- [gunshot]

869
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:47,149
You know how I know it was 650 yards?

870
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,360
Because that's the optimum range
for an SV-9 sniper rifle.

871
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:54,030
Isn't that right, Ben?

872
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,956
See, I'm not just a pretty face.

873
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:58,793
And then two days later,

874
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,246
a secure payment
was made to a bank account.

875
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,880
And the only two people who know
the exact amount of that payment

876
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,257
are the owner of the bank account

877
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,761
and the person
that authorized the transfer.

878
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,100
So, Ben,

879
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:20,683
if I were to say that £150,000
turned up in your bank account

880
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:23,359
two days after Rokmenonov
was killed in Moscow...

881
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,986
would you say
that was just a fantastic guess

882
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,492
or would I know something?

883
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,365
Well, that wasn't the CIA.

884
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,287
Ah, Ben.

885
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:36,910
It wasn't. It was Steven Sim...

886
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,868
Yes, Steven Sims from
the Alistair Holdings Group, yes.

887
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:44,127
But who do you think
Mr. Sims and AHG work for?

888
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:47,505
God, the cute ones are always so thick,
aren't they, Calvin?

889
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,630
[chuckles]

890
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:53,097
And two years ago,
a patient was rushed to the Royal Bridge,

891
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,300
complaining of chest pains
and blurry vision.

892
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:56,635
[siren wailing]

893
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,186
And you were the only resident
on call that night,

894
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,981
so of course you found the swollen aorta,

895
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,729
but you didn't do anything about it.

896
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:04,855
[labored breathing]

897
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:08,609
You just waited and watched,

898
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,157
as we knew you would.

899
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,529
[machine beeping]

900
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,905
And it was...

901
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:16,831
beautiful.

902
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,365
[beeping intensifies]

903
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,621
And eight hours later,
the patient was dead.

904
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,248
[monitor flatlines]

905
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,876
Now he happened to be
the head of the Armenian Rite

906
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,299
who was threatening to expose
certain agency contracts

907
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,968
in exchange for immunity
from the Ministry of Justice,

908
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,138
so you really helped us out
on that one, Calvin.

909
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,465
[Jo and Calvin chuckle]

910
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:42,606
And then, 11 months ago,
Michelle Huang Ming died of cancer...

911
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,026
after having been poisoned,

912
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,564
but before she was able to sell
certain classified information

913
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,991
to the Ministry of State Security
in China.

914
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,827
Ming was a double agent.

915
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,406
Leandro, I know this broke your heart...

916
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,751
but you helped us clean house.

917
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:10,175
And £200,000. Not bad.

918
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:17,932
And then, only last week,
our own Marky Marky Markus over here,

919
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,511
he put a bullet in the eyeball
of Officer Harold Morano,

920
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,437
who was here holidaying with his wife.

921
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,604
Officer Morano was about to give
a deposition at a trial

922
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,936
that would eventually have linked
the new Medellin Cartel

923
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,147
to certain agency operatives.

924
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,825
Yeah, you thought the hit
came from your brother.

925
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:39,537
He thought it came from Tyson Mulbury.
And Mulbury thought it came from...

926
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:41,916
You get the idea.

927
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,704
£18,000.

928
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,913
Love how cheap you street boys are.

929
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,463
Fuck you.

930
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,006
Fuck you, too.

931
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,629
[laughs]

932
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,239
[Leandro] What about Krystal?

933
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,505
Mmm? Krystal?

934
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,636
I don't have to tell Krystal
who Krystal works for,

935
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,594
because Krystal has known all along
who Krystal works for.

936
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:08,100
Just as I have known all along,
thanks to these meetings.

937
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:14,606
How to get each and every one of you
to do exactly what needed to be done.

938
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,659
Everyone, that is...

939
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,540
except you.

940
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:29,712
This was the biggest operation
that we'd planned for eight months.

941
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:32,415
We'd practiced, we'd rehearsed,
and still something went wrong.

942
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:36,715
Someone gave you a where and a when

943
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,218
and told you to say the word "Pisces."

944
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:41,303
And so, here you are,

945
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,140
and you're the only one I haven't met.

946
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,230
So, as you can imagine,

947
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,977
I'm really looking forward
to hearing your story.

948
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,854
[phone buzzing]

949
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,490
Christ.

950
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,323
- Hello, V.
- [Violet] <i>Stop cutting me off.</i>

951
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,113
I'm starting to get a picture here.

952
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,533
Has this girl...

953
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,915
Has this girl done anything to upset you

954
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:15,751
or have you just taken a disliking to her
for another reason?

955
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:21,636
Is there a logical explanation
as to why you want to cause her pain?

956
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,103
Yes, there's a reason.

957
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,272
<i>Did you notjust hear

The threat levels are high.

You're in fight mode to protect yourself.

And you feel if this girl wasn't around,

that you would feel better about yourself

you find it very hard to avoid her.

You know,
I had exactly the same thing with my wife.

975
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,573
Really, you've gotta trust me.
I've been there.

976
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:29,909
As I pointed that gun at my wife's face,
I said, "Any last words, Heather?"

977
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,711

It was a joke. You get it?</i>

"Last words." "Three hours." Talks a lot.

I know, darling. I'm so sorry.

Violet, you have to think about
the long-term consequences.

You have to be in control of your destiny.

Not exclusively.

01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,618
[Ben] What does that mean?

1062
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,822
- It means not exclusively.
- [Markus] But how does it work?

1063
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,993
Why? Why us?

1064
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:45,046

1065

[Ben] What type?

1069
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:56,678
Your personality profile.

1070
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,179
Why would she get flagged?

1071

eat my dinner off of the floor.

Those nights were always the worst
when he would get me alone,

and even though we went
to the same school,

1089
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,650
I was older,
so her class had to stay behind.

I knew,

1096
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,466
and all I could think to myself was,
"Alice, how could you have left her here?"

1097

<i>But touching her...</i>

1100

Touching her was too much.

And I didn't even know if I could do it.

1103

You know, I wanted to,
but I didn't actually think that I could,

1104
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:27,242
because I was small and he was...
Oh, goddamn, he was so big.

1105

<i>But I wasn't shaking.</i>

1106

I wasn't scared. It wasn't hard.

1107
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,634
It was easy.

1108
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,259
It's just been way too easy on me.
I wanted him to fight.

1109
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:45,343
I wanted him to make me work for it.
Throw me up against a wall.

wanting to do it again.</i>

1113
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,285
Do you still want it?

1114
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,327
What?

1115
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:10,242
Do you still want to kill?

1116
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,255
Every single day.

1117
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,587
I think we all know why you're here.

1118
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:20,253
[sighs]

1119
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,053
- I don't.
- I don't.

1120
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:23,801
I fucking don't.

1121
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:24,927
Come on.

1122
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,684
Jo, if anyone needs group, this girl does.

1123
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:29,933
Mmm, yes. I agree.

1124
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,419
And that would be great,
if this was group, but this is not group.

1125
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:34,729
I've just explained that.

1126
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,061
There's no fantasy world
where murderers meet in a church

1127
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:38,835
and exchange their philosophies
on killing.

1128
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:40,785
This is a place
for maintaining contract killers.

1129
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,450
I thought we were in this place to...

1130
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:44,947
So I ask again.

1131
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,033
What is she doing here?

1132
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,665
This girl is not a contract killer.

1133
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:55,084
- So what is she doing here?
- Whoa, whoa. Jo. Jo.

1134
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,256
Calm down.

1135
01:08:57,342 --> 01:09:00,210
Uh, what about the no-weapons policy?

1136
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,387
- [Jo] This is my insurance policy.
- [Krystal] Jo. Jo.

1137
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,510
I hate to agree with Ben,
but think about it.

1138
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,119
[Senator Kyle] If you think
she has something to do with this,

1139
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,143
then you must do what...

1140
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,640
Go to hell, John! You're not my boss.

1141
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,562
Today was a mess,
and that's the end of it.

1142
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:15,938
Jade messed up
and Krystal went in to sort it out,

1143
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,063
as per our orders.

1144
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,873
So that's why she ain't here tonight,
is it?

1145
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,321
You horrible bitch.

1146
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:24,070
And that's who they found across town,
I'm guessing, yeah?

1147
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:27,282
She was just doing her job.
It's not her fault that Jade fucked up.

1148
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:29,238
You wanna blame anyone,
you can blame Jade.

1149
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:32,951
<i>And as far as I knew, that was it.
The mission failed.</i>

1150
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:36,378
A new date would be set with a new shooter
who would miss as planned.

1151
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:40,083
So, John,
who actually shot you is anyone's guess.

1152
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,169
But I still think that
she had something to do with it.

1153
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:53,641
[muffled sneeze]

1154
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:54,731
Bless you.

1155
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,651
You.

1156
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:04,398
Stay right... there.

1157
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,535
That goes for the rest of you.

1158
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,286
[door rattling]

1159
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,580
Well, hello.

1160
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,582
Don't be scared. Just come on out.

1161
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:19,358
- [girl] Please. Get away from me.
- [Jo] Come on out.

1162
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,874
- All right.
- Come here, you. Hello.

1163
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,848
What you doing in there,
you little fucking rat?

1164
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,906
- [Senator Kyle] Fantastic.
- [Krystal] The plot thickens.

1165
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,887
[Jo] Okay, with all due respect, Krystal...

1166
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,057
Okay.

1167
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:33,098
[chuckles] Talk.

1168
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:35,975
No, no, no. We are not doing anything
to this little girl.

1169
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,397
[Senator Kyle] Just do it.

1170
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:41,067
- I'm sorry, Senator, do you have children?
- That has nothing to do with it.

1171
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,066
- Down.
- Okay, all right, okay.

1172
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:45,318
Everybody just stop, stop, stop.

1173
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:46,899
Everybody needs to be calm.

1174
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:50,077
There's just way, way, way,
way too much going on right now.

1175
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:51,279
Okay, Alice, move.

1176
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,126
Move.

1177
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,539
All those in favor...

1178
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,630
raise your hands.

1179
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:02,585
One, two, three, four.

1180
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:05,084
I know what's happening here.

1181
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:09,422
If you can assemble this gun
by the time Markus gets to the table,

1182
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,223
then you know what,
you get to have it your way.

1183
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:15,018
- I don't do this. This is...
- [Markus] You can do it.

1184
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,187
- Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
- Okay, Alice. Come on.

1185
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,605
Stop shaking. Stop shaking.

1186
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:22,685
[Markus] One more.
And then I'm coming for you, darling.

1187
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:25,478
[Leandro] Fucking try it, boss.

1188
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,907
[Markus] You gonna shoot me? Fuck you.

1189
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,406
You want some of this? Huh?

1190
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:33,991
Come on, then.

1191
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,122
[grunting]

1192
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,045
- [bones crack]
- [screaming]

1193
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,261
Get up.

1194
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,306
Both of you.

1195
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:55,134
Sweetheart, are you okay?

1196
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,562
[Jo] Okay, I just had to make sure
that she was just who she said she was

1197
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,435
and not a professional killer.

1198
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:01,685
Sweetheart, what's your name?

1199
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:05,648
Look, it's okay.

1200
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,480
Morgan.

1201
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,656
Nice to meet you, Morgan.
My name is Alice.

1202
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,222
[Senator Kyle] Just get to the point.

1203
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:13,433
I just need you to be honest with me.

1204
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,370
Morgan, what are you doing here?

1205
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:17,660
[Morgan] I got in a bit of trouble.

1206
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,533
[Alice] Okay, so then you hid here.

1207
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,056
Did you hear anything
that happened tonight?

1208
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,669
I did hear it.

1209
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:29,835
I heard all of it.

1210
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,137
[Senator Kyle] Well, that's it, then.
We have no choice.

1211
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,839
A rat is a problem we don't need.

1212
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:36,596
Okay. Whoa. Wait. Hey, come on.

1213
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:37,746
[Senator Kyle]
Joanna, she heard everything.

1214
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,957
Yeah, exactly. She just heard
a bunch of people talking.

1215
01:12:39,981 --> 01:12:42,564
She didn't see anyone do anything,
now did she, okay?

1216
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,188
So everyone's just gonna come now
and sit down and be calm.

1217
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:46,862
Come on.

1218
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,855
Now! Come on!

1219
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,691
- Shit.
- Don't touch her.

1220
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:01,792
[Markus] Hey!

1221
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:02,878
[Leandro] Come here.

1222
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,416
[indistinct chatter]

1223
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:13,921
Hey. Okay, okay.

1224
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,553
The last thing... Okay?

1225
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:20,094
The last thing our Morgan here
wants to do is upset anyone, right?

1226
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,645
I mean, you're a smart girl.

1227
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:25,315
You know that no one would believe
such a crazy story.

1228
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,854
Look, we are not trusting a kid.

1229
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:32,030
She's gonna speak.

1230
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,108
Maybe not at first, Jo,

1231
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:36,318
but one day, she's gonna talk to a friend

1232
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,871
or she's gonna go to confession
and she will speak.

1233
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,119
I won't. I swear.

1234
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:46,453
You'll fucking speak, all right.
You shut your little bitch mouth.

1235
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:47,913
Markus, she's just a kid, man.

1236
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,169
I know she's just a kid,

1237
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,218
but that little bitch
is gonna bring all of us down.

1238
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:56,172
And I kinda like my life.
I got shit to do.

1239
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,551
Killing her is not the solution.

1240
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,259
Like Joanna said,
the situation is so ridiculous,

1241
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:01,685
nobody will ever believe her.

1242
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,387
- [all arguing]
- All be quiet!

1243
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,347
- [Markus] Hey!
- [Jo] Jesus Christ!

1244
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,558
Morgan, stop it. Shit.

1245
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,796
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!
- [Alice] Don't come any closer. Stay back!

1246
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,340
[Krystal] Jo, give me the fucking gun.

1247
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:12,900
Calm down.

1248
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:14,366
[gunshot]

1249
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,066
Shit!

1250
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,026
- Fuck.
- [Krystal] Sorry, it was an accident.

1251
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,407
- [Markus] Krystal!
- [Krystal] No. Fuck.

1252
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,457
Move!

1253
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,077
Everyone fucking move!

1254
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,251
Get back inside.

1255
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:36,469
Krystal, I need to take a look at Jo.

1256
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:40,390
No. I said get back inside now!

1257
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,593
I need to look at her.
I need to look at Jo.

1258
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:44,873
- [Krystal] Calvin, shut up. Get inside.
- I need to get over there.

1259
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,729
- No!
- [Krystal] Fucking move.

1260
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,478
No, I need to get over there.

1261
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,683
Move!

1262
01:14:49,777 --> 01:14:51,609
[yelling continues]

1263
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,366
Huh.

1264
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,122
[door opens]

1265
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,007
Well, that changes things.

1266
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,056
Don't you agree?

1267
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:22,887
Don't you agree?

1269
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,687
- Alice.
- [whimpers]

1270
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,230
Alice, what are you doing, love?

1271
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:30,352
Hey. Fucking leave 'em.

1272
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:33,653
[Alice] Think about it.

1273
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,108
[Morgan grunting]

1274
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,656
I'm doing what has to be done.

1275
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,406
You think she's gonna keep quiet
after what she just saw?

1276
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,616
And then we're all supposed
to go down for it?

1277
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:49,959
No. I've got a family.

1278
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,663
And I'm not losing them
because of somebody else's actions.

1279
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:54,544
- [gasping]
- [Senator Kyle] She's right.

1280
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,841
Alice, let me do it.
You're not made for it.

1281
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:59,595
[Leandro] I've been in some
fucked-up situations...

1282
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:03,716
[Krystal] Okay. Okay, do you know what?
Fuck it. Let's make it interesting.

1283
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:06,768
Let's see who wants to do it.
Markus, you wanna have a go?

1284
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:10,222
Yeah, I'm fucking happy to do it.
Sure. Put the fucking gun down.

1285
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:13,399
Benny boy, why don't you
have a fucking go?

1286
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:15,944
I told you, I'm not having
any part of killing a kid.

1287
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,362
Noted.

1288
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:18,448
Calvin?

1289
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:23,572
"Noted"?

1290
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:28,206
No, absolutely not.
I'm not killing a child.

1291
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:34,129
For fuck's sake, Calvin, she's barely
a fucking child. She's what, 14?

1292
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:35,706
Hey, how old are you?

1293
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,258
[Leandro] Alice, Alice,
what's the crack here, love?

1294
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,045
How about you let Morgan go,
we have a bit of a chat,

1295
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:42,755
make some rational decisions?

1296
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,682
[Krystal] Why don't you just fucking
shut up and let her finish?

1297
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,931
[grunting]

1298
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:12,085
You okay?

1299
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:18,582
Let's get back to business.

1300
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,713
What are you doing, love?
This isn't you. [groans]

1301
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,301
You've got no idea who I am, Leo.

1302
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:29,638
Who the fuck are you?

1303
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:31,855
[Jo] She...

1304
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,306
is the new boss.

1305
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:35,982
Fuck off.

1306
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:38,403
[Senator Kyle] Joanna?

1307
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,487
[Jo laughs]

1308
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:43,658
Jo, what the fuck?

1309
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,574
Krystal, I knew that you would understand.

1310
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,904
Fucking dickhead.

1311
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,832
[Jo chuckles]

1312
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,126
Joanna, I demand to know...

1313
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,453
[gunshots]

1314
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:58,879
[Markus] Fuck!

1315
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,633
Blanks. Of course.

1316
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,677
Sorry about the dramatics.

1317
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:05,879
[pounding on door]

1318
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:09,883
You expecting somebody, Joanna?

1319
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,386
Christ, they found me.

1320
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,095
Somebody protect me. I can pay.

1321
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,306
Everything's for sale, right?

1322
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,644
Oh, God. Hold your breath, John.
No one's interested.

1323
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:25,073
It's probably cops doing door-to-door.
I'll go and take care of it.

1324
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:27,993
And then when I'm back,
everything will be explained.

1325
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:30,288
Everything.

1326
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:47,472
It's time.

1327
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:50,257
Don't hurt the girls.

1328
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:00,475
Okay. They have gone.

1329
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:07,694
All right, everybody.

1330
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:10,534
First question.

1331
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,487
Why not just kill me?

1332
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,789
That's what all of this
is about, right? Me?

1333
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,292
That was my fault.

1334
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:24,419
[cheering]

1335
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:50,283
Ah, can't get the shot.

1336
01:19:50,369 --> 01:19:52,986
Jade was supposed to shoot you
and not miss.

1337
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:54,664
Excuse me?

1338
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:57,417
[Jo] <i>But she messed up.</i>

1339
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,242
<i>So I blew the dust off the old Dragunov</i>

1340
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,543
and stepped in myself.

1341
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,464
<i>Sorry, John. Nothing personal.</i>

1342
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:06,587

[crowd screaming]

1344
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:11,258
Oh. Missed the head.

1345
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:14,261
So, what, the company wanted rid of me?
Why not just finish me off

1346
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:16,231
the moment I walked
through those fucking doors?

1347
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,351
Why all this bullshit?

1348
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:19,976
Because not everything is about you, John.

1349
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,271
[Ben] You said Dragunov.

1350
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:26,112
That's a Russian gun.

1351
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,946
Well-spotted, Ben.

1352
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:33,656
Well, as our wonderful senator
said earlier, what was it?

1353
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:35,912
"Everything is for sale

1354
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:38,164
if the price is high enough, eh?"

1355
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:42,373
So, yes, the company
is under new management

1356
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:47,299
and they just wanted to see
which of our members have what it takes

1357
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,216
to join the new administration.

1358
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,711
A stress test, if you will.

1359
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:54,015
[Senator Kyle] What?

1360
01:20:54,641 --> 01:21:00,182
Let me introduce Alissa Romanoff
and her sister, Morgana Romanoff.

1361
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,142
Wait, what?

1362
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,565
Joanna?

1363
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,131
[Jo] Oh, yeah, the Russians pay more.

1364
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,437
[Senator Kyle] Russian?

1365
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,113
[Alice] Well, by name.

1366
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,201
Sisters?

1367
01:21:15,204 --> 01:21:16,204
Sisters.

1368
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,079
Motherfuck.

1369
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:24,252
See, the problem is, Senator,
they started too late with you.

1370
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:28,252
A corruptible CIA agent infiltrates
the highest level of the political system

1371
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,459
to become a corruptible senator

1372
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:34,045
and a corruptible president
surrounded by corruptible yes-men.

1373
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:37,591
<i>But if you start young,</i>

1374
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:40,677
<i>well, then you're a truer person,
incorruptible.</i>

1375
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:45,022
<i>You see,
the Russian government took us in,</i>

1376
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:47,317
gave us both a purpose.

1377
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:52,565
So, Senator, please meet
your future replacement.

1378
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,282
This is a joke, right?

1379
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,619
Does she look like she's joking?

1380
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:08,462
It's been a pleasure.

1381
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:10,882
Sorry, Calvin.

1382
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:11,968
[groans]

1383
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:17,385
Markus, Krystal, you passed. Come with us.

01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:19,308
Sorry, lads.

1385
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:22,018
See you after, Calvin.

01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,079
not that cute.

1391
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,873
But I'm gonna give you a chance.

1392
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:47,623
Stay here one hour and then you can leave.

1393
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:48,874
What, and that's it?

1394
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:51,716
Yeah.

1395
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:53,342

Well, it's a trap.

Right.

1408

One hour, then I can leave.

[Leandro] She's lied to you all day.
Why should you trust her now?

Ah, Leo, I'd really hoped you'd listen.

1411

All you had to do was wait one hour.

01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:53,729
Need a hand there, mate?

1429
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,936

1430
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,271
[chuckles]

1431
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,778
My boy Calvin in there.

1432
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:08,740
Killers Anonymous, you fucking cock.

1433
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,828
Go on, Benny boy.

1434
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,746
- [Alice] Where do you think you're going?
- The heart.

1435
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,679
Seems as though you've forgotten
how this works.

1436
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,591
[laughs]

1437
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,389
Welcome to the fucking club.

1438
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:30,432
It's just, Jo, I mean...

1439
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,622
What's the whole point of this
if we don't set standards?

1440
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,606
There's rules
and those rules have to be followed.

1441
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,765
Jo, you missed your shot.

1442
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,183
No. No.

1443
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:40,893
No! [screaming]

1444
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:46,445
- Go on. Do it.
- Step back.

1445
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,346
[Krystal] Feels different up close,
doesn't it, Benjamin?

1446
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,861
- [Ben] Give her the knife.
- Please.

1447
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,912
I should fucking shoot you, Krys.

1448
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:55,207
- Give her the knife.
- Give me the knife.

1449
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,290
[Ben] I could do this. I could do this!

1450
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,496
- [thud]
- [groans]

1451
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:04,343
God bless.

1452
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:09,756
There you are.

1453
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:33,662
[groaning]

1454
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,756
- It's done.
- [man] <i>There, you see?</i>

1455
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,583
<i>I told you you could do it.</i>

1456
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:46,963
Yeah.

1457
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:48,134
Easier than I thought.

1458
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,636
Well done, Alice.

1459
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:00,186
[newscaster] <i>The story surrounding
yesterday's assassination</i>

1460

Hello?

Hello?

Lovely night for it.

1479
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:08,795
Yeah. I suppose it is.

1480
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:10,877
You lost your way?

1481
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,546
Something like that.

1482
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,472
It's one flight down.

1483
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,351
Oh.

1484
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:19,810
I see. Thanks.

01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:22,354

- Hey.
- Hi.

01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:51,212
I'm not sure if I'm in the right place.

1490
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:54,967
I was told to say "Gemini."

1491
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:59,221
Definitely in the right place,
and the first to arrive.

1492
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,849
Welcome to Killers Anonymous.

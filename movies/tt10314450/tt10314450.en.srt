3
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,913
He was wearing
like this really

4
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,585
stupid orange camouflage shirt.

5
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,419
That's good, Becky.

6
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,087
And do you remember
what happened

7
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,594
to the man in the
orange camouflage shirt?

8
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,170
What happened by
your fort, Becky?

9
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,307
Help.

10
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,448
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,283
I don't know.

12
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:11,691
Boys, stop
that before someone gets hurt.

13
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,592
Come on, get to class.

14
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,198
Let's go, let's go.

15
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,934
Let's go.

16
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,069
Move.

17
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:55,901
Please send Becky Hooper

18
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,136
to the front office.

19
00:03:57,138 --> 00:03:59,138
Her father's here
to pick her up.

20
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,415
On your feet.

21
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,331
Hi, Chipmunk.

22
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,985
Good back there?

23
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:20,986
Yup.

24
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,672
Excuse me.

25
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,073
What's going on?

26
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:41,841
There's something
wrong with this gentleman.

27
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:42,675
Shit.

28
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:43,509
What?

29
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,342
Pull over.

30
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,686
Wanna guess
why I sprung you early?

31
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,020
What?

32
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,889
Can you take your?

33
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,557
Can you turn your
music off please?

34
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:06,065
Got about a quarter tank.

35
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:08,033
I'm gonna pull over.

36
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,605
Oh hey, they have meat sticks.

37
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:13,572
I wonder if they have bison.

38
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:14,407
Gummies.

39
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,542
You hate gummy worms.

40
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,954
Search
continues for four inmates

41
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,056
who escaped federal
custody this morning,

42
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,893
killing two armed guards
and an inmate as they fled.

43
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:37,563
Authorities say the men are
armed and extremely dangerous.

44
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:38,396
In other news.

45
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:52,978
Looks like the
Atlanta Braves are off

46
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,813
to a great start this season.

47
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,414
I'm gonna turn it over to Matt.

48
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,991
A small one.

49
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:06,992
What flavor?

50
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,785
Can you picture?

51
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,153
Those are the shoes I have.

52
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:34,987
Still looks good?

53
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:35,988
Yes.

54
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,789
- Okay.
- Of course, of course.

55
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,690
Yes, okay.

56
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:38,524
Here we go.

57
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,358
Ready?

58
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,192
Mm hm.

59
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:41,026
Oh.

60
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,797
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

61
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,134
Mom is in
serious painter mode.

62
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,036
What do you think?

63
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,673
Why is Dora's
head way bigger than Dad's?

64
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,642
She's just so full
of herself, right.

65
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:59,311
She is pretty awesome.

66
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,980
Okay, got a surprise for you.

67
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,314
Gotta close your eyes.

68
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,054
There.

69
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,324
Okay, open 'em.

70
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:12,860
Oh, Becky.

71
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,563
Much love, girlie.

72
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,386
This whole thing.

73
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,856
I know it's been hard,

74
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,926
but you can't stay
angry forever.

75
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,708
Why would you bring me here?

76
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,742
Calm down, Chipmunk.

77
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,778
Don't call me that.

78
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,546
I thought you said
it would take time.

79
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,416
Like with the
realtors or whatever.

80
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:12,551
Yeah, so about that now.

81
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,954
Can you turn that off, please?

82
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,058
Now.

83
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:21,560
Off.

84
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:24,797
Becky.

85
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,434
Rebecca Hooper, if the
next button you press

86
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,969
is not the off button, you're
grounded for two weeks.

87
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:47,286
You can't keep taking
things that aren't yours.

88
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:49,588
Obviously I can.

89
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,804
She wouldn't
want us to sell it.

90
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,005
Becky...

91
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:40,839
No, just because
she's not here anymore...

92
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,476
We're not selling it.

93
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,145
Been trying to tell you.

94
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:46,979
I changed my mind.

95
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,315
We're keeping it.

96
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,055
Oh, you forgot you hated
me for a minute, huh?

97
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,823
Diego,
we're keeping it.

98
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:58,724
We're keeping it.

99
00:10:58,726 --> 00:10:59,691
Come on.

100
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:00,392
Come on, boy, let's go swimming.

101
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,493
No.

102
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,694
No, I wanna swim.

103
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,196
Yeah, but how
'bout after dinner?

104
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:05,998
There's something else I
need to talk to you about.

105
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,506
What is she doing here?

106
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,840
Well that's part of it.

107
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:18,710
I invited Kayla and
Ty up for the weekend.

108
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:19,713
You made it.

109
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,381
Thank you GPS.

110
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:23,849
I'll park it next to mine.

111
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,350
Do I have to tip the valet?

112
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,185
Yes.

113
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,686
Yes, you do.

114
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,687
Oh, I missed you.

115
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,689
Same here.

116
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,759
Hey, Becky.

117
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,861
It's so generous of
you to share your dad

118
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,866
and this place with
us this weekend.

119
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,604
The drive here was gorgeous.

120
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:46,038
You didn't tell her that
we were coming, did you?

121
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,206
I tried.

122
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,040
Hey, little man.

123
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,374
- How you doing?
- Hi.

124
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,709
I know someone who's
excited to meet you.

125
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,110
Come here.

126
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:52,911
Oh.

127
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:53,745
Oh, hi.

128
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,113
Oh, hi.

129
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,748
Oh, she's really nice.

130
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,217
- She's sweet.
- It's okay.

131
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,886
All right, girl,
give the man some room.

132
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,588
What's her name?

133
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,555
Dora.

134
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:04,056
Diego's down by the lake,

135
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,891
but he takes a bit longer
getting used to new people,

136
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,560
but he knows a lot of tricks.

137
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,228
Pretty much anything Becky asks.

138
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,930
Maybe she'll show
you if you ask.

139
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:12,764
Yeah.

140
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:13,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

141
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:14,433
Yeah, oh see look.

142
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:15,267
See, she likes you.

143
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,071
She likes everyone.

144
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,905
Why don't you go get Diego?

145
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,907
'Cause we're about to eat.

146
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,408
Fine.

147
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,077
Will you take Ty with you?

148
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:25,911
What?

149
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:26,747
No.

150
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,582
You let her walk all over you.

151
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:30,451
She's 13.

152
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,586
Don't worry about Becky.

153
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:36,255
She's like Diego,
takes a bit longer

154
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:38,156
getting used to new people.

155
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,092
Do you wanna help me
build the fire pit?

156
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:42,294
We can have s'mores
after dinner.

157
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,764
What's s'mores?

158
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,164
What's s'mores?

159
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,600
I know.

160
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:49,134
Oh, you are in for a treat.

161
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,002
Come on.

162
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:07,620
Good afternoon.

163
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:09,855
What's going on?

164
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:11,023
Could you step
out of the vehicle?

165
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,369
We appreciate your compliance.

166
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,971
You live nearby?

167
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,806
Half a mile that way.

168
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,509
Driver's license please.

169
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:31,143
My partner's gonna
inspect your vehicle.

170
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,725
Gunshot will carry half a mile.

171
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,660
Don't wanna alarm your wife.

172
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:48,827
What?

173
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,575
Ty.

174
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:12,144
Stop feeding the dog your food.

175
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:13,078
But she's hungry.

176
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,914
No.

177
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,290
Becky, we've got
something that we would like

178
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,094
to talk to you about.

179
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,432
Can you look at me, Chipmunk?

180
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,501
I told you not
to call me that.

181
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:38,937
Yes Rebecca, I would
like to tell you something

182
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,843
and I would like
you to look at me.

183
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:44,612
Okay so.

184
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,784
I know things have been
tough this past year.

185
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:54,154
On all of us, but
especially on you.

186
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,526
Still, we have to look forward.

187
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,465
Part of the healing
process is moving on.

188
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:09,804
Now, Kayla and I, we love
each other very much.

189
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:16,143
So we've decided to get married.

190
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:20,515
What?

191
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:24,349
I know it's a big deal

192
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,385
and it's gonna take
some getting used to,

193
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,155
but it's what we want and...

194
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,524
Is this a joke?

195
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:32,359
It's.

196
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,193
I think a more
stable environment

197
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,665
will be a good thing for you.

198
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,405
She
would've hated you.

199
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,240
Becky.

200
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:55,515
Sorry.

201
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:56,682
That's okay.

202
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:59,217
We both knew that this
wasn't going to be easy.

203
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,051
I'm gonna go check on her.

204
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,355
No, I got it.

205
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:20,207
How could you?

206
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:27,914
I loved your mom so much.

207
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,549
Yeah.

208
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,751
Yeah, I can really tell.

209
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:32,585
Becky.

210
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:33,886
Diego.

211
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:37,055
Will you please come
back and talk, please?

212
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:37,892
Becky.

213
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,326
Ty, stop that.

214
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:16,127
That's for you to eat.

215
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,763
Where did they go?

216
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,097
They're outside talking.

217
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:19,932
They'll be right back.

218
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:20,766
It's okay.

219
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:26,606
Eat your dinner.

220
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,783
Diego, we're staying.

221
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:38,951
We're staying.

222
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:39,785
Come on.

223
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:40,620
Come on.

224
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:53,298
Hello, may I help you?

225
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:33,039
Just play a little
bit of my favorite song.

226
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:33,873
Okay.

227
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:45,751
♪ I will stay by your side ♪

228
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:49,555
♪ I will stay by your side ♪

229
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:53,425
♪ And I want you to find me ♪

230
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:58,432

231
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,535

232
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:03,869
♪ I will ♪

233
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,704
It's okay.

234
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:38,070
Where's your mom, Ty?

235
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:38,806
Kayla?

236
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,076
Jeff, this
gentleman lost his dog.

237
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:46,912
Yeah, I'm afraid he's
a bit of a Houdini.

238
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,246
I'm sorry to
interrupt your dinner.

239
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,314
It's nice to meet you, Jeff.

240
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:51,083
Hi.

241
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:52,283
Can I
get you some water?

242
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,119
Oh, that'd be great.

243
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,086
Thank you.

244
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,647
Here you go.

245
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:56,984
What kind
of dog did you say?

246
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,154
I didn't.

247
00:22:01,556 --> 00:22:05,323
Well it might help to
know what we're looking for.

248
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,230
Okay, well if there's
nothing else...

249
00:22:11,232 --> 00:22:13,065
Cane Corso.

250
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:15,234
Your dog's a Corso?

251
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:16,836
No, your dog's a Corso.

252
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:18,003
Yes.

253
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,672
Doesn't look pure, though.

254
00:22:19,674 --> 00:22:20,506
Well, we're not sure.

255
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:21,740
She's a rescue.

256
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:22,675
Why don't you give
us your number?

257
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:24,176
My dog is a rottweiler.

258
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,678
Pure bred.

259
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,347
Or as the Germans call them.

260
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,518
Butcher's dog.

261
00:22:32,253 --> 00:22:33,552
Endurance.

262
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:34,854
Intelligence.

263
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:35,754
Strength.

264
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:36,555
Traits they were bred for.

265
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:37,857
It's in their blood.

266
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:42,728
That's why you never let
them mate with other breeds.

267
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,029
You get the worst of both.

268
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,198
Okay, I think it's
time for you to go.

269
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,066
I'm gonna go check on Ty.

270
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:48,701
You're leaving right now.

271
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:52,771
Clear out front.

272
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:53,606
Dining room.

273
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,276
She's probably
going for a phone.

274
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:06,051
Stay calm.

275
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,887
Why don't you take
a seat on the couch?

276
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:19,899
No.

277
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,238
Don't.

278
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,573
Please, don't.

279
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:28,408
Please.

280
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:31,577
Please.

281
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:34,649
Take him and walk
out the side door now.

282
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,782
Go.

283
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,769
You see anything?

284
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:58,137
Nothing yet.

285
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,104
Yeah, there's snakes.

286
00:23:59,106 --> 00:23:59,939
There's snakes.

287
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:00,773
There's spiders.

288
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:01,607
There's fucking bats.

289
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:02,341
There's everything.

290
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:03,275
Fuck.

291
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,646
The mosquitoes are killing me.

292
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:08,448
I don't know.

293
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,953
Come on, Ty.

294
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:14,820
Keep up.

295
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:16,288
But we gotta wait for Dora.

296
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,124
What?

297
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:21,860
She'll be fine.

298
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:22,795
We are going to go
find Miss Becky.

299
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:25,631
I need you to move faster.

300
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:27,199
Hey, there.

301
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:29,168
Where you headed?

302
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,536
Nowhere.

303
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:31,804
We're going to get Becky.

304
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:32,640
Becky?

305
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:34,673
Who's Becky?

306
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:47,989
Our dog.

307
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,155
You got a dog?

308
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:53,158
I hate dogs.

309
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,393
Ooh, there she is right there.

310
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:55,561
Big one.

311
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:56,895
Shit.

312
00:24:57,732 --> 00:24:58,564
No, don't, don't.

313
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,532
What was that?

314
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:01,502
Gunshots.

315
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:08,841
Sh.

316
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:09,675
Quiet, boy.

317
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:11,510
Quiet, quiet.

318
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,682
Fuck that.

319
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:22,588
Think you got
it, Sharp Shooter?

320
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,193
Where are they?

321
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,762
I took care of the phone.

322
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:32,364
That wasn't my question.

323
00:25:36,704 --> 00:25:37,736
It's okay.

324
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:38,572
It's okay.

325
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:41,874
Okay, yeah, yeah.

326
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:42,708
Okay.

327
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,542
Stay.

328
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:44,877
Stay.

329
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:55,621
I think we may
have a problem here.

330
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:56,455
You?

331
00:25:57,892 --> 00:25:59,224
Couch.

332
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:00,061
Sit.

333
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,234
I'll make sure the rest
of the house is clear.

334
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,236
Pistol Pete up
there shot Becky.

335
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:13,972
That dog wasn't
gonna hurt you.

336
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:17,576
Becky was a sweet old thing.

337
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:55,447
We're clear.

338
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,615
Excellent.

339
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:59,151
Well, I'm gonna get
what we came for

340
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:01,286
and then we'll be on our way.

341
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:17,204
Just do what they
say and we'll be okay.

342
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:23,041
Jeff, we've seen their faces.

343
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:25,644
I don't think they're
gonna let us live.

344
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,146
We have to do something.

345
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:38,383
Shit.

346
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,494
There once was a little
girl who had a little curl

347
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:23,996
right in the middle
of her forehead.

348
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:27,332
There once was a little
girl who had a little curl

349
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:30,269
right in the middle
of her forehead.

350
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:14,146
What kind of backpack
would you say that is?

351
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:15,482
A sparkly one.

352
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:18,984
Does it look
like a dog's backpack?

353
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,520
Dogs don't
wear backpacks.

354
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:22,154
You're right.

355
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,658
Becky's not a dog.

356
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,728
Becky is a little girl.

357
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,335
I'm looking for a key.

358
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:38,003
It's about this big.

359
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:40,839
It has this symbol
engraved on it.

360
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:42,176
Have you seen it?

361
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,013
No.

362
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:51,852
No.

363
00:30:58,258 --> 00:30:59,561
How 'bout you?

364
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:01,694
Have you seen it?

365
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:04,031
He's never been here before.

366
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,905
Well that leaves little Becky.

367
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:16,043
I need to speak to her.

368
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:20,546
She's not here.

369
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:23,050
She's in Atlanta with her mom.

370
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:25,951
Oh.

371
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:28,053
Yet her backpack and
her phone are here.

372
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,055
See Jeff, I wanna believe you.

373
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:33,628
I really do, but you're
not making it easy.

374
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:39,801
Lucky for us, I
brought a lie detector.

375
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:46,071
So I'm gonna ask again.

376
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,241
Where's Becky?

377
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:53,280
Atlanta.

378
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:07,426
Wait, wait, wait.

379
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:09,096
Ah.

380
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:12,799
Look at that.

381
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:13,633
Clean through.

382
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:14,466
Missed the bone.

383
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,303
She's gonna be fine.

384
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:19,271
Now the little boy.

385
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,673
No, no, please not my son.

386
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:21,940
Please don't.

387
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:23,108
It may just
blow his leg clean off.

388
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,109
- Please don't.
- Answer his question.

389
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:24,943
Please don't.

390
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:25,977
Please, please, please.

391
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:27,279
Hey, assholes.

392
00:32:28,817 --> 00:32:30,115
Oh my God.

393
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:32,117
I called the cops.

394
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,822
They're on their way.

395
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:38,192
Hello, Becky.

396
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:41,661
Better start running.

397
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:42,961
That fat one.

398
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:47,132
He's gonna like need a
head start or something.

399
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:49,635
You didn't call
anyone, sweetheart.

400
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:51,506
I have your cell phone.

401
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:58,678
So?

402
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,645
So I walked to our neighbors.

403
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:00,479
The Griffins.

404
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:02,481
I used their phone.

405
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:04,218
They have a gun, too.

406
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:07,822
So you better leave.

407
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:16,831
Closest neighbor
is a mile and a half.

408
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:18,997
This is a child's toy.

409
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,700
No way it reaches that far.

410
00:33:20,702 --> 00:33:23,870
Gentlemen, Becky is
on this property.

411
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:25,170
And I don't think any of us

412
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,371
feels like playing a
game of hide and seek,

413
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:28,373
so why don't we make
it easy on ourselves

414
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,710
and invite her to us, okay?

415
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:32,010
Stop her bleeding.

416
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:33,211
We might need her.

417
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:35,180
Why don't you walk
Jeffery outside?

418
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,181
No, no, don't
take him, please.

419
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:37,182
Please don't take him.

420
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:39,184
Please don't do this to us.

421
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:40,218
Please don't.

422
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,525
Prepare yourself, Becky.

423
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:48,026
You're about to find out what
happens when you lie to me.

424
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:48,590
You know.

425
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:54,996
I wasn't blessed with children
in the traditional sense,

426
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,635
but I collected some
strays along the way.

427
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:08,108
My eldest.

428
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:14,446
You know my most beautiful
memory of him was?

429
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:17,115
Wasn't the day I found him.

430
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:20,521
It was the day he
proved his love for me.

431
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,626
And tonight, right now actually,

432
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:30,531
will become your most
beautiful memory of Becky

433
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:36,334
'cause this is the moment
she proves her love for you.

434
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,519
Becky, I'm gonna speak
to you like an adult,

435
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:55,821
because I expect
you to act like one.

436
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:57,823
You're not at the neighbors.

437
00:35:57,825 --> 00:36:00,492
I know you're in the
woods behind the house.

438
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:03,696
So do me a favor and direct
your gaze to the fire pit.

439
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:15,041
My companion here, the
unreasonably large, scary one.

440
00:36:15,043 --> 00:36:18,176
He's gonna hold your dad
still while I hurt him.

441
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:21,013
I can promise you it
will not be pleasant.

442
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:32,091
Now we can avoid that
unpleasantness if you cooperate.

443
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:33,360
Listen closely.

444
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:39,197
In the basement, in the
wall, was a small tin.

445
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,766
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

446
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:45,203
No.

447
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:49,709
See, I
don't believe you.

448
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:51,911
You already lied to me once.

449
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:53,713
Now I think you found that tin

450
00:36:53,715 --> 00:36:56,882
and you took what was inside it.

451
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:59,250
I don't
have your stupid key.

452
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:01,252
I never
said it was a key, Becky.

453
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:07,059
Now that I know you have it,
I hope you enjoy the show.

454
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:13,935
Ah.

455
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,403
Ah, ah.

456
00:37:18,573 --> 00:37:19,406
Ah.

457
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:23,077
It's okay.

458
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:24,977
It's okay, baby.

459
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,651
You get one shot.

460
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:33,986
Make it count.

461
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:41,261
Becky.

462
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,497
Listen to me, Chipmunk.

463
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:46,333
Sorry.

464
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,436
I made a mistake.

465
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:51,773
So many mistakes.

466
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:54,675
Look.

467
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:58,112
I know that you're mad at me

468
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:01,814
and you have every right to be.

469
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:10,024
I need you to put
those feelings aside

470
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:13,324
and do something for me.

471
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:23,468
I need you to run away
as fast as you can.

472
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,637
Run, Becky.

473
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,471
Before you run,
Becky, listen up

474
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,841
and know that you can
stop this if you want.

475
00:38:31,813 --> 00:38:32,647
Ah.

476
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:35,650
Ah.

477
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:38,984
No, stop.

478
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:39,819
Stop.

479
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:40,653
I'll get your key.

480
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:42,154
I'll get your key.

481
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:42,990
Ah.

482
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:45,490
Stop.

483
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:46,357
Stop.

484
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:53,666
Ah.

485
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:14,019
I've got your key.

486
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,386
I'm coming.

487
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:17,890
I'm coming, please.

488
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:18,724
I'm almost there.

489
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:21,760
Hold him.

490
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:26,198
Stop.

491
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,703
Oh, there she is.

492
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:48,254
Let's go get her.

493
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:49,123
No.

494
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,557
We don't
have time for this.

495
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,892
No more kids.

496
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:03,468
Go to the neighbors.

497
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,603
Call the police.

498
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:08,406
But Dad.

499
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,575
Right behind you.

500
00:40:09,577 --> 00:40:10,408
I love you, Becky.

501
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,577
Go now.

502
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:26,825
Where's the key, Becky?

503
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:27,660
Where is it?

504
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:28,928
Right here.

505
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,596
Ah.

506
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:32,266
Fuck.

507
00:40:33,134 --> 00:40:34,166
Fuck.

508
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:35,301
Ugh.

509
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:36,168
Ah.

510
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:31,523
Fuck.

511
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:32,490
Holy shit.

512
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:33,726
What happened to you?

513
00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:34,660
Oh,
that little bitch

514
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:36,330
is in the woods out there.

515
00:41:37,398 --> 00:41:38,731
I can't see out of it.

516
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:39,565
Ugh.

517
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:40,499
It's gone.

518
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:41,333
It's shredded.

519
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:42,167
Fuck.

520
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:43,002
Where's Hammond?

521
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:44,169
The kitchen.

522
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,071
They go nowhere.

523
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:46,874
Yeah.

524
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:52,177
You
enjoying your snack?

525
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,014
Oh shit.

526
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,014
Cut it off, man.

527
00:41:55,016 --> 00:41:55,916
Cut it off.

528
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:01,587
Come on.

529
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:02,388
Easy.

530
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,522
Okay, here we go.

531
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:04,523
- You ready?
- Yeah, just do it.

532
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:05,359
Ah.

533
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:07,528
Ah.

534
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:09,697
Ah.

535
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:11,764
Ah.

536
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:14,199
What the fuck is the problem?

537
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:16,103
You fucking kidding me.

538
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,370
Sorry.

539
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:21,709
Ah.

540
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:26,045
Now get the fuck
outside and grab her

541
00:42:26,047 --> 00:42:30,217
before I decide you're too
useless to keep around.

542
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:11,323
Becky, where are you at?

543
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:18,130
Let's just make this
easy on both of us, okay?

544
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:24,670
Hey.

545
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:28,807
Hey Becky.

546
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:32,611
Stop running.

547
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,473
Oh, man, you're in a fort now.

548
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:03,142
What am I gonna do?

549
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:09,014
I guess you should've
locked the door.

550
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:11,518
Fuck, fuck.

551
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,484
Shit.

552
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:13,685
Ugly son of a bitch.

553
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:16,221
Fuck me.

554
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:17,489
Two fucking dogs.

555
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:18,490
How many fucking
dogs you gotta have?

556
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:19,324
Diego, quiet.

557
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:20,159
Motherfucker.

558
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:20,993
Sit.

559
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:21,829
Fuck.

560
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:26,667
Hey.

561
00:44:28,537 --> 00:44:29,370
Cool fort.

562
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:33,874
Hi.

563
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,842
I just wanna talk.

564
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:37,676
No, hey.

565
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:38,710
We're just talking.

566
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:40,347
We're just talking.

567
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:44,584
I don't have a weapon.

568
00:44:44,586 --> 00:44:46,521
I'm not gonna hurt you.

569
00:44:48,923 --> 00:44:50,189
Hello?

570
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:51,025
Go away.

571
00:44:54,395 --> 00:44:55,396
Look, kid.

572
00:44:57,231 --> 00:44:58,565
You really think I
wanna be out here,

573
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:01,202
tripping over shit in the woods?

574
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:05,704
You want me to go.

575
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:06,774
I want to go.

576
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:09,241
But neither of us is gonna get

577
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:12,079
what we want until
I get that key.

578
00:45:15,216 --> 00:45:18,385
So let's you and I
make a little deal.

579
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,056
Just throw the key out here.

580
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:26,391
I'll tell 'em that I picked
it up off the ground.

581
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,594
I'll say you got away.

582
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:29,562
They're not gonna ask
too many questions

583
00:45:29,564 --> 00:45:31,732
so long as I have the key.

584
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:38,573
Okay?

585
00:45:50,084 --> 00:45:50,918
Okay.

586
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:53,087
Okay.

587
00:45:54,656 --> 00:45:59,260
You can just toss it on out
here and I'll be on my way.

588
00:46:01,996 --> 00:46:05,933
You, your little bro and
your mom will be safe.

589
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:11,105
What?

590
00:46:12,507 --> 00:46:13,939
I said you and your
mom and your little brother.

591
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:15,774
You'll all be safe.

592
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:17,778
My mom's dead.

593
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:25,618
Okay well, your stepmom then.

594
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,453
Whatever.

595
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,791
The point is, she's still alive

596
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:35,460
and the little boy
is still alive.

597
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:40,799
And you can go off and
have a nice life together.

598
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:41,800
Right?

599
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:25,911
Becky?

600
00:47:25,913 --> 00:47:27,580
We still got a deal or what?

601
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,723
Hello?

602
00:47:36,725 --> 00:47:38,023
I'm getting your stupid key.

603
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:39,592
Give me a second.

604
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:15,394
Here it comes.

605
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:22,067
Good throw.

606
00:48:27,575 --> 00:48:28,741
Fucking kids.

607
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,115
Ah.

608
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,118
Ah.

609
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,086
Ah.

610
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,154
Fuck.

611
00:48:42,156 --> 00:48:43,088
Ah.

612
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:47,426
What the fuck?

613
00:49:17,357 --> 00:49:18,290
Fuck.

614
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:54,995
I think my leg is still
bleeding pretty bad.

615
00:50:09,511 --> 00:50:10,344
It's okay.

616
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:26,759
It's fine.

617
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:28,530
I'll wrap it tighter.

618
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,537
I heard Jeff screaming.

619
00:50:36,538 --> 00:50:37,371
Is he?

620
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,754
You tried to help us before.

621
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:58,558
You and I both know how
this is gonna end for me.

622
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,459
For my son.

623
00:51:00,728 --> 00:51:02,262
You don't want that.

624
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,464
You don't want this.

625
00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:07,301
You don't.

626
00:51:09,938 --> 00:51:10,772
Please.

627
00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:18,078
Apex.

628
00:51:22,316 --> 00:51:23,150
Please.

629
00:51:47,307 --> 00:51:50,275
I'm not gonna let
them get away with this.

630
00:52:35,857 --> 00:52:36,691
Take it.

631
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:41,495
Take the gun, Apex.

632
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:48,166
Here you go.

633
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:50,337
Now, point it at my heart.

634
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:55,708
Nine years, four
months, and two days.

635
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,512
You know what that is?

636
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:00,680
How long we were in.

637
00:53:00,682 --> 00:53:02,347
That's right.

638
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:07,354
That's 54,538 waking hours.

639
00:53:09,757 --> 00:53:11,557
Do you know how many of those

640
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:14,896
I spent planning,
calculating, this day?

641
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:16,929
Hm?

642
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:19,065
Do you have any idea how many?

643
00:53:19,067 --> 00:53:20,365
Every.

644
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:21,534
Single.

645
00:53:21,536 --> 00:53:22,369
One.

646
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:27,540
Not a moment went
by that this plan,

647
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:29,041
and our glorious
execution of it,

648
00:53:29,043 --> 00:53:32,545
wasn't at the
forefront of my mind.

649
00:53:32,547 --> 00:53:35,581
Now, when you plan
something, anything,

650
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:38,886
you run all the
scenarios in your head.

651
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:44,890
You identify
vulnerabilities, weak points.

652
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:47,927
You try to find out what
that thing is going to be.

653
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:51,599
The one thing that's
gonna be your downfall.

654
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:55,467
All the times I ran it,

655
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:58,573
never once did I
think it would be you.

656
00:54:05,646 --> 00:54:06,748
Those kids.

657
00:54:07,782 --> 00:54:09,949
I can't get them out of my mind.

658
00:54:09,951 --> 00:54:12,585
Put your finger
on the trigger.

659
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:13,418
I don't understand.

660
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,254
Put.

661
00:54:15,255 --> 00:54:16,922
Your finger.

662
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:18,090
On the trigger.

663
00:54:20,762 --> 00:54:23,294
I can't do this
without you, son.

664
00:54:23,296 --> 00:54:25,664
I need you on this.

665
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:30,301
54,538 hours planning.

666
00:54:30,303 --> 00:54:32,772
I don't wanna be
alive for one more

667
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:36,443
knowing that we came
this far and we failed.

668
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:40,846
So, if you're not gonna help me,

669
00:54:43,017 --> 00:54:45,651
you go ahead and kill me.

670
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,137
I knew I could
count on you, son.

671
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:13,712
For the Brotherhood.

672
00:55:17,552 --> 00:55:19,018
For the Brotherhood.

673
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:05,731
Cole.

674
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:16,542
There once was a little
girl who had a little curl

675
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:19,547
right in the middle
of her forehead.

676
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:25,584
When she was good, she
was very, very good,

677
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:29,054
but when she was
bad, she was horrid.

678
00:57:04,759 --> 00:57:08,095
I need you to tell
Becky to come back.

679
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:23,842
You feel better now?

680
00:57:23,844 --> 00:57:26,477
I'm not gonna ask again.

681
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:28,282
Speak slow and clear.

682
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:32,117
She won't listen to me.

683
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,451
You're her guardian.

684
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:34,622
No, I'm not.

685
00:57:35,957 --> 00:57:38,489
And it wouldn't
matter even if I was.

686
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:42,795
Becky is as strong-willed
and vindictive as they come

687
00:57:42,797 --> 00:57:47,467
and you just tortured and
killed her only living parent.

688
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:52,304
So good luck.

689
00:57:59,213 --> 00:58:00,045
Go get her.

690
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:03,315
Hammond's still out there.

691
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:05,483
Yes, but
apparently Becky's a little more

692
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:07,152
than we bargained for.

693
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:15,621
Cole.

694
00:59:15,623 --> 00:59:17,222
Cole.

695
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:18,059
You okay?

696
00:59:19,727 --> 00:59:20,561
Fuck.

697
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:22,396
Shit.

698
00:59:23,898 --> 00:59:25,731
Hey, shit stain.

699
00:59:25,733 --> 00:59:26,765
You want the key?

700
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,400
You gotta catch me first.

701
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:33,439
Come back here.

702
00:59:38,779 --> 00:59:40,114
Right over here.

703
00:59:41,115 --> 00:59:41,947
Not gonna hurt ya.

704
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:44,783
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

705
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:10,275
Little fucking bitch.

706
01:00:19,186 --> 01:00:20,119
Slow down.

707
01:00:43,144 --> 01:00:46,478
End of the line, little fucker.

708
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,214
Fuck.

709
01:00:48,149 --> 01:00:48,983
Fuck.

710
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,353
Ah.

711
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:55,187
Hey.

712
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:06,499
Fuck.

713
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:24,016
Help.

714
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:25,518
I can't swim.

715
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,385
Help please.

716
01:01:26,387 --> 01:01:27,221
Help me.

717
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:09,228
Help me.

718
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,229
Help me.

719
01:02:10,231 --> 01:02:11,564
Help me.

720
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:22,107
Help.

721
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:22,943
Help.

722
01:02:24,979 --> 01:02:26,745
Stop, stop, stop.

723
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:27,913
Ah.

724
01:03:58,540 --> 01:03:59,371
No.

725
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:00,839
Diego, no.

726
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:01,576
No.

727
01:04:05,513 --> 01:04:06,347
Diego.

728
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:09,016
Please, Diego, Diego.

729
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:12,351
Please.

730
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:13,187
Please.

731
01:04:16,758 --> 01:04:18,190
You should have left
when you had the chance.

732
01:04:18,192 --> 01:04:19,024
No.

733
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:19,858
Let me go.

734
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,596
Let me go, let me go.

735
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:23,696
Stop.

736
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:26,532
Ah.

737
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:13,480
I saw what you did to Cole.

738
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:16,651
Those kind of things,

739
01:05:18,152 --> 01:05:20,586
they leave a stain.

740
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:22,755
I got too many stains of my own.

741
01:05:26,761 --> 01:05:29,161
It's not too late for you.

742
01:05:29,163 --> 01:05:30,763
You're just a kid.

743
01:05:46,815 --> 01:05:47,649
I'm done.

744
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:53,185
I don't care what
Dominick wants anymore.

745
01:05:55,956 --> 01:05:57,324
I am walking away

746
01:05:58,459 --> 01:06:00,528
and I hope you will, too.

747
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:13,675
Diego.

748
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:15,810
Diego.

749
01:06:18,847 --> 01:06:20,345
Diego, Diego.

750
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:27,520
It's okay.

751
01:06:27,522 --> 01:06:28,353
You're okay.

752
01:06:28,355 --> 01:06:30,489
You're okay, boy.

753
01:07:10,865 --> 01:07:11,864
It's okay.

754
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:39,391
Hold.

755
01:07:39,393 --> 01:07:40,225
Hold.

756
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:55,442
Hey, dad.

757
01:07:57,444 --> 01:07:58,945
It's me, Chipmunk.

758
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,416
Tell mom hi for me.

759
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:31,010
Diego, come.

760
01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:09,316
Hey.

761
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:13,151
What the fuck was the
point of all of this?

762
01:09:13,153 --> 01:09:14,321
What's that?

763
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:17,990
I said, what
the fuck was the point?

764
01:09:17,992 --> 01:09:18,891
You cursed.

765
01:09:18,893 --> 01:09:20,158
I know, baby.

766
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,661
Sometimes someone does
something so stupid,

767
01:09:21,663 --> 01:09:26,331
you have to stop them and ask,
what the fuck was the point?

768
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:28,501
You murdered my fiance.

769
01:09:28,503 --> 01:09:29,835
Your men are gone.

770
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,671
You lost your fucking eye.

771
01:09:31,673 --> 01:09:33,039
For what?

772
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:33,875
For a key?

773
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:36,174
What the fuck could it open

774
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:37,677
that would make it
worth all of this?

775
01:09:40,548 --> 01:09:41,847
Oh.

776
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:44,016
It's worth much more than that.

777
01:09:44,018 --> 01:09:46,886
See I don't expect you
to understand this,

778
01:09:46,888 --> 01:09:48,921
but I'm doing it for your
kind as much as mine.

779
01:09:48,923 --> 01:09:50,523
Oh, is that right?

780
01:09:50,525 --> 01:09:51,924
Yeah, it is right.

781
01:09:51,926 --> 01:09:55,360
You see the races all were
created with a divine purpose,

782
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:59,699
but our modern world has blurred
and distorted that purpose.

783
01:09:59,701 --> 01:10:01,100
But that's all about to change.

784
01:10:01,102 --> 01:10:02,768
I have a question.

785
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:06,404
Did it take years of hard work
to get this fucking stupid?

786
01:10:06,406 --> 01:10:08,040
Okay.

787
01:10:08,042 --> 01:10:09,742
See you seem to be
under the delusion...

788
01:10:09,744 --> 01:10:11,376
That you're a fucking bitch.

789
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:12,778
Yeah.

790
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:14,046
Fucking.

791
01:10:21,421 --> 01:10:22,722
Don't, don't.

792
01:10:22,724 --> 01:10:24,222
Let me
tell you something.

793
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:25,256
When I come back, your
son's gonna watch you die.

794
01:10:25,258 --> 01:10:26,391
Get off.

795
01:10:32,934 --> 01:10:33,766
Apex?

796
01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:53,418
Okay, you stay here.

797
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:54,252
Don't move.

798
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:55,087
Don't move.

799
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:48,207
Ah.

800
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:52,711
Ah.

801
01:11:52,713 --> 01:11:53,979
Ah.

802
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:54,980
Ah.

803
01:11:54,982 --> 01:11:55,981
Ah.

804
01:11:58,351 --> 01:11:59,985
Ah.

805
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:01,220
Ah.

806
01:12:01,222 --> 01:12:02,021
Ah.

807
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:02,888
Ah.

808
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:05,191
Ah.

809
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:09,163
Ah.

810
01:12:11,232 --> 01:12:13,666
I know you're in there, Becky.

811
01:12:13,668 --> 01:12:15,234
Are you having fun?

812
01:12:15,236 --> 01:12:16,669
I know I am.

813
01:12:16,671 --> 01:12:19,538
Let's just see how fun
we can make it, huh.

814
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,371
Come on.

815
01:12:21,509 --> 01:12:22,675
Let's have some fun.

816
01:12:24,846 --> 01:12:25,845
Open the door, Becky.

817
01:12:25,847 --> 01:12:28,013
Come on, Becky, do it.

818
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:28,848
Come on.

819
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:53,205
Give me your hands.

820
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:55,207
Give me your hands.

821
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:02,548
Roadside
vehicle assist.

822
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:04,382
This is Kate.

823
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:05,584
A collision was detected

824
01:13:05,586 --> 01:13:07,553
and it appears your
airbags have deployed.

825
01:13:07,555 --> 01:13:09,557
Are there any injuries?

826
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:12,224
Hello?

827
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:13,559
Are you able to respond?

828
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:15,561
I'll notify the
local authorities.

829
01:13:15,563 --> 01:13:16,394
Help is on the way.

830
01:13:44,926 --> 01:13:45,758
Becky.

831
01:14:26,968 --> 01:14:27,802
Becky.

832
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:33,541
You're clearly a special girl.

833
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:37,878
So, I'm gonna make
you a special deal.

834
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:41,479
I'm putting my gun away.

835
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:44,984
Okay.

836
01:14:44,986 --> 01:14:46,885
Your dog is still alive.

837
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:47,722
He's safe.

838
01:14:48,823 --> 01:14:49,824
You're safe.

839
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,059
I just wanna talk.

852
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:09,234
You're an orphan now.

853
01:16:09,236 --> 01:16:11,072
Has that sunk in yet?

854
01:16:12,907 --> 01:16:14,475
You're a smart-ass.

855
01:16:15,443 --> 01:16:16,277
Stubborn.

856
01:16:18,412 --> 01:16:19,578
A murderer.

857
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,747
That's what they'll say.

858
01:16:21,749 --> 01:16:23,751
People looking to adopt.

859
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:27,421
Why would we choose her?

860
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:30,324
Who wants that burden?

861
01:16:31,759 --> 01:16:32,561
No one.

862
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:35,427
You'll just end
up in the system.

863
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:38,764
One terrible foster
home after the next.

864
01:16:38,766 --> 01:16:41,433
That's if you're lucky.

865
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:46,440
No one will bother to look close
enough to see the real you.

866
01:16:47,641 --> 01:16:48,809
No one but me.

867
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:52,613
See I.

868
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:56,317
I see your potential.

869
01:16:57,952 --> 01:17:00,855
The raw clay waiting
to take shape.

870
01:17:03,124 --> 01:17:07,459
We had a rocky start,
but that's all behind us.

871
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:10,329
With the right guidance,
one day you'll be able

872
01:17:10,331 --> 01:17:13,799
to look back on
this and see that

873
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:17,469
it was a great
moment in your life.

874
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:19,206
A real turning point.

875
01:17:21,342 --> 01:17:23,976
If you just let me help.

876
01:17:23,978 --> 01:17:27,047
You can help by
shutting your face.

877
01:17:29,984 --> 01:17:32,050
Where is the key?

878
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:33,318
I hid it.

879
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,653
Show me.

880
01:17:36,991 --> 01:17:40,327
I wanna show you
something else first.

881
01:17:42,696 --> 01:17:44,663
We don't
have time for this.

882
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:46,165
I don't wanna have to hurt you.

883
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:51,005
But I do wanna hurt you.

884
01:17:52,373 --> 01:17:53,207
Real bad.

885
01:17:54,408 --> 01:17:56,008
Ah.

886
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,676
Ah.

887
01:17:57,678 --> 01:17:58,513
Ah.

888
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:00,580
Ah.

889
01:18:00,582 --> 01:18:02,014
Ah.

890
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:03,583
Ah.

891
01:18:13,727 --> 01:18:15,427
Fucking little bitch.

892
01:18:24,738 --> 01:18:25,871
Stop.

893
01:18:25,873 --> 01:18:26,939
No.

894
01:18:55,570 --> 01:19:00,305
There was a little girl
who had a little bullet

895
01:19:00,307 --> 01:19:01,139
right in the middle of her.

896
01:19:06,581 --> 01:19:07,446
Son, take it easy.

897
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:08,814
Take it easy.

898
01:19:08,816 --> 01:19:10,449
Okay?

899
01:19:10,451 --> 01:19:11,620
Look, it's me.

900
01:19:13,588 --> 01:19:14,623
Let her go.

901
01:19:15,489 --> 01:19:17,456
After what she did to me?

902
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:18,292
To us?

903
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:25,130
I don't want you to kill her.

904
01:19:25,132 --> 01:19:26,599
It's almost over now.

905
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:28,267
Look, I've got the key already.

906
01:19:28,269 --> 01:19:29,434
It's right here.

907
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:32,139
Everything we've
ever worked for.

908
01:19:34,174 --> 01:19:36,176
After her, no more kids.

909
01:19:37,978 --> 01:19:39,313
Ever, I promise.

910
01:19:40,781 --> 01:19:43,817
But right now we
need to finish this.

911
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,286
For the Brotherhood.

912
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:56,196
I said, let her go.

913
01:20:09,678 --> 01:20:11,312
Bet you're right.

914
01:20:12,681 --> 01:20:15,147
Who's gonna believe a
little girl anyway, right?

915
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:16,214
Go, Becky.

916
01:20:16,216 --> 01:20:17,149
Now.

917
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:23,690
Ah.

918
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:04,029
Ah.

919
01:21:42,403 --> 01:21:43,937
I'm sorry.

920
01:21:45,272 --> 01:21:48,907
I should never have left
you alone to face him.

921
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:52,277
There's no undoing
the things I've done,

922
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:53,945
but maybe by saving you.

923
01:23:29,009 --> 01:23:29,909
Becky.

924
01:23:33,046 --> 01:23:34,346
Are you okay?

925
01:24:20,562 --> 01:24:25,063
Is there anything
else you can tell us?

926
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:25,967
Any detail.

927
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:30,237
Doesn't matter how small.

928
01:24:34,943 --> 01:24:36,241
Something.

929
01:24:36,243 --> 01:24:39,112
Something about a
Canadian quarter.

930
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,247
He was looking for it.

931
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:43,317
In the grass.

932
01:24:46,486 --> 01:24:48,921
Is that what you want?

933
01:24:48,923 --> 01:24:51,156
Don't worry about
satisfying the Sheriff.

934
01:24:51,158 --> 01:24:54,662
Just answer the questions
as best you can.

935
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:06,471
She remembers the
shirt, but not stabbing him

936
01:25:06,473 --> 01:25:08,808
in the face with
her art pencils?

937
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:10,175
Blind spots.

938
01:25:10,177 --> 01:25:11,777
I'm not surprised.

939
01:25:11,779 --> 01:25:14,279
The violence she's witnessed.

940
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:17,016
It's the violence
she committed that worries me.

941

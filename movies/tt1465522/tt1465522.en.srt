2
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,601
Should we be doing this?
It's still a crime scene.

3
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,900
Sack up, Billy. It's called
"investigative journalism" for a reason.

4
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:22,989
Yeah, but don't we need a press pass
or a permit or something?

5
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:25,118
Press pass this!

6
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:28,499
You know, the police missed
something here, I can feel it.

7
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:32,048
What do you say, Billy? Won't a Peabody
Award look great up on your...

8
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,980
-Yo, Chuck, speed up, man!
-Yeah, man, speed up.

9
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:05,237
Guys, this is my dad's car.
So if I go any faster, he will kill me.

10
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,866
- Holy shit!

11
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:09,161
- Shit!
- Jesus, that was close.

12
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:10,706
You fucking assholes!

13
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:13,794
We are in hillbilly country now, boys.
Squeal like a pig!

14
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:18,262
Chad, just cos they're not in your
fraternity doesn't mean they're freaks.

15
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:22,729
Actually, it does, Allison. You see,
you're either Omega Beta or you're a freak.

16
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:25,067
- Omega Beta! Omega Beta!
- Fuck.

17
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:28,114
I'm in a oar full of morons.

18
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:31,371
No, if we were morons,
we wouldn't have thought to bring this.

19
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:34,585
OK, I stand corrected.
You are a fucking genius.

20
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:37,216
Hey, Chuck, speed up, man.
They're gonna pass us.

21
00:01:37,258 --> 00:01:38,635
Oh, jeez. Whoa, Jesus.

22
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,909
Did you see the way
those guys looked at us?

23
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,372
Hey, guys! Guys!

24
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,711
We forgot the beer!

25
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:58,464
No!

26
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:39,001
Sure you got everything
you need? Cos once you get up there...

27
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:47,894
Can I help you?

28
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,609
Uh, yeah. Where's your beer at?

29
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,490
Beer's in the back.

30
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:02,755
You see the way them kids looked?

31
00:03:06,388 --> 00:03:10,437
- Read that list back to me.
- OK, three-quarter-inch nails,

32
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,735
hacksaw, baling hooks,

33
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,284
brush-clearing Scythe, clamps...

34
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:19,121
Hey, Chad, do we need more bug...

35
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:21,709
- crosscutting handsaw...
- Chad?

36
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:24,047
- Lubricated condoms...
- Chad?

37
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,549
Hand drill...

38
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:34,400
Feminine napkins, stone bit, one-eighth hole saw...

39
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:37,030
- Oh, my God!
- It's just me.

40
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:41,498
Let's get out of here.
This place is so creepy.

41
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:52,102
- Dale, we need anything else?
- Pickled eggs. Six-pounder.

42
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:57,903
Oh, hot dog, Tucker. Have you ever
seen anything like that in your life?

43
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,079
There's nothing so special about them.

44
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:06,462
- They're just your average college girls.
- Nothing average about that.

45
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:08,090
You know something, Dale?

46
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:10,595
She's just human.
Why don't you go over and talk to her?

47
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:14,019
Talk to her? What?
What in the world would I say?

48
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,320
I don't know. Tell her that you got a vacation
home. That'll probably impress her.

49
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:22,035
Are you out of your mind, Tucker?
These are college girls.

50
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:25,499
They grew up with vacation homes,
and guys like me fixing their toilets.

51
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,713
You gotta have some faith in yourself, man.
Girls can smell fear.

52
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:31,677
Now come on!
You are a good-lookin' man...

53
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:33,139
more or less.

54
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:34,516
You got a damn good heart.

55
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,145
Yup.

56
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:39,693
I mean, that's two things right there.
Now, go on, get over there.

57
00:04:39,777 --> 00:04:41,738
What's the worst that could happen?

58
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:45,789
You know something?

59
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,839
- You're right, Tuck. I'm gonna do it.
- All right.

60
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:53,260
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- All right, hold up.

61
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:57,770
All right, now, whatever you say,
just smile and laugh.

62
00:04:57,812 --> 00:04:59,356
It shows confidence.

63
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:02,612
Smile and laugh. OK.

64
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:04,658
- Do it.
- All right.

65
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:23,360
You guys, uh...goin' campin'?

66
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:31,710
Hey! Hey. Now, look...
we don't want any trouble, all right?

67
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:33,547
- So just...back off.
- Whoa!

68
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:35,050
- OK. OK. I'm sorry.
- Back off!

69
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:38,974
Get in the truck.

70
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:44,651
That's a-a good-lookin' cooler...

71
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:57,676
I told you, Tucker. I'm a zero with the ladies.

72
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:00,934
They hate my face!

73
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:02,853
Come on.

74
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:13,750
I ain't like you, Tucker, you know?
I can't talk to the lady folk the way you can.

75
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:16,296
No one can. I mean, I...

76
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:20,470
I always get all stupid, and my hands get
clammy, and I just act like a big fat idiot.

77
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:24,228
You know what your problem is?
You got an inferiority complex.

78
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,815
No, I don't.

79
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:27,526
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

80
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:30,866
Let me tell you something, life is short.
You got to go after what you want.

81
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:32,243
Mm-hm.

82
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:35,667
Cos it sure as hell
ain't gonna just fall right in your lap.

83
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,336
- That's true, I reckon.
- Aw, shit.

84
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,842
- What are you doing?
- Shit, shit. We got a cop.

85
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:41,428
Oh, I got you.

86
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,685
I got a rag. Move your arm.
You spilled beer all over your crotch.

87
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:46,688
All right, he's pulling over.

88
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:48,901
- Get up, Dale.
- I can't.

89
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,614
- Dale, he's coming.
- No, it's stuck on my sleeve.

90
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:52,992
- Get up.
- My hand is stuck on...

91
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:55,623
Un-stuck it, then.
He's out of his car.

92
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:57,459
- He's out of his car?
- He's coming.

93
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,254
- Tucker!
- Get it...

94
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:05,474
Yeah.

95
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,983
- Howdy, Officer.
- Hey.

96
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:13,615
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:14,700
License, please.

98
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:19,585
Uh, I lost my wallet a couple weeks back.
New one is in the mail.

99
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:23,717
Temporary.

100
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,388
Where you two headed?

101
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:28,687
We're headed to our vacation home
up by Morris Lake.

102
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:32,735
I sank every penny I had into it.

103
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:36,284
Me and Dale here, we're gonna go fix 'er up,
maybe do a little fishin'.

104
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:39,248
- Do a little fishin'.
- He's been striking out with the ladies.

105
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,171
I figured a little man time
might do him some good.

106
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:49,100
There ain't nothing up there but pain and
suffering on a scale you can't even imagine.

107
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:55,821
I pulled you over cos
you got a broken turn signal.

108
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:57,533
Oh, yes, sir.

109
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,371
See that you, uh...

110
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,962
get that fixed.

111
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:05,966
That was very helpful.

112
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,735
- Man, that was tense.
- That dude's weird.

113
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:17,029
There he goes.

114
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:19,200
Bye _

115
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:22,957
God, would you look at him?
You know what his problem is?

116
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:25,964
He was jealous because
he can't afford a place of his own.

117
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,260
Well...

118
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:31,766
Here's to the good life, huh?

119
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:36,149
- Oh, yeah.
- To the good life, man.

120
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:55,269
I mean, what's a parasite?
Oh, look at this little truck right here!

121
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:58,109
- I know, I know.
- Is that ours?

122
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:00,113
- Wow. And another one right there.

123
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,400
Oh, my God.

124
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:22,614
It's perfect!

125
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:25,495
- And what did they call this, a fixer-upper?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:29,378
- All right, let's go check it out inside.
- Yeah.

127
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:32,634
I can't believe this is ours! Oh, my God!

128
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:43,905
- 'ell, it's just a little dusty is all.
- It's a mansion!

129
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,934
Whoever used to live here must have been
an archaeologist or something.

130
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:01,731
Yeah, archae... Yeah.

131
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:04,946
Look at this.
Must have been a real news junkie, too.

132
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:17,011
Chubby's Chili Dog Depot?
Buy three, get two free. No expiration date.

133
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:20,309
- All right.
- Score!

134
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:24,317
Tucker, look! They got my favorite
board game here, too.

135
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:28,075
You know what?
I tell you something, Dale.

136
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:31,665
I cannot believe that I am standing
in my own vacation home right now.

137
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:33,918
You know something?

138
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:37,342
Dreams really do come true.

139
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:38,636
Look out!

140
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,061
Well , I guess we should fix that.

141
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:45,357
Yeah, that's a good idea.

142
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:48,906
You can get off me now.

143
00:10:49,574 --> 00:10:52,496
If you have a reoccurring dream about
sucking a dick but never do it, are you gay?

144
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:54,082
- Yes.
- Really?

145
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:55,292
- Guys!
- Are you serious?

146
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:57,799
- What?
- You guys want to hear a scary story?

147
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:00,094
- No!
- Chuck, no.

148
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:01,973
- Absolutely not.
- That's not funny.

149
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:05,062
- You're such a liar.
- It happened to my cousins, I think.

150
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:09,279
Now, do you fuckers
want to hear a real story? Huh?

151
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:17,669
This story happened right here,
right in these very woods.

152
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:22,137
It was 20 years ago today.

153
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:29,902
The Memorial Day Massacre.

154
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:35,370
How a bunch of college kids...
just like us...

155
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:38,125
they came out here to have a good time...

156
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:45,891
but little did they know that they weren't
the only ones in these here woods.

157
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:51,443
J` Pump it up
J` While your feet are stompin’

158
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:53,447
J` And the jam is pumpin’...

159
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:56,829
J` Pump it up a little more

160
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,333
J` Get the party going on the dance Hoof

161
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,838
J` See, cos that’s where the...

162
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,260
Get another one! Come on!

163
00:12:04,343 --> 00:12:07,099
J` I’m gonna meet my maker

164
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:09,770
J` I ain’t afraid to die

165
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:14,155
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, put that back on.

166
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:16,451
No, no.
This is cool, I like this.

167
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,742
Only one person lived to tell this story.

168
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:03,290
The rest of them just disappeared...

169
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:07,507
and their bodies are buried beneath us.

170
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:13,268
Hey! Hey! There's a lake back there.

171
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,397
Who wants to go skinny dipping?

172
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:17,943
- I do.
- Yeah.

173
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:21,325
- All right.
- I'm not getting naked.

174
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,472
That's OK, Tuck.

175
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,309
You take that. That's yours.

176
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:37,982
That's why you're never gonna
get ahead in life.

177
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:40,738
It's cos you don't stick up for yourself.

178
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,581
Do not even think about it.

179
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:48,085
- But you just said...
- Are you kidding me?

180
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:50,298
Are you serious?

181
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:53,304
What'd I just say?

182
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:57,019
- You said I gotta stick up for myself.
- I said, "Don't even think about it", though.

183
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,689
That was the last thing I said.

184
00:14:05,954 --> 00:14:06,997
Hello?

185
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,504
Is someone there?

186
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:12,507
Guys?

187
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:18,686
Yargh!

188
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:21,608
God, Chad! What the hell are you doing?

189
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,655
- You are such an asshole.
- Come on, that was funny.

190
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,159
No, it wasn't.

191
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:28,706
You got nothing to worry about, Allie.
It's just me.

192
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:30,668
You totally freaked me out.

193
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:34,633
You know, you can drop the act now.

194
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:38,683
- What act?
- Like you're better than everyone else.

195
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:42,064
- I don't think...
- Yeah, you do.

196
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:45,279
But that's OK, Allie, because I get it.

197
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:49,078
I mean, you are better than everyone else.

198
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,376
You and I, Allie...

199
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:56,091
are cut from a different cloth.
You know what I mean?

200
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:59,223
- I'm not... I...
- All I'm saying is...

201
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:05,067
I'm glad that we have this chance
to get to know each other better.

202
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:09,911
Chad, you're drunk.

203
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:13,375
That's a good thing. It lowers my inhibitions.

204
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:16,464
OK, uh...

205
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:18,802
- Come on, stop.
- Why?

206
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:20,554
Why? Why stop?

207
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:23,270
We're perfect for each other.

208
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:29,030
Let's talk about this later.
I'm gonna go catch up with everyone.

209
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:31,117
Come on, Allie. Come on...

210
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:36,461
- Oh, it's so cold!
- Here we go!

211
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:40,302
What’s that all about?

212
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:45,145
I don't know,
but I think we should go check it out.

213
00:15:45,186 --> 00:15:47,357
No. No, Tuck, you know what?

214
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,279
My guess would be that they
don't really want to see us right now.

215
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:54,038
- Yeah, I kind of want to see them.
- No, no.

216
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,709
What the hell are you doing?

217
00:15:59,798 --> 00:16:00,883
- Damn it, Dale!
- What?

218
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:03,472
I'm not gonna go around
one more time with you on this.

219
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:05,351
- OK.
- Hush.

220
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:09,859
I love camping!

221
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:13,407
Look.

222
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:18,793
Oh.

223
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:25,347
- Tucker!
- Shush!

224
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,611
God damn it, Dale!
What the hell is the matter with you?

225
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,281
Me? What did I do?

226
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:37,579
When you see a college girl prancing
around in front of you half-naked,

227
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:42,046
- you do not yell out my name.
- Well, you were being a Peeping Tom.

228
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,759
You are hopeless,
do you know that? You're hopeless.

229
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:48,852
She didn't come up yet.

230
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:52,442
- Tuck, paddle.
- Oh, Jesus.

231
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:57,617
Hey! Lady?

232
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:00,458
Hey, lady!

233
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:04,381
- Where'd she go, Tuck?
- Whoa, whoa, Dale!

234
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:11,145
Help me get her in the boat! Come on!

235
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:13,440
Get her legs!

236
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:16,029
Oh! No!

237
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:19,034
- Hey, we got your friend!
- Oh, God!

238
00:17:19,076 --> 00:17:22,666
They got Allison! Come on!

239
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:25,798
Hey!

240
00:17:26,883 --> 00:17:29,721
We got your friend! Why the hell
are they running away? Hey!

241
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:33,604
Doesn't matter, Tucker, we gotta get her
back to the cabin. Come on, let's row.

242
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:36,235
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

243
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:39,699
Shit.

244
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,454
Chad! Chad!

245
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,668
The hillbillies...

246
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:46,922
- What hillbillies?
- From the store!

247
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:48,883
They captured Allison!

248
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:00,072
Allie!

249
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:35,724
Oh, God! No.

250
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:40,024
- No, please! No, please, don't...
- Don't...don't cry.

251
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,443
Please don't cut me open!

252
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,997
Oh! It's the pancakes! You hate pancakes!
I'll go make you something else. I'll just...

253
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,086
Doesn't like pancakes.

254
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:53,467
Should have asked her if she liked
pancakes. Big fat stupid idiot!

255
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:57,015
Pa... Pancakes?

256
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:01,274
Allison!

257
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:03,486
I don't understand.
Where do you think they took her?

258
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:07,201
- Maybe they took her to the hospital.
- You don't get it, do you?

259
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:09,247
Chuck, tell him what you saw.

260
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,713
Well, it was really dark,
but it looked like one of the guys was...

261
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:14,674
Like...eating her face off.

262
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:17,722
That is so disgusting.

263
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:19,893
Not to sound too cliché,
but shouldn't we go to the police?

264
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:21,562
And just leave Allison with them?

265
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:23,567
If they already ate her,
what difference does it make?

266
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,948
We don't need the police.
We can handle this on our own.

267
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:31,080
What if I go? It's my dad's truck. He told me
I was the only one allowed to drive it.

268
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:33,001
Fine. You wanna go, Chuck? Then just go.

269
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,965
OK, awesome. I'll be back in a jiffy, I swear.

270
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,430
That's such bullshit.
Why does he get to go?

271
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:50,577
Hey, guys!
You better come look at this.

272
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,506
What is this place?

273
00:19:56,548 --> 00:20:00,012
It's just a cabin.
It doesn't mean they're psycho killers.

274
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:03,142
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you
go in there and talk to them?

275
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:05,146
All right. Maybe I will.

276
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:09,990
I said maybe.

277
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:36,081
There you go. Please don't tell me
that you hate eggs and bacon.

278
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:40,758
Wha-What am I doing here?

279
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,056
Oh, you don't remember?
OK. Uh...

280
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:46,727
Well, me and Tucker...

281
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:49,065
I mean, uh, I and Tuck...

282
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,818
Well...

283
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:56,663
- Tucker and I brung you here last night.
- Why?

284
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:59,585
Because you were about
to go swimming with your friends,

285
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:02,549
and you climbed up on a bunch of rocks,
and you fell and banged your head

286
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,054
and then you fell into the water,
and then...

287
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:07,558
I dove in and rescued you.

288
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:13,153
- Wait, you...you were spying on us?
- No. No, what? No!

289
00:21:13,195 --> 00:21:15,408
No, we weren't spying.
No, I swear to God, no, no.

290
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:18,162
We were out there fishin'. OK?
I didn't... We didn't see...

291
00:21:18,204 --> 00:21:21,127
I didn't see...
Maybe Tucker might have seen a little...

292
00:21:21,168 --> 00:21:22,671
Where are my friends?

293
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:26,805
- They ran off into the woods.
- They just left me?

294
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:29,142
Yeah, but don't be mad at them.

295
00:21:29,184 --> 00:21:32,356
Some people just aren't any good in a crisis,

296
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:35,280
and that's why Tucker and I brung you here,

297
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:38,118
hoping that they would
come get you in the morning.

298
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:43,127
I didn't have any girlie clothes, so...

299
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,048
It's OK, I...

300
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:47,511
I never really had much fashion sense,
anyway.

301
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:49,932
- Me neither.
- Yeah.

302
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:56,613
That's my dog, Jangers. He looks mean,
but he's just a big old marshmallow.

303
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:58,783
You can just pet him round the nose.

304
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:00,953
- He's drooling.
- I know.

305
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:06,004
Anyway, um...I'm sorry
about all the mess around here.

306
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:09,136
Tucker just bought this place,
and, uh...you know...

307
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:13,728
Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't look like much
to a high-class girl like you,

308
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:18,446
but we've always just had sort of
a dream to have our own vacation home.

309
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:21,159
But, uh...anyway...

310
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:25,084
you should relax and rest, OK?

311
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:27,630
Hey, what's...
what's your name?

312
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:29,342
Uh...

313
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:32,265
It's Tale. Ducker.
My name...

314
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:35,729
- My name is Dale.
- I'm Allison.

315
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,941
But my...
my friends call me Allie.

316
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:41,992
Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you,
Allie...son.

317
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:45,205
And if you need anything else,
you just holler for me.

318
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,209
I'll be right in the little room here.

319
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,552
- Uh, Dale?
- Yeah.

320
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:54,766
Do you guys have
anything to do around here?

321
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,394
Do you like board games?

322
00:22:58,565 --> 00:23:00,443
What kind do you have?

323
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:04,952
We got this one right here.
It's my favorite. Trivi-Up.

324
00:23:07,917 --> 00:23:09,836
- Yes!
- Come on, four out of seven.

325
00:23:09,878 --> 00:23:11,673
No way, dude. You lost.

326
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:15,515
Just shut up and walk, bitch.

327
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:30,794
Goddamn Romeo.

328
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,884
Oh, well.

329
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,502
Oh, Jesus.

330
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:12,583
Run! Run for your lives!

331
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,200
Here we go. Big roll. Five.

332
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:15,830
One, two, three, four, five.

333
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:17,584
OK, shoot.

334
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:21,382
Who was the fifth President
of the United States?

335
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:23,260
Oh, that's too easy. That's James Monroe.

336
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:27,937
God, you are right again. You are killing me.

337
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:30,191
I know. I'm sorry about that. I just...

338
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:33,197
I got this weird brain
where I'm dumb as a stump,

339
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,913
- but I remember everything I ever heard.
- That sounds pretty smart to me.

340
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:41,338
No, trust me, I'm stupid.
I barely even made it past the third grade.

341
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,466
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

342
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:47,267
There's a difference
between education and intellect.

343
00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:52,651
Yeah?

344
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,413
So, um, what is it that you study in college?

345
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:00,667
I'm getting my Bachelor's
degree in psychology.

346
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:03,088
Oh, a Bach... Oh.

347
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:07,680
So, what kind of work
would you do with that?

348
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:09,767
Oh, I don't know. I, um...

349
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:13,190
I-I have these stupid dreams.

350
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:14,819
Dreams are not stupid.

351
00:26:16,572 --> 00:26:22,500
Well, um...I just think that so many of the
major problems and conflicts in the world

352
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,838
are caused by a lack of communication,
you know?

353
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,965
- Yeah.
- And I just...

354
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:29,388
I just always thought that
I'd make a really good therapist.

355
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,934
No, don't! Don't!

356
00:26:30,975 --> 00:26:35,025
Yeah, my parents say the same thing.
I should probably just give up.

357
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:39,366
No. I think you could do whatever you want.
It's just, that beam is a little bit rickety.

358
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:42,248
Yeah, you could have just
pushed that thing right over.

359
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,792
Hey, hey.

360
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:46,421
Oh, my God, Tucker,
what happened to your face?

361
00:26:46,463 --> 00:26:48,759
I sawed into a bees' nest.

362
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:51,138
Why?

363
00:26:51,222 --> 00:26:53,895
I didn't do it on purpose, you idiot.

364
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,942
I might have avoided it
if you were out there helping me!

365
00:26:59,906 --> 00:27:01,158
Yeah.

366
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,874
We came out here to work...

367
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:07,337
not sit around playing stupid board games!

368
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:10,301
It was my fault, I...
I suckered him into playing.

369
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:12,889
No, that's not true. It was my fault.

370
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,606
How about I come over there
and pull those stingers out of your face?

371
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:18,525
Then I'll help you with whatever you want?

372
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,906
- All right, I'd like that. Thank you.
- OK.

373
00:27:21,948 --> 00:27:24,829
Let me help.
Wow, they really did a number on you.

374
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:27,752
- Be careful. Be careful.
- They really got you.

375
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:28,962
Hi.

376
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:30,716
I saw your friend out there.

377
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:37,687
He must be allergic to bees or something,
because he was runnin' like a bat outta hell.

378
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:41,570
- I should go out there and find them...
- No, no! That's... No!

379
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:45,285
No, you need to rest,
so we'll go find your friends.

380
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:48,584
- But I can just...
- No. No buts, OK?

381
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:52,006
We'll go find your friends. You should relax.
Tucker and Dale are on the case.

382
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:53,551
Ain't that right, Tucker?

383
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:56,765
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

384
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,897
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Good man. OK.

385
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:04,239
Dale, just...
just be careful, OK?

386
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,535
My friends can be kind of judgmental.

387
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:09,039
I'm gonna let Tucker
do most of the talking, anyway.

388
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:12,170
He can win over just about anybody,
can't you? Real people person.

389
00:28:14,466 --> 00:28:18,224
OK, here we go.
You just relax, OK? Get some rest.

390
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:29,162
- They fucking killed him, man.
- They left his body here as a message.

391
00:28:29,203 --> 00:28:34,422
- Yeah, "Stay the fuck out of our woods."
- I can't believe this is happening.

392
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:38,847
Would you fucking quit it with this thing?
It doesn't work out here!

393
00:28:39,974 --> 00:28:42,520
We gotta get to the road
and try to catch a ride out of here.

394
00:28:42,562 --> 00:28:46,236
We don't need a ride out of here.
Don't you get it?

395
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:49,618
This is what it's all about.
It's us against them.

396
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:52,581
Survival of the fittest!

397
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:56,882
What are you doing, man?

398
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:58,259
That's my whole face.

399
00:28:58,343 --> 00:29:00,722
You have serious issues, you know that?

400
00:29:00,764 --> 00:29:04,521
- Quick. Somebody's coming.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit...

401
00:29:04,563 --> 00:29:08,154
And the answer was,
"isosceles triangle". You know what that is?

402
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:10,199
- Is it a triangle?
- Yeah.

403
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:12,370
Tucker, you would have been proud of me.

404
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:15,919
A smart little college girl like that,
and I was beating the crap out of her.

405
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:17,673
- Dale.
- Yeah?

406
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,511
You beat the crap outta everybody.
There's something wrong with your brain.

407
00:29:20,553 --> 00:29:22,180
I know. You keep telling me that.

408
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:26,690
Tell you what, when we get back I'll finish
her off real quick then we'll get back to work.

409
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,819
They're gonna kill her!

410
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:34,078
- Somebody was just here.
- Oh, yeah. It's a hatchet.

411
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,001
College kids!

412
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:42,971
- College kids!
- Say it again. Louder.

413
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:46,561
- College kids!
- Hey, college kids!

414
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:49,860
College kids!

415
00:29:49,902 --> 00:29:51,446
I don't see 'em.

416
00:29:52,615 --> 00:29:54,409
They must have run off.

417
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:59,921
Well... Maybe we could leave
them a note in case they come back.

418
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:01,215
All right. With what?

419
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,306
- Well, this'll work.
- All right. Please, hurry up.

420
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:09,981
- My face is as hot as a hemorrhoid.
- Yeah, you don't look so good. OK.

421
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:12,152
- Careful.
- I'm gonna have to etch it in.

422
00:30:36,031 --> 00:30:39,121
J` Uh-huh, I got my cootie shot

423
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:41,417
J` You think that girl is hot...

424
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:43,839
- Dale?
- Yeah? Huh...

425
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,097
- Did you guys find my friends?
- Uh, whoa.

426
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:49,850
Whoa.

427
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:52,271
- What?
- Huh? What?

428
00:30:52,354 --> 00:30:54,943
Your friends? No, no.
Uh, we left them a note.

429
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:57,156
They should be by here any minute.

430
00:30:59,953 --> 00:31:03,167
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm digging a shitter hole.

431
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:05,338
I'm digging a crap... crapper hole.
It's a...

432
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:08,093
It's a hole.
It's for the shithouse. Craphouse...

433
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:10,807
- Outhouse hole.
- An outhouse hole.

434
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:14,189
- Right. You mind if I help?
- What? No!

435
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:17,822
No, no, it's not work for a pretty...
for a girl like you. That's...

436
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:19,574
Oh.

437
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:22,747
I grew up on a farm.
It was either help out or get out.

438
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:24,166
That's a good rule.

439
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:26,754
Yeah. So I've done this before,
believe it or not.

440
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:27,841
Yeah.

441
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,314
You gonna help,
or just stand there staring at me?

442
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:39,905
- Uh... No, I'm gonna help. I'll just...
- I can't dig this on my own.

443
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:41,449
Yeah, yeah.

444
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:45,249
- Yeah, you're doing a good job.
- Thank you.

445
00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:58,316
That sick fuck.
He's making her dig her own grave.

446
00:31:58,357 --> 00:32:00,027
We don't have much time.

447
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,618
- Does everybody have their weapons?
- All set, man.

448
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,666
All right, you guys go around, get the guy
at the wood chipper. You take the big guy.

449
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,846
I'm gonna just chill right here.

450
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:19,941
OK, one more load and we're done.

451
00:32:20,943 --> 00:32:24,367
Hey, come on, get out. Here.

452
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:28,374
Now!

453
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:30,586
Huh?

454
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,552
Oh, good, look, your friends are here. Hey!

455
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:37,140
Dale!

456
00:32:42,484 --> 00:32:45,908
Oh, God!

457
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:25,484
Are you OK?

458
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:31,996
Allison, say something!

459
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:36,380
-Tucker! Tucker!
- Holy mother of God!

460
00:33:36,463 --> 00:33:38,592
You'll never beli... What happened to you?

461
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:42,100
- Are you OK?
- What happened to me?

462
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:47,652
Some kid, he just hucked himself
right into the wood chipper!

463
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,156
- What?
- Headfirst right into the wood chipper!

464
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:53,664
From his shoes and pants, it looked like
it might have been one of the college kids.

465
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:55,417
What the hell happened to her?

466
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:58,548
She got knocked out and fell
in the shitter hole right next to me.

467
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:00,426
Is that your blood?
What? No.

468
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:03,808
No, it's college kid blood. One of them
suckers came running out of nowhere,

469
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,229
speared himself through the gut
and died right on top of me!

470
00:34:06,271 --> 00:34:08,191
- Holy crap.
- I know!

471
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,485
Calm down. Don't cry.

472
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:10,571
- Calm down!
- OK.

473
00:34:10,612 --> 00:34:12,993
Get a hold of yourself!

474
00:34:15,372 --> 00:34:18,795
All right...
I know what this is.

475
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:21,842
- What?
- This is a suicide pact.

476
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:23,930
- It's a what?
- These kids are coming out here,

477
00:34:23,972 --> 00:34:27,812
- and killing themselves all over the woods.
- My God, that makes so much sense.

478
00:34:27,854 --> 00:34:30,485
Holy shit. We have got to hide
all of the sharp objects!

479
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,531
You know what else?
I think they're trying to kill her, too.

480
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,536
Yeah. Think about it.

481
00:34:35,578 --> 00:34:39,502
That's why they acted so funny after
we saved her, because they want her dead.

482
00:34:40,796 --> 00:34:44,135
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

483
00:34:44,177 --> 00:34:47,476
It's good that you and I don't know -
if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.

484
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,396
Yeah, that's a good point.

485
00:34:49,438 --> 00:34:51,984
OK, so what... what do we...

486
00:34:52,026 --> 00:34:54,406
We go to the police?

487
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,201
- Call the police?
- Yeah.

488
00:34:57,286 --> 00:35:00,041
- And tell 'em what?
- Uh...we'll tell 'em what happened.

489
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:02,337
That's a good idea, Dale.

490
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:06,637
"Oh, hidey-ho, Officer.
We've had a doozy of a day.

491
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:10,019
"There we were, minding our own business,
doing some chores around the house,

492
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:12,399
"when kids started killing themselves
all over my property."

493
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:14,193
Well, that's what happened, Tucker!

494
00:35:14,235 --> 00:35:17,408
You would have to be a moron
to believe that, Dale.

495
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,667
It doesn't matter what happened. What
matters is what looks like what happened.

496
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:25,841
And what looks like what happened...
is pretty nasty.

497
00:35:25,883 --> 00:35:27,678
So what the hell do we do?

498
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:30,976
We gotta clean this mess up.

499
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:34,274
- Right now.
- OK.

500
00:35:37,822 --> 00:35:40,286
You shouldn’t be smoking anyway, Chloe.

501
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:41,371
It's not good for you.

502
00:35:41,455 --> 00:35:43,417
Fucking dying isn't good for you, either,

503
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:46,339
but that doesn't
seem to be stopping anybody!

504
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,012
We gotta get out of here. I mean,
what the hell are we still doing here?

505
00:35:50,055 --> 00:35:51,850
How are we gonna get outta here?

506
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:54,355
Dickwad over here sent Chuck off
with the truck!

507
00:35:54,396 --> 00:35:55,857
Well, then let's walk.

508
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:58,112
- 40 miles?
- You should have thought of that

509
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:01,034
- before you wore your stripper shoes.
- Will y'all just shut up?

510
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,414
Listen, we gotta work together, OK?

511
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,211
We never should’ve come out here.
Whose stupid idea was this?

512
00:36:06,253 --> 00:36:07,296
Chad!

513
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:14,352
You guys are all a bunch of fucking pussies,
you know that?

514
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:18,317
I mean, a few little tiny murders...

515
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:20,572
and everyone just freaks out.

516
00:36:21,782 --> 00:36:24,037
But do you know how lucky you all are, huh?

517
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,086
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you talking about, man?

518
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:32,136
How many people do you think
get a chance for something like this?

519
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:36,479
- The chance to die?
- The chance to live.

520
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,028
To be free from people always
telling you what you can and can't do.

521
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:44,576
There's no rules out here.
It's us against them.

522
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:48,960
And if you don't think
you can handle that, well...

523
00:36:50,756 --> 00:36:52,217
maybe you deserve to die.

524
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,352
That's fucked up.

525
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:02,236
Y'all hear that?

526
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,991
Chuck got the police!
Come on, you guys, let's go!

527
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:07,621
No, you don't need the fucking cops!

528
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:09,918
The cops aren't gonna help us, man.

529
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:14,969
Don't you fucking idiots know anything?

530
00:37:16,054 --> 00:37:17,098
Fuck.

531
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:25,698
Now, don't you worry.
Your friends are probably fine.

532
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,244
Probably just a little misunderstanding,
that's all.

533
00:37:28,286 --> 00:37:29,999
- Oh, God! Look out!

534
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,252
- Help us! Help us!
- Chloe?

535
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:33,547
They're dead!

536
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:35,008
They died!

537
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:36,844
Slow down, now.

538
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:39,140
- They killed them!
- OK.

539
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:45,068
Stay calm. Well, why don't you kids climb in
the back seat, and we'll go have a look?

540
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:50,871
Those stupid fucks.

541
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,306
I don't think I have the stomach for this, Tuck.

542
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:03,605
I know.
He's jammed in there pretty good.

543
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:08,614
- The store better not charge me for this!
- Yup.

544
00:38:08,656 --> 00:38:12,412
All right, look, I'm gonna wedge it from
that side, and you pull him out on three.

545
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:13,623
- OK.
- All right?

546
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:17,757
One. Two. Three!

547
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,176
Argh!

548
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,183
- Oh, Tuck! Oh, take it off! Take it off me!
- OK, help me get it off.

549
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,440
Get it off me. Not on the face!

550
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:29,320
Oh! I'm gonna barf.

551
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:32,577
You're OK, you're OK.

552
00:38:32,618 --> 00:38:35,416
- Here, grab a leg. Grab a leg.
- OK.

553
00:38:35,457 --> 00:38:36,669
Get him over to the truck.

554
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:41,428
Oh, God. Oh, God.

555
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:43,682
- He's heavy for half a guy.
- Oh, God.

556
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:52,157
Oh, shit.

557
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,296
- Let me do the talking.
- That's a good idea.

558
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,053
You kids stay put.

559
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,060
I'll handle this.

560
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,027
- Hey.
- Hello, Officer.

561
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:13,072
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah.

562
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:18,791
- We have had a doozy of a day.
- A real doozy.

563
00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:22,340
- Uh, there we were...
- Yup.

564
00:39:22,382 --> 00:39:24,636
- Minding our own business...
- Yup.

565
00:39:24,678 --> 00:39:27,684
- Making improvements to my house...
- The new house.

566
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:29,937
..when, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

567
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:34,781
these kids started killing themselves
all over my property.

568
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:38,328
This one right here, he dove headfirst
right into the wood chipper,

569
00:39:38,413 --> 00:39:39,665
the woody right back there.

570
00:39:39,707 --> 00:39:44,800
There's another one up over there
who shoved a spear through his gullet.

571
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,052
Straight through.

572
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:48,974
I don't know how much experience
you've had with this,

573
00:39:49,016 --> 00:39:52,480
- but we were scared shitless.
- Scared shitless.

574
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:05,465
You must think that I'm some
kind of moron to believe a story like that.

575
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,135
- No...
-Oh, no.

576
00:40:07,177 --> 00:40:10,516
- No, sir.
- Not a moron, just...open-minded.

577
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:14,941
Let me get this straight, cos I'm having
trouble understanding something.

578
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,367
- What?
- You say you were just working,

579
00:40:19,408 --> 00:40:25,586
when this...kid...ran up
and stuffed his head into that wood chipper?

580
00:40:25,628 --> 00:40:27,675
- That's a fact.
- That is a fact.

581
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:33,560
And I think maybe they might be
trying to kill the girl that we have inside.

582
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:35,063
- What girl?
- You know what?

583
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:38,529
She can maybe explain
the whole thing if, uh...

584
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,493
if I hadn't have knocked her
unconscious with a shovel.

585
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:43,997
- That's...
- On accident.

586
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,125
On accident.

587
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:49,466
You've got another one inside,
and you say she's unconscious?

588
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:52,597
- Yeah, she's in my bedroom.
- That's...

589
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:58,735
You better show me what you done with her.

590
00:40:58,776 --> 00:41:01,949
- Right this way. Let's show him.
- OK, I'm gonna put this leg down.

591
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:04,579
Great idea. Why don't you go and show him?

592
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,125
Wait, where is he going?

593
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:10,883
- No, don't go in there.
- Right this way, Sheriff.

594
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:17,019
What's he doing?

595
00:41:17,854 --> 00:41:19,608
Why doesn't he fucking arrest them?

596
00:41:26,914 --> 00:41:29,794
Her eyes are equal, reactive to light.

597
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:34,637
- At least she's not brain-dead.
- Oh, thank God.

598
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:39,062
I told you boys to stay away from this place,
but you just didn't listen, did you?

599
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:42,485
Now, you're looking at least two counts
of involuntary manslaughter,

600
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:44,615
but you'd be lucky to get that.

601
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:48,872
Officer, do we look like
a couple of psycho killers to you?

602
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,925
Well, it's... it's hard to say.

603
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:56,680
Looks can be deceiving.

604
00:41:56,721 --> 00:41:58,099
Oh, don't!

605
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,693
Sheriff! You OK?

606
00:42:06,282 --> 00:42:07,742
Oh, shit!

607
00:42:07,784 --> 00:42:10,456
- Come on!
- What is going on?

608
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:13,795
- How's he even walking, Tuck?
- He looks like he's gonna walk it off.

609
00:42:13,837 --> 00:42:15,382
He's gonna be fine.

610
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:23,063
Don't worry, I got it.

611
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:27,615
It's Sher... Sher...

612
00:42:29,284 --> 00:42:31,330
Oh, my God! They fucking killed him!

613
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:33,334
Unlock the door!

614
00:42:34,544 --> 00:42:38,260
God damn it, Tucker!
I told you we should have fixed that beam!

615
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:42,142
You are not putting this on me!
Do you understand me? This is your fault.

616
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,690
In there playing board games
with that little girl when I'm out working!

617
00:42:53,414 --> 00:42:55,376
Unlock the fucking door!

618
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:59,258
If you hadn't been playing
board games with that little girl inside,

619
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:02,265
we would have had
a little more time to fix the beam!

620
00:43:02,348 --> 00:43:03,433
Heads up.

621
00:43:03,517 --> 00:43:05,646
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
- No, no, no!

622
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:10,238
Oh, you got to take
the safety off on the side there.

623
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,079
Don't do...

624
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:16,584
Jesus! Oh, God!

625
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:20,674
You've got to start being more careful!

626
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,400
I don't think he understands!

627
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,993
"You gotta take the safety off"?

628
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:39,586
You're something, Dale. None of this
would have happened if it wasn't for you!

629
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:41,048
- What?
- That's right!

630
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:44,513
For being such a goddamn Good Samaritan!
"My God, she's drowning, Tucker.

631
00:43:44,597 --> 00:43:49,272
- "Oh, let's save her." Hell!
- Well, at least she's still alive.

632
00:43:49,314 --> 00:43:52,402
- Oh, halle-fuckin'-lujah!
- Don't you dare blame this on her!

633
00:43:52,444 --> 00:43:55,785
I'm not blaming this on her,
I'm blaming this on you!

634
00:43:55,826 --> 00:43:57,371
Well, you know what, Tucker?

635
00:43:57,412 --> 00:44:01,462
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't have gone fishin'!

636
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:04,259
- That isn't even an option.
- I don't even like fishin'!

637
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,804
You don't like...

638
00:44:08,016 --> 00:44:11,481
- What do you mean, you don't like fishin'?
- I-I mean...

639
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,694
I like... I like it OK.

640
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,031
You know... I'm sorry.

641
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:19,914
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.

642
00:44:21,543 --> 00:44:23,671
- Yeah, you kinda did.

643
00:44:24,756 --> 00:44:26,135
- Cut it out!

644
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:30,936
Tucker...

645
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:33,649
where's Jangers?

646
00:44:37,031 --> 00:44:38,659
- Shit.
- Stay here.

647
00:44:39,703 --> 00:44:40,830
Aah! Damn.

648
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:43,793
Nuts...

649
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:48,010
- Hey, hillbilly! Your move.

650
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,680
Oh, son of a bitch!

651
00:44:49,722 --> 00:44:52,185
- They got my dog.
- Shit!

652
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:54,439
We gotta do something.

653
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:58,071
- Did you bring that nail gun in here?
- Yeah. Why?

654
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:01,829
Stay low. Stay low to the ground.
Keep your hat!

655
00:45:09,927 --> 00:45:11,723
All right.

656
00:45:12,725 --> 00:45:14,896
- Cover me.
- Uh...

657
00:45:14,938 --> 00:45:17,066
I ain't never shot at nobody before.

658
00:45:18,026 --> 00:45:22,034
If it helps,
think of 'em like moving two-by-fours.

659
00:45:24,832 --> 00:45:28,088
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

660
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,216
Now, you create a distraction.

661
00:45:31,594 --> 00:45:33,598
I'm gonna go out the back door.

662
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,978
- And, Dale...
- Yeah.

663
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,188
Try not to shoot me.

664
00:45:38,566 --> 00:45:40,194
- OK, I'll try.
- All right.

665
00:45:40,236 --> 00:45:44,035
- What the fuck is taking so long?
- I don't know.

666
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,170
Hey, college kids! You want some of this?

667
00:46:10,628 --> 00:46:14,009
Ha-ha! You like that, college kids?
How's that taste?

668
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:17,809
I got plenty more where that came from!
Bunch of freaks!

669
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:23,946
Shit!

670
00:46:32,337 --> 00:46:35,885
Jesus, Dale. Take it easy.

671
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,013
Hey, hillbilly!

672
00:46:38,181 --> 00:46:41,772
You shoot at us again, and your dog's dead!

673
00:46:42,648 --> 00:46:46,573
If you kill my dog,
I swear to God, I'll get really mad!

674
00:46:46,614 --> 00:46:47,908
Then bring out the girl!

675
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:54,839
I'm gonna shoot your dog!

676
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:56,425
I'm gonna get really mad!

677
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:58,011
I'll get really mad!

678
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,230
Go home. Go!
No, you're going the wrong way, shithead!

679
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:12,206
It is a beautiful day for a run, isn't it?

680
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:15,787
Oh, God. Please, no.

681
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,764
Are we done yet?

682
00:48:25,847 --> 00:48:29,230
I don't know, Naomi, is it covered?
We may only get one chance at this.

683
00:48:29,313 --> 00:48:31,818
All right...trap's set.

684
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,368
Hey...he's awake.

685
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,380
What the hell is wrong with you kids?

686
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:45,009
What is the matter with us?

687
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:46,220
- Hold him steady.
- Yeah.

688
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:48,266
Wait. Stop...

689
00:48:51,523 --> 00:48:53,861
I've never stood so close to pure evil before.

690
00:48:59,453 --> 00:49:03,754
- It kind of stinks.
- It was supposed to be 24-hour protection...

691
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:05,382
OK! Don't...

692
00:49:05,465 --> 00:49:10,183
No, look, I know you kids are having fun,
but I am not a thrill-seeker!

693
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:13,023
It's payback time, hillbilly.

694
00:49:13,815 --> 00:49:18,532
Payback... All right, look.
Just let me go... Just let me go.

695
00:49:18,574 --> 00:49:20,453
I can get my cooler.

696
00:49:21,246 --> 00:49:24,085
Hey, I got 10 to 12 beers in there.

697
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,759
They're yours.
They're on ice right now, man!

698
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:31,015
- This is for Mike!
- No!

699
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:37,569
You prick.

700
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:46,254
- Dale?
- Allison.

701
00:49:47,046 --> 00:49:48,925
How are you feelin'?

702
00:49:50,762 --> 00:49:53,350
- A little fuzzy.
- Yeah.

703
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:56,564
Wha...

704
00:49:57,733 --> 00:49:59,070
What happ...

705
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:00,906
- What happened?
- Oh...

706
00:50:02,827 --> 00:50:03,996
Well, uh...

707
00:50:05,456 --> 00:50:07,711
I can't... I can't really say.

708
00:50:07,752 --> 00:50:08,839
Um...

709
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:12,512
It was so awful.

710
00:50:14,516 --> 00:50:16,979
Oh, my God. I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

711
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:19,776
- I can't cry in front of a girl, God damn it.
- That's OK.

712
00:50:19,818 --> 00:50:22,114
It's good to cry sometimes.

713
00:50:22,156 --> 00:50:24,201
It's OK, just...

714
00:50:24,243 --> 00:50:25,954
Just let it out. It's OK, all right?

715
00:50:29,252 --> 00:50:31,925
There you go. It'll feel better.

716
00:50:35,974 --> 00:50:37,393
Come on, just take a deep breath.

717
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:44,491
There we go. Now...

718
00:50:45,826 --> 00:50:47,287
Now tell me what happened.

719
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:51,964
Well...it's hard to say.

720
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:53,216
Um...

721
00:50:55,262 --> 00:50:56,514
Your friends...

722
00:50:57,683 --> 00:51:00,354
Do some of your friends take medication?

723
00:51:01,189 --> 00:51:03,945
- Why?
- Because I think they forgot to take it.

724
00:51:05,949 --> 00:51:08,870
What are you talking about?
What... Where are they?

725
00:51:08,954 --> 00:51:12,920
They're out there somewhere right now
tryin' to kill my best friend...and my dog.

726
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:15,509
- I don't understand what you're talking...
- I know.

727
00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:18,097
It doesn't make any sense.
That's what the truth is.

728
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:21,395
It's like all your friends just
decided to go nuts all at the same time.

729
00:51:21,437 --> 00:51:25,778
The last thing I remember, I saw...
I saw Chad and...

730
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:30,412
and then Todd was running at us, and...

731
00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:34,503
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

732
00:51:34,545 --> 00:51:36,842
At first I thought they were trying to kill you,

733
00:51:36,884 --> 00:51:42,101
and then they started killing themselves
and then they tried to kill us,

734
00:51:42,143 --> 00:51:44,356
and now they're going after my dog...

735
00:51:44,439 --> 00:51:45,900
..Jangers.

736
00:51:45,983 --> 00:51:48,113
I guess they just like killing.

737
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:51,578
No, there must be some kind of mistake.
My friends would never hurt anyone.

738
00:51:51,662 --> 00:51:53,374
Jesus, they're here!

739
00:51:53,415 --> 00:51:56,629
They're not gonna stop till they kill all of us,
I'm telling you. Hide!

740
00:51:56,671 --> 00:51:59,260
Dale, it's OK. Nobody wants to hurt you.

741
00:51:59,302 --> 00:52:01,807
- Die, hillbilly!
- It sure sounds like someone does.

742
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:04,269
I'm gonna go talk to them, OK?
Just stay there.

743
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:07,441
- What? No, no.
- It's all just a big misunderstanding.

744
00:52:07,484 --> 00:52:09,405
We’ll clear it right up, OK?

745
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:12,494
Allison, don't go out there!
You don't know what it's like out there.

746
00:52:17,044 --> 00:52:18,087
Oh, my God.

747
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,855
Allison!

748
00:52:47,394 --> 00:52:49,231
Did you see them?

749
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:53,656
- No.
- No?

750
00:52:57,581 --> 00:52:59,626
That's from Tucker's shirt.

751
00:53:01,755 --> 00:53:03,802
What is that?

752
00:53:03,843 --> 00:53:05,262
Oh, my God!

753
00:53:05,304 --> 00:53:08,059
Oh, my God!
They cut off his bowlin' fingers!

754
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:12,150
There's a note right there.

755
00:53:24,257 --> 00:53:28,223
"Now we got your friend. Try and get him!"

756
00:53:30,185 --> 00:53:33,400
Dale, how...
how long was I out for?

757
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:35,529
A few hours.

758
00:53:35,571 --> 00:53:37,283
I don't understand what...

759
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:38,827
I gotta go help Tucker.

760
00:53:38,869 --> 00:53:40,289
God damn it.

761
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:43,962
My best friend needs me.
I'm gonna get these kids.

762
00:53:44,045 --> 00:53:48,179
- Wait. We don't want to escalate things.
- We don't want to escalate things?

763
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,892
No. They must have thought
you were trying to harm me.

764
00:53:50,934 --> 00:53:52,937
Oh, and why would they think that?

765
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,321
I... I don't know.

766
00:53:58,114 --> 00:53:59,493
I think you do know.

767
00:53:59,534 --> 00:54:04,084
Well, when we first saw you guys
back at that store...

768
00:54:06,046 --> 00:54:08,634
we just thought that you looked...

769
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:10,597
a little creepy.

770
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:13,812
I was nervous.
I don't know how to talk to girls, and I...

771
00:54:13,853 --> 00:54:15,815
Dale, I know that now, but we didn't then.

772
00:54:15,856 --> 00:54:18,069
You thought I looked
like some kind of freak.

773
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:20,909
We misjudged you, Dale. I...

774
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,541
I'm really sorry.

775
00:54:24,582 --> 00:54:26,377
Don't be sorry. It's my fault.

776
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,261
I should have known that if
a guy like me talked to a girl like you,

777
00:54:31,345 --> 00:54:32,932
somebody'd end up dead.

778
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:36,230
Dale, it's... Dale, it's not like that.

779
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,776
If you do see your friends...

780
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:41,656
tell 'em that I never wanted to hurt anybody.

781
00:54:42,826 --> 00:54:45,372
Dale, Dale, stop. Wait. No...

782
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:46,624
Don't go there.

783
00:54:50,256 --> 00:54:52,177
Oh, shit.

784
00:54:52,218 --> 00:54:53,638
Tucker!

785
00:54:56,101 --> 00:54:58,355
- Tucker, you cut there?

786
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:06,705
Tuck!

787
00:55:27,913 --> 00:55:30,084
Oh, goddamn stupid college kids.

788
00:55:34,968 --> 00:55:36,178
Tucker!

789
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,851
- Dale!
- I'm comin' for you, buddy!

790
00:55:40,312 --> 00:55:41,731
Tucker?!

791
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:43,734
Yeah.

792
00:55:43,776 --> 00:55:45,405
Tuck! Tucker!

793
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:48,745
- Dale...
- Hey!

794
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,208
- Tucker.
- Dale, it's a trap.

795
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:53,796
- It's a what?
- It's a trap.

796
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,215
What?

797
00:55:56,259 --> 00:55:57,678
Oh, no. Oh, no! Tuck, no!

798
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,180
I don't wanna die! Please!

799
00:56:00,058 --> 00:56:03,106
Oh, God! Tucker!

800
00:56:03,148 --> 00:56:04,567
Dale...

801
00:56:11,456 --> 00:56:12,791
I never thought I'd say this,

802
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:14,628
but I'm glad I'm not hung like a bear.

803
00:56:14,669 --> 00:56:17,842
That's funny.

804
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:23,187
Dale...

805
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:26,818
that kid, he's got some serious issues.

806
00:56:26,902 --> 00:56:29,198
I know. Let's get you down from there.

807
00:56:29,281 --> 00:56:31,326
Wait!

808
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:32,747
Sorry about that.

809
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,500
This vacation sucks.

810
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:37,714
Come on, let's go.

811
00:56:56,835 --> 00:56:58,671
Look at this place.

812
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:04,140
- This is where evil lives.
- Let's just hope that Allison's still alive.

813
00:57:06,604 --> 00:57:07,856
Allison!

814
00:57:07,897 --> 00:57:09,442
- Allison!
- Chad?

815
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:12,323
- Chad?
- Shh!

816
00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:13,575
What are you guys doing?

817
00:57:13,658 --> 00:57:15,495
Saving you, stupid!
Come on. Let's go.

818
00:57:15,537 --> 00:57:18,752
Why are you whispering?
There's no one else here.

819
00:57:24,596 --> 00:57:26,516
This place is really freaky.

820
00:57:26,558 --> 00:57:29,230
What have they done to you, Allie?
Huh?

821
00:57:29,272 --> 00:57:31,443
They haven't done anything to me.

822
00:57:31,485 --> 00:57:33,739
Chad, this has all been
a huge misunderstanding.

823
00:57:33,781 --> 00:57:37,829
We have to burn this place to the ground.
Destroy it completely.

824
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,293
What? No, no. Chad...

825
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,381
Chad! Stop.

826
00:57:43,299 --> 00:57:45,220
No, Chad, no. Chad, stop!

827
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:50,355
You can't do this.
This is their vacation home.

828
00:57:50,397 --> 00:57:52,274
You guys have to listen to me, OK?

829
00:57:52,317 --> 00:57:56,908
Tucker and Dale did not mean
to hurt anyone. They're really nice.

830
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,954
You have no idea...

831
00:57:58,996 --> 00:58:02,336
what this is all about, do you, Allison?

832
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,173
- Huh?
- No.

833
00:58:05,843 --> 00:58:08,681
These freaks are evil...

834
00:58:09,558 --> 00:58:12,523
and they deserve everything
that's coming to them.

835
00:58:12,565 --> 00:58:14,735
OK, just relax, all right?

836
00:58:14,776 --> 00:58:18,241
I'm just trying to explain
this is all a big misunderstanding.

837
00:58:18,283 --> 00:58:21,247
Tucker and Dale have been nothing
but gentlemen to me this entire time,

838
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:24,546
- while you guys have been terrorizing them.
- But they started this!

839
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:27,676
By doing what? Saving my life?

840
00:58:28,762 --> 00:58:32,602
Wait a minute. I remember reading
about this in my sociology class.

841
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:34,315
It's called Stockholm syndrome.

842
00:58:34,357 --> 00:58:37,278
When someone who's been kidnapped
falls in love with their kidnapper.

843
00:58:40,242 --> 00:58:41,661
You're falling in love with him?

844
00:58:41,703 --> 00:58:44,041
No. W-What?

845
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:47,924
- Chad, the... The what? This is...
- Tell me...

846
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:52,724
you're not falling in love
with that freak, Allison.

847
00:58:54,144 --> 00:58:55,981
How could you love him?

848
00:58:57,651 --> 00:58:59,988
Chad, please. You don't understand.

849
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,869
Well, are you or are you not
in love with him?

850
00:59:02,911 --> 00:59:04,706
- What is the matter with you?
- Tell me!

851
00:59:05,749 --> 00:59:09,257
Hey! Let the girl go.

852
00:59:12,096 --> 00:59:15,936
- Are you OK, Allie?
- Allie? Did he just call you Allie?

853
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:20,153
Wait. Everyone just stop for a second
and let's talk this out, OK?

854
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:22,574
Nobody wants to hurt anyone.

855
00:59:22,615 --> 00:59:24,786
You could have fooled me.

856
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:27,374
- Fuck off, hillbilly.
- Eat shit, body perm.

857
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:30,381
Wait! How about I make some tea,

858
00:59:30,423 --> 00:59:33,303
and we all sit and talk this out?

859
00:59:33,344 --> 00:59:37,895
Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll provide the finger sandwiches.

860
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:40,651
I'm gonna go get a beer.

861
00:59:40,693 --> 00:59:44,408
OK, Chad, you...sit here, OK?

862
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,662
In this chair.

863
00:59:46,746 --> 00:59:48,332
Dale, you...

864
00:59:49,292 --> 00:59:51,088
you sit in this one.

865
00:59:58,602 --> 01:00:01,108
OK, good. Now, um...

866
01:00:01,984 --> 01:00:03,529
I'm gonna get the tea.

867
01:00:06,868 --> 01:00:10,291
Is that chamomile tea? I can't have that.
It fucks with my asthma.

868
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:11,961
It's Earl Grey.

869
01:00:12,002 --> 01:00:14,133
Oh, I love Earl Grey. That's great.

870
01:00:16,637 --> 01:00:21,229
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want you each to tell your side of the story,

871
01:00:21,271 --> 01:00:27,783
and as you're listening to the other person,
I want you to see yourself in their shoes.

872
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:28,910
OK?

873
01:00:31,457 --> 01:00:32,584
OK.

874
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:35,131
Now, it's important
that we communicate our feelings

875
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:39,097
and understand each other's perspective
before any progress can be made.

876
01:00:42,102 --> 01:00:43,146
OK.

877
01:00:43,522 --> 01:00:45,067
Chad, why don't you start?

878
01:00:46,653 --> 01:00:50,494
- Well, where should I fucking begin?
- Wherever you'd like.

879
01:00:51,412 --> 01:00:53,291
A long time ago,

880
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:56,590
- before I was born...
- OK, maybe not that far back.

881
01:00:56,632 --> 01:00:58,343
This is important.

882
01:01:01,306 --> 01:01:05,189
You see, my parents, they were attacked
by hillbillies just like him.

883
01:01:07,528 --> 01:01:09,907
It was 20 years ago.

884
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:11,743
The Memorial Day Massacre.

885
01:01:13,747 --> 01:01:17,212
They brutally murdered everyone.
Just for fun.

886
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:20,845
My mother ran for her life.

887
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,347
But they captured hen

888
01:01:31,282 --> 01:01:33,326
My father was helpless...

889
01:01:33,368 --> 01:01:37,042
and he didn't even know
that she was pregnant with me yet.

890
01:01:39,505 --> 01:01:41,342
And they forced him to watch...

891
01:01:42,595 --> 01:01:44,640
while they tortured hen

892
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:50,776
But my mom, she fought back...

893
01:01:51,905 --> 01:01:53,867
- ..and she escaped.

894
01:01:55,036 --> 01:01:57,373
But my father wasn’t so lucky.

895
01:02:02,258 --> 01:02:04,596
His body was never found.

896
01:02:11,943 --> 01:02:14,156
By the time I was born...

897
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:16,994
my mother was already institutionalized.

898
01:02:17,955 --> 01:02:21,294
I grew up hearing that story
from my grandmother.

899
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:30,521
OK. Um...

900
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,862
Thank you for sharing with us, Chad.

901
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:52,021
- No, I'm not going in there!
- Hey, hey, hey.

902
01:02:52,062 --> 01:02:55,694
Now, Chad said if they were
gone longer than 15 minutes,

903
01:02:55,736 --> 01:02:57,531
we come in, guns blazing.

904
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:02,415
- But you don't even have a gun.
- Damn it, woman! Don't argue with me!

905
01:03:12,185 --> 01:03:17,819
Are they drinking tea? Oh!
I would totally love a cup of tea right now.

906
01:03:18,989 --> 01:03:20,283
No!

907
01:03:20,325 --> 01:03:21,619
No way.

908
01:03:21,662 --> 01:03:23,831
They're fucking trapped.

909
01:03:23,873 --> 01:03:26,294
Oh...yeah.

910
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:29,342
Now, come on, we gotta do something.

911
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:33,893
It's your turn.

912
01:03:35,104 --> 01:03:37,525
OK, well...

913
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:40,154
First of all...

914
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:45,791
I am really sorry
that your family got massacred.

915
01:03:46,876 --> 01:03:48,129
That is awful.

916
01:03:48,254 --> 01:03:52,638
Secondly...
I didn't have anything to do with that, OK?

917
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:56,645
I mean, I would have been six years old
at the time, so...

918
01:03:56,729 --> 01:03:59,985
It may not have been you,
but it was definitely your kind.

919
01:04:00,027 --> 01:04:04,619
My kind? Now, hey, I can't even hurt a fish,
can I, Tucker? I can't even hurt fish.

920
01:04:04,661 --> 01:04:08,000
That's right.
He can't even hurt a fish.

921
01:04:08,043 --> 01:04:09,920
I just can't do it!

922
01:04:09,962 --> 01:04:14,138
OK. S-So now that you've both
expressed your side of the story,

923
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,559
how do you feel?

924
01:04:16,601 --> 01:04:19,397
I feel better. I feel...

925
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,610
I feel like a weight... Yeah, I feel good.

926
01:04:22,612 --> 01:04:26,161
Great. OK.
We're really making good progress.

927
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,210
It's show time, freaks!

928
01:04:30,878 --> 01:04:33,091
Jason! No!

929
01:04:35,512 --> 01:04:36,555
Jesus Christ!

930
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,943
Oh, shit, baby! Why didn't you duck?
Why didn't she duck?

931
01:04:44,153 --> 01:04:45,656
Chad, st...

932
01:04:46,324 --> 01:04:47,661
- Get him, Tucker!

933
01:04:49,622 --> 01:04:50,666
Dale!

934
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:55,383
Go back to hell where you belong, freak!

935
01:04:55,968 --> 01:04:57,888
Oh, shit!

936
01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:00,184
Shit! Chad, what the fuck?

937
01:05:00,226 --> 01:05:01,813
- Be calm. It's just the leg.
- Stop and roll.

938
01:05:01,855 --> 01:05:03,649
- I'm on fire!
- No, don't use that.

939
01:05:09,578 --> 01:05:10,830
Stop, drop, and roll!

940
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,253
- Get away from him!
- Stomp it out!

941
01:05:20,432 --> 01:05:22,728
He's crackling like a log!

942
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:24,064
Oh, that stinks.

943
01:05:26,903 --> 01:05:29,115
- Oh, shit!
- I knew I shoulda moved that.

944
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,669
- Allie, run!
- Run!

945
01:05:35,711 --> 01:05:36,755
Come on, let's go!

946
01:05:37,965 --> 01:05:39,969
Help me!

947
01:05:40,011 --> 01:05:42,058
Get off of me, you nasty bitch!

948
01:05:52,409 --> 01:05:53,872
My cabin.

949
01:05:54,832 --> 01:05:56,377
Your cabin.

950
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,965
I'm a terrible therapist.

951
01:05:59,048 --> 01:06:02,137
What? No, that's not true.
Don't say that.

952
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:04,560
I thought you did a great job in there.

953
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:06,729
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

954
01:06:07,982 --> 01:06:10,779
I think we were on the verge of a breakthrough.

955
01:06:12,198 --> 01:06:13,909
Thanks, Dale. That's really sweet.

956
01:06:13,951 --> 01:06:16,123
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah.

957
01:06:20,047 --> 01:06:22,342
I think we should go
to the pickup truck right now.

958
01:06:22,385 --> 01:06:24,180
Wait. Maybe we should help him.

959
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,524
- Argh!
- Never mind. Let's just go.

960
01:06:29,566 --> 01:06:31,444
Get to the truck!

961
01:06:31,486 --> 01:06:33,781
Tucker! Tucker!

962
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:37,247
He's coming!

963
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:41,839
- OK, come on, truck. Come on, truck.
- Come on, Dale. Go, go!

964
01:06:41,881 --> 01:06:44,469
- Do not flood it.
- Do you wanna drive?!

965
01:06:44,511 --> 01:06:46,473
- Guys, just go!
- Be careful with this.

966
01:06:46,515 --> 01:06:48,645
This is the only thing I got left.

967
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:51,441
Go.

968
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:59,916
Crazy college kid can't catch us now!

969
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:01,502
- Dale, look out!
- Huh?

970
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:18,910
Jangers, not now, boy.

971
01:07:18,994 --> 01:07:21,959
Jangers, hey!

972
01:07:23,795 --> 01:07:25,549
Whoa. Jangers!

973
01:07:27,093 --> 01:07:28,262
Allie.

974
01:07:29,139 --> 01:07:30,683
Allison!

975
01:07:31,936 --> 01:07:33,857
Jangers... Allison!

976
01:07:34,816 --> 01:07:36,068
She's gone.

977
01:07:36,111 --> 01:07:38,782
What the hell... Tucker?

978
01:07:41,621 --> 01:07:45,337
Tucker, what happened?
Tucker, what hap...

979
01:07:46,547 --> 01:07:48,509
He took her.

980
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:50,430
I tried to stop him.

981
01:07:50,472 --> 01:07:53,979
Whoa, take it easy.

982
01:07:54,021 --> 01:07:55,315
I tell you something, Dale.

983
01:07:55,398 --> 01:07:57,945
It's gonna be a long time
before I take a vacation again.

984
01:07:58,028 --> 01:08:01,910
Oh, shit. Tucker, this is all my fault.

985
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,750
- Look at you.
- Nah.

986
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:08,549
I never should have talked to Allison.
You were right.

987
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:10,719
People like me and people like her
just don't mix.

988
01:08:10,761 --> 01:08:12,931
- That's not true.
- It is true!

989
01:08:12,974 --> 01:08:15,729
I never should have even
came out here with you.

990
01:08:15,771 --> 01:08:17,942
Listen to me.

991
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:22,909
Do you remember when we was kids...

992
01:08:24,078 --> 01:08:26,375
and we used to go catch frogs
down at that creek?

993
01:08:26,417 --> 01:08:28,420
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.

994
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:33,847
Remember how we used to compete
to see who could catch more?

995
01:08:33,888 --> 01:08:37,228
Yeah, but I don't think now's
the time to talk about it, Tucker.

996
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:42,030
And I used to tell you that I let you catch
more than me because I felt sorry for you.

997
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:44,993
I remember you used
to let me lick 'em all, too.

998
01:08:45,035 --> 01:08:47,164
That always made me feel kinda funny.

999
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:49,544
Yeah. Well, the thing is...

1000
01:08:50,963 --> 01:08:52,884
I didn't let you catch more.

1001
01:08:53,844 --> 01:08:56,265
You caught 'em on your own.
You was quicker than I was.

1002
01:08:56,307 --> 01:08:58,353
- Come on, Tucker.
- It's true.

1003
01:08:58,394 --> 01:09:03,738
What I'm trying to tell you...
is that you're better than you think you are.

1004
01:09:04,865 --> 01:09:07,244
Listen to me. That girl sees it.

1005
01:09:08,288 --> 01:09:11,963
I've seen the way that the two of you
look at each other.

1006
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,179
You know, I think that she...

1007
01:09:17,264 --> 01:09:19,184
really sees you for who you are.

1008
01:09:20,771 --> 01:09:23,067
Who knows?
Maybe after this is all done...

1009
01:09:24,277 --> 01:09:25,572
you two can...

1010
01:09:26,532 --> 01:09:28,786
...date or something.

1011
01:09:28,828 --> 01:09:32,920
- I doubt it.
- Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

1012
01:09:32,962 --> 01:09:34,756
I don't want any more negativity.

1013
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:37,637
- OK.
- Stop it!

1014
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,058
- OK.
- You are a good man.

1015
01:09:41,019 --> 01:09:42,354
You're smart...

1016
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:44,901
and you're strong...

1017
01:09:45,945 --> 01:09:48,283
and you're not as ugly as you think you are.

1018
01:09:48,325 --> 01:09:52,498
Thank you, Tucker.
That means a lot comin' from you.

1019
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:55,255
- Life is short.
- I know.

1020
01:09:56,966 --> 01:10:00,431
You gotta go after what you want.
Go after her, Dale.

1021
01:10:00,514 --> 01:10:03,269
She needs you now more than ever,

1022
01:10:03,311 --> 01:10:07,737
especially cos she's always falling down
and hitting her head, knocking herself out.

1023
01:10:07,779 --> 01:10:11,702
- But I don't even know where he took her.
- Jangers'll know.

1024
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:18,216
- OK, but I'm not leaving you here.
- No, no, no.

1025
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:20,929
I'll be fine. Go.

1026
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:29,404
- Friends forever?
- Best friends forever.

1027
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:33,035
Oh, Jesus!

1028
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:34,747
- God! Fuck...
- I'm sorry.

1029
01:10:34,789 --> 01:10:36,417
OK.

1030
01:10:39,005 --> 01:10:40,634
That hurt very much!

1031
01:10:40,718 --> 01:10:42,972
I could tell. Just breathe in.

1032
01:10:43,013 --> 01:10:44,474
Out through your mouth.

1033
01:10:44,516 --> 01:10:46,437
Go get her. Go get her.

1034
01:10:48,106 --> 01:10:49,944
- Do me a favor.
- Anything.

1035
01:10:49,986 --> 01:10:53,074
Kick the shit out of that little
college dickhead for me, would you?

1036
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:56,706
I'm gonna shove my boot down
his fuckin' throat. You stay here, OK?

1037
01:10:56,748 --> 01:10:58,251
Come on, Jangers, let's go.

1038
01:11:19,249 --> 01:11:21,420
Good boy, Jangers. Good boy.

1039
01:11:21,504 --> 01:11:25,136
OK. You gotta let me take it from here, OK, pup?

1040
01:11:25,178 --> 01:11:28,309
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing.

1041
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:30,355
More or less. OK, stay.

1042
01:11:35,365 --> 01:11:36,992
What is the matter with you?

1043
01:11:37,034 --> 01:11:39,455
What is the matter with me?

1044
01:11:39,497 --> 01:11:43,964
Do you have any idea what
I've been through trying to save you?

1045
01:11:44,005 --> 01:11:45,050
No.

1046
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:48,013
You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison.

1047
01:11:49,266 --> 01:11:51,353
Now, I'm willing to forgive you...

1048
01:11:51,395 --> 01:11:53,441
but you're gonna have to beg.

1049
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:55,529
Chad...

1050
01:11:58,742 --> 01:12:00,036
Oh!

1051
01:12:01,038 --> 01:12:03,794
That was just not a very nice apology kiss.

1052
01:12:03,836 --> 01:12:06,508
You see, we're making up, Allie,

1053
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:08,596
so you have to be
more passionate than that!

1054
01:12:08,637 --> 01:12:10,223
- Chad, please...
- That's a start.

1055
01:12:10,265 --> 01:12:11,851
- Please...
- You're getting warmer.

1056
01:12:11,893 --> 01:12:13,229
Just stop, please!

1057
01:12:13,271 --> 01:12:15,775
No. I'm not gonna stop.

1058
01:12:15,817 --> 01:12:17,863
I've only just begun.

1059
01:12:41,785 --> 01:12:45,375
You want a killer hillbilly?
I'll show you a killer hillbilly.

1060
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:09,421
Allie! Allie! Hey, it's just me. Hey...

1061
01:13:09,462 --> 01:13:10,882
- It's OK.
- Dale?

1062
01:13:10,923 --> 01:13:12,636
- Yeah.
- What are you wearing?

1063
01:13:12,678 --> 01:13:16,017
What? Oh, I thought it might look
kind of intimidating. Does it?

1064
01:13:16,852 --> 01:13:18,898
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

1065
01:13:20,358 --> 01:13:23,365
Dale, you wanna...
you wanna help me here?

1066
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:25,160
Oh, yeah. Hang on, I'm comin'.

1067
01:13:26,495 --> 01:13:27,623
Hang on.

1068
01:13:30,127 --> 01:13:33,425
- OK, what do we got here?
- Thank you for coming for me.

1069
01:13:33,467 --> 01:13:36,724
It's no big deal.
I was headed over this way anyway, so...

1070
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:46,117
How sweet.

1071
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:51,001
The dim-witted hillbilly
is trying to save the girl of his dreams.

1072
01:13:51,043 --> 01:13:52,379
What kind of knot is this?

1073
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:55,175
You think you're gonna win,
but you're wrong.

1074
01:13:56,136 --> 01:13:58,891
It’s time to say goodbye to the girl.

1075
01:13:58,975 --> 01:14:01,104
You shouldn't have betrayed me, Allison.

1076
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:07,826
No. Oh, jeez. No, no!

1077
01:14:07,867 --> 01:14:09,495
- Oh, Dale! Dale!
- OK. OK.

1078
01:14:13,461 --> 01:14:14,755
- OK, OK.
- Dale!

1079
01:14:14,797 --> 01:14:17,760
Hold on! OK, rabbit comes out the tree,
rabbit goes around the tree...

1080
01:14:17,802 --> 01:14:19,849
- Dale, come on!
- OK! Jesus, OK!

1081
01:14:29,701 --> 01:14:31,580
Oh, that is really too bad.

1082
01:14:31,622 --> 01:14:36,172
Are you OK, huh?
Because I didn't mean to...

1083
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,392
Dale!

1084
01:15:01,888 --> 01:15:04,226
Dale!

1085
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:11,030
Dale!

1086
01:15:23,012 --> 01:15:25,267
It's time for you to feel my pain.

1087
01:15:26,477 --> 01:15:27,938
Bring it, frat bitch.

1088
01:15:51,025 --> 01:15:55,074
- Dale, over here!
- Come on! Let's get outta here.

1089
01:15:57,412 --> 01:16:00,335
Come on. Come on. Here! Come on!

1090
01:16:00,418 --> 01:16:03,632
Go! Go, get up there.
Go. Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

1091
01:16:05,844 --> 01:16:07,766
- Dale, here!
- Oh, yeah, give me that.

1092
01:16:09,143 --> 01:16:10,479
Put a couple boxes on there.

1093
01:16:10,521 --> 01:16:14,111
Oh, Jesus H Christ!
That kid is tough as nails.

1094
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:16,198
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1095
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,789
- OK. OK.
- Looks like no one's been here for a while.

1096
01:16:19,831 --> 01:16:22,794
Yeah. What we need to find
is some kind of weapon,

1097
01:16:22,836 --> 01:16:26,259
something preferably big and sharp
so I can stab him!

1098
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,721
Nah! Shit...

1099
01:16:27,762 --> 01:16:31,019
Oh, hey! This might work, huh?

1100
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,104
Or not.

1101
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:41,789
Oh, my God. Dale?

1102
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,002
- What?
- Come here and look at this.

1103
01:16:47,216 --> 01:16:48,260
Look.

1104
01:16:48,302 --> 01:16:50,389
- What?
- Something look familiar?

1105
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:54,189
- Hey, ain't that that dead Sheriff right there?
- No, that picture.

1106
01:16:54,230 --> 01:16:57,528
- Look at the guy in the middle.
- Oh, yeah.

1107
01:16:57,570 --> 01:17:00,742
He looks just like that
Kentucky fried college kid down there.

1108
01:17:00,784 --> 01:17:02,579
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

1109
01:17:02,621 --> 01:17:07,339
And it says here, "The single survivor
leads police to the Memorial Day Killer.

1110
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:11,096
"The survivor is reported
to have been tortured and raped.

1111
01:17:11,137 --> 01:17:13,851
"She's now undergoing
psychiatric evaluation."

1112
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:19,070
Think about it. He said his mother
was captured and his father...

1113
01:17:19,112 --> 01:17:21,282
His father's body was never found.

1114
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:24,790
I think we've just found him.

1115
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:27,001
Holy S-H-I-T.

1116
01:17:27,043 --> 01:17:29,089
Jesus Christ!

1117
01:17:29,131 --> 01:17:30,717
Chad!

1118
01:17:32,929 --> 01:17:35,016
- Time to die, freak!
- Wait!

1119
01:17:35,058 --> 01:17:36,395
Just wait! Wait, wait!

1120
01:17:36,437 --> 01:17:38,149
Wait, Chad! Wait!

1121
01:17:38,858 --> 01:17:40,528
- You're a hillbilly, too!
- Shut up!

1122
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:42,197
No! Look!

1123
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,285
That's your real father.
Right there!

1124
01:17:45,495 --> 01:17:47,207
No. No!

1125
01:17:47,249 --> 01:17:49,295
It's true, Chad. You're half hillbilly.

1126
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,595
It can't be.

1127
01:17:56,725 --> 01:17:58,772
They lied to me!

1128
01:18:00,274 --> 01:18:02,320
How could they?

1129
01:18:02,361 --> 01:18:04,282
Maybe they didn't want you
to know the truth.

1130
01:18:04,365 --> 01:18:06,160
There is no truth!

1131
01:18:06,828 --> 01:18:09,459
Everything is a lie!

1132
01:18:13,257 --> 01:18:15,678
- What did you do?
- Anthemis nobilis.

1133
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,016
- What?
- It's the ingredient in chamomile tea

1134
01:18:18,058 --> 01:18:22,526
that causes an anaphylactic reaction
in rare cases where people are allergic to it.

1135
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:24,488
Like I said, I remember weird stuff.

1136
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:27,535
But he'll be OK,
as long as we get him his inhaler.

1137
01:18:34,841 --> 01:18:36,427
Or not.

1138
01:18:46,363 --> 01:18:48,993
OK, here we go. And, you ready?

1139
01:18:49,034 --> 01:18:52,291
- Uh, yeah, wait. My teeth. Do I got any...
- Teeth are clear.

1140
01:18:52,332 --> 01:18:54,880
- Clear? OK, just give me a second.
- And we're rolling.

1141
01:18:58,386 --> 01:19:02,603
The chaos and confusion
of what transpired here last night

1142
01:19:02,644 --> 01:19:04,356
is still being unraveled.

1143
01:19:04,398 --> 01:19:07,112
What appears to be a tragic mass suicide

1144
01:19:07,154 --> 01:19:10,619
involving a group of
mentally unstable college kids

1145
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:15,795
may in fact be the work of a lone deranged
killer whose body has yet to be found.

1146
01:19:15,837 --> 01:19:19,677
- The killings happened on the ....
- Knock knock. Hey!

1147
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:24,603
- Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
- I'm feeling...

1148
01:19:25,313 --> 01:19:27,067
high on prescription medication.

1149
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:29,321
Yeah, looks like it.

1150
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:31,867
They found my fingers.

1151
01:19:32,827 --> 01:19:34,247
Check it out.

1152
01:19:34,288 --> 01:19:36,334
- Yeah.
- I got to tell you...

1153
01:19:37,671 --> 01:19:39,883
I don't remember that one looking that way.

1154
01:19:39,925 --> 01:19:42,137
Does that look funny to you?

1155
01:19:42,179 --> 01:19:43,557
No. No, not really.

1156
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:47,524
That looks natural. It's good.

1157
01:19:47,566 --> 01:19:49,485
By the way, I brought you something.

1158
01:19:49,527 --> 01:19:51,614
- Shut your eyes, OK?
- All right.

1159
01:19:51,656 --> 01:19:53,242
OK, open them.

1160
01:19:54,244 --> 01:19:55,914
Oh...

1161
01:19:55,956 --> 01:19:58,168
- Oh, buddy.
- That's a PBR, buddy.

1162
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,300
That...
that's a thing of beauty.

1163
01:20:01,383 --> 01:20:03,012
- It's cold, too, should be.
- Oh, oh...

1164
01:20:03,053 --> 01:20:04,431
Look what else I got you.

1165
01:20:04,514 --> 01:20:07,269
A bendy straw,
your favorite sipping utensil.

1166
01:20:07,352 --> 01:20:09,356
There you go.

1167
01:20:09,398 --> 01:20:11,737
Mmm. Mm!

1168
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:14,951
Don't choke. I'm gonna let you rest.
You enjoy that, OK?

1169
01:20:14,993 --> 01:20:17,873
Drink the whole thing.
When I come back, I'm gonna have more.

1170
01:20:17,915 --> 01:20:19,250
- Dale?
- Yeah?

1171
01:20:20,002 --> 01:20:21,464
Did you ask her?

1172
01:20:22,925 --> 01:20:26,933
- Ask her what?
- Did you ask her out, for God's sake?

1173
01:20:26,974 --> 01:20:29,729
Oh. Well ...

1174
01:20:31,231 --> 01:20:34,822
I was gonna, but then
I never actually got the chance, so...

1175
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:35,908
Dale!

1176
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:39,081
You are hopeless,
you know that? You're hopeless.

1177
01:20:39,122 --> 01:20:43,340
Yeah. You're probably right about that.

1178
01:20:44,299 --> 01:20:45,551
Except for...

1179
01:20:45,635 --> 01:20:49,935
she kinda mentioned to me
that she's a pretty darn good bowler, so...

1180
01:20:49,977 --> 01:20:51,020
we're goin' bowling.

1181
01:20:53,484 --> 01:20:56,114
- You little dickhead.
- I'm outta here.

1182
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:02,918
Whoo! Yes.

1183
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,428
- Dale Dobson, you are one lucky man.
- I guess it's just beginner's luck.

1184
01:21:07,469 --> 01:21:10,892
That girl has got an amazing set...
of bowling fingers.

1185
01:21:10,934 --> 01:21:14,232
I know.
Listen, let me tell you something, OK?

1186
01:21:14,274 --> 01:21:17,113
Life is short, BJ.
You have to go after what you want,

1187
01:21:17,155 --> 01:21:19,993
because it sure as heck fire
ain't gonna just fall right into your lap.

1188
01:21:20,035 --> 01:21:22,582
- You know somethin'? You're right.
- I know.

1189
01:21:22,665 --> 01:21:25,503
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- OK. Right, now, listen to me, though.

1190
01:21:25,587 --> 01:21:28,134
Don't be nervous, and just be yourself, OK?

1191
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:29,428
Yeah.

1192
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:31,390
You got 'er. Go, buddy.

1193
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,103
Hey.

1194
01:21:34,145 --> 01:21:36,859
- I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
- You are. That was great.

1195
01:21:36,901 --> 01:21:41,368
Listen, Allie, I hope you don't think
this is too stupid or whatever,

1196
01:21:41,409 --> 01:21:43,497
but I got you a little something.

1197
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:47,045
Dale, that's so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

1198
01:21:47,087 --> 01:21:48,382
I know. I wanted to.

1199
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:51,262
Oh, my gosh.

1200
01:21:51,304 --> 01:21:55,186
- You know what that is?
- Yes, it's a... it's a helmet.

1201
01:21:55,228 --> 01:21:56,814
It's a pink helmet.

1202
01:21:56,855 --> 01:22:00,530
I think, you know, it might just be better if
you wear that every day from now on, so...

1203
01:22:00,614 --> 01:22:02,575
- OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1204
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:04,078
It's perfect.

1205
01:22:05,748 --> 01:22:07,501
So, listen, Dale, I'm, uh...

1206
01:22:07,584 --> 01:22:10,675
I'm really sorry about
everything that happened.

1207
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:13,304
What do you mean?
For what? I had a great time.

1208
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:17,396
I mean, except for all the people dying, when
they were bleeding on us and everything.

1209
01:22:17,438 --> 01:22:20,484
That wasn't so much fun,
but...you know...

1210
01:22:21,487 --> 01:22:23,616
I enjoyed every minute
I got to spend with you.

1211
01:22:23,658 --> 01:22:26,371
- Dale...
- You know what? Let me just say this,

1212
01:22:26,413 --> 01:22:31,005
cos I don't know if we're ever gonna get
to spend this kind of time together again,

1213
01:22:31,047 --> 01:22:32,676
and I want to let you know that I...

1214
01:22:34,637 --> 01:22:36,266
I feel the same way.

1215
01:22:38,519 --> 01:22:40,565
- Really?
- Really.

1216
01:22:42,694 --> 01:22:44,323
BJ!

1217
01:22:45,993 --> 01:22:48,664
Oh, my God, should we go help her?

1218
01:22:48,706 --> 01:22:49,792
Hell, no.

1219
01:22:55,135 --> 01:22:56,179
Whatever.

1220
01:22:57,305 --> 01:23:57,250

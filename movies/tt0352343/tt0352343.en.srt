2
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,760
You've been weird since we left
the market, what's wrong?

3
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,400
Nothing! Does there have to be
something wrong?

4
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
We've been out for an hour
and you haven't said a word!

5
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,040
We got the groceries, came
downtown and you're silent!

6
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,400
If you're mad at me, say so.
Stop wearing that face

7
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,920
I'm not making a face, you're
the one who's always pissed off

8
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
Let's go over there

9
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,680
If l'm mad I don't shut up
and hold it in like you!

10
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,040
Oh sure, you're always right,
l forgot

11
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,920
I'm not always right,
but I am this time

12
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
Come on, you like to fight

13
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
You could stick up for me
just once!

14
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,600
You made a scene because she
cut into the line

15
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,160
- But she was ahead of us!
-When l tried to apologize,

16
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,880
she jumped on me like a maniac
and you kept quiet!

17
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,120
What was I supposed to do?

18
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,320
You don't see the face you make
when l talk to people

19
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,200
-You're ashamed of me
-Whatare you talking about?

20
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,040
You were screaming. Even the
cashier said you were wrong

21
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,400
Did you see how she pointed
that pencil at me?

22
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,200
Yes, but you didn't need
to tell her where to shove it

23
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,360
Okay, maybe I went too far.
Then she asked the Romanian

24
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,560
if she had enough money to pay.
What a racist!

25
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,920
Listen, put that money away.
There are people around...

26
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,120
He's lost.
He can't remember his own name

27
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,520
Maybe he's got I.D.

28
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,360
Do you have an identity card?
No, not money, identification

29
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,240
-What about in his pockets?
-What, should l frisk him?

30
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm very confused...

31
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,120
I don't remember anything

32
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,880
Put your money in your pocket

33
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,120
Give it a minute,
you'll remember

34
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,320
-We can't just leave him!
-What can we do about him?

35
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,680
He's following us!

36
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,040
- He's not following us
-Yes, he is!

37
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,800
Don't worry

38
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,200
We'll take you to the police
station near our house

39
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,080
They'll know what to do

40
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,360
You know how many people
get lost? A whole lot, right?

41
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,440
There's a game on TV tonight

42
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,120
What team do you like?

43
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,600
- Okay, so you don't like soccer
- Stop it now!

44
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,000
Hey, can you give me a hand?

45
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,680
No, you stay in the car.
I'll get it

46
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,960
- Ma, Martina broke my Game Boy
- It's not true, Microbe did it

47
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,040
- Hurry up, don't stop to chat
- Hi, kids

48
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
- I'Il help, Mama, give me one
-Martina, you're in my way

49
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,440
-Who's that man?
- I have no idea, he's lost

50
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,080
You know Filippo and how he can
complicate life

51
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,520
-Where did you find him?
- Downtown.

52
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,520
-Just what you need
-Wait, don't puIl me

53
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,560
Microbe,
stop yelling on the stairs!

54
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,920
-Where's Papa?
-Go watch TV with him

55
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,280
-Who was that man?
- I'm in no mood, Martina, go

56
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,120
I don't feeI Iike watching TV

57
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,920
Detergent on the right,
all spray bottles on the left

58
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,240
This kid is getting
more obsessive than you are!

59
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,560
Order makes life easier
and doesn't make you waste time

60
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,280
You're the one
making me waste time

61
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,160
l toId you, go inside
and watch television!

62
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,520
Martina, can you hear me?

63
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,880
I told you,
I don't feeI like watching TV

64
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,760
Was she born that way
or did she grow into it?

65
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
I don't know

66
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,880
- Giovanna, he's undressing!
- Getaway from there!

67
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,040
He's almost naked! Come before
he closes the shades

68
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,960
Will you stop that?

69
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,240
Okay, enough already!

70
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,400
Open up, Vittorio!
Leave Luciana alone!

71
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,960
I'll call the cops this time!

72
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,920
Open the door right now!

73
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,960
Busybody!

74
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,680
I told you, l don't want you
involved! Go away!

75
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,320
Mind your own fucking business,
bitch, or I'll call the cops!

76
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,920
I'll have you and that illegal
immigrant who fucks you arrested

77
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,680
Get out of here!

78
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,360
He was kidding

79
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
Giambo!

80
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,200
- Giambo!
-What is it?

81
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,760
Vittorio called me a bitch

82
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,240
- He called you a dirty nigger
- I'll take care ofit

83
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,800
- He didn'tsay that!
- He thought it! Be quiet!

84
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,880
Open the door, asshole!

85
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,480
- It's about time!
- The game started, right?

86
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,200
Papa's home! Hi, Papa!

87
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,720
Will you eat with us
or take your plate next door?

88
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
Good evening

89
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,520
- Filippo!
- I'll take him after the game

90
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,240
l don't believe it!
You brought him back here!?

91
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,680
There were too many people,
we waited an hour!

92
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,880
They want to know how I found
him and bullshit like that

93
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,920
- There, only one point!
-What an imbecile...

94
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,840
Eat

95
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,960
-Would you like some more?
-Yes

96
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,400
- Mama?
-Why are you awake?

97
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
Maybe Simone is dead

98
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,840
-Simone?
- The man in there!

99
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
- How do you know his name?
- He told me

100
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,880
He got his memory back

101
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,960
He told your daughter
that his name is Simone

102
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,160
He's asleep
from overexertion

103
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,520
Did he just tell you
or did you ask him?

104
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,840
-Why are you whispering?
- So l don't wake him up

105
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,280
If you let him sleep, will you
carry him out ofhere?

106
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,240
Sir? Simone?

107
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,960
You have to wake up.
We have to go, wake up

108
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,040
No, Filippo!
You're not leaving him here!

109
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,120
- He could be a maniac!
-You're exaggerating, Giovanna

110
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,920
He'll sleep near the kids!
You're crazier than he is!

111
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,680
Stop yelling

112
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,240
I'll yell when I want to!
Watch how he wakes up now!

113
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,440
Great, he made himself
comfortable now

114
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,080
-You resolve this situation!
- Look! You made him cry!

115
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,640
Stop that tone
or I'll smack you one!

116
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,240
And I'll report you to a cop!

117
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,720
Are you coming to bed?

118
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,080
He's sleeping.
l put Mama's blanket on him

119
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
Turn out the light,
l'm coming

120
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,000
- Go to sleep!
- l'd go to sleep,

121
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,360
- but this guy's awake!
- I don't feel like it

122
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,400
We sleep together once a week
and you don't feel like it?

123
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,760
No, leave it open. l don't
trust that man in there

124
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,320
- No, he'll hear us this way
-We'll do it with a silencer

125
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
- l really don't feel like it
-Come on, sure you do!

126
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,000
Good morning!

127
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,120
-Why didn't you wake me up?
-You were sleeping so nicely

128
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Look Mama,
Simone made breakfast

129
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,880
-Where is he now?
- He's in there

130
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,480
He made a mess with the eggs,
sure he's better, right?

131
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,960
Have a crepe

132
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,080
- No, l don't want anything
- l helped him, you didn't!

133
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,840
Martina, go do your notebook

134
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,800
Yeah, and do Marco's too!

135
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,200
Remember, they
get out of school at two today

136
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,440
-What time do you start?
-At seven, like always

137
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,040
- Haven't they changed the shifts?
-Sure they have

138
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,040
lt's just that they gave me
the night shiftagain

139
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,360
-You always get cheated
- I was the last guy hired

140
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
l have to hurry now,
I hate doing things in a rush!

141
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,920
He's in there

142
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,920
He's going, today

143
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,080
I'll take care of it

144
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Today

145
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,080
Don't worry, I promise

146
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,680
What's wrong?

147
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,400
- Have you seen Chen Suilan?
-Why?

148
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,520
- Have you seen her?
- Sure, don't you see her too?

149
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,000
- That's not her
-What's the difference?

150
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,520
-What happened to Chen Siulan?
- She works two jobs,

151
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,920
her sister replaces her
and she has no working papers.

152
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,680
The bosses know this trick of using
the same name for relatives who come

153
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,400
- It doesn't work anymore!
-What are you, an SS officer?

154
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,960
-They asked me to investigate
-You tell them it's not your job

155
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,720
You do the accounting.
What does that mean?

156
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,080
-You count people?
- How can I say no to them?

157
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,640
With your mouth!

158
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,280
Hi!

159
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,440
Hi Mama,
look what we got

160
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,360
-What's all this?
-Wait or I'll crash

161
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,080
-What have you done?
- I'll explain later

162
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,200
- How about explaining now?
-Are you happy now?

163
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,920
- No, I'm playing!
- Let Marco play too

164
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,080
No, he doesn't know howto play

165
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,920
- l didn't buy it, okay?
-You took money from that man?

166
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,480
- No, he gave it to me
-You know what that's called?

167
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,840
- Exploiting the vulnerable
- Don't yell, he'll hear you!

168
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,040
He'll hear me?

169
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,920
Why the fuck didn't you
bring him to the police today?

170
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,640
l did and I made a report.
I just couldn't leave him there

171
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,800
- How much did you take?
-They'll call and let us know

172
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,880
l didn't take his money, are
you crazy? He came with me

173
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,960
to get the kids from school and
he wanted to buy them a gift

174
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,960
He told Martina to pick one,
you know how grand she is

175
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,080
Yes, but you've really lost the plot!
l can't sleep with him here

176
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,920
Take him to the pub and leave
him at the station on the way

177
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,040
Sure! This way I'm always
the one who's the shit!

178
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,920
They're not for us,
l sell them

179
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,440
-Are you a pastry maker?
- To earn some extra money

180
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,600
l make them twice a week
for my friend who owns a pub

181
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,960
But l'd have liked that

182
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,080
l would have liked
to open a pastry shop

183
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
Why didn't you?

184
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,280
I didn't have the money

185
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,400
You could work in a pastry shop
if you like it that much

186
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,280
Sure, at 29 years old with
2 kids, I'd be an apprentice

187
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,200
with a husband who gets himself
fired all the time

188
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,280
I know it's hard to quit,
but at least when you bake

189
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,840
you shouldn't smoke.
You used

190
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,040
tap water
and you didn't even taste it

191
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,680
to make sure
there wasn't too much chlorine

192
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,880
Pardon me. I'll use
mineral water next time

193
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,960
Do you have a favorite brand
to suggest?

194
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,960
You'll find the right one.
Try it when it's cold

195
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,080
and when it's heated.
The water must always be clear,

196
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,120
have no smell,
be pleasant to the taste

197
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,240
and be absolutely low
in alkaline

198
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,920
How do you know all this?

199
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,920
Maybe I knew someone...

200
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,160
who knew how to bake very well

201
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,960
Then you must remember
something

202
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,520
lf I'm late
at the police station,

203
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,320
would you put my kids to bed
after yours?

204
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,120
-Want Giambo to go with you?
- He is just what l need...

205
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,920
I'll take two minutes,
wait for me here

206
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,760
No, you could have brought them
a little later

207
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,440
for closing time!

208
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,600
Sorry, I'll bring them early
next time, life is a mess at home

209
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,600
Send your husband if you're in
a mess, or don't you trust him?

210
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,920
lt's you I don't trust!
He works nights anyway, so...

211
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,040
Excuses, excuses. If I had the
chance, I'd show him a good time

212
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,000
Do it! You'd get him off
my back then!

213
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,440
- Trouble is, he'd never do it
- Oh yes he would

214
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,000
- lsn't Giorgio enough for you?
-Still?

215
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,320
After 15 years,
it's incest now

216
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
- Irene, the cash register
- I'm coming!

217
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,320
I can't,
I'm in a rush

218
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,000
Relax a bit or your brain
will blow up, honey

219
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,080
By the way, the pies
aren't selling very well

220
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,400
What can I do foryou then?

221
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,920
That's my favorite question.
Make sure it's good

222
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,080
Be serious,
tell me what you want

223
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,400
How should I know?
Invent something, shock me

224
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,840
Make something new

225
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,280
You think that's easy.
'Bye

226
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,400
Pardon me, I think your
grandfather isn't feeling well

227
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,280
I was standing by him and he
was saying some strange things

228
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,840
-Then he walked off
- He's not my grandfather

229
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,600
Sorry, it's just that
I saw him with you before...

230
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,600
I live in the building
across from you

231
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,240
Really?

232
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,320
l don't know who he is,
we found him in the street

233
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,720
The police said
they'd inform us

234
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,920
if they find out anything

235
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,640
Where did he go now?

236
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,160
I met him
there in front of my car

237
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,920
Excuse me, but you took him
to the police

238
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,840
and they left him
in your care?

239
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,920
- Impossible, right?
- lt seems a bitstrange to me

240
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,720
You're right. I wasn't the one
who brought him anyway

241
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,680
Well, he can't be too far

242
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,840
He's not well

243
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,840
-What's wrong with him?
- His memory is gone

244
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,640
What's the name?

245
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,080
Giovanna

246
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,280
I'm Lorenzo.
But, I meant his name

247
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,000
Oh! Simone

248
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,080
l should have taken him to the
police before going to the pub

249
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,120
Now what can l do with him...

250
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,760
l can't chase him around
all night

251
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,880
You've been very kind,

252
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,480
but I'd better go home now

253
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,000
Simone, what are you doing?
Why did you get out of the car?

254
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,400
My life is already a mess,
you are just what I need!

255
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,160
Come back to the car

256
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,920
I'll take you where you want

257
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,760
We can go ask again,
maybe they've found out

258
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,360
-where you lives
- I'll take you there

259
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,880
No, thanks anyway.

260
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,680
My car is right here.
Two people are better than one

261
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,160
l'm sorry, I'm taking up
so much of your time

262
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,600
Don't worry about it,
I'm not working tomorrow

263
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,160
- They're coming!
-Who's coming?

264
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,360
Don't get upset

265
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,960
- Let me out. l have to get out!
- No! Whatare you doing?

266
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,440
Simone, wait!

267
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,960
- I'll go with him
- Okay, I'll catch up

268
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,400
No, please! Let me go!

269
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,240
Lorenzo! He's not feeling well!

270
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,400
Simone, what's wrong?

271
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,360
Nothing

272
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,320
I just need...
to sit down for a bit

273
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,080
Good evening, Mario.
I'll have the usual, please

274
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,680
- Sorry, I'm not Mario
- Then have Mario come

275
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,720
No one named Mario works here

276
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,080
-What do you usually have?
-Vermouth

277
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,320
- I'll have a beer, please
- Make that two

278
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,560
Who are you?

279
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,320
Lorenzo. We were in the car
together just now

280
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,920
We met in front of the pub,
remember?

281
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,880
No.
What kind of work do you do?

282
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,080
l work in a bank

283
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,680
Do you like it?

284
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,120
I guess so. I'm about to become
a branch manager

285
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,240
Your wife will be pleased

286
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,400
Well...l'm not married

287
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,400
You're not married at your age?
Why not?

288
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,240
I don't know

289
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,440
Maybe I haven't found
the right person yet

290
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,360
What about you?

291
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,080
-What about me?
- Do you like your job?

292
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,200
- Do you like chicken?
-Yes, it's alright

293
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,760
l work in a chicken factory

294
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,760
l'm in accounting.
And l don't like it

295
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,960
I like your cakes very much.
The ones you bring to the pub

296
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,200
How did you know I make them?

297
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,800
I've seen you quite often
and I go to the pub a lot

298
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,960
And like I told you,
I live across from you

299
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,920
You've never seen me?

300
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,200
Maybe l have

301
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,040
Maybe in the neighborhood

302
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,960
Or maybe from my window

303
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,080
I don't know, what with
everything I have to do...

304
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,200
- Sir?!
-Oh, excuse me

305
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,920
Have you seen Sara? They're
even taking babies away!

306
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,160
Please help me find her,
please!

307
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,240
Help me find her

308
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,880
Remember to take the money
out of your jacket

309
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,720
These are Filippo's.
They might be small for you

310
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,160
Ijust need time to wash
your things, put them here

311
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,800
I don't like the sweater

312
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,320
You haven'teven tried it on

313
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,760
I don't like the color

314
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,000
Alright, I'll get another one
for you

315
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,920
This robe is for you...
it's blue!

316
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,080
I'll take your clothes
to the cleaners tomorrow

317
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,240
Do you understand?

318
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,680
- Hello?
-Giovanna? lt's Lorenzo

319
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,720
Sorry to call so late,
but I looked up your number

320
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,200
and l saw you were still awake

321
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,720
Yes

322
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,720
After I left you at your car,
I lost you and

323
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,600
I just wanted to know
if he's alright

324
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,120
Yes, he's taking a shower

325
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,680
I couldn't...
I couldn't tell you before

326
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
what he said to me
when he stopped me

327
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,920
So, here we are

328
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,880
My friends had gone
and I was getting into my car

329
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,120
At a certain point,
he was almost on top of me

330
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,360
He spoke to me...as if
he were talking to someone else

331
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,000
He...it was actually as if
he were declaring his love

332
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,000
I don't remember
the words exactly now

333
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,200
''I'll always love you''

334
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,640
More or less
that's what he said

335
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,000
And then?

336
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,440
''We have to love each other
secretly,''

337
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,040
''because no one...no one
will forgive our love''

338
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,880
What did you answer?

339
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,400
l didn't know what to say

340
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,080
It was a bit embarrassing too

341
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,280
Then he just stopped.
He looked me in the eyes

342
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,440
''l don't want to give up
our love. Do you?''

343
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,760
He really said that?

344
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,600
Yes

345
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,400
For a moment I was...
I tried to give him an answer

346
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,720
Any answer. I don't know
how he took it

347
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,160
You didn't understand
who he was talking to?

348
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,600
No, but he was convinced he was
talking to the person he loved

349
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,280
So he wasn't talking
about me...l mean

350
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,920
about her. About the woman

351
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,320
that he couldn't love

352
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,720
What was he thinking about?

353
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,200
Who knows how it ended...

354
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,280
Take him to the police tomorrow

355
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,080
Yes, l have to take the kids
to school and shop, but...

356
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,920
You can always call if
you need a hand. I'll give you

357
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,960
- my mobile number
-Alright

358
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,560
Is everything alright?

359
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,640
Is everything alright?

360
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,920
Listen, I'm coming in

361
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
What are you doing?

362
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,160
You couldn't sleep?

363
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,560
You couldn'teither

364
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,080
Did the children stay
with your friend?

365
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,200
Yes, but Emine's kids
sleep here often too

366
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,720
I like the way your husband
plays with his children

367
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,760
Yes, Filippo is a good father

368
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,080
Have you known him long?

369
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,920
We've been married for 9 years,
but were together before that

370
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,520
It was different
in the beginning. Then...

371
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,400
Then the worries, the children,
like everyone else l guess

372
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,160
It must be beautiful to watch
love grow that started only as

373
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,440
passion...
and to help it change,

374
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,880
to protect it
from the passage of time

375
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,880
Well,
that's not always easy

376
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,160
Do you like to dance?

377
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,720
Yes, but I haven't danced
for years

378
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,480
lt's been longer for me

379
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,560
- Martina, hurry up
-We'll be ready in two minutes

380
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,320
-What time is it?
-Too early for you

381
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,000
I'll take the kids to school
and then go shopping with Emine

382
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,240
I swear I'll leave him
at the police station today

383
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,240
No, I have to take his clothes
to the cleaners later

384
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,400
Alright,
just don't complain later

385
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,040
l took him to the pub
last night. I almost lost him,

386
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,800
but thank God I got help.
You know, that guy that...

387
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,560
Alright, I'll tell you
some other time

388
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,560
You be quiet,
I'll talk to her

389
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,400
Comb your brother's hair,
it's sticking up

390
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,880
lt took me an hour
to get it like this

391
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,960
Don't yell,
you'll wake him up

392
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,240
She doesn't understand,

393
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,960
she's an old lady

394
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,360
He doesn't care about the old man.
He wants to do you!

395
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,760
Come on, he hasn't even
thought about that

396
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,800
Don't you think
l'd have noticed?

397
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,320
He spied on you
just like you spied on him!

398
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,560
I didn't spy on him!

399
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,480
You've been acting out a soap opera
for months

400
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,400
- For this afternoon, please
- This will take three days

401
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,480
Please, it's really urgent

402
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,480
It's Saturday, we're closed
this afternoon. No way, sweetie

403
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,600
It's a human issue

404
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,760
lf someone begs you
there must be a reason!

405
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,840
Come on,
it's important to her

406
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,240
Pass by later and knock
on the grate

407
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,040
Just this once, got that?
Nice suit, very fine fabric...

408
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,120
-Whose is it?
-What's it to you?

409
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,560
He's hitting on you, he even
knows how you like your coffee

410
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,920
These were in the pocket

411
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,960
-What's he doing with rocks?
- He throws them at busybodies!

412
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,040
Oh, hello!

413
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,000
Right now?

414
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,920
l don't know,
how can l do that?

415
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,080
Yes, that's a good idea

416
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,360
Where?

417
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,480
Alright, the same coffee bar.
Fine

418
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,600
The same coffee bar!

419
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,280
Do you two
have ''your song'' yet?

420
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,560
- Good morning
- Good morning

421
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,000
- Sit down
- Thank you

422
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,240
Would you like something?

423
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,000
-A coffee?
-Yes, a coffee, thank you

424
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,920
Two, please

425
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,600
- How is Simone?
- He was asleep when I left

426
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,520
l had to wash him last night.
I saw numbers on his arm...

427
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,760
- From a concentration camp?
-Yes

428
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,400
He took us here
to the Jewish neighborhood

429
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,040
I wanted to tell you, I called
a policewoman friend of mine

430
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,320
She said there's been no report
of anyone finding an old man

431
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,000
- They know nothing about this
- That's what I thought

432
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,960
She'll let me know if anyone
reports a missing person

433
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,040
- I see you're getting involved
-Yes, a bit

434
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,560
Thank you

435
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,160
- Milk?
-Yes, a drop

436
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,080
No, l don't take sugar

437
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,440
- l can'tstay here long
-Alright, we'll hurry

438
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,720
How is it that someone like you
took a stranger home?

439
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,440
lt wasn't me. It was
my soft hearted husband

440
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,960
He goes overboard when it comes
to helping someone

441
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,320
In fact, it seemed odd.
With your kids in the house...

442
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
What do the kids
have to do with this?

443
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,680
No, I only meant that...
it seemed rather strange

444
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,760
What did you think strange?
What do you know about me?

445
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,080
It's true, I hardly know
anything about you

446
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,360
I only know

447
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,960
that you take your children
to school at 8 every morning

448
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,560
Your friend, who has black
children, is always with you

449
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,960
I know that every night
after you wash the dishes

450
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,840
you stay in the kitchen
to smoke a cigarette

451
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,520
You put out your cigarette
under the tap water

452
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,080
I know you often wander
around the house at night

453
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,960
You go to the window
and look outside

454
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,920
But I don't know what you see

455
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,080
- Good morning
- Good morning

456
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,680
- l'd like some information
-Certainly, what is it?

457
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,040
Would you happen to know

458
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,800
an elderly gentleman
called Simone?

459
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,080
No, no one comes to mind

460
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,600
He's lost, he remembers nothing.
He's staying with her for now

461
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,640
I think he's
a concentration camp survivor

462
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,440
How can you say that?

463
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,960
He has those numbers
on his arm

464
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,120
He stopped here in front
of your shop last night

465
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,160
He knocked on the grating

466
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,760
as ifhe knew this place
very well

467
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,880
He may be one of your customers

468
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,040
Are you sure his name
is Simone?

469
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,040
lt's the only thing
he remembers

470
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,880
- Did you make a police report?
-Yes, but there's no response

471
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,360
Listen, I've worked here
for a very long time

472
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,000
Maybe if you brought him here
l'd recognize him

473
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,960
l'm sorry. We're not looking
forany missing persons here

474
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,320
It seemed the name Simone meant
something to you a minute ago

475
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,760
lt struck me because this
lady's brother was named Simone

476
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,080
But it can't be him.
Simone died many years ago

477
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,760
in a concentration camp

478
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,080
Excuse me,
where is your car parked?

479
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,880
-Along the river
- Mine is the other way

480
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,640
Goodbye

481
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,840
-Why was your cellphone off?.
- It wasn't, I was at the bar

482
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,040
Maybe it didn't receive there

483
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,840
Look, it's on.
I never turned it off

484
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,960
lf you say so

485
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,000
Didn't Simone go out with you
this morning?

486
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,520
Oh sure,
l took him shopping with me

487
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,440
- He wasn't here when I woke up
-Where is he now?

488
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,960
-You said you'd stay with him
-What did I say?

489
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,960
I said I was going to the
cleaners, you stupid shit!

490
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,160
-You're really a ball buster!
- l can never trust you!

491
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,360
I know you didn't make a police
report! I'm sick of this!

492
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,160
- It makes me even sicker!
- Then do something!

493
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,720
Take some initiative!
Just one thing!

494
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,080
What am I saying? You can't
even get on the day shift!

495
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,720
Give me time for fuck's sake!
It's a new job!

496
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,920
Do you call checking the gas
on trucks a job? Fuck you!

497
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,240
Is it my fault? You forget
l lost the job the auto shop

498
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,160
to a family member.
If it wasn't for the kids

499
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,320
l wouldn't be breathing
gas fumes all night!

500
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,440
You could stop breathing
for what they pay you!

501
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,600
Are you throwing money
in my face now?

502
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,000
I've always had a job!
Who gave you this house, huh?

503
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,520
If I'm correct, if your mother
hadn't passed you the lease...

504
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,040
At least I had parents
who helped us!

505
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,120
True, I didn't have any

506
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,320
But l'm not like you

507
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,040
At least I'm not like you!

508
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,280
Why? What am l?

509
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,120
Go on, say it!
What am l to you?

510
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,720
I'm a failure?
Am I a failure?

511
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,080
Right?!
You're a real bitch!

512
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,040
My dear Simone,

513
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,480
After you,
red is no longer red

514
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,120
The blue of the sky
is no longer blue

515
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,840
The trees are no longer green

516
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,960
After you,

517
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,760
l have to search for colors
in the yearning I have for us

518
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,280
After you,
l miss even the pain

519
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,200
that made our love
timid and secret

520
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,040
I regret the waiting,
the relinquishing,

521
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,960
the coded messages,

522
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,680
our stolen glances
in a world full of blind people

523
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,720
who didn't want to see

524
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,280
because if they'd seen us
we'd have been their shame,

525
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,640
their hatred, their cruelty

526
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,800
l regret I haven't yet had the
courage to ask your forgiveness

527
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,840
And that is why l can no longer
even look inside your window

528
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,240
That is where I always saw you
when I didn't

529
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,040
even know your name and you
dreamed of a better world

530
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,000
Aworld where a tree was not
forbidden to be a tree,

531
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,360
or for blue
to become the sky

532
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,960
I don't know
if this is a better world...

533
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,400
now that no one
calls me Davide anymore,

534
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,000
now that everyone calls me
only Mr. Veroli

535
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,080
How can l say
this is a better world?

536
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,560
How can I say that
without you?

537
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,400
l have to leave
in a few days

538
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,440
l'm being transfered
to the lschia branch

539
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,240
It must be a beautiful island

540
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,920
Yes.
But not now

541
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,360
It's always like this

542
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,560
l'm never good
at guessing the right timing

543
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,000
A few days ago, I thought
this promotion would save me

544
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,080
lt's the last thing l want
right now

545
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,840
It seems l always get
what I want at the wrong time

546
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,640
Everything's fine as long as
l'm dreaming of something,

547
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,720
but then when I try
to make that become reality...

548
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,920
l don't know how to explain it,
sorry, I know, but...

549
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,600
It's just that I...

550
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,920
l'd stay sitting on this bench
forever,

551
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,080
even though l know
it would never be possible...

552
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,320
Just look at
how you're dressed

553
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,400
You have to be cleaner, more
polite, better than other kids

554
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,960
That's easy
if everybody else is like you!

555
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,160
Martina!
Say you're sorry right now!

556
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,600
You weaned this kid
on viper's milk!

557
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,200
Hello.
May l please speak to

558
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,320
Mr. Veroli?
Mr. Davide Veroli

559
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,400
-Who is this?
-You wouldn't know my name

560
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,920
You don't know me.
Tell him I'm Simone's friend

561
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,080
-Simone?
-Yes

562
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,280
Just a moment

563
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,720
Mr. Veroli

564
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,680
is sleeping now,
please call back later

565
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,480
You may also leave me
your telephone number

566
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,720
Hello. We spoke yesterday.
I have an appointment

567
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,800
-with Mr. Davide Veroli
- Come in

568
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,160
You're not bringing bad news,
are you?

569
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,400
Why bad news?

570
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,800
You never know. I expect
just about anything from life!

571
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,920
Davide shouldn't be seeing you

572
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,960
However, don't agitate him.
Diabetes! Heart! Depression!

573
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,640
His problems are worse than
other people's! Understand?

574
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,120
- l'm sorry
-You're telling me

575
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,960
Just the effort it takes
for me to give him a pill...

576
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,760
There's nothing worse

577
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,520
then someone who refuses
to take care of himself!

578
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,880
Stop putting on a show, Sara

579
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,760
Why don't you go
make us some coffee?

580
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,520
''What's your name,
what's your name''

581
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,960
Martina constantly asked me

582
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,440
The only name l had
fixed in my head

583
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,560
was Simone's

584
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,320
I read it, I'm sorry

585
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,960
I thought it would help me
to find you

586
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,800
In fact, you found me

587
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,120
Simone never read this letter

588
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,040
When you found me
that morning

589
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,680
l was on my way
to our meeting place

590
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,920
Simone and l had
a secret meeting place

591
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,200
We left our messages there

592
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,400
Everything we couldn't say
in front of anyone else

593
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,440
or on the telephone,
we wrote

594
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,360
We hid the messages

595
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,000
between the stones
of the fountain

596
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,920
l made you worry,
didn't I?

597
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,840
Yes

598
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,280
Why?

599
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,480
Everything is ready

600
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,480
l don't taste things
as I once did

601
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,800
Come here.
Taste this chocolate

602
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,040
Did it break immediately?

603
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,080
l didn't notice,
it's melting

604
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,080
Quickly?

605
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,640
-Yes
- It's the grain

606
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,080
It must have an almost
imperceptible graininess

607
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,280
Then once it's melted
it must leave a sweet sensation

608
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,120
that lasts for just a moment,

609
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,040
and then the thing that counts
is the bitterness

610
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,200
Yes, that's what it tastes like

611
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,360
Do you taste the perfume
ofthe vanilla?

612
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,840
Yes, but...distantly

613
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,480
Distantly...

614
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,760
Yes, distance

615
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,480
You've transformed your passion
into a hobby

616
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,040
You shouldn't treat
your talent that way!

617
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,080
Do you know the pastry shop
on Via Giustini?

618
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,960
-Veroli's?
- Davide Veroli. It was his

619
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:31,360
He was a great pastry chef, an
artist famous all over Europe

620
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,360
- Have you known him long?
-A lifetime

621
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,800
l owe him my life

622
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,720
He was the one who saved me
on October 16, 1943

623
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,400
You don't know what
l'm talking about, do you?

624
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,000
No, I'm sorry

625
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,440
The Nazis...began at dawn
and continued all day

626
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,760
to load entire families on to
their trucks

627
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,720
Men, women,

628
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,800
old people, babies

629
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,720
Not only in the Ghetto,
but in all of Rome

630
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,800
Davide did everything to warn
as many people as he could

631
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,440
He saved a lot of children
thatday

632
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,880
That's why he was given
medals and honors...

633
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,200
For what it was worth...

634
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,240
-What did you do for him?
-Why?

635
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,160
You don't know how truly
privileged you are

636
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,160
He's never allowed anyone
to make pastry with him,

637
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,640
much less give them
his baking tools

638
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,840
Are you a pastry cheftoo?

639
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,040
l don't know, maybe it was...
all the love in the letter

640
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,400
that never made me think...
they were two men

641
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,680
I didn't realize it either,
but then...

642
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,320
Only after
l thought about it again...

643
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,480
Mama

644
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,080
- I'm on the telephone
- lt's been an hour!

645
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,840
The second time he has to go
home, why isn't Tom Thumb

646
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,840
-able to find the bread crumbs?
-I don't remember

647
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,880
-The birds ate them
- The birds, the birds ate them

648
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,200
But wasn't it pebbles he left
along the road?

649
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,080
Everyone remembers fairy tales
in their own way

650
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,000
Do you still have
a lot of packing to do?

651
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,800
l guess so

652
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,200
He's a dead end

653
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,880
Look, he wants to sleep with
you and then he'll take off

654
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,920
Anyway, he'll be in lschia
and you'll be here

655
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,360
Alright, but would he spy on me
for months just for a fuck?

656
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,720
Then tell him you're leaving
everything to run off with him

657
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,200
to live your dreams of love

658
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,200
on the island.
Watch how fast he disappears

659
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,640
Listen, l'm working overtime.
Will you wait for me?

660
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,840
No, I'll take the bus

661
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,000
Fuck him!

662
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,000
Yes, have yourself a good fuck

663
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,880
It's the only way

664
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,520
to get him out of your head.
Go home, make yourself pretty,

665
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,960
leave the kids
to sleep at my house,

666
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,240
and that's the end of it

667
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,080
Don't make that face,
it's not a tragedy

668
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,320
Look, if you do it well,
do it very well

669
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,720
Come in

670
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,320
I tried to give the place
some atmosphere

671
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,120
Maybe I went overboard

672
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,800
I'll put them out if you like

673
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,000
No, it's very nice

674
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,840
lf you knew for how long
I imagined this...

675
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,280
And now you're here

676
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,080
and I can kiss you.
I can kiss your mouth,

677
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,040
your face,

678
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,680
your eyes

679
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,320
You never stop,
did you know that?

680
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,960
You're always moving

681
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,840
Day after day
l watched you,

682
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,960
you became an obsession
for me

683
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,120
l came home early
just to watch you

684
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,600
I hid behind the curtains

685
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,200
l waited for you to go out
to see where you went

686
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,960
lt was enough to know
thatyou were there

687
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:39,040
and there were times l couldn't
tear myself from the window

688
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,400
in the hope that I'd see you
for one more instant

689
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,960
From that window?

690
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,640
Yes

691
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,880
With this transfer you'lI have
a lot of responsibilities

692
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,920
Your life will change
completely

693
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,520
A new place, a new job,
new friends

694
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,520
-It'll be hard at first, but...
-l'm not asking you to come

695
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,560
I can give you
all the time you want

696
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,880
Why do we have give this up?

697
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,440
I know it's difficult for you

698
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,880
lt's difficult for you
to be with me

699
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,960
But it's even more difficult
for me to leave you

700
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,960
l owe you 13 euros

701
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,720
I'll give it to you
at the end of the month

702
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,560
Hello.
l've brought back his suit

703
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,400
Giovanna, come in, please.
Hurry!

704
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,280
But I came only
to give him his suit

705
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,960
- No, please come inside
- Has something happened?

706
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,600
The air is too humid.
It's no good for pastries

707
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,640
lt makes it harder to knead
the dough

708
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,040
You didn't tell me
if the children liked

709
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,840
the cake we made together

710
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,120
I'm sorry, they liked it very much.
Emine went crazy for it too

711
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:50,640
That woman should go crazy
with a good diet

712
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,360
Today is not the day
to make pastries,

713
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,320
they're turning out badly

714
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,000
Are you sure he told you
the truth?

715
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:52,480
lt wasn't easy, he didn't want
to talk. But when I aimed

716
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,120
the gun at the baby,
he told me everything

717
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,760
He made a list of everyone
still hiding valuables

718
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:04,040
You can't go wrong. l'm not
leaving. Is everything ready?

719
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:08,800
Yes, the German troops are here.
In half an hour we'll surround

720
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,720
the Ghetto. What about that Jew
who works with you?

721
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,600
-Will he warn anyone?
-Who? That queer?

722
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,840
No, he's harmless.
I keep an eye on him

723
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,040
lfhe dares to leave here...

724
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,880
I believe you! I'm going,
but keep an eye on him

725
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,080
l saved many people that night

726
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,000
The same people
who laughed at me,

727
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,480
who didn't believe
in my sentiments,

728
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:54,040
who wouldn't accept
that l could love Simone

729
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,320
And to save them,
I lost him

730
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,600
I was at a crossroads,
can you understand that?

731
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,760
But instead of running
to Simone,

732
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,360
l chose
to warn the others first

733
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:19,040
l had to show
that l was worthy of them,

734
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,240
to save them first
would be my redemption

735
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,760
Where did you leave
the children?

736
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,160
With Emine

737
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,960
You mustn't trust anyone!

738
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,520
Every neighbor
could be an informer, a spy!

739
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:53,080
-They're not in danger
-Yes, they are! Run,

740
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,520
go home, hide them, take them
as far away as you can!

741
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,880
Calm down, Davide,
nothing's happened!

742
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:02,400
There's no time to lose,
they'll be here any minute!

743
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,760
- The children are safe
-Oh, the indifference...

744
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:10,280
That's your disease.
You're blind and deaf

745
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,760
They've stupified all of you
with their propaganda!

746
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,200
You must...

747
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,440
You must run and warn
everyone you know, Giovanna

748
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,720
Before it's too late!

749
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:27,280
Alright, Davide, l will.
Just calm down now

750
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,280
We're here with you,
nothing can happen

751
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,680
l'm not afraid for myself

752
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,040
I can't do anything now

753
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,760
But you...
you still have a choice

754
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:56,240
You can change, Giovanna

755
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,600
Don't be content
to merely survive

756
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,560
You must demand

757
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,480
to live in a better world,
not just dream about it

758
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,640
l didn't do that

759
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,280
Are you awake already?

760
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,080
I never went to sleep

761
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,560
Has something happened?

762
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,040
I've decided to quit my job

763
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,600
In two hours
I'll take the kids to school

764
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,000
and then I'll go to work
and give them my resignation

765
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,920
Why?
What's the reason?

766
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,600
l'm sorry

767
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,840
l thought something happened
to you at work

768
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,920
That you were forced to do this

769
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,760
No.
This was my choice

770
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,480
l should have done it sooner,
but I don't think it's too late

771
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,080
What will we do now?
What will you do?

772
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,240
I want to work
in a pastry shop

773
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,720
Help me, Filippo

774
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,040
Help me

775
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,360
- Here they are
-Where's my other bag?

776
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,640
I'll go get it

777
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,040
- That's very well done
- I know

778
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,840
Then why did you want me
to check it?

779
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,840
To show you how smart I am!

780
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,520
l've never had a doubt

781
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,920
lt's me!

782
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,920
Hi.
Did you find a job?

783
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,760
No, l had some interviews,
but l'm too old to apprentice

784
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,920
Did you make these for the pub?

785
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:15,560
- No, they're for us
- They're not fattening, right?

786
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,640
- No
- lf you get any fatter...

787
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,760
You little...

788
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,000
He's downstairs,

789
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,960
he's moving out

790
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,040
Should l put raisins
or almonds in the cookies?

791
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:50,080
Both

792
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,960
-We're done
- Good.You lock up

793
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,640
My dear Davide,

794
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:19,920
Since you left us forever,
Martina asks me of you often

795
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:25,040
She still calls you Simone.
I'll tell her your story soon

796
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,120
Yesterday at work,
for the first time l was asked

797
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,760
to make a cake by myself.
Guess which one l made?

798
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,840
The head pastry chef didn't
comment, but it was added

799
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,240
to the list of cakes to be made
for Sundays

800
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,600
l think that's a good sign

801
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,200
Filippo was able to get on
the day shift

802
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,920
lt seemed as if he'd won
the lottery, he was so happy

803
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,800
and I understood that l can't
ask more of him right now

804
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,680
You know, when l think
of Lorenzo,

805
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,360
l'm afraid l'm already
beginning to forget his face,

806
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,640
that I can't remember
his voice anymore

807
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,840
What is he doing right now?
Who is he smiling at?

808
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,920
l still need your advice,
Davide,

809
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,920
one of your glances,
one of your gestures

810
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,440
But then suddenly I'll feel
your gestures in mine,

811
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,920
and I recognize you
when I speak

812
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,680
Does everyone who leaves you

813
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,760
always leave part
of themselves with you?

814
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,360
ls this the secret
of having memories?

815
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,080
If that's true,
I feel much safer

816
01:37:43,305 --> 01:38:43,914

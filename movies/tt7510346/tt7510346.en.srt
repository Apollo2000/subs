1
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,355
Okay. Okay. Okay.

2
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,636
Oh, come on. Come on.

3
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,556
Open. Oh, God. No.
Shit! Shit! Oh, God!

4
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,510
<i>A memorial service
for Kurt Cobain</i>

5
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,920
<i>was held today in Seattle,</i>

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,356
<i>two days after the musician
was found dead</i>

7
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,760
<i>of an apparent suicide.</i>

8
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,150
That's not how
fancy nannies dress.

9
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,515
Come on. I'll take them.

10
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,589
I'm a private tutor.

11
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Okay.

12
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,470
Least you could do.
Leaving me without a roommate.

13
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,553
I'm sorry for the short notice.
They need me tomorrow.

14
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,314
What about your class?
I thought you love those kids.

15
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
I do.

16
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,110
But the school's the one
that put me up for it.

17
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,314
Look, I couldn't say no, okay?

18
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,071
A few years ago,
this little girl lost her parents,

19
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,755
and then now,
her nanny just abandoned her.

20
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,275
So you're ditching me
for a seven-year-old.

21
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,797
You don't know what it's like
to grow up without parents.

22
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Okay.

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,070
And I love teaching.

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,310
But...

25
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,039
I wanna make a difference, you know?

26
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,997
So, you taking those with you?

27
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
No.

28
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,719
I think I'm kind of looking forward
to having a little break from these.

29
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,118
She's been having a bad spell lately.

30
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,079
But I'm gonna go see her
tomorrow and say goodbye.

31
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,830
Here.

32
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,776
Are you gonna be okay
when you're up there?

33
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
My God.

34
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,793
I'm going from 25 screaming kids
to one little girl.

35
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,753
How hard can it be?

36
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,309
Hi, Mom.

37
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,916
What are you working on?

38
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,400
Hey, what if I help you move
your stuff back into the art room?

39
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,556
So...

40
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,716
I'm leaving today.

41
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,349
For the new job.

42
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,136
You remember I told you
about that little girl

43
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,117
all alone with her housekeeper?

44
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,596
Little girl? All on her own?

45
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,480
Yeah.

46
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,517
Well, that's a big responsibility.

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,516
I know.

48
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,196
I can handle it.

49
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,352
You look... nice.

50
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,156
Thank you.

51
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,358
Here. Take this.
It'll keep you warm.

52
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Okay.

53
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Love you.

54
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,114
This can't be real.

55
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,517
Flora leaves
her toys everywhere.

56
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,072
Don't be surprised if you find
a Little Mermaid in your toilet.

57
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,630
You must be Kate.

58
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,594
Yes. Hi.

59
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,036
Come along.

60
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,800
Are you Mrs. Grose?

61
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,916
I am.

62
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,071
It's so nice to meet you.

63
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,076
Wow.

64
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,512
And it's just
the two of you here?

65
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,479
Cleaners and the gardener
come in every couple of weeks.

66
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,678
But, yes, it's just me and Flora
while Miles is away at school.

67
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,674
And this is where
you'll give Flora her lessons.

68
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,592
Have you ever been
a live-in governess?

69
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,593
No. No, not since the 1800s.

70
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Is that a joke?

71
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,391
No, no. Not a funny one.

72
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,395
This is my first live-in job.

73
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,914
Ah.

74
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,992
Well, I hope you know
what you're doing.

75
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,150
The children are very special, Kate.

76
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
They're thoroughbreds.

77
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,112
Now, come along.
I have something on the stove.

78
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's so quiet.

79
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,549
All the better to hear you
when you get lost.

80
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,915
Is that a joke?

81
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,275
No.

82
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,991
Mmm. That smells so good.

83
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,356
I made this soup for Flora's father
when he was her age.

84
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,671
You've been with the family
for that long?

85
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,955
That's quite a commitment.

86
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,431
It's an honor... is what it is.

87
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,559
And may I ask how the parents died?

88
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,671
They died in a tragic car accident,
just outside the gate.

89
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,920
Flora saw the whole thing.

90
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,555
- That's awful.
- Yes, it is.

91
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,032
And it's hard for the children.

92
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,639
Well, growing up without parents is...

93
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,874
My father left
when I was Flora's age so...

94
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,475
Is that right?

95
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,114
Hmm.

96
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,799
I'd love to meet Flora.
Where might I find her?

97
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,839
She's down at the stables.

98
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,718
Just take the path
around the back.

99
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,236
Ah.

100
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,710
Uh, may I?

101
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Of course.

102
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
Flora?

103
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,710
Flora?

104
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,351
It's Kate. I came to say hi.

105
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Flora?

106
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,309
Flora.

107
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,675
Hi.

108
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,273
- Hi.
- Where were you hiding?

109
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,919
Like I'd tell.

110
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,358
Jeez. He's not very friendly, is he?

111
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,793
His name's Samson.
He's grumpy all the time.

112
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,792
He only lets Miles ride him.

113
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,992
Oh. And who's this?

114
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,400
This is Delilah.

115
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,318
She was my mother's horse.

116
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,837
You can pet her on the nose if you want.
Just be gentle, okay?

117
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,433
She wants your apple.

118
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,876
How did you know that?

119
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,598
She is my favorite horse.

120
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,036
Did you know that apples
have cyanide in them?

121
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,873
And the seeds are poisonous.

122
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,632
No, I did not know that.

123
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,676
How did you know that?

124
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,830
She told me.

125
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,757
Doctor Felicity Peppercorn
Clock Watch.

126
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,550
Nice to meet you, Felicity.
That's quite a name.

127
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,120
She's a veterinarian.

128
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,600
Is that what you wanna be?

129
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,036
- Or maybe a chef.
- You could be both.

130
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,271
I would have to be a vegetarian.

131
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,635
Why is that?

132
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,916
I can't save animals and eat them.

133
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,876
Very true.

134
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,917
Come on.

135
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,870
Hold on.

136
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,474
Wow.

137
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,711
This maze
is very complicated.

138
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,274
Yeah. It's so big.

139
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,152
You need to know
your way around, or you'll get lost.

140
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,872
One time I couldn't find my way out,

141
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,872
and I almost starved to death.

142
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
What?

143
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,430
Jeez, your friends must love it here.

144
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,599
I don't have any friends.

145
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,840
You have no friends?

146
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,036
Nope.

147
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,355
Well, you might have one now.

148
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,079
Maybe.

149
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,278
"Maybe." Okay, I'll work for it.

150
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,874
Okay. So, what,
you're in ninth grade, tenth?

151
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,189
- Second.
- Second? Wow.

152
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,999
I could've skipped a grade
if I wanted.

153
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,154
Miss Jessel said
I was an exceptional student.

154
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,879
Wait. Who's Miss Jessel?

155
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,190
My teacher before you.
She taught me French, you know.

156
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,316
She did?

157
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,517
Come on, slowpoke.

158
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,030
- And this mirror is from the 1980s.
- Ooh.

159
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,755
That's my great-great-
great-great-aunt Louisiana

160
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,399
and her dog, Otis.

161
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,517
And that's the ship
her brother died on.

162
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,750
Guess what he had?

163
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,830
He had dentistry.

164
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,950
Dysentery?

165
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,150
Yeah, that's what I said.

166
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,275
That's Miles' room.
And that's mine next to it.

167
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,480
Wait, wait. What's down there?

168
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,400
That's the east wing.

169
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,314
I don't go in that part of the house.

170
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Why not?

171
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Don't wanna.

172
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,759
This is your room.
I hope you like the bedding.

173
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,632
- This is my room?
- Yep.

174
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,910
Wow.

175
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,035
This is all for me?

176
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,440
Yep.

177
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,160
Oh. This is my
great-grandmother Sophie.

178
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,075
You stuffed your grandma?

179
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,676
No, silly head.
It's just supposed to look like her.

180
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,676
Oh, I see. Well, she's creepy, huh?

181
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,433
I think she's pretty.

182
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,318
Do you wanna see something else?

183
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,754
Yeah.

184
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,399
Behold. My great-grandmother's
sewing room.

185
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,798
My mother used to take me shopping
when I was little.

186
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,912
But after she died,

187
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,993
Miss Jessel started making
all of my clothes for me.

188
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,834
Well, that one's beautiful.

189
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,118
Miss Jessel never got to finish this one
before she left.

190
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,271
It was for my birthday.

191
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,117
I am a mannequin.

192
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,873
Mmm.

193
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,440
What is this?

194
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,391
Um... Yeah. Miles did that.

195
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,153
I told him it was tacky.

196
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Yikes.

197
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,998
Now eat it all up.

198
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,030
I have an idea.

199
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,270
What if you and I took
a little field trip

200
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,831
to go get some ice cream
before class started tomorrow?

201
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,515
Uh, no.
Flora doesn't leave the property.

202
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,359
She has everything
she needs here.

203
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
What?

204
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Don't you, darling?

205
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,114
She prefers my French apple tart

206
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,032
with a little bit of cream
on the side.

207
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,079
And you don't have to go anywhere
for that. Do you, darling?

208
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,072
No.

209
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,312
You're gonna leave me,
aren't you?

210
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,435
What are you talking about?

211
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,916
Miss Jessel left
without saying goodbye.

212
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,436
And now she won't talk to me anymore.

213
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,120
You know, some people
have a really hard time saying goodbye.

214
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,509
But I bet she did it the way she thought
would be best for both of you.

215
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,557
Well, it's not easy for me.

216
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,150
Let's get you to bed.

217
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,475
Okay.

218
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,236
Tucked in?

219
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,116
I like you.

220
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
I like you.

221
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,074
And I'm not going anywhere.

222
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,629
Promise, promise?

223
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,791
Cross my heart and hope to die.

224
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,519
Stick a needle in your eye?

225
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,752
Mmm. No. No, no.
Maybe not that part.

226
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,600
Okay.

227
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,473
Oh, God.

228
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,352
You are terrifying.

229
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,874
So weird.

230
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
God.

231
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,472
<i>Shh. Stop.</i>

232
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,960
- <i>Come here.
- Peter.</i>

233
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,913
<i>What are you doing
in here? How did you get here?</i>

234
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,960
<i>I said you need to leave, now.</i>

235
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,355
<i>Shh, shh. You're gonna
wake the children.</i>

236
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,920
<i>The children are asleep.</i>

237
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,635
<i>Don't touch me.</i>

238
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,816
<i>No one needs to know.</i>

239
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,998
<i>Please, stop.</i>

240
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,037
<i>Keep your eyes closed.</i>

241
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,519
<i>Just come dance with me.</i>

242
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,840
<i>Stop. I'm scared.</i>

243
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,838
<i>Help! You're scaring me!</i>

244
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,594
<i>You're hurting me!</i>

245
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,831
<i>You better go.</i>

246
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,877
<i>Look into my eyes, Jess.</i>

247
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,317
<i>Stop it! Please go.</i>

248
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,676
<i>- Leave me alone.
- I'm not going anywhere.</i>

249
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,195
<i>You're hurting me!
Don't touch me!</i>

250
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,075
Who are you?

251
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,599
I'm Miles. I live here.

252
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,233
I mean, um...
what are you doing home?

253
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,070
You shouldn't be in here.

254
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,631
I know.
I thought I heard something.

255
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You should go to bed.

256
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,998
<i>Monday, March 6th.</i>

257
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,800
<i>Flora got 100%
on her state capitals quiz.</i>

258
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,553
<i>I am so proud of her.</i>

259
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,711
<i>- French library terms.
- Reading in French today.</i>

260
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,029
Elle excelle.

261
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,839
<i>She also drew me
a picture of kangaroos</i>

262
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,376
<i>and elephants hopping
through the jungle.</i>

263
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,754
<i>Reading, free reading,
and art.</i>

264
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,536
<i>Flora only wanted
to paint in black and white.</i>

265
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,473
<i>Mathematics.
Six times table quiz.</i>

266
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,190
<i>Miles disappeared today.
I thought he had run off.</i>

267
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,920
<i>But it turns out
that creep took him to a bar.</i>

268
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,838
<i>They came home late,
laughing like they were both drunk.</i>

269
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,196
<i>♪ Ask me no more questions ♪</i>

277
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,510
Kate, come meet Miles.

278
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,270
We met.

279
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,192
I'm really sorry about last night.

280
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,715
I didn't mean to be rude or anything.

281
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,075
Sorry if I scared you.

282
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,231
Oh. It's fine.

283
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,754
Cool.

284
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,395
So, seems like you had
a rough night.

285
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,800
You're a sleepwalker, like Flora.

286
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,439
I don't sleepwalk.

287
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,035
How would you know, silly?
You're asleep the whole time.

288
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,839
I just know.

289
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,991
- That's a cool sweater.
- Thanks.

290
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,037
You shouldn't be wearing that.

291
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,270
He wanted me to have it.

292
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,795
- Was it your dad's?
- It was Quint's.

293
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,996
- Who is Quint?
- He was the riding instructor.

294
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,549
He managed the estate.
He was the best.

295
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,632
And he's not here anymore?

296
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,470
He died.

297
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Oh.

298
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,317
Everyone dies, Miles.

299
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,520
So, do you ride horses?

300
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,994
Oh. Well, I rode a couple of times
at summer camp.

301
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,256
Hello, Fairchild residence.

302
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,351
But that's a lie.
I just stayed on the horse.

303
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,396
- I can teach you if you want.
- Yeah?

304
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,278
I mean, if you can handle it.

305
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,478
- Oh, is that a challenge?
- Yeah.

306
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,836
- Uh, no, I think I can handle it.
- Please hold.

307
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,037
I'm a quick learner.

308
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,034
Hey.
It's the headmaster at Miles' school.

309
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,875
He would like to speak
with the person in charge.

310
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,390
Yes, fine.

311
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Better take that.

312
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,920
Hello. This is Kate.

313
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,436
So, Miss Flora,
are you forgetting your breakfast?

314
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,991
Yes? Well, let me
cut it up for you.

315
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,434
Okay. Thank you for letting us know.

316
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,753
So, what did old
fragile Farty want?

317
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,033
He, um...

318
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,830
He gave me a list
of some of your schoolwork

319
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,559
to complete while you're home.

320
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,916
Okay.

321
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,235
That sounds fun.

322
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,959
Great.

323
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,874
Where are you going?

324
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
To my room.

325
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,755
What about your plate?

326
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,320
- What?
- Your plate.

327
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,232
Aren't you gonna take it
to the kitchen?

328
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,278
Want me to cut the grass too?

329
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,680
No.

330
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,556
But Mrs. Grose prepared
a beautiful breakfast for us,

331
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,199
and it would be
the polite thing to do.

332
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,554
That's her job, right?

333
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Miles.

334
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,816
It's fine, Miles.

335
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,275
I'll do it, darling. You go on ahead.

336
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,436
Come on, Flora. Let's go.

337
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,000
It's not your job either, Flora.

338
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,836
They were born into privilege, Kate.

339
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,673
Can you please remember that?

340
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,914
Miles was expelled.

341
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,478
He attacked another student.

342
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,435
He what?

343
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,671
Yes, apparently a teacher found him

344
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,355
with his hands around
another boy's neck,

345
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,353
slamming his head
into the bathroom tile.

346
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,397
Oh, absolutely not.

347
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,477
No! He wouldn't do that.

348
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
He did.

349
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,200
And it sounds like he's very lucky

350
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,280
that the other boy's family
isn't pressing charges.

351
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,793
Yes, well, other boys, Kate,
have always been jealous of Miles.

352
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,157
- Here, let me help you.
- No, thank you.

353
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,795
This is my job.

354
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
You do yours.

355
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,989
And what's that lava
that sits in the volcano called?

356
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,675
Um... it's magma.

357
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,956
Mmm. Yeah. Ouch.

358
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,918
It is "ouch." Super hot.

359
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,475
- Flora?
- Yeah?

360
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,033
Does Miles get in trouble a lot?

361
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,195
Miles is the best.

362
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,280
Stop it!

363
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Thank you.

364
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,514
Flora, back to work.

365
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,910
Miles?

366
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,713
Don't you know how to knock?

367
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,073
Do you have a friend in here?

368
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,635
What do you want?

369
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,759
Sorry. I thought I saw
someone come in here.

370
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,269
There's no one in here.

371
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,633
It's just you and me.

372
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,080
Okay.

373
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,995
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

374
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,559
You're new.
I accept your apology.

375
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,474
It's interesting.

376
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,873
Yeah, she's just...
Well, there's two of them.

377
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,350
I thought it was just the little girl.

378
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
So did I.

379
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,035
But the brother is back
from boarding school.

380
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,871
And I think he hates me.

381
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,111
I knew it sounded
too good to be true.

382
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,360
Still happy you went?

383
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,070
Oh, yeah. Sorry, it's great.

384
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,719
So focus on the positives.

385
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,399
Don't let this kid
get under your skin.

386
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,838
Working on it.

387
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,479
Tell me about the house now.

388
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,315
Are there, like, creepy suits of armor
or paintings with eyes cut out?

389
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,713
<i>Or a crypt in the basement?</i>

390
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Yeah.

391
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,590
<i>Hello?</i>

392
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
<i>Kate?</i>

393
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,955
<i>You're not listening to me.</i>

394
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,520
No, I am listening.

395
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,795
Help!

396
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,514
<i>So, remember that guy Tanner?</i>

397
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,353
<i>We went to that bar on 14th
a few weeks ago?</i>

398
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,151
<i>Well, he finally called me back.
But now I'm in...</i>

399
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,718
Oh, my God. I gotta go.

400
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,989
We got you. We got you.
We got you. We got you.

401
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,998
Both of you in the house now!

402
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,960
What on earth
happened to you?

403
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,554
Ask the thoroughbreds.

404
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,394
What?

405
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,919
What are you doing?

406
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,195
There was a spider on you.

407
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,470
It was crawling up towards your face.

408
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,431
When my door is closed,
I'd like you to knock.

409
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,434
Your light was on.
Thought you'd be awake.

410
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,034
You scared of the dark?

411
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,189
I'm sorry.

412
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,791
I haven't made
the best impression, have I?

413
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,478
To be honest, you haven't.

414
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Miles.

415
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,313
What happened at school?

416
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,471
Why did you hurt that boy?

417
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,519
He burned every one of
the pictures my father sent me.

418
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,320
I miss him.

419
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,240
You need to go to bed.

420
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,311
Can I still give you
your riding lesson tomorrow?

421
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Sure.

422
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,316
Head up.
Thighs against the horse.

423
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,120
Sit in the center of the saddle.
You'll get better balance.

424
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,915
Ride harder.

425
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,496
Put your thumb on
the top of your reins

426
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,840
and your pinkie on the bottom.

427
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,115
Don't let her get the bit.

428
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,271
Okay. I'm not.

429
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,950
Rein her in hard.

430
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,195
Well done.

431
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,831
You didn't have to keep
whipping her.

432
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
Yes, I did.

433
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,071
You wanted to learn.
That's how Quint taught me.

434
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,434
It's a strong animal.

435
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,036
If you don't exert power over it,
then you'll never gain control.

436
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,550
You look good up there.

437
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,310
Miles. I'm bored.
Can we do something else now?

438
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,720
What do you wanna do?

439
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,837
Can we show Kate the koi pond?

440
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,196
It's Flora's favorite part of the garden.

441
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,396
Let's check it out.

442
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,118
Look. That koi is,
like, bumping into the wall.

443
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,560
Like...

444
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,195
Okay.

445
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,776
She's trying to
make her great escape.

446
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,200
Maybe she wants to be
a flying fish.

447
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,594
Make a wish
upon the rock.

448
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,159
I wish that this...

449
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,471
Longer. For 25 years.

450
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,156
What if he lived to be, like, 100?

451
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,513
This is so pretty.

452
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,790
Miles!

453
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,950
He's got a fish.

454
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,069
Stop!

455
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,440
Get the hell off of her!

456
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,239
Oh.

457
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,674
Poor baby.

458
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,270
Miles!

459
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,315
What are you doing?

460
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,560
Nothing should have to suffer.

461
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,592
That was my favorite fish.

462
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,992
Now you've seen the koi pond.

463
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,559
I love this tea party.
Me too.

464
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,551
Hey, don't drink out of my cup.

465
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,000
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't
give you any tea.

466
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,280
Oh, my...

467
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,796
Miles?

468
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,590
Flora.

469
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,991
Just checking you were still here.

470
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,800
Still here.

471
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,434
Miles' effects from his school
arrived this morning.

472
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,480
Wow.

473
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,836
- Mrs. Grose.
- What?

474
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,956
Do you ever hear...

475
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,917
I'm gonna get you!
You're it!

476
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,400
Guys. It's very early.

477
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,936
- Can you stop?
- You're it! You're it.

478
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,316
Children,
can you listen to Kate?

479
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,232
Listen to Kate, please.

480
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,640
You need to take charge here, Kate.

481
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,796
Bad dreams?

482
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,156
I have an idea.

483
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,072
Since it's Saturday,

484
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,039
why don't we go into Millbrook
and get a new koi?

485
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,156
Hmm?

486
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,796
Yeah.

487
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,235
I don't want to.

488
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,953
Come on. It'll be fun.

489
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,157
You know that Flora
doesn't leave the property.

490
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,639
You don't have to go, darling.

491
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,113
What if I asked my special friend?

492
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,760
Want me to try?

493
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,597
Will you keep me and Flora safe?

494
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,999
You will?

495
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,276
- And Kate too?
- And Kate too?

496
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,480
Really?

497
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,992
He says you have nothing
to worry about.

498
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,435
Okay. So, go get your coat.

499
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,353
Good job, Miles.

500
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,397
He also thinks your tattoo is sexy.

501
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,680
<i>♪ I get mean when I'm nervous
Like a bad dog ♪</i>

502
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,595
<i>♪ I get mean when I'm nervous

503
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,879
<i>♪ I want to jump into blue water ♪</i>

504
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,920

505
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,152

506
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,315
<i>♪ I was meant for running fast ♪</i>

507
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,676
Please stop. I don't wanna go.

508
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,520
Oh, no, honey. We're almost
at the gate. We'll be fine.

509
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,195
I don't wanna go! Stop!

510
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,640
- Hey. What are you doing?
- I wanna get out.

511
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,478
- Flora, stay in your seat.
- Stop the car.

512
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,080
No.
Leave your seat belt on.

513
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,640
Sit down, Flora.

514
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,111
Miles, tell her to stop
or I'm gonna die!

515
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,236
Stop the car.

516
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,238
Miles, I don't wanna die!

517
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,114
Stop the car or I'll fucking kill you!

518
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,830
I told you to stop.

519
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,877
Wait. Flora.

520
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,070
Oh, Jesus.

521
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,160
Come on.

522
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,514
I know what you're afraid of.

523
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,950
Keeping the lights on
won't keep you safe.

524
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,109
Flora?

525
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,671
- Flora?
- Leave her alone.

526
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,395
- Flora, can you look at me?
- She doesn't wanna talk to you.

527
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,437
You terrified her.

528
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,113
Where'd they find you anyways?

529
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,596
You need to stop talking
to me like that.

530
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,757
You're not our mother.
You're not our family.

531
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,869
Stop pretending to be.

532
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,120
I'm leaving.

533
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,193
Yeah. Just leave.
Leave like everyone else.

534
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,595
This is Rose's assistant.
How may I help you?

535
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,196
Hi, Rose.

536
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,639
Hey, hey. You okay?

537
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,518
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm great.

538
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,390
How are you?

539
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,439
It's so nice to hear your voice.

540
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,671
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

541
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,433
<i>Actually, it's, um...</i>

542
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,352
it's a little tough here.

543
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,310
The... The boy hates my guts
for some reason

544
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,598
and the little girl
isn't speaking to me, so...

545
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,353
I'd like to think
it's nothing that I'm doing, but...

546
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,520
maybe it is.

547
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,840
Or maybe they just don't want me.
I don't know.

548
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,556
I don't know.

549
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,352
It's really, um, hard here.

550
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,556
I think, uh...

551
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,680
I think maybe I can't stay.

552
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,638
Then don't. Bail.

553
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,315
They can find someone else
and I can have my roommate back.

554
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,360
No.

555
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,400
I can't. I made Flora a promise.

556
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,872
And I crossed my heart
and hoped to die.

557
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,716
Hi.

558
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,116
Can I sit?

559
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,110
That's better.

560
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,199
Hey, Flora.

561
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,040
I'm sorry that I didn't stop
when you first asked me.

562
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,831
It's really not nice
not to be listened to.

563
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,838
Have you ever heard
of a brave face?

564
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,474
Hmm?

565
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,600
I'm actually wearing mine right now.
Can you see it?

566
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,599
I don't see anything.

567
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,030
That's good.
Because it's invisible.

568
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,896
So if you saw something,
it would mean it was broken.

569
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,877
My mom showed me
how to make one,

570
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,216
so I can do it for you if you want.

571
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,677
I've actually been wearing mine
since I was way younger than you.

572
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,550
- Really?
- Yeah.

573
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,520
What do you think?
Should we try?

574
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,877
I just have to do
a quick scan of your face

575
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,189
to make it first, okay?

576
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,839
Blow.

577
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,559
Good, good, good.

578
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,477
- Oh, that's a good one.
- Yeah.

579
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,791
That's really... You've got
a good face for it. Yeah.

580
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,960
So, I'm gonna get all of
my bravery and all of yours

581
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,356
and mix it together
and get it into my fingertips.

582
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,516
Okay.

583
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,960
Looks good.

584
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,397
So, let's see.
Show me your brave face.

585
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,751
Flora. Come on.

586
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,357
You've got a wild animal inside you.
Let me see you roar.

587
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,276
Roar!

588
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,750
Ha!

589
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,877
That was a huge roar.

590
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,350
I've never seen a brave face
take so fast.

591
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,274
Should we test it out,
see if we can see ourselves in the water?

592
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,755
- Roar!
- Roar!

593
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,516
Hi.

594
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,796
Um, I-I got you something in town.

595
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,400
It's, um...

596
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,071
This.
It's just this great album.

597
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,276
Thanks.

598
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,071
So, I know how close you and Quint were.

599
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,874
Yeah. He was my friend.

600
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,960
Yeah.

601
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,471
That must've been really tough.

602
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,157
Do you want to talk about it?

603
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,480
Not really.

604
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,475
You know, something kind of similar
happened to me when I was your age

605
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,995
and I'd wished I had someone to talk to.

606
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,630
Okay.

607
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,037
Look, I'm not trying to replace Quint.

608
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,316
Can you stop...

609
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,360
Miles.

610
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,160
Can you please stop?

611
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,600
We need to talk.

612
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,160
Oh, you're back.

613
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,554
I thought we'd lost another one.

614
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,239
Is Miles the reason Miss Jessel left?

615
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,993
Miles?

616
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,355
Don't be ridiculous.

617
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,196
Then why?

618
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,796
It was Quint.

619
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,480
There was something
going on between them.

620
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,952
Could tell by the way he looked at her.

621
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,913
That's not a reason to run away.

622
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,196
Well, I gather things
went south with them.

623
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,280
Why?

624
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,874
Because he was a brute.

625
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,276
When the parents died,

626
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,477
he walked around this place
like he owned it.

627
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,631
Even moved himself into the master suite.

628
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,274
He was disgusting.

629
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,073
How did Quint die?

630
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,192
He had an accident.

631
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,317
A couple of weeks after Miss Jessel left.

632
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,595
Fell from his horse, drunk.

633
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,197
Died in the dirt
like the animal that he was.

634
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,119
How was he with Miles?

635
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,679
He was a terrible influence.

636
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,752
He used to take Miles
and disappear with him for hours.

637
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,317
And Miles was such a sweet boy.

638
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,836
The Miles I've met is not a sweet boy.

639
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,074
Well, that is really no concern
of yours, is it, Kate?

640
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,200
Then whose concern is it?

641
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,310
I mean, it certainly
doesn't seem to be any of yours.

642
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,992
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

643
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,416
<i>Quint sat
next to me at dinner,</i>

644
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,510
<i>reeking of whiskey.</i>

645
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,794
<i>He won't leave me alone.</i>

646
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,558
<i>Mrs. Grose won't do anything
to help.</i>

647
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,117
<i>I have to sleep
with my door locked.</i>

648
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,431
<i>Quint tried to come in,
in the middle of the night.</i>

649
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,951
<i>I can barely focus
on my lessons now.</i>

650
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,031
<i>I feel Quint's eyes on me
all the time.</i>

651
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,475
<i>I woke up to a photo
that Quint left on my bed.</i>

652
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,239
<i>I don't know how he got in.</i>

653
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,631
<i>I'm not safe.</i>

654
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,154
<i>I have to leave.</i>

655
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,715
Miles, come back.

656
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,840
Miles!

657
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,715
Talk to me!

658
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,319
Miles!

659
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,429
Wait!

660
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:46,920
<i>Stop!</i>

661
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,589
<i>You're hurting me.</i>

662
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:09,560
Help me. Help me.

663
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,918
Help me.

664
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,635
Flora!

665
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,234
Can you paint at your desk, please?

666
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,993
I paint better over here.

667
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,151
No, you're gonna get paint
all over the floor.

668
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,635
Okay, fine. I'm finished anyways.

669
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,440
Wanna see?

670
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,113
Sure.

671
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,434
What is this?

672
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,355
Me and Miss Jessel.

673
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,350
Can we play flashlight tag now?

674
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,155
No.

675
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,038
But you promised.

676
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,713
Yeah, Kate. You promised.

677
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,559
You don't wanna let Flora down, do you?

678
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,118
You promised. You promised.
You promised. You promised.

679
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,272
You promised. You promised.
You promised. You promised.

680
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,829
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

681
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,990
Just...

682
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,796
What are the rules?

683
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,395
Turn off all the lights.
You have to find us with this.

684
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,835
If you flash us, we're dead.

685
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,440
You're it.

686
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,638
Call out the state capitals.
No peeking.

687
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,360
Come on. Come on. Come on.

688
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,396
Alaska...

689
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,876
Juneau.

690
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,759
Arizona: Phoenix.

691
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,993
Gotcha.

692
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,835
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.

693
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,400
Is Miles down there?

694
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,075
Maybe.

695
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,719
You wanna come with me
to find him?

696
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,200
I can't. I'm dead.

697
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,560
Miles!

698
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,313
Okay, I don't wanna play anymore.

699
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,115
Miles?

700
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,920
Do you remember
any of the moves?

701
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,150
- No.
- No.

702
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,390
Did I even play...

703
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,634
Can you just...

704
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,915
just stop?

705
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,310
Stop it!

706
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,595
This isn't funny!

707
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:06,914
You...

708
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,240
You!

709
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,472
Kate. Oh, my God.
What happened to your face?

710
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,633
Explain yourself.

711
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,910
I was hungry.

712
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,754
I am sick of the games!

713
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,672
Don't talk to them like that.

714
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,992
He has been terrorizing me
since day one!

715
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,799
Don't be ridiculous.

716
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,195
He's been here with me
for the last 15 minutes.

717
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,830
The only person doing
the terrorizing around here is you.

718
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,395
Now what are you doing?

719
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,316
Bad dreams?

720
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,196
I'm gonna sleep with you, okay?

721
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,549
Come on.

722
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,040
This came for you.

723
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,433
Did you open my mail?

724
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,910
It came like that.

725
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,514
Who is Darla?

726
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,280
My mother.

727
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,514
Oh, I see.

728
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,311
Well, we can't choose our family.

729
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,957
Whatever your mother has,
let's hope it's not genetic.

730
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,160
Yeah?

731
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,790
Kate, I need you.

732
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,950
Mom?

733
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,593
I can't talk right now.

734
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,400
They're gonna throw me out.

735
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,550
<i>What?</i>

736
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:31,031
Mom, I think I'm seeing things.

737
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,480
<i>Did you look at the drawings?</i>

738
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,230
Yeah.

739
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,430
Darla.

740
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,590
<i>Mom?</i>

741
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,120
Mom!

742
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,720
Flora?

743
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,840
Flora?

744
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:15,870
Miles?

745
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,216
<i>You're gonna wake the children.</i>

746
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,720
<i>The children are asleep.</i>

747
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,560
<i>I said you need to leave now.</i>

748
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,515
<i>Let me go, let me go.</i>

749
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,795
<i>No, stop!</i>

750
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,157
<i>Stop! No. No.</i>

751
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,150
Oh, my God.

752
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,030
Kate.

753
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,240
Kate.

754
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,230
Kate.

755
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,793
It was him.

756
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:08,880
It was Quint.

757
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,155
What are you talking about?

758
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,157
Quint murdered Jessel.

759
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,033
I saw her body
in the bottom of the lake.

760
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,520
You stop now!

761
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,469
You stop telling tales.

762
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,710
You knew.

763
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,035
You knew Quint killed Jessel!

764
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,510
Look. Quint's dead.

765
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,920
I made sure of it.

766
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,190
Where are the kids?

767
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,430
You stay away from them.

768
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,000
They're not safe.

769
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,036
I should never have let you in here
in the first place.

770
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,873
You knew.

771
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,713
You knew.
You never did anything.

772
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,872
I've been protecting this family
for a lifetime.

773
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,679
And I won't let you near them.

774
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,638
'Cause you're mad, Kate.

775
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,870
Move!

776
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,515
Flora!

777
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,875
Flora.

778
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,480
Are you okay?

779
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,630
I'm scared.

780
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,110
Okay, do you still have that brave face?

781
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,917
I need you to put it on, okay?

782
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,390
It's good?

783
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,394
Okay, let's go.

784
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,754
Where are we going?

785
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,795
Everything's gonna be fine.

786
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,394
We just need to get to the car.

787
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,473
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna leave!

788
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,358
Flora, come back.

789
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,398
Miles? We have to go!
We have to get Flora out of here.

790
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,112
Hey, Miles. Listen.

791
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,480
It's Quint.

792
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,079
I thought I was going crazy, but I'm not.
He's here.

793
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,116
You know that, don't you?

794
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,997
Mrs. Grose is dead, isn't she?

795
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,440
Yeah.

796
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,000
We need to leave.

797
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,072
No, I can't.

798
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,120
I'm sorry. For everything.

799
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,032
Flora won't leave without you.

800
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,440
We need to go!

801
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,160
I can't.

802
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
He won't let me leave.

803
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,191
How long until he hurts Flora?

804
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,674
Please, Miles!

805
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:20,760
Miles!

806
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:24,916
Please.

807
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:37,720
Open the door!

808
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,030
Okay.

809
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,434
Okay.

810
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,520
Stay down.

811
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,034
I need you to be brave, okay?

812
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,680
Okay.

813
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,397
Come on. Come on, open.

814
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,714
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on.

815
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,710
Okay.

816
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,549
Whatever your mother has,
let's hope it's not genetic.

817
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,072
I guess you can't
escape the inevitable.

818
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,918
No, stop it.
I'm serious.

819
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,696
You shouldn't be
going into her room.

820
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,040
You have to trust me on this.

821
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,630
Shh. I can hear her.
Play it cool. She's coming.

822
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,877
Miles, what's wrong with her?

823
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,280
She looks scary.

824
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,273
What are you guys doing in here?

825
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:44,720
I wanna go.

826
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,030
What's wrong?

827
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,837
Shh. Flora.

828
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:01,634
Flora.

829
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,270
Flora.

830
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,153
Did you see Quint in the mirror?

831
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,435
I know that you saw him.

832
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,554
Yes, you did. I saw you.

833
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:12,680
Quint's dead.

834
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,354
You saw him too.

835
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:17,954
No, I didn't.

836
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,599
Why are you lying to me?

837
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,240
- I saw him. I know you saw him.
- I didn't see him!

838
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:23,595
Just tell me that you saw him!

839
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,680
Flora! Tell me you saw...

840
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,319
You broke her!

841
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,914
No.

842
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,071
She's broken. You broke her!

843
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,680
I can fix her.
Just let me...

844
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,558
No, you can't! You broke her!

845
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,856
- It was an accident.
- You broke her!

846
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,360
You can't fix it.

847
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:40,594
She's broken.

848
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:42,960
Just like you.

849
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:49,910
Come on, Flora.

850
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,113
Why is Kate crazy?

851
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:08,800
I don't know.

852
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,056
<i>Well, that's
a big responsibility.</i>

853
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,776
<i>Miss Jessel left
without saying goodbye.</i>

854
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,800
<i>It was Quint.</i>

855
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,016
<i>I know
what you're afraid of.</i>

856
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,536
<i>You need
to take charge here, Kate.</i>

857
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,016
<i>Just checking
you were still here.</i>

858
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,616
<i>You're not our mother.
You're not our family.</i>

859
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,676
<i>Stop pretending to be.</i>

860
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,136
<i>He's been terrorizing me
since day one.</i>

861
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,296
<i>The only person doing</i>

862
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,680
<i>the terrorizing
around here is you.</i>

3
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:38,438
Gabrielle?

4
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,974
Gabrielle, wake up.

5
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:45,813
No, let me sleep.

6
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:49,380
Come on, Gabrielle.

7
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:51,716
- What time is it?
- Seven o'clock.

8
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:53,321
Willy's coming today.

9
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,760
Well.

10
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:38,764
At least it was an entertainment.
It takes so long to get here.

11
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:40,998
And how is Paris
these days, Willy?

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,868
It's a hotbed.
It's electric.

13
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,038
It's heaving with artists
and poets and writers,

14
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,473
all seeking to say
something profound.

15
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:52,477
Most of them are too young,
of course, or too crazed,

16
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,846
but still, they generate
a certain life force.

17
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,115
We were going in to see
a play, weren't we?

18
00:02:57,117 --> 00:03:00,485
- Yes, <i>La Tosca.</i>
- Ah.

19
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:03,021
Yes. No, I...
I was at the opening.

20
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:04,890
I wouldn't bother,
to be frank.

21
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,626
I mean, Sarah Bernhardt does her best.
She always does.

22
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:09,027
But it's melodramatic
in extremis.

23
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:12,062
- Maybe I'll go, make up my own mind.
- Well, of course.

24
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:14,800
But do remember, if a book bores
you, you can throw it away.

25
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:17,735
If a painting is too garish,
then you can close your eyes.

26
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:20,171
But bad theater,
it's like dentistry.

27
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:23,775
You're compelled to stay in your
chair, having your skull drilled

28
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:26,144
until the entire
grisly procedure is over.

29
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:27,749
Good point, Willy.

30
00:03:28,548 --> 00:03:30,517
Painful business.

31
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:33,654
Oh, I almost forgot.

32
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:41,529
- A small gift.
- Thank you.

33
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:49,536
You turn it upside down.

34
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:56,476
Pretty.

35
00:03:57,076 --> 00:03:58,745
Good-bye.

36
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,650
Sido, I'm going
for a walk.

37
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:07,519
Change your dress first.

38
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:09,624
- I'll stay on the path.
- Change it.

39
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,459
Darling,
we're going to go in.

40
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:20,031
He's a good man.
He has a reputation, yes.

41
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,233
But there comes a time in a
man's life to settle down.

42
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:24,101
Have you finished the letter
to his father?

43
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:26,103
I keep starting.

44
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:28,507
But I can't seem
to finish it.

45
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:32,276
A girl without a dowry, that just
doesn't happen in their circles.

46
00:04:32,278 --> 00:04:35,579
Hmm. They call it off.
The world won't end.

47
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:38,783
Sido.
He clearly adores her.

48
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:40,985
He's visited
four times this year.

49
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:42,920
I'm worried that
he won't understand her.

50
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:45,122
- Would anyone be good enough for you?
- Can I go now?

51
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:47,792
Just take this with you and fill
it up with some blackberries.

52
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:49,761
I'm going to make a tart tomorrow.
Don't be late back!

53
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:50,763
I won't.

54
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:26,500
- Where are you?
- Over here.

55
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:36,675
Your hair
is a phenomenon.

56
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:39,577
In the village, they call me
"the girl with the hair."

57
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,112
I'm sure they do.

58
00:05:41,114 --> 00:05:44,118
I should think you're quite
famous here in your village.

59
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:48,052
How much time
do we have?

60
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:50,187
About 40 minutes.

61
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:52,660
But I have to
walk to the station.

62
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:04,336
Gabrielle, I can't tell you
how happy I am.

63
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:06,271
So am I.

64
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:08,109
I adore you.

65
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:13,678
<i>Dear Willy,</i>

66
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,882
<i>As I walked home by the river, the
light shining through the trees,</i>

67
00:06:17,884 --> 00:06:21,685
<i>my heart filled with
a kind of delicious pride.</i>

68
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:25,322
<i>After all, you know all
those fine women of Paris,</i>

69
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:27,594
<i>so I must have something.</i>

70
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:32,363
<i>I want to wake up next to you,</i>

71
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:35,266
<i>know that the day is ours,</i>

72
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:39,004
<i>that life is ours
for the taking.</i>

73
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:42,643
<i>We will be so entire
and so happy, my love.</i>

74
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:55,319
Breathe in, ma'am.

75
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:57,658
There we go.

76
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:07,999
Ready yet?

77
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,637
No, not yet.

78
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,708
What do you think,
Matilde?

79
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,742
It's pretty, ma'am.

80
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:21,648
We should try to get there
before it ends.

81
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:28,119
- Where's your new dress?
- Oh, I couldn't breathe in it. It felt ridiculous.

82
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:31,288
But that cost me 267 francs.
Don't you like it?

83
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,425
Well, I know you like it.

84
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:35,896
We'll get it adjusted.

85
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:54,714
- What is it?
- I think it's toothpaste.

86
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:57,218
Let's have a look.

87
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:01,319
There. Perfect.

88
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:03,023
Let's go in.

89
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:24,210
Willy.

90
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:28,312
It's monstrous.
I can't look at it.

91
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:30,415
Don't worry, my dear.
It's only temporary.

92
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:34,485
There's Willy. Willy, Eiffel's tower.
Are you for or against?

93
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:38,288
Oh, I'm for it, if a little
jealous of this giant erection

94
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,825
in the heart of our capital
belonging to somebody else.

95
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:42,226
How are you, Count?

96
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:44,962
- I'm well, thank you.
- Ah. You rogue, Willy.

97
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:47,499
I see you've brought us
an orphaned relative?

98
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:49,366
- Hmm.
- A secret love child.

99
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:50,634
Very good, very good.

100
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:54,304
No, may I introduce to you my
wife, Gabrielle Sidonie Colette.

101
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:56,073
- Pleased to meet you.
- Delighted.

102
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,275
Well, astonished,
actually.

103
00:08:58,277 --> 00:09:01,812
You, my dear, have caught
the slipperiest of eels.

104
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:03,081
Now, now, Arman.

105
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,518
- How does one do that?
- I'm not sure.

106
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,519
Where are you from,
you sweet thing?

107
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,790
Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye.

108
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:13,057
- It's in Burgundy.
- Ah.

109
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,926
Is that where
you got your dress?

110
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:18,562
- Have you relocated, Willy?
- Not yet, Count, not yet.

111
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,999
Ignore him. How on earth
did you two meet?

112
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,268
Our fathers served together
in the army.

113
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,937
Willy married!
The wild days are done, eh?

114
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:28,438
On the contrary, the wild
days have just begun.

115
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,241
Ah! Willy.
Thank God you're back.

116
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:34,312
- That short story.
- Veber, may I introduce to you my wife.

117
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:35,980
- What?
- Gabrielle.

118
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:38,383
Very pleased to meet you.

119
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:41,251
It's due on Tuesday, and you've not
given me the slightest clue...

120
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:43,888
Right. Just amuse yourself
for a moment, Gabrielle.

121
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,390
It's simple.
It's an 800-word sketch.

122
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:09,049
You poor thing.

123
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:14,255
You want the earth
and the grass, don't you?

124
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,164
That's
gardenia, isn't it?

125
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,235
Well, what is it? It's
calla lilies, isn't it?

126
00:11:15,681 --> 00:11:17,450
So, what did you
think of the salon?

127
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,351
I liked the tortoise.

128
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:25,523
I thought he was as bored as I was.

129
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:28,091
I suspect you were more
intimidated than bored.

130
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:29,961
No.

131
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:33,197
I thought they were all...
shallow and pretentious.

132
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:36,333
No. Come on.
You're reading them wrongly.

133
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:41,139
It's not so much pretension
as exaggeration.

134
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:45,009
The ideal is to be authentic
but larger than life.

135
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:48,145
To present a personality
with a capital "P."

136
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:51,615
You could do it too.
Country girl charm.

137
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:53,518
Did that woman
have a capital "P"?

138
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,057
- Which one?
- The one you were talking to in the red dress.

139
00:11:58,357 --> 00:12:01,024
Nicole D'Allier?

140
00:12:01,026 --> 00:12:03,427
Come on, that was...
that was just flirtation.

141
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,495
- It meant nothing.
- Well, then, why do it?

142
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:07,597
Because that's what one
does to pass the time,

143
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:10,100
stave off boredom.

144
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:12,602
Come on.
Forget about them.

145
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:15,306
Have you heard the news?

146
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:18,475
Willy is married.
Happily married.

147
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:22,982
And he's going home with his beautiful
bride, who he loves very much.

148
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:41,068
- Good morning, Monsieur Veber.
- Morning, Matilde.

149
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,369
- Hello, Veber.
- Gabrielle.

150
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:48,072
- It's cold out there today.
- I wouldn't know. I'm under house arrest.

151
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:49,606
Schwob's already in there.

152
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:50,942
Thank you.

153
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:55,712
All the humor and vivacity descends
into a dreadful operatic swamp.

154
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:58,448
It releases the very toxins
of man's soul,

155
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,085
leaving the audience
nauseous and pale,

156
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,519
like they've just eaten
a bad oyster.

157
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:06,157
That's a bit extreme. I actually thought
the ending was rather touching.

158
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,725
No middle ground. Don't soft-peddle it.
Just kill it.

159
00:13:08,727 --> 00:13:10,794
- Veber.
- Willy.

160
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:12,562
Schwob.

161
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:15,265
So add those embellishments and
file it with <i>The Echo</i> by 6:00.

162
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:17,067
Will do.

163
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:19,370
The factory's on fire.
We're on fire.

164
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:22,273
I have this remarkable idea.
Or at least I think it could be.

165
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,545
- All right, what is it?
- I'm going to launch a novel.

166
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:27,711
- A novel?
- Yeah, we have stories by Willy.

167
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:30,581
We have music reviews by Willy.
Now we have Willy's first novel.

168
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,682
It'll have enough literature
for the highbrows

169
00:13:32,684 --> 00:13:36,354
and enough filth for the great
unwashed, or vice versa.

170
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:38,359
And who's going to
write this novel?

171
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:42,262
You are.

172
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,833
Are you writing
for him too?

173
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,836
Mm-hmm.

174
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:54,772
He's made you one
of his ghosts already?

175
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:56,673
Just letters.

176
00:13:56,675 --> 00:14:00,177
You're fastidious.
Exacting.

177
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,812
A lot of crossing out,
you mean.

178
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:02,880
Well, yes.

179
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:06,417
Willy copies them out
so they're in his handwriting.

180
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,686
No one has handwriting
like Monsieur Willy.

181
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:11,589
We first meet her,
Monna.

182
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:14,357
She's being held aloft on the
shoulders of her admirers.

183
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:17,628
She's 18, she's gorgeous,
she's dangerous,

184
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,200
she's from the streets, she devours
men, she never wears a corset.

185
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:25,302
And then him,
our hero, Renaud,

186
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:29,106
he's a writer,
he's a genius.

187
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:30,475
He's captivated by her.

188
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:32,509
She seduces him
in her shabby rooms.

189
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:35,679
They have five entire days
of carnal ecstasy,

190
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:38,448
after which she has
this incredible hold on him.

191
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,384
She instinctively understands
his basest desires.

192
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:42,820
And we wonder,
will he ever escape?

193
00:14:42,822 --> 00:14:47,158
Will he ever get back to his wholesome
friends and his burgeoning career?

194
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,561
Or will he be dragged down
by her toxic embrace,

195
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:54,831
forget about his writing, and just
wallow in the sexual quagmire?

196
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,536
It's brilliant.

197
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,573
It will be.

198
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:05,176
Come on, tell me. How
long do you think it will take?

199
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:06,744
- Two or three months.
- No, no, no, no.

200
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:08,613
Weeks, Veber.
It has to be weeks.

201
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:11,282
- Write for four hours at a time.
- All right, all right.

202
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:13,150
Good-bye, Gabrielle.

203
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:14,818
If I get stuck,
I'll come back to you.

204
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,787
Yes, yes,
but write, and fast.

205
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,357
Let's get some money
coming in.

206
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:21,192
Yes, yes, yes.

207
00:15:21,194 --> 00:15:23,394
Oh, God. Chaos.

208
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:27,233
Chaos! Working in these conditions.
It's utter chaos.

209
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:31,701
You married a literary entrepreneur.
It's a phenomenal disaster.

210
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:34,672
You've married a country girl
without a penny to her name.

211
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:36,577
We're doomed, aren't we?

212
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:43,214
It's perfect.

213
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:44,916
But how about, um...

214
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:50,955
Uh, the contract you sent me is eminently fair,
but for one tiny shortcoming... the money.

215
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:52,956
Pump it up
before you prick it.

216
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,926
Get more of a pop that way.

217
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,527
Willy!

218
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,897
Intimacy in all its savage
abandon, my darling.

219
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:02,933
I have meetings later. Let's
meet at La Mascotte at 9:00.

220
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:05,338
No. No, make it 10:00.

221
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,615
He said, "Don't worry,
I've got some cream for that."

222
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,730
Thank you, Madame D'Arsay.

223
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:24,550
No, you're lying.

224
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:45,568
That's 571, Lotte,
for one month.

225
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,003
Well, do you want me
to look cheap?

226
00:17:47,005 --> 00:17:50,040
Yeah. But for that money I can get
laid five times a day by a prostitute.

227
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,980
Oh, my dear.

228
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:58,851
You've come to...
to fetch me?

229
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:03,019
She's not
a disreputable woman.

230
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:04,989
They've even written
a play about her.

231
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:06,790
It was a shit play,
but nevertheless.

232
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:09,626
- Who the hell wrote that letter?
- I don't care who wrote it.

233
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:13,330
Look, Gabrielle, she's no rival to you.
I promise.

234
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,798
Look, I'll never sleep
with her again.

235
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,367
But you have to understand,
this is what men do.

236
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:20,604
We're the weaker sex. We don't have your
strength. We're slave to our urges.

237
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:22,940
- And here in the city, it's perfectly acceptable to...
- Nonsense!

238
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:26,743
I don't accept it. You've been
lying to me all this time.

239
00:18:26,745 --> 00:18:29,079
I wait for you all day long
and I never ask you for anything

240
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,647
because you say
we have no money.

241
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,016
But it's true.
We have no money.

242
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:33,416
Because you spend it all
on her!

243
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,086
- I really don't.
- And then...

244
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:39,522
And then, when you get into bed
and I touch you, and I kiss you,

245
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:41,092
and you say
you're too tired...

246
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:43,493
- No, no.
- I've been unattentive. I'm sorry.

247
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:45,698
- I'll make amends.
- Don't you dare touch me.

248
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:49,436
Gabrielle, I...

249
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:51,969
I gave up my inheritance
for you!

250
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:55,442
- My bloody freedom!
- Go to hell!

251
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:04,318
Oh, no. Ants.

252
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:07,852
Ah, there must be
some honeydew.

253
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:09,586
It feels sticky.

254
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:12,390
Hmm. The white flies
must have got to it.

255
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:14,057
Sucked out all the juice.

256
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,893
We need some ladybirds.

257
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:17,795
Hmm. Or a spider.

258
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:21,164
Got a big one
dangling in my room.

259
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,936
I'll catch her and put
her to work out here.

260
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:32,611
Did you ever feel like you
were playing a part, Sido?

261
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:35,945
In what way?

262
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:37,981
As a wife.

263
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:39,919
Or a mother.

264
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:43,857
Like you were just
going through with it.

265
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:49,896
Sometimes, as a wife.
Never as a mother.

266
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,503
Is he good to you,
Gabri?

267
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:01,775
What is it, my love?

268
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:07,580
It's just... nothing
is how I imagined it.

269
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,384
Oh. Come here.

270
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,786
My little kitten.

271
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:18,923
No one can take away
who you are.

272
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:21,057
No one.

273
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,527
You're too strong
for that.

274
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,565
You always have been.

275
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,799
Just trust no one
but yourself.

276
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,437
I know.

277
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,541
So what's he done
to upset you?

278
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:40,478
Nothing.

279
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,681
Nothing. It's just
new, that's all.

280
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:45,751
I must get used to
marriage.

281
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,690
Better to make marriage
get used to you.

282
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:06,269
- Are you happy to be here?
- Yes.

283
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:10,039
It makes the city
seem even more foul.

284
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,542
Did you miss me at all?

285
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:14,013
No, not really.

286
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,021
Well, life is awful
without you.

287
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:26,557
It's just dead. I... I don't
feel like myself at all.

288
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,728
Everything just seems
utterly pointless.

289
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:32,031
Can't even write
anymore.

290
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:39,202
You mean more to me than all the
women of Paris put together.

291
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:42,038
Have you sampled them all?

292
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,807
Please don't mock me.

293
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:46,042
You're very happy
to mock everybody else.

294
00:21:46,044 --> 00:21:47,310
It's true,
but it's just...

295
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:51,315
Look, it's just horseshit. Words
are deceptive little bastards.

296
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:54,151
But if you trace mine
to their source,

297
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:55,920
to my bruised
and aching heart...

298
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:58,888
Well, I wouldn't credit that
as the organ of origin.

299
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:04,694
I can read you like the top
line of an optician's chart.

300
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:07,000
That's brilliant.
Did you make that up?

301
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:11,669
Just tell me what you
want, Gabrielle.

302
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:13,073
I'll do anything.

303
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:18,041
I know who you are, Willy.

304
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:21,211
Maybe I knew it all along.
But I want you not to lie to me.

305
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:23,582
I won't. Never again. I promise.

306
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,151
I want to be part of things.

307
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:29,752
I don't want to be treated
like some little wife at home.

308
00:22:29,754 --> 00:22:31,790
I want to know
what's going on.

309
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:35,795
You will.

310
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:39,096
You'll be part
of everything.

311
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:40,700
Do you promise?

312
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:43,569
Promise.

313
00:22:57,883 --> 00:23:00,617
When we get back to Paris,
I'll even buy you a dog.

314
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:02,819
I would love that.

315
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:05,288
Look, it's so beautiful.

316
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,925
- Luce and I used to swim here after school.
- You did?

317
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:10,827
She was your best friend,
wasn't she?

318
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:13,631
Yes. We got up to
all kinds of trouble together.

319
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,164
What was she like?

320
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:19,002
She was sweet, but she
was also very annoying.

321
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:20,804
How? In what way?

322
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:22,772
She was clumsy,
more than anything.

323
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:25,108
One day in winter,
when the first snow started,

324
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,278
I made a compact little snowball and
smuggled it into the classroom.

325
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,713
As Mademoiselle Terrain was
writing on the blackboard,

326
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:33,817
I'd take a little nibble of the snow and
then I'd pass it along to the next person,

327
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:34,951
who'd pass it along again.

328
00:23:34,953 --> 00:23:37,721
- Oh, it's freezing.
- Here, get in.

329
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:40,126
I'm like a pot-bellied stove.

330
00:23:43,663 --> 00:23:45,695
It finally got to Luce,
who dropped it.

331
00:23:45,697 --> 00:23:47,263
So we both got detention.

332
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:51,701
- She'd do anything to be close to me.
- I'll bet she would.

333
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:54,007
You're so witty
and clever.

334
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:26,103
Get out! Both of you!
This is harassment!

335
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:28,137
Willy, come on.
You're not being fair.

336
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:30,708
This is the third time I've
had to come here and ask you for it!

337
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,309
- Then stop bloody coming here and asking.
- I am close to being evicted!

338
00:24:33,311 --> 00:24:36,212
You owe me 400 francs. You said you'd
get the advance from Ollendorff.

339
00:24:36,214 --> 00:24:39,916
- And I will, by Friday.
- You said exactly the same thing last week.

340
00:24:39,918 --> 00:24:42,051
A factory needs to pay
its workers, Willy.

341
00:24:42,053 --> 00:24:44,954
Well, then, why don't you go on strike?
Or get another job.

342
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:47,290
Get some other bloody idiot
to hire you.

343
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:48,925
I'll have your money
by Friday.

344
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:52,895
- You'd better bloody have it.
- Such an ass.

345
00:24:52,897 --> 00:24:55,834
- Damn you!
- We'll be back on Friday.

346
00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:02,005
They'd never get a job
on their own.

347
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:04,143
I lend them my name,
my reputation.

348
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:07,076
I take all the risk,
and there's still no money.

349
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:09,313
- We need more output.
- Well, you could get another writer.

350
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:12,149
And pay them with what? We're not
even making a thousand this month.

351
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:15,352
I've got 300 from <i>The Echo,</i>
425 from the latest vamp novel,

352
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:17,354
and just 250
from the music reviews.

353
00:25:17,356 --> 00:25:19,957
- It doesn't even cover the outgoings.
- How can we spend so much money?

354
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:22,092
The mortgage, Matilde,
restaurants...

355
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:24,894
You always pick up the bill, Willy,
no matter how many people join us.

356
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:26,963
- It's expected of me.
- And the races? And the casino?

357
00:25:26,965 --> 00:25:29,199
What do you want me to do? Live
like a monk? Or a peasant?

358
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:32,236
No, I'm just saying
we could economize.

359
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:33,840
You.

360
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:36,240
- You could write.
- What?

361
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:38,541
Those stories you told me
of Saint-Sauveur last year.

362
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:41,246
- My school stories?
- Yes. That could be Willy's next novel.

363
00:25:42,947 --> 00:25:44,948
Well, try it anyway, but try it now.

364
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,252
Start immediately. Aim for four hours
at a time. The wolves are at the door!

365
00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:34,330
<i>My name is Claudine.</i>

366
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:37,300
<i>I live in Montigny.</i>

367
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:40,039
<i>I was born there in 1873.</i>

368
00:26:44,376 --> 00:26:47,146
<i>I shall probably not die there.</i>

369
00:27:01,026 --> 00:27:03,026
Why aren't you sleeping?

370
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:05,298
- I've only just stopped writing.
- Really?

371
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,301
Oh, dear.

372
00:27:12,437 --> 00:27:15,471
- Did you manage four hours?
- Twice that, at least.

373
00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:17,076
You didn't.

374
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:20,611
You must be a natural.

375
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:24,013
I've changed a few things...
for the story.

376
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:26,048
I think it might ruffle
a few feathers back home.

377
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,352
Oh, don't worry
about the facts.

378
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:30,621
You can change events,
add a character.

379
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:33,257
Just adapt it
to the times.

380
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:36,226
All people really want
is the feeling,

381
00:27:36,228 --> 00:27:38,996
the emotion, the great
sweep of narrative.

382
00:27:38,998 --> 00:27:41,265
So you mean I can write
whatever I want?

383
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:43,099
Of course.

384
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:45,469
No one will dispute it.

385
00:27:45,471 --> 00:27:47,537
And if they do,

386
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:50,410
"It's the hand that holds the
pen that writes history."

387
00:28:00,118 --> 00:28:01,951
You're not in the mood?

388
00:28:01,953 --> 00:28:04,890
I'm as weary
as a bear in winter.

389
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:08,126
Save it for the book.

390
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:16,032
<i>These are the copses,</i>

391
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:18,935
<i>where bushes spitefully
catch your face as you pass.</i>

392
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:21,605
<i>Those are full of sun and
strawberries and lilies-of-the-valley</i>

393
00:28:21,607 --> 00:28:23,707
<i>and... snakes.</i>

394
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:26,375
<i>I've shuddered there
with choking terror</i>

395
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:30,547
<i>at the sight of those smooth, cold
bodies gliding in front of my feet.</i>

396
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:33,016
<i>I feel so much alone there,</i>

397
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:35,318
<i>my eyes lost far away
amongst the trees</i>

398
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,288
<i>in the green,
mysterious daylight</i>

399
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,092
<i>that is at once deliciously
peaceful and a little unnerving</i>

400
00:28:42,094 --> 00:28:45,030
<i>because of the loneliness
and the vague darkness.</i>

401
00:29:43,422 --> 00:29:45,223
Well, here we are.

402
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:47,691
You did it.

403
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:50,160
- I take my hat off to you.
- And?

404
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:53,566
It's beautiful. I spent the
whole day in Saint-Sauveur.

405
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,067
- You don't like it.
- I do like it.

406
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:58,570
- Truth?
- Yes.

407
00:30:00,338 --> 00:30:02,471
Yes, they're...
they're really charming.

408
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:05,041
Sorry, I need to...
I need to take a piss.

409
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:07,044
What else?

410
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:08,612
Nothing. It's a...

411
00:30:08,614 --> 00:30:10,482
It's a truly
wonderful depiction.

412
00:30:11,617 --> 00:30:13,182
And?

413
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:16,118
And...

414
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,121
we won't be able
to get it published.

415
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:20,257
That's the shame of it.

416
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:22,028
What's wrong with it?

417
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:25,365
Honestly?

418
00:30:29,835 --> 00:30:33,670
So I'll treat you like any other writer
I'm giving a report to, shall I?

419
00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:35,505
- Yes.
- Except that I love you.

420
00:30:35,507 --> 00:30:37,574
I adore you.
Should be clear about that.

421
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:39,345
Just... Just say it.

422
00:30:42,481 --> 00:30:46,415
There's nothing driving it.
There's no plot.

423
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:50,188
A novel by Willy grips you from
chapter one, whereas yours...

424
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:52,556
There's
too many adjectives.

425
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:54,590
And some of the characters
are interesting,

426
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:58,528
but... it's too cloying.

427
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,299
It's too feminine.

428
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:05,568
- Well, that's a waste of bloody time.
- Not if you enjoyed it.

429
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,406
I wrote it for you!

Wague's mesmerizing,
isn't he?

439
00:32:47,371 --> 00:32:50,472
He's the king of the cantomime.
Let's get a drink.

440
00:32:50,474 --> 00:32:52,642
Thank you, Geraud.

441
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:54,480
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

442
00:32:56,214 --> 00:32:58,882
- How's it going with your book?
- It's gone.

443
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:01,884
- I tried, but it wasn't any good.
- I can't believe it.

444
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:04,688
Willy hated it.

445
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,823
I don't care.

446
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:09,761
- I don't need to leave my mark on the world.
- Hmm.

447
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:15,365
- Have you always written, Schwob?
- I didn't really have a choice.

448
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,601
It was simply there.

449
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:21,238
- Does it make you happy?
- Oh, God, no.

450
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,606
I do it to prevent me
from going mad.

451
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:29,314
But sometimes, occasionally,
it will transport me.

452
00:33:29,982 --> 00:33:31,981
- Hello, Schwob.
- Hello, Gaston.

453
00:33:31,983 --> 00:33:33,586
Good to see you.

454
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:38,821
Jeanne,
may I present Colette?

455
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:40,490
Madame.

456
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:43,893
I think we've been introduced,
but I don't remember that name.

457
00:33:43,895 --> 00:33:46,395
It's new,
in a manner of speaking.

458
00:33:46,397 --> 00:33:50,666
Well, then I shall think of
this as our first meeting.

459
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:59,276
It is so easy.
On. Off.

460
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:01,377
No more sooty candles.

461
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:03,880
Yes, maybe they'll put it
in my building one day.

462
00:34:03,882 --> 00:34:07,983
So much safer too, even if the
light is a little unkind.

463
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:10,488
Nonsense.
Will you excuse me, Arman?

464
00:34:33,912 --> 00:34:36,946
Yes, so, I thought it
was much better than last time.

465
00:34:36,948 --> 00:34:40,917
Let me see your palm.
Oh, how interesting.

466
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:43,687
You have a long life line.

467
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:46,622
And a very strong
head line here.

468
00:34:46,624 --> 00:34:50,392
- And your... your love line splits into three.
- Oh.

469
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:52,696
- What on earth could that mean?
- Who knows?

470
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:54,997
So many intersecting lines.

471
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:56,366
I have the hands
of a man. Look.

472
00:34:56,368 --> 00:34:58,000
- Ah.
- See?

473
00:34:58,002 --> 00:35:00,502
You've a touch
of Hermes, Colette.

474
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:03,339
There's something androgynous about you.

475
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:05,674
- Willy, you ogre, how are you?
- Gaston, Jeanne.

476
00:35:05,676 --> 00:35:08,011
We have been greatly enjoying
the company of Colette,

477
00:35:08,013 --> 00:35:10,546
now that she's no longer hiding
her light under a bushel.

478
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:11,848
Quoting the good book,
Gaston?

479
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,651
You may remember a little verse
about coveting other men's wives.

480
00:35:14,653 --> 00:35:18,455
And you may remember one about not trying
to remove a speck from your brother's eye

481
00:35:18,457 --> 00:35:20,457
with a log in your own.

482
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:23,526
Touché, Gaston. Your wits
are improving... somewhat.

483
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:24,863
Ah, we'd better go now,
darling.

484
00:35:26,464 --> 00:35:28,367
We should go now.

485
00:35:30,602 --> 00:35:33,435
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

486
00:35:33,437 --> 00:35:35,971
His first play
was absolute rubbish,

487
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:39,575
but his mother runs a salon, so,
of course, it was a huge success

488
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:42,946
and he was praised to the skies
for his brilliant writing

489
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:45,448
and his sublime talent.

490
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,683
Unctuous prick.
He was after you.

491
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:49,819
He's not the type,
and they just got married.

492
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:53,055
Yeah, well, they're no longer on
honeymoon, I assure you, my dear.

493
00:35:53,057 --> 00:35:55,794
- Your jealousy is misplaced.
- How so?

494
00:35:57,461 --> 00:35:59,364
It was the wife
I found interesting.

495
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:00,897
Jeanne?

496
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:01,899
Yes.

497
00:36:07,638 --> 00:36:09,709
What would you think
of that?

498
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:12,611
Well, that's...

499
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:16,078
that's a different case.

500
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,716
It is?

501
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:21,486
Perhaps.

502
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,560
Good morning, ma'am. I need to speak
to the gentleman of the house.

503
00:36:31,562 --> 00:36:34,029
- What is it?
- Monsieur Henri Gauthier-Villars.

504
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:35,832
Is he in?

505
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:38,634
- You can speak to me about whatever it is.
- Sorry, ma'am.

506
00:36:38,636 --> 00:36:40,069
- Ah. Sir.
- What is it?

507
00:36:40,071 --> 00:36:44,642
I have a repossession order for two
armchairs, one armoire, one oak desk.

508
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,713
- Let me see the court papers.
- Here you are.

509
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:51,113
All in order?

510
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:53,015
Come on.

511
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:55,618
- Willy!
- It's just bits of wood.

512
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,120
- The armoire's in the bedroom.
- With my clothes in it.

513
00:36:58,122 --> 00:37:00,525
You empty it out.
I'll see to the desk.

514
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:07,533
Oh, be careful.

515
00:37:31,256 --> 00:37:33,256
You ready?

516
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:35,627
Yes. Take it away.

517
00:37:50,742 --> 00:37:54,142
So here, it's, like, "It's
a lovely spring morning."

518
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:55,845
You know,
liven it up a bit.

519
00:37:55,847 --> 00:37:58,580
How about, "Perhaps it's the season.
It's glorious.

520
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:01,787
The sap is rising
almost indecently."

521
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:05,120
And then, yeah, here,

522
00:38:05,122 --> 00:38:07,189
the scene with Luce.

523
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:09,993
I've written, "She brushed
up against me suggestively,

524
00:38:09,995 --> 00:38:14,096
her blue eyes half closed
and her mouth half open."

525
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:16,265
A little louche.

526
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:19,736
Louche sells, trust me. We need
more spice, less literature.

527
00:38:19,738 --> 00:38:21,738
I know what men want.
So do the publishers.

528
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,939
- Do you really think they'll take it?
- Yes.

529
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:27,142
- Ollendorff will go nuts for it.
- As you did on first reading?

530
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:30,515
Never mind about that. Come on. We've
got to work. Work, work, work.

531
00:38:45,863 --> 00:38:50,767
"Claudine is a girl from a small
village, yet she is all of us.

532
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:54,571
Feisty, opinionated,
selfish, and sensual..."

533
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:55,904
Ooh!

534
00:38:55,906 --> 00:38:58,975
"She astounds us
with her moxie, her desires,

535
00:38:58,977 --> 00:39:00,176
and her crimes."

536
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:02,845
Oh!

537
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:07,649
"It took an extraordinary man to
define this modern young woman."

538
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:10,787
Willy, your book
will change the world.

539
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:13,658
- To Claudine!
- To Claudine!

540
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:15,792
Claudine!

541
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:18,328
All of Paris is saying
your husband is a genius.

542
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,696
- And what do you say?
- He is.

543
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:23,832
If that book
is anything to go by.

544
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:25,602
Look at him.

545
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:27,364
I haven't seen him that
happy in a long time.

546
00:39:31,176 --> 00:39:35,877
Well, I have to say, Willy, we've never had
one fly off the shelves like this before.

547
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:39,649
Quite a phenomenon.
Everyone's talking about it.

548
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:41,216
And do you know
who's buying it?

549
00:39:41,218 --> 00:39:43,953
- Young women.
- Really?

550
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:45,687
I thought that...

551
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:47,156
That's interesting.

552
00:39:47,158 --> 00:39:49,859
We've also been having inquiries
about theatrical rights.

553
00:39:49,861 --> 00:39:52,395
- Any thoughts?
- Of course.

554
00:39:52,397 --> 00:39:54,363
The theater's
the next logical step.

555
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:56,299
With as large a stage
as possible.

556
00:39:56,301 --> 00:39:58,968
It's the theater-going public
who will make you rich, Willy.

557
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,370
Maybe even as rich as you one
day, my dear Ollendorff.

558
00:40:01,372 --> 00:40:04,040
What size of print run?

559
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:06,008
Perhaps 30,000 units.

560
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:10,812
I'm waiting to see what sort of
advances the booksellers have got.

561
00:40:10,814 --> 00:40:12,814
What return
will that yield?

562
00:40:12,816 --> 00:40:15,283
About three francs per unit.

563
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:17,956
So, yes, it's a tidy sum.

564
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:21,125
Madame Willy.

565
00:40:22,693 --> 00:40:24,259
- An honor.
- Pleasure to meet you.

566
00:40:24,261 --> 00:40:27,263
Listen, <i>Claudine at School</i> is
heading for her third printing.

567
00:40:27,265 --> 00:40:28,997
Excellent.

568
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:31,299
I believe Willy based Claudine
in part on your school days.

569
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:34,671
Yes, I think I had a little
something to contribute.

570
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:38,875
Well, I'm very glad your experiences
have borne such wonderful fruit.

571
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:40,877
Very nice to meet you,
madame.

572
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:43,312
- Gare de Lyon, please.
- Where are we going?

573
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:45,149
You'll find out.

574
00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:48,986
Hup.

575
00:40:51,823 --> 00:40:54,026
Is something wrong?

576
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:57,196
Well, wh-what
do you think is wrong?

577
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,031
What?

578
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:04,033
Finally
we have a success,

579
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:06,968
and then you imply that I'm
not the true author of it.

580
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,839
- No, I didn't.
- We're holding dynamite here.

581
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:12,008
We've created something
really powerful,

582
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,810
and if it goes off
at the wrong time,

583
00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:15,377
then it could blow
our bloody heads off.

584
00:41:15,379 --> 00:41:17,046
Ollendorff is
your publisher, Willy.

585
00:41:17,048 --> 00:41:18,814
Yeah, well, Schwob
also said something.

586
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:21,786
- Schwob is part of the factory.
- People love to talk.

587
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:27,122
They praise you to your face. Then the moment
you turn around there's knives in your back.

588
00:41:27,124 --> 00:41:29,191
I understand the mentality here.
You don't.

589
00:41:29,193 --> 00:41:32,794
Well, I understand it well enough to
write a book that's the toast of Paris.

590
00:41:32,796 --> 00:41:35,798
Oh, well, why don't you... Go and
just shout it on the streets then.

591
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,236
Tell everybody.
Roll up for the massacre.

592
00:41:42,807 --> 00:41:44,943
I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry.

593
00:41:47,345 --> 00:41:48,946
I'm sorry.

594
00:41:50,214 --> 00:41:52,751
Perhaps I overreacted.

595
00:41:53,785 --> 00:41:56,187
Anyway, I...
I have a surprise for you.

596
00:41:58,122 --> 00:41:59,988
What is it?

597
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,827
Well, then it wouldn't
be a surprise, would it?

598
00:42:04,528 --> 00:42:06,328
So what's that one?

599
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,966
Lime.

600
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:12,100
And that one?

601
00:42:12,102 --> 00:42:13,871
It's a Douglas fir.

602
00:42:16,807 --> 00:42:18,441
How about that one?

603
00:42:18,443 --> 00:42:21,280
Chestnut.
It's a weeping chestnut.

604
00:42:24,182 --> 00:42:26,448
I don't know why
you're so keen on nature.

605
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,884
Animals are vile
to each other.

606
00:42:28,886 --> 00:42:31,921
Animals are honest at least.
They never lie.

607
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:35,993
Yes, my dear. Well, that's
because they don't speak.

608
00:42:38,162 --> 00:42:40,229
Look at that.

609
00:42:40,231 --> 00:42:42,865
Mmm. It's beautiful.

610
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:44,903
I wonder
who lives there.

611
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:48,740
I'm thirsty. Let's see
if they'll stand us a drink.

612
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,776
Willy,
they might shoot us.

613
00:43:07,091 --> 00:43:09,591
Look, wait.
They might be upstairs.

614
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:11,394
Or deaf.

615
00:43:11,396 --> 00:43:14,363
- Deafened by all this country silence!
- Shh.

616
00:43:14,365 --> 00:43:16,098
I thought
I heard something.

617
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,866
Kiss me.

618
00:43:16,868 --> 00:43:19,838
- Willy, someone might come.
- Good.

619
00:43:25,142 --> 00:43:27,142
Put your hand
in my pocket.

620
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:29,278
- There's something there for you.
- Willy.

621
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,783
What?

622
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:42,294
Allow me.

623
00:43:59,943 --> 00:44:01,946
What do you think?

624
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,513
I don't know what I think.

625
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:08,484
- Whose house is it?
- It's for you.

626
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:10,919
My love. My heart.

627
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:13,324
Lest Paris
should drive you mad.

628
00:44:14,524 --> 00:44:17,259
- What?
- It's yours.

629
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:20,298
You're always talking about how
much you miss the countryside.

630
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,000
I don't believe it.

631
00:44:25,002 --> 00:44:27,405
Somewhere for you
to write and be alone.

632
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:30,975
So...

633
00:44:33,577 --> 00:44:35,544
where did you get
the money?

634
00:44:35,546 --> 00:44:38,948
I got an advance
from Ollendorff.

635
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,950
- 25,000 francs.
- For what?

636
00:44:41,952 --> 00:44:43,986
For the next book.

637
00:44:43,988 --> 00:44:46,055
- <i>Claudine in Paris.</i>
- Willy, I-I...

638
00:44:46,057 --> 00:44:48,658
- I can't write another Claudine.
- Just write about us.

639
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,459
Our lives. Our friends. Change
the names and make gossip.

640
00:44:51,461 --> 00:44:53,998
- No, Willy, it...
- Let's talk about the details later.

641
00:44:58,068 --> 00:45:00,137
So, do you like it?

642
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:03,272
It's indescribable.

643
00:45:03,274 --> 00:45:04,573
No such word.

644
00:45:04,575 --> 00:45:08,045
A good writer should be able to
describe anything no matter what.

645
00:45:43,714 --> 00:45:45,316
Is this it?

646
00:45:47,051 --> 00:45:49,187
Your total output
for all these weeks?

647
00:45:51,022 --> 00:45:53,288
I've been doing the house.

648
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:56,691
All the repairs,
the painting, the tiling.

649
00:45:56,693 --> 00:45:58,761
Planting the garden.

650
00:45:58,763 --> 00:46:01,330
Bugger the garden.
We have a deadline.

651
00:46:01,332 --> 00:46:04,403
Well, it's actually quite difficult
to write out here... alone.

652
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:08,537
And I don't want to write
another Claudine.

653
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:11,707
Are you out of your mind? Do you
realize how rare this moment is?

654
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:14,212
When people
are begging for more?

655
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:18,417
Here, come with me.

656
00:46:24,488 --> 00:46:28,457
What would the headmaster do if
Claudine had not done her homework?

657
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:30,359
Willy, don't be silly.

658
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:32,227
What would he do?

659
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:35,631
Make her do lines. Put her over
his knee and tan her hide.

660
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:37,234
Correct.

661
00:46:38,435 --> 00:46:40,539
I'll start tomorrow.

662
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,542
Willy.

663
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:47,243
- Write!
- Willy, let me out!

664
00:46:47,245 --> 00:46:50,111
You will do as I say.
I'll return in four hours.

665
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:52,214
- I expect to see some pages.
- Willy!

666
00:46:52,216 --> 00:46:54,252
Willy, come on.
This isn't funny.

667
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,654
Willy!
Willy, you bastard!

668
00:46:59,656 --> 00:47:03,459
You arrogant bastard!
Let me out!

669
00:47:03,461 --> 00:47:05,093
Willy!

670
00:47:05,095 --> 00:47:07,328
Open the door!

671
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,533
Let me out!

672
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:36,620
Oh, thank you so much.

673
00:48:48,932 --> 00:48:51,135
Ho-ho! Ho-ho!

674
00:49:02,713 --> 00:49:04,680
Colette
and Willy are here.

675
00:49:04,682 --> 00:49:06,318
So they are.

676
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,651
Don't stare.

677
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:09,919
- Sorry.
- Here?

678
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:11,623
Yes. Perfect.

679
00:49:13,524 --> 00:49:14,659
Thank you.

680
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:18,794
Mmm. It's delicious.

681
00:49:18,796 --> 00:49:20,462
Mmm.

682
00:49:20,464 --> 00:49:22,631
Tell me,

683
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:25,267
how many people
in this park right now

684
00:49:25,269 --> 00:49:27,339
do you think are reading
<i>Claudine in Paris?</i>

685
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,540
- I don't know.
- I'd say at least three-quarters.

686
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:34,513
And the rest of them
will soon catch up.

687
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:39,651
What comes here?

688
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:43,618
Monsieur Willy.
Madame Colette.

689
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,290
- I have a note for you.
- Thank you very much.

690
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:48,924
Mrs. Raoul Duval.

691
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:50,825
Oh, Georgie Raoul Duval?

692
00:49:50,827 --> 00:49:52,493
- Yes.
- Wonderful.

693
00:49:52,495 --> 00:49:55,663
Please thank your mistress
and say we accept the invitation

694
00:49:55,665 --> 00:49:57,665
and look forward
to her delightful company.

695
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,303
- Thank you.
- I will.

696
00:50:01,504 --> 00:50:04,305
- Who is she?
- Ah, she's an American.

697
00:50:04,307 --> 00:50:09,477
She's a wayward debutante
from Louisiana

698
00:50:09,479 --> 00:50:14,350
who married a munitions
magnate three times her age.

699
00:50:14,352 --> 00:50:15,950
They sound dull.

700
00:50:15,952 --> 00:50:19,455
He is,
but she's anything but.

701
00:50:19,457 --> 00:50:21,991
We don't have to go
if you don't want to.

702
00:50:21,993 --> 00:50:23,993
No, let's go.

703
00:50:27,298 --> 00:50:29,564
That's so funny.
Did he really say that?

704
00:50:29,566 --> 00:50:32,368
Of course he did.
He's such a colossal snob.

705
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:36,471
Then Madame de Caillavet happened to mention
that he was only a baron, not a marquise.

706
00:50:36,473 --> 00:50:38,506
"Forgive me, madam,"
he replied,

707
00:50:38,508 --> 00:50:41,343
"but I'm also the duke of
Anjou, the bishop of Coutances,

708
00:50:41,345 --> 00:50:44,613
the prince of Joinville,
of Orléans, and the Dunes.

709
00:50:44,615 --> 00:50:46,749
None of which is of the
slightest importance here."

710
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:53,258
Oh, look.

711
00:50:54,758 --> 00:50:55,758
There.

712
00:50:57,827 --> 00:50:59,263
That's better.

713
00:51:05,403 --> 00:51:07,935
- Oh, is the evening over already?
- Thank you, monsieur.

714
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:09,671
I can't bear it.

715
00:51:09,673 --> 00:51:12,006
Oh, Lily, tell the coachman
to go and ready the carriage.

716
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:13,611
Of course.

717
00:51:14,544 --> 00:51:15,977
Well?

718
00:51:15,979 --> 00:51:19,682
I'm sorry, ma'am, but, Monsieur Willy,
may I have your autograph, please?

719
00:51:19,684 --> 00:51:21,383
Of course you can.

720
00:51:21,385 --> 00:51:23,521
Here, I'll even do
a picture for you.

721
00:51:25,356 --> 00:51:26,788
- There you are.
- Thank you so much.

722
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,857
- And yours too, Madame Colette.
- Oh, come now.

723
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:32,430
No, of course. Spirit
should always be rewarded.

724
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:36,999
Thank you.

725
00:51:37,001 --> 00:51:39,403
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.

726
00:51:42,006 --> 00:51:44,573
Well,

727
00:51:44,575 --> 00:51:49,547
I live at 74 Rue Goethe if you'd
like to stop by for a nightcap.

728
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:54,482
I think I'd better retire
for the night.

729
00:51:54,484 --> 00:51:56,685
Oh. Are you sure now?

730
00:51:56,687 --> 00:51:59,754
- Willy?
- We'll play again soon, my dear.

731
00:51:59,756 --> 00:52:03,658
Yes, I hope so, before
my bore of a husband returns.

732
00:52:04,995 --> 00:52:07,629
Well, au revoir.

733
00:52:07,631 --> 00:52:09,434
Au revoir.

734
00:52:15,972 --> 00:52:17,705
You don't want to go?

735
00:52:17,707 --> 00:52:20,778
Well, the invitation
was clearly meant for you.

736
00:52:22,646 --> 00:52:25,649
- Should I?
- Yes, of course.

737
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:28,082
You don't mind?

738
00:52:28,084 --> 00:52:31,854
Well, it would be hypocritical
of me if I did, wouldn't it?

739
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:35,624
You can comfort yourself knowing
that I will be at home lying in bed,

740
00:52:35,626 --> 00:52:38,595
thinking of the two of you
in the fondest way possible.

741
00:53:09,093 --> 00:53:11,396
Come on in.

742
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:17,499
It's a nice place.

743
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:19,970
Thank you. It's my
little pied-à-terre.

744
00:53:21,504 --> 00:53:24,006
Frederick's not so keen
on the art nouveau pieces,

745
00:53:24,008 --> 00:53:26,877
but I love nature...

746
00:53:28,011 --> 00:53:29,645
and women.

747
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:33,115
I can see.

748
00:53:33,117 --> 00:53:37,653
I remember in <i>Claudine at School</i> when all
the girls go swimming together at night.

749
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:40,154
Night is the best time
for a swim.

750
00:53:40,156 --> 00:53:43,892
When I was a girl, I was told that all
the lakes in Louisiana have alligators,

751
00:53:43,894 --> 00:53:49,698
so I never went for a midnight
swim, but I regret it.

752
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,732
When you raise your eyelids,

753
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:54,439
it's as if you are taking off
all my clothes.

754
00:53:55,939 --> 00:53:57,876
Don't look away.

755
00:53:58,943 --> 00:54:00,979
Look at me.

756
00:54:02,111 --> 00:54:03,814
Look at me looking at you.

757
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:17,191
You have
the most beautiful teeth.

758
00:54:17,193 --> 00:54:19,029
Like an alligator.

759
00:54:38,115 --> 00:54:39,982
Morning, my dear.

760
00:54:39,984 --> 00:54:42,651
Have you fed Toby Chien?

761
00:54:42,653 --> 00:54:45,823
Oh, I forgot.
I thought Matilde does that.

762
00:54:50,727 --> 00:54:52,928
So how was last night?

763
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,196
Interesting.

764
00:54:54,198 --> 00:54:56,598
What happened?

765
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,799
What do you think
happened?

766
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:02,136
Ah. Well, don't tell me.
I'll, uh...

767
00:55:02,138 --> 00:55:06,073
I'll wait to read about it, when Claudine
develops tender feelings towards a lady friend.

768
00:55:06,075 --> 00:55:08,810
- I'm not writing about it.
- You must. It's prime material.

769
00:55:08,812 --> 00:55:10,011
No.

770
00:55:10,013 --> 00:55:11,883
Will you see her again?

771
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,618
Possibly.

772
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,662
One moment, my darlin'.

773
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:40,308
- Oh.
- Wonderful. You're... You're here.

774
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,877
I...
I was just passing by.

775
00:55:42,879 --> 00:55:43,981
Yes?

776
00:55:45,582 --> 00:55:47,017
Well, um...

777
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,022
You'd better come in.

778
00:56:03,267 --> 00:56:05,066
How's the writing going?

779
00:56:05,068 --> 00:56:07,102
It's slow and painful.

780
00:56:07,104 --> 00:56:09,971
- How was your meeting at the bank?
- It was good.

781
00:56:09,973 --> 00:56:11,676
Yeah, it was good.

782
00:56:49,379 --> 00:56:51,615
She's expecting you.

783
00:57:03,227 --> 00:57:04,995
Off to the bank.

784
00:57:21,412 --> 00:57:23,747
Georgie,
I know you're in there!

785
00:57:25,281 --> 00:57:26,984
Georgie, open up!

786
00:57:28,818 --> 00:57:30,819
Colette,
I was taking a nap.

787
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:32,953
- Where is he?
- Who?

788
00:57:32,955 --> 00:57:34,992
Colette, what are
you talking about?

789
00:57:38,761 --> 00:57:41,062
<i>Blue cigar
smoke hung in the air.</i>

790
00:57:41,064 --> 00:57:44,066
<i>I marched in and looked
straight in the face of Renaud.</i>

791
00:57:44,068 --> 00:57:46,868
<i>He recoiled, saying, "It was wicked of me.
I'm sorry."</i>

792
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,904
<i>Rezi was there.
Of course she was there...</i>

793
00:57:48,906 --> 00:57:51,372
"Of course she was there,
hurriedly dressing herself.

794
00:57:51,374 --> 00:57:54,910
I shall always remember her
lily-white face decomposing,

795
00:57:54,912 --> 00:57:57,714
as if it were dying
right under my gaze."

796
00:58:01,118 --> 00:58:03,285
It's good.

797
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:05,022
I know.

798
00:58:06,624 --> 00:58:10,357
I'd suggest you change the line where Renaud
says, "It was wicked of me to do it,"

799
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:11,725
but I know you won't.

800
00:58:11,727 --> 00:58:15,196
And what do you think that Renaud
would say in those circumstances?

801
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:18,200
I don't know. Something like, "Why,
my dear, we were waiting for you."

802
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:22,069
- I don't think she'd believe him.
- Of course not.

803
00:58:22,071 --> 00:58:25,372
But don't you think
she's being hypocritical?

804
00:58:25,374 --> 00:58:27,942
I mean, it's acceptable for
Claudine to sleep with Rezi,

805
00:58:27,944 --> 00:58:29,910
but she doesn't want Renaud
to do the same.

806
00:58:29,912 --> 00:58:31,948
Not behind her back,
no.

807
00:58:33,484 --> 00:58:35,316
The betrayal came
when Renaud lied to her.

808
00:58:35,318 --> 00:58:38,088
Renaud, who swore he
would always be honest.

809
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:44,426
Well, perhaps he wanted
to tell her, but he was...

810
00:58:44,428 --> 00:58:46,995
frightened
of her volcanic jealousy.

811
00:58:46,997 --> 00:58:49,734
Well, then, he was a
coward as well as a liar.

812
00:58:51,368 --> 00:58:53,368
You're very harsh on him.

813
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:55,306
If not me,
who else?

814
00:58:57,975 --> 00:58:59,774
And Renaud
would never be jealous

815
00:58:59,776 --> 00:59:01,877
if, for example,

816
00:59:01,879 --> 00:59:04,848
Claudine went off with a
young man for a change.

817
00:59:08,352 --> 00:59:10,384
He would find that
unacceptable.

818
00:59:10,386 --> 00:59:12,254
Oh.

819
00:59:12,256 --> 00:59:15,256
- Infidelity for Renaud is a matter of gender?
- Yes, it is.

820
00:59:15,258 --> 00:59:16,293
Huh.

821
00:59:17,794 --> 00:59:20,395
How long have you known?

822
00:59:20,397 --> 00:59:22,363
About a month.

823
00:59:22,365 --> 00:59:25,302
Well, I must say, I'm impressed by
the way you've handled yourself.

824
00:59:26,502 --> 00:59:28,904
A younger Claudine
would have thrown a fit.

825
00:59:28,906 --> 00:59:31,272
I'm planning on killing
Renaud off in the next one.

826
00:59:31,274 --> 00:59:33,575
What? No, you can't.
No, please, don't.

827
00:59:33,577 --> 00:59:36,781
The hand that holds
the pen writes history.

828
00:59:44,555 --> 00:59:46,354
My husband,

829
00:59:46,356 --> 00:59:49,223
he's just... pure rage.

830
00:59:49,225 --> 00:59:51,526
He wanted to challenge Willy
to a duel.

831
00:59:51,528 --> 00:59:53,294
What?

832
00:59:53,296 --> 00:59:56,333
I put him off. Hopefully
it won't come to that.

833
00:59:58,435 --> 01:00:00,271
You've read it, yes?

834
01:00:01,305 --> 01:00:02,504
I have.

835
01:00:02,506 --> 01:00:04,272
How worried should I be?

836
01:00:04,274 --> 01:00:06,308
It's not blatantly obvious
who is who.

837
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:08,442
- The names have been changed.
- I don't believe you.

838
01:00:08,444 --> 01:00:12,048
Everyone's chattering about it, saying
it will be salacious in the extreme.

839
01:00:13,383 --> 01:00:16,884
I know that you have no time
for me since our separation,

840
01:00:16,886 --> 01:00:20,254
and I know
I behaved badly.

841
01:00:20,256 --> 01:00:21,925
But I'm begging you.

842
01:00:23,126 --> 01:00:26,328
Ask Willy to change it
before publication.

843
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,296
Please, Colette.

844
01:00:28,298 --> 01:00:29,464
One woman to another.

845
01:00:29,466 --> 01:00:31,466
I can't.

846
01:00:31,468 --> 01:00:33,067
You'd let me suffer?

847
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:35,937
It isn't just Willy,
Georgie.

848
01:00:35,939 --> 01:00:38,439
It... It's...
It's the book itself.

849
01:00:38,441 --> 01:00:40,310
Willy thinks
it's a work of art.

850
01:00:48,185 --> 01:00:50,352
You had your chance
to be decent,

851
01:00:50,354 --> 01:00:53,488
but now it will be left to
my husband to settle it.

852
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:58,325
Ollendorff has agreed to a lump sum for
the destruction of the entire print run.

853
01:00:58,327 --> 01:00:59,396
What?

854
01:01:00,497 --> 01:01:02,263
You can't do that.

855
01:01:02,265 --> 01:01:03,665
He's already accepted.

856
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:05,966
That sly bastard.
You can't. You just can't.

857
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:08,102
Well, we have,
and that's how it is.

858
01:01:08,104 --> 01:01:11,208
- You duplicitous bitch.
- I had a good teacher.

859
01:01:33,463 --> 01:01:36,196
And like
a true French heroine,

860
01:01:36,198 --> 01:01:38,399
our daughter Claudine
was burnt at the stake.

861
01:01:38,401 --> 01:01:41,136
I said it would be a hot book.

862
01:01:41,138 --> 01:01:43,537
The thing is,
Ollendorff signed the deal,

863
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:47,174
but he neglected to mention that
he does not own the copyright.

864
01:01:47,176 --> 01:01:49,243
- Because I do.
- Unbelievable.

865
01:01:49,245 --> 01:01:52,446
So it was simply a question of
trotting along to the next publisher,

866
01:01:52,448 --> 01:01:54,515
collecting
a second advance,

867
01:01:54,517 --> 01:01:56,551
and the printing presses are
hard at work as we speak.

868
01:01:56,553 --> 01:01:58,453
How do you two do it?

869
01:01:58,455 --> 01:02:02,424
- I think we got very lucky.
- Not at all. We are with the times.

870
01:02:02,426 --> 01:02:07,294
That cuckolded millionaire and his
voracious wife didn't stand a chance.

871
01:02:07,296 --> 01:02:10,098
We've got the wind under our
wings, and I have a little plan

872
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,667
to turn Claudine into the most popular
girl in France, if not the entire world.

873
01:02:13,669 --> 01:02:16,307
She will literally be
a household name.

874
01:02:17,975 --> 01:02:20,709
My name is Claudine.
I live in Montigny.

875
01:02:20,711 --> 01:02:23,979
I was born there in 1884.

876
01:02:23,981 --> 01:02:26,314
- She's not bad.
- I shall probably not die there.

877
01:02:26,316 --> 01:02:29,383
- Montigny is a village, not a town.
- She's terrible.

878
01:02:29,385 --> 01:02:32,053
Its streets, thank
heaven, are not paved.

879
01:02:32,055 --> 01:02:35,059
Yes, you're right.
Th-Thank you very much.

880
01:02:40,196 --> 01:02:43,230
My name is Claudine.
I live in Montigny.

881
01:02:43,232 --> 01:02:45,533
I was born there
in 1884.

882
01:02:45,535 --> 01:02:47,736
I shall probably not
die there.

883
01:02:47,738 --> 01:02:50,071
Montigny is a village,
not a town.

884
01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:52,707
Monsieur Willy. I am the real Claudine.

885
01:02:52,709 --> 01:02:55,209
- And you are...?
- Me?

886
01:02:55,211 --> 01:02:57,745
- My name is Polaire.
- Polaire?

887
01:02:57,747 --> 01:03:00,615
Polaire.
Pride of Algiers.

888
01:03:00,617 --> 01:03:02,584
Look at her.

889
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:04,218
I mean, look at her.
She's...

890
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:06,187
She instinctively
knows the role.

891
01:03:06,189 --> 01:03:09,457
- She talks about the book as if it was a religion.
- Yes.

892
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:11,995
She's a Sister of Perpetual Claudine.

893
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:14,395
It's strange.

894
01:03:14,397 --> 01:03:18,336
She's started copying my
gestures and mannerisms.

895
01:03:19,435 --> 01:03:22,203
- Really?
- Do you think I could act?

896
01:03:22,205 --> 01:03:24,506
You? No.
It'd be a criminal waste.

897
01:03:24,508 --> 01:03:25,774
Waste of what?

898
01:03:25,776 --> 01:03:29,343
This bobbed haircut. I've never
seen anything like it. Have you?

899
01:03:29,345 --> 01:03:31,982
I always imagined Claudine
with long hair.

900
01:03:33,216 --> 01:03:36,651
Well, that was 19th-century Claudine.
This is now.

901
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:38,520
Look good on you,
actually.

902
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:40,321
Very fetching.

903
01:03:40,323 --> 01:03:43,591
Just think of it. You and
Polaire, the Claudine twins.

904
01:03:43,593 --> 01:03:46,326
- What?
- Yeah. It'd be a publicity gold mine.

905
01:03:46,328 --> 01:03:49,265
- Paris would be all atwitter.
- No. Not in a thousand years.

906
01:03:52,836 --> 01:03:54,472
Evening.

907
01:04:18,294 --> 01:04:21,164
Colette.
You look ravishing.

908
01:04:21,664 --> 01:04:23,300
Thank you.

909
01:04:39,716 --> 01:04:42,252
My name is Claudine.

910
01:04:43,486 --> 01:04:45,620
I live in Montigny.

911
01:04:45,622 --> 01:04:49,093
I was born there
in 1884.

912
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:53,194
I shall probably not
die there.

913
01:04:53,196 --> 01:04:56,663
Of all my novels, this was the one
that would translate to the theater.

914
01:04:56,665 --> 01:04:59,267
I have to give it to you, Willy.
It's a huge success.

915
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:02,736
But now you're such a celebrity, you'll
become even more insufferable than ever.

916
01:05:02,738 --> 01:05:06,207
That's the plan, Veber. That's the plan.

917
01:05:06,209 --> 01:05:08,343
Oh, he is a tease.

918
01:05:08,345 --> 01:05:10,678
Can you believe
this crowd?

919
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,647
Look. Everyone's here. Look.
There's the marquise de Belbeuf.

920
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:17,718
Or Missy, as she's known. She only
shows up for very special occasions.

921
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,687
A woman?

922
01:05:19,689 --> 01:05:22,256
Descended from Empress
Josephine on one side,

923
01:05:22,258 --> 01:05:24,625
the czar of Russia
on the other.

924
01:05:24,627 --> 01:05:27,761
That's how she gets away with
the trousers, even in public.

925
01:05:27,763 --> 01:05:29,466
Fascinating.

926
01:05:37,374 --> 01:05:38,772
Stunning.

927
01:05:38,774 --> 01:05:40,841
Subtle as ever.

928
01:05:58,928 --> 01:06:01,296
Monsieur Willy.

929
01:06:01,298 --> 01:06:03,798
- How was it?
- You were magnificent.

930
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,265
You were perfection.

931
01:06:05,267 --> 01:06:07,604
Thank you, Monsieur Willy.

932
01:06:08,772 --> 01:06:09,937
Colette?

933
01:06:09,939 --> 01:06:13,510
You are her.
The living Claudine.

934
01:06:14,877 --> 01:06:17,212
Polaire,
alight here on my knee.

935
01:06:17,214 --> 01:06:19,714
Tetette, you too.

936
01:06:19,716 --> 01:06:21,352
- Willy...
- Come here.

937
01:06:24,754 --> 01:06:26,553
Behold
the Claudine trinity.

938
01:06:26,555 --> 01:06:29,957
The father, the mother
and the daughter.

939
01:06:29,959 --> 01:06:31,494
Look over here, please.

940
01:06:34,763 --> 01:06:36,564
Claudine, she is a Midas minx,

941
01:06:36,566 --> 01:06:38,700
her smile mysterious
like a sphinx.

942
01:06:38,702 --> 01:06:40,567
She walks, she talks,
she even thinks.

943
01:06:40,569 --> 01:06:42,537
Claudine,
Claudine, Claudine!

944
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:44,504
Claudine's a
girl who knows no bounds,

945
01:06:44,506 --> 01:06:46,307
a fox that can't be
caught by hounds.

946
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:48,609
Exploding star
that makes no sound!

947
01:06:48,611 --> 01:06:50,511
Claudine, Claudine, Claudine!

948
01:06:50,513 --> 01:06:52,580
- Who is this girl in my heart?
- Claudine!

949
01:06:52,582 --> 01:06:54,549
- Who has been right from the start?
- Claudine!

950
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:56,850
- Who is a bit of a tart?
- Claudine, Claudine, Claudine!

951
01:06:56,852 --> 01:06:58,453
Claudine!

952
01:06:58,455 --> 01:07:00,455
- Who is the girl I admire?
- Claudine!

953
01:07:00,457 --> 01:07:01,888
- Who is the queen of desire?
- Claudine!

954
01:07:01,890 --> 01:07:03,691
Who has set Paris
on fire?

955
01:07:03,693 --> 01:07:05,826
Claudine, Claudine,
Claudine, Claudine!

956
01:07:05,828 --> 01:07:07,828
- Who's wearing a schoolgirl's smock?
- Claudine!

957
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:09,631
- Who's causing a hell of a shock?
- Claudine!

958
01:07:09,633 --> 01:07:11,198
Who's working
all round the clock?

959
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,736
Claudine, Claudine, Claudine, Claudine,
Claudine, Claudine, Claudine, Claudine!

960
01:07:15,738 --> 01:07:17,337
And when...

961
01:07:17,339 --> 01:07:18,872
in a dream...

962
01:07:18,874 --> 01:07:22,343
I find myself
next to Claudine

963
01:07:22,345 --> 01:07:24,511
and her magical eyes,

964
01:07:24,513 --> 01:07:26,482
forgetting
all other music...

965
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:28,982
but the laughter
of her voice.

966
01:07:28,984 --> 01:07:30,517
Claudine!

967
01:07:30,519 --> 01:07:33,854
Claudine!

968
01:07:33,856 --> 01:07:35,559
Bravo.

969
01:07:39,796 --> 01:07:42,330
Hello, Toby Chien.
Hello.

970
01:07:42,332 --> 01:07:43,830
Hello.

971
01:07:45,035 --> 01:07:46,868
I'm exhausted.

972
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,836
Oh, me too.

973
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:50,640
More steps
every time.

974
01:07:51,374 --> 01:07:53,441
But what a night.

975
01:07:53,443 --> 01:07:56,613
We have Paris in the
palm of our hands.

976
01:07:59,381 --> 01:08:01,751
- Willy.
- Yes, my dear?

977
01:08:03,952 --> 01:08:05,855
I wondered
if tonight we might...

978
01:08:07,457 --> 01:08:09,393
It would help me.

979
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:39,821
Mmm.

980
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,660
My love.

981
01:08:44,526 --> 01:08:46,864
My Claudine.

982
01:09:50,493 --> 01:09:52,396
Congratulations,
by the way.

983
01:09:53,495 --> 01:09:56,130
It seems Claudines
are everywhere these days.

984
01:09:56,132 --> 01:10:00,033
Yes. There's even been a Claudine
murderess in Marseilles.

985
01:10:00,035 --> 01:10:02,769
She slit
her husband's throat.

986
01:10:02,771 --> 01:10:04,037
Good for her.

987
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:10,710
But seriously, you've
done something important.

988
01:10:10,712 --> 01:10:13,046
You've invented
a type.

989
01:10:13,048 --> 01:10:14,752
Willy has, you mean.

990
01:10:15,552 --> 01:10:17,952
I mean you have.

991
01:10:17,954 --> 01:10:22,393
All those young girls between girlhood and
womanhood, you've given them a voice.

992
01:10:23,193 --> 01:10:24,895
You should
own up to it.

993
01:10:25,962 --> 01:10:27,661
Somebody told you?

994
01:10:27,663 --> 01:10:29,596
I didn't need
to be told.

995
01:10:29,598 --> 01:10:31,534
Meeting you is enough.

996
01:10:33,136 --> 01:10:34,738
It's true.

997
01:10:36,138 --> 01:10:37,673
I wrote them.

998
01:10:39,476 --> 01:10:40,677
It's just...

999
01:10:41,244 --> 01:10:42,880
I know.

1000
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:50,785
<i>I hope the path we
walked today was merely the beginning.</i>

1001
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:55,822
<i>I see your face, Missy...
strong, vulnerable.</i>

1002
01:10:55,824 --> 01:10:57,894
<i>I've never met
anyone like you.</i>

1003
01:10:59,095 --> 01:11:01,127
<i>Polite yet direct.</i>

1004
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:02,833
<i>Reserved yet brave.</i>

1005
01:11:03,632 --> 01:11:06,769
<i>A true gentle man.</i>

1006
01:11:16,678 --> 01:11:18,645
Willy Gauthier-Villars'
residence.

1007
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:23,050
He's busy at the moment.

1008
01:11:23,052 --> 01:11:25,185
- Can I take a message?
- It's the Soumaintrain.

1009
01:11:25,187 --> 01:11:27,121
Reminds me
of Saint-Sauveur.

1010
01:11:27,123 --> 01:11:29,156
Mmm. Oh, yes.

1011
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:31,559
It's delicious.

1012
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:33,664
- When do you go on tour?
- Mmm.

1013
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:35,862
A few weeks.

1014
01:11:35,864 --> 01:11:38,265
Some real fleapits too.
It'll be hell.

1015
01:11:38,267 --> 01:11:40,902
- Why do you do it?
- He might have some time on Thursday.

1016
01:11:40,904 --> 01:11:45,139
I'm addicted. I love every
single dive and wastrel.

1017
01:11:45,141 --> 01:11:46,807
You should
come with us.

1018
01:11:46,809 --> 01:11:49,242
- Can't do cantomime.
- This isn't cantomime.

1019
01:11:49,244 --> 01:11:51,144
This is a new kind
of pantomime.

1020
01:11:51,146 --> 01:11:54,014
- I'll put you down for a half an hour.
- Pure action.

1021
01:11:54,016 --> 01:11:56,751
The right gesture
is worth a thousand words.

1022
01:11:56,753 --> 01:11:59,490
And how do you spell that?

1023
01:12:00,556 --> 01:12:02,188
Excuse me.

1024
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:09,863
- Yes?
- Is Monsieur Willy at home?

1025
01:12:09,865 --> 01:12:12,069
I was hoping
he could sign my book.

1026
01:12:17,707 --> 01:12:19,575
Héon? Another one.

1027
01:12:21,677 --> 01:12:23,911
This way,
please.

1028
01:12:23,913 --> 01:12:25,979
Tell me
more about pantomime.

1029
01:12:25,981 --> 01:12:29,584
Oh, well, it's something I've been
talking about with Christian.

1030
01:12:29,586 --> 01:12:32,586
Just an idea right now. We're
thinking of calling it <i>Flesh.</i>

1031
01:12:32,588 --> 01:12:34,024
Go on in.

1032
01:12:37,627 --> 01:12:39,926
- Monsieur Willy.
- I am he.

1033
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:41,996
Hello.

1034
01:12:41,998 --> 01:12:45,535
Could you sign this?
It's my favorite book.

1035
01:12:46,235 --> 01:12:48,572
Hmm. Thank you.

1036
01:12:49,672 --> 01:12:51,237
To whom
should I inscribe it?

1037
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:52,943
My name is Meg.

1038
01:12:55,078 --> 01:12:56,812
I am the real Claudine.

1039
01:13:01,717 --> 01:13:04,151
- How old are you?
- I'm older than I look.

1040
01:13:04,153 --> 01:13:05,155
I'm 23.

1041
01:13:07,289 --> 01:13:09,626
Well, I'm younger
than I look. I'm 46.

1042
01:13:10,392 --> 01:13:12,693
I don't mind.

1043
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:17,665
Whoa!

1044
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:19,136
- Right ahead!
- There it is!

1045
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:27,241
- Come here, Toby.
- Toby, bring the ball.

1046
01:13:35,418 --> 01:13:38,385
Can you bring it back? Go, Toby!

1047
01:13:42,425 --> 01:13:44,160
Meg's very sweet,
isn't she?

1048
01:13:46,361 --> 01:13:48,632
A little overeager,
but there you are.

1049
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:51,668
Reminds me of you
ten years ago.

1050
01:13:52,435 --> 01:13:55,736
Nothing like.
But she is very sweet.

1051
01:13:55,738 --> 01:13:57,804
- Come on, come on!
- Come on, come on!

1052
01:13:57,806 --> 01:14:00,006
What do you think
of Missy?

1053
01:14:00,008 --> 01:14:01,841
- Toby, come!
- She's very pleasant.

1054
01:14:01,843 --> 01:14:04,013
But she perplexes me.
I'm...

1055
01:14:06,214 --> 01:14:11,452
Words are either masculine or feminine, but
there's no... there's no word for Missy.

1056
01:14:11,454 --> 01:14:14,091
Oh, I could think of
one or two.

1057
01:14:16,059 --> 01:14:18,628
Well, you do seem content,
for once.

1058
01:14:21,297 --> 01:14:23,767
Isn't there
something missing?

1059
01:14:26,269 --> 01:14:27,771
What do you mean?

1060
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:02,402
Are you ready, Willy?

1061
01:15:02,404 --> 01:15:04,807
Yes, I'm ready.

1062
01:15:07,843 --> 01:15:10,079
My name is Claudine.

1063
01:15:10,846 --> 01:15:13,246
I live in Montigny.

1064
01:15:13,248 --> 01:15:15,215
I was born there
in 1884.

1065
01:15:15,217 --> 01:15:16,916
That's right.

1066
01:15:16,918 --> 01:15:19,823
I shall probably not
die there.

1067
01:15:21,891 --> 01:15:23,226
Forty-seven.

1068
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:26,062
Forty-eight.

1069
01:15:27,497 --> 01:15:29,330
Forty-nine.

1070
01:15:29,332 --> 01:15:30,898
Come on.

1071
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,532
Fifty.

1072
01:15:32,534 --> 01:15:35,738
Well done.

1073
01:15:37,774 --> 01:15:40,774
You were married once, weren't you?

1074
01:15:40,776 --> 01:15:43,243
Yes.
It was awful.

1075
01:15:43,245 --> 01:15:46,846
We don't talk anymore, except
through the auspices of lawyers.

1076
01:15:46,848 --> 01:15:48,983
He's embarrassed by me.

1077
01:15:48,985 --> 01:15:53,086
If he was married to me,
what does that say about him?

1078
01:15:53,088 --> 01:15:55,859
It must have been
very hard for you.

1079
01:15:57,025 --> 01:15:58,992
- Putting on trousers, I mean.
- No.

1080
01:15:58,994 --> 01:16:01,394
It was entirely natural.

1081
01:16:01,396 --> 01:16:03,296
I was
a rather awkward child,

1082
01:16:03,298 --> 01:16:07,100
if you can imagine me
in pigtails and a dress.

1083
01:16:07,102 --> 01:16:09,236
I never felt like I belonged,

1084
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:14,274
and then one day I tried on my brother's
school uniform, and that was it.

1085
01:16:14,276 --> 01:16:16,443
I knew I was home
for the first time.

1086
01:16:16,445 --> 01:16:19,145
I've come a long way
since then.

1087
01:16:19,147 --> 01:16:23,017
Of course, it's far easier for
me than for a woman of no means,

1088
01:16:23,019 --> 01:16:26,021
but I wanted to show
that it can be done.

1089
01:16:26,888 --> 01:16:29,055
What about you?

1090
01:16:29,057 --> 01:16:32,559
- What about me?
- Well, I dress as a man.

1091
01:16:32,561 --> 01:16:35,297
Willy dresses you
as a schoolgirl.

1092
01:16:36,364 --> 01:16:38,033
Thank you.

1093
01:16:39,534 --> 01:16:42,603
I do know what's going on, you know.
I'm in on the joke.

1094
01:16:42,605 --> 01:16:45,142
I don't doubt it
for a second, but...

1095
01:16:46,441 --> 01:16:48,177
but are you happy?

1096
01:16:49,311 --> 01:16:50,913
Is anyone happy?

1097
01:16:52,047 --> 01:16:54,184
Willy is demanding, yes,
but...

1098
01:16:55,217 --> 01:16:57,885
he also gives me
a lot of freedom.

1099
01:16:57,887 --> 01:17:00,453
It is a long leash
he keeps you on,

1100
01:17:00,455 --> 01:17:02,825
but it's a leash
nevertheless.

1101
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:06,129
And perhaps
you enjoy that.

1102
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:10,130
- Do you think that's terribly wrong?
- No.

1103
01:17:10,132 --> 01:17:12,169
It's entirely
your business, but...

1104
01:17:13,235 --> 01:17:14,403
Never mind.

1105
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:17,374
But what?

1106
01:17:19,574 --> 01:17:23,078
I wonder if there
will come a time...

1107
01:17:23,613 --> 01:17:25,478
when you must decide,

1108
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,284
are you Claudine
or are you Colette?

1109
01:17:38,561 --> 01:17:40,897
- Hello, Héon.
- Hello, Colette.

1110
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:44,331
What kind of a mood
is he in?

1111
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:46,303
The usual, but worse.

1112
01:17:49,939 --> 01:17:52,939
- Hello there.
- Oh, my word.

1113
01:17:52,941 --> 01:17:55,475
- What are you wearing?
- They're Missy's.

1114
01:17:55,477 --> 01:17:58,414
My dear, I'm surprised you
weren't arrested or beaten up.

1115
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:04,184
You know
the new Claudine book?

1116
01:18:04,186 --> 01:18:05,419
Yes.

1117
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:08,425
Why don't we publish it
under both our names?

1118
01:18:09,958 --> 01:18:12,326
That's out of the question.

1119
01:18:12,328 --> 01:18:14,560
Ollendorff
would never agree to it.

1120
01:18:14,562 --> 01:18:16,129
Ollendorff or you?

1121
01:18:16,131 --> 01:18:21,001
Tetette, do you really want to kill the
goose that's laying the golden Claudines?

1122
01:18:21,003 --> 01:18:23,036
There's very little risk,
surely.

1123
01:18:23,038 --> 01:18:24,938
Claudine's established.

1124
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:28,274
And... most people know.
Or they suspect.

1125
01:18:28,276 --> 01:18:29,475
Nobody knows.

1126
01:18:29,477 --> 01:18:32,578
Unless you've been crowing about
it to your lady man friend.

1127
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,548
- Don't insult Missy.
- Oh, dear.

1128
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,084
She's stripping you of your sense of
humor as well as your common sense.

1129
01:18:37,086 --> 01:18:39,420
- That's not fair, Willy.
- Look, we can't risk it.

1130
01:18:39,422 --> 01:18:42,156
Especially not with our present finances.
We're completely broke.

1131
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:45,591
We're always broke, and yet you gamble
and fill this place with your antiques.

1132
01:18:45,593 --> 01:18:48,094
I bought those from bankrupts
from a debtors' auction.

1133
01:18:48,096 --> 01:18:50,563
The car. The racehorse
that went lame.

1134
01:18:50,565 --> 01:18:54,268
And you, with your funny clothes and your
hats and the exorbitant mortgage on...

1135
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:57,304
- I need my name on the book.
- No. Willy is a brand.

1136
01:18:57,306 --> 01:19:01,041
- And, in any case, women writers don't sell.
- You bastard.

1137
01:19:01,043 --> 01:19:04,178
You fat, smug, lazy,
selfish bastard.

1138
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:08,581
This is utter nonsense. If you felt so strongly,
you should never have agreed to it all.

1139
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:10,117
Goddamn you, Willy.

1140
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:13,290
Without the progenitor,
there would be no Claudine.

1141
01:19:55,096 --> 01:19:56,332
And prepare.

1142
01:20:01,803 --> 01:20:03,770
Breathe.

1143
01:20:03,772 --> 01:20:05,738
Remember
how the cat breathes.

1144
01:20:19,788 --> 01:20:22,124
More animal.

1145
01:20:34,537 --> 01:20:36,670
- Ready?
- Yes.

1146
01:20:36,672 --> 01:20:38,408
Let's get to work.

1147
01:20:55,623 --> 01:20:57,493
And...

1148
01:20:59,695 --> 01:21:02,032
And...

1149
01:21:06,368 --> 01:21:08,501
Are you going to write
today?

1150
01:21:08,503 --> 01:21:10,105
No.

1151
01:21:12,373 --> 01:21:14,410
Rehearsing with Wague
later.

1152
01:21:15,878 --> 01:21:18,181
Well, don't you think
you ought to?

1153
01:21:20,482 --> 01:21:22,849
I should start
locking you up again.

1154
01:21:22,851 --> 01:21:25,087
I would scream
the house down.

1155
01:21:27,589 --> 01:21:30,092
Look, it's a charming
hobby, Tetette, but...

1156
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,426
you're not exactly
Sarah Bernhardt.

1157
01:21:33,428 --> 01:21:34,995
So if you can't pull
it off as high art,

1158
01:21:34,997 --> 01:21:38,564
you're gonna end up doing the bloody music
halls, and that would be scandalous.

1159
01:21:38,566 --> 01:21:42,071
Since when have you considered
scandal to be a bad thing?

1160
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:47,243
That's true.

1161
01:21:48,878 --> 01:21:50,277
What does Missy think?

1162
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:55,282
He's all for it. He comes along with
me to Wague's studio all the time.

1163
01:21:55,284 --> 01:21:57,617
God, how depressing.

1164
01:21:57,619 --> 01:22:01,287
Does she have absolutely no
life of her own whatsoever?

1165
01:22:01,289 --> 01:22:04,359
<i>He</i> does the movements with me.
He's rather good.

1166
01:22:06,162 --> 01:22:09,429
Do you know, Wague thinks that I'll be
ready to go on the stage in a few weeks.

1167
01:22:09,431 --> 01:22:11,932
What do you think, Matilde?

1168
01:22:11,934 --> 01:22:15,402
I have to agree with Monsieur Willy, ma'am.
It's not very ladylike.

1169
01:22:15,404 --> 01:22:17,574
Thought you were on my side.

1170
01:22:19,775 --> 01:22:24,513
So you and the marquise prance around the
studio as potty, mimetic lovers, do you?

1171
01:22:25,814 --> 01:22:28,182
Does Missy share your
ambition to go on the stage?

1172
01:22:28,184 --> 01:22:30,386
No. He's far too shy.

1173
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:35,288
I've had an idea. It'll be
called <i>The Dream of Egypt.</i>

1174
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:37,456
Paris will never have
seen anything like it.

1175
01:22:37,458 --> 01:22:43,132
A scandalous sensation starring Madame
Colette Willy and the Marquise de Belbeuf.

1176
01:22:44,533 --> 01:22:46,532
In a common-or-garden
music hall.

1177
01:22:46,534 --> 01:22:49,271
Can you imagine? It'll be
a full house every night.

1178
01:22:50,306 --> 01:22:52,238
We do perfectly well
with the cancan.

1179
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,640
I've seen it half empty
on a weeknight.

1180
01:22:54,642 --> 01:22:57,376
- You can vouch for the marquise?
- It's in the bag.

1181
01:22:57,378 --> 01:23:00,214
We can even use the Belbeuf
family crest on the poster.

1182
01:23:00,216 --> 01:23:03,817
- The press will go wild.
- Maybe so, Willy.

1183
01:23:03,819 --> 01:23:06,786
- Do you have backers?
- Only need one.

1184
01:23:06,788 --> 01:23:08,223
Myself.

1185
01:23:08,923 --> 01:23:11,291
You're that confident?

1186
01:23:11,293 --> 01:23:13,563
- That's a lot of capital.
- Yes.

1187
01:23:14,829 --> 01:23:16,231
Yes, I am.

1188
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:23,370
Meg.

1189
01:23:23,372 --> 01:23:24,774
You look
beautiful.

1190
01:23:27,309 --> 01:23:29,475
All of our friends
are here.

1191
01:23:29,477 --> 01:23:30,943
Yes.

1192
01:23:30,945 --> 01:23:35,318
Some of Missy's former husband's
friends are here too.

1193
01:23:37,919 --> 01:23:39,719
Here.

1194
01:23:39,721 --> 01:23:41,323
Thank you.

1195
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:53,336
- Bravo!
- Boo!

1196
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:40,310
This is a disgrace!

1197
01:25:45,713 --> 01:25:47,714
Bravo!

1198
01:25:47,716 --> 01:25:50,015
Well done, Colette!
Well done!

1199
01:25:55,123 --> 01:25:57,523
Degenerate! Degenerate!

1200
01:25:57,525 --> 01:26:00,559
What the hell do you think you're playing
at, you uncultured sack of shit?

1201
01:26:00,561 --> 01:26:02,597
You're one of them,
aren't you?

1202
01:26:18,614 --> 01:26:21,447
Madame Colette, what are your
impressions after tonight?

1203
01:26:21,449 --> 01:26:24,017
My "impressions"?
I'm disgusted.

1204
01:26:24,019 --> 01:26:26,085
The people who threw things
tonight are cowards,

1205
01:26:26,087 --> 01:26:29,054
and the only reason I didn't get a footstool
in the face is because I dodged it.

1206
01:26:29,056 --> 01:26:30,624
Let it go, Colette.

1207
01:26:30,626 --> 01:26:32,759
There were some gentlemen
who came for a fight.

1208
01:26:32,761 --> 01:26:34,728
We must ignore them
and go on.

1209
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,162
So you intend
to continue?

1210
01:26:36,164 --> 01:26:37,697
- Yes!
- No!

1211
01:26:37,699 --> 01:26:39,433
Those people don't
frighten me at all.

1212
01:26:39,435 --> 01:26:40,966
Look.
Am I trembling?

1213
01:26:40,968 --> 01:26:44,504
I will continue to pursue
this because I want to,

1214
01:26:44,506 --> 01:26:46,505
and if Paris won't have
me, then so be it.

1215
01:26:46,507 --> 01:26:48,543
I'll go elsewhere
to make a living.

1216
01:27:39,261 --> 01:27:41,497
- Amen.
- Amen.

1217
01:27:42,964 --> 01:27:46,700
Your father was an old soldier.
A good, solid man.

1218
01:27:46,702 --> 01:27:47,970
He was.

1219
01:27:49,805 --> 01:27:50,905
Was.

1220
01:27:54,775 --> 01:27:56,011
I, um...

1221
01:27:58,547 --> 01:28:01,081
I saw our creditors
yesterday.

1222
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:04,149
It's horrific. We lost
everything at the Moulin Rouge.

1223
01:28:04,151 --> 01:28:06,021
- Not today, Willy.
- Colette.

1224
01:28:08,824 --> 01:28:10,956
We need to sell
the country house.

1225
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:12,192
- No.
- We have no choice.

1226
01:28:12,194 --> 01:28:14,094
No.

1227
01:28:14,096 --> 01:28:15,728
No, Willy.
You can't do that.

1228
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:17,764
Well, morally, yes,
I need your permission.

1229
01:28:17,766 --> 01:28:22,538
But... legally,
well, the house is in my name.

1230
01:28:23,571 --> 01:28:25,740
What do you think?

1231
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:30,277
You need to divorce
him, Gabri, and soon.

1232
01:28:30,279 --> 01:28:31,444
Sido, please.

1233
01:28:31,446 --> 01:28:35,881
You ask for a full audit of his accounts.
Willy is a mess.

1234
01:28:35,883 --> 01:28:38,952
A drinker. A gambler. He's
a broken man, Gabrielle.

1235
01:28:38,954 --> 01:28:40,490
Don't say that.

1236
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:44,961
He'll hold you back.

1237
01:28:46,328 --> 01:28:49,966
Gabri, you have to
use your own gifts.

1238
01:28:51,132 --> 01:28:52,965
You know, just...

1239
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:55,935
write something new
under your own name.

1240
01:28:55,937 --> 01:28:57,105
Writing's a nightmare.

1241
01:28:58,839 --> 01:29:01,840
All the hours I spent with
him breathing down my neck.

1242
01:29:01,842 --> 01:29:04,077
The turn of the key in the lock.
The ache in my fingers.

1243
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:05,911
- I'm done with it.
- Oh, no, Gabrielle, just...

1244
01:29:05,913 --> 01:29:09,950
I'm going on tour, Sido, with
Wague, for the next six months.

1245
01:29:09,952 --> 01:29:12,719
The contracts are being drawn up now.
We're doing a new piece.

1246
01:29:12,721 --> 01:29:14,920
- Get out of it. You have to.
- I'm going to do it.

1247
01:29:14,922 --> 01:29:17,092
What did I miss?

1248
01:29:20,262 --> 01:29:22,031
Women. Knives.

1249
01:29:23,097 --> 01:29:24,667
All very Greek.

1250
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:33,005
Montmarault!

1251
01:30:18,854 --> 01:30:21,987
Bravo!

1252
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:23,858
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

1253
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:31,967
Bravo!

1254
01:30:39,373 --> 01:30:40,876
Tell me something.

1255
01:30:42,110 --> 01:30:44,844
The sole rights to the
Claudines, Ollendorff.

1256
01:30:44,846 --> 01:30:46,882
What would you give me
for them?

1257
01:30:47,716 --> 01:30:50,653
Are you serious?
All of them?

1258
01:30:51,419 --> 01:30:52,919
Yes.

1259
01:30:52,921 --> 01:30:54,957
The sole rights
in perpetuity?

1260
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:57,959
Make me an offer.

1261
01:31:10,705 --> 01:31:14,374
We had a cancellation in Limoges next
week, so I've got four days off.

1262
01:31:14,376 --> 01:31:16,276
Will you be coming
back to Paris?

1263
01:31:16,278 --> 01:31:17,977
No.

1264
01:31:17,979 --> 01:31:20,783
I have to pack up the house
at Besançon.

1265
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:25,952
- Will he be there?
- Missy. I've had a long day.

1266
01:31:25,954 --> 01:31:28,455
- Can we just...?
- Of course.

1267
01:31:28,457 --> 01:31:30,226
I'm sorry.

1268
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,362
You know...

1269
01:31:36,364 --> 01:31:39,099
you don't have to worry
about Willy.

1270
01:31:39,101 --> 01:31:42,705
You don't even need to earn your own
money or stay in places like this.

1271
01:31:43,504 --> 01:31:45,404
I could arrange
everything.

1272
01:31:45,406 --> 01:31:47,743
Too much of my life
has been arranged.

1273
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:51,946
And I like
earning my own money.

1274
01:31:53,781 --> 01:31:55,950
I love you.
That's all.

1275
01:31:57,452 --> 01:31:59,919
Thank you.

1276
01:31:59,921 --> 01:32:02,958
That's not the traditional
response, but I'll take it.

1277
01:32:04,092 --> 01:32:05,194
For now.

1278
01:32:09,797 --> 01:32:13,332
You know, I've been thinking about
this new craze for moving pictures.

1279
01:32:13,334 --> 01:32:16,335
Do you think we could adapt
Claudine for a cine-play?

1280
01:32:16,337 --> 01:32:19,104
God, do you never stop?

1281
01:32:19,106 --> 01:32:22,375
We could write a completely fresh story.
<i>Claudine by the Sea.</i>

1282
01:32:22,377 --> 01:32:24,312
No. Adapt one
of the old ones.

1283
01:32:26,547 --> 01:32:28,184
Perhaps.

1284
01:32:34,122 --> 01:32:35,990
Catch.

1285
01:32:37,124 --> 01:32:38,327
Oh, yes.

1286
01:32:39,394 --> 01:32:40,930
How sad.

1287
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:50,536
I've missed you.

1288
01:32:50,538 --> 01:32:53,007
- No, you haven't.
- Of course I have.

1289
01:32:55,276 --> 01:32:59,444
Your ambiguous smile, your lightning
intelligence, your capricious joys.

1290
01:32:59,446 --> 01:33:02,118
Even your brief
but violent furies.

1291
01:33:03,017 --> 01:33:04,819
How's the book going
with Meg?

1292
01:33:06,187 --> 01:33:07,789
Terribly.

1293
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:10,959
All spice
and no literature.

1294
01:33:12,561 --> 01:33:14,897
She's not you.
She never will be.

1295
01:33:16,431 --> 01:33:18,033
What are we doing, Willy?

1296
01:33:19,935 --> 01:33:21,236
Are we finished?

1297
01:33:21,903 --> 01:33:24,039
I don't know.

1298
01:33:26,173 --> 01:33:27,439
You can't.

1299
01:33:27,441 --> 01:33:29,244
- Why can't I?
- Because I love you.

1300
01:33:30,979 --> 01:33:33,580
Because you're the only
woman I could ever love.

1301
01:33:33,582 --> 01:33:36,515
And because you're at your most
brilliant when you're with me.

1302
01:33:36,517 --> 01:33:38,251
Am I?

1303
01:33:38,253 --> 01:33:39,885
Yes.

1304
01:33:39,887 --> 01:33:41,323
You know you are.

1305
01:33:45,025 --> 01:33:47,162
You still need
your headmaster.

1306
01:33:56,605 --> 01:33:59,074
Come in.

1307
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:04,279
May I get in with you,
Gabri?

1308
01:34:05,614 --> 01:34:07,580
Yes.

1309
01:34:07,582 --> 01:34:09,282
Get in.

1310
01:34:09,284 --> 01:34:10,386
Can't sleep.

1311
01:34:11,653 --> 01:34:13,620
Too quiet.

1312
01:34:13,622 --> 01:34:14,957
Listen.

1313
01:34:15,923 --> 01:34:18,092
Silence. It's
terrifying, isn't it?

1314
01:34:18,959 --> 01:34:21,960
No. I love it.

1315
01:34:21,962 --> 01:34:24,199
Of course you do,
country girl.

1316
01:34:34,042 --> 01:34:35,908
Is everything
all right?

1317
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:38,478
There's something
weighing on my mind.

1318
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,915
What?

1319
01:34:43,551 --> 01:34:46,318
I don't sleep with Meg
anymore.

1320
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,989
I mean, we sleep, but...

1321
01:34:49,156 --> 01:34:50,226
I can't...

1322
01:34:51,025 --> 01:34:52,994
Doesn't matter.

1323
01:34:55,462 --> 01:34:56,998
It does.

1324
01:34:59,534 --> 01:35:01,337
Matters very much.

1325
01:35:10,412 --> 01:35:12,210
Bravo!

1326
01:35:12,212 --> 01:35:13,712
Bravo!

1327
01:35:16,418 --> 01:35:19,421
- Colette, how was yours tonight?
- Not bad.

1328
01:35:20,587 --> 01:35:22,554
- And are you going out after?
- Maybe.

1329
01:35:22,556 --> 01:35:24,023
Madame Willy.

1330
01:35:24,025 --> 01:35:27,029
- Ooh-la-la.
- Monsieur Ollendorff. Hello.

1331
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:30,662
I'm here in Lille
on some family business,

1332
01:35:30,664 --> 01:35:33,666
and I was delighted when I found
out you were here with the play.

1333
01:35:33,668 --> 01:35:37,002
- Oh. Well, it's very kind of you to come and see it.
- Quite a spectacle.

1334
01:35:37,004 --> 01:35:42,075
I was thinking if you were free, I'd like
to take you and the marquise to dinner.

1335
01:35:42,077 --> 01:35:44,577
Thank you. I'm always
up for a free feed.

1336
01:35:44,579 --> 01:35:47,013
Especially
in such august company.

1337
01:35:47,015 --> 01:35:50,049
Mmm, it's the very least
I can do for you, Colette,

1338
01:35:50,051 --> 01:35:51,984
after all the money
you've made for me.

1339
01:35:51,986 --> 01:35:54,152
And will continue to make.

1340
01:35:54,154 --> 01:35:57,122
I wish I'd been able to give
Willy a better settlement.

1341
01:35:57,124 --> 01:36:00,326
But one can only pay
what one can afford.

1342
01:36:00,328 --> 01:36:02,194
I'm not quite sure
I understand.

1343
01:36:02,196 --> 01:36:05,534
For the Claudines.
The rights to the Claudines.

1344
01:36:08,669 --> 01:36:10,370
Willy sold you
the Claudines?

1345
01:36:10,372 --> 01:36:12,106
Yes. All of them.

1346
01:36:13,173 --> 01:36:15,207
- He sold you the Claudines?
- Absolutely.

1347
01:36:15,209 --> 01:36:17,210
I'm sorry.
I thought he...

1348
01:36:17,212 --> 01:36:19,214
How much did he get
for them?

1349
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:42,167
I am most insulted by
the implication of your letter.

1350
01:36:42,169 --> 01:36:44,804
We have transacted business
for five years...

1351
01:36:44,806 --> 01:36:46,241
Tetette.

1352
01:36:47,775 --> 01:36:50,011
I need to speak to you
alone.

1353
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,648
I'll see you later.

1354
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:57,453
Willy. Colette.

1355
01:36:59,287 --> 01:37:02,287
- What is it?
- Five thousand francs.

1356
01:37:02,289 --> 01:37:05,258
Don't be melodramatic. I was
trying to keep the house for you.

1357
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:07,660
- I gave you the house.
- We still owed the bank.

1358
01:37:07,662 --> 01:37:11,531
You could have sold Veber's
novels, some of your other trash.

1359
01:37:11,533 --> 01:37:14,399
You just did it to stick the knife in me.
Didn't you?

1360
01:37:14,401 --> 01:37:16,469
Didn't you?

1361
01:37:16,471 --> 01:37:19,404
I wouldn't have got anything for
Veber's, or Schwob's, or anyone else's.

1362
01:37:19,406 --> 01:37:22,175
- Now, please, calm down.
- Why? Why should I calm down?

1363
01:37:22,177 --> 01:37:26,411
Oh, you hurt and you hurt
and you hurt,

1364
01:37:26,413 --> 01:37:29,482
and you think that by saying
"I'm a man, that's what men do,"

1365
01:37:29,484 --> 01:37:32,251
you clear it all away.

1366
01:37:32,253 --> 01:37:36,188
What you did was not just
hateful, it was stupid.

1367
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:38,323
Now we'll have no say
over our books,

1368
01:37:38,325 --> 01:37:40,358
and we'll never make
another penny from them.

1369
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,394
- We can write some more.
- No, never. Never again. Never!

1370
01:37:42,396 --> 01:37:45,298
You're overreacting. This was
purely a business decision.

1371
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,433
Isn't that what our whole
marriage has been?

1372
01:37:47,435 --> 01:37:49,434
Wasn't I the best
investment you ever made?

1373
01:37:49,436 --> 01:37:51,636
No dowry, but my God, she
can write for her keep!

1374
01:37:51,638 --> 01:37:54,173
If you were an investment, you
were a highly speculative one.

1375
01:37:54,175 --> 01:37:56,608
I paid you back
a thousand times.

1376
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:59,112
Please, just stop it! Just
stop talking about money!

1377
01:37:59,114 --> 01:38:01,781
You were my ideal,
my love, my obsession.

1378
01:38:01,783 --> 01:38:04,086
You killed our child,
Willy.

1379
01:38:05,587 --> 01:38:07,122
Those books...

1380
01:38:08,556 --> 01:38:10,259
they were all we had.

1381
01:38:11,493 --> 01:38:14,329
And now they're gone and
there's no chance of repair.

1382
01:38:16,564 --> 01:38:18,865
- My darling, Claudine was only...
- Don't.

1383
01:38:18,867 --> 01:38:23,238
Don't tell me
what Claudine was.

1384
01:38:24,605 --> 01:38:26,675
I am the real Claudine.

1385
01:38:28,775 --> 01:38:32,678
Everything I thought and
felt went into those books.

1386
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:34,216
They were me.

1387
01:38:35,216 --> 01:38:39,551
My childhood,
my memories, my opinions.

1388
01:38:39,553 --> 01:38:41,653
Everything.

1389
01:38:41,655 --> 01:38:44,890
And when I think of
the hours I spent alone,

1390
01:38:44,892 --> 01:38:48,227
slaving away for you,

1391
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:50,862
churning out scenes
just to try and please you,

1392
01:38:50,864 --> 01:38:53,568
I am so ashamed of myself
for that.

1393
01:38:55,336 --> 01:38:58,440
And yet I knew
and you knew...

1394
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,477
that I was bound
to do it.

1395
01:39:04,244 --> 01:39:06,247
You found me
when I knew nothing.

1396
01:39:07,515 --> 01:39:11,716
You molded me to your own
designs, to your desires.

1397
01:39:11,718 --> 01:39:14,689
And you thought that
I could never break free.

1398
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:17,392
Well, you're wrong.

1399
01:39:18,626 --> 01:39:21,396
Claudine is dead now. She's gone.
You betrayed her.

1400
01:39:22,529 --> 01:39:23,598
And I...

1401
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,602
I have outgrown her.

1402
01:39:29,937 --> 01:39:31,707
Please.

1403
01:39:33,675 --> 01:39:35,541
Please, I...

1404
01:39:35,543 --> 01:39:37,542
I was so s...

1405
01:39:37,544 --> 01:39:39,714
I was stupid. I...

1406
01:39:40,714 --> 01:39:42,682
I panicked. I...

1407
01:39:42,684 --> 01:39:45,518
- Please forgive me.
- Good-bye, Willy.

1408
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,819
No, Gabrielle.
Gabrielle, please, no.

1409
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:49,190
Gabrielle!

1410
01:39:49,923 --> 01:39:51,627
My love, stop.

1411
01:39:54,796 --> 01:39:56,498
I forbid you!

1412
01:40:03,238 --> 01:40:04,740
That was my note.

1413
01:40:06,306 --> 01:40:08,974
That's mine.
And that's mine.

1414
01:40:08,976 --> 01:40:10,745
That's mine.

1415
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:15,583
It was a collaboration.

1416
01:40:17,685 --> 01:40:19,588
She really has a nerve.

1417
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,323
And these prove it.

1418
01:40:25,959 --> 01:40:27,762
Would you do me a favor,
Héon?

1419
01:40:29,497 --> 01:40:31,667
Will you destroy these,
please?

1420
01:40:33,301 --> 01:40:35,033
- Are you sure?
- Definitely.

1421
01:40:35,035 --> 01:40:36,969
Burn them.

1422
01:40:36,971 --> 01:40:38,540
Incinerate them.

1423
01:40:39,673 --> 01:40:40,742
All right, Willy.

1424
01:40:43,311 --> 01:40:44,713
I'm going out.

1425
01:41:56,684 --> 01:41:57,886
Shit.

1426
01:42:28,516 --> 01:42:30,919
- Thirty minutes to curtain up.
- Thanks, Wague.

<i>After two years
of music hall and theater,</i>

1428
01:43:07,922 --> 01:43:10,089
<i>I'm still the same,</i>

1429
01:43:10,091 --> 01:43:12,124
<i>face to face
with that painted mentor</i>

1430
01:43:12,126 --> 01:43:15,661
<i>who gazes at me from the other
side of the looking glass</i>

1431
01:43:15,663 --> 01:43:19,735
<i>with deep-set eyes under lids
smeared with purplish greasepaint.</i>

1432
01:43:20,735 --> 01:43:23,835
<i>I know she is
going to speak to me.</i>

1433
01:43:23,837 --> 01:43:28,773
<i>She is going to say, "Is that you
there all alone under that ceiling,</i>

1434
01:43:28,775 --> 01:43:31,779
<i>booming and vibrating
under the feet of the dancers?</i>

1435
01:43:33,047 --> 01:43:36,517
<i>Why are you there all alone?
And why not somewhere else?"</i>

1436
01:43:38,151 --> 01:43:41,655
<i>Yes, this is
the dangerous, lucid hour.</i>

1437

<i>Now, whenever I despair,</i>

1438
01:43:47,528 --> 01:43:50,062
<i>I no longer expect my end,</i>

1439
01:43:50,064 --> 01:43:52,163
<i>but some bit of luck,</i>

1440
01:43:52,165 --> 01:43:54,934
<i>some commonplace
little miracle which,</i>

1441
01:43:54,936 --> 01:43:57,135
<i>like a glittering link,</i>

1442
01:43:57,137 --> 01:44:00,639

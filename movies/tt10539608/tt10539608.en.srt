An outpost child has been left. Sh...

What's your name?

160

Your name... What's your name?

00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,500
[hesitates] She's a...
She's an unidentified child.

162
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,416
She's seven or eight. She's alone.

163
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,833
Somebody has to come back. Sh...

164

00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,166
Is anyone out there?

Hey.

169
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,625
[grunts]

170
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,958
Somebody's gotta be coming back for you,

171
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,083
because I can't help you.

172
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,833
You understand?

173
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,708
I'm the wrong person.

174
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,166
[exhales sharply]

175
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,375
I'm the wrong person.

[oven beeps]

181
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,833
You have any brothers or sisters?

182
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,916
You're not deaf, right?
You can hear me talking?

183
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,125
Hey.

184
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,208
Well, that's clear.

185
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,375
You just can't talk?

186
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,625
Or you won't?

187
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,333
You just want to piss me off.

188
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,125
What is that? Is that an iris?

189
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,375
Is it...

190
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:14,958
Iris?

191
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,708
- Okay.

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,791
Come in, Aether.
This is Barbeau Observatory.

195

That's Aether.

208
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,916
It's a spaceship, far away,

209
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,500
coming back from a planet that we...

210
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,500
We hoped would be our future, but…

211
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,666
Things didn't quite turn out that way.

212
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,250
That's why I have to contact them.

213
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,833
Now, before it's too late.

214
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,833

No.

[wind whipping]

228
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:08,708
[Augustine] The antenna's our problem.
It's not strong enough.

229
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,125
Doesn't matter
what direction we put it in.

230
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:15,916
They're not answering us
because they can't hear us.

Well, that's something.

234
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:59,250
Given all the variables,
the fact that we can't contact

235
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,041
the K-23 colony flight

236

and can't raise Mojave on any frequency,

237
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,958
our obvious conclusion must be…

238
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,750
That the fault lies with us.

239
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:17,583
<i>But we have exhausted
every possible trouble area on our side</i>

You want to be an explorer, Augustine.

It's protected by this mountain range.

00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,875
[woman 1] <i>Then I heard this voice</i>
<i>that was like, "Oh, damn, you smell good."</i>

324
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,750
- [woman 2] <i>What?</i>
- [woman 1]<i> And it was the guy!</i>

325
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,125
- [woman 2] <i>No way, you're lying.</i>
- [woman 1] <i>Why would I lie?</i>

326
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,250
- [woman 2] <i>He did that?</i>
- [woman 3] <i>No, he didn't.</i>

327
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,291
- [woman 2] <i>Oh my God. He did that?</i>
- [woman 1] <i>Yeah, he did.</i>

328
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,708
- [woman 2] <i>But why?</i>
- [woman 1] <i>'Cause I smell good!</i>

329
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:17,291
[woman 2] <i>So, what? He was behind you?</i>

330
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:20,125
[woman 1] <i>He was right behind me.</i>
<i>He came down onto my neck.</i>

331
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,958
It's okay. You can come in.

332
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,916
- [whispers] No.
- [chatter in hologram continues]

333
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,916
- Come in!
- [Sanchez chuckles]

334
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,916
[woman 2]<i> Is he hot?</i>

335
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,958
Okay.

336
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,875
[woman 1] <i>If you're late, you're not hot.</i>
[woman 2]<i> Yeah, but… Okay.</i>

337
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,833
[woman 1] <i>So you don't mind if someone's...</i>

338
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,791
[woman 2] <i>No, I wanted</i>
<i>to know if he was hot.</i>

339
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:37,000
So, this is my sister.

340
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:41,250
And that is my very,
very best friend from high school.

341
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:45,041
- [Maya's friend]<i> So he turns up.</i>
- Oh.

342
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:47,125
[Maya's friend]<i> He turns up.</i>
- Wait for it.

343
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,416
Here it comes.

344
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:54,041
The world's smartest cat, Einstein.

345
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:58,416
[Maya's sister]<i> Hey, baby!</i>
<i>Hey, honeybun.</i> [kisses]

346
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,083
He still likes me best.

347
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,500
[Maya's sister]
<i>I need to hear what happened.</i>

348
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:03,958
[laughs]

349
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:07,375
- [Maya's sister] <i>I don't know.</i>
- [Maya's friend] <i>I told you, the guy with…</i>

350
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,625
<i>Is it the sniffer?</i>

351
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,916
<i>Oh, no! What?</i>

352
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:13,375
[woman on TV] <i>I'm so frightened.</i>

353
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,625
[crying]

<i>I love you, Margaret.</i>

356
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,250
<i>I love you.</i>

<i>I love you.</i>

[Sully] <i>Do you want to change games?</i>

360
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,875
<i>- I'm on about a two-month winning streak.</i>
- [Ade] <i>I'm pacing myself.</i>

361
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:45,291
I got into NASA
'cause I was damn good at mathematics.

362
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:48,166
Now, I don't like to
use the word "prodigy," but...

363
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah, I read your bio.

364
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:53,333
You also broke the family dog's leg
when you strapped it to a wooden rocket.

365
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,625
- That's irrelevant.
- Not to the dog.

366
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,666
[chuckles]

367
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,583
Did you know there are
over 60 billion possible combinations

368
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,666
of rummy hands at the start of the game?

369
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,958
So this little streak you're on…

370
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:12,208
A streak that's lasted from
one side of the universe to the other.

371
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,166
…Is nothing more than
a minuscule blip of luck

372
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,166
among 60 billion possible combinations.

373
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,500
But when you apply…

374
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,916
Genius-level math skills to the equation,

375
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:25,916
you can shift

376
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,333
those combinations to your favor.

377
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,208
Hmm. And that is what you're doing now?

378
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,666
Overpowering me with math?

379
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,583
[chuckles] You, my friend,

380
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:42,250
are what my fellow mathematicians
refer to as… a simpleton.

381
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,500
- Oh! [chuckles] A simpleton!
- [alarm blaring]

382
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:57,375
- We've deviated off course.
- [Ade] How far?

383
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,541
Can't tell yet.
Auto-deactivated at some point.

384
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:03,125
[Ade] <i>Shut us down. Kill the engines</i>
<i>before we get completely sideways.</i>

385
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,625
- Problem with navigation.
- So we're off course. How far?

386
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:07,666
No idea.

387
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,750
Okay, we'll need to figure that out.

388
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,666
What is the variance for the alarm?

389
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,041
- 0.4 degrees.
- And it sounded for what? 80 seconds?

390
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:24,291
- [Maya] <i>At 30,000 miles per hour.</i>
- Plus coast speed after engine kill.

391
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,791
Guidance and telemetry are...

392
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,833
- Non-existent without comms.
- Sanchez, shut off the alarm.

393
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,541

396
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,833
Sully? What do you hear?

397
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:49,666
[Sully over radio] <i>Jupiter probes,</i>
<i>the beacon we left behind at K-23,</i>

398
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,625
the supply probe on its way
there now, some dying satellites...

399
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,291
We can use that.

400
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:58,958
We can reference
the K-23 beacon as our starting point.

401
00:40:59,041 --> 00:40:59,916
It's behind us.

402
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,291
We can still build a course
from there to the satellite.

403
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:03,208
[Ade] Start building.

404
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,000
Sully, get him exact numbers
on the beacon and pulse.

405

[Mitchell] And the hits keep coming.

408
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:19,333
Ten models, ten matching results.

Yes.

412
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:31,500
Yeah, but it puts us in zones
that haven't been cleared for passage.

413
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,666
Any risks you're aware of?

414
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,958
Well, we know
there was meteor activity here,

415
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:39,750
and we can avoid that, but…

416
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:44,625
This area…

417
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:47,625
We haven't mapped.

418
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:49,625
[Maya] Nobody's mapped it.

419

Anyone else have
a better idea of how to get home?

420
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,791
Okay, then. That's our course.

421
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:05,208
Okay, boss, but I sure don't like passing
through zones that haven't been cleared.

Did you tell her about me?

If you want her to know about you,
you can introduce yourself.

Take care of yourself, Augustine.

You know,
this machine was actually designed

- No, you said that, not me.
- Did I say that?

483
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,416
I didn't see it coming either.

Is that your mom?

497
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,041
I knew a face like that once.

498
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:37,208
Yeah. Her hair was
a little different shade, but…

499
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,958
She was as loud as you are quiet.

500
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:48,833
When she'd laugh,
everybody would turn and look.

501
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:52,875
I think she'd laugh so much

502
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:57,166
because she was that much smarter
than everybody else, and she knew it.

I wish you'd tell me

Hey, Iris.

Ask me a question.

there's gonna be every kind of food there.

There's the lab wall.

Stole it from the LM platform support.

Too much blood.

You know, 20 years ago, Kath and I,

A certain amount
of danger is involved, and…

We took that into account.

912
01:37:14,291 --> 01:37:16,541
I was the one
that was supposed to be at risk.

And how it gets used and why.

932
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:25,208
Why one person lives a lifetime

and another only gets a few years.

My daughter, Maria,
she died when she was four.

She would have been the same age as Maya.

01:44:22,458 --> 01:44:23,708
[Augustine] <i>I understand.</i>

963
01:44:28,708 --> 01:44:30,375
Flight Engineer Maya Lawrence,

964
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:33,458
she suffered
an accident during the flight.

965
01:44:40,208 --> 01:44:41,208
I'm sorry.

966
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,041
What you did…

967
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:53,208
You discovered so much up here.

968
01:44:59,166 --> 01:45:00,458
I just point.

969
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:07,750
[Sully] <i>Well, you pointed</i>
<i>to an incredible world.</i>

970
01:45:09,416 --> 01:45:11,208
<i>I wish you could have seen it.</i>

971
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:20,333
[Augustine]<i> Lake Hazen will have to do.</i>

972
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:25,625
How did you end up there?

973
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:33,666
I thought maybe I could help someone.

974
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:37,583
[Sully] <i>Well, you've definitely done that.</i>

975
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:42,708
You know, you're one of the reasons
I joined the space program.

976
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:47,916
You had done some work
with my mother, Jean Sullivan.

977
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:51,208
<i>She brought home a moon rock you gave her.</i>

978
01:45:52,916 --> 01:45:55,125
<i>I thought it was
the most amazing thing ever.</i>

979
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:57,833
<i>It made me want to go up and find more.</i>

980
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:04,583
<i>I wish I could have thanked you
for it in person, Dr. Lofthouse.</i>

981
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:08,208
Augustine.

982
01:46:09,875 --> 01:46:11,250
Augustine.

983
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,416
And I'm Iris.

984
01:46:19,583 --> 01:46:20,708
[voice breaks] I know.

985
01:46:42,791 --> 01:46:44,583
It's very nice to finally meet you.

986
01:46:51,875 --> 01:46:53,791
<i>What's it like there, Iris?</i>

987
01:46:55,291 --> 01:46:56,500
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

988
01:46:58,041 --> 01:46:59,333
It's amazing.

989
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:05,541
The colony site, it feels like Colorado.

990
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:11,125
Have you ever been there,
to the mountains?

991
01:47:12,958 --> 01:47:15,083
- Yes.
- [Sully chuckles]

992
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:20,500
<i>The air is so crisp, and…</i>

993
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:23,958
<i>And the planet has that smell.</i>

994
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:27,583
<i>It's like pine trees
are hidden somewhere underground,</i>

995
01:47:27,666 --> 01:47:29,166
<i>waiting to burst through.</i>

996
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:35,125
<i>First weeks we were there,</i>

997
01:47:35,208 --> 01:47:38,250
<i>I kept looking up,
expecting to see a blue sky,</i>

998
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:39,791
<i>but it was orange</i>

999
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,500
from the light reflecting off Jupiter.

1000
01:47:45,916 --> 01:47:48,041
When the orbit is just right,

1001
01:47:50,041 --> 01:47:51,791
<i>Jupiter feels so close that…</i>

1002
01:47:54,666 --> 01:47:56,666
<i>You're sure you could almost touch it.</i>

1003
01:47:59,041 --> 01:48:02,750
<i>And that light, it makes
all the colors explode, everything.</i>

1004
01:48:04,166 --> 01:48:05,541
<i>Water…</i>

1005
01:48:07,166 --> 01:48:08,500
<i>Flowers…</i>

1006
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:13,833
<i>It's like landing in Oz
and seeing real color for the first time.</i>

1007
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:21,625
<i>I've never seen anything so beautiful.</i>

1008
01:48:30,958 --> 01:48:32,041
<i>Dr. Lofthouse?</i>

1009
01:48:35,166 --> 01:48:36,416
<i>Augustine?</i>

1010
01:48:38,541 --> 01:48:39,833
[static crackles]

1011
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:43,583
Think I lost him.

1012
01:48:49,208 --> 01:48:50,708
I guess it's just us now.

1013
01:48:56,125 --> 01:48:57,125
Just us?

1014
01:49:11,291 --> 01:49:13,291
[instrumental music playing]

1015
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:30,041

1016

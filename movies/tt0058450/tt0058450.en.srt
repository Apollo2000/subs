00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,915
THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG

3
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,235
PART ONE –THE DEPARTURE

4
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,151
Is it ready?

5
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,989
The engine still knocks
when it’s cold, but that’s normal.

6
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,478
Thanks.

7
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,839
Foucher!

8
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,429
Can you stay an extra hour?

9
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,955
Not tonight,

10
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,435
but I think Pierre’s free.

11
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,149
Pierre, can you stay tonight?

12
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,708
Check the ignition
on this gentleman’s Mercedes.

13
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,150
You coming to the game?

14
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,912
No, I can’t.

15
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,992
You going?

16
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,879
Sure am.

17
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,239
Aubin asked me
to stay late – no way!

18
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,312
Tonight’s special.
I’m going to the theater.

19
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,391
What are they performing?

20
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,232
<i>Carmen.</i>

21
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,551
I don’t like opera.

22
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,597
Movies are better.

23
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,388
I’m going dancing tonight.

24
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,750
Give me a smoke.

25
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,752
All that singing
gives me a pain.

26
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,753
I like movies better.

27
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,911
You said that already.

28
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,070
See you guys later.

29
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,393
See you tomorrow.

30
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,869
My love, oh, my love.

31
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,591
Geneviève,
my little Geneviève.

32
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,637
Guy, I love you.

33
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,591
You smell like gasoline.

34
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,391
It’s a perfume like any other.

35
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,718
Guy, I love you.

36
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,955
A customer.
I have to run.

37
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,356
See you at 8:00
in front of the theater.

38
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,677
I thought about you all day.

39
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,674
If you like,
we could go dancing later.

40
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,671
If you wish.

41
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,112
May I help you?

42
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,832
An umbrella.

43
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,039
Where were you?

44
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,229
Just across the street.

45
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,030
Do you know exactly
what you’d like?

46
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,437
An umbrella.
A black umbrella.

47
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,388
Geneviève, show the gentleman
the umbrellas.

48
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,912
Is that you, Guy?

49
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,230
Good evening, Aunt Elise.

50
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,634
Good evening, my boy.

51
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,470
How are your legs?

52
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,594
Fine, my boy.

53
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,750
What are you up to?

54
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,352
I’m hungry.

55
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,269
You’ll spoil your appetite.

56
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,750
I do as I please.

57
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,112
Calm down and talk to me.

58
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,190
I don’t have much time.

59
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,598
You seem very nervous.

60
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,672
I’m going out.

61
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,994
Alone?

62
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,118
That’s none of your business.

63
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,596
I think it is.

64
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,512
With a girl.

65
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,272
Do you love her?

66
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,634
Maybe.

67
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,313
Tell me the truth.

68
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,953
Yes, I love her.

69
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,037
What’s wrong?
Are you crying?

70
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,197
- Don’t be silly.
- Yes, you are.

71
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,829
Is it because you’re all alone?

72
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,718
I’m not alone.
I have my books.

73
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,952
Madeleine’s coming
to give me my shot.

74
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,709
She’ll keep me company.
- What is it, then?

75
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,389
Maybe happiness
makes me sad.

76
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,153
That’s silly.

77
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,238
You big brute,
you’re messing up my hair.

78
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,074
Good evening, Guy.

79
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,151
Good evening, Madeleine.

80
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,832
You look sad.

81
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,310
You seem happy.

82
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,198
Does it show?

83
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,118
I had a terrible time.

84
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,397
- Doing what?
- Persuading Mother.

85
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,551
It was getting late,

86
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,752
and still no sign
of the seamstress.

87
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,788
Look.

88
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,959
Careful.

89
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,868
It’s still full of pins.

90
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,912
You know...

91
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,112
I think
she suspects something.

92
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,273
Who?

93
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,113
Mother.

94
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,279
When I said I was going
to the theater with Cécile...

95
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,628
she gave me a funny look.

96
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,833
- What kind of a look?
- Like this.

97
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,436
She knows very well
that Cécile hates the theater,

98
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,676
and since
I’m a very bad liar –

99
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,398
That’s what you say.

100
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,956
No, I assure you,
I’m very clumsy at it.

101
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,799
I stammered and blushed

102
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,798
and immediately
changed the subject.

103
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,511
Something squeezed.

104
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,678
Something what?

105
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,552
Lemonade.

106
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,278
Same for me.

107
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,193
Do you love me?

108
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,910
A mambo! Come on.

109
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,116
I should have changed shoes.

110
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,000
We’ll have children.

111
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,517
I’ll call my daughter
Françoise.

112
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,153
And if it’s a boy?

113
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,351
It’ll be a girl.

114
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,553
We’ve always had girls
in the family.

115
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,679
One o’clock!

116
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,189
If Mother isn’t asleep,

117
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,751
I’ll never hear the end of it.

118
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,276
I should wear makeup,
don’t you think?

119
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,149
No, you’re lovely as you are.

120
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,716
A little bit here.

121
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,756
Where?

122
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,830
There.

123
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,118
We’ll sell umbrellas.

124
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,438
No, not umbrellas.

125
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,791
We’ll sell the shop.

126
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,396
We’ll buy a gas station.

127
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,676
Why? What an idea!

128
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,279
All white, with an office.
You’ll see.

129
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,949
You’ll smell
like gasoline all day.

130
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,951
It’ll be heaven!

131
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,639
We’ll be very happy.

132
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,396
And we’ll always be in love.

133
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,956
Oh, my love.

134
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,752
You haven’t told your mother?

135
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,273
Not yet.

136
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,630
Why? You’re a coward.

137
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,830
You mustn’t be angry.

138
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,236
I know what she’ll say.

139
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,713
What?

140
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,517
"My little girl, you’re crazy.
Thinking of marriage at your age!"

141
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,153
My little girl, you’re crazy.
Thinking of marriage at 16!

142
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,077
- Seventeen.
- In love!

143
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,350
Am I too ugly or too stupid?

144
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,239
No, you’re not ugly.
You’re no beauty queen,

145
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,555
but you’re not ugly or dumb.

146
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,830
The thing is,
you have plenty of time.

147
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,355
You think you’re in love,

148
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,717
but love is different.

149
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,953
You don’t just fall in love

150
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,676
with some face

151
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,998
you’ve seen in the street.

152
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,273
It’s a young man
I’ve met several times,

153
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,193
and he loves me.

154
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,397
We want to get married.

155
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,154
Have you nothing to say?

156
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,715
I’m flabbergasted!

157
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,351
I went to the theater
with him last night.

158
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,632
Wonderful!
So you lied to me,

159
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,310
and you admit it
without a speck of shame.

160
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,399
There’s no shame
in wanting to get married.

161
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,836
At your age there is.

162
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,996
No, I didn’t mean that.

163
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,756
You’re just a little girl.

164
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,792
You know nothing.

165
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,072
What little you’ve told me
certainly doesn’t help.

166
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,754
When I married your father,
I knew nothing.

167
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,911
That’s nothing to brag about.

168
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,191
- The hardware store, please.
- Next door.

169
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,433
How old is he?

170
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,073
Twenty.

171
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,115
So of course he hasn’t done
his military service.

172
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,632
He lives with his godmother,

173
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,919
the lady who raised him.

174
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,111
I’m all he has,

175
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,191
and you’ll see,

176
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,318
he’s very handsome.

177
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,596
I’ll see nothing of the kind.

178
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,039
But Mother...

179
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,630
Go upstairs now.

180
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,834
It’s time to fix lunch.

181
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,239
Dear God!

182
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,999
Geneviève!

183
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,159
We’re ruined!

184
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,836
You always exaggerate.

185
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,039
80,000 francs due by the 15th –
you think that’s funny?

186
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,510
And if you don’t pay?

187
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,517
They’ll seize our property.

188
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,989
- I’ll get a job.
- What sort of job?

189
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,991
Anything.

190
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,350
At the post office or city hall?

191
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,118
Why not?

192
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,878
You know,
if I get married,

193
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,113
Guy and I will work,
and we’ll help you.

194
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,191
My little girl,

195
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,557
getting married
is out of the question.

196
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,712
Don’t put those there.
You can see you’re in my way.

197
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,355
Anyway,
does he have a good job?

198
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,956
Can he support you
and raise children?

199
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,677
He’s not rich.
We’ll live modestly,

200
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,753
and we won’t have
children right away.

201
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,155
No, but one at least.

202
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,590
Anyway, he won’t be
paying my taxes.

203
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,553
There isn’t a penny left
in the till.

204
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,438
Sell your jewels.

205
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,675
Never!

206
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,394
What good are they?
You don’t even look at them.

207
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,755
What if there’s
an emergency?

208
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,073
Isn’t what’s happening
an emergency?

209
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,074
Impossible!
If I sold my jewels...

210
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,359
I’d feel stripped and naked.

211
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,471
Then find something else.

212
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,750
Something else?
We have nothing.

213
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,956
Then sell the shop.

214
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,429
Foolish girl!
What would we live on?

215
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,036
Well, I guess
jewels are just jewels.

216
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,040
Should I try
a new hairstyle?

217
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,438
My engagement ring.

218
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,598
It’s atrocious.

219
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,599
This bracelet...

220
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,271
I would never wear it.

221
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,275
No one would want that.

222
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,311
What about your necklace?

223
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,198
You think?

224
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,269
That’d be a crime.
No, I’ll never part with it.

225
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,469
- It’s probably fake anyway.
- Come now!

226
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,837
I guess it’s not
that pretty after all.

227
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,948
This afternoon
we’ll go see Mr. Dubourg.

228
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,590
Then I’ll have my hair done.

229
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,116
What a beauty!

230
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,996
Truly marvelous.

231
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,474
Isn’t it?

232
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,673
A very impressive stone...

233
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,358
if I may say so.

234
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,557
Here I have

235
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,949
rubies, sapphires,
and emeralds.

236
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,033
Ali Baba’s cave.

237
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,034
The jewels...

238
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,391
of Sleeping Beauty.

239
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,919
Hello, Mrs. Emery.
Hello, Miss Geneviève.

240
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,230
Hello, Mr. Dubourg.

241
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,711
- If you wouldn’t mind...?
- Please.

242
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,398
The young lady...

243
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,549
has become
a beautiful young woman.

244
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,668
It’s been such a long time...

245
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,719
since I had the pleasure.

246
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,597
But what can I do for you?

247
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,234
You may speak frankly.

248
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,913
We’re in
a very difficult situation.

249
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,517
Geneviève’s grown now
and helps me all she can.

250
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,996
It has nothing to do with her.

251
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,680
But I have heavy expenses,
and I thought –

252
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,038
Well, I have
a payment to meet,

253
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,550
and if I don’t,
the consequences will be dire.

254
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,150
So I come to you
as to my savior.

255
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,593
I hesitated a long time,
but Geneviève,

256
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,518
the very voice
of wisdom and reason,

257
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,870
convinced me.

258
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,678
It breaks my heart

259
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,997
to be forced to give up

260
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,510
this piece of jewelry,
which for me represents –

261
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,749
I understand,
dear madame,

262
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,036
but my business
entails great risks,

263
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,469
and I’m already overextended.

264
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,474
At best I can put
your necklace up for sale,

265
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,151
but for much less
than its true worth.

266
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,429
I can’t buy it myself.

267
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,437
Couldn’t you at least
give me an advance?

268
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,314
As I said,
there’s nothing I can do.

269
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,831
Don’t insist, Mother.

270
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,676
This is a disaster!

271
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,991
Excuse me, but I’m interested.
I’ll buy your jewelry.

272
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,158
I can help you
out of your predicament.

273
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,835
Allow me to introduce myself.

274
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,511
Roland Cassard,
diamond merchant.

275
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,834
But sir –

276
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,951
Don’t worry, madame.

277
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,272
I’m not a philanthropist.

278
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,799
I’ll easily sell this necklace

279
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,236
in Paris or London,

280
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,597
where my business
takes me quite often.

281
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,277
I don’t know if I should.

282
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,839
Please. I’m serious.

283
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,548
I’m ashamed,
yet delighted at the same time.

284
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,717
I don’t have the cash
on me at the moment.

285
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,197
I can write you a check.

286
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,879
There’s no hurry.

287
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,759
Why don’t you stop by
tomorrow

288
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,758
at my shop,

289
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,630
the Umbrellas of Cherbourg?

290
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,711
I’m always there.

291
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,189
Until tomorrow, then.

292
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,272
What time is it?

293
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,717
6:15.

294
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,117
Why hasn’t he come by yet?

295
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,351
Perhaps he’s a crook.

296
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,115
Perhaps he was
leading you on.

297
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,833
You’re imagining things.

298
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,877
What’s the matter with you?

299
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,598
Nothing, Mother.

300
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,191
Then stop pacing.

301
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,233
Where are you going?
- To see Guy.

302
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,239
I forbid you to see that boy.
Stay here.

303
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,392
I wouldn’t want
to be disrespectful...

304
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,432
Glad to hear it!

305
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,319
- but I’m going.
- You’ll stay here!

306
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,633
Besides, Mr. Cassard
will be here soon,

307
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,513
and I’d like you to be here.

308
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,796
- Why?
- Because!

309
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,830
If he’s a crook, as you say,
we’d better deal with him together.

310
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,032
You think
we’re clever enough?

311
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,709
I don’t know, but stay here.

312
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,472
I can’t.

313
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,235
Don’t go.
I don’t want you to leave.

314
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,272
I’d given up waiting.

315
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,834
- Are you crying?
- It’s nothing.

316
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,673
Sometimes
I don’t have the courage

317
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,276
to face my troubles
and my debts.

318
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,598
Haven’t I come to help you?

319
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,717
It’s most kind of you.

320
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,032
I saw Miss Geneviève go by.

321
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,118
I’d have liked to –

322
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,878
She’s gone out.

323
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,999
The life we lead is so sad
for a young girl...

324
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,395
this dreary shop.

325
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,714
I can no longer
keep her entertained,

326
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,355
and I fear
she’ll become depressed.

327
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,556
She’s bored here.

328
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,310
Would you care for some tea?

329
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,438
I’d love some.

330
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,077
We just had
a terrible fight about you.

331
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,599
About me?

332
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,872
She wanted to go out.
I didn’t want her to, and we quarreled.

333
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,833
We’ve been so lonely
since my husband died.

334
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,678
Perhaps you should –

335
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,152
I don’t know –
take her to a show.

336
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,838
Perhaps.

337
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,908
Can you come
to dinner tomorrow?

338
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,958
Geneviève would be happy
to see you.

339
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,759
No, that’s impossible.
I must leave tonight.

340
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,918
I’m going back to Paris,
and tomorrow I’m off to London.

341
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,591
Here’s the money
I promised you.

342
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,909
Give Geneviève
my best regards,

343
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,754
and I shall not fail...

344
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,592
to come visit you...

345
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,673
next time I’m in town.

346
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,756
I was so afraid
I wouldn’t find you.

347
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,799
I’m so happy
to be with you.

348
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,030
I’m laughing
because I realize

349
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,517
how foolish I am
when I’m alone.

350
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,999
I talked to Mother
about our getting married.

351
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,038
She said I was crazy,
of course,

352
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,558
and forbade me
to see you tonight.

353
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,914
I was so afraid.

354
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,673
I’d rather go anywhere,

355
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,274
and never see Mother again,

356
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,914
than lose you.

357
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,678
We’ll get married in secret.

358
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,955
Oh, none of that matters anymore.

359
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,197
There’s no hurry now.

360
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,512
I got my draft notice
this morning,

361
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,355
and I’ll be gone for two years.

362
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,313
So we’ll discuss
getting married later.

363
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,913
With the war
in Algeria right now,

364
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,235
I won’t be back
for a long time.

365
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,390
But I’ll never be able

366
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,717
to live without you.

367
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,231
I just won’t make it.

368
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,075
Don’t go or I’ll die.

369
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,075
I’ll hide you

370
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,074
and keep you with me,

371
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:42,396
but don’t leave me, my love.

372
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,437
You know that’s impossible.

373
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,348
I’ll never leave you.

374
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,077
My love, I have to go.

375
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,676
I want you to know

376
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,119
I think only of you,

377
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,991
and I know you’ll wait for me.

378
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,350
Two years!

379
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,671
Two years of our lives!

380
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,191
Please don’t cry.

381
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,156
Two years –
no, I’ll never manage.

382
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,436
Try to be calm.
We have so little time left.

383
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,276
So little time, my love,
and we mustn’t waste it.

384
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,309
We must try to be happy

385
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,753
and treasure
from our last moments together

386
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,873
a beautiful memory,

387
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,672
a memory
to help us go on living.

388
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,876
I’m so afraid
when I’m alone.

389
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,675
We’ll be reunited
and stronger than ever.

390
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,190
You’ll meet other women

391
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,517
and forget me.

392
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,838
I will love you

393
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,829
to my dying day.

394
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,791
Guy, I love you.

395
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,196
Don’t leave me.

396
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,795
My love, don’t leave me.

397
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,432
Come.

398
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,799
Come, my love.

399
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,270
Oh, my love!

400
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,957
Is that you, Guy?

401
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,593
Good evening, Aunt Elise.

402
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,597
Are you in bed?

403
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,429
I don’t feel too well.

404
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,074
Is there anything you want?

405
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,836
No, nothing.

406
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,834
I just need to rest.

407
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,035
Good night, my child.

408
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,271
I’m afraid.

409
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,713
I love you.

410
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,917
Where have you been?

411
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,912
With Guy.

412
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,712
What did you do?

413
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,194
He’s leaving.

414
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,880
He’ll be gone for two years.

415
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,958
I can’t live without him.

416
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,036
I’ll simply die.

417
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,071
Stop your crying.

418
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,516
Look at me.

419
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,998
People only die of love
in the movies.

420
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,237
It’s too cruel.

421
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,513
Being separated is cruel,

422
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,868
that’s true.

423
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,711
But time sets things right.

424
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,351
You speak of love,

425
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,948
but what do you know of love?

426
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,673
Are you sure
of your feelings?

427
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:08,151
Mother, can’t you see
how unhappy I am?

428
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,237
I know, darling, I know.

429
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,992
I too have loved
and struggled and suffered.

430
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,032
You should listen to me.
- I do listen.

431
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,749
Isn’t it better to wait?

432
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,034
Two years from now

433
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,550
you may have
forgotten Guy completely.

434
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,712
No, I’ll never forget him.

435
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,192
If you still love him
when he returns, you’ll see.

436
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,479
You must believe me
and calm down

437
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,430
and forget
about this whole matter.

438
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,916
Have you had dinner?

439
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,798
Yes, Mother.

440
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,711
Have some fruit.

441
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,032
You need to get your mind off things,
go out and have fun.

442
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,629
It’s not so hard.

443
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,514
You’re young and pretty,
with a quick wit.

444
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,077
You’ll make friends your age...
or maybe older.

445
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,829
Mr. Cassard
came by this evening.

446
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,753
He was sorry
he missed you.

447
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,158
I’m sure he could give you
some good advice.

448
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,552
I can do without his advice,
thank you.

449
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,514
You’re wrong.
I think he’s just the kind of man –

450
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,240
Stop going on about that guy.

451
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,555
You look terrible.

452
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,156
Leave me alone, Mother.

453
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,271
At least give me a kiss.

454
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,392
Trust me. You’ll see.

455
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,150
Look at me, my boy.

456
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,870
I don’t know

457
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,034
if I’ll still be alive
when you return.

458
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,154
But Elise!

459
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,109
No, no "buts."
I’ve had a good life.

460
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,068
I can leave this world
without regret.

461
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,872
This is nonsense.

462
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,399
Right, Madeleine?

463
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,075
Of course.
She’s doing better already.

464
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,393
I’ll meet death before you do.

465
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,949
Joining the army
doesn’t mean going to war.

466
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,235
Before you go,
I want you to know

467
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,029
that everything I have
will be yours.

468
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,238
Don’t forget about me.

469
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,149
Write me from time to time.

470
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,269
Madeleine will keep you informed.

471
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,677
Farewell, my child.

472
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,195
My love...

473
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,358
I’ll wait for you

474
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,597
all my life.

475
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,314
I’ll think only of you.

476
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,994
Stay, don’t go,

477
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,272
I beg you.

478
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,033
Stay, my love.

479
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,518
It’s not time yet.

480
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,030
I’m leaving now.

481
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,829
Don’t watch me go.

482
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,835
I can’t.

483
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,870
I just can’t.

484
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,911
My love.

485
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,759
I love you.

486
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,913
PART TWO – THE ABSENCE

487
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,319
Well?

488
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,078
Well what?

489
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,999
You’re pale as a ghost.

490
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,149
What did the doctor say?

491
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,992
Nothing, really.

492
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,953
That I should rest.

493
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,993
You didn’t need
to see a doctor for that.

494
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,709
I could have
told you that myself.

495
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,319
What else?

496
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,273
He gave me a prescription.

497
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,518
Sedatives, tonics – just stuff.

498
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,996
"Just stuff"?
Then it can’t be very serious.

499
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,918
You know,
if the shop were doing better,

500
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,077
I’d be the happiest woman
in the world.

501
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,395
It’s freezing.

502
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,713
You know
whom I met in town?

503
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,155
Guess.
You don’t want to?

504
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,636
Roland Cassard.
Have you nothing to say?

505
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,513
What do you want me to say?

506
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,716
He’s so incredibly nice!

507
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,037
We talked for over an hour
this morning.

508
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,312
He’s back from the U.S.A.
What a man!

509
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,872
He told me a thousand stories.
I invited him to dinner.

510
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,118
What’s the matter?

511
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,198
Nothing. I’m just tired.

512
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,156
That’s no reason
to sulk like that.

513
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,272
You may be fatigued,
but you’re not dying.

514
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,954
It’s not the fatigue
that saddens me.

515
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,270
It’s the silence.

516
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,235
Guy left two months ago,
and he’s only written once.

517
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,920
Don’t start that again.

518
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,189
If I knew where he was,
I could write to him.

519
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,712
I’m sure they’ve sent him
somewhere dangerous

520
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,638
where he’s risking his life.

521
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,233
It’s much simpler.

522
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,952
Simpler how?

523
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,349
He’s forgotten you.

524
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,431
You don’t know
what you’re saying!

525
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,718
If he were thinking of you,
he would write.

526
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,316
One can always write,
no matter the distance.

527
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,948
It’s nothing.

528
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,994
I got so scared.

529
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,311
I suddenly saw Guy laughing

530
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,029
with another woman.

531
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,391
Come sit down.

532
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,991
I’ll close the shop.

533
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,550
You’re hiding something.

534
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,278
No, I’m not.

535
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,875
It’s serious, isn’t it?

536
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,839
I’m pregnant, Mother.

537
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,475
This is horrible!
Pregnant by Guy?

538
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,309
How could this happen?

539
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,955
The usual way,
I assure you.

540
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,072
Stop joking.
This is serious.

541
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,270
What are we going to do?

542
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,949
What do you mean?

543
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,793
- With the child.
- We’ll bring it up.

544
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,957
- What will we say?
- To whom?

545
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,152
I don’t know.
Our neighbors, our friends.

546
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,788
We have no friends,

547
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,515
and you never speak
to the neighbors.

548
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,439
And Roland Cassard
is coming to dinner!

549
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,869
We’ll have to welcome him
and put on a good front.

550
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,152
With the way you look –
and pregnant!

551
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,390
You needn’t tell him.

552
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,158
Be quiet.

553
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,195
I tremble
just thinking about it.

554
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,635
Go upstairs and lie down.

555
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,313
I feel just fine.

556
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,477
Don’t argue. Obey me.

557
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,432
I’ll fix dinner myself.

558
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,552
Don’t worry.

559
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,159
Perhaps you need some rest.

560
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:09,037
Yes, Geneviève’s been
overdoing it lately.

561
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,470
She’s a bit pale.

562
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:16,156
Why don’t you go live
in the country?

563
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:21,230
The situation
we find ourselves in

564
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,115
is such that,
at least for the time being,

565
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,959
we can’t get away.

566
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,317
Geneviève wouldn’t go alone,

567
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,270
and I can’t leave the shop.

568
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,837
There’s no way out.

569
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,676
It seems you two
can’t be separated.

570
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,836
We’ve practically never
been parted.

571
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,314
I haven’t found the bean.

572
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,988
I found it.

573
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:01,798
You must pick a king
and make a wish.

574
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,480
I have no choice.

575
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,190
You are my king.

576
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,192
Thank you, Geneviève.

577
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,868
Put this crown on.

578
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,751
Do as he asks, Geneviève,
and put it on.

579
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,713
You look like

580
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,998
a <i>Virgin with Child</i>
I saw in Antwerp.

581
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,600
My cheeks are burning.

582
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,668
How funny!
I think I drank too much.

583
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,750
I’ll leave you now.

584
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,075
I’m not feeling too well.

585
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,236
Then I’ll be going.

586
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,952
Please, let’s you and I
chat a bit longer.

587
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,917
Good night, my darling.

588
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,956
I’m really worried.

589
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,795
Geneviève is sad and reserved
and keeps to herself.

590
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,272
I admit I may not always be tactful
and understanding enough.

591
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,034
I’m always afraid
of hurting her.

592
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,958
I don’t want
to sound ridiculous,

593
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:51,116
and my feelings
could seem insincere.

594
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,592
I wouldn’t want you to misinterpret

595
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,711
what I’m suggesting,

596
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,917
for my only desire

597
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,429
is to bring happiness.

598
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,951
I don’t know
if I’ve made myself clear.

599
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,476
To be honest, I don’t understand.

600
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,514
Since the beginning of dinner

601
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,673
I’ve been trying to broach
a subject that’s on my mind,

602
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,833
but my shyness
got the better of my feelings.

603
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,149
I came to ask
for Geneviève’s hand.

604
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,950
I know I’m terribly clumsy.

605
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,798
Not at all,

606
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,354
but this is so unexpected.

607
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,030
Geneviève is still
a child in my eyes,

608
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,836
and the suddenness
of your request is a bit unsettling.

609
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,793
You see, I don’t know
Geneviève’s feelings for you.

610
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,318
She’s only spoken of you
in friendly terms.

611
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:08,357
I wouldn’t want
to pressure her in any way.

612
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,273
We know nothing about you.

613
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,955
Once, years ago...

614
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,154
I loved a woman.

615
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,353
She didn’t love me.

616
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,994
Her name was Lola.

617
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,078
This was years ago.

618
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,471
<i>I was disappointed</i>

619
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,160
<i>and tried to forget her.</i>

620
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,193
<i>I left France...</i>

621
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,600
<i>and traveled</i>
<i>to the ends of the earth.</i>

622
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,836
<i>But life held no allure for me.</i>

623
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,070
<i>Then, by chance. . .</i>

624
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,876
our paths crossed.

625
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,955
The moment...

626
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,392
I saw Geneviève...

627
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,318
I knew
I’d been waiting for her.

628
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,193
Ever since I met her,

629
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,029
life’s taken on new meaning.

630
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,955
I see her
constantly before me.

631
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,955
I live only for her

632
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,432
and think only of her.

633
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,593
I wanted...

634
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,671
to speak to you frankly.

635
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,155
Please don’t be offended.

636
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,478
Of course,
I wouldn’t think

637
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,349
of influencing Geneviève.

638
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,751
Geneviève...

639
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,590
is free.

640
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,319
Tomorrow I go back
to Amsterdam for three months.

641
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,793
Upon my return,
Geneviève can give me her answer.

642
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,510
I don’t know what to say.

643
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,594
No need to say a thing.

644
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,038
Geneviève
will decide for herself.

645
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,393
- You’re not asleep?
- You can see I’m not.

646
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,075
Roland Cassard asked me
for your hand.

647
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,635
I was listening.

648
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,314
You didn’t tell him
I was pregnant?

649
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,229
I didn’t dare.

650
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,758
<i>I’m very proud of you.</i>

651
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,799
<i>François is a pretty name</i>
<i>for a boy.</i>

652
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,076
<i>Time passes slowly here.</i>

653
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,391
<i>All leaves</i>
<i>have been suspended,</i>

654
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,199
<i>and I don’t know</i>...

655
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,312
<i>whether I’ll be returning</i>
<i>to France anytime soon.</i>

656
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,870
<i>My love,</i>
<i>I know you’re waiting for me.</i>

657
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,677
<i>Last night</i>
<i>one of our patrols</i>

658
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,997
<i>fell into an ambush.</i>

659
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,276
<i>Three soldiers were killed.</i>

660
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,715
<i>All the same, I don ’t think</i>

661
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,515
<i>that there ’s</i>
<i>any great danger here.</i>

662
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,395
<i>But it’s strange</i>
<i>how sun and death</i>

663
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,269
<i>travel together.</i>

664
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,558
Geneviève,
come and eat, darling.

665
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,828
"Dear Mr. Cassard,

666
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,997
Mother and I

667
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,511
greatly appreciated
your postcard."

668
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,754
I find all those people
ridiculous.

669
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,911
I hate carnival.

670
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,594
Don’t be bitter, my darling.

671
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,954
It’s incredible
how big you are!

672
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,512
You’re carrying in front.
It will be a boy – or twins.

673
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,074
No, everything’s normal.

674
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,675
I feel wonderful.

675
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,792
You’re like me.
I was delighted, and never sick.

676
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,270
The day before you were born,
I was up on a ladder,

677
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,199
changing the wallpaper
in the shop.

678
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,869
Has the mailman come?

679
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,073
There was nothing but bills

680
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,279
and some advertising.

681
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,598
Why?
Are you still waiting?

682
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,989
In his last letter he wrote

683
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,239
that he was sad
he wouldn’t see me pregnant.

684
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,315
Perhaps it’s just as well.
I look awful.

685
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,479
A pregnant woman
is always beautiful, sweetheart.

686
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,952
That’s true.

687
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,550
Look at this.

688
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,716
A little top, and I saw pretty rompers
at the department store.

689
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,990
Admit you’re pleased.

690
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,516
I’d be more pleased
if the child had a father,

691
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,875
and if you had a husband.

692
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,309
Guy will come back.

693
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,718
Guy... or someone else.

694
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,112
Absence is a funny thing.

695
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:24,631
It feels like Guy’s
been gone for years.

696
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,151
When I look at this picture,

697
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,794
I forget
what he really looks like.

698
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,239
And when I think of him,
it’s this picture I see.

699
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,872
It’s all I have left of him.

700
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,073
You mustn’t smoke.
Be reasonable.

701
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,872
What’s that?

702
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,031
A postcard from Hamburg

703
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,116
from Roland Cassard.

704
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,392
- For me?
- For us. You can read it.

705
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,873
He says he’ll be back soon.

706
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,751
He asks
if you’ve thought it over.

707
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,798
I don’t think
there’s any hurry.

708
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,556
No, but you should
give it some thought.

709
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,520
I am, Mother.

710
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,791
A man comes along
who’s rich and refined

711
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,474
and smitten with you,
and I think –

712
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,956
What are you doing?

713
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,311
Aren’t you feeling well?

714
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,237
I’m fine.

715
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,115
- You’re eating?
- I can’t help it. I’m always hungry.

716
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,112
He’s not a womanizer
or a smooth talker on the prowl,

717
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,392
but a man
who’s lived and suffered.

718
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,834
I know, Mother,
but spare me the sales pitch.

719
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,748
You talk about him
like he’s one of your umbrellas.

720
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,554
Because he’ll protect you!

721
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,954
Very funny!

722
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,595
If you can’t take a little joke,
you’re in sad shape.

723
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,795
Guy may have been
your ideal,

724
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,679
but what future
does he offer you?

725
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,830
You know
I was wooed once too

726
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,878
by a young man
who was not your father.

727
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,992
You’d have done better
to marry him.

728
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,037
You’re right.

729
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,596
But try to understand
that I want you to be happy

730
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,030
and not waste your life
like I wasted mine.

731
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,357
Don’t worry
about my life, Mother.

732
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,150
I have no intention
whatsoever

733
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,034
of wasting it.

734
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,475
Do you think Cassard
will want to marry me

735
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,353
when he sees
I’ve been knocked up?

736
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,033
Watch your language!

737
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,111
All deformed and swollen up!

738
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,232
Neither you nor I
had the courage

739
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,597
to tell him the truth.

740
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,549
At least now it will show!

741
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,718
Do you think
he’ll take me like this?

742
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,030
If he refuses me as I am,

743
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,430
it means he doesn’t have

744
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,716
deep feelings for me.

745
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,236
If, by some extraordinary chance,
he accepts me,

746
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,397
I’ll have no reason
to doubt him,

747
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,711
and I’d be a fool
to turn him away.

748
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,233
So you see,
I’ve been thinking it over,

749
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,591
but this is all so difficult.

750
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:54,400
Why is absence

751
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,593
so heavy to bear?

752
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:07,317
Why is Guy
growing so distant?

753
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:15,954
I would have died for him.

754
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:24,031
So why aren’t I dead?

755
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,469
Look.

756
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,352
What is it?

757
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,192
It’s for you.

758
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,434
Roland sent it.

759
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,832
I can’t accept it.

760
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,150
Do as you like.

761
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,634
We’ll bring
this child up together.

762
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,277
It will be our child.

763
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,434
Please say yes.

764
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,352
Geneviève...

765
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,558
I don’t want all this...

766
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:42,275
to cause you
the slightest grief.

767
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,794
I love you...

768
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,437
Geneviève.

769
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,396
She accepts your offer,

770
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:08,635
seeing how you’re not put off
by the situation she’s in.

771
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,876
But don’t rush her.

772
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,349
She’s so fragile

773
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,710
that the slightest false step

774
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,792
could compromise everything.

775
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:40,674
PART THREE – THE RETURN

776
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,555
NEW OWNER

777
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,433
Madeleine told me everything.

778
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,950
Why didn’t you say anything?

779
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,718
I didn’t want to.

780
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,713
I thought you knew.

781
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,755
Didn’t you suspect anything?

782
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,717
Of course.

783
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:56,868
The last few months
her letters weren’t the same.

784
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,631
She didn’t answer my questions.

785
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,279
She wrote without conviction.

786
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:08,474
But to marry another man!

787
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:13,193
I just thought she was mad at me,
but I didn’t know why.

788
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:16,238
Then there was the hospital

789
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,558
and my letters
that went unanswered.

790
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,073
Nothing’s changed here.

791
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,117
I have.

792
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,800
Now I can go

793
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,751
since you’ve come back.

794
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,277
I’d have been unhappy
not to see you again.

795
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,551
Don’t talk nonsense.

796
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,036
Now make yourself useful,
my boy.

797
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,756
Get me a little herb tea.

798
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,591
Everything’s ready

799
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,398
in the kitchen.

800
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,115
There’s water in the kettle.

801
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,435
Does your leg hurt?

802
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,199
I limp a bit now.

803
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:13,514
It’s like having
a barometer in my knee.

804
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,110
Especially when it rains.

805
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,750
The hospital was
the worst part of all.

806
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,789
But how did it happen?

807
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,995
Returning one night
from maneuvers...

808
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,709
we were attacked
with hand grenades.

809
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,831
It was a common occurrence.

810
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,268
And Madeleine?

811
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,635
She’ll be here soon.

812
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,832
She’s been very good to me.

813
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,638
She’s not married yet?

814
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,154
You know
how sensible she is.

815
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,919
Put this over there
on the table.

816
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,673
What will you do now?

817
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,196
Work...

818
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:12,551
or maybe live
off my pension.

819
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:17,276
Aubin promised
to take you back at the garage.

820
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,076
You liked it there.

821
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,875
Oh, there,
or some other garage.

822
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,515
We’ll see. I have time.
There’s no hurry.

823
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:37,828
The child she was expecting –
you know anything about it?

824
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,636
No, Geneviève left
right after the wedding.

825
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,994
Mrs. Emery stayed

826
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,631
in Cherbourg
a month or two.

827
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,511
Then she sold the shop.

828
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,071
I think they’re in Paris.

829
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,072
You haven’t changed.

830
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,709
I’m happy

831
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,549
that you’re back.

832
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,559
Foucher!

833
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,438
The boss wants you.

834
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,868
Shit!

835
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,468
Did you service
this gentleman’s car?

836
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,879
A complete checkup
on the 26th, right?

837
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,075
It threw two rods this morning.
The engine has to be rebuilt!

838
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,839
A brand new engine –
without a drop of oil!

839
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,430
I’m not accusing anyone,
but those are the facts.

840
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,597
- Did you check the oil gauge?
- Of course.

841
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,957
- You forgot to tighten the plug.
- I know my job!

842
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,991
Change your tone of voice,

843
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,832
and apologize to the gentleman!

844
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,396
I have nothing to apologize for!

845
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,795
You don’t give a damn
about your work now.

846
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,799
Why don’t you buy new overalls
and shave before coming to work?

847
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,758
I’ve had enough!
I’ll find another job!

848
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,033
Ever since that jerk
got out of the service

849
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,714
he’s been acting
like a hoodlum.

850
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,270
What’s gotten into you?

851
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,198
I’m quitting.

852
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,030
I got into it with Aubin
and quit before he could fire me.

853
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,519
What will you do?

854
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,756
Live off my pension.

855
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,751
A dry white wine.

856
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,592
Another one.

857
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,397
Take it out of this.

858
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,115
You don’t have change?

859
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,910
You’re all the same
with your big bills.

860
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,798
What’s it to you?

861
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,757
Do your job and lay off.

862
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,598
Oh, yeah?

863
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,518
Drop it.

864
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,197
What are you looking for?

865
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,230
Nothing.

866
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,436
Then move your ass.

867
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,551
You’re in the way.

868
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,952
Cognac.

869
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,956
Want to dance?

870
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,551
Leave me alone.

871
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,630
Something wrong, baby?

872
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,832
Come with me, if you’d like.

873
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,629
You’re really

874
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,911
a sweet girl.

875
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,675
Bye, Madame Germaine.

876
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,078
Bye, Jenny.

877
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,673
You can call me Geneviève

878
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,791
if you’d like.

879
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,473
You’re going to say
I remind you of someone.

880
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,955
Good-bye, Jenny.

881
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,600
Come back anytime.

882
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,510
Sorry, Madeleine.

883
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,235
I didn’t have my key.

884
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,317
What’s the matter?

885
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,318
Elise died

886
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,556
last night.

887
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:02,680
I can’t stay

888
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,152
in this apartment
any longer.

889
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,470
It makes me too sad.

890
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:11,717
I want to leave soon.

891
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,713
But where will you go?

892
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,751
I don’t know.

893
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,388
You have no family.

894
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,269
Don’t you want to stay here?

895
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,631
- Why?
- To help me.

896
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:30,549
I’ll be all alone.

897
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,877
You don’t need anyone.

898
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,239
I do.
I need you, Madeleine.

899
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,954
Why not just admit
you don’t like being alone?

900
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:52,678
I don’t see
how I could help.

901
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,713
I have no influence
over you.

902
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,754
That’s not true.

903
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,793
I don’t like
what you’ve become.

904
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:13,839
- What’s that?
- An idle loafer.

905
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:17,316
You’re sad and bitter.

906
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,393
You’ve changed a lot.

907
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,716
It’s not my fault.

908
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:27,709
Nothing’s made sense
ever since I came back.

909
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,276
I don’t believe
I can help you.

910
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:35,237
You’re too far away.

911
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,830
What if I asked you to try

912
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,679
despite everything?

913
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:46,152
I’d stay without
a moment’s hesitation.

914
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,112
I’m asking you now.

915
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,075
Then I’ll try.

916
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,310
I’m a little late.

917
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:44,913
The lawyer took forever,

918
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,873
and I stopped by the garage.

919
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,717
Everything’s all settled.

920
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,076
Poor Elise.

921
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,632
Nothing will be left of her.

922
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,593
Oh, no.
Just the opposite.

923
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:04,038
She’ll be part of all we do.

924
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,712
- Are you happy?
- Very.

925
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,878
And I owe it all to you.

926
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,074
It’s true, and you know it.

927
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,917
And you? Are you happy?

928
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,108
Oh, I’m not unhappy.

929
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,196
I wanted to say –

930
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,670
I mean, I’ve been thinking
that if you wanted

931
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,950
to share my life...

932
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,758
if I weren’t too much of a burden...

933
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,590
and – Are you crying?

934
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,597
No.

935
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,315
Did I say the wrong thing?

936
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,632
Not at all.

937
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,991
It makes me so happy,

938
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,153
yet at the same time
it scares me.

939
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,271
You’re scared of me?

940
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,238
No, I mean... that is...

941
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,316
you understand.

942
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,635
Have you stopped thinking
about Geneviève?

943
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,157
Are you sure you really love me?

944
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,318
I’m not scared, but I do wonder

945
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,195
if you’re not acting out of despair.

946
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,039
No, you’re entirely wrong.

947
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:30,791
I don’t want to think
about Geneviève anymore.

948
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,032
I assure you
I’ve forgotten everything.

949
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:37,830
I want to be happy with you.

950
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:41,072
Madeleine, don’t cry.

951
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,232
I don’t have much ambition,

952
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,513
but if I could make
this dream come true...

953
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:54,151
of being happy
with a woman

954
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:59,468
in a life we’ve chosen

955
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:03,429
together...

956
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,958
All done.

957
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,752
It’s beautiful.

958
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,558
You think so?

959
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,510
Your hands are cold.

960
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,393
I’m going out for a while.

961
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,071
Whatever you like.

962
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:53,193
Our little boy wants to see
the toys in the shop windows.

963
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,437
He’s been talking
about it for a week.

964
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:00,868
We’ll go quickly before dinner.

965
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,914
Stop that, François.

966
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,391
You’ll make us deaf.

967
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:14,033
I got you
a lovely Christmas present.

968
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,513
What is it?

969
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,518
It’s a surprise.
You’ll see.

970
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,395
Cover up well.

971
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,835
I love you, Guy.

972
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,952
François,
come put your coat on.

973
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,634
Say hi
to Santa Claus for me.

974
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,311
See you in a while.

975
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,833
Françoise, stop that.

976
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,152
The horn is not a toy.

977
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,751
It’s cold.

978
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,476
Come in the office.

979
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,916
It’s better in here.

980
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:35,472
This is my first time
back in Cherbourg

981
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,992
since I got married.

982
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,312
I went to pick up
my daughter

983
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,557
at my mother-in-law’s
in Anjou.

984
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,875
On my way back to Paris

985
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,390
I decided to make a detour.

986
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:01,511
I never thought
I’d run into you.

987
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:05,432
As fate would have it...

988
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,719
Fill it up, ma’am?

989
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,473
Yes, fill it up.

990
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,471
Super or regular?

991
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,477
It doesn’t matter.

992
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,636
Whichever you prefer.
Super?

993
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,270
It’s a pretty tree.

994
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,595
Did you decorate it?

995
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:37,038
No, my wife did.
It’s mostly for the kid.

996
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,272
Of course.

997
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,111
Are you in mourning?

998
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,232
Mother died last autumn.

999
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,153
What did you name her?

1000
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,271
Françoise.

1001
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,791
She’s so much like you.

1002
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,234
Do you want to see her?

1003
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:17,318
I think you can go now.

1004
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,794
Are you doing well?

1005
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,672
Yes, very well.

1006
01:30:33,305 --> 01:31:33,901

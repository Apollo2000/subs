1
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,890
May, 1945.

2
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,490
The hot New Mexico desert

3
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,690
seemed far from the
ravages of war in Europe.

4
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,100
100 tons of TNT.

5
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,350
A rehearsal,

6
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,190
to scale and calibrate the power
of an untested atomic weapon.

7
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,690
Two months from this day,

8
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,090
Man would unleash the destructive power
of a demon locked within

9
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,390
the very fabric of matter,

10
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,600
and plunge the world
in the Atomic Age.

11
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,930
For the next 20 years,

12
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,670
testing the power of
the atomic bomb

13
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,920
would hold the world captive
by events shrouded in secrecy.

14
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,690
Events set into motion
seven years earlier.

15
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,690
<i>March, 1938.</i>

16
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,540
<i>Hitler invades Austria.</i>

17
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,070
<i>The Third Reich begins to flex
its military muscle.</i>

18
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,220
<i>Later that year,
German scientists</i>

19
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,090
<i>discover fission
of the uranium nucleus</i>

20
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,510
<i>bringing the Third Reich
one step closer to</i>

21
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,890
<i>discovering the secret
of the atomic bomb.</i>

22
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,760
<i>Fear of German research</i>

23
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,700
<i>stimulated activity in
the United States and England.</i>

24
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,680
<i>Fear that German scientists</i>

25
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,910
<i>could produce weapons
of great devastation.</i>

26
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:54,100
<i>In the fall of 1939,
Dr. Albert Einstein</i>

27
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,200
<i>wrote his now-famous letter
to President Roosevelt,</i>

28
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,410
<i>explaining the urgency of work
on uranium fission.</i>

29
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,210
<i>Roosevelt, a man of action,
moved swiftly.</i>

30
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,590
<i>An advisory committee
on uranium was appointed.</i>

31
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,950
<i>German forces invade Poland,</i>

32
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,490
<i>plunging the nations of Europe
into a second World War.</i>

33
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,540
<i>A new branch of the Army's Corps of Engineers
was established to administer work</i>

34
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,190
<i>on military uses of uranium.</i>

35
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,890
<i>Major General Leslie R. Groves,
the man in responsible for the Pentagon,</i>

36
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,910
<i>was placed in charge
of the project.</i>

37
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,700
<i>On December 2, the first
self-sustaining chain-reacting pile</i>

38
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,880
<i>was successfully operated by Enrico Fermi.</i>

39
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,990
<i>Fermi's success brought intense efforts</i>

40
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,450
<i>between government
and the private sector,</i>

41
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,860
<i>creating huge industries
for uranium separation</i>

42
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,690
<i>in the town of Oakridge, Tennessee,</i>

43
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,570
<i>and for the production of plutonium
in Hanford, Washington</i>

44
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,090
<i>at the shores
of the mighty Columbia River.</i>

45
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,240
<i>This tremendous effort
forged the materials necessary</i>

46
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,190
<i>for creating an atomic bomb.</i>

47
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,930
<i>The first atomic bomb
was assembled at Los Alamos,</i>

48
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,890
<i>a secret laboratory in New Mexico.</i>

49
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,170
<i>When Dr. J.R. Oppenheimer
arrived to take charge,</i>

50
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,360
<i>he began to surround himself with a galaxy
of outstanding scientific stars.</i>

51
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,300
<i>From Los Alamos came the bomb design,
and treatment of</i>

52
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,520
<i>many theoretical problems.</i>

53
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,330
<i>Yet many questions still remain unanswered.</i>

54
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,170
<i>What are the secrets of this new
source of power and destruction?</i>

55
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,660
<i>Knowledge and information on
all aspects of this new weapon</i>

56
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,840
<i>are essential,</i>

57
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,420
<i>and can only be discovered
by further testing.</i>

58
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:57,140
I had a very good friend, a Hungarian
10 years older than I, Leף Szilבrd.

59
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,580
He had a very independent mind,

60
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,410
and a great feeling what is coming.

61
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,310
He saw years ahead

62
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,350
that nuclear explosives would become important.

63
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,850
He was a friend, and I helped him.

64
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,530
For instance, I drove him to
an important interview with Einstein

65
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,790
where Einstein wrote the
famous letter to Roosevelt.

66
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,230
That started things going.

67
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,470
I myself was interested in theoretical physics,

68
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,580
in explaining atoms, molecular vibrations,
knowledge, and more knowledge.

69
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,170
I didn't want to do it. But then...

70
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:46,210
Hitler not only swallowed up
half of Poland,

71
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,570
he invaded the West.

72
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,900
And two days later, there was
an invitation to a Pan-American Congress

73
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,960
where Roosevelt, whom I had never
seen before, was going to speak.

74
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,580
And he made a remarkable speech,

75
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,840
how the world is really endangered by Hitler.

76
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,750
Among other things,
and at the climax, he said:

77
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,700
"You scientists are blamed
for the weapons to be used.

78
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,920
But I tell you,

79
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:27,360
that if you now won't work on weapons,
the freedom of the world will be lost."

80
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,690
Now, you know, I had the feeling
that Roosevelt was talking to me.

81
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,800
I was there when the letter was signed

82
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,310
that awoke his interest
in nuclear energy.

83
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,170
I thought I knew he was talking about
nuclear energy.

84
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,830
Of the 2,000 scientists there,
I felt he was talking to me.

85
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,880
Of course, not true,

86
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,320
but in that twenty-minutes' talk,

87
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,690
my mind was made up.

88
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,760
I continued to like better
to work on pure science,

89
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,190
but this had to be done.

90
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,670
And as long as it had to be done,

91
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,890
and I could contribute, I did,

92
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,840
and was never sorry for having done it.

93
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,790
The uranium-gun weapon,
or "Little Boy" bomb,

94
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,100
was a simple design,

95
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,770
and scientists were confident
it would work without testing.

96
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,210
The "Fat Man," or implosion bomb,
was a more efficient design,

97
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,910
using plutonium instead of uranium.

98
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,790
Inside the very center of the bomb
was an initiator

99
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,410
surrounded by a sphere of plutonium.

100
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,230
This sphere was encased

101
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,920
within a set of symetrically-located,
high-explosive lenses

102
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,050
creating an implosion
which forced the plutonium

103
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,730
into itself, attaining critical mass.

104
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,260
The blast instantly raised temperatures
to 10 million degrees,

105
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,590
releasing a force of a
million pounds of pressure,

106
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,235
vaporizing the tower and all
desert life within half a mile.

107
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:32,270
The intensity of light was sufficient

108
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,390
to cause temporary blindness
to an observer ten miles away.

109
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,890
With a yield 200 times greater
than the hundred-ton test,

110
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:50,190
the fireball created a crater
nearly one half-mile across,

111
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,320
And fused the desert sand
into a green glass

112
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,590
still containing traces of radioactivity
fifty years later.

113
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,760
<i>Pearl Harbor plunged
the United States into war.</i>

114
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,900
<i>For three years, gathering
momentum with each small victory,</i>

115
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,140
<i>our forces had conducted an offensive</i>

116
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,690
<i>against the war-bloated
Empire of the Rising Sun.</i>

117
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,730
<i>Slowly, island by island,
mile by mile,</i>

118
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,820
<i>and then, with ever-quickening sweeps,
the combined land, sea, and air forces of the Allies</i>

119
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,690
<i>drove against the borders of that empire,</i>

120
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,890
<i>forcing it back, until late in 1945,</i>

121
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,770
<i>only the bastions of the Japanese
home islands remained to be stormed.</i>

122
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,950
<i>Ahead lay the greatest campaign of all:</i>

123
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,890
<i>invasion of Japanese homeland,
and close-in, desperate fighting.</i>

124
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,870
<i>That this fanatical enemy would not quit
until her last fighting man</i>

125
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,240
<i>had been driven from his cave and killed</i>

126
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,400
<i>had been established time and again
by bitter experience.</i>

127
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,300
The uranium-gun weapon, or "Little Boy" bomb,

128
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,720
was detonated over Hiroshima at
an altitude of 1,800 feet,

129
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,292
the height to achieve maximum blast effect.

130
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,300
Three days later, the "Fat Man"
implosion bomb

131
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,130
was detonated over Nagasaki.

132
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,471
In Hiroshima, 70,000 people were killed
or listed as missing.

133
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,675
Of its 90,000 buildings,
over 60,000 were demolished.

134
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,485
The implosion bomb dropped on
Nagasaki took the lives of 42,000 people,

135
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,353
and injured 40,000 more.

136
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,040
It destroyed 39% of all the
buildings in the city.

137
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,906
With a yield of 20 kilotons,
similar to that of Trinity,

138
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,500
this weapon would be considered
a nominal atomic bomb,

139
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,240
and provide a blueprint for all
future nuclear weapons.

140
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,700
But the principal targets are naval ships.

141
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:20,509
We are seeking primarily to learn

142
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:25,500
What types of ships, tactical formations,
and strategic dispositions

143
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:28,400
of our own naval forces
will best survive

144
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,200
attacks by atomic weapons,
should we ever have to face them.

145
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,250
Eleven months after the bombing
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

146
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,044
Operation Crossroads was conducted
at Bikini Atoll,

147
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,250
2,500 miles west of Hawaii.

148
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,690
The purpose of Crossroads

149
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,250
was to test the effects of atomic weapons
using two devices,

150
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,940
similar in design to Trinity and Nagasaki,

151
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,684
Code-named Able and Baker.

152
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,980
Shot Able to be dropped from a B-29,

153
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,550
while Shot Baker would be detonated
90 feet below the surface of the water.

154
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,280
The target armada consisted of 185

155
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,400
Japanese, German, and American ships,

156
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,950
ranging from small amphibious craft
to battleships and aircraft carriers.

157
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,250
The bomb will not start a chain reaction
in the water,

158
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,450
converting it all to gas,

159
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,680
and letting all the ships on all the oceans
drop down to the bottom.

160
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,100
It will not blow out the bottom of the sea

161
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,360
and let all the water run down the hole.

162
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,910
It will not destroy gravity.

163
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,750
I am not an "atomic playboy,"
as one of my critics labelled me,

164
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,550
exploding these bombs to satisfy
my personal whim.

165
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:20,800
Animals, plant life, even biological
warfare agents were assembled

166
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,700
to study the effects of heat,
blast, and radiation.

167
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,500
The bomb missed its intended target
by nearly 800 yards.

168
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
The blast sent five ships,
including two destroyers,

169
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,840
to the bottom of Bikini lagoon.

170
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,120
All ships within a half a mile of the blast
were heavily damaged.

171
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,040
But the damage was nowhere near that
created by the following

172
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,809
underwater blast, known as Shot Baker.

173
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:06,610
Five, four, three, two, one...
Fire.

174
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,845
<i>Bikini Baker was an underwater burst
of the same device,</i>

175
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:15,962
<i>and it produced much more damage
to the armada of seventy ships.</i>

176
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,792
<i>For instance, the USS Saratoga</i>

177
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,330
<i>had the bottom of it essentially
knocked out of it from the underwater burst.</i>

178
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,960
<i>The Saratoga sank and sets upright
at the bottom of the Bikini lagoon at the present time.</i>

179
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,200
I've often flown over Bikini lagoon,
and on clear days, when the water is quiet,

180
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,010
you can still see the Saratoga setting there.

181
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,700
The area surrounding Shot Baker

182
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,524
had become seriously radioactive,

183
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,620
and could not be safely
approached for some time.

184
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,550
This effect was not anticipated,

185
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,660
and ultimately led to a decision
by President Truman

186
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,190
to call off a third deep underwater test,
code-named Charlie.

187
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,710
<i>This is the mile-high city of
Los Alamos,</i>

188
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,292
<i>The Atomic City.</i>

189
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,980
<i>This is a modern pueblo, created by
the people of the United States</i>

190
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,960
<i>as a research and development center
for atomic weapons.</i>

191
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,680
<i>Since Eniwetok is a distant
and primitive area,</i>

192
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,500
<i>men have to leave their stateside
laboratories and homes</i>

193
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,270
<i>for a period running into months.</i>

194
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,840
<i>Since 1943, when
Los Alamos was established,</i>

195
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,720
<i>men from this mesa have left the
continental limits of the United States</i>

196
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,944
<i>to test the weapons they have created.</i>

197
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,780
Two years after Crossroads,

198
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,280
authority was given by President Truman

199
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,130
to proceed with Operation Sandstone.

200
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,520
While the purpose of Crossroads

201
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,260
had been to test the effects of atomic weapons,

202
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,640
Sandstone's objective was to test
new weapon designs.

203
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,730
Planning for such weapons had begun
many years earlier,

204
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,530
when the scientists on Trinity

205
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,290
had developed other experimental designs
for atomic weapons,

206
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,050
but were unsure of their success.

207
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:40,110
A joint task force was created
to head out once again to the Pacific,

208
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,230
and procure the islands of Eniwetok,
200 miles west of Bikini,

209
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,730
where Crossroads had been staged.

210
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,990
In early November, the first
construction crews arrived

211
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,250
to strip the islands of vegetation,

212
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,970
grade the land, and lay down
tar and asphalt for roads.

213
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,550
Within six months, construction crews
erected temporary housing

214
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:20,630
for many scientists and military personnel
required for Sandstone.

215
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,800
Perched atop 200-foot steel towers,

216
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,486
the three devices utilized on Sandstone
employed new technology

217
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:31,050
to double the explosive force of the bomb,

218
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,120
using the same amount of
plutonium spent over Nagasaki.

219
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,371
This technology met
Department of Defense requirements

220
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,250
for more efficient bombs

221
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,669
and increase the ability to
stockpile nuclear weapons.

222
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,570
Remote-controlled tanks,
guided by helicopter,

223
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,580
recovered fission samples
near Ground Zero,

224
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,450
to measure the intense
neutron and gamma radiation.

225
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,930
Radiochemical analysis of the
pulverized coral sand

226
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,800
would yield secrets about
the nuclear reaction,

227
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,670
and help in determining the efficiency of
the new bomb designs.

228
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,940
The results of Sandstone affected
the design of future nuclear weapons,

229
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,660
rendering the Mark III production components
of the Fat Man bomb obsolete.

230
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,320
The Mark IV and Mark V designs

231
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,437
brought improved performance and a
lighter weight to nuclear weapons.

232
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:29,790
Los Alamos National Laboratory Z Division

233
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,610
evolved into Sandia base,

234
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,260
located at Albuquerque, New Mexico's
Kirtland Air Force Base.

235
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,100
Sandia's primary purpose was to engineer

236
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:45,530
and manufacture deliverable
nuclear weapons, designed by Los Alamos.

237
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,470
In October of 1949,

238
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,760
Western Electric entered into a contract
with the Atomic Energy Commission,

239
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,430
on a no-profit, no-fee basis
to form the Sandia Corporation,

240
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:01,060
which assumed control of the base
from Los Alamos.

241
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,640
Sandia brought assembly-line techniques

242
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,450
and mass production to nuclear weapons,

243
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,950
to build the nation's stockpile of
tactical and strategic bombs.

244
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,810
<i>Upon his return from Bikini,
in public addresses,</i>

245
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:25,170
<i>in interviews, and in published articles,
Admiral Blandy</i>

246
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,292
<i>made recommendations of grave import
regarding the atomic bomb.</i>

247
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:34,820
It is essential that no country
gain ascendancy over the United States

248
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,900
in the development, manufacture, and
tactical use of atomic weapons.

249
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:54,820
On August 29, 1949, the Russians
detonated their first atomic bomb.

250
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,028
This event, coming five years earlier

251
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:59,270
than anyone in the West had predicted,

252
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,250
was largely the result of one man, Klaus Fuchs.

253
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,750
Fuchs, a Los Alamos physicist,
had passed detailed blueprints

254
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,690
of the original Trinity design
to the Russians.

255
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:14,450
With the emergence of the USSR
as a nuclear rival in 1949,

256
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,250
the United States believed it
had strong motivation

257
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,290
for intensifying its program of
nuclear testing.

258
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,340
<i>It was quite expensive and
a lot of logistics involved</i>

259
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,570
<i>in carrying out an operation
in the Pacific.</i>

260
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:32,160
So in January 1951, the United States
opened up the Nevada Proving Grounds,

261
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,320
which we now call the Nevada Test Site.

262
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,840
You know, this was about 60 miles
north of Las Vegas.

263
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:42,150
To check out the weapons for Greenhouse,

264
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,420
Operation Ranger was conducted,

265
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,850
in which five new nuclear weapon types

266
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,920
were air-dropped at that new test site.

267
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,130
With the confidence of those
new weapons in hand,

268
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:59,335
Operation Greenhouse proceeded
in the Spring of 1951.

269
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,730
Four shots were conducted on
Greenhouse.

270
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,470
One of the shots, Shot Easy,

271
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,140
was a Department of Defense
structural effects test.

272
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,510
<i>A 47-kiloton nuclear device on
a tower was used,</i>

273
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:19,310
<i>and it loaded many, many of the
structures that had been developed</i>

274
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:24,230
<i>for survivability in a
nuclear weapons environment.</i>

275
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:21,660
A fourth test on Operation Greenhouse
was the Item test.

276
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,270
About a 45-and-a-half-kiloton test

277
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:32,060
in which tritium was burned
in the very center of the nuclear explosion.

278
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:40,200
And this process of putting tritium at the
very center of the nuclear weapon is called "boosting."

279
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:47,250
And we kicked the yield up from about 20 kilotons
to 45 and a half kilotons,

280
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,571
more than doubling it by that process.

281
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:55,610
A very important feature in
expanding the stockpile

282
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,705
of nuclear weapons of the
United States at that time.

283
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,547
Another of the events on Greenhouse
was the George event.

284
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:56,040
<i>Now, George is a large, 225-kiloton weapon</i>

285
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,550
<i>that was used to burn a deuterium capsule.</i>

286
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:06,540
And this is the first of our thermonuclear
weapon experiments to ever be conducted.

287
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,570
Many people thought about it.
We discussed it a lot.

288
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:02,640
At the end of the war, most
people wanted to stop. I didn't.

289
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,860
Because here was more knowledge

290
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,260
in the coming uncertain period.

291
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,510
With a dangerous man like Stalin around

292
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,620
and our incomplete knowledge,

293
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:18,260
I felt that more knowledge is necessary.

294
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,950
Among the people who knew a great deal
about the hydrogen bomb,

295
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,000
I was the only advocate of it.

296
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,690
And that is, I think, my contribution.

297
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,520
Not that I invented it. Others would have.

298
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,510
And others in the Soviet Union did.

299
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:40,540
But I was the one person
who put knowledge,

300
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:45,680
and the availability of knowledge,
above everything else.

301
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,570
And I must say it appears that
that appealed to Truman,

302
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,110
<i>and he made the right decision.</i>

303
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,400
Welcome aboard the USS Estes.

304
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,340
As you may or may not know,
the Estes, here, is the command ship

305
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,865
of Joint Task Force 132.

306
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:15,520
We have minutes to go before
the first blast, Mike Shot,

307
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,580
of Operation Ivy.

308
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,680
59 minutes now, to be exact.

309
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,000
We've been here since daybreak.

310
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,340
Left Wetok last night, during the
early morning hours.

311
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,560
Now, as you can imagine,

312
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,990
feeling is running pretty high about now,

313
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,000
And there's reason for it.

314
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,470
If everything goes according to plan,

315
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,160
we'll soon see the largest explosion

316
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,410
ever set off on the face of the Earth.

317
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,340
<i>The test islands for Mike</i>

318
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,860
<i>are located at the top, or the
northern sector, of Eniwetok Atoll,</i>

319
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,420
<i>some 25 miles from Parry and Eniwetok,</i>

320
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,930
<i>the two base islands of this
atoll proving grounds.</i>

321
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,390
Three islands making up the test site

322
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,180
were linked together by causeways.

323
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,770
These connecting roads were built to
make it easy to get from island to island,

324
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,370
and to act as land platforms for
some of the instrumentation.

325
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:22,490
Situated on the Zero island was the cab,
or building, which housed the device.

326
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:26,460
The Mike device was known as a "wet bomb,"

327
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,080
because it used liquid hydrogen isotopes

328
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,416
to create the thermonuclear reaction.

329
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,860
This made the device very large,

330
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:39,130
weighing some 62 tons, and impractical
to use as a deliverable weapon.

331
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,480
A plywood tube ran from the Zero island,

332
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,100
across the causeways, to a detection station

333
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,680
on the farthest island, a distance
of nearly two miles.

334
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,130
This tube was filled with helium,

335
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,370
allowing lethal radioactive rays

336
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,890
faster travel to the detection station,

337
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,210
before the island was
consumed by the fireball.

338
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,910
You have a grandstand seat here

339
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,400
to one of the most momentous events
in the history of science.

340
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,460
In less than a minute you
see the most powerful explosion

341
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,000
ever witnessed by human eyes.

342
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,390
The blast will come out of the horizon,
just about there.

343
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:24,370
And this is the significance of the moment:

344
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:29,190
this is the first full-scale test
of a hydrogen device.

345
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:34,170
If the reaction goes, we're in
the Thermonuclear Era.

346
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:38,670
For the sake of all of us,
and for the sake of our country,

347
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,340
I know that you join me in wishing
this expedition well.

348
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,450
<i>It is now 30 seconds to Zero Time.</i>

349
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,210
<i>Put on goggles or turn away.</i>

350
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,950
<i>Do not remove goggles or face burst</i>

351
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,140
<i>until ten seconds after the first light.</i>

352
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,500
Minus 15 seconds.

353
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:17,407
Minus 10 seconds.

354
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:23,350
Niner, eight, seven, six, fiver...

355
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:28,360
four, three, two, one...

356
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,600
<i>2-6 approaching Ground Zero,</i>

357
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,260
<i>coming up on Bogon.</i>

358
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:43,330
<i>The detection station on Bogon
appears to be in good shape.</i>

359
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:46,220
<i>No visible sign of plywood tube.</i>

360
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,650
<i>All test islands seem to be swept clean.</i>

361
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,160
<i>Elugelab is completely gone.</i>

362
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,020
<i>Nothing there but water and
what appears to be a deep crater.</i>

363
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,840
In the spring of 1953,
the Atomic Energy Commission

364
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,610
and the Department of Defense conducted
eleven nuclear weapon tests in Nevada

365
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,823
under the code name Upshot-Knothole.

366
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:20,430
The objectives of Upshot-Knothole were to
test new nuclear devices,

367
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,560
improve battlefield tactics,

368
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,890
and to study the needs of civil defense
against a Soviet attack.

369
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:34,050
The first of the events, code-named Encore,
was a 27-kiloton nuclear device

370
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:37,400
air-dropped and detonated at
about 2,800 feet

371
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,630
<i>above a large blast line.</i>

372
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,940
The second Department of Defense burst,
called Grable,

373
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,970
was detonated at the same general area,

374
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:51,990
and it was delivered by the Army’s
new artillery cannon.

375
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:59,900
<i>A 280mm projectile was fired and detonated
over about the same blast area,</i>

376
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:06,540
with a yield of about 15 kilotons,
at an altitude of about 500 feet.

377
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:10,770
Now, the smaller yield,
15 kilotons at 500 feet,

378
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:14,040
produced a great deal more damage

379
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:20,070
than had the larger yield, Encore event,
27 kilotons at 2,800 feet.

380
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,180
And that's because the smaller yield
at the lower altitude

381
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,770
produced a very abnormal waveform
which we call a "precursor,"

382
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,731
<i>which is very stong, dynamic winds</i>

383
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,940
which, to drag-sensitive targets,
produces extensive damage.

384
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:41,630
For instance, a Jeep at a given level on Encore
may not have been damaged at all,

385
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:46,060
but on Grable, with a precursor loading,

386
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,330
<i>that Jeep would be completely
torn to pieces</i>

387
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:54,270
<i>and thrown down the blast line
distances like 500 feet.</i>

388
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,620
Well, there were many other peculiarities
to those two shots,

389
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,180
but it opened up a whole new vista

390
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,440
of "how do you use nuclear
weapons in a combat situation?"

391
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:44,360
<i>Common sense tells you
this is dangerous and foolish.</i>

392
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,590
<i>You wouldn't risk your neck in a trick like this.</i>

393
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:51,181
<i>Common sense tells us that being shot
out of a cannon is dangerous business.</i>

394
00:47:51,181 --> 00:47:53,780
<i>Common sense tells you not to
be careless at an airfield</i>

395
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,250
<i>with propellers and jet engines in action.</i>

396
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,000
<i>Handling dynamite - this, too,
looks dangerous.</i>

397
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,100
<i>But it's an everyday job for these men,</i>

398
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:04,060
<i>because they observe commonsense
safety precautions.</i>

399
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,010
<i>But sometimes we forget that security violations</i>

400
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,810
<i>can be dangerous business, too.</i>

401
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:12,869
<i>If classified information about this test mission
fell into enemy hands,</i>

402
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:15,470
<i>the consequences could be
disastrous to all of us,</i>

403
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:18,330
<i>individually and collectively as a nation.</i>

404
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,870
<i>Security is only common sense.</i>

405
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,337
<i>Don't take chances.</i>

406
00:48:22,337 --> 00:48:23,550
<i>Avoid loose talk.</i>

407
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,710
<i>Safeguard classified information.</i>

408
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,190
<i>Report security violations at once.</i>

409
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,250
<i>Prompt action may prevent a minor incident</i>

410
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,460
<i>from developing into a serious one.</i>

411
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,976
<i>Avoid writing about classified material
in letters home.</i>

412
00:48:35,976 --> 00:48:39,340
<i>Be sure you're secure!
Don't be careless!</i>

413
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,000
I hate a careless man!

414
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,180
Work on high-yield hydrogen bombs

415
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,960
had progressed from Operation Ivy,

416
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,310
culminating in the spring of 1954
with Castle Bravo:

417
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:02,270
the largest device ever detonated in
atmospheric testing by the United States.

418
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:08,008
Bravo was a hydrogen bomb
using solid thermonuclear fuel,

419
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:11,970
confirming the designs of
Edward Teller and Stan Ulam,

420
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:16,380
and paving the way to producing
aircraft-deliverable hydrogen bombs

421
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,770
and more effective weapons.

422
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,360
Significantly exceeding its expected yield
by two and a half times,

423
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,080
Castle Bravo, with an explosive power
of 15 megatons,

424
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,430
stripped islands clean of vegetation

425
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:57,880
and took the scientists by surprise.

426
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,180
The huge explosion released large
quantities of radioactive debris

427
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,050
into the atmosphere.

428
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:09,189
This resulted in the exposure and
contamination of some servicemen,

429
00:52:09,189 --> 00:52:11,640
natives, and the crew of a Japanese
fishing boat

430
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,550
which had gone unnoticed in the
security zone around the blast.

431
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,617
This incident pushed the dangers of fallout

432
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:23,280
from nuclear weapons clearly into
the public mind.

433
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,640
<i>Let's face it:</i>

434
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,030
<i>the threat of hydrogen bomb
warfare is the greatest danger</i>

435
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:16,110
<i>our nation has ever known.</i>

436
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:20,800
<i>Enemy jet bombers carrying nuclear
weapons can sweep over a variety</i>

437
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,510
<i>of routes and drop bombs on any
important target in the United States.</i>

438
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,330
<i>The threat of this destruction
has affected our way of life</i>

439
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:33,030
<i>in every city, town, and village
from coast to coast.</i>

440
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,608
<i>These are the signs of the times.</i>

441
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:44,749
<i>Only in practice now;
a rehearsal, a training exercise.</i>

442
00:53:44,749 --> 00:53:48,740
<i>But tomorrow, this siren may
mean the real thing.</i>

443
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,310
<i>And if you hear it,
as you drive in your auto,</i>

444
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:55,920
<i>as you sit in your office,
or work at your bank,</i>

445
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,980
<i>wherever you are,
what will you do?</i>

446
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:03,210
<i>What will happen to you?</i>

447
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,260
<i>Professor, let me tip your hat back
so we can get a good view of you</i>

448
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,860
<i>as I ask a very personal question:</i>

449
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,900
<i>How old are you?</i>

450
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,100
<i>My next birthday, I'll be 65,
sorry to say.</i>

451
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,750
That makes you the oldest,
and yet really the youngest,

452
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,380
from what we've observed here,

453
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,390
inhabitant of our trench,
so close to Ground Zero.

454
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,230
Arthur, there's a charming lady
right behind you.

455
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,510
Would you mind if we talked to her, too?

456
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,880
I'd like to get a little feminine reaction here, too.

457
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,328
This is Helen Leininger from New York City.

458
00:54:28,328 --> 00:54:30,530
Helen, how long have you been waiting now?

459
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:33,280
Oh, about eight days.

460
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,834
- Eight... nine days...
- Nine days, yes!

461
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:36,200
...if we do the calculation right.

462
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,213
<i>Well, Grant, I guess we'd better
get back up to Media Hill</i>

463
00:54:38,213 --> 00:54:41,030
and see what's going on,
and how close to H-Hour we really are.

464
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:46,770
Well, here on Media Hill, Roy, the big story
as far as we can determine from looking out there

465
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,348
is the Civil Defense story,

466
00:54:48,348 --> 00:54:51,980
as well as that story of the military
and the armored vehicles,

467
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,090
the tanks and the personnel carriers.

468
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,357
Now, Roy, once again, I want to
call you in so we can take a look

469
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,359
at our split-screen arrangement
that we have here,

470
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,810
not only our cameras here on Media Hill,

471
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:03,450
but the camera that you have
down in the trench,

472
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,160
so come in on that split screen.

473
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,020
In just a few seconds now, you'll
see me assume this position,

474
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,730
matter of fact, there's our cue now.

475
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,810
Everybody down, get down in the position

476
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,500
I'm going to shield my eyes
against flying debris.

477
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,560
Pull my helmet down on the nape of my neck

478
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,740
so that we don't get too many flying rocks.

479
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:22,930
All right. Good luck, Roy. Now let me
to explain something about this screen:

480
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:25,385
This screen, across the bottom
of the section that I am,

481
00:55:25,385 --> 00:55:29,120
will represent one mile on your camera.
The top part, two miles.

482
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,140
We're going to switch to another camera,
I'm going to move out of here...

483
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:36,920
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

484
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:43,403
<i>five, four, three,
two, one, zero.</i>

485
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:51,700
<i>The shock wave will arrive in the control point
area in approximately half a minute.</i>

486
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,752
Almost nine years had passed

487
00:56:50,752 --> 00:56:53,322
since the cancellation of the
deep underwater test

488
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:55,472
on Operation Crossroads.

489
00:56:55,792 --> 00:57:00,512
That test was finally conducted
as Operation Wigwam.

490
00:57:04,242 --> 00:57:07,772
500 miles off the coast
of San Diego, California,

491
00:57:07,772 --> 00:57:11,242
a 30-kiloton nuclear device
was suspended by a cable

492
00:57:11,242 --> 00:57:14,302
2,000 feet below an unmanned barge.

493
00:57:14,302 --> 00:57:16,862
A tow line, six miles long,

494
00:57:16,862 --> 00:57:19,332
stretched from the barge.

495
00:57:20,082 --> 00:57:21,802
Suspended from this tow line

496
00:57:21,802 --> 00:57:25,692
were three unmanned
submarines called "squaws."

497
00:57:29,299 --> 00:57:32,678
Cameras and instruments
were placed inside each sub

498
00:57:32,678 --> 00:57:35,772
to record the effects
of the nuclear detonation.

499
00:57:43,897 --> 00:57:45,902
The purpose of this operation

500
00:57:45,902 --> 00:57:49,236
was to determine the fatal range
of an enemy submarine

501
00:57:49,236 --> 00:57:52,382
to a deeply-detonated nuclear weapon.

502
00:58:00,142 --> 00:58:03,652
<i>25 seconds to Zero Time.</i>

503
00:58:09,006 --> 00:58:12,301
<i>20 seconds to Zero Time.</i>

504
00:58:20,726 --> 00:58:24,352
<i>15 seconds to Zero Time.</i>

505
00:58:27,842 --> 00:58:35,032
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

506
00:58:35,032 --> 00:58:42,872
<i>five, four, three, two, one...</i>

507
00:59:30,003 --> 00:59:33,840
Operation Redwing was conducted
in the Pacific,

508
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,232
primarily to test high-yield
thermonuclear devices.

509
00:59:40,992 --> 00:59:45,352
Seven months prior to Redwing,
the Soviet Union had demonstrated

510
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:47,842
the ability to deliver thermonuclear weapons

511
00:59:47,842 --> 00:59:49,342
by strategic bombers,

512
00:59:49,342 --> 00:59:52,234
tipping the balance of power in their favor.

513
00:59:52,482 --> 00:59:57,022
The Cherokee event would be the
first delivery by U.S. aircraft

514
00:59:57,022 --> 00:59:59,432
of a thermonuclear weapon.

515
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:04,622
This weapon would detonate with
a yield of three and a half megatons.

516
01:00:04,622 --> 01:00:08,708
Almost 200 times the power
the Trinity device.

517
01:00:47,942 --> 01:00:50,572
Cratering from high-yield detonations

518
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:54,532
was taking its toll on the Pacific test islands.

519
01:00:54,532 --> 01:00:58,182
Real estate at the Pacific proving grounds
was disappearing,

520
01:00:58,182 --> 01:00:59,942
and land was at a premium.

521
01:00:59,942 --> 01:01:04,282
Barges were increasingly employed
as a cheap form of transportation

522
01:01:04,282 --> 01:01:08,472
to carry thermonuclear bombs
out to sea for detonation.

523
01:01:28,192 --> 01:01:32,772
Many of these tests would document
an ever-growing concern.

524
01:01:39,242 --> 01:01:41,522
<i>One special phase of the study</i>

525
01:01:41,522 --> 01:01:45,092
<i>concerned the amount of radiation
that would pass through the human body.</i>

526
01:01:45,092 --> 01:01:48,072
<i>This required instrumentaion
in the stomach.</i>

527
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:51,602
<i>A small capsule was devised
as a film stack,</i>

528
01:01:51,602 --> 01:01:54,481
<i>with alternate bits
of film and spacers.</i>

529
01:01:55,742 --> 01:02:00,882
<i>Secured with a string and paraffin coated,
the capsule is swallowed.</i>

530
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:07,112
<i>One end of the string hangs out of the mouth,
so that the capsule can be retrieved</i>

531
01:02:07,112 --> 01:02:10,497
<i>after exposure, and the radiation measured.</i>

532
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:16,142
<i>Gamma radiation may do its damage
in either of two major ways,</i>

533
01:02:16,142 --> 01:02:17,822
<i>or both:</i>

534
01:02:17,822 --> 01:02:20,712
<i>One, it may physically and directly
destroy tissue,</i>

535
01:02:20,712 --> 01:02:23,732
<i>or eventually cause the
development of some kind of cancers.</i>

536
01:02:23,732 --> 01:02:27,142
Those which concern us principally
have life periods

537
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:29,637
ranging from several years
to thousands of years.

538
01:02:29,637 --> 01:02:32,882
They can do no harm,
unless they are taken into our bodies

539
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,742
with food or drinking water,
or in the air we breathe.

540
01:02:35,742 --> 01:02:39,317
<i>Let us consider the results of a
powerful thermonuclear explosion</i>

541
01:02:39,317 --> 01:02:42,529
<i>at the Pacific proving grounds
in the Marshall Islands,</i>

542
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:44,582
<i>11 degrees north of the Equator.</i>

543
01:02:44,582 --> 01:02:48,222
<i>The huge cloud soars up, punches
through the tropopause,</i>

544
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:53,362
<i>and finally spreads and stabilizes
as high as 70 or 80 thousand feet,</i>

545
01:02:53,362 --> 01:02:55,842
<i>entirely within the stratosphere layer.</i>

546
01:02:55,842 --> 01:03:00,512
<i>This brings us to the most widely discussed
fission product, strontium-90.</i>

547
01:03:00,512 --> 01:03:04,842
Chemically similar to the soil calcium <i>
with which it becomes mixed,</i>

548
01:03:04,842 --> 01:03:08,482
<i>the strontium-90 follows calcium
through its regular cycles,</i>

549
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:09,598
<i>into our plant foods,</i>

550
01:03:09,598 --> 01:03:12,842
<i>and into the bones, meat, and milk
of our plant-eating animals.</i>

551
01:03:12,842 --> 01:03:16,892
<i>Reaching our own bodies,
the strontium-90, like calcium,</i>

552
01:03:16,892 --> 01:03:19,572
<i>tends to be concentrated in our bones,</i>

553
01:03:19,572 --> 01:03:22,382
<i>particularly those of children
who are building new bone.</i>

554
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:26,642
<i>The radiation from strontium-90 has
extremely short range in the body,</i>

555
01:03:26,642 --> 01:03:29,622
<i>so it causes no genetic threat
to the reproductive cells.</i>

556
01:03:29,622 --> 01:03:33,062
<i>It does pose a threat to
the bone marrow, and the bone itself,</i>

557
01:03:33,062 --> 01:03:36,462
<i>in the form of either
leukemia or bone cancer.</i>

558
01:03:40,802 --> 01:03:46,682
If this should happen, it would be a tragic thing
for those injured, no matter how small the number.

559
01:03:46,682 --> 01:03:51,042
Whether these statistically very few
casualties can be justified

560
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:54,522
is a personal value judgment
outside the scope of this report.

561
01:03:54,522 --> 01:03:58,605
Each citizen must make his or her
own evaluation.

562
01:03:58,852 --> 01:04:01,362
There are those few who loudly maintain

563
01:04:01,362 --> 01:04:03,972
that there is no actual threat to
the free world at all,

564
01:04:03,972 --> 01:04:08,615
certainly none that can justify either
nuclear testing or nuclear armament.

565
01:04:08,615 --> 01:04:12,152
The opposite viewpoint holds that the
development of our nuclear power

566
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:14,122
has been an absolutely necessary protection

567
01:04:14,122 --> 01:04:17,072
against Communist hostility
and nuclear threats.

568
01:04:17,072 --> 01:04:20,962
In this view, the fallout casualties, if any,

569
01:04:20,962 --> 01:04:24,302
will be seen as those of unidentified soldiers

570
01:04:24,302 --> 01:04:26,042
in the service of humanity,

571
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:29,636
unknown soldiers in a war which
has not struck,

572
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:33,672
and which our nuclear power may indeed
prevent from ever striking.

573
01:04:34,632 --> 01:04:40,062
In the fall of 1957, with test moratoriums
looming on the horizon,

574
01:04:40,062 --> 01:04:43,942
24 nuclear tests were
conducted in the Nevada desert,

575
01:04:43,942 --> 01:04:47,092
under the code name
Operation Plumbbob.

576
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:51,222
During Plumbbob, the Hood event
would become the largest test

577
01:04:51,222 --> 01:04:55,662
ever conducted in the atmosphere
within the continental United States.

578
01:04:55,662 --> 01:04:58,752
Hood, a 74-kiloton device,

579
01:04:58,752 --> 01:05:03,169
was suspended 1,500 feet above
the desert floor on a balloon.

580
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:12,432
While new weapon designs
continued to be tested,

581
01:05:12,432 --> 01:05:15,012
the Department of Defense used the series

582
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:18,226
to accelerate military training
in nuclear warfare,

583
01:05:18,226 --> 01:05:22,752
while continuing its study of the
effects from nuclear explosions.

584
01:07:54,799 --> 01:08:00,597
The 21st test conducted during Operation
Plumbbob was "The Rainier Event."

585
01:08:00,752 --> 01:08:07,272
This was the first fully-contained underground nuclear
weapon detonation conducted by the United States.

586
01:08:07,272 --> 01:08:12,742
The 3-kiloton device was detonated
790 feet below Rainier Mesa,

587
01:08:12,742 --> 01:08:17,155
vaporizing rock into a molten bubble
100 feet wide.

588
01:08:17,155 --> 01:08:21,612
This technology would have great importance
after the Limited Test Ban Treaty,

589
01:08:21,612 --> 01:08:25,272
which would prohibit all but underground
testing of nuclear weapons,

590
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:29,392
and hide future experiments
from prying eyes.

591
01:08:41,712 --> 01:08:46,872
During Operation Hardtack, the United States
detonated 35 nuclear devices,

592
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:50,897
as many as had been fired
in all prior Pacific tests.

593
01:08:53,322 --> 01:08:57,192
By now, nuclear weapon tests
were perceived, in large part,

594
01:08:57,192 --> 01:08:58,905
as saber-rattling,

595
01:08:58,905 --> 01:09:00,907
increasing the international tensions

596
01:09:00,907 --> 01:09:04,252
that could lead to all-out nuclear war.

597
01:09:12,972 --> 01:09:14,712
Against mounting pressure,

598
01:09:14,712 --> 01:09:18,372
the United States government still
believed that the weapons were vital,

599
01:09:18,372 --> 01:09:23,472
and were the only counterweight to
offset superior Soviet manpower.

600
01:09:23,472 --> 01:09:28,476
The Soviets, having just completed an
elaborate series of atmospheric tests,

601
01:09:28,476 --> 01:09:32,982
were now likely to make a move
to renounce testing,

602
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:36,317
knowing full well that the U.S.
was involved in a massive operation.

603
01:09:37,822 --> 01:09:42,202
And operations were conducted at
Eniwetok and Bikini, as we had before,

604
01:09:42,202 --> 01:09:47,122
and a new operational site was brought
in under Operation Hardtack,

605
01:09:47,122 --> 01:09:49,664
And that was the Johnston Island operations.

606
01:09:49,664 --> 01:09:55,052
During the tests, one of the events of
some significance is the Cactus event.

607
01:09:55,052 --> 01:09:58,382
<i>This was a little 18-kiloton
device that produced </i>

608
01:09:58,382 --> 01:10:03,072
<i>a crater about 137 feet across
and 37 feet deep.</i>

609
01:10:03,072 --> 01:10:07,332
<i>Many years later, in 1980,
all of the fission debris</i>

610
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:11,392
<i>and radioactive material on Eniwetok Atoll</i>

611
01:10:11,392 --> 01:10:15,132
<i>was gathered up and dumped
into the Cactus crater,</i>

612
01:10:15,132 --> 01:10:19,022
<i>and then a concrete dome was
placed over the crater</i>

613
01:10:19,022 --> 01:10:23,281
<i>to keep and stabilize the radioactive
material that had been contained in it.</i>

614
01:10:23,522 --> 01:10:25,162
A year before Hardtack,

615
01:10:25,162 --> 01:10:29,245
the Soviets launched a small
satellite named Sputnik 1.

616
01:10:29,412 --> 01:10:32,290
Concerned by the superiority
of Soviet rockets,

617
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,992
the United States conducted its
first two missile-borne,

618
01:10:34,992 --> 01:10:36,892
high altitude detonations,

619
01:10:36,892 --> 01:10:39,152
known as Teak and Orange.

620
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,452
The nuclear weapons for Teak and Orange

621
01:10:41,452 --> 01:10:44,594
were carried aloft into space
by the Redstone missile,

622
01:10:44,594 --> 01:10:47,042
developed by Wernher von Braun.

623
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:49,112
Von Braun and his crew had developed

624
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:51,992
the V-2 rocket for Germany
during World War II.

625
01:10:51,992 --> 01:10:54,802
The Redstone was considered
an extension

626
01:10:54,802 --> 01:10:57,023
of this World War II technology

627
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:58,812
and had a limited range.

628
01:10:59,352 --> 01:11:01,861
Utilizing liquid oxygen for fuel,

629
01:11:01,861 --> 01:11:06,912
The Redstone would propel its nuclear cargo
into the Earth's upper atmosphere

630
01:11:06,912 --> 01:11:09,812
and release it for detonation.

631
01:12:32,472 --> 01:12:36,122
Teak, with a yield of 3.8 megatons,

632
01:12:36,122 --> 01:12:39,992
detonated nearly 50 miles
above the surface of the Earth.

633
01:12:40,362 --> 01:12:44,922
The explosion created a violent magnetic
disturbance in the atmosphere,

634
01:12:44,922 --> 01:12:48,762
known as EMP, or Electromagnetic Pulse.

635
01:12:48,762 --> 01:12:53,362
This phenomenon silenced radio
transmissions for nearly eight hours,

636
01:12:53,362 --> 01:12:57,560
and damaged electrical circuits
from Hawaii to New Zealand.

637
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:05,302
Immediately following shots
Teak and Orange in the Pacific

638
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:08,882
the United States conducted
Operation Argus:

639
01:13:08,882 --> 01:13:13,322
Three 1-kiloton missile-borne tests
in the South Atlantic.

640
01:13:19,242 --> 01:13:24,152
The Argus experiment sought
to create and explore

641
01:13:24,152 --> 01:13:26,714
trapped bomb radiation in
the Earth's Van Allen belts.

642
01:13:27,172 --> 01:13:30,222
Detonating 300 miles above the Earth,

643
01:13:30,222 --> 01:13:33,722
the experiment sought to create
a radioactive shield

644
01:13:33,722 --> 01:13:37,492
to impede the performance of a
Soviet missile attack.

645
01:13:48,945 --> 01:13:52,872
<i>These pictures, enlarged from 16mm
for your theater screen,</i>

646
01:13:52,872 --> 01:13:53,572
<i>are the first to show the hand-raising

<i>These pictures, enlarged from 16mm

648
01:13:56,962 --> 01:13:59,372
<i>for it marks the approval by

649
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:02,392
<i>of Nikita Khrushchev's rise
to the Premiership,</i>

650
01:14:02,392 --> 01:14:04,902
<i>and power that was once Stalin's.</i>

651
01:14:04,902 --> 01:14:07,982
<i>The free world awaits the
obvious diplomatic thrusts,</i>

652
01:14:07,982 --> 01:14:10,312
<i>the first coming barely
four days later.</i>

653
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:13,678
<i>Russia announces it is
suspending further nuclear tests,</i>

654
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:18,052
<i>a statement which the U.S.
brands a propaganda maneuver.</i>

655
01:14:19,442 --> 01:14:22,032
The United States is prepared,

656
01:14:22,032 --> 01:14:25,912
unless testing is resumed
by the Soviet Union,

657
01:14:25,912 --> 01:14:31,862
to withhold further testing, on its part,
of atomic and hydrogen weapons

658
01:14:31,862 --> 01:14:37,352
for a period of one year from
the beginning of the negotiations.

659
01:14:50,172 --> 01:14:54,452
For two years, an uneasy moratorium
on weapon testing

660
01:14:54,452 --> 01:14:58,282
continued between the United States
and the Soviet Union.

661
01:15:01,132 --> 01:15:04,152
Secretly, the Soviets began designing

662
01:15:04,152 --> 01:15:06,492
new weapons of mass destruction,

663
01:15:06,492 --> 01:15:09,782
including a 57-megaton hydrogen bomb,

664
01:15:09,782 --> 01:15:13,672
the largest nuclear weapon ever built.

665
01:15:23,672 --> 01:15:27,062
This monster bomb was a
scaled-down version

666
01:15:27,062 --> 01:15:29,412
of a 100-megaton design,

667
01:15:29,412 --> 01:15:33,012
and was aircraft-deliverable.

668
01:16:25,172 --> 01:16:29,482
As he said he would, Mr. Khrushchev
has exploded his giant bomb,

669
01:16:29,482 --> 01:16:32,472
in cynical disregard of the United Nations.

670
01:16:34,572 --> 01:16:38,972
By this act, the Soviet Union
had added injury to insult.

671
01:16:38,972 --> 01:16:43,432
They broke the moratorium
on nuclear weapons testing.

672
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:47,322
They have raised atmospheric pollution
to new heights.

673
01:16:47,322 --> 01:16:52,872
They have started a new race,
for more deadly weapons.

674
01:16:53,292 --> 01:16:57,383
They have spurned the humanitarian
appeal of the United Nations

675
01:16:57,383 --> 01:17:00,162
and of all peace-loving peoples.

676
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:03,389
They have advanced no solid justification

677
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:08,702
for exploding this monstrous
and unnecessary weapon.

678
01:17:08,702 --> 01:17:11,502
They have been wholly unmoved

679
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:15,992
by the dangers of radioactive
fallout to the human race.

680
01:17:15,992 --> 01:17:20,672
The United States delegation deeply deplores

681
01:17:20,672 --> 01:17:24,262
this contempt for world opinion.

682
01:17:24,262 --> 01:17:29,602
And we think that, in the light of this
somber development,

683
01:17:29,602 --> 01:17:33,702
other delegations may wish to
express their views

684
01:17:33,702 --> 01:17:37,870
on this shocking and distressing news.

685
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:44,032
For today, Mr. Chairman, the world has taken
a great leap backward

686
01:17:44,032 --> 01:17:46,742
toward anarchy and disaster.

687
01:17:46,742 --> 01:17:50,852
The Russians had shattered
the voluntary moratorium.

688
01:17:50,852 --> 01:17:53,582
The United States would soon follow suit,

689
01:17:53,582 --> 01:17:58,282
with an extensive series of weapon tests
for massive retaliation.

690
01:18:11,472 --> 01:18:16,132
Tensions mounted, as nearly
100 nuclear tests were conducted

691
01:18:16,132 --> 01:18:19,722
between the Nevada test site
and the Pacific Ocean,

692
01:18:19,722 --> 01:18:24,842
under the code names
Nougat, Storax, and Dominic.

693
01:18:52,472 --> 01:18:55,332
Of primary importance were the uncertainties

694
01:18:55,332 --> 01:18:58,262
of offensive and defensive weapons systems

695
01:18:58,262 --> 01:19:02,742
in place, but unproven, since
the beginning of the voluntary moratorium.

696
01:19:24,072 --> 01:19:27,682
Operations resumed on Johnston Island
and Christmas Island

697
01:19:27,682 --> 01:19:30,286
during Operation Dominic.

698
01:19:30,286 --> 01:19:34,372
The United States negotiated the use
of Christmas Island from the British,

699
01:19:34,372 --> 01:19:38,532
who had used the island to conduct
their own thermonuclear tests.

700
01:19:40,112 --> 01:19:45,772
Multi-megaton nuclear weapons were loaded
aboard B-52 strategic bomber aircraft,

701
01:19:45,772 --> 01:19:51,307
delivered from Hawaii, and air-dropped
off the south end of Christmas Island.

702
01:22:02,172 --> 01:22:05,752
The Department of Defense continued
its advance into space

703
01:22:05,752 --> 01:22:10,272
by conducting five high-altitude
tests above Johnston Island.

704
01:22:10,272 --> 01:22:15,152
Most of these bombs were carried aloft
by the Air Force's Thor missile,

705
01:22:15,152 --> 01:22:16,892
to continue the research

706
01:22:16,892 --> 01:22:21,707
of neutralizing incoming enemy warheads
high above the Earth.

707
01:22:22,562 --> 01:22:27,462
Nuclear weapon testing
had joined the space age.

708
01:25:12,272 --> 01:25:15,952
This small step towards safety
can be followed by others,

709
01:25:15,952 --> 01:25:17,952
longer and less limited,

710
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,682
if also harder in the taking.

711
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:24,132
With our courage and understanding
enlarged by this achievement,

712
01:25:24,132 --> 01:25:29,742
let us press onward in quest of
man's essential desire for peace.

713
01:25:29,742 --> 01:25:33,802
As president of the United States, and
with the advice and consent of the Senate,

714
01:25:33,802 --> 01:25:38,252
I now sign the instruments
of ratification of this treaty.

715
01:25:38,252 --> 01:25:47,172
<i>Tightrope was the last atmospheric
test ever conducted by the United States.</i>

716
01:25:47,172 --> 01:25:49,502
<i>And it was fired from Johnston Island</i>

717
01:25:49,502 --> 01:25:52,852
in the Nike-Hercules air defense missile

718
01:25:52,852 --> 01:25:57,152
and detonated, again,
well above Johnston Island.

719
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:02,862
And that ended this whole series of
atmospheric testing by the United States,

720
01:26:02,862 --> 01:26:09,322
when, in 1963 we entered the
Limited Test Ban Treaty,

721
01:26:09,322 --> 01:26:14,232
that prohibits any atmospheric testing.

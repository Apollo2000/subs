00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,434
"In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread...

3
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,436
till thou return unto the ground,

4
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,689
for out of it was thou taken,
for dust thou art,

5
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,567
and unto dust shalt thou return.

6
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,819
And Adam called his wife's name Eve,

7
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,447
because she was the mother of all living.

8
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,782
- Unto Adam, also and unto his wife...
- Wish we had eggs.

9
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,786
did the Lord God make coats of skins
and clothed them.

10
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,789
- And the Lord God said, 'Behold,
- Behold, I don't remember what eggs are.

11
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,792
the man is become as one of us,
to know good and evil,

12
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,379
and now, lest he put forth his hand
and also take,

13
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:49,384
and take also of the tree of life,
and eat, and live forever.'

14
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,513
Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth
from the Garden of Eden,

15
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,808
to till the ground
from whence that he was taken.

16
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:01,521
So he drove out the man and he placed him
at the east of the Garden of Eden,

17
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,358
cherubim and a flaming sword
which turned every way,

18
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,736
to keep the way of the tree of life."

19
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,118
Step up.

20
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,869
William!

21
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,498
William.

22
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,543
William. William.

23
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,846
He managed to hightail it in there
just as fast as he could.

24
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,848
Figured he'd wait out the storm.

25
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,850
But when he got inside,

26
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:06,605
it turned out there was a big ol'
grizzly bear sleeping in there!

27
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,358
Joe faced himself a dilemma.

28
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,612
Sure death outside...

29
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,114
and sure death inside.

30
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,743
- Well, what did he do?
- Ol' Joe, he took the quicker route.

31
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,746
He pulled out his gun,
he took a shot at the bear,

32
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,456
but it just made him mad!

33
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,627
She come at him,
claws a-swipin' and teeth a-snappin',

34
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,047
and somehow- somehow
Joe managed to get himself...

35
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,257
up on the back side of the bear,

36
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,053
and he rolled around the cave
like a buckin' bull!

37
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,640
And she took his scalp clean off...

38
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,808
on the roof of the cave that day.

39
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,727
But you know what?

40
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,107
He ate her in the end.

41
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,820
And ever since then...

42
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,490
he's worn his hair long.

43
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,242
- You know why?
- No.

44
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,662
In deference to the squeamish.

45
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,207
It was quite a fight, son.
It was quite a fight.

46
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,876
But there's no bears here!

47
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,087
Hell's full of bears, Jimmy.

48
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,423
But there's no bears here.

49
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,449
What are they talking about?

50
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,285
Were you told?

51
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,787
Your husband didn't say?

52
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,706
Not this time.

53
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,962
They're talking about
whether to hang Stephen Meek.

54
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,155
<i>Gately argued that Meek...</i>

55
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,617
<i>has taken us off track on purpose,</i>

56
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,827
<i>that he was hired...</i>

57
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,622
<i>to get rid of American immigrants.</i>

58
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,875
So the more of us come,
the more likely the territory goes American.

59
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,668
It has a logic.

60
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,047
I suppose.

61
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,009
A broken one.

62
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,471
Mr. White wasn't swayed either.
He argued for more patience.

63
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,641
"We're at the man's mercy now,"
he said.

64
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:35,063
"Meek's just made a mistake is all.
He's just in over his head."

65
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,318
And then what?

66
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,655
We were just getting into it again
when Meek himself showed up.

67
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,825
He'd been hiding above us
up there in the rocks the whole time.

68
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,493
So that's where he was.

69
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,496
He strutted into the circle
with his gun in his hand.

70
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,916
"Well, you've found me," he said.
"Now go ahead with the killin'."

71
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,170
Everybody got real quiet.
It shut everybody up.

72
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:03,675
Frank Gately is happy enough to hang a man
so long as he's not around.

73
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,599
And?

74
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,686
Well, Meek got to talkin'.

75
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,479
Of course he did.

76
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,526
He says that we are in Paiute country now.

77
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,280
He says that the Paiutes
are a fearsome tribe,

78
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,658
that they're nothing like the Flatheads
on the main stem.

79
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,619
If we trust him to do his job,

80
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,582
well, then he welcomed anyone
to gainsay him.

81
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,171
- Nothing about our route.
- Nothing about it.

82
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,967
"Seen the elephant," my eye.

83
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,761
Two weeks, he said,
and we'd be in the pass.

84
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,765
It's been over five and we haven't
even seen a mountain yet.

85
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,396
What was the verdict?

86
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,481
We give a few more days.

87
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,780
We never should have left
the main stem.

88
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,381
- Good morning, Emily.
- Morning.

89
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,314
Workin' like niggers once again.

90
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,721
Maybe we're back on known ground.

91
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,600
Oh, he was guessing.

92
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,561
Everyone has some luck sometimes.

93
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,128
Hyah.

94
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,066
Come on.

95
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,114
Made 10 miles today.

96
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,867
I'd say this is the best shelter
we've had since morning.

97
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,578
The wind's not gonna be kind tonight.

98
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,164
It's early yet.

99
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,500
We won't push too hard.

100
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,630
I say we keep on.

101
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,216
The going is easy in these parts,

102
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,261
and we should make the most of this ground
while we can.

103
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,429
Seems to be more shelter up ahead.

104
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,766
Well, I'd be careful now.

105
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,768
This country'll play tricks on you.

106
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,147
That piece you see out there might be-

107
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,482
A whole lot farther than you think.

108
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,817
Guarantee it.

109
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,695
How far would you say?

110
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,782
I wouldn't say.
I just know it'll be farther than I think.

111
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:24,453
The thinness of the air
makes everything look closer than it is.

112
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,581
There could be water though?

113
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,335
Yeah. Possible, I reckon.

114
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,589
I say we keep on.

115
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,176
I think I would agree.

116
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,265
All right. Keep moving.

117
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,478
Hyah.

118
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,621
Hyah.

119
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,306
Hyah.

120
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,636
Come ho.

121
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,883
Well, we'll have to water the animals
from our own supply tonight.

122
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,722
Can't go without after a day like this.

123
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,771
Should've taken on more at the river.

124
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,829
You need to eat.
You've been working all day.

125
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,415
I'm fine for now. Please.

126
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,167
Evenin'.

127
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,712
- Good evening, Mrs. Tetherow.
- Mr. White.

128
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,633
Uh, Glory, I brought some bread to share.

129
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,552
That's much appreciated, Emily.

130
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,554
It's my pleasure.

131
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,057
I-I-I have stew too,
if you'd like it.

132
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,226
I know you would.

133
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,228
No.

134
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,730
No, this is enough.
Thank you.

135
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,315
Jimmy.

136
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,158
It's like my feet have gloves,

137
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,912
like I can- I can handle
the ground that I'm walking on.

138
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,748
I feel the sand. I feel the dirt.
I feel the gravel.

139
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,751
I never slip. I never-
I don't- I never stumble.

140
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,547
I can follow a trail in the dark
and never stray off the path.

141
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,758
I live with this world.
I'm not just in it, is what I'm sayin'.

142
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,679
But to answer your question,
Gately, the beaver, they're played out.

143
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,266
That's the truth.
That market's done and gone.

144
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,019
There's no fortune to be had there anymore.
Your man Astor got it all.

145
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,106
We should have made the trip earlier.
Waited too long.

146
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,109
No, you know, there-
there are plenty of fortunes to be had.

147
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:10,448
I mean, the beaver, that's a- that's just
the first gift of this land. You mark my words.

148
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,285
Will the territory go American?
That's what I want to know.

149
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,954
Well, in my- in my opinion, I-

150
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,956
Well, you know, it depends.

151
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,792
It depends on the fight...
in the Americans,

152
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,795
and in the English,
and in the Indians.

153
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,175
I'm led to believe there's 250 Americans
in Oregon country.

154
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:33,137
There's seven more argonauts comin' in a few weeks.
Maybe that'll tip the scales.

155
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,222
Where would you settle?

156
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,350
Willamette Valley.

157
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,020
That's where my brother Joe
put down stakes.

158
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,022
Civilization is taking hold there.

159
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,483
They got missionaries in Champoeg.

160
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,152
Could have found God in Virginia.

161
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,155
Well, if it's riches you're after,
there's riches aplenty.

162
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,158
The land you're headed for
is a regular second Eden.

163
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,160
You won't want for riches someday.

164
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,996
You'll just plunge your hands
into the ground.

165
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,174
Come to bed.

166
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,926
Soon.

167
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,814
That was my mother's.

168
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,441
I know.

169
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,112
It's only weight now.

170
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,407
Jimmy!

171
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,163
He's gone. I'm telling you.

172
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:08,417
He's abandoned us. He'll move faster alone.
It's what I'd do.

173
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,502
No, it's not what you'd do.

174
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,381
He saw the writing.

175
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,302
How much water you reckon?

176
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,012
Two days, maybe three.

177
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,432
Ah. He's gone by now.

178
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,225
He's gone by now.

179
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,523
There we are.

180
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,828
- Water!
- Amen.

181
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,413
Water ahead!

182
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,486
It's alkaline!

183
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,573
It's alkaline.

184
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,492
Whoa. Whoa.

185
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,710
It's alkaline.

186
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,053
Can't water here.

187
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,139
Not even the animals.

188
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,350
Well, then?

189
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,270
What now?

190
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,522
Well, we skirt around.

191
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,276
Go south till we make it around.

192
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,319
How far is it around?

193
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,155
Well, we'll find out.

194
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,408
Shouldn't be too far.
The maps I've seen don't record much of this.

195
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,994
Oh.

196
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,876
No.

197
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,128
We're not going farther south.

198
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,009
Well, we can't keep west
unless you brought oars.

199
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,845
We're heading north.

200
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,683
Meet back with the main stem
if we have to.

201
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,521
There's scarce grass and water up north.

202
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,190
South is the best bet.

203
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,193
Well, there's nothing
where we came from either,

204
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,488
and there's nothing ahead,
so I'm saying north.

205
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,490
We'll move closer to the Columbia.

206
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,742
That way we can rejoin the communication.

207
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,286
I- I see your thinking.

208
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,874
How many days to the Columbia
from hereabouts?

209
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,501
Well, too many.

210
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,547
West is the goal.
The sooner we get moving west, the better.

211
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,425
The quickest way west,
by my reckoning-

212
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,177
south.

213
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,893
Mr. Gately, do you have an opinion?

214
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,861
I think north too.

215
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,656
Well, I'm advising against that.

216
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,659
Now, I've been all through this country,
more or less.

217
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,912
By God, you contracted me to get you
to the Valley. I will.

218
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,540
We understand that, Mr. Meek.
We understand.

219
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:38,836
But you work for us, Mr. Meek.
You'll be paid.

220
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,423
Just, uh, we're not going around.
We're going north.

221
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:47,219
Suit yourselves.

222
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,266
We'll do what we do.

223
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,777
Two shots if we find water.

224
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,201
Hyah!

225
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,582
Mrs. Tetherow, look what we found!

226
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,460
What is it, Emily?

227
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,969
Jimmy.

228
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,771
So he wore clothes?

229
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,899
Yes.

230
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,359
Yes, some.

231
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,528
Paint on his face?

232
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,865
- No.
- Horse?

233
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,324
Uh, yes.

234
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,577
Was he carryin' a weapon?
A knife or a bow?

235
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,788
Uh... no.

236
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,790
No, I don't think so.

237
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,918
I'm not sure. I was upset.

238
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,671
He-He had a- a scar
on his shoulder though.

239
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,883
Well, if he wore clothes,
he's no Digger.

240
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,551
They're hardly more than animals.

241
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,721
- We're too far south for that anyway.
- Might be Paiute.

242
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,347
Could be Nez Perce.

243
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,353
He could be Cayuse.
They're from the north.

244
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,356
It's far west for Blackfoot,
but that's possible.

245
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,026
And what does that mean?

246
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,488
Jimmy, go help your mother.

247
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,574
Well, frankly, I'm amazed.

248
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,660
Mrs. Tetherow saw this redskin
and lived to tell the tale.

249
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:45,123
I mean, you rarely see
hide nor hair of a hostile...

250
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,001
till he just jumps you
and cuts your throat.

251
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,045
They can disappear
in their own shadow.

252
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:54,925
They can hide under a wolf skin so quiet,
you step on 'em before you know it.

253
00:34:55,009 --> 00:35:00,847
And where one redskin is,
there's a dozen more just lurkin' nearby.

254
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,266
And they're all armed by now.

255
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,686
And sometimes...

256
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,565
I mean, sometimes they wait till they're fired on,
but most of them they don't.

257
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,692
When they come on a woman,

258
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,904
they kill her.

259
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:19,825
I mean, they'd never dream
of sparin' a woman.

260
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,037
So I'm guessin' it's Cayuse.

261
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,622
On a horse this far north.

262
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:30,127
I mean, they roam all over the basin here,
all the way down to Mexico.

263
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,588
They pick up slaves from the Klamaths.
They sell' em at Celilo.

264
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,258
We'll find out presently, I reckon.

265
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,051
No fires tonight.

266
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,638
And double watch.

267
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,640
- Dandy.
- Mercy.

268
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,642
Hell's full of Indians, my friends.

269
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,727
You were lucky tonight, ma'am.

270
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,898
Don't want a blanket.

271
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,611
Don't make it worse.

272
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,490
Cold is the least of my troubles.

273
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,325
Hmm.

274
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,121
It's only a few days north
to the Columbia by my reckoning.

275
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,789
I been keepin' notes.

276
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,459
- What if we don't find water soon?
- We will.

277
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,420
Your optimism.

278
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,303
I'm sorry.

279
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,521
Is he ignorant,

280
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,524
or is he just plain evil?

281
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,152
That's my quandary.
It's impossible to know.

282
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,529
We can't know.

283
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,948
That's very comforting, Mr. Tetherow.

284
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,876
Well,

285
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,419
we made our decision.

286
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,422
This is all gonna be a bad dream soon.

287
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,674
It's gonna be a story to tell.

288
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,890
I don't blame him for not knowing.

289
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,434
I blame him for saying he did.

290
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,479
That fool.

291
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,527
Solomon?

292
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,695
- Dry breakfast?
- No.

293
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,907
Might as well eat the dust.

294
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,660
Ladies.

295
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,287
Fine morning.

296
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,622
I'd like to know how.

297
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:17,627
Well, not too hot. Plus smooth ground.
Could be a piece worse.

298
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,714
It's not today that's weighing on me.

299
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,304
We'll follow the land downhill.

300
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:31,891
- The water's more likely in the lower places.
- That's fine.

301
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,606
Heed. Stay with us.

302
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,417
Broken axle.

303
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,271
- I'm gonna bring this wheel off.
- All right.

304
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,543
Are those our mountains, Mr. Meek?

305
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,171
Oh, no. No, no.

306
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,548
We'll know our mountains, Jimmy.

307
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,134
Hell's full of mountains.
Those aren't them.

308
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,387
What are they?

309
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,389
Well, they...

310
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,724
They're nameless, I suppose.

311
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,021
We'll call 'em Jimmy's Mountains.
What do you say to that?

312
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,981
- I suppose so.
- Mm-hmm.

313
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,984
Jimmy's Mountains.

314
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,154
We get to the Willamette Valley,

315
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,573
I'll tell the cartographers.

316
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,826
We'll print it on the map.

317
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,829
Hmm?

318
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,331
I don't know, Mr. Meek.

319
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,338
You never womaned, Mr. Meek?

320
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,758
Indeed I have.

321
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,094
Numerous times.

322
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,597
Squaws in these parts start lookin'
mighty white after 20 years' time.

323
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,474
Oh, dear.

324
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:55,118
Sometimes I get the sense
you don't care for me much, Mrs. Tetherow.

325
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,121
Oh, I have no feelings
one way or the other, Mr. Meek.

326
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:02,584
That's... That's just a kind way
of saying you don't like me.

327
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,795
I don't like where we are.

328
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,673
So, that's what you think,
that we're lost?

329
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:12,218
- I'd say that seems about the right word for it.
- We're not lost.

330
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,971
We're not lost.
We're just finding our way.

331
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,890
I certainly hope so.

332
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,309
We gonna make all right.

333
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,936
Oh, you don't need
to patronize me, Mr. Meek.

334
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:25,064
Well, now I think
you're flirtin' with me, ma'am.

335
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,445
You don't know much about women,
do you, Stephen Meek?

336
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,448
Why, I-I know... somethin' or other.

337
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:36,993
If you say so.

338
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,914
Well, I know women are different from men.
I know that much.

339
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,168
I'll tell you the difference,
if you care to hear it.

340
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,070
I don't doubt you will.

341
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,255
Women-

342
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:53,009
Women are created
on the principle of chaos-

343
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,804
the chaos of creation, disorder,
bringin' new things into the world.

344
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,600
Men are created
on the principle of destruction.

345
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,104
It's like cleansing,
ordering destruction.

346
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:09,400
You think I'm wrong,
you can tell me.

347
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,737
Chaos and destruction.
Those two genders are always at it.

348
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,158
Chaos and destruction.

349
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,035
Well, I don't know.

350
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,746
I have to think about it.

351
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,540
Mm-hmm.

352
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,583
Jimmy, I told you not to wander.

353
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,752
- I wasn't wandering, Ma.
- Jimmy!

354
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,380
- Ma, I-
- You were wandering.

355
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:33,967
If you wander again,
your father will tan you.

356
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,141
You found this?

357
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,186
Just down the gully.
There's lots.

358
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,688
More? How much more?

359
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,691
Enough to fill this bucket
more times than I can count.

360
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,693
Jimmy, you know about exaggerating.

361
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,695
It's the neighbor to a lie.

362
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,363
Look.

363
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,365
Hmm.

364
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,950
Here.

365
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,751
It's real, all right.

366
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,837
<i>Vבlgame Dios.</i>

367
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,839
The Lord has his plan, I'd say.

368
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,049
Brought us here by dark design.

369
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,263
Mm-hmm.

370
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,806
Well,

371
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,726
let's get this done.

372
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,352
You can't drink gold.

373
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,865
Some timing.

374
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,180
Am I right in understandin'...

375
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,182
that you and Mrs. Tetherow
was recently hitched?

376
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,850
That's right.

377
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,772
Took you a while to get settled down,
I'd say.

378
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,026
Must have grown accustomed
to your freedom.

379
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,113
I was settled before.
She passed away.

380
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,491
I'm sorry to hear that.

381
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,494
You're a lucky man though.

382
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,372
Found yourself a nice, young woman-

383
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,708
Jimmy, where are you?

384
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,961
- Jimmy! Where are you?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

385
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,673
- I saw him! I saw the Indian!
- Jimmy.

386
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,759
- The one with the scar!
- Where? Which way, exactly?

387
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,637
- That-a-way, Mr. Meek.
- How far gone?

388
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,639
Not a quarter-mile.

389
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,016
- And he saw you?
- Oh, yes.

390
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,977
Good boy.

391
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,563
Jimmy! Come here!
You mustn't wander off.

392
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,691
Keep on this path north.
I'll be back when I got him.

393
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,443
Wait. Solomon!

394
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,570
- I'll be back.
- Please!

395
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,155
I'll be back!

396
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,713
Well, you heard them.

397
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,341
We'll keep moving.

398
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,532
They haven't been long.

399
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,537
It's not been long, Henley.

400
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,981
What's wrong, Sylvie?

401
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,778
Come here.

402
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:09,158
"Behold, him that keepeth Israel
shall neither slumber nor sleep.

403
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:13,663
The Lord is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.

404
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,373
The sun shall not smite thee.

405
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,808
"The Lord is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.

406
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,811
The sun shall not smite thee."

407
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,951
He's a quick one.

408
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,204
Might have gotten away
if it hadn't been for Meek's eye.

409
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,414
Horse got away though.

410
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,417
Now, I know my word isn't worth much
in these parts,

411
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:28,047
but in this case I'm just as sure
as sundown we kill him now.

412
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,139
What do you think, Solomon?

413
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,308
You brought him for a reason.

414
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,062
He's from these parts.

415
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,563
He's healthy.

416
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,440
He knows where the water is.

417
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,817
That's my reasoning.

418
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,444
He's barely clothed.

419
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,697
He'd just as soon die with us.

420
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,868
They don't think of life
the way we do.

421
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,538
That's documented fact.

422
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,916
I think we need him.

423
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,757
I don't like it,
but I see your logic.

424
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,344
Oh, my, don't this beat all.

425
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,973
You know what I've seen
his heathen's brothers do?

426
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,767
Strip the flesh clean off a man
while he's still breathin'.

427
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,524
I've seen 'em
cut a man's eyelids off...

428
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,526
and bury him in the sand...

429
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,946
and leave him just starin' at the sun.

430
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,366
You can feed 'em. You can treat 'em
to the best fixings in your lodge.

431
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,953
They'll turn around- Boom!
Steal your horses.

432
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,623
We've come to a terrible place.

433
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,878
What do you think?

434
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,382
We need water.
That much I know.

435
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:56,385
Yeah. I don't see any other way.

436
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,679
Can't say I do either.

437
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,807
Well, let's take a vote.
Who says we keep him?

438
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,904
- Aye.
- Aye.

439
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,157
Got some pumpkins.

440
00:51:27,012 --> 00:51:28,517
What are they saying?

441
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:32,505
- How do we get our meaning across?
- Hell if I know.

442
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,092
Water.

443
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:39,261
Where's water?
Do you know water?

444
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,557
He doesn't know the word "water."

445
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:47,394
Where's water?
Here. Drink. Drink.

446
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,021
Water?

447
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,357
He doesn't understand.

448
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,778
You know the word "water,"
you dumb son of a bitch!

449
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,557
That's right, you mongrel.

450
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,392
- Mr. Meek!
- Get away.

451
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,812
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

452
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,355
It ain't Main Street.

453
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,567
It ain't the village green.

454
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,133
Please.

455
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,582
Here.

456
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:51,917
Yours.

457
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,467
One now, for you.

458
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,721
One later.

459
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,058
Water. Us?

460
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,228
Blanket.

461
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,397
You.

462
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,316
Understand?

463
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,834
That there is the law of the land,
Mr. Meek.

464
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,670
Barter.

465
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,606
- Evening.
- Evening.

466
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,442
I'll take first watch.

467
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,240
That's fine.

468
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,866
Dandy.

469
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,533
Excuse me.

470
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,663
Blue Mountains out that way, eventually.

471
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,877
His country. About what you'd expect.

472
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,522
He's a killer, ma'am.

473
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,607
Don't get too close.

474
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,426
What?

475
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,846
Well, everything the steers have
is one less thing for us.

476
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,354
Mr. Tetherow?

477
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,982
Yes, ma'am.

478
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:15,861
How much further by your calculation?

479
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,573
Well, it's hard to say, you know.

480
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,950
It's doubtful it's more
than a day's journey from here.

481
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:26,496
The Indian, he wasn't carrying anything,
so he can't have come far.

482
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:29,583
So we'll find water today.

483
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,877
It would be a day alone.

484
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:36,632
For us, it could be today.
It could be tomorrow.

485
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,251
What are you doing, Emily?

486
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:39,254
I'm going to fix his boot.

487
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,797
You shouldn't.

488
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,258
Well, I don't like it
any more than you do.

489
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,802
But I want him to owe me something.

490
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:08,366
It's a pin.

491
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,704
For sewing.

492
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,291
That's nothing.

493
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,547
You can't even imagine
what we've done.

494
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,717
The cities we've built.

495
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:41,066
Oh, God, the stench.

496
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,867
Hold on. Let me finish.

497
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,167
There.

498
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,940
How far do we have to go?

499
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,284
How far do we have to go?

500
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,912
How long?

501
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,555
A man-child.

502
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,271
How's your friend?

503
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,856
Wha-

504
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:09,613
About the same as the rest of us,
I'd say.

505
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:12,115
Thirsty, hungry.

506
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:18,330
I was just onto telling Mr. Gately here
about the time...

507
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,874
I surprised a band of Blackfeet...

508
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,001
down by the headwaters
of the Missouri.

509
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,087
It was quite a day.

510
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,757
See, our group was armed,

511
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,134
and theirs wasn't.

512
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:34,846
We pulled up, and they all
just dove into the water.

513
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,683
We lay there on the bank...

514
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,645
and shot 'em when they come up for air.

515
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,273
Passed the whole afternoon that way.

516
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,276
Just ducking and diving and shooting.

517
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,278
It was a good ol' time.

518
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,448
- Is this meant to bring me over to something?
- No, ma'am.

519
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:56,368
And I don't excuse
what we did there that day.

520
01:05:57,536 --> 01:06:00,288
You know, playing games
with those men's lives.

521
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,415
I don't paint myself
as anything but a sinner.

522
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,000
But your friend there-

523
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:09,714
He's worse than a sinner
'cause he don't even know he's sinning.

524
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,969
It's the Cayuse we're talking about-
"The People of the Stones."

525
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,513
Even Indians despise these Indians.

526
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,310
They're slave traders. They're welchers.
It's even worse.

527
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:25,146
Well, you could go your own way anytime,
Mr. Meek.

528
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,148
Stephen Meek does not shirk a fight.

529
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:30,819
If there's blood to be shed,
I'll be there.

530
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:34,155
- I'll put in my share.
- Vanity.

531
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,408
That's all I see.

532
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:40,346
<i>Nearer to Thee</i>

533
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,475
<i>Even though it be a cross</i>

534
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,519
<i>That raiseth me</i>

535
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,814
<i>Still, all my song shall be</i>

536
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:56,404
<i>Nearer, my God, to Thee</i>

537
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,741
<i>Nearer to Thee</i>

538
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,911
<i>Though like the wanderer</i>

539
01:08:04,495 --> 01:08:05,455
Millie, stay back.

540
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:08,833
Mr. Gately.
Mr. Gately, what is it?

541
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,086
William-
Mr. White, give me a hand.

542
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:13,463
Here. Here.

543
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:16,091
Oh, my God, I knew it.

544
01:08:22,972 --> 01:08:23,932
Okay.

545
01:08:26,016 --> 01:08:27,644
Oh. Look at this.

546
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:30,647
Here. This is what Millie
saw him leaving behind earlier.

547
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:32,899
She saw this tonight
and she came out.

548
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:35,235
What is it?

549
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,946
We caught him signaling to someone,
leaving word behind.

550
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,573
I caught him myself.
Look at this. Look at this.

551
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:44,202
It means something.
He's been making them every step of the way.

552
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,372
- What does it mean?
- Hell if I know.

553
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,791
But it means something to somebody.

554
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,963
It's a message. Just look at it.

555
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,465
This is nothing. This is religion.

556
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:01,010
- It's how they pray to their gods.
- No, it's a signal.

557
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,555
They're out there looking for him,
his kin,

558
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,807
and he's leading them right along.

559
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:08,601
Open your eyes, Solomon.
God knows where he's taking us.

560
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:11,813
He's been walking up the ridges
as if he's looking for someone.

561
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,149
- Finally, they're coming around.
- After all we've done?

562
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,860
God knows what mischief
he's made already.

563
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,945
Millie, quiet down.

564
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,489
Let's hang him
from the wagon tongues tonight.

565
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,491
It's better late than never.

566
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,910
- That's a message.
- No.

567
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,333
This is nothing.

568
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:35,211
There's no one out there.

569
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,089
They'd have made themselves known by now.

570
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:43,803
Go back to bed.

571
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:46,973
This will all look different
in the light of day.

572
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:49,434
It's on your head, Solomon.

573
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:56,107
That's fine.
Give it another day.

574
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:05,783
Well, we'll get that blanket of yours back
one way or another, my friend.

575
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:07,178
Come ha. Come ha.

576
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,895
Come ha.

577
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,563
Come ha. Come ha.

578
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,033
It's a sign!

579
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,578
A sign! A sign!

580
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,789
Calm down, Millie.

581
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,499
They made it.

582
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:39,419
- They're giving him orders!
- It's nothing.

583
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:41,421
- You'll see.
- Step up.

584
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:44,299
- We'll all see.
- Come on. Calm down.

585
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,758
Step up!

586
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,468
- Please, Thomas.
- Step up.

587
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:49,804
- Please, I wanna go home.
- Step up.

588
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:52,682
- I wanna go home.
- Step up.

589
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:29,927
Whoa! Whoa!

590
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,383
- What's he saying?
- Well, who knows?

591
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,136
He's saying we're close.
He's saying-

592
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,972
He's saying,
"Just over the hill. Just over there."

593
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,341
It's a steep grade.

594
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,511
Can the wagons make it?

595
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,888
I don't see much choice.

596
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,143
Well, someone could go on ahead.

597
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,812
It can't be far now.

598
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:06,232
They could come back
and let us know what's ahead.

599
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,526
No. We're together.

600
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,653
We're- We're all in this the same.

601
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:12,738
Yeah, up to our necks.

602
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,617
We can make it all right.

603
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,786
Just go one wagon at a time.

604
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,667
Tighten up.

605
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:49,168
Don't put yourself out, boy.

606
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:52,838
Go find some shade.
We'll come find you when we're done.

607
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:57,111
All right. Get back up.

608
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:05,573
Ma, make some room in the wagon.

609
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:08,868
- We'll be needing to take on some weight.
- We'll make room too.

610
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,747
- That's mighty white of you.
- This was his plan all along.

611
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:15,833
- It's just what he wanted.
- Millie, calm down, please.

612
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,002
They're coming.

613
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:21,130
- They're almost here!
- Millie, calm down.

614
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,062
We'll make the crossing,

615
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:40,149
and on the other side,
we'll start fresh.

616
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:42,985
All you need is your-

617
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:46,864
All you need is your strong back.

618
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,216
What's in this?

619
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,140
Yeah, we use that.

620
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,227
Hey! Hey!
Put that down!

621
01:20:18,855 --> 01:20:21,398
That don't belong to you!

622
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:25,820
Have some respect!

623
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:31,075
Hey! I said put that down, heathen!

624
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:39,625
I'm warning you. If you don't put that down
right now, you're gonna be mighty sorry.

625
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:43,379
What does it matter?
Just let him be.

626
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:46,924
Well, it's the principle of the matter.

627
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:54,181
All right, that's it.
That's it.

628
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,309
You've taken us just about as far
as you need to go.

629
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:58,853
End this game right now.

630
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:03,065
Put it away, Meek.
There's no need.

631
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:05,276
Oh, I see a need.

632
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:12,950
Well, you- so you got
some feeling in you after all.

633
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,126
I'd be wary.

634
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:48,444
You people got no idea
what you're dealing with here.

635
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:53,407
Well, neither do you, Mr. Meek.
You've proved that amply by now.

636
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:58,871
It seems like your woman
got some Indian blood in her, Mr. Tetherow.

637
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:00,956
She's got something, all right.

638
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,336
Yeah, you think this heathen's
as good as his word.

639
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:09,840
You got no idea what he's fixing to do.
It could be-

640
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,842
Who knows what's over that hill?

641
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:15,679
Could be water.

642
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,307
Could be an army of heathens.

643
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:22,144
Could be.

644
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,414
Well, maybe you'd like to wager.

645
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:47,252
Water or blood.

646
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:53,217
I'll leave the wagering
to men like you.

647
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:57,596
Don't think you ain't wagering.

648
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:03,143
And you don't even know
what cards you got.

649
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:15,656
That's some pumpkins.

650
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,282
You a lucky savage, boy.

651
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,368
You got a guardian angel here.

652
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,915
All in good time.

653
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,711
All in good time
the cards are gonna fall.

654
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:30,796
They're gonna fall real soon.

655
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:45,162
Thank you.

656
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:19,196
Heavenly Father,
we thank you for this food...

657
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,865
and for the many mercies
you have blessed us with.

658
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:26,036
We ask that you continue
to protect us on our journey...

659
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:30,457
and guide us as it is thy will.

660
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,709
In Christ's name. Amen.

661
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,295
- Amen.
- Amen.

662
01:25:54,357 --> 01:25:59,111
I'm just thinking
of my father's pigs back home.

663
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:04,491
All safe and warm in their pens.

664
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:25,095
Emily.

665
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,187
Oh, William, thank you.

666
01:26:40,778 --> 01:26:42,905
What do you see out there?

667
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:47,451
Hard to say.

668
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:53,123
No, there's no saying, is there?

669
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:59,463
Do you think he's trustworthy?

670
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:03,300
The Indian?

671
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,264
I can't... say as I do.

672
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,559
I trust you is all.

673
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,606
But you're putting your trust in him.

674
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:30,661
You're doubtful.

675
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,665
I have my doubts.

676
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:43,548
What are you thinking, Solomon?

677
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:47,719
I-

678
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:54,268
I just hope Meek 
hasn't twisted you up, is all.

679
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:10,130
Whoa! Whoa!

680
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:12,132
- Whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!

681
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:25,479
He won't drink.
I've tried every day, but he refuses.

682
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:28,064
Emily, I don't know what to do.

683
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:31,109
Please. Please.

684
01:31:32,194 --> 01:31:34,112
My darling, I know.

685
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:35,780
I know.

686
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:41,411
I know, I know, I know.

687
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,121
I know.

688
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:47,083
We're close, friend.
Stay with us.

689
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,627
You stay with us.

690
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:52,714
Please, please drink, my darling.
Please.

691
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:56,885
Please, William.

692
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:59,721
- Drink some more.
- Please, William.

693
01:31:59,805 --> 01:32:03,016
Mrs. White, we're gonna have to make
some more room in the wagon.

694
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,643
Of course.

695
01:32:06,437 --> 01:32:08,730
Jimmy, stay with your father.

696
01:32:10,983 --> 01:32:12,484
Oh, William.

697
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:21,701
Drink. There you go.

698
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:24,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

699
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:27,494
Whoa! Whoa!

700
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:10,286
Mama, a tree can't live without water.
Can it?

701
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:14,541
Thomas, we can still go back.
We can try for the Columbia.

702
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:16,126
Millie, we're close.

703
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:19,045
That's just it. We're close,
but we don't know what to.

704
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:22,841
We've been through this.
We don't know, either way.

705
01:35:25,177 --> 01:35:28,722
Thomas, please.
We still have a choice.

706
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:34,561
What about you, Mrs. White?

707
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:37,230
Which way does your family prefer?

708
01:35:37,314 --> 01:35:39,315
We stay the course.

709
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:44,612
We don't have a choice,
not that I see.

710
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:46,281
Meek?

711
01:35:55,374 --> 01:35:59,002
I'm taking my orders from you now,
Mr. Tetherow,

712
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:00,795
Mrs. Tetherow.

713
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:05,008
And we're all taking our orders from him,
I'd say.

714
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,762
We're all just playing our parts now.

715
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:11,264
This was written long 
before we got here.

716
01:36:13,517 --> 01:36:15,518
I'm at your command.

717
01:36:16,305 --> 01:37:16,516

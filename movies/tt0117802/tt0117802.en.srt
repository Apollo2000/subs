{1002}{1201}You're nobody|'til somebody loves you
{1203}{1401}You're nobody|'til somebody cares
{1464}{1629}You may be king|You may possess the world
{1632}{1707}And its gold
{1710}{1809}But gold won't bring you|happiness
{1812}{1937}When you're growin' old
{1940}{2009}The world still is the same
{2012}{2096}You never change it
{2159}{2258}As sure as the stars
{2259}{2363}Shine above
{2366}{2597}You're nobody|'til somebody loves you
{2600}{2756}So find yourself|somebody to love
{3736}{3811}The world|still is the same
{3812}{3939}You never change it
{3942}{4056}As sure as the stars

{4764}{4871}- Okay, so what if I don't|want to give up on her?|- You don't call.
{4874}{4964}- You said I don't call if|I wanted to give up on her.|- Right.
{4965}{5057}- So I don't call either way.|- Right.
{5060}{5168}- So what's the difference?|- There is no difference right now.
{5171}{5261}See, Mike, the only difference|between giving up and not giving up...
{5263}{5342}is if you take her back|when she wants to come back.
{5344}{5422}But you can't do anything|to make her want to come back.
{5425}{5517}In fact, you can only do stuff|to make her not want to come back.
{5518}{5635}So the only difference is|if I forget about her or just|pretend to forget about her.
{5636}{5722}- Right.|- Well, that sucks.
{5725}{5802}Yeah, it sucks.
{5805}{5934}So it's like a retroactive|decision then? I mean, I|could, like, forget about her.
{5937}{6036}And then when she comes back, make like|I just pretended to forget about her?
{6078}{6177}Right, although probably|more likely the opposite.
{6178}{6236}What do you mean?
{6237}{6327}I mean, at first you're gonna pretend|to forget about her.
{6328}{6401}Not call her,|I don't know, whatever.
{6402}{6471}But then, eventually,|you really will forget about her.
{6474}{6576}- Well, unless she comes back first.|- Mm, see, that's the thing.
{6577}{6663}Somehow they know not to come back|until you really forget.
{6776}{6854}- There's the rub.|- There's the rub.
{6944}{7106}Look, man, uh, I-I'm sorry we always|talk about the same thing all the time.
{7109}{7208}- Ah, no, it's all right.|- It's just that, you know...|It's just you been there, man.
{7211}{7280}- Don't sweat it.|- Your advice really helps.|And I just, I don't know...
{7281}{7394}You know, Rob, you're the only one|I can talk to about her.
{7397}{7487}Thanks. Thanks, man.
{7571}{7685}Hello, you have four messages.
{7688}{7768}Message one.
{7771}{7833}Hey, gorgeous,|it's, uh, Trent calling.
{7834}{7930}Look, you gotta get that girl|out of your head. Uh, I hope my...
{7933}{8017}Message two.
{8020}{8107}Hey, Mike, uh, if you want|to talk about Michelle, give me...
{8110}{8182}Message three.
{8185}{8269}Did she call yet? I'm sure she...|- Message four.
{8272}{8373}Michael, this is Grandma.
{8374}{8446}We all miss you|back here in New York.
{8449}{8536}You still haven't told me if you got|that part on the television pro...
{8539}{8667}That was your last message.
{8721}{8823}You have to put things in perspective.
{8826}{8928}- I know, I know.|- She doesn't deserve you.
{8931}{8988}Thanks. I appreciate that.
{8991}{9063}There are plenty of fish|in the sea.
{9066}{9137}Okay, that's great advice.|Thanks a lot. Okay? Bye.
{9138}{9230}- Life, after all...|- Please, I'm trying|to make a phone call.
{9231}{9321}- Are you calling her?|- No. Will you stop? I'm try... Please.
{9483}{9542}- Hello?|- What's up, Trent?
{9543}{9635}Hey, we got two parties|tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
{9638}{9725}- I don't know.|- Listen to me, baby. There's|gonna be beautiful babies there.
{9728}{9811}I... Look, Trent, uh,|I got shit to do tomorrow.
{9812}{9902}Listen to you.|I've got a final callback on a pilot|at 9:00, and I'm going to this thing.
{9903}{9982}Come on, Mike, you got to get out|with the beautiful babies.
{9983}{10061}- You can't sit|at home thinking about it.|- Not tonight.
{10063}{10141}Not tonight? Listen to you!|We're gonna have fun tonight.
{10144}{10216}- We gotta get you out|of that stuffy apartment.
{10219}{10312}We're gonna spend half the night|driving around the hills looking|for this one party,
{10313}{10387}and you're gonna say it sucks,|and we're all gonna leave,
{10388}{10452}and then we're gonna go look|for this other party.
{10453}{10516}But all the parties|and all the bars, they all suck.
{10519}{10605}I spend half the night talkin' to some|girl who's lookin' around the room...
{10608}{10713}to see if there's somebody else who's|more important she should be talking to.
{10714}{10818}And it's like I'm supposed|to be all happy, uh, 'cause|she's wearing a backpack.
{10819}{10902}I... You know, and half of them|are just nasty skanks...
{10905}{11016}who wouldn't be nothing, except|they're surrounded by a bunch|of drunken, horny assholes.
{11019}{11088}I'm gonna tell you something, T.|Are you listening?
{11091}{11211}- Yeah, I'm listening.|- I'm not gonna be one of|those assholes, all right?
{11214}{11271}It just makes me sick.
{11274}{11355}It's like, uh, some nasty skank who|isn't half the woman my girlfriend is...
{11356}{11414}is gonna front me?
{11415}{11474}- It makes me want to fuckin' puke.|- Jesus Christ!
{11475}{11564}Will you shut up for a minute? We gotta|get you the fuck out of Dodge, man.
{11565}{11666}- We're goin' to Vegas tonight.|- What are you talkin' about?
{11667}{11758}- Vegas, baby. Vegas!|- What do you mean, Vegas?
{11759}{11848}- Vegas. Las Vegas.|- I'm not going to no Vegas.
{11849}{11945}Yeah. I think... You know what, man?|We're gonna go to Vegas and, uh...
{11948}{12005}- When are we going to Vegas?|- We're going tonight.
{12008}{12074}- No, we're not going tonight.|I'm not going to Vegas!|- I'm gonna pick you up.
{12077}{12158}- Listen to me.|- No, you listen to me.|I'm not going, okay?
{12161}{12275}- None of this shit anymore.|- Listen, I just listened|to you; now hear me out.
{12276}{12359}You bring something nice to wear.
{12362}{12422}- I'm not going to Vegas.|- Mike, we're going.
{12425}{12482}I'm not going to Vegas.
{12485}{12613}All right, listen. I took out $300,|but I'm only betting with 100.
{12616}{12709}I can't afford any more|than that, all right?
{12712}{12778}And I figure if we buy a lot of chips,|though, the pit boss will see us,
{12781}{12850}he'll comp us all sorts of free shit;|that's how it works over there.
{12853}{12910}- But you gotta be cool.|- I'm cool, baby, I'm cool.
{12913}{13003}They're gonna give Daddy a room,|some breakfast, maybe Bennett singing.
{13006}{13081}- I know just the place.|- What the hell are you wearin'?
{13084}{13143}I thought you said|we're gonna wear suits.
{13144}{13228}Oh, Mike, you gotta stop worrying|about this. We're goin' to Vegas, man.
{13231}{13336}If you're wearing a suit,|and you look like you gamble|a lot, they give you free shit.
{13339}{13405}It's in the back.|I'll put it on when we get there.
{13408}{13473}Uh-uh. No way. No, turn around.|I'm goin' home.
{13476}{13547}You gotta show up wearing that suit,|or otherwise I'm not going.
{13548}{13668}All right already, okay? I'll put my|suit on. Grab the wheel. Hold it steady.
{13669}{13740}- I'm tellin' you, this is how you do it.|- I know!
{13743}{13824}- They're watching you when you|drive up. That's how it works.|- Fine, fine.
{13827}{13881}It could work.|I'm serious.
{13884}{13959}They're gonna give Daddy|the Rain Man suite. You dig that?
{13960}{14022}- We're going to Vegas, Mike. Vegas!|- Vegas!
{14025}{14082}You think we can|get there by midnight?
{14085}{14142}- We're gonna be up five|"hundy" by midnight!|- Yeah!
{14145}{14253}- Vegas! Vegas!|- Vegas, baby. Vegas!
{14418}{14498}Vegas, baby. Vegas.
{14501}{14648}'Cause I'm not the happy guy|I used to be
{14693}{14783}She thinks I
{14786}{14927}Still care
{14929}{15046}But if she's happy thinking
{15049}{15127}I still need her
{15235}{15298}Vegas, baby. Vegas.
{15456}{15513}Vegas.
{16284}{16370}It's the root of all evil|Of strife and upheaval
{16373}{16457}But I'm certain, honey
{16502}{16595}That life would be sunny
{16598}{16712}With plenty of money
{16715}{16835}And you
{17174}{17246}I always thought, uh,|Caesar's was more the dope spot.
{17249}{17350}Back in their day, this place|was a real contender, but now|they'll appreciate the business.
{17353}{17446}They'll probably fall all over|themselves for a couple of|high-class guys like me and you.
{17449}{17521}- Now, we're not...|- You want to be fresh|on the scene, right?
{17524}{17614}The new places down on the strip,|now, those places are supposed to be it.
{17615}{17704}Oh, Mike, you don't want|all that fuckin' Pirate|of the Caribbean horseshit.
{17707}{17764}Or the rock and roll|grunge tip.
{17767}{17845}You know, guys like me and|you gotta kick it here. Old school.
{17848}{17916}Yeah, this is...|This is truly old school.
{17917}{18037}- Definitely old school.|- This place is fuckin' dead.
{18040}{18115}You know, I'm gonna find me|two waitresses here|and I'm gonna pull me a Fredo.
{18118}{18184}- Yeah, well, they're all skanks.|- What are you talkin' about?
{18187}{18244}Look at all the|beautiful babies here.
{18247}{18336}The beautiful babies don't work|midnights to 6:00 on a... on a Wednesday.
{18339}{18426}- This is the skank shift.|- Look at all the beautiful honeys here.
{18429}{18543}- Excuse me.|- Excuse me, darling. I want you|to remember this face here.
{18546}{18663}This is the guy behind the guy|behind the guy.
{18723}{18800}Okay.
{18801}{18881}Will you cut that shit out?
{18882}{18963}- What? She smiled.|- That's not cool, man.
{18966}{19047}- Did she or did she not smile?|- It doesn't matter.
{19050}{19140}- Mike, I'm telling you,|girls love that stuff.|- You're gonna screw up our plan.
{19143}{19250}- Baby, we're gonna get laid.|- Could we first see what happens|when we play it cool?
{19253}{19382}What do you think, Mike?|Do you think she's gonna leave us|and go tell her pit boss on us?
{19385}{19442}Will you stop makin' fun,|all right?
{19445}{19547}The trick is we gotta look|like we don't need the shit,|then they give us shit for free.
{19548}{19625}Right, right, right.|Well, I think you look great, man.
{19628}{19718}I think I'm looking like the money,|like the bomb, right?
{19720}{19831}All right, stop. See that? That, uh,|table? That's where we make our scene.
{19832}{19891}You think|they'll notice me and you?
{19894}{19969}Oh, they're gonna notice me and you,|'cause they're watching.
{19975}{20068}- Nicely done, sir.|You're on a streak now.|- It's about time.
{20071}{20202}One of the best streaks|I've ever had. I wanna get even.
{20319}{20439}Uh, start with, uh,|I don't know, 300?
{20892}{20985}I can count that|for you.
{20988}{21045}- On the table.|- Excuse me?
{21048}{21170}- You have to lay it on the table.|- I don't want to bet it all.
{21173}{21230}You're not allowed|to hand me money, sir.
{21233}{21329}You have to lay it on the table|if you want me to change it.
{21551}{21668}- Changing 300.|- Three hundred.
{21896}{22007}- Do you have anything smaller?|- Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
{22008}{22106}But this happens to be|a $100 minimum bet table.
{22109}{22186}Perhaps you'd be more comfortable|at one of our lower stakes tables.
{22243}{22348}Okay, just tuck 'em under,|just like this.
{22351}{22408}There you go.
{22444}{22507}Cocktails?
{22510}{22573}Guy behind the guy.
{22576}{22645}I'll have a scotch|on the rocks, please.
{22648}{22729}Any scotch will do, as long|as it's not a blend, of course.
{22730}{22819}Uh, single malt.|Glenlivet, Glenfiddich perhaps.
{22820}{22882}Maybe a Glengow... Any Glen.
{22883}{22957}Scotch on the rocks.
{23568}{23628}- Double down.|- What?
{23631}{23697}You got an 11.|You always double down on an 11.
{23700}{23760}I know, but it's $200.|It's blood money.
{23763}{23823}- Mike, you gotta double down.|- I can't double down.
{23826}{23886}- Mike, if you don't look like|you know what you're doing...|- Will you stop for a second?
{23889}{23958}- Just shut up, okay? I can't.|- If you don't look like you|know what you're doing...
{23959}{24015}Just stop for a second!
{24095}{24149}Double down.
{24224}{24295}That's nice.
{24296}{24356}Eighteen. Good. Eighteen's good.
{24506}{24614}Twelve. Sixteen.
{24721}{24784}Twenty-one.
{24835}{24904}I'm telling you, baby,|you always double down on an 11.
{24905}{24967}- Well, obviously not always.|- Always, baby.
{24970}{25038}I'm just saying not|in this particular case.
{25041}{25128}- You always double...|- I lost, okay?|How could you say "always"?
{25131}{25257}- Lady has 11.|What would you like to do?|- Um, I hit.
{25260}{25371}- Fifteen.|- I don't know what to do here.
{25374}{25443}I'll hit again.
{25446}{25503}Seventeen.
{25548}{25641}Okay. I'll hit there. Okay.
{25644}{25725}- Twenty-one.|- Oh, my gosh! Twenty-one!
{25728}{25812}I got it!|Oh, my heavens. Thank you!
{25815}{25874}Whee!
{25875}{25958}Would you like to have some breakfast|this morning, ma'am?
{25961}{26069}Oh, I really shouldn't. But then again,|it's a good idea. I'd love it.
{26072}{26135}- Thank you so much!|- Why not? By all means.
{26138}{26195}- Take this ticket in with you|when you go in.|- Oh, thank you!
{26198}{26255}- They'll fix you up.|- You'll fix me up.
{26357}{26458}That went plenty nice, baby.|You're up 20 bucks.
{26459}{26537}You know, I mean not counting|what happened on the first table.
{26538}{26603}- Thanks for clarifying that.|- I'm down too, Mike.
{26606}{26708}- Yeah? What'd you lose?|- I don't know what I dropped.
{26711}{26780}Let's see, I dropped|probably 35 or...
{26783}{26881}Don't give me that shit. You know|exactly what you lost. What'd you drop?
{26882}{26989}Twenty, all right? But I was|down at least fifty. I'm sorry.|I got lucky on the craps table.
{26992}{27073}You shouldn't be sorry.|You're a winner. I'm the fuckin' loser.
{27076}{27142}- I'm the one who should be sorry.|- Baby, don't talk that way.
{27145}{27208}Could we just go, please?|Could we go?
{27211}{27268}Baby, look at me. Look at me.
{27271}{27358}You're money. And you know what else?|You're a big winner tonight.
{27361}{27418}- I want to leave.|- You're a big winner.
{27421}{27505}I'm gonna ask you a simple question,|and I want you to listen to me.
{27506}{27634}Who's the big winner|here tonight at the casino? Huh?
{27637}{27712}- Mikey, that's who.|Mikey's the big winner.|- Okay.
{27713}{27771}- Mikey wins.|- What a fuckin' asshole.
{27772}{27859}Fine, I'm an asshole.|But you know what?|You're the big winner tonight, Mikey.
{27862}{27924}- You're the big winner|in more ways than one.|- There you two are.
{27927}{28029}I walked around for an hour|with that stupid scotch on my tray.
{28032}{28104}We got knocked out pretty fast.
{28107}{28173}- Ah, a couple of|high rollers like yourself?|- Can you believe it?
{28176}{28245}- I'm gonna get you that scotch.|- You know, forget about it.
{28248}{28326}- I didn't even want it.|I just wanted to order it.|- Can I get you something else?
{28329}{28422}I mean, you really shouldn't leave|without getting something for free.
{28425}{28482}Why ruin a perfect night?
{28485}{28575}Listen, um, bring a single-malted,|uh, Glengarry for me...
{28576}{28634}and one|for my boy Mikey here.
{28635}{28728}And if you tell the bartender|to go easy on the water,
{28731}{28862}then this 50-cent piece has your|name written all over it, okay?
{28863}{28931}I want you to run along,|'cause I'll be timing you.
{28934}{29069}I'm gonna keep time.|One, two, three, four.
{29072}{29171}- What an asshole.|- Baby, that was money.|Tell me that wasn't money.
{29174}{29242}- That was so demeaning.|- She smiled, baby.
{29243}{29333}- I can't believe|what an asshole you are.|- No, baby, she smiled.
{29334}{29422}- She was smiling at|what an asshole you are.|- No, no, no, no, no.
{29422}{29500}- She was smiling at how money|I was, what I did with her.|- Could we get out of here?
{29503}{29590}- I'm not gonna pay for a room.|- Mike, what the hell do you|want to get out of here for?
{29593}{29665}- The honey baby's|bringing us a cocktail.|- What, are you nuts?
{29668}{29739}- You think she's coming back here?|- I know she's coming back.
{29740}{29829}Did you hear what she said?|"You shouldn't leave without|getting something for free. "
{29830}{29916}Baby, she wants to party.|She wants to.
{29919}{29976}I'm tired. We should just go.
{29979}{30072}Baby, this is what we came for. Now, we|met a beautiful baby, and she likes you.
{30075}{30165}- She likes you.|- Whatever. Daddy's gonna|get her to bring a friend.
{30168}{30264}Now, I don't care if I end up with her|or one of her beautiful baby friends.
{30339}{30440}It's just I been... I been out|of the game for so long, man.
{30441}{30561}- It's been like six years.|- Listen, it's hard, I know.|I been there myself.
{30564}{30609}Not for six years or anything,|but I've been there.
{30610}{30654}Not for six years or anything,|but I've been there.
{30657}{30735}The best thing you can do|is just get back out there.
{30738}{30857}It's just I... I'm not attracted to them.|I keep thinking of my girlfriend.
{30860}{30947}Then I'm trying to, like,|maintain a conversation with them.
{30950}{31064}Mike, do you even think I know|what the hell they're saying|to me half the time?
{31067}{31139}I don't know if they're talking|about how hard it is to be adopted...
{31142}{31214}or how their dad|can't show 'em affection.
{31217}{31319}All I do, man, is stare at their mouth|and wrinkle my eyebrows,
{31322}{31400}and somehow I turn out|to be a big sweetie, okay?
{31403}{31508}Take this girl here.|She's a waitress in Las Vegas.
{31511}{31628}But I bet somewhere inside of her|there is a very, very special dream.
{31631}{31703}And no matter how hard I try, I won't...
{31706}{31789}Hey, there she is, the most|special lady in town, right?
{31792}{31864}- Yup.|- What time do you get off, uh, Christy?
{31865}{31923}- 6:00.|- 6:00, great.
{31924}{32026}- Two Glengarrys down,|easy on the water.|- Fantastic.
{32029}{32119}Uh, listen. Why don't you call a friend|and have her meet the three of us...
{32122}{32197}- at the Bamboo Lounge at 6:01?|- You got it.
{32200}{32290}- All right?|- Sure. Hey.
{32371}{32466}That was so fuckin' money.|That was like the Jedi mind shit.
{32467}{32551}See, that's what I'm trying to tell you,|baby. Girls love that kind of stuff.
{32554}{32613}They don't go|for the sensitive shit.
{32614}{32715}You start talking to 'em about, uh,|you know, puppy dogs and ice cream.
{32718}{32820}They know what you want to do.|What do you think?|You really think they don't know?
{32823}{32907}- No. I know.|- They know what you want,|baby. Believe me.
{32908}{32981}When you pretend it's just|like a waste of their time.
{32982}{33084}You're gonna take 'em|that way eventually, right?|Don't apologize for it.
{33087}{33204}It's just that I get this thing|where I want to be a gentleman|and I wanna show respect.
{33205}{33279}Oh, Mike.|Respect, my ass.
{33282}{33342}What they respect is honesty.
{33345}{33462}Look, you see how they dress|when they go out, right?|They want you to notice 'em.
{33465}{33561}All you're doin' is letting|them know that it's working.|Get off this respect kick.
{33562}{33650}There's nothing wrong with letting|the girls know that you're money...
{33653}{33750}- and that you wanna party.|- You ready to order?
{33752}{33848}Yeah. I'll have a coffee...|Two, uh, two coffees.
{33849}{33929}And it says, uh, here,|"Breakfast anytime. "
{33930}{34001}That's right.
{34004}{34118}I'll have the, uh, pancakes and the,|uh, age of enlightenment, please.
{34121}{34196}And for you?
{34198}{34333}Oh, um, let's see,|I'll have the, um, the Toucan.
{34336}{34411}- Over easy.|- I'll be back with the coffee.
{34414}{34479}All right, great.|Nice, baby.
{34480}{34549}Renaissance.|It went over her head.
{34552}{34628}I should have said renaissance.|Age of enlightenment. I...
{34629}{34758}Oh, God! Like a Las Vegas|waitress is gonna get an obscure|French philosophical reference?
{34761}{34829}It's like I'm trying|to show off to her.
{34830}{34917}I may as well have just said,|"Let me jump your ignorant bones. "
{34920}{34992}Don't even sweat her.|We're gonna meet our honeys soon.
{34995}{35076}- You know Christy's friend|is gonna be money.|- It's 20 to.
{35079}{35178}- We gotta get out of here.|- Baby, will you relax|just for a minute here?
{35181}{35271}Excuse me. We have...|We're in a little bit of a hurry.
{35274}{35334}Hang on, Voltaire.
{35693}{35828}- I get paid for loving|- Hmm
{35829}{35897}Loving all the time
{35966}{36023}- How're you doin', guys?|- Hey, boys.
{36026}{36104}- We almost gave up on you.|- I'm sorry we're late.
{36107}{36197}- There's, uh, no clocks|in this town anywhere.|- No harm done.
{36200}{36259}- This is Lisa.|- Hi.
{36260}{36335}- I'm sorry. I never got your name.|- I'm Mike.
{36336}{36410}- Mike.|- This is Trent. We call him Double Down.
{36411}{36469}- Trent.|- Stop right there.
{36470}{36553}- Ladies, don't you always|double down on an 11?|- Always.
{36556}{36613}- No matter what. Like splitting aces.|- Whatever.
{36616}{36694}- Hi, Lisa. I'm Trent.|It's nice to meet you.|- Nice to meet you.
{36697}{36754}Lovely, uh, make-up job|you have there.
{36757}{36838}- Oh. Uh, Lisa works at the MGM Grand.|- I'm a Dorothy.
{36839}{36922}Oh, Lisa's a Dorothy.|That's great. That's great.
{36970}{37090}Well, we're not|in Kansas anymore.
{37207}{37309}So, uh, what do|you guys do?
{37312}{37387}Well, I'm a comedian.
{37530}{37635}Um, do you ever play out here?|I'd love to see you sometime.
{37638}{37695}- No.|- Why not?
{37698}{37803}Well, there are, uh... You know,|it's just different circuits.
{37806}{37893}- It's hard to explain.|You wouldn't understand.|- Who's your booking agent?
{37896}{37980}She... She knows...
{37983}{38082}Actually, I don't have|West Coast representation as of yet.
{38085}{38163}Oh, who's your representation|back East?
{38166}{38292}I didn't... I sort of freelanced on|my own, kind of found my own things.
{38295}{38364}- 'Cause I...|- So what do you do, Trent?
{38365}{38454}- I'm a producer.|- Oh! Cool!
{38456}{38513}That's great.
{38516}{38582}I'm really|not supposed to drink here.
{38585}{38723}We should go someplace else.|How's my place?
{38724}{38791}- Yeah, that's great.|- Yeah?
{38792}{38881}- All right?|- Yeah, we... Yeah, sure.
{38882}{38966}- Right.|- Because if you can't drink here...
{38969}{39026}- Then you can't drink.|- Why not?
{39028}{39115}- That'll be great.|- Okay, great. Let's go.
{39121}{39208}You were in Acapulco Beach?
{39211}{39286}We watch that all the time.
{39289}{39384}- No, no, no, no, wait.|- Yeah, yeah.
{39385}{39498}The worst was when I went in for|this Afterschool Special, right?
{39501}{39567}So I'm sitting|in the waiting room,
{39570}{39660}and there's all these little kids, uh,|sitting in the waiting room with me.
{39661}{39750}And I see that all the kids are signed|in for the exact same role as me.
{39753}{39840}- They're auditioning for|the same role as you?|- Right.
{39843}{39965}So, uh, I check the time and the place.|I'm where I'm supposed to be.
{39966}{40086}I call my agent up. She says, "Trent,|they asked for you specifically. "
{40089}{40170}- What was the thing?|- I don't know what it was.|It was "Drugs are Bad. "
{40173}{40254}"Jenny Eats Something. " Whatever.|It's Afterschool Special bullshit.
{40257}{40314}- Right.|- "Jenny Eats Something. "
{40317}{40427}The role I'm reading for is "brother. "|I'm reading for the part of "brother. "
{40430}{40505}Big brother|or little brother?
{40508}{40603}- Just brother, man. Just brother.|- No.
{40604}{40688}Just brother, right? Finally I get|to go in and meet everyone, right?
{40691}{40756}Mikey, I'm telling you,|I was money.
{40757}{40823}It's a starring role.|I practiced for a week.
{40826}{40937}So I'm reading with the casting director|and, girls, I literally start crying.
{40940}{40997}- No.|- I swear to God.
{41000}{41069}The casting director who's reading with|me kinda gets caught up in the vibe.
{41072}{41129}- She starts crying.|- Oh!
{41132}{41213}- Yeah, I swear to God. Swear to God.|- Wow.
{41216}{41306}So now she's crying.|I'm crying.
{41309}{41422}We're both kinda crying, but not|the kind of crying that's like...
{41425}{41500}But the kind of crying that's|like we're trying not to cry.
{41503}{41602}Do you know what I mean? Like we're not|trying to... Whatever. It was very cool.
{41603}{41685}So I finished reading with her.
{41686}{41770}I finally hold up my finger,|like give me a minute here.
{41773}{41830}- Right.|- Like give me a minute.
{41833}{41935}More than that, 'cause I'm in it.|But like I'm broke.
{41938}{42061}Give me a second here.|May I have a minute?
{42064}{42187}So I put down my head,|and the whole room sits in silence...
{42190}{42247}for at least five minutes.
{42250}{42306}- Swear to God, five minutes.|- Whoa!
{42309}{42377}I look up, everyone|rips up in applause.
{42378}{42491}The whole room is rip-roaring clapping|it up for me, for big T, right?
{42492}{42633}Everyone in the room is sitting|there tearing their face.|They're crying their eyes out.
{42634}{42732}The guy working the camera, you know,|just filming it? Got tears in his eyes.
{42733}{42821}- Not the camera guy.|- I swear to God, the camera guy.
{42822}{42915}Not so much from my reading,|although it had a lot to do with it,
{42918}{42981}but, really, he had|his own things going on.
{42984}{43059}So the producer|starts to talk to me.
{43062}{43143}He says, "Trent, when you|walked in this room,
{43146}{43230}I didn't see Trent Walker|come in here. "
{43233}{43328}He said, "I saw big brother|come in here. " Fuckin' great, right?
{43331}{43409}He says, "You walked in with the role,|you nailed it, you're great. "
{43410}{43495}- So give me the fuckin' part.|- Exactly. Right?
{43496}{43643}Then he says to me... He says,|"Trent, I gotta be honest with you.
{43646}{43769}I think that it might be that|you may be just a little bit old...
{43772}{43846}for the role of brother. "
{43847}{43924}So I felt confident,|'cause I gave a good read.
{43924}{44014}I say to him, "Well, how old exactly|is the role of brother?"
{44015}{44074}- Here it comes.|- 'Cause I'm tall.
{44077}{44149}- Here it comes.|- But I look young, Mike.|Do I look young, girls?
{44152}{44212}Yeah, you do.
{44215}{44301}So he says to me... I swear to God he|says this to me with a straight face.
{44304}{44430}This fucking guy.|"Eleven years old. "
{44433}{44489}- And you said "double down. "|- Double down.
{44490}{44562}Because you know why? Because you|make it happen on the bets.
{44565}{44622}He's great, isn't he?
{44625}{44727}But the truth of the matter was,|you saw my picture, you saw my tape.
{44730}{44814}You know I'm 24 years old.|Why did you call me in?
{44817}{44898}- Wow.|- That's your great bit.
{44899}{45012}Well, we all have stories.
{45015}{45072}- Wow.|- Yup.
{45299}{45458}Uh, how rude of me. I never...|I never gave you the... the tour.
{46106}{46243}Come on home, girl|He said with a smile
{46246}{46375}You don't have to love me|and let's get high a while
{46378}{46522}But try to understand|Try to understand
{46523}{46615}- Ohh|- I'm gonna check on my boy.
{46616}{46716}Ohh, try
{46717}{46780}Try to understand
{46783}{46906}Try, try|Try to understand
{46909}{46990}He's a magic man
{47169}{47229}I'm sure she'll call.
{47232}{47298}I mean, six years|is a long time.
{47301}{47394}- You don't just break it off|cleanly after six years.|- But she did.
{47397}{47484}- And she's with somebody else now.|- Already?
{47487}{47580}- Yeah.|- Oh, you poor thing.
{47583}{47664}- You know what? It won't last.|- Why not?
{47667}{47784}- It's a rebound.|- We were a rebound|and we lasted for six years.
{47787}{47943}Well, yeah, but how long was the|relationship she was rebounding from?
{47946}{48024}Six years.
{48027}{48098}Uh, can I check|my messages real quick?
{48101}{48188}- I have a calling card.|It won't cost anything.|- Yeah.
{48191}{48260}- Are you sure?|- Yeah, sure. The phone's in the back.
{48261}{48335}- I'm not ruining tonight, am I?|- No, it's okay.
{48336}{48398}- Are you sure?|- Yeah. Oh, I understand.
{48401}{48458}- I'm sorry.|- It's okay.
{48688}{48745}T.
{48778}{48835}Trent.
{48886}{48973}Trent.
{48976}{49055}I need to, uh, u...
{49056}{49212}No. I gotta... I gotta use...|I gotta use the phone.
{49215}{49338}- You can check 'em tomorrow.|- I need to use the phone.
{49341}{49425}Okay? I'm sorry.
{49428}{49485}Hold on.
{49566}{49660}I'm sure I... They weren't|in there that long.
{49662}{49755}I don't think we're|interrupting anything.
{49962}{50020}I have a calling card.
{50021}{50135}So it's a 800...|it's a 800 number.
{50546}{50663}- Six years? Oh, poor thing.|- I know.
{50666}{50723}- And you know what he said?|- What? What?
{50726}{50783}- And I believe him.|- What?
{50786}{50903}- He said, "I just want her to be happy. "|- He said that?
{50906}{50989}- It's so sweet. So sweet.|- That is so sweet.
{50992}{51063}- Oh.|- I know.
{51064}{51154}I'll make some coffee.
{51157}{51238}Mmm.
{51859}{51913}Did she call?
{51957}{52077}- Oh!|- Oh, Mike, I'm so...
{52080}{52161}Oh, God.
{52164}{52272}That's so bad. I'm sorry.
{52308}{52401}It's gonna be okay.
{52404}{52527}She asked me what I was thinking about.|Did you want me to lie?
{52530}{52608}You didn't have to|get into it, baby.
{52609}{52686}I'm sorry about|interrupting you guys.
{52689}{52794}Oh, don't worry about it. I just wanted|you to have a good time, that's all.
{52797}{52913}- Christy was nice.|- Yeah, I really didn't like|her that much, to be honest.
{52916}{53033}- Why not?|- I don't know, man. She just...|She didn't really do it for me.
{53036}{53185}What'd you think of that,|uh, Dorothy girl?
{53186}{53276}The whole Judy Garland thing|kinda turned me on.
{53279}{53387}- Does that make me some kind of a fag?|- No, baby, you're money.
{53495}{53597}- I don't think she liked me anyway.|- Mike, I'm tellin' you, man.
{53599}{53691}- She thought you were money.|- I don't think so.
{53692}{53785}I heard 'em both talking.|Both those girls thought you were money.
{53788}{53865}You're a good friend.
{53907}{53994}Look, you take yourself|outta the game.
{53997}{54075}You start talkin' to 'em|about puppy dogs and ice cream,
{54078}{54174}of course it's going to end up|on the friendship tip.
{54177}{54234}I just don't think|she liked me in that way.
{54237}{54318}Baby, you are so money,|and you don't even know it.
{54321}{54456}Look, T, the girls don't go for me|the way they go for you, okay?
{54459}{54530}- Michelle went for you, right?|- That's different.
{54531}{54621}- Why? How is that different?|- We were younger. It was college.
{54624}{54711}You didn't go to college.|You don't know how it is.|The girls are young, they drink.
{54714}{54830}- They don't know any better.|- Do you know how stupid that sounds?
{54833}{54980}Listen to me. Your self-esteem|is low right now because|she's with somebody else.
{54983}{55094}But talkin' about it and thinkin' about|it all the time, it's depressing.
{55097}{55202}It's no good, man.
{55205}{55262}I just need|a little more time.
{55265}{55358}Why, so you can sit around your stuffy|apartment beating yourself up over it?
{55361}{55475}- Remember the first week|after she told you?|- Don't remind me.
{55476}{55598}Huh? Couldn't even|leave your place.
{55601}{55694}You know, you just sat around|your stuffy apartment,
{55697}{55810}sitting there, drinking orange juice,|feeling sorry for yourself.
{55813}{55912}Now look at you, man. Right?|I mean, you got a part in a movie.
{55915}{55993}- A day.|- Whatever, Mike.|It's work. You understand?
{55996}{56125}You're doing what you love to do.|What the hell is she doing now?
{56128}{56218}Selling scrap metal.
{56221}{56320}Okay. And this guy she's seeing,|what the hell does he do?
{56323}{56398}- He drives a carriage.|- What?
{56401}{56506}I heard he drives a carriage|around Central Park or something.
{56509}{56626}Oh, Mike, please! You're|the fun-lovin', outgoing party guy,
{56629}{56672}and you're sweatin'|some lawn jockey.
{56674}{56716}and you're sweatin'|some lawn jockey.
{56719}{56807}Jesus Christ!|I'm tellin' you, man.
{56808}{56922}You're better off without this girl.|You gotta trust me on this, Mike.
{56923}{57027}- All right, buddy?|- Stop talking. Shut up.
{57030}{57156}Okay, I'm gonna try. I promise you I|will shut up if you shut the hell up.
{57159}{57246}- We're gonna make this work.|- You're damn right you're gonna try.
{57249}{57333}Let's get home.
{57336}{57462}- I'm a man of means by no means|- Los Angeles.
{57465}{57533}King of the road
{57534}{57675}I know every engineer|of every train
{57678}{57776}All their children|and all of their names
{57777}{57898}And every handout|in every town
{57899}{58010}Every lock that ain't locked|when no one's around
{58016}{58103}I seen trailers|for sale or rent
{58106}{58178}- I don't think|I'm gonna take it.|- Look, it's a gig.
{58179}{58237}This is definitely|a step back for me.
{58238}{58313}There's not much of a call|for Shakespeare in this town.
{58314}{58387}There's just something|about being Goofy, all right?
{58387}{58497}Any other Disney character would|be fine. Mickey? Mickey's an icon.
{58498}{58606}- Why does it have to be Goofy?|- What do you want? You're tall.
{58609}{58685}How am I gonna|tell my parents?
{58686}{58767}I still haven't told them|I didn't get the series.
{58770}{58845}You tested over a month ago.|I'm sure they figured it out.
{58848}{58956}It's like, "Mom, hi.|I didn't get that pilot.
{58957}{59067}By the way, I'm Goofy.|Send more money. "
{59654}{59711}Hey, Rob.
{59753}{59845}You notice I didn't|mention her once today.
{59846}{59956}- I didn't want to say anything.|- Oh, yeah? Why?
{59957}{60071}Ah, it's kind of like|not talking to your pitcher|in the middle of a no-hitter.
{60074}{60176}- What do you mean? Like you|didn't want to jinx it?|- Kinda.
{60179}{60254}I don't talk about her that much.
{60257}{60329}- I didn't mention her once today.|- Tend the pin.
{60332}{60425}The only reason I mentioned her|at all was to tell you I'm not|gonna talk about her anymore.
{60426}{60506}- I thought you'd appreciate that.|- I do. Good for you, Mikey.
{60604}{60678}- Get there.|- Play it out.
{60679}{60790}- I decided to get back out there.|- Good. Glad to hear it.
{60793}{60898}- Can't make any more excuses for myself.|- Excellent.
{60952}{61044}Do you wanna hit the town tonight?
{61045}{61135}Uh, I shouldn't.|It's a weeknight.
{61138}{61279}- You got a Pluto callback?|- Yeah, kick me when I'm down.
{61282}{61369}- All right. Count 'em up.|- How many strokes?
{61372}{61441}One, two, three...
{61572}{61631}- Eight, nine.|- What'd you get?
{61632}{61707}- Eight or a nine.|- I'll give you an eight.
{61708}{61778}- What did you get?|- I got an eight.
{61779}{61881}Dead heat after one hole.|It's turning into quite a rivalry.
{61884}{61989}You better replace the pin, Chi Chi.|The natives look restless.
{62040}{62106}You bitch! You bitch!

{68523}{68628}To grab a drink before we meet|the guys for a bite at 11:00.
{68631}{68688}Where is this place?
{68691}{68805}For some reason the cool bars|in Hollywood have to be hard|to find and have no sign.
{68808}{68886}It's kind of like a speakeasy|kind of thing. It's kinda cool.
{68889}{68973}It's like you're in on some|kind of secret, you know?
{68976}{69096}You tell a chick you been|someplace, it's like braggin'|that you know how to find it.
{69539}{69620}Excuse me.

{70085}{70189}God, I can't believe|the women in this city.

{70307}{70367}come to our gene pool.
{70368}{70425}Darwinism at its best.
{70426}{70516}- Yo, Mikey, what's up?|- Charles! How you doin', man?
{70519}{70593}- Ah, you know, man. You know.|- You get that pilot?

{71286}{71379}That's all right, man.|I still haven't told my folks|I didn't get Deep Space Nine.
{71382}{71439}You figure they'd figure|it out by now, right?
{71442}{71511}- But Moms keeps asking me.|- Boy, does it hurt when they ask.
{71514}{71580}I don't even tell them about|anything I'm close on anymore.
{71583}{71649}Not 'til you book it.|You know, you might get cut out.
{71652}{71760}I'm considering taking|a part as Goofy.
{71763}{71850}- Well, at least it's Disney, right?|- Yeah.
{71853}{71943}Look, we're going to, uh,|we're going to this party in the hills.
{71946}{72039}Some modeling agency. Beautiful babies.|You want to come with?
{72040}{72119}Yeah, why not?|This place is dead anyway.
{72122}{72188}Let's go.
{72296}{72364}No, no, no, no, no.|Now, you got to admit...
{72365}{72440}that the Steadicam shot|in GoodFellas was the money.
{72443}{72544}The basement of the... the restaurant,|the Copa in New York.
{72545}{72635}- Through the kitchen, Mike.|- I heard it took them four days|to light that shot.
{72636}{72694}Four days?|I don't know about four days.
{72695}{72758}- Well, that's what I heard.|- They have|to hide all the lights.
{72761}{72818}Jesus, that must've|cost a fortune.
{72821}{72908}That's nothing.|You know how much money my man|spent on that Vegas movie?
{72910}{72967}Wait. You gotta be nuts|to shoot in a casino.
{72970}{73033}All right, ready. Mean Streets?
{73036}{73128}- That's the dope.|- Dude, dude. Reservoir Dogs.
{73131}{73191}- Oh, stop with that|fucking Reservoir Dogs.|- Which one?
{73194}{73272}The one right in the beginning where|they're walking in slow motion, man.
{73275}{73338}How can you even|compare the two, man?
{73341}{73419}Tarantino completely bites|everything from Scorsese.
{73420}{73478}- It's true.|- He's derivative.
{73479}{73548}You know what?|You gotta admit that did look money.
{73551}{73641}I heard they did|that whole thing for under ten grand.
{73644}{73707}I don't know what the big deal is.|Everybody steals from everybody.|That's movies.
{73710}{73773}Let's get the hell out|of here if we wanna make this party.

{94064}{94142}- It was about two weeks ago.|- It was probably more.
{94145}{94225}Probably longer, 'cause things|have been going very well lately.
{94228}{94285}I haven't been looking|for a job in a while.
{94288}{94372}It could have been someone who|looks like me, 'cause there's|a lot of people who look kinda...
{94373}{94483}- See, I have a face that's similar...|- You better pay the man.
{94486}{94609}Here's the, uh...|Here's... Just take this.
{94612}{94705}I've been doing very well.|Thank you. Uh, thank you...
{94706}{94777}- Nikki.|- Nikki. Thank you, Nikki.
{94778}{94837}Mm-hmm.
{94921}{95008}- We got digits, baby.|- Yeah, what a surprise.
{95011}{95086}What's wrong with you? I saw you|talkin' to a beautiful brunette baby.
{95089}{95161}She didn't like me, okay?|I made a fool of myself.
{95164}{95265}- Baby, don't talk that way.|- You're so money, and you|don't even know it.
{95268}{95373}- That's what I keep tryin' to tell him.|- Could you not mess with me?
{95376}{95462}- Baby, we're not messing with you.|- We're not.
{95463}{95565}You know what you are? You're like|a big bear with claws and fangs, man.
{95566}{95643}- Big fuckin' teeth, man.|- Yeah, big fuckin' teeth on ya.
{95646}{95745}She's just like this little bunny who's|just kinda cowering in the corner.
{95746}{95834}- Shivering.|- Yeah, man, just kinda...
{95835}{95925}You got these claws and|you're staring at these claws,|and you're thinkin' to yourself,
{95926}{96006}with these claws, you're thinkin', "How|am I supposed to kill this bunny?"
{96009}{96066}You're pokin' at it, man.
{96069}{96146}You're not hurtin' it. You're just|kinda gently battin' the bunny around.
{96152}{96225}You know what I mean?|And the bunny's scared of you.
{96227}{96298}- And it's shivering.|- You got the fucking claws!
{96299}{96404}These claws and these fangs! You're|looking at your claws and your fangs.
{96407}{96484}You're thinking to yourself,|"I don't know what to do, man.
{96485}{96599}I don't know how to kill the bunny. "|With this, you don't know how|to kill the bunny!
{96602}{96679}You're like|a big bear, man.
{96680}{96764}- So you're not just fuckin' with me?|- No, I'm not fucking with you!
{96767}{96824}- Honestly!|- Mike, I'm telling you, you're money.
{96827}{96884}You're so fucking money.
{96887}{96953}I want you to go over to that girl|and I want you to get those digits.
{96956}{97013}- You're money.|- Come here a second. Listen to me.
{97015}{97093}Look it, when you go up|to talk to her, man,
{97096}{97248}I don't want you to be the guy|in the PG-13 movie everyone's|really hoping makes it happen.
{97251}{97341}I want you to be like the guy|in the rated R movie, you know?
{97344}{97416}The guy you're not sure|whether or not you like yet.
{97419}{97491}You're not sure where he's coming|from, okay? You're a bad man.
{97494}{97560}You're a bad man.|You're a bad man.
{97563}{97629}Bad man.
{98786}{98858}All right, all right.
{98909}{98984}See, baby,|it's not that hard.
{98987}{99055}- 818?|- 310.
{99058}{99121}Nice.
{99124}{99196}- So how long do I wait to call?|- A day.
{99199}{99271}- Tomorrow.|- Mm-mmm.
{99274}{99331}- Tomorrow, then a day.|- Yeah.
{99334}{99424}- So two days.|- Yeah, I guess you could|call it that... two days.
{99427}{99499}Definitely. Two days|is like industry standard.
{99502}{99640}I used to wait two days to|call anybody, but now it's like|everyone in town waits two days.
{99643}{99703}So I think three days is kinda money.|What do you think?
{99706}{99790}- Two's enough not to look anxious.|- Two's enough not to look anxious.
{99791}{99856}But I think three days|is kinda money.
{99859}{99916}Maybe I'll wait three weeks.|How's that?
{99919}{99987}And tell her I was cleaning out|my wallet and I just happened|to run into her number.
{99990}{100047}- Then ask her where you met her.|- Yeah.
{100050}{100134}I don't remember. What does she look|like? Then I'll ask if we fucked.
{100137}{100203}Would that...|T, would that be the money?
{100206}{100269}You know what? Ha, ha, ha, Mike.|Laugh all you want.
{100272}{100431}But if you call too soon,|you might scare off a nice baby|who's ready to party.
{100434}{100563}- How long are you guys gonna|wait to call your babies?|- Six days.
{100566}{100704}Different, I don't know,|schools of philosophy, they|all can fight each other.
{100767}{100869}- I think I like this town.|- No, no, gotta go to New Orleans.
{100872}{100929}Hey, how're you doin'?
{100967}{101036}Watch where you're going, asshole.
{101039}{101096}What'd you say, bitch?
{101174}{101258}I said watch where|you're going, bitch.
{101261}{101372}- Oh, so you want something.|- Hey, fucker. Hey.
{101375}{101443}- Fuck him up.|- Smack that fuckin' bitch.
{101444}{101525}- Yeah, motherfucker.|- You got a fucking problem|with me, bitch?
{101528}{101615}Come on! Yeah, I got|a fuckin' problem, motherfucker!
{101618}{101699}- Yeah, come on!|- You're the fuckin' bitch, baby!
{101702}{101804}- Come on, bitch.|You little fuckin' pussy!|- Come on, punk, do it.

{101866}{101985}- Hey, you're a fuckin' bitch!|You're a fuckin' bitch!|- You wanna go?
{101986}{102072}I'll show you who|the fucking bitch is!
{102073}{102138}Huh?
{102141}{102234}You're the fucking bitch!
{102237}{102312}Motherfucker!
{102510}{102612}- What the fuck?|- You asshole! Didn't you|see Boyz N the Hood?
{102615}{102705}- Now one of us is gonna get shot.|- He ain't gonna do anything.
{102708}{102779}- You fuckin' asshole.|- What a fuckin' dick.
{102780}{102878}What the fuck did you want me to do,|back down? He called me a bitch.
{102880}{102977}- We kept our rep, bro.|- Fuck rep, man. I got|a callback tomorrow.
{102980}{103049}Yeah, I gotta get up|early tomorrow.
{103115}{103256}What the fuck are you carrying|a gun for? In case somebody|steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
{103259}{103319}Hey, man, you're not from here.|You don't know how it is.
{103322}{103385}- I grew up in L.A.|- Anaheim.
{103388}{103497}Whatever, man. It's different out here.|It's not like New York, Mikey.
{103499}{103608}Fuckin' A right, it's not like New York.|Out here you can avoid trouble.
{103610}{103718}It's not like you live in Compton, Sue,|with bullets whizzing by your head.
{103721}{103817}You live in a good neighborhood, man.|In New York trouble finds you.
{103820}{103930}- People get carjacked.|- Oh, man, who would ever|carjack your fuckin' K car?
{103933}{103999}He's right, Sue.|You don't need to carry a gat.
{104002}{104074}Just 'cause I had the balls|to stand up to these guys...
{104077}{104170}Like fuckin' House of Pain|was gonna do anything?
{104171}{104263}- You like in this fucking fantasy world.|- Wha...
{104266}{104356}What about you, Mikey?|At least I fuckin' have balls, man.
{104359}{104476}You're always whining about some bitch|that left you a year ago!
{104479}{104554}It was six months ago,|and she didn't leave me.
{104557}{104650}Whatever, man! You're like|a fuckin' little whiny bitch, man.
{104653}{104740}Oh, whoopee, you got a number tonight?|You're gonna fuck it up.
{104743}{104873}- Hey, Sue.|- No. Have you gotten laid once|since you moved out here?
{104874}{104967}- Have you fucked once?|- Why don't you shut the fuck up|for a little bit?
{104970}{105042}I know for a fact that you haven't.|You know how I know?
{105045}{105138}- 'Cause you never shut up about it!|- Shut the fuck up, Sue!
{105141}{105225}- Ah, he's fuckin' right.|- Shut up! Hey, Mike, come here.
{105228}{105321}Mike, come back here!|Mike, come back here!
{105324}{105408}- He was fuckin' pissing me off!|- Just shut the fuck up.
{105411}{105519}Just shut the fuck up. I don't even|want to fuckin' talk to you right now.

{109013}{109087}Hi, uh, Nikki,|this is Mike again.
{109090}{109177}I just called 'cause it sounded like|your machine might've cut me off...
{109180}{109267}when, uh, when I... before I finished|leaving my number.
{109270}{109366}Anyway, uh... And also, uh,|sorry to call so late,
{109369}{109486}but you were still at the Dresden when|I left, so I knew I'd get your machine.
{109489}{109564}Anyhow, uh, uh,|my number's 2-1...
{109803}{109884}Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.
{109887}{110004}213-555-4679. That's it.|Just wanna leave my number.
{110007}{110109}I didn't want you to think|I was weird or desperate or...
{110145}{110202}We should just,|uh, hang out...
{110205}{110262}and, uh, see where it goes.
{110265}{110352}'Cause it's nice and, uh,|you know, no expectations.
{110355}{110442}So, okay?|Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.
{110882}{110956}Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.
{110957}{111031}I just got out of a six-year|relationship, okay?
{111032}{111152}That should help explain|why I'm acting so weird.|I just wanted you to know that.
{111155}{111242}It's not you, it's me.|I'm sorry.
{111314}{111365}This is Mike.

{111798}{111885}I'm gonna be up for a while and|I'd rather speak to you in person...
{111888}{111957}instead of trying to fit it all into...
{111958}{112023}Fuck!
{112251}{112347}Hi, this is Nikki. Leave a message.
{112392}{112455}Uh, Nikki? M-Mike.
{112499}{112559}It's, uh, uh...|It's just, uh...
{112562}{112619}This just isn't working out.
{112622}{112723}I- I think you're great,|but, uh, I-I...
{112724}{112820}Maybe we should just take|some time off from each other.
{112821}{112940}It's not you, it's me.|It's what I'm going through.
{112941}{113014}All right? Uh, i-i-it's, it...
{113015}{113105}It's only been six months...
{113108}{113186}- Mike?|- Nikki! Great!
{113189}{113303}D- Did you just walk in,|or were you listening all along?
{113306}{113391}Don't ever call me again.
{113392}{113476}Wow. I-I guess you're home.
{114118}{114196}Hey, this is Mike.|Leave a message after the beep.
{114259}{114368}Hey, Mikey, it's Trent.|You home? You there?
{114369}{114476}All right, man,|I guess you're not home.
{114477}{114570}Why don't you come out tonight, Mikey?|I haven't seen you for two days.
{114571}{114647}We're gonna play hockey|at Sue's house until 10:30,
{114648}{114738}and then we're either going to|the Lava Lounge for Sinatra Night...
{114739}{114829}or we'll be at the Derby|for Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
{114830}{114917}We might also check out|Swing Night at the El Rey.
{114918}{115007}And if we're not there we'll be|at the Three of Clubs, all right?
{115008}{115128}Otherwise we'll be at the Dresden Room,|so come on out and meet up with us.
{115131}{115206}See you soon, gorgeous.
{116799}{116904}Hey, this is Mike. Leave a message|after the beep.
{116905}{116963}Mikey, it's Rob.|I'm downstairs.
{116964}{117057}Come on, pick it up|and buzz me in, buddy.
{117058}{117117}Come on, open up.
{117932}{117989}Thanks, man.
{118133}{118193}You eat anything today?
{118396}{118455}Yesterday?
{118456}{118522}You haven't been drinking,|have you?
{118972}{119110}- Sorry about what happened|at the Dresden, man.|- Oh, don't worry about it, man.
{119113}{119200}It's like, now I have my L.A. gun story.
{119203}{119337}You should hear the way I tell it|to the guys back home... it's an Uzi.
{119496}{119601}- You wanna talk about it?|- What's the point?
{119799}{119889}Hey, it's been two days.|You should call that Nikki girl.
{120000}{120051}Not your type.
{120156}{120242}I'm thinking of|moving back East.
{120305}{120392}- Well, that's dumb.|- What's so dumb about it?
{120395}{120482}You're doing really well|out here, Mike.
{120485}{120542}How well am I doin'?
{120545}{120647}I host an open mike;|I play a fuckin' bus driver in a movie.
{120650}{120707}Big fuckin' deal.
{120710}{120782}I got an agent|that specializes in magicians.
{120785}{120842}How good am I doin'?
{120845}{120926}Did you get turned down|for Goofy?
{120929}{120986}They turned you down?
{120989}{121121}Yeah, they went with somebody who had|some more theme park experience.
{121124}{121186}I killed for that job.
{121188}{121317}The point is, Mike, it all depends|on how you look at it. All right?
{121320}{121446}You're telling me that your life sucks.|That means mine is god-awful.
{121449}{121554}Part of the reason I moved out here|is I saw how well you were doing,
{121557}{121644}and I figured if you could|make it, I could too.
{121647}{121764}- I didn't make it.|- You got an agent.|You got in the unions.
{121767}{121851}You know, that's your problem,|is that you...
{121884}{121974}You don't look at|the things that you have.
{121975}{122064}You only look at the stuff|you don't have.
{122067}{122138}Those guys are right about you.|You're money.
{122174}{122258}Then why won't she call?
{122327}{122387}She won't call|because you left.
{122435}{122534}She's got her own life to deal with,|man, and that's in New York.
{122537}{122624}She's a sweet girl|and I love her to pieces,
{122627}{122714}but fuck her, man...|you gotta get on with your life.
{122717}{122873}You gotta let go of the past, and Mikey,|when you do the future is beautiful.
{122876}{122942}All right?|Look out the window.
{122945}{123064}It's sunny every day here.|It's like manifest destiny.
{123067}{123214}Don't tell me we didn't make it.|We made it. We are here.
{123217}{123304}Everything that is past|is prologue to this.
{123307}{123394}All of the shit that|didn't kill us is only...
{123397}{123463}Ah, you know.|All that shit.
{123502}{123565}You're gonna get over it.
{123667}{123763}How did you get over it?|How long did it take?
{123793}{123898}I don't know.|Sometimes it still hurts.
{123901}{123969}You know how it is, man.|It's like...
{123970}{124062}You wake up every day,|it hurts a little bit less,
{124064}{124155}then you wake up one day|and it doesn't hurt at all.
{124158}{124214}And the funny thing is...
{124215}{124305}This is kinda weird,|but it's like...
{124335}{124395}you almost miss that pain.
{124572}{124635}You miss the pain?
{124680}{124776}Yeah, for the same reason|that you miss her.
{124779}{124866}Because you... you lived|with it for so long.
{125042}{125111}Let's go get|something to eat.
{125114}{125180}All right. Sure.
{125183}{125240}You look like shit.
{125411}{125483}Mikey! What's up, man?
{125486}{125543}You wanna play again, motherfucker?
{125546}{125618}I'm glad you came out tonight.|It's good to see you.
{125621}{125690}- You're my problem,|you bitch motherfucker!|- Come on in.
{125693}{125750}- Come on, bitch!|- You want some?
{125753}{125816}- Hey, guys! Mikey's here!|- What's up, Mikey?
{125819}{125906}What's up, baby?
{125909}{126007}- Oh, so you want some? You want some?|- You ain't shit!
{126009}{126111}Roll up, bitch! Roll up!|Roll. That's right.
{126114}{126188}You run. You run, baby.
{126189}{126267}Blast him!|Come on, hit him!
{126270}{126327}- All right.|- Okay, bitch.
{126330}{126387}- You ready, hip hop?|- Uh-huh.
{126390}{126468}- Come on, man! Let's move it up!|- Hey, man.
{126471}{126534}What are they doing here?
{126537}{126594}Oh, no, no,|it's totally cool, man.
{126597}{126675}We saw 'em that night at Roscoe's.|Trent cleared it up.
{126678}{126765}I apologized, bought 'em some|chicken and waffles. It's totally fine.
{126768}{126870}They fuckin' love T, man.|That boy can talk.
{126971}{127022}More important, man,
{127025}{127082}I'm sorry about what I said.
{127085}{127190}I was out of line. I was drunk,|my adrenalin was goin'.
{127193}{127277}Yeah, you know, whatever.|I needed a good kick in the ass.
{127280}{127409}It was a... I don't know. We're better|friends for it. All right?
{127412}{127489}All right, man.
{127490}{127553}- Roll up, bitch! Roll!|- Come on, let's see it!
{127556}{127619}- Thanks, man.|- Get off me!
{127622}{127711}I been hatin' myself|for the last few days.
{127712}{127835}- That's all right.|I keep it in the zone.|- Look, I know what that's like.
{127836}{127925}- Come on, Superman.|- You watchin', New Kids On The Block?
{127926}{128023}- Yo, Double Down, what time we leaving?|- Five minutes, baby.
{128024}{128119}Hey, Mikey, you should call that|girl Nikki. It's been two days.
{128122}{128209}See if she wants to|meet you there.

{140488}{140638}If you meet a girl in a bar and|talk to her, you don't have to|worry if anybody's watching you.
{140640}{140696}What else?
{140697}{140772}What? You can do|whatever you want, you know.
{140773}{140865}You grow, go out, anything.
{140868}{140964}Like, if I met a handsome|young man at a bar,
{140967}{141036}I could just ask him to dance?
{141039}{141132}If the guy wanted to, yeah.
{141135}{141192}You don't think|he would want to?
{141195}{141341}Oh, yeah... No, I mean, he would|want to with you. Sure. I mean, if he...
{141344}{141449}Sure. M-M-Maybe it's just that|he doesn't feel like dancing.

{149786}{149882}No, when I, uh, I lived in|New York they made it sound...

{150029}{150118}I been here six months,|all I got to show for it is black lung.
{150318}{150420}Didn't you tell me that|I should be patient with my career?

{155187}{155274}Shh! You know what?|I have it under control. Okay?
{155277}{155334}He has it under control.

{161429}{161501}Do you know how hard it is|to not call you?
{161504}{161605}I mean, I pick up the phone every night,|whenever that commercial comes on.
{161608}{161722}- The Michelin commercial?|- Yeah, you know, the one|with the baby in the tire.
{161725}{161821}- One time I started to cry|right in front of Pierre.|- Pierre?

{162894}{163026}Um, well, I'm going out of town|for a week and the cab's on its way.
{163029}{163095}Can't you just talk to me|for five minutes?
{163098}{163170}Look, there's somebody holding on the|other line. I have to take this call.
{163173}{163269}I really want to catch up with you,|but, um, I have to take the call.

{163706}{163802}- I would've called you back.|- No, that's okay.|I wanted to talk to you.
{163803}{163876}You know, I really could...|could've called you back, but...
{163877}{163979}Anyway, I probably should have waited|two days. That's what my friends said.
{163982}{164063}But... God, I sound like|such a schoolgirl. It's just,|they have this thing, okay?
{164066}{164123}It's at The Room.|It's Sinatra's birthday.
{164126}{164231}And it's one of these Hollywood clubs|and there's no sign.
{164234}{164321}Uh, I don't understand why...|why they don't have any signs.
{164322}{164394}It's just|I'm really bad at this.
{164395}{164530}I just want to know|if you might want to go with me.
{164596}{164695}- So, uh, you|hung up on which one?|- Michelle.
{164695}{164769}- You hung up with your girlfriend.|- Ex.
{164772}{164841}- Oh, now she's your ex.|- She was always my ex.

{164955}{165093}- You hung up with her?|- I wanted to take the other call.
{165096}{165171}- What'd she say when|you called her back?|- I didn't.
{165255}{165362}- You didn't call her back?|- No.
{165365}{165491}- Why not, Mike?|- It didn't occur to me.
{165545}{165602}Didn't occur to you.
{165605}{165683}It didn't.
{165686}{165830}You been, uh, tearing yourself|up about this girl for six months.
{165860}{165920}Didn't occur to you?
{165971}{166043}No.
{166115}{166199}Well, Michael, I'll bite.
{166277}{166419}You know, man, I didn't understand|it either. It's all so hard.
{166420}{166522}Then it hit me on the way over here,|you know, like a ton of bricks.
{166523}{166581}It's just so simple.
{166582}{166660}- When you...|- Dude, dude, wait a second.
{166786}{166876}I'm getting vibe like|in a really weird way here.
{166930}{167026}This girl's looking at me|like she knows me a little bit.
{167027}{167088}- You don't recognize her?|- Mike, I don't know.
{167089}{167182}I could've been out with Sue|one night drinking and told her|I was a race car driver.
{167185}{167292}No, I think I would|remember this girl.
{167295}{167427}I don't think I've ever met her before.|I would definitely remember this one.
{167428}{167544}She got a lot of confidence, man.|She's doing like...
{167545}{167649}- Wow.|- What's going...
{167652}{167720}Mike, stop, stop.|Stop, all right? Just stop.
{167721}{167793}She's playing a little game,|like a fun thing with me.

{171644}{171749}And I never went in|for afterglow
{171752}{171865}Or candlelight|on the mistletoe
{171866}{171959}But now when you turn|the lamp down low
{171962}{172063}I'm beginnin'|to see the light
{172064}{172192}You know, I used to ramble|through the park
{172195}{172300}Shadowboxin' in the dark
{172303}{172393}Then you came|and lit that spark
{172396}{172486}That's a four-alarm fire now

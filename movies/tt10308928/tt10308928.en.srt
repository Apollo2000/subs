3
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:20,623
Follow me.

4
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,852
Come on, you...

5
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:51,453
Can't get a shot.

6
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:12,975
Come on...
Come on.

7
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:42,304
<i>There's a storm right now.</i>

8
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:45,708
<i>A hundred and sixty
miles per hour.</i>

9
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:48,945
<i>And we still
have gusts around 190.</i>

10
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:54,416
<i>So this area, this territory,
is certainly very much in danger.</i>

11
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:58,755
<i>Fifteen inches of rainfall possible
across parts of Puerto Rico.</i>

12
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:01,924
<i>And life-threatening mudslides</i>

13
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,660
<i>and really more flash flooding.</i>

14
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:08,731
<i>This is where we will see
the storm surge, storm winds...</i>

15
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,769
<i>There will certainly be damage.</i>

16
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:12,427
<i>The entire territory will
be absolutely under the control</i>

17
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,398
<i>of this category four,
maybe category five storm.</i>

18
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,636
Shh.
You got something we want.

19
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,981
Walk normal.

20
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:33,583
You walk normal.

21
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:35,852
If you say anything
I'll shoot you

22
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,452
and the person next to you.

23
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:41,556
How can I help you?

24
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:44,727
Thank you.

25
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,878
He... he wouldn't even
tell me his name.

26
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:03,713
It was... it was arranged
through a third-party.

27
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,581
- I don't know anything...
- Calm down, calm down.

28
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:06,649
It's okay.

29
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:11,921
What's the address?

30
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,863
<i>Here's Puerto Rico: 3.5
million Americans live there.</i>

31
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:23,666
<i>And here it comes,
right along the shore.</i>

32
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,102
<i>But San Juan is still
going to have winds</i>

33
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:28,871
<i>of 130 to 140 miles an hour.</i>

34
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:30,806
<i>There will be weeks
without power.</i>

35
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,541
<i>There may be weeks
without water.</i>

36
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:35,811
I need to sit.

37
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,479
I need...
Please, I need to...

38
00:05:37,512 --> 00:05:39,081
John. John.

39
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:51,493
Let's go.

40
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:53,029
Where's Babie?

41
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,997
The old prune panicked.

42
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:56,632
Babie was aborted.

43
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,801
Come on. Let's go.

44
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,333
Whoo.

45
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:45,000
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey.

46
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:48,104
Cardillo, I need the keys
to the prisoner holding cell.

47
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:51,173
Yes, sir.
There you go.

48
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:52,908
Mom make bail?

49
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,112
Cardillo!

50
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:58,814
- Wow. Yeah?
- This is Officer Pena.

51
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:00,216
She'll be assisting
with the evacs.

52
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,852
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

53
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,720
The two of you
will take the van.

54
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,989
You'll be scouring
every last motherfucking inch

55
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:08,724
- for anybody that's left.
- But...

56
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,326
You find 'em, you take 'em
to the safety shelters.

57
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,928
- I'm really looking forward to...
- That's not my job.

58
00:09:12,962 --> 00:09:16,432
It is today.
Get your ass out there.

59
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:17,867
Good luck.

60
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,652
Okay. I'll wait for you outside.

61
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:42,825
Fuck.

62
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:49,331
Hey.

63
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:51,800
We're going to get you
those burgers, huh?

64
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:02,711
Hey, man. Do you mind
leaving some for the rest of us?

65
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,281
Excuse me?

66
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,849
You took all the meat.

67
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,386
Oh, God.

68
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:15,791
Come on, man.
Need just some meat for my kid.

69
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:18,460
What do you wanna do, man, huh?

70
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:20,329
You wanna fight me
in front of your kid?

71
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:25,834
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

72
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:27,970
That man just grabbed
a pack of ground beef

73
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,271
right out of my son's hand.

74
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:30,739
What?
What are you talking about?

75
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:34,009
What?

76
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:37,846
Sir, I'm gonna have to take
your cart and ask you to leave.

77
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:46,255
Whoa, whoa!

78
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,072
Any advice?

79
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,108
About?

80
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:09,011
This precinct.
The residents.

81
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,947
Oh. Don't trust 'em.

82
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:14,450
But... that applies everywhere.

83
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:19,488
Not just the places, um,
don't speak the fucking language.

84
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:22,224
Oh, yeah?

85
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:26,095
Well, uh, I'm actually trying
to transfer into this house.

86
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:30,032
Or Rio Píedras, I don't know.
Something with more action.

87
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,102
- Yeah.
- It's slow as hell up in Zone Two.

88
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,071
That's why I volunteered today.

89
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:41,877
- Okay.
- Okay.

90
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,079
So how are we gonna play this?

91
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:45,381
Play what?

92
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:49,385
What if people refuse to leave?

93
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:53,389
Well, then they die
horrible fucking deaths.

94
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:56,992
But this good news is,
is it ain't our fault.

95
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,029
We're not picking anyone up.

96
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:07,102
- Yeah, but, uh, Lt. Cunningham said that we have to...
- Okay, okay, okay.

97
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:11,006
Let's just say that we go out
and we grab a guy, right?

98
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,243
He doesn't wanna leave.
He wants your name,

99
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,179
he wants your badge number
to file a complaint.

100
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:19,348
Yeah, let him.
I'm doing my job.

101
00:12:19,381 --> 00:12:21,183
Oh, like, that matters?

102
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:24,420
You want a transfer
or a promotion,

103
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:28,023
and the bosses, they're gonna
look at your record, right?

104
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:30,259
Oh, see you got a complaint.

105
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,595
Could be bullshit.
Doesn't matter.

106
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,198
You wash your hands at the sink
and you get splash back,

107
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:38,434
it still looks like
you pissed yourself.

108
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:42,204
Okay. So we're doing nothing?

109
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:43,606
That's the idea.

110
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,241
Maybe we'll get
some donuts later.

111
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:55,652
<i>10-52,
Plaza del mercado de Rio Píedras.</i>

112
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:57,086
Don't.

113
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:04,360
Show sector Adam, Boy,
Charlie responding.

114
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:10,065
All right.

115
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:15,571
You insist.

116
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:22,378
All righty then.

117
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,482
What happened?

118
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:36,325
Um, he was trying to clear out
the meat section,

119
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,060
and he got into a fight
with a customer.

120
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:42,030
Mm... clear out
the meat section.

121
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:43,432
What, the entire section?

122
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:46,568
Is there a law against
how much meat I can buy?

123
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:49,606
Sure isn't, but how much meat
were you trying to buy?

124
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,473
Just for the record.

125
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:55,544
- A hundred pounds.
- Oh, wow.

126
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:57,614
- Quite the party.
- Yeah, that's a lot of meat.

127
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:59,114
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

128
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:01,517
Uh, where's the victim?

129
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:09,458
Guy left.
Didn't wanna press charges.

130
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:12,227
All he wanted was to make
hamburgers for his little kid.

131
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:14,530
- Well, that's adorable.
- See, the guy didn't wanna press charges.

132
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,965
Y'all gonna let me go, right?

133
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:21,970
Yeah, well, you tell me what you need
all that meat for, I'll consider it.

134
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,112
Huh...

135
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:34,216
That... is a little suspicious.

136
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,451
Let's go.

137
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:39,622
Let's go.

138
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:41,557
- Y'all arresting me?
- No.

139
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:42,991
We're putting you
on a bus to a shelters.

140
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

141
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,261
- Y'all can't do that.
- No?

142
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:48,598
- I'm pretty sure we can.
- I have to stop past my place.

143
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:51,567
- Yeah?
- Yo, officer, I'm being serious.

144
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:55,304
- This is very important.
- No.

145
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:57,406
Are you just gonna give me
one-word answers?

146
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,241
- Maybe.
- All right. Let's go.

147
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,777
- You know what, fuck you.
- Oh, no.

148
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,044
- Fuck you, too.
- Oh, yeah?

149
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:03,245
- Fuck you.
- You walk...

150
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,148
Whoa!
That escalated quickly.

151
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,185
Yo, officer,
I got some people at my place

152
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,387
- that are refusing to leave.
- Yeah, who?

153
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:14,657
Well, there's this old guy
who never leaves.

154
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:17,125
And a cop.
One of you guys.

155
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,094
How do you know
they don't wanna leave?

156
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,730
Well, the old guy,
he never leaves.

157
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:21,798
And the cop was just bragging

158
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:23,600
about how he wasn't
going nowhere.

159
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,402
Look, I have a pet. That's why
I'm here at the supermarket.

160
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:29,171
- You have a pet?
- Yeah.

161
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:32,241
- What kind of pet?
- A hungry one.

162
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:33,342
Uh-huh. What's its name?

163
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,811
Her name is Janet.

164
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:37,513
Yeah, I don't... I don't like that.

165
00:15:37,546 --> 00:15:40,015
Well, Janet doesn't like cops.
Look, guys...

166
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:46,221
Y'all can arrest me,
do whatever the hell you wanna do.

167
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:49,124
But I need to see her and get
her some water before the storm.

168
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:51,159
Please.

169
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:55,564
You said there's a cop
that won't leave?

170
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:56,799
Yeah.

171
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,737
All right.
Let's go feed your fuckin' cat.

172
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:19,589
That the super?

173
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,523
Yeah.

174
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,359
Yeah, that's him.

175
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:35,137
- What's your name?
- Luillo.

176
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,107
Alright, Louie Joe. This guy says you got
residents that are refusing to evacuate.

177
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:42,845
- That's right.
- He said you got a retired cop and an old guy.

178
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,348
- Old guy in 15E.
- And the cop?

179
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,084
Barrett, 53B.

180
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,486
All right, let's grab Barrett,

181
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,690
and then we'll swing back down
and grab the old guy, okay?

182
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,625
- Okay.
- You gonna let me feed Janet?

183
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:58,293
- What apartment you in?
- Thirty-three-B.

184
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,162
- Is that true?
- Yes.

185
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,632
All right, do it quick.
We'll grab you in five minutes, alright?

186
00:17:02,665 --> 00:17:06,101
Fine. Gracias...

187
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:13,308
Does that say "out of order"?

188
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,178
- What is that?
- <i>Si.</i>

189
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:18,313
- <i>Si.</i>
- <i>Si. Si.</i>

190
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:19,348
Perfect.

191
00:17:23,518 --> 00:17:24,721
Alright.

192
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:26,889
You know,
you should learn some Spanish.

193
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:29,692
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you're in Puerto Rico.

194
00:17:29,726 --> 00:17:33,763
- Yeah.
- That's how we say it. Puerto Rico.

195
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:50,680
Can you get them
to fuck off?

196
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:53,348
We're evacuating the building.

197
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:56,953
We're evacuating the building.

198
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:58,755
Thank God.
I need your help.

199
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:00,555
Look, even the PD's
taking this seriously.

200
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,592
Yeah, current PD's
full of pussies.

201
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,761
Care more about
liability and politics.

202
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:06,361
I'm staying here.
I'm not leaving.

203
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:08,163
I'm not going anywhere.

204
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,769
You gonna take that risk?

205
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:14,971
Well, Hurricane Irene

206
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:17,940
started like this,
came to nothing.

207
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:20,242
She wants to take me
to Centro Medico.

208
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:23,278
That third-rate shithole.
I mean, that's death depot.

209
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,947
We used to take OD cases there.

210
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:26,949
I don't recall seeing
any of them ever again.

211
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:32,588
Well, unfortunately, sir,
it's either that or the evac bus.

212
00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:36,391
Excuse me, senorita.

213
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:37,426
You all right there?

214
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:39,494
You worked in Rio Píedras?

215
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:41,931
Yeah, I used to run that house.

216
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:44,199
Do I know you?

217
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,869
I know you.

218
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:49,005
'Cause I just put in
a transfer there.

219
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,441
Is that right?
Where do I know you from?

220
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:53,576
I know you.

221
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:03,552
- I know you from someplace.
- Uh... from this evac.

222
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:06,354
- Sir, can we get your stuff?
- Yeah, let's get going.

223
00:19:06,388 --> 00:19:07,990
You're Cardillo.

224
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,625
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, Cardillo.

225
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:11,761
You had that thing
about a year ago, right?

226
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:15,330
Yeah?
How'd it go down?

227
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:21,671
It got me down here.
Don't worry about it.

228
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:23,706
I'm not worried about it..

229
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:28,477
They catch the guy
that made the call?

230
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:33,315
Eventually, yeah.

231
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:34,684
Yeah?
Did you beat his ass?

232
00:19:34,717 --> 00:19:36,518
- Dad...
- Did I what?

233
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:37,653
Did you beat his ass?

234
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:38,821
Hey, back in my day

235
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:40,890
we had this moron called
Willie Bosket.

236
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:43,993
He used to call the stationhouse
to report a rape or a robbery.

237
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:47,830
We'd all rush down there, the guy'd be
on the roof with a BB gun, sniping us.

238
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:50,398
About the third around we caught
him and broke a few fingers.

239
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:53,535
- Nice, Dad. That's real nice.
- Hey, it stopped him. Okay?

240
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:56,806
- Yep.
- Hey, the other cop, the partner.

241
00:19:57,707 --> 00:19:59,508
That was your girl, right?

242
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:10,552
Troy, honey, uh, I think
I like my odds better here.

243
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,089
I'm a stubborn asshole,
she takes after me.

244
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:14,791
I'm standing right here,
you know what I mean?

245
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:16,959
Hey, what do you think
I got fuckin' Alzheimer's...?

246
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:20,395
It's a Category 5 fuckin' hurricane goin'
on outside, and you forgot about that.

247
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:22,098
You think it's a five already?

248
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:25,333
Hey, lay it out for me.
How did it go down?

249
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,669
Tell me.

250
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:30,039
Alright, I'm gonna go
grab the other old guy.

251
00:20:30,072 --> 00:20:32,074
- Sir, I highly advise...
- Other old guy?

252
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:34,442
- ...that you go with your daughter.
- Yes, thank you.

253
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:35,812
Or in this case,
your guardian.

254
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:37,013
- Oh, a fuckin' comedian, yeah.

255
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:38,881
And it's only out
of respect for the badge

256
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:41,951
that you're not on a 51-50 hold,
face down on the ground,

257
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:43,586
- hog-tied and fuckin' cuffed...
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

258
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,387
What, you gonna shoot me, too?

259
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,823
Okay, you hear me,
you crazy old fuck?!

260
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:50,358
- Shut the fuck up!
- You cop-killing cocksucker!

261
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:51,794
- Hey!
- Where you goin?

262
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:52,995
- Where you goin'?
- You stay!

263
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:54,396
Yeah, and don't go
with that guy.

264
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:55,731
Not without a
bulletproof vest.

265
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:57,767
Honestly, you are
so fuckin' stubborn.

266
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,839
This guy's your fuckin' partner?

267
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:04,073
Yep.

268
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,375
You're a very brave girl.

269
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,645
Hey, hey! What are you...

270
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,148
What are you doing?
You're just gonna leave?

271
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:14,549
Your dad doesn't
wanna leave, ma'am.

272
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:16,384
I can't force him.

273
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:18,386
Isn't that what
you're here for?

274
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:20,690
What do you want me to do?

275
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:22,058
Do you want me
to carry him down?

276
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:24,026
Hey, you know what,
I don't care what you do.

277
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,128
He needs his dialysis machine,

278
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:29,632
but once the storm knocks
the power out in this building,

279
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:30,565
nothing's going to work.

280
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,902
No machine is gonna work.

281
00:21:32,935 --> 00:21:35,004
I have a bed for him
reserved at the hospital,

282
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:37,640
but if we don't get there soon,
we lose it.

283
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:42,044
You really a doctor?

284
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:47,617
No, I just like wearing
pajamas all day.

285
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,019
Look, all I'm asking you to do,
is to go back in there with me,

286
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:52,822
and help me get him the fuck out
of this building.

287
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:56,025
Well, Officer Pena's
with him, okay.

288
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,928
She'll take him down.

289
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:02,598
He doesn't exactly respond
to female authority.

290
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:10,773
Alright.

291
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:12,574
You know this old guy, right?

292
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:18,214
Yeah, I've seen him around.

293
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:21,549
Do me a favor,
and help me with him.

294
00:22:21,584 --> 00:22:23,152
And once we get him out
we'll come back up,

295
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:25,154
and we'll grab your father.
Okay?

296
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,927
Alright. Come on.

297
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:38,533
Around the corner to the left.

298
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:40,136
Down there.

299
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:42,004
Straight ahead.

300
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:49,544
This guy always have
this much security?

301
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,513
Not that I recall.
Sir?

302
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:53,082
Hello, sir, it's Troy Barrett.

303
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:54,750
You know my father, Ray.

304
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:57,687
Hello, sir.

305
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:02,524
What can I help you with?

306
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:03,960
You need to come with us, sir.

307
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:05,728
No, I cannot leave.

308
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,663
You're gonna be
flooded out here if you stay,

309
00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:10,498
you're on the first floor.
It's too dangerous.

310
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:13,970
Has your father left?

311
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:16,072
We're gonna evacuate him
right after you.

312
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:17,773
Cardillo to Pena.

313
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:19,675
The sooner you come with me...
We're gonna get him,

314
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:20,876
we're gonna get everyone
safe out of the building.

315
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,812
Pena, are you there?

316
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:33,089
Cardillo, you copy?

317
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:35,257
Crickets, huh?

318
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,160
All your comms
are down in this shit.

319
00:23:38,194 --> 00:23:42,932
Hey, listen, sweetheart.
You don't need to babysit me, okay.

320
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,208
So you ran Rio Píedras, huh?

321
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:54,777
Yeah, you're not leaving.
Okay.

322
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,612
Okay, you don't take a hint,
do ya?

323
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:59,015
I'll be clearer. You can go now.
Thank you. It's...

324
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:01,117
- So...
- I'm good, thank you.

325
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,887
I'm trying to transfer into that
house, but it's being held up.

326
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,092
So... you think
you can put in... a word for me?

327
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,935
Pena, do you copy?

328
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,104
I know it feels safer
to stay here,

329
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:23,806
but we gotta
get to higher ground.

330
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,207
You cannot park there!

331
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:27,910
I'm safer here, I'm safer here.
I'm not leaving.

332
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:30,112
I cannot leave my home.

333
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:35,217
Hey! Hey!
You can park back there.

334
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:38,954
Keep it moving!

335
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,290
Get out!

336
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:43,859
You cannot park there!

337
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,295
I'll take care of this.

338
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:54,603
What is it with the stubborn
bastards in this building?

339
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:56,939
- You have to come with us.
- I'm sorry, I'm not going.

340
00:24:56,972 --> 00:24:58,674
Officer!

341
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,943
- Hold on just a second. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

342
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:04,180
- So you can go.
- No, this is an evacuation.

343
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:07,049
Please, just go.

344
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,918
They are closing the roads.

345
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:12,288
Please, keep going.
Come on, man.

346
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:16,826
Take it easy. Take it easy...

347
00:25:29,772 --> 00:25:31,941
Let's go! Let's go!
We gotta go now!

348
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:33,275
- You alright?
- Why?

349
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:35,244
We've gotta go right now.
Come on! Come on!

350
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:37,947
Right now!

351
00:25:40,382 --> 00:25:41,884
Okay. Come here.

352
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,719
Come on! Quick, quick!

353
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:46,288
Ernesto...

354
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:57,233
It's a fucking cop!

355
00:25:59,468 --> 00:26:01,237
No, no, no. Don't shoot.

356
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,972
You might hit the old man.

357
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:07,176
Migs, you need to
catch up with them.

358
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:08,377
Top floor.

359
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,315
- Who the hell were those guys?
- I have no idea.

360
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:14,817
We have to
get back to my dad.

361
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,218
No, it's too far.
We won't make it.

362
00:26:16,252 --> 00:26:17,386
They'll see us.

363
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:19,121
Well, then where are we going?

364
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:20,189
Up.

365
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,958
Come... Come on. Come on.

366
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:28,898
What are we gonna do
about the fucking cop?

367
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:31,133
Don't get excited.
They're trapped.

368
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,035
Those stairs only lead up

369
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:35,137
and the only exit
is on this floor.

370
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:37,973
Dillon, start your way on top
and work your way down.

371
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,976
Pride, Ernesto,
you two guard the front door.

372
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,046
Nobody gets in.
Nobody gets out.

373
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,314
Okay? Go.

374
00:26:56,192 --> 00:26:57,826
Let's go.

375
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:02,865
Janet! I'm sorry, baby.
I'm coming.

376
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:04,733
I got caught up
in the supermarket.

377
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:08,504
Alright. Here we go.

378
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:11,273
I know, I know, I know, I know.

379
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:14,977
Open the door, right now!

380
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:17,146
Open the door.

381
00:27:18,113 --> 00:27:19,815
I'll meet you downstairs.

382
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,151
Open the door, Griffin.

383
00:27:23,085 --> 00:27:24,887
Griffin, open the door!

384
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,255
You gotta let us in, right now.

385
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,756
Fuck that!

386
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,459
How I know you're not
setting me up?

387
00:27:33,295 --> 00:27:34,763
Back, back, back...

388
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:36,232
Griffin,
you think this is a trap?

389
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:37,933
I let you go earlier.

390
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:40,803
Listen, I've got Troy and your
downstairs neighbor here.

391
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:44,173
You don't understand right now. We are gonna
get our motherfuckin' heads blown off!

392
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,979
Open the door.

393
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:51,380
Shit.

394
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,151
We on the same side?

395
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:58,020
Hey, do me a favor, alright?

396
00:27:58,053 --> 00:27:59,255
Put your ear to the door.

397
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:01,123
I'm gonna tell you something.

398
00:28:01,156 --> 00:28:03,425
- Put your ear to the door!
- My ear's to the goddamn door!

399
00:28:04,293 --> 00:28:05,394
Okay.

400
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:09,198
Open the fucking door!

401
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:19,408
Central, 10-13.

402
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:22,344
Shots fired.
Okay...

403
00:28:22,378 --> 00:28:23,946
Who's killing who?

404
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:25,414
- Just quiet down. Be quiet.
- No you quiet down!

405
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:26,815
You in my house.

406
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:28,050
Shots fired at...
What's the address here?

407
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,152
- Six... sixty-five...
- Six-five-eight.

408
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:31,220
Six-five-eight...

409
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,326
Fuck! Land line.
I need a land line.

410
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,495
- Do you have a land line?
- Sorry, man, I didn't get the fuckin' bundle.

411
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:41,363
- Who the fuck's got a land line, man?
- Oh, fuck.

412
00:28:41,397 --> 00:28:43,365
You know, you guys
bust into my place

413
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,968
without any consideration.
I don't give a fuck who shot who.

414
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:48,003
Super Louie Joe...

415
00:28:48,037 --> 00:28:50,072
Well, he's super fucking dead,
okay!

416
00:28:54,343 --> 00:28:56,278
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!

417
00:28:58,314 --> 00:29:00,617
Give me that bowl of food!

418
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,352
- What?
- Give me that bowl of food!

419
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:05,220
- What food?
- Give me the bowl of food!

420
00:29:05,254 --> 00:29:07,523
- What?
- Give me that bowl of food!

421
00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:14,196
Help!

422
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:21,203
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- What?

423
00:29:21,236 --> 00:29:22,271
Don't shoot.

424
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,606
Don't shoot?

425
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,008
Just bring me that bowl of food.

426
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:29,278
- What?
- Bring me the bowl of food!

427
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,947
It's right behind you.
Bring me the bowl of food.

428
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,017
Okay...

429
00:29:42,124 --> 00:29:43,425
Oh, my God.

430
00:29:47,262 --> 00:29:48,964
What the fuck?

431
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:52,968
Stop, stop...

432
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:56,505
- What?
- Take off your uniform.

433
00:29:56,538 --> 00:29:58,340
Take off my fucking uniform?

434
00:29:58,374 --> 00:30:01,477
Yeah. She hates cops.
I trained her.

435
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,445
If you don't want her
to bite your fuckin' ass

436
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,147
take your uniform off.

437
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:20,162
Okay.
Tell me your story.

438
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:21,463
What do you mean?
What kind of story?

439
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:23,132
A Disney story.
What do you think?

440
00:30:23,165 --> 00:30:25,635
I want your story.
Like your best collar.

441
00:30:25,668 --> 00:30:28,904
If you want a rec,
you gotta gimme something to work with.

442
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:35,544
There was a warrant out on a murder
suspect about five months back.

443
00:30:35,578 --> 00:30:39,415
I'm on patrol driving by the
Burger King off Avenida Ashford.

444
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:42,451
And see a guy
in the parking lot.

445
00:30:42,484 --> 00:30:45,988
Six-two, 160, long hair.

446
00:30:46,021 --> 00:30:47,456
We park and approach.

447
00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:51,126
But as I'm getting closer,
I realize it's not the guy.

448
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:02,304
Slow. Nothing too quick.

449
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:04,607
Oh, my God.

450
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:07,242
Alright,
now you gonna grab my hand.

451
00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:08,343
Alright.

452
00:31:08,377 --> 00:31:09,646
And when I say,

453
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,079
pull me out as fast as you can.

454
00:31:11,113 --> 00:31:12,347
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

455
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:14,751
- Alright.
- Okay, here we go. Okay.

456
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:16,084
Go!

457
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:17,687
Close the door!

458
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,721
Close the door!
Close the door!

459
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:23,992
What the fuck is that?!

460
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:26,395
Oh, shit.

461
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,698
I lost them.

462
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:30,633
You lost them?

463
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,568
They gotta be somewhere
around in the building.

464
00:31:32,602 --> 00:31:35,204
- There's no other way out.
- No. Shut the fuck up.

465
00:31:35,237 --> 00:31:36,572
Alright? No excuses!

466
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:42,311
Okay? Go find them.
Now, go!

467
00:31:58,828 --> 00:32:01,396
And that's your fucking pet?

468
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:05,167
Fucking got a killing machine
for a fucking service animal.

469
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,703
Okay, we got a problem.

470
00:32:06,736 --> 00:32:09,137
What kinda
bedside manner talk is this?

471
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:11,139
"We got a problem."
You don't wanna ease me in?

472
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:13,041
Uh.. could really use a saw.

473
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,279
Yeah, this would be a great
point for an amputate.

474
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:18,815
No, you're not
cutting my leg off!

475
00:32:18,848 --> 00:32:20,750
We didn't have time
to ease you in.

476
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:22,217
What do you need?

477
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:24,386
Uh, a splint
to secure the femur.

478
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,757
Anti-septic, penicillin,
gauze, stitches.

479
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,760
I know a doctor.

480
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:33,228
Congratulations.

481
00:32:33,262 --> 00:32:35,464
He's here in the building.

482
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:38,200
- Dr. Berman.
- Yeah, what apartment? Where?

483
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:41,403
It's uh... 63B.

484
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:43,205
Shit...

485
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:46,408
Alright, I'll go get that stuff.

486
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:48,343
- Well, I'll come with you.
- No, no, you gotta stay here with him...

487
00:32:48,377 --> 00:32:50,279
No, I'll come with you.
The sooner we take care of this,

488
00:32:50,312 --> 00:32:52,247
the sooner I can
get back to my father.

489
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:53,850
Alright.

490
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:55,618
Hey, come over here.
Come here.

491
00:32:55,652 --> 00:32:57,252
Come, I need your help.

492
00:32:57,286 --> 00:32:58,755
I need you to take
both your hands

493
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:01,323
and apply pressure
to this wound, okay. Hard.

494
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:05,527
Talk to him, keep him awake.
It's just as important

495
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:07,262
as applying pressure
to the wound. You got it?

496
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:09,231
Okay.

497
00:33:09,264 --> 00:33:10,867
- Griffin...
- Hm?

498
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,235
There any back stairs?
Alternate routes up?

499
00:33:13,268 --> 00:33:15,605
There's only one set of stairs.

500
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:17,306
And the elevator,
but the elevator's out.

501
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:18,708
Yeah, of course it is.

502
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:20,442
But there's another way.

503
00:33:21,343 --> 00:33:22,779
Scaffolding.

504
00:33:26,716 --> 00:33:28,317
Scaffolding.

505
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:36,291
So... Oh, yeah... the guy
we're looking for has tats

506
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:37,459
and this guy's clean.

507
00:33:37,492 --> 00:33:41,698
But something was off.
He looks nervous.

508
00:33:42,531 --> 00:33:44,767
My radar starts going off

509
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:46,368
and that's when I see it.

510
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:48,638
What?

511
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:52,341
A giant bulge
sticking out of his...

512
00:33:52,374 --> 00:33:55,444
- you know...
- What, his crotch? What?

513
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:59,348
No, his ass.

514
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:01,249
I see the top
of a plastic baggie

515
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:03,185
sticking out the top
of his pants.

516
00:34:03,218 --> 00:34:05,354
I ask him what it is,
he goes nuts.

517
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:08,223
We cuff him, took him back
to the stationhouse,

518
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,458
and when we strip search him

519
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:13,830
we find 93 baggies
of crack cocaine.

520
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:17,834
Biggest narcotics collar
that month.

521
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,202
- Biggest.
- Wow.

522
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:23,606
So what you're telling me is you
stumble onto a narcotics collar,

523
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:28,645
oh, because some moron had a family-sized
baggie sticking out of his ass?

524
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:30,345
That's your best collar?

525
00:34:31,513 --> 00:34:33,850
You didn't even have
probable cause.

526
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:41,858
- Never mind.
- No, you know, I'm just saying.

527
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:43,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They should be done by now.

528
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:45,494
I'm...
I'm gonna go check on them.

529
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:47,496
- Yeah...
- Yeah, you can do...

530
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:49,766
You can do, you know, whatever.

531
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:52,869
I'm such an asshole.

532
00:34:55,004 --> 00:34:57,372
- You got it?
- Yeah.

533
00:35:08,718 --> 00:35:11,788
So, two flights up
and three units over.

534
00:35:11,821 --> 00:35:13,221
Yeah.
Are you a good shot?

535
00:35:14,924 --> 00:35:16,324
Yeah, why?

536
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:17,794
Do me a favor.

537
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:19,862
If I fall, shoot me.

538
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:23,465
I don't wanna wait four-and-a-half
hours to die of a brain hemorrhage.

539
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:24,734
Yeah, what if I fall?

540
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:27,770
You're a hard-headed.
You'll survive.

541
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,945
- Ready?
- Blow it.

542
00:36:02,905 --> 00:36:04,372
Watch it, sweetheart.

543
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:06,943
Take your hand
off your gun, slowly.

544
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:09,244
Hands in the air.

545
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:12,815
Where are they?

546
00:36:14,584 --> 00:36:15,885
Where are who?

547
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:17,620
Your partner and the old man.

548
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:23,391
Follow me.

549
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:25,661
- I'll show you.
- Go.

550
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,032
Better not be fucking with me.

551
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:33,803
Come on.

552
00:36:37,472 --> 00:36:39,942
Hey! You mind pointing
that gun somewhere else?

553
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,376
Hey, shut the fuck up.

554
00:36:42,812 --> 00:36:43,980
Is this it?

555
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:46,649
This is it.

556
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:49,685
You go first.

557
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,453
If this is a fucking ambush,

558
00:36:51,486 --> 00:36:53,421
I swear to God,
I will fucking kill you.

559
00:36:53,455 --> 00:36:55,490
Hey, asshole!

560
00:37:00,395 --> 00:37:03,599
Oh, yeah. Come on, now,
help me drag him inside.

561
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:06,068
He's a heavy motherfucker.

562
00:37:06,102 --> 00:37:08,503
Yeah, come on.
Come on, buddy.

563
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:15,510
Boss!

564
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:35,430
Get down there.
I'll go check on Chaz, bro.

565
00:37:41,871 --> 00:37:45,975
Don't worry.
She won't break through.

566
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:51,914
What's your name?

567
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,018
Paul.

568
00:37:56,786 --> 00:37:57,920
Paul...

569
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:01,591
What's the accent?

570
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,026
German?

571
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,696
- German, yes.
- Mm-hm.

572
00:38:07,562 --> 00:38:09,665
I'm Jason.

573
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:11,133
I'd offer to shake your hand,

574
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:13,435
but I really need you
to keep pushing down.

575
00:38:13,468 --> 00:38:15,671
Of course.

576
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:01,083
Give me the gun.

577
00:39:30,813 --> 00:39:32,048
Oh, shit.

578
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:40,256
Hey, it'll be okay.

579
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:42,224
Yeah...

580
00:39:46,062 --> 00:39:48,097
They're on the fourth floor,
heading up.

581
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,599
- Where's Ernesto?
- He's dead.

582
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:52,969
Bigger splits
for the rest of us.

583
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:01,711
Ah...
You recognize the name?

584
00:40:01,744 --> 00:40:04,013
Alexander Dillon.
No.

585
00:40:04,046 --> 00:40:05,547
No, should I?

586
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:07,650
You want to work the good cases,

587
00:40:07,683 --> 00:40:09,218
you gotta know the players.

588
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:12,688
- Who is he?
- He's part of a crew.

589
00:40:12,722 --> 00:40:16,025
He does high end heist jobs:
jewelry, museums, armored trucks.

590
00:40:18,094 --> 00:40:20,896
The shot caller's
a real psycho piece of shit.

591
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,065
Calls himself John the Baptist.

592
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,634
I got a buddy downtown,
a lieutenant I trained,

593
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:27,603
he works the major
crime zone three.

594
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:32,274
He's been chasing these clowns for a...
for a month.

595
00:40:32,308 --> 00:40:34,210
You okay?
Are you alright?

596
00:40:34,243 --> 00:40:36,278
Yeah. Hey...
Can you do me a favor?

597
00:40:36,312 --> 00:40:38,214
Get my pills.

598
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:40,649
Oxy, oxy...
whatever the fuck you call it.

599
00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:42,651
I can't pronounce it.
Uh, not that room.

600
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:45,021
The next door down.
That's my wife's art studio.

601
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:46,789
The next door down
is the bathroom.

602
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:51,861
So did you read the paper?

603
00:40:51,894 --> 00:40:54,330
Today? No. No, why?

604
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:58,034
So this crew targets
this blue-haired old bag.

605
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:00,636
But the bop the old girl before
they could finish the job,

606
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:02,004
the greedy fuckers.

607
00:41:02,038 --> 00:41:03,139
That was this guy Dillon?

608
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:05,107
It's empty, by the way.

609
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:07,610
Ah, yeah, thanks.
This guy? Yeah.

610
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:09,178
My buddy thinks
he's one of them, yeah.

611
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:12,181
I haven't worn this in 15 years.

612
00:41:12,214 --> 00:41:14,116
What if it still fits?

613
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,052
What... what do you think
these guys want?

614
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:17,286
Yeah...

615
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:20,756
I might have a pretty good idea.

616
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,326
But if you're trying to make
an impression, now's the time.

617
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,361
Let's go.

618
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:33,035
- What apartment is this?
- 44B.

619
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:35,104
All right... up and two over.

620
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,977
She's this woman,
came into the hospital bunch of times.

621
00:41:42,011 --> 00:41:44,914
Claimed cops used to hold her down
and inject rat blood in her eyes.

622
00:41:44,947 --> 00:41:47,750
What? Roberta Gradischer?

623
00:41:47,783 --> 00:41:50,119
- You know her?
- Oh, yeah.

624
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:52,354
Wait a second.

625
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,591
It was you.

626
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:58,928
Right? It was you.
That's what my father

627
00:41:58,961 --> 00:42:00,663
was referring to downstairs.

628
00:42:00,696 --> 00:42:02,998
Uh.. partially, yeah.

629
00:42:03,032 --> 00:42:06,335
Oh, my God.
She used to say it was two cops.

630
00:42:06,368 --> 00:42:08,370
- Smith...
- No, Smythe.

631
00:42:08,404 --> 00:42:11,273
Smith and Smythe. Exactly.

632
00:42:11,307 --> 00:42:12,875
Did you treat her?

633
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,411
After four times, I had to
give her an eye dropper.

634
00:42:15,444 --> 00:42:17,279
Told her there was
holy water in it.

635
00:42:17,313 --> 00:42:20,883
That's funny. She actually
brought that down to the lab.

636
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:23,786
She wanted us
to test it for rat poison.

637
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:27,656
See? She didn't trust me either.

638
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,959
She wanted me
to file a police report.

639
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:31,794
On me?

640
00:42:31,827 --> 00:42:35,064
Wait... let me see that.

641
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:36,799
- Come here.
- Oh, it's not... It's not.

642
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:38,033
- Come here.
- Oh, it's fine.

643
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:39,401
Come here.

644
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:44,673
- It's a surface wound...
- Yeah, it's fine.

645
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:48,244
No, it was a police report...
It was for the commissioner.

646
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:50,212
Yeah, she, uh...

647
00:42:50,246 --> 00:42:55,117
She thought that the police
commissioner was stealing her coupons.

648
00:42:55,151 --> 00:42:57,052
No... shit.

649
00:42:57,086 --> 00:42:59,655
She's fuckin' nuts.

650
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:26,749
You mind if I ask you something?

651
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:30,819
I mind if you ask permission.
You wanna ask something, just ask.

652
00:43:30,853 --> 00:43:33,756
What the hell did you stay for?

653
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:35,457
I mean, you had to know
the storm was gonna be bad.

654
00:43:35,491 --> 00:43:37,259
Right?

655
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:42,865
Do you know what
a fecal transplant is?

656
00:43:42,898 --> 00:43:45,034
- A what?
- A fecal transplant.

657
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:46,802
It's exactly
what it sounds like.

658
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:50,306
Doctor takes someone else's
shit, puts it in your body.

659
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:51,907
- What the hell for?
- Yeah, right.

660
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:53,175
It's good for colitis,
or something.

661
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:54,510
Troy wants me to do that.

662
00:43:54,543 --> 00:43:56,312
I also got
some other bullshit going on.

663
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:58,781
Kidneys, lungs...
They're fucked.

664
00:43:58,814 --> 00:44:01,083
It's gonna kill me, eventually.
I'm on a million pills.

665
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:02,818
She takes me to the hospital,
it's over,

666
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:04,153
and I'm not going out that way.

667
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:07,256
Jackpot!

668
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,129
So you are or aren't
full of shit?

669
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:17,800
Shut the fuck up.

670
00:44:20,803 --> 00:44:22,938
I ran out of my prescription.

671
00:44:22,972 --> 00:44:26,842
- What's that?
- Oxy-moron. It's good for the pain.

672
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,011
- Want one?
- I'm good.

673
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:30,246
Okay.

674
00:44:41,323 --> 00:44:43,359
Now I'm ready.
Let's go, smartass.

675
00:44:43,392 --> 00:44:44,393
Okay.

676
00:44:46,428 --> 00:44:48,998
- Wait, wait, wait...
- What?

677
00:44:49,031 --> 00:44:51,967
- Where we going?
- Oh... apartment 44A.

678
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:54,403
Ex-DEA agent lives there.
He's armed to the teeth.

679
00:44:54,436 --> 00:44:56,205
He's like a survivalist.

680
00:44:56,238 --> 00:44:58,240
If we're gonna stand
any kinda chance at all,

681
00:44:58,274 --> 00:45:00,075
we need all the firepower
we can get.

682
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:01,410
Remember, shoot to kill, kid.

683
00:45:01,443 --> 00:45:04,046
I got your back.
You got mine, alright?

684
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,381
Here we go.

685
00:45:19,395 --> 00:45:21,864
Get the fuck in.

686
00:45:35,411 --> 00:45:36,812
Fuck.

687
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,319
Drop it.

688
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,623
Drop it.

689
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:48,090
Drop it.

690
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:50,926
Slowly.

691
00:45:52,561 --> 00:45:53,929
Now toss it.

692
00:45:55,665 --> 00:45:57,900
Come on.

693
00:45:57,933 --> 00:46:00,035
Don't you move
or I'll blow your head off.

694
00:46:00,603 --> 00:46:02,204
Where's the old man?

695
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:05,541
He's up my ass,
you wanna tickle his feet?

696
00:47:40,102 --> 00:47:41,336
Come on.

697
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,439
Can't get a shot.

698
00:48:36,325 --> 00:48:38,994
Wow! Oh, good. Come on.

699
00:48:41,196 --> 00:48:43,766
- You shot me!
- Come on!

700
00:48:45,768 --> 00:48:47,770
Come on!

701
00:48:47,804 --> 00:48:50,707
I couldn't help it.
You were in the way.

702
00:48:56,545 --> 00:48:58,413
Where the hell did they go?
Did you see?

703
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:00,516
You're kidding me.
I couldn't see anything.

704
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:02,551
You're supposed to be
my eyes, kid.

705
00:49:02,585 --> 00:49:04,186
Okay, watch out.

706
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:06,288
Hey, hey! Don't.
I got a key.

707
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:07,624
Are you fucking kidding me?

708
00:49:07,657 --> 00:49:10,727
This guy's a friendly.
I think it's this one.

709
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,327
Yeah, there you go.

710
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:17,232
Everything I told you, right?
Huh?

711
00:49:17,266 --> 00:49:19,736
One-stop shopping,
ladies and gentlemen.

712
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:20,770
Holy shit.

713
00:49:20,803 --> 00:49:22,538
Choose your weapon.

714
00:49:22,571 --> 00:49:24,239
Take your pick.

715
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:52,769
You a Nazi?

716
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:01,744
You don't like people like me.

717
00:50:06,248 --> 00:50:07,784
Oh, no, I...

718
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:13,221
I don't...
feel that way anymore.

719
00:50:13,255 --> 00:50:16,291
I didn't think
there was no Nazis left.

720
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,162
I guess there gotta be some.

721
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:24,601
But they must be old as shit like your ass.

722
00:50:42,819 --> 00:50:44,419
Can you hold this?

723
00:50:48,256 --> 00:50:50,359
Bullet passed
straight to the calf.

724
00:50:50,392 --> 00:50:53,763
Tibia, fibula clear.

725
00:50:53,796 --> 00:50:57,767
Lucky me, huh?

726
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,671
No... I'm a good shot.

727
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:08,210
Yeah...

728
00:51:10,512 --> 00:51:14,216
Yeah, one Thanksgiving,
my dad...

729
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:19,889
he went out and bought
a bunch of frozen turkeys.

730
00:51:20,723 --> 00:51:23,525
Not for eating them.

731
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:26,663
But he brought them home to just
shoot the fuck out of them all.

732
00:51:26,696 --> 00:51:28,865
Just filled those birds
up with lead.

733
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:30,933
Just...

734
00:51:31,868 --> 00:51:34,671
Target practice.

735
00:51:37,506 --> 00:51:39,676
And I was really excited,
'cause...

736
00:51:40,743 --> 00:51:42,845
I always wanted to be a doctor.

737
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,616
And I loved it 'cause...

738
00:51:46,649 --> 00:51:49,551
I got to pick all the bullets
out of the birds and...

739
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:52,622
stitch up all the holes.

740
00:51:52,655 --> 00:51:54,356
Wow.

741
00:51:56,558 --> 00:51:59,929
So what were you and my dad
really talking about downstairs?

742
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:07,637
Well...

743
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:19,514
I used to be on the detective
squad out in New York.

744
00:52:20,315 --> 00:52:22,018
Real busy.

745
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:25,487
Never a down moment.
I loved it.

746
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:30,993
And, uh, I hear a call
for a gun run one night.

747
00:52:31,027 --> 00:52:36,498
And, uh, I'm close,
like four blocks away.

748
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,603
<i>I don't even hesitate.
Take it.</i>

749
00:52:40,636 --> 00:52:42,270
<i>But I'm with Jasmine.</i>

750
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:45,440
Uh, she's my, um...

751
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,344
I get it.

752
00:52:55,885 --> 00:52:57,954
That's actually
just down the way from here.

753
00:52:57,987 --> 00:52:59,956
Come on, baby, please...

754
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:02,759
<i>She asked me</i>
<i>not to take the call.</i>

755
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,462
<i>Jasmine was a cop, too,</i>

756
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,802
But I told her, you know,
stay in the car at home.

757
00:53:13,636 --> 00:53:15,705
<i>And to call for backup.</i>

758
00:53:15,738 --> 00:53:17,774
I'll take care of it.

759
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:24,013
So I go in there.

760
00:53:25,748 --> 00:53:27,415
<i>I see a barrel.</i>

761
00:53:30,452 --> 00:53:32,855
I amped up,
I squeeze the trigger...

762
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:39,629
<i>And I'm just...</i>

763
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,433
Jasmine.

764
00:53:49,906 --> 00:53:51,874
Where was the guy with the gun?

765
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,443
There was no gun.

766
00:53:55,477 --> 00:53:56,879
Hey!

767
00:53:56,913 --> 00:53:58,681
- You call this in?
- Yeah.

768
00:53:58,714 --> 00:54:00,415
You have any weapons?
I'm gonna search...

769
00:54:00,448 --> 00:54:03,418
<i>This asshole just
called in a fake gun run</i>

770
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:08,024
'cause he figured that we were taking too
long to respond to his noise complaint.

771
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:13,763
That's not on you,
you know that.

772
00:54:15,564 --> 00:54:16,933
I know.

773
00:54:18,134 --> 00:54:21,336
But it happened to me,
you know.

774
00:54:26,408 --> 00:54:28,510
I put her in that position.

775
00:54:33,683 --> 00:54:36,586
I always said I'd never
hook up with a cop.

776
00:54:38,588 --> 00:54:40,957
What, why?
Because of your father?

777
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:43,726
Yeah, I'm not really that
into kissing my dad, you know.

778
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:46,629
Well, daddy issues, huh?

779
00:54:55,204 --> 00:54:57,372
He always wanted a boy.

780
00:55:04,914 --> 00:55:06,414
Troy.

781
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:10,853
You really believe that?

782
00:55:14,489 --> 00:55:15,791
You met him.

783
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:19,561
I did. Yeah.

784
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:22,064
He's a fucking asshole, but...

785
00:55:22,098 --> 00:55:25,467
I also met you...

786
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,904
and I'm pretty sure
he doesn't think that.

787
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:43,119
Well done.

788
00:55:45,755 --> 00:55:48,991
We'll have you back like
you've never been shot before.

789
00:55:49,025 --> 00:55:51,794
God, you got the touch, Doc.

790
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,497
Alright.

791
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:58,768
- You're good.
- Thank you.

792
00:56:06,842 --> 00:56:09,812
When we, uh, get out of here...

793
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:11,180
do you, um...

794
00:56:12,547 --> 00:56:15,117
be open to...

795
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:18,220
you know, helping me
take these stitches out.

796
00:56:18,254 --> 00:56:19,956
I'm gonna need 'em out for sure.

797
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:22,825
No, no, I'm... I'm serious.
Like, uh...

798
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:26,095
I'm... I'm very particular
when it comes to making sure

799
00:56:26,128 --> 00:56:27,897
I get my stitches out
and all that.

800
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:31,167
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, needles and such.

801
00:56:32,969 --> 00:56:35,071
Well, I am particularly
good at that.

802
00:56:35,871 --> 00:56:37,505
I appreciate that.

803
00:56:38,808 --> 00:56:40,176
Anytime.

804
00:56:55,324 --> 00:56:57,827
Boss, you gotta see this.

805
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:06,534
Ah, that looks nice.

806
00:57:06,568 --> 00:57:08,304
Nice Uzi, that's a good one.

807
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:11,539
Have one of these.
This could be handy.

808
00:57:11,573 --> 00:57:13,109
I like this little baby, here.

809
00:57:13,142 --> 00:57:15,111
Don't you want an M4,
maybe a shotgun?

810
00:57:15,144 --> 00:57:16,746
Don't fucking move!

811
00:57:16,779 --> 00:57:18,714
Whoa, okay.

812
00:57:21,684 --> 00:57:23,786
So this is the spot?

813
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:25,821
Why, you asking us
or telling us?

814
00:57:25,855 --> 00:57:27,690
I'm asking, fuck-face.

815
00:57:27,723 --> 00:57:29,925
I'm just trying
to clarify is all.

816
00:57:29,959 --> 00:57:31,227
Yes...

817
00:57:33,596 --> 00:57:34,964
This is the spot.

818
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:39,201
Put your weapons on the floor.

819
00:57:39,235 --> 00:57:41,170
All right, nice and slow now.

820
00:57:41,203 --> 00:57:43,072
Make the man happy, sweetheart.

821
00:57:43,906 --> 00:57:44,940
Arms... arms up.

822
00:57:44,974 --> 00:57:47,043
Weapons on the floor, that's it.

823
00:57:47,076 --> 00:57:48,644
Nice and calm now.

824
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:55,117
Okay.

825
00:57:57,953 --> 00:57:59,255
Okay?

826
00:58:36,425 --> 00:58:41,063
Ah, fuck. Fuck!

827
00:58:46,969 --> 00:58:48,003
- Hey.
- Hey!

828
00:58:48,037 --> 00:58:49,638
Nice fucking work, kid.

829
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:51,974
I think I got a spare hole here.

830
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:55,211
Yeah, fuck.

831
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:56,779
They opened me apart.

832
00:58:56,812 --> 00:58:58,848
Yeah, help me up.
You lie down you die.

833
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:01,283
Help me up.

834
00:59:01,317 --> 00:59:04,153
Okay. Okay.

835
00:59:04,186 --> 00:59:06,055
It's empty!
It's fucking empty!

836
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,757
I know it's fucking empty!
Shut the fuck up!

837
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:10,860
Okay. The old man
knows where the art is.

838
00:59:10,893 --> 00:59:12,094
We find the old man,
we find the art.

839
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:13,829
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

840
00:59:16,432 --> 00:59:20,102
You trained Janet
to attack the police?

841
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:23,372
Yeah.

842
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,242
Why?

843
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:31,013
I was walking home from work...

844
00:59:33,749 --> 00:59:35,784
and two cops, they stop me.

845
00:59:37,953 --> 00:59:40,689
Said I match a description
to this robbery.

846
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:45,094
I know what the description was.

847
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:53,836
Black male... 18 to 40s,
5'6'' to 6'8''.

848
00:59:53,869 --> 00:59:55,437
I've been stopped like 20 times,

849
00:59:55,471 --> 00:59:57,773
and I didn't commit any robbery.

850
00:59:58,374 --> 01:00:00,075
I was sick of it.

851
01:00:01,443 --> 01:00:03,078
So I kept walking.

852
01:00:07,283 --> 01:00:09,785
Said a few choice words...

853
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,955
pushed off of them.

854
01:00:17,092 --> 01:00:19,962
Next thing I knew
I was waking up in the hospital.

855
01:00:21,397 --> 01:00:23,165
But I filed a notice of claim...

856
01:00:25,134 --> 01:00:26,869
sued the city...

857
01:00:28,137 --> 01:00:31,040
and got a big ass settlement
and I moved down here.

858
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:34,076
And I rescued Janet.

859
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,915
Feels like dirty money.

860
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:44,019
Like I took something
that ain't belong to me.

861
01:00:45,421 --> 01:00:47,022
You know what I mean?

862
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:51,794
I do.

863
01:00:56,065 --> 01:00:57,233
I do.

864
01:01:02,338 --> 01:01:03,539
Okay, Ray...

865
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:05,241
Oh... Oh, that's a hole.

866
01:01:08,944 --> 01:01:10,179
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

867
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:11,847
I'm sorry,
it was my fucking fault.

868
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,982
I'm sorry.

869
01:01:14,183 --> 01:01:15,918
I was trying to do something
to give us a shot.

870
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,787
Shut the fuck up!
Jesus.

871
01:01:18,821 --> 01:01:20,322
You did what you had to do,
and you did good.

872
01:01:20,356 --> 01:01:22,925
- So hold it, alright?
- I'm sorry.

873
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,560
If we get outta this,

874
01:01:24,594 --> 01:01:27,329
I'll recommend you
for any damn unit you want.

875
01:01:27,363 --> 01:01:32,001
Except Warrants. Fuck Warrants.

876
01:01:40,943 --> 01:01:43,045
Wow. That hurts.

877
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:45,582
- Are you okay?
- Okay, let's go.

878
01:01:45,615 --> 01:01:47,249
Okay...

879
01:01:56,525 --> 01:01:59,795
We'll go floor by floor
until we find him.

880
01:02:00,396 --> 01:02:02,998
What happened to them?

881
01:02:03,032 --> 01:02:05,034
Well, he's not taking a nap.

882
01:02:07,136 --> 01:02:09,204
Alright, you ready?

883
01:02:09,238 --> 01:02:12,408
Not really, but,
hey, what else are we gonna do?

884
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:13,542
Where's my vest?

885
01:02:15,077 --> 01:02:17,913
Fat lotta good that did, huh?

886
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:19,982
They don't make it big enough,
do they?

887
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:22,885
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Yeah.

888
01:02:22,918 --> 01:02:24,453
Let's go.

889
01:02:27,056 --> 01:02:28,357
Okay...

890
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:47,409
Ray!

891
01:02:50,379 --> 01:02:53,549
Get up! Now! Get up.

892
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,519
I'll shoot you in the fucking head.
Get up.

893
01:02:57,553 --> 01:02:58,854
Get up!

894
01:03:02,024 --> 01:03:03,325
Move!

895
01:03:24,546 --> 01:03:27,617
Go in there.
In there.

896
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:05,287
Dad.

897
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:09,024
- Hey.
- Oh, shit.

898
01:04:09,057 --> 01:04:11,193
Hi, sweetie. Hi.

899
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:15,264
I've been looking
for you two all over.

900
01:04:15,297 --> 01:04:16,999
Where you been?

901
01:04:17,032 --> 01:04:21,003
Hey, Cardillo, these clowns
are pretty heavy tooled up.

902
01:04:21,036 --> 01:04:22,538
Be careful alright?

903
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:24,473
I'd appreciate it if you could
cap a couple of them, too.

904
01:04:24,506 --> 01:04:26,508
Sons a bitch...

905
01:04:26,542 --> 01:04:28,076
It's okay...

906
01:04:31,547 --> 01:04:32,715
Hey, honey...

907
01:04:32,749 --> 01:04:34,283
Honey, don't.
No, honey, stop.

908
01:04:34,316 --> 01:04:36,318
- Relax.
- I have too many holes in me.

909
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,987
Just sit with me for a sec, huh?

910
01:04:39,021 --> 01:04:40,422
Please, sit with me for a sec.

911
01:04:46,428 --> 01:04:49,064
Good shooting.

912
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:54,203
I saw you down there.
Good work.

913
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:00,108
Hold my hand, darling.
Hold my hand.

914
01:05:00,142 --> 01:05:02,144
Yeah, that's good.

915
01:05:09,786 --> 01:05:11,186
Come here.

916
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:47,523
We gotta go.

917
01:05:55,364 --> 01:05:56,599
Um...

918
01:06:03,873 --> 01:06:05,708
I love you, Dad.

919
01:06:40,475 --> 01:06:42,177
Hey...

920
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:44,413
Will you let me know
how it feels

921
01:06:44,446 --> 01:06:47,249
for a bullet
to go through your skin...

922
01:06:48,517 --> 01:06:50,252
and into your brain?

923
01:06:53,221 --> 01:06:56,826
Why don't you go
and fuck yourself?

924
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:16,779
You know where your partner is?

925
01:07:22,819 --> 01:07:24,621
How about the old man?

926
01:07:27,222 --> 01:07:28,691
It was worth a shot.

927
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:38,567
<i>Adam-Boy-Charlie.
Over. Do you copy?</i>

928
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,582
Is it over?

929
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,587
We're in the eye of the storm.

930
01:08:04,894 --> 01:08:06,294
Open up.

931
01:08:07,362 --> 01:08:08,631
It's safe.

932
01:08:09,699 --> 01:08:10,833
Alright.

933
01:08:12,602 --> 01:08:13,803
We need weapons.

934
01:08:13,836 --> 01:08:15,772
Guns, knives,
anything that kills.

935
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:17,874
Hey, we're in the fucking
same boat now, huh...

936
01:08:17,907 --> 01:08:20,610
Yeah...
And your father?

937
01:08:25,982 --> 01:08:28,751
It was getting real dark
in here for a minute.

938
01:08:30,787 --> 01:08:32,454
Are you okay?

939
01:08:38,695 --> 01:08:40,963
We should get out of here.

940
01:08:43,966 --> 01:08:47,603
"Poppy Flowers."

941
01:08:47,637 --> 01:08:50,673
Vincent Van Gogh,
$55 million.

942
01:08:50,707 --> 01:08:53,609
It's here in this building.

943
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:01,851
<i>Officer Cardillo.</i>

944
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,689
This is Cardillo.

945
01:09:06,723 --> 01:09:10,425
<i>I'm here with your partner,
Officer Pena.</i>

946
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:13,730
Is she okay?

947
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:17,365
Say hello.

948
01:09:18,835 --> 01:09:21,303
I'm okay.
I'm okay, Cardillo.

949
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,778
I'm sure you can see,
we've hit a lull in the storm.

950
01:09:28,811 --> 01:09:32,481
<i>Which gives us about 15 minutes
to finish our business</i>

951
01:09:32,514 --> 01:09:33,983
and safely exit.

952
01:09:34,016 --> 01:09:37,419
I would suggest
for Officer Pena's sake,

953
01:09:37,452 --> 01:09:40,455
that you refrain
from calling for back-up.

954
01:09:45,527 --> 01:09:47,262
<i>Officer Cardillo...</i>

955
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:52,501
I haven't called.

956
01:09:52,534 --> 01:09:55,905
<i>Then I'll keep this simple
for expediency.</i>

957
01:09:55,938 --> 01:10:00,610
<i>I want you,
the old man and the art.</i>

958
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:13,823
I can't finish this here.

959
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:17,559
- What is it?
- He's bleeding out.

960
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:19,629
I gotta get him to a hospital,
now.

961
01:10:20,562 --> 01:10:22,031
<i>Officer?</i>

962
01:10:26,869 --> 01:10:28,905
You can have me and the art...

963
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:34,777
<i>but you have to release
Officer Pena.</i>

964
01:10:36,746 --> 01:10:39,381
That's so cliché. So cliché.

965
01:10:39,414 --> 01:10:41,951
You know, I figured
you were the smart one.

966
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:43,853
Aww...

967
01:10:43,886 --> 01:10:46,454
Come to apartment 44A.

968
01:10:46,989 --> 01:10:48,825
<i>Leave your guns.</i>

969
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:50,358
If you're not here
in five minutes,

970
01:10:50,392 --> 01:10:51,594
I'll execute your partner

971
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:53,361
and throw her out
the fucking window.

972
01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:56,732
<i>Don't make the same mistake
you made in New York.</i>

973
01:11:01,503 --> 01:11:03,039
How do you know about that?

974
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:04,874
I know everything.

975
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:07,409
I'm John the Baptist.

976
01:11:20,189 --> 01:11:21,757
Where are they?

977
01:11:24,492 --> 01:11:26,162
Where the fuck are they?

978
01:11:26,195 --> 01:11:31,601
- I... I don't know.
- Don't you fucking lie to me.

979
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:36,138
They came here looking for you.

980
01:11:36,172 --> 01:11:38,741
Did you hear what
he said they're gonna do?

981
01:11:38,774 --> 01:11:40,843
They're gonna fucking kill Pena,

982
01:11:40,877 --> 01:11:43,813
and then they're gonna
hunt us down.

983
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:46,015
This storm is gonna
start back up,

984
01:11:46,048 --> 01:11:49,185
and then we're gonna be trapped.

985
01:11:49,218 --> 01:11:52,588
They'll be shooting fish
in a fucking barrel.

986
01:12:04,634 --> 01:12:09,471
They have been in my family
since the war.

987
01:12:10,673 --> 01:12:13,943
- Are you a Nazi?
- No.

988
01:12:17,647 --> 01:12:19,916
My father was.

989
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:26,454
And he passed
these paintings to me.

990
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:31,060
That's blood money.

991
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:35,563
Are they in the building?

992
01:12:36,999 --> 01:12:38,634
Are they in
the fucking building?

993
01:12:38,668 --> 01:12:40,136
Tell him!

994
01:12:48,644 --> 01:12:50,046
Two minutes.

995
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,483
Here.

996
01:12:56,085 --> 01:12:57,119
Take this.

997
01:12:57,153 --> 01:12:59,121
- Why?
- You're gonna need it.

998
01:12:59,155 --> 01:13:00,723
What about you?

999
01:13:00,756 --> 01:13:02,725
We're gonna go on up there
and finish this.

1000
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:05,127
- Okay.
- I know you know how to shoot.

1001
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:10,066
You get out when you can.

1002
01:13:10,099 --> 01:13:11,167
Both of you.

1003
01:13:12,735 --> 01:13:13,736
Hey...

1004
01:13:19,709 --> 01:13:21,744
Don't take the scaffolding.

1005
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:27,650
Yeah.

1006
01:13:34,924 --> 01:13:36,859
All right, buddy.

1007
01:13:36,892 --> 01:13:37,994
Let's go.

1008
01:13:39,028 --> 01:13:40,863
Okay.

1009
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:42,564
Come on.

1010
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:43,632
We gotta keep moving.

1011
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:44,767
Come on.

1012
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:16,665
One minute.

1013
01:14:34,784 --> 01:14:36,952
Where is it?

1014
01:14:36,986 --> 01:14:40,022
- Let her go first.
- I don't think so.

1015
01:14:40,056 --> 01:14:41,690
Where is it?

1016
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:10,319
C'mon, forward.

1017
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:13,789
Open that door, slowly.

1018
01:15:17,093 --> 01:15:18,661
Slowly.

1019
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:26,035
You moved it all in here, cool?

1020
01:15:27,303 --> 01:15:32,341
Ray was the only person
I trusted.

1021
01:15:33,342 --> 01:15:35,144
It's that way.

1022
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:48,257
After you.

1023
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,126
And if there's anything
other that art

1024
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,927
on the other side
of that door...

1025
01:15:52,928 --> 01:15:54,363
Yeah, I know.

1026
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:04,907
Go in.

1027
01:16:59,929 --> 01:17:01,163
Wow.

1028
01:17:04,233 --> 01:17:05,901
See that?

1029
01:17:09,939 --> 01:17:11,974
Don't!

1030
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:20,416
Please...
take the paintings down.

1031
01:17:29,225 --> 01:17:31,126
Let me get the keys to your van.

1032
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,396
- Oh, not my ride.
- Give me the keys to your van.

1033
01:17:43,005 --> 01:17:44,406
Take off your uniform.

1034
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:48,244
I just met you.

1035
01:17:48,277 --> 01:17:50,779
Yeah, we're gonna get
a lot closer now.

1036
01:17:52,314 --> 01:17:55,351
Hey... Hey.

1037
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:56,819
You got this?

1038
01:18:01,591 --> 01:18:03,259
Let's have a moment.

1039
01:18:06,095 --> 01:18:07,863
Contessa's back.

1040
01:18:14,604 --> 01:18:16,405
Are you satisfied?

1041
01:18:16,438 --> 01:18:18,107
Alright, shut the fuck up.

1042
01:18:19,576 --> 01:18:21,343
I don't know.

1043
01:18:21,377 --> 01:18:23,212
I love the duck room.

1044
01:18:28,851 --> 01:18:30,452
Decoys, right?

1045
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:34,456
Decoys...

1046
01:18:48,337 --> 01:18:50,105
These are decoys?

1047
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:55,878
Does that look like
a fucking masterpiece to you?

1048
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:58,981
No...
You want the real shit?

1049
01:18:59,014 --> 01:19:02,251
Old man Nazi, fuck,
he hid them

1050
01:19:02,284 --> 01:19:04,320
in people's apartments.

1051
01:19:07,657 --> 01:19:12,027
Just hiding them...
right in plain sight.

1052
01:19:17,566 --> 01:19:19,101
Yeah...

1053
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:22,237
Let's go find them.

1054
01:19:24,573 --> 01:19:26,408
Well, you got a way with words.

1055
01:19:26,442 --> 01:19:30,580
- I'll give you that, bro.
- Come.

1056
01:19:30,613 --> 01:19:33,882
- We're cool.
- Don't worry, I'm gonna let you shoot him.

1057
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:35,117
Okay.

1058
01:19:41,023 --> 01:19:42,157
It's okay.

1059
01:19:44,493 --> 01:19:45,628
It's okay.

1060
01:20:10,452 --> 01:20:12,254
Come on!

1061
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,629
Hurry up!

1062
01:20:43,018 --> 01:20:45,988
If there's water coming in
there's a way out.

1063
01:20:47,489 --> 01:20:48,691
Come on, let's do this.

1064
01:20:50,325 --> 01:20:51,628
Shit.

1065
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:57,533
The old man talked
his way into all the apartments?

1066
01:20:58,601 --> 01:21:00,502
Yeah, he owned the building.

1067
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:03,272
Not anymore.

1068
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:34,671
Oh, my God.

1069
01:21:35,705 --> 01:21:38,073
This is the crown jewel.

1070
01:21:38,775 --> 01:21:40,577
"The Concert."

1071
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:43,312
Johannes Vermeer.

1072
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,750
Isabella Stewart Gardner
bought this painting

1073
01:21:47,784 --> 01:21:53,790
at an auction in Paris
in 1892 for $5,000.

1074
01:21:53,823 --> 01:21:58,661
And now it has an
estimated worth; 200 million.

1075
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:03,265
Art sucks.

1076
01:22:05,735 --> 01:22:07,637
Take it down.

1077
01:22:14,176 --> 01:22:16,211
Hey. Carefully.

1078
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:39,636
Okay. Okay.
Hey, look at me.

1079
01:22:39,669 --> 01:22:41,370
Look at me.
We're gonna be okay.

1080
01:22:41,403 --> 01:22:42,772
We're not gonna die.

1081
01:22:42,805 --> 01:22:44,139
- Okay.
- Okay?

1082
01:22:45,207 --> 01:22:46,576
There's gotta be a way
out of here.

1083
01:22:46,609 --> 01:22:49,846
Hey, hey. This...
Hold this light.

1084
01:22:49,879 --> 01:22:51,581
- What are you doing?
- I'm going down.

1085
01:22:51,614 --> 01:22:53,616
Point the light down.
I'm going to find a way out.

1086
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:56,251
Okay.
One, two three.

1087
01:23:06,696 --> 01:23:08,397
Oh, shit.

1088
01:23:25,414 --> 01:23:26,816
What's in there?

1089
01:23:27,584 --> 01:23:28,685
I don't know.

1090
01:23:28,718 --> 01:23:29,786
Nothing.

1091
01:23:31,688 --> 01:23:34,456
That's a lot of locks
for nothing.

1092
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:36,158
Open the door.

1093
01:23:48,938 --> 01:23:52,341
Hey, hey, hey.

1094
01:23:52,909 --> 01:23:54,911
Anything?

1095
01:23:54,944 --> 01:23:57,412
I got you.

1096
01:23:59,582 --> 01:24:00,583
Oh...

1097
01:24:00,617 --> 01:24:02,417
- Anything?
- I found it.

1098
01:24:02,451 --> 01:24:04,252
Take my... Take it.

1099
01:24:04,286 --> 01:24:06,656
- Okay.
- Okay. We're gonna get outta here.

1100
01:24:06,689 --> 01:24:09,626
Here we go.
One, two, three...

1101
01:24:25,307 --> 01:24:27,744
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Open it!

1102
01:24:29,712 --> 01:24:31,146
Alright.

1103
01:24:32,749 --> 01:24:34,316
Suit yourself.

1104
01:25:14,423 --> 01:25:16,659
Knock, knock.

1105
01:25:16,693 --> 01:25:18,795
How we holding up there, sir?

1106
01:25:19,629 --> 01:25:21,329
You doing alright?

1107
01:25:22,965 --> 01:25:24,934
I'm thankful to be alive.

1108
01:25:26,936 --> 01:25:28,705
Thank you, Doc.

1109
01:25:30,272 --> 01:25:32,709
Excuse me, sir.

1110
01:25:32,742 --> 01:25:34,977
Uh, I'm here to take a statement

1111
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:38,915
on an incident that happened at an
apartment building not far from here.

1112
01:25:42,585 --> 01:25:44,386
Who woulda thought...

1113
01:25:44,419 --> 01:25:46,789
that I'd be this happy to see
a cop walk through them doors.

1114
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:52,394
How'd you get out?

1115
01:25:53,462 --> 01:25:55,497
Well, uh...

1116
01:25:56,733 --> 01:26:00,036
I fed your cat
while you were out.

1117
01:26:02,839 --> 01:26:04,941
<i>We have a 10-31 in progress.</i>

1118
01:26:04,974 --> 01:26:06,943
- That's our cue.
- On our way.

1119
01:26:06,976 --> 01:26:12,481
Yeah. Hey, Doc, um,
do you wanna look at my leg?

1120
01:26:12,514 --> 01:26:14,650
Mm, we already played doctor,
didn't we?

1121
01:26:14,684 --> 01:26:16,652
Are you going to take
my stitches out?

1122
01:26:16,686 --> 01:26:18,020
You gonna take me out?

1123
01:26:18,054 --> 01:26:19,989
Bet your sweet ass I am.

1124
01:26:20,022 --> 01:26:23,693
I... I didn't mean it
like that, obviously

1125
01:26:23,726 --> 01:26:25,895
Respect to your,

00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:43,853
Get away!

00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:55,984
'We Are What We Are'

4
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:21,484
Mom's looking for you.

5
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:52,473
Your father hasn't come home.

6
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:03,552
You're going to have to open up.

7
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,091
What are you waiting for?

8
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:14,170
What about Sabina?

9
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:17,538
Sabina will stay here
and fix the clocks.

10
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:31,142
Cut it out!

11
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:35,041
ls my watch ready?

12
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:36,512
Good morning,
could you tell me...

13
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:38,310
Don't tell me you don't have it!

14
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,853
Your father promised it to me
three weeks ago.

15
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,163
Could you tell me
which one's yours?

16
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,698
lt's a gold Mido.

17
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,698
What are you laughing at, punk?

18
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,471
Julian!

19
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,220
Sabina!

20
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,330
Sabina!

21
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:11,136
That's the second time, kiddo.

22
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:12,540
Where's your old man?

23
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:14,908
He owes me for weeks.
You're way behind!

24
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,412
He won't be long.

25
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,348
No, l think you'd better
take your shit and go!

26
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:22,352
Come on, asshole!
Go for it!

27
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:27,386
Pack up your shit
or l'll throw it out!

28
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:34,059
Now what?

29
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,155
''Now what?''

30
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:37,428
What do you mean?
What are we going to tell Mom?

31
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,300
The truth. They kicked us out
because Dad didn't pay the bill.

32
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:44,171
No, they kicked us out
because you're always fighting!

33
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:46,141
Don't defend him.

34
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:49,078
They kicked us out
because he didn't pay.

35
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:54,818
lt was your fault.

36
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,912
They kicked us out because
Dad spends all day with whores.

37
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:18,139
What are you doing here?

38
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,579
What happened, Alfredo?

39
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:29,015
We got kicked out of the market.

40
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:31,021
What?

41
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:35,856
They changed managers.
Someone else is fixing watches.

42
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:39,453
Julian come here!

43
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:42,056
- Now what?
- What happened?

44
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:45,534
- l told you, Mom.
- l'm not asking you!

45
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:48,469
The damn woman went berserk!

46
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:50,337
What did you do?

47
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,467
Nothing, we were working
and she kicked us out.

48
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:55,911
- Right! Just like that!
- Yes, just like that.

49
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:58,107
The only job your father can do

50
00:10:58,216 --> 00:11:00,047
and you blow it!

51
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:01,346
We didn't do anything.

52
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,115
Do you think l'm dumb or what?

53
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:28,208
Who took my key
from the flower pot?

54
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:52,030
They told me
someone died at the mall...

55
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,602
The man who looked
at the mannequins.

56
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,735
Dad's dead!

57
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:59,391
Damn his addiction to whores!

58
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,495
Those bitches killed him!

59
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:06,730
Bitches!

60
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,299
What are we going to do?

61
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:48,669
Are we going to carry on?

62
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,708
- We have to go on as usual.
- We can't go on without Dad.

63
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,481
Don't talk bullshit!

64
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:59,347
We have to, Alfredo.

65
00:14:59,457 --> 00:15:00,981
We have to get
something for tomorrow.

66
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:07,393
What are we supposed to do?

67
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,490
Mom locked herself up
in her room.

68
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:10,727
Dad is lost.

69
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:12,895
Dead.

70
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:14,733
Dad is dead.

71
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,331
- How do you know?
- Didn't you hear what l said?

72
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:19,273
lt could be anyone.

73
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,503
Did they confirm it?

74
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,876
- Who?
- The people from the mall.

75
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:24,881
Who are they?
How do you know them?

76
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:26,848
You're out of it.

77
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:29,785
Remember who you're talking to.

78
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:36,819
lt can't be.

79
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:38,828
We have to wait for him.

80
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,455
No, he'd have been home by now.

81
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,158
You act like you're glad.

82
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:46,396
- Shut up, asshole!
- You shut up, you stupid shit!

83
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:12,460
There's nothing.

84
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:16,357
You'd better find something.

85
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:19,960
From now on, it's up to you.

86
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,950
Mom...
Are you ok?

87
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,720
What shall we do?

88
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:41,087
Mom?

89
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,091
Whatever happens,
we have to get something.

90
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:48,187
We have to go now.

91
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,961
We've never done it
in the daylight.

92
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:51,228
lt can't be that hard
if he did it.

93
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:52,462
Don't talk about Dad like that!

94
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,162
- Shut up, faggot!
- Stop it.

95
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:57,541
Let's go to the corner.

96
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,906
- Mom won't like that.
- lt's the easiest.

97
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:02,673
No. Too risky.

98
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:08,084
Why not go to the bridge?

99
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:10,711
We have to get something
by tomorrow.

100
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,847
Then we can figure out
what to do.

101
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:22,590
What are you waiting for?

102
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:25,192
You're the one who has to do it.

103
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,822
Damn, Tito!

104
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:48,359
Over the years,
you've become a master!

105
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,829
Yeah, my technique's improved.

106
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:54,990
Look,

107
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,298
l'm giving him texture, color,
covering up the scar...

108
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:02,396
You have to...
you know?

109
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:07,174
You have to be a fucking artist.

110
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:08,939
But don't put too much effort
into this one.

111
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,912
We're cremating him.

112
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:13,507
What?

113
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:16,883
Fuck! Why didn't you tell me?

114
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:20,446
l wouldn't have
made the asshole up so nice.

115
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,356
God rest his soul!

116
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:25,725
Nobody respects my work
around here.

117
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,422
Why didn't you tell me?
You...

118
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:28,931
Why didn't you tell me?

119
00:18:37,108 --> 00:18:39,042
Why did you send for us?

120
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:42,136
l thought
this would interest you.

121
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,613
What?

122
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:46,274
A cold one?

123
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:49,376
Not a cold one.

124
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:57,825
This guy came in from a mall.

125
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,092
He died of poisoning.

126
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:06,466
l did a spectacular job on him.

127
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,801
First-rate job.

128
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,406
Don't you think?

129
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,211
l performed an autopsy

130
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:22,309
and found something
very interesting.

131
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,328
You've no idea how many people
come in here chewed up.

132
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:39,836
lt's shocking how many people
eat each other in this city.

133
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:42,372
ln the reports
they blame the rats.

134
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,806
But it's the two-legged kind.

135
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,946
''One night, a city rat...''

136
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:54,280
Well, this old man isn't going
to be eating anyone else.

137
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:55,545
What good is he to us?

138
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,678
You could investigate
who he ate.

139
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:00,724
We don't solve old cases.

140
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,953
What's more,
we don't solve new ones either.

141
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:07,361
But this case will make us
famous, make us rich!

142
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:10,366
Us?
Sounds like a crowd to me.

143
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:13,494
But thanks for the trinket.

144
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,072
All these assholes are the same.

145
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:20,338
They just go on forever.

146
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,693
- Wait.
- What?

147
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:51,565
We have to do something
or we're screwed.

148
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,612
Wait until it's quieter.

149
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,942
No, we can't wait.

150
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,038
You know what happens

151
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,812
if we don't have someone
by tomorrow?

152
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,130
Julian!

153
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,231
- Help!
- Julian!

154
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:33,747
Let's go! Let's go!

155
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:36,046
Get him! Get him!

156
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:04,573
What happened?

157
00:22:04,682 --> 00:22:07,082
lt's Mom.

158
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,289
What did you do?

159
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:20,496
We went to get someone.

160
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:22,293
What?

161
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:27,461
Are you idiots?

162
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,532
Your father dies
and you go out hunting?

163
00:22:33,544 --> 00:22:35,842
You put the family at risk,
Alfredo.

164
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:37,039
We did it for the ritual.

165
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,581
The ritual?

166
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:40,241
What do you know
about the ritual?

167
00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:45,112
lf you knew so much,
you'd know what comes next.

168
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:47,748
We have to pick a leader.

169
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,459
That's next.

170
00:22:51,462 --> 00:22:54,795
Next we start shaking,
because we're going to die.

171
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:52,822
Do you know what Mom meant?

172
00:23:52,924 --> 00:23:55,757
We have to get something
for tomorrow.

173
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:06,596
You're the oldest, Alfredo.

174
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:09,537
You must take Dad's place.

175
00:24:11,476 --> 00:24:12,738
And if l don't want to?

176
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:16,847
lt's not about wanting.

177
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:18,813
You're the most capable...

178
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,440
the most sensitive...

179
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:22,917
the most balanced.

180
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,750
l couldn't even catch a kid.

181
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:31,054
According to what Dad taught us,
you're the next one.

182
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:33,255
You have to keep
the ritual going

183
00:24:33,364 --> 00:24:35,855
and lead the family.

184
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,698
l can't.

185
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:41,635
You have to, Alfredo.

186
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:43,900
Mom loses her temper.

187
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:46,135
- She puts us at risk.
- Mom always knows what to do.

188
00:24:46,244 --> 00:24:48,144
Yeah?

189
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:51,374
She's still locked in her room.

190
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:54,383
We're in real trouble
and she does nothing.

191
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:57,352
Just scolds you all the time.

192
00:25:01,192 --> 00:25:03,057
Alfredo, look at me.

193
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:05,391
Look at me!

194
00:25:05,496 --> 00:25:07,259
No matter what,
we have to continue.

195
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:09,697
And what should l do?

196
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,731
Julian would be better.

197
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:17,171
Julian's clumsy and violent.

198
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:20,369
Cheat,

199
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,969
deceive people.

200
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:27,718
l can't be the leader,

201
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,947
but l can help you.

202
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:34,582
- Hunt down a whore.
- What?

203
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:36,626
You know Mom hates that.

204
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:38,854
- lt's forbidden.
- Forbidden?

205
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:41,488
Dad used to do it, didn't he?

206
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,033
Mom can't forbid us anything.

207
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:47,400
Now you're the leader.

208
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,097
Get a whore.

209
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:51,573
We'll dress her in my clothes
to fool Mom.

210
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,167
Well?

211
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:01,450
Tell Julian to come.

212
00:26:13,764 --> 00:26:16,255
What's up?

213
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,603
Sabina says to go...

214
00:27:57,501 --> 00:28:00,766
From now on,
you're going to obey Alfredo.

215
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:03,772
You'll get to eat
a whore bite by bite...

216
00:28:03,874 --> 00:28:06,365
Just like Dad.

217
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:24,717
Let's get a whore.

218
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:28,489
What?

219
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,930
Not afraid of Mom anymore?

220
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:32,161
No.

221
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:35,602
We must get someone by tomorrow.

222
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,706
Looking for me?

223
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:45,709
- Who else?
- Yeah?

224
00:29:45,811 --> 00:29:47,540
- What's the deal?
- Let's go, ok?

225
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:49,614
Let's go.

226
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:51,876
No way, honey.

227
00:29:51,983 --> 00:29:53,974
That's more expensive.

228
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:55,917
When has money been a problem?

229
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:59,354
lt's no problem for you,
you're loaded.

230
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:00,948
So let's go.

231
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:03,584
No, let me go.
Let me go.

232
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:06,289
Don't be an asshole!
Let me go!

233
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,561
Julian, what are you doing?

234
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,397
Hurry up!

235
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:21,003
Come on.

236
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:24,742
Leave her!

237
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,785
Let's go, Julian!

238
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,290
Shut her up!

239
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,105
You're such a loser!

240
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:53,371
What should l do?
Kill her?

241
00:30:58,116 --> 00:30:59,879
Calm down, Julian!

242
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,476
Cool it!

243
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:59,066
- What's wrong with you, Julian?
- What do you mean?

244
00:31:59,177 --> 00:32:03,011
What do l mean?
There's a whore in the trunk!

245
00:32:05,817 --> 00:32:07,944
l'm getting food for tomorrow.

246
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,281
Food?

247
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:11,252
You beat the shit out of her
in front of everyone.

248
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:14,621
At least they don't die
in my arms.

249
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,718
You think you're really tough?

250
00:32:19,264 --> 00:32:22,233
l'm not afraid of you.

251
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:25,167
You should be.

252
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,412
Sabina's with Mom.

253
00:34:47,112 --> 00:34:48,807
A whore?

254
00:34:56,621 --> 00:34:58,714
Who do you think you are?

255
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:00,882
Who do you both think you are?

256
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,051
- She's not a whore...
- l'm not an idiot.

257
00:35:03,161 --> 00:35:05,652
So what if she is a whore?

258
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:24,346
We have to prepare her.

259
00:35:43,802 --> 00:35:47,636
lf you scream again,
l'll tear your eyes out!

260
00:36:03,822 --> 00:36:07,155
No! Don't kill me.

261
00:36:12,497 --> 00:36:15,330
Please don't hurt me!

262
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:18,698
You can rape me.
You can both fuck me.

263
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:21,795
Do whatever you want to me.

264
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,341
Let me go.

265
00:37:38,116 --> 00:37:41,517
So today's your lucky day?

266
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:42,916
Don't play dumb.

267
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:46,582
Think l didn't see
the finger in the jar?

268
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:50,388
The nutcases at the morgue
gave it to you, right?

269
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:53,760
You think they called you
so you could solve the case?

270
00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:57,858
Think you're the first ones
those nuts called?

271
00:37:59,103 --> 00:38:02,300
They called everyone before you.

272
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:05,899
You're just a fifth-rate cop.

273
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:16,342
And stop reading that file.
You look ridiculous.

274
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:25,859
Do you have any idea
what would happen

275
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:28,296
if we broke this case?

276
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:33,598
The money we'd make?

277
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:40,073
We'd even meet the President
in his fight against crime.

278
00:38:43,248 --> 00:38:46,308
You have a lot of courage
to lead the family, no?

279
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:50,114
- lt's just that...
- You shut up!

280
00:38:50,221 --> 00:38:53,452
Do you want to go whoring
like Dad?

281
00:38:53,558 --> 00:38:55,753
Then you have to take me
to your whores.

282
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:02,197
Meanwhile, we'll see
what our leader decides for us.

283
00:39:50,915 --> 00:39:54,681
ls being without Dad
going to be like this?

284
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:57,277
l think so.

285
00:41:33,317 --> 00:41:35,979
Where's Alfredo?

286
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,558
Stop!

287
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:22,758
l'm getting off!

288
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:25,859
Getting off!

289
00:42:29,407 --> 00:42:34,242
Stop! l told you
l was getting off, you prick!

290
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:25,810
l was too hard on him.

291
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:31,045
lt's not good for him
to be alone.

292
00:45:32,658 --> 00:45:36,150
But now Alfredo
wants to make all the decisions.

293
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:41,699
As if it mattered right now.

294
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,598
He's trying to do
something for us.

295
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:46,762
To help.

296
00:45:46,872 --> 00:45:48,567
Help!

297
00:45:48,674 --> 00:45:52,838
You think
bringing whores home helps?

298
00:45:52,944 --> 00:45:56,038
lt's hard for him
that Dad isn't here.

299
00:45:56,148 --> 00:45:57,615
He really loved him.

300
00:45:57,716 --> 00:45:59,513
Alfredo isn't the only one
who loved him.

301
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:01,017
l loved him, too.

302
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,677
l have a lot more right
than he does.

303
00:46:02,788 --> 00:46:04,653
You were always complaining
about Dad.

304
00:46:04,756 --> 00:46:07,987
- As if you didn't love him.
- How can you say that?

305
00:46:08,093 --> 00:46:09,993
lt's true.

306
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:13,428
At least Alfredo does something.

307
00:46:13,532 --> 00:46:18,026
Never say l don't do anything
for the family again!

308
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:25,900
Take out the whore's body!

309
00:48:07,612 --> 00:48:10,604
You're paid for.

310
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:41,227
You always defended Alfredo,

311
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:44,365
ever since he was little.

312
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,341
You'd wrap yourselves
in the oilcloth

313
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:50,608
and get under the table
and say you were a taco.

314
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:53,684
Sabina would be left out.

315
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:57,516
You'd say: You are the salsa.

316
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,523
And she'd cry
because she wanted to play.

317
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:03,958
But you'd say:
No, Sabina, you're the salsa.

318
00:50:14,773 --> 00:50:17,241
We're monsters, Julian.

319
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:51,169
You wanted to fuck my sons?

320
00:50:56,748 --> 00:51:00,445
This is what you get
if you mess with my family!

321
00:51:00,552 --> 00:51:02,611
Bitches!

322
00:51:25,777 --> 00:51:27,642
Sure this is it?

323
00:51:27,746 --> 00:51:31,375
That's what the nut
from the morgue said.

324
00:51:31,483 --> 00:51:33,508
All units.

325
00:51:33,618 --> 00:51:37,554
XDF 91 1 .

326
00:51:37,655 --> 00:51:40,954
Acknowledge
if you're receiving.

327
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:44,722
And stop studying that file.
You look ridiculous.

328
00:51:55,206 --> 00:51:57,868
l'll be right back.
Don't move.

329
00:51:57,976 --> 00:52:01,844
These wolves
will gobble you up.

330
00:53:29,434 --> 00:53:32,926
l don't care about life

331
00:53:33,037 --> 00:53:37,133
l don't care

332
00:53:37,242 --> 00:53:44,978
About its suffering

333
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:50,852
Those who have nothing

334
00:53:50,955 --> 00:53:54,789
Don't even cry over love

335
00:53:54,893 --> 00:54:03,301
They are happy

336
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:08,896
All the disappointments

337
00:54:09,007 --> 00:54:13,068
Of a broken soul

338
00:54:13,178 --> 00:54:17,945
Don't hurt or harm you

339
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,414
They make you stronger

340
00:54:29,994 --> 00:54:33,896
Life is so thankless

341
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:37,456
lt places you

342
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:45,408
lt places you

343
00:54:48,246 --> 00:54:50,874
On bitter paths

344
00:54:50,982 --> 00:54:54,611
Of trouble

345
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:05,357
And suffering

346
00:55:05,597 --> 00:55:09,124
But when the evening

347
00:55:09,234 --> 00:55:13,000
Of our hard life comes

348
00:55:13,104 --> 00:55:16,972
Our mother's voice

349
00:55:20,078 --> 00:55:29,146
ls light, dear light

350
00:55:29,921 --> 00:55:32,788
A long time ago,
l used to sing on this line...

351
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:35,381
to help pay for my son's school.

352
00:55:35,493 --> 00:55:38,360
Now he has a university degree,

353
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:41,364
thanks to you.

354
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:44,264
To thank you in his name,

355
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:47,861
l bring you these messages.

356
00:55:47,972 --> 00:55:51,567
May you find God
in the one l give you.

357
00:55:51,676 --> 00:55:53,303
Here.

358
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:56,175
Maybe that is
what you're looking for.

359
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:07,155
''You are alive.''

360
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,372
l left something inside.

361
00:57:23,267 --> 00:57:25,895
Did you get something?

362
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:40,574
What are you doing?

363
00:57:42,053 --> 00:57:43,748
l brought you Gustavo.

364
00:57:43,855 --> 00:57:46,346
Are you crazy?

365
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,521
This is what we're going to do.

366
00:57:51,629 --> 00:57:55,121
- You don't tell us what to do.
- Shut up, Julian.

367
00:57:58,936 --> 00:58:02,099
l'm not eating a fag!

368
00:58:03,975 --> 00:58:06,842
You'll eat what l tell you to!

369
00:58:09,113 --> 00:58:12,947
Stop it! Stop it!

370
00:58:40,745 --> 00:58:43,179
Who brought this guy?

371
00:58:43,281 --> 00:58:46,876
l did.

372
00:58:46,984 --> 00:58:51,318
From now on,
l decide what the family does.

373
00:58:52,457 --> 00:58:55,449
Say that again!

374
00:59:00,498 --> 00:59:04,332
From now on,
l decide what the family does.

375
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:11,737
- l'm going to decide...
- Shut up!

376
00:59:11,843 --> 00:59:15,335
Why do you hate me so much?

377
00:59:15,446 --> 00:59:17,880
Why have you always hated me?

378
00:59:17,982 --> 00:59:20,849
Why do you always push me away?

379
00:59:20,952 --> 00:59:23,682
Why did you make me like this?

380
00:59:23,788 --> 00:59:25,756
l did nothing.
You were born that way.

381
00:59:25,857 --> 00:59:28,519
That's not true!

382
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:47,234
What do you want
to kill these assholes?

383
01:00:50,942 --> 01:00:52,534
What are you waiting for?

384
01:00:52,643 --> 01:00:54,167
lf l solve this case,
l'll be promoted

385
01:00:54,278 --> 01:00:56,143
and l can forget about
the shit on the streets.

386
01:00:56,247 --> 01:00:58,408
You don't want money?

387
01:01:06,457 --> 01:01:10,154
Look at this little morsel.

388
01:01:10,261 --> 01:01:13,424
That's for politicians
or businessmen, no?

389
01:01:13,531 --> 01:01:16,364
You're getting moralistic!

390
01:01:37,321 --> 01:01:40,813
lf you want us to follow you,
you must be right.

391
01:01:44,762 --> 01:01:47,253
lt's almost time.
We have to begin the ritual.

392
01:01:47,365 --> 01:01:49,833
- Leave me alone.
- You okay?

393
01:01:49,934 --> 01:01:53,335
Leave me alone.

394
01:01:53,437 --> 01:01:56,099
Where's the faggot?

395
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:20,081
Officer,
they're hunting me down!

396
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:23,319
They want to eat me!

397
01:03:24,295 --> 01:03:30,825
They have a white car...

398
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:34,666
All units, we have a 1 4
in progress.

399
01:03:38,442 --> 01:03:40,205
All units,

400
01:03:40,311 --> 01:03:44,077
we have a 1 4 in progress
in the project.

401
01:03:44,181 --> 01:03:46,775
They caught your cannibals.

402
01:03:46,884 --> 01:03:48,909
They're in the Bicentennial
project.

403
01:04:09,807 --> 01:04:13,766
- ls the entrance on the avenue?
- Here, take a right!

404
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:20,776
HQ, this is unit 7 66...

405
01:04:22,253 --> 01:04:24,619
We're going to solve this shit
on our own.

406
01:05:15,472 --> 01:05:19,670
You're going to waste them,
aren't you?

407
01:05:19,777 --> 01:05:22,473
To teach them a lesson.

408
01:09:10,408 --> 01:09:12,501
Stop!

409
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,976
Easy now!

410
01:09:20,785 --> 01:09:23,515
Put the weapon down, man.

411
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:25,919
You're kidding!

412
01:09:26,024 --> 01:09:27,753
Drop the gun!

413
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:31,260
l'm police, damn it.

414
01:09:31,362 --> 01:09:33,227
Careful, man!

415
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:37,562
Easy, easy!

416
01:09:57,856 --> 01:09:59,721
Fuck!

417
01:14:23,454 --> 01:14:24,580
What happened?

418
01:14:24,689 --> 01:14:27,658
- A cop got in.
- What?

419
01:14:32,196 --> 01:14:33,493
We have to flee.

420
01:14:33,598 --> 01:14:36,465
No! We have to go on.
lt's the only way to stop it.

421
01:14:36,567 --> 01:14:38,535
We can't keep going,
Mom, we have to...

422
01:14:38,636 --> 01:14:40,433
lf we do the ritual,
everything will be alright.

423
01:14:40,538 --> 01:14:42,267
Trust me.

424
01:14:42,373 --> 01:14:44,568
Let's eat this one.
lt's the only way to stop it.

425
01:14:44,675 --> 01:14:46,575
- Mom.
- We're running out of time.

426
01:14:46,677 --> 01:14:47,871
Look at me!

427
01:14:47,979 --> 01:14:50,243
We have to go.
We can't do it now.

428
01:14:50,348 --> 01:14:52,578
We can't do it now.

429
01:14:54,018 --> 01:14:55,986
Come on!

430
01:14:56,087 --> 01:14:58,920
We have to escape from the roof.

431
01:16:05,556 --> 01:16:08,889
We have to get to the roof.
Come on!

432
01:16:19,704 --> 01:16:21,672
We'll go across the roof.

433
01:16:28,312 --> 01:16:30,337
Come on!

434
01:16:30,448 --> 01:16:34,248
They're going to kill them.
Come on!

435
01:16:42,393 --> 01:16:44,293
lt's for the ritual.

436
01:16:44,395 --> 01:16:46,829
Someone has to survive...

437
01:16:46,931 --> 01:16:48,660
for the ritual!

438
01:18:18,756 --> 01:18:21,316
No! Let her go!

439
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:32,696
Leave her alone!

440
01:19:56,153 --> 01:19:58,883
All units report,
send paramedics.

441
01:19:58,989 --> 01:20:01,822
We have one survivor.

442
01:21:05,589 --> 01:21:08,456
''You are alive!''

443
01:23:40,144 --> 01:23:43,443
''We Are What We Are''

444
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,086

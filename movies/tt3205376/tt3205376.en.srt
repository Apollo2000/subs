2
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:14,806
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

3
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:17,826
<i>1870 to be exact,</i>

4
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:19,677
<i>a 16-year-old kid</i>

5
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:22,580
<i>traveled from the cold shoulder
of Scotland</i>

6
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,785
<i>to the baking heart of America
to find his love.</i>

7
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:29,388
<i>His name was Jay.</i>

8
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:32,057
<i>Her name was Rose.</i>

9
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:39,197
Pegasus...

10
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:42,167
The Great Bear...

11
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:45,303
The Dragon...

12
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:48,718
Andromeda...

13
00:02:03,488 --> 00:02:05,557
Orion's belt.

14
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,770
<i>I was drifting West</i>

15
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,872
<i>when I picked up his trail</i>

16
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:10,842
<i>deep in Colorado territory.</i>

17
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:15,513
<i>A jackrabbit in a den of wolves.</i>

18
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:18,750
<i>Fortunate to be alive.</i>

19
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:26,819
Arms abroad, boy.

20
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:29,120
Red skin or white?

21
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:34,626
Sir... I'm British... Scottish.

22
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,729
Catch the savage.

23
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,577
I'm Jay Cavendish...

24
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:55,346
son of Lady Cavendish.

25
00:06:55,446 --> 00:06:58,583
We're all sons of bitches.

26
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:07,474
Grave play, boy.

27
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:11,731
Sir... lower your pistol.

28
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,345
Hey.

29
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:43,953
Clean it, oil it.

30
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:59,677
What do you want?

31
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:10,598
He was an officer.

32
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:14,058
Wearing a dress don't make her a lady.

33
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,432
They ain't soldier.

34
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:23,339
Least no more.

35
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,600
Injun slayers.

36
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,447
Keep headin' West solo,
you'll be dead by dawn.

37
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:37,615
How you made it this far is a miracle.

38
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:40,586
- I take care of myself.
- Sure, kid.

39
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:44,834
You need chaperoning,
and I'm a chaperone.

40
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,706
- Safer to travel with a killer?
- That's right.

41
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:57,327
First let's save your pony's life.

42
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:04,442
Counted a dozen of them bastards
attacked those Indians back there.

43
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:06,511
Minus three...

44
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:08,980
that leaves too many.

45
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:30,501
"Ho for the West...

46
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:32,737
A Traveler and Emigrant's Handbook...

47
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:35,406
to Canada and the North West
States of America"

48
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:37,241
by Edward Hepple Hall.

49
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:39,644
Well, ho for the West.

50
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,650
Dollars... fifty now,
fifty when we split.

51
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:00,264
Until we reach a forest
called Silver Ghost.

52
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:08,239
Let's drift.

53
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:40,538
- What's your name?
- Drop back. Single file.

54
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:52,971
Why are you headin' West?

55
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:02,093
You care not why I'm headed West?

56
00:11:02,793 --> 00:11:04,328
There was an accident.

57
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:07,632
My girl and her father
fled from Scotland...

58
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,734
settled out West.

59
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,136
It was all my fault.

60
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:14,533
Take a hint, kid?

61
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:19,477
- We love each other.
- Sure you do, kid.

62
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:26,818
Jay!

63
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:31,124
A thousand ways to die... choose one.

64
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,161
Bow and arrow.

65
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,170
Silly boy.

66
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:23,507
My turn.

67
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:50,795
<i>That kid was a wonder.</i>

68
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:54,463
<i>He saw things differently.</i>

69
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:59,770
<i>To him, we were in a land
of hope and good will.</i>

70
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:05,609
<i>The way I saw it...</i>

71
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:08,946
<i>kick over any rock
and most likely a desperado</i>

72
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:13,551
<i>will crawl out and knife you right
in the heart if there was a dollar in it.</i>

73
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:58,162
Same stars, same moon...

74
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:03,634
One day we'll be wanderin'
'round that moon.

75
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:06,751
They'll build a railroad.

76
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:09,907
A railroad up and down the ways.

77
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:17,342
A railroad to the moon.

78
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,851
And when we get there...

79
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:23,354
the first thing we'll do...

80
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:26,056
is hunt the natives down.

81
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:29,260
No Indians on the moon.

82
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:38,313
No, the natives of the moon.
The moon people.

83
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:53,684
Pegasus...

84
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:57,521
The Great Bear...

85
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,017
The Dragon...

86
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,606
Sit down.

87
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:49,374
This is the last time
I'm gonna clean up your shit.

88
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:48,766
It must have been winter
when Rose passed through here.

89
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:50,401
What's she like?

90
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:54,695
She's a beauty.

91
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:58,175
And she does not waste words.

92
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:01,394
They tumble out... wit following wisdom.

93
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,950
You haven't bedded her, have you?

94
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:10,621
Grab that end.

95
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:12,489
You're a brute.

96
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:36,346
Trading post up ahead.

97
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:39,950
We can dine at a table
while sittin' on a chair.

98
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:11,415
Tie the horses 'round back.

99
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:26,096
<i>Everyone knew about the bounty...</i>

100
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:28,266
<i>except Jay.</i>

101
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,540
<i>He was leading me right to it.</i>

102
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:55,159
<i>There were few of us left.</i>

103
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,728
<i>Men beyond the law.</i>

104
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:03,367
<i>But the most dangerous
are the last to fall.</i>

105
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:11,709
May I ask you to place your iron
on the counter while you browse?

106
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:21,585
We'll be dining.

107
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:34,932
- May I try on a suit?
- Sure, be my guest.

108
00:20:50,547 --> 00:20:52,416
Whiskey?

109
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:57,321
- Got any meat?
- I got condemned bacon.

110
00:20:57,421 --> 00:21:01,358
Traded it for bullets.
Both'll kill you pretty quick.

111
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:53,477
Blanket, please.

112
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:55,804
Blanket, huh?

113
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:03,854
Ma'am, you have to purchase items
'fore baggin' 'em.

114
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:07,324
How we do it here in America.

115
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:11,361
Johan.

116
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:19,970
Sorry.

117
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,156
Money... please.

118
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:25,168
Well, now, looky here.

119
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:26,943
You realize if I give you money,

120
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:29,231
here's the only place around
where you can spend it.

121
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:32,550
Johan!

122
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:36,445
Money...

123
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,284
Johan... Johan!

124
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:01,277
Breathe.

125
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:07,284
Breathe.

126
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,220
In...

127
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,356
and out.

128
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:15,645
Money.

129
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:22,035
Money!

130
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:24,602
Breathe.

131
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:27,104
In...

132
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:28,438
and out.

133
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:30,240
Money!

134
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:32,376
Breathe.

135
00:23:36,446 --> 00:23:38,448
Money!

136
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:40,484
In...

137
00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:42,855
- and out.
- Money!

138
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,769
Grab some provisions.

139
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:01,071
Jay!

140
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:30,901
Shit.

141
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:01,431
Dry your eyes, kid, let's drift.

142
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:55,159
We could have taken them in.

143
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:58,155
In where?

144
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:26,416
How do you feel...

145
00:26:27,484 --> 00:26:29,486
about me?

146
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:38,128
You're the little brother I never had.

147
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:46,003
You don't mean that.

148
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:50,173
That's not what you mean.

149
00:26:56,313 --> 00:26:58,949
I'm sorry, my Romeo...

150
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:02,418
but "these violent delights...

151
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:04,358
have violent ends."

152
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,723
What choice do you have?

153
00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:10,627
A farmer... a fisherman...

154
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:14,867
Best you leave now, Jay.

155
00:27:19,435 --> 00:27:21,505
- Under the bed.
- No.

156
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:28,144
- Daddy.
- Rose.

157
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:34,749
Growin' up quick.

158
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:40,724
- John, Calum, Rose.
- Willie, Angus.

159
00:28:21,431 --> 00:28:24,034
Lord Cavendish, can I help you?

160
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:26,770
I've come for my nephew.

161
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:34,845
You should not be in here.
These people are peasants.

162
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:52,128
I'm with Rose now.

163
00:30:50,914 --> 00:30:52,849
I come in peace.

164
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:58,688
My ears hear your music.

165
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:00,690
Come. Come.

166
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,859
Come! Come!

167
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:24,647
Sit.

168
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:27,450
I have coffee.

169
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,825
You a writer?

170
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:38,261
Perhaps.

171
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:44,901
I am "Recording the Decline
of the Aboriginal Tribes...

172
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:48,288
Their Customs, Culture and Habits...

173
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:51,675
In the Hope of Preventing
Their Extinction

174
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:56,112
or Conversion to Christianity."

175
00:31:56,212 --> 00:31:59,741
The title of my account.

176
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:04,239
- Too long?
- Perhaps.

177
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:09,659
So, now.

178
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,367
East. What news?

179
00:32:13,229 --> 00:32:14,998
Violence and suffering.

180
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:18,692
And West?

181
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,472
Dreams...

182
00:32:23,073 --> 00:32:25,375
and toil.

183
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:28,645
I passed through burnt remains
of an Indian camp.

184
00:32:31,547 --> 00:32:34,417
This is dreadful news.

185
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:39,856
A race extinct...

186
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:41,825
their culture banished,

187
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:44,060
their places re-named,

188
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,380
only then will they be viewed
with selective nostalgia,

189
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,867
mythologized and romanticized
in the safe guise of art...

190
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:54,771
and literature.

191
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:00,109
This is a new world for us...

192
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,112
also for them.

193
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:10,753
You must be hungry.

194
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:17,227
'Til now, my sole company's
been a brute.

195
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:20,563
Sorry to hear this.

196
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:23,266
I escaped.

197
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,935
Thank you.

198
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:41,951
I killed a woman yesterday.

199
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:46,089
Part and parcel.

200
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:50,660
You care not to share
your company with a murderer?

201
00:33:52,261 --> 00:33:55,131
I'd be a lonely man if I did.

202
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:58,367
I am no judge...

203
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:00,737
nor father.

204
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:04,307
In a short time...

205
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:08,545
this will be a long time ago.

206
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:20,723
Camp here.

207
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,027
- Blanket?
- Thank you.

208
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:34,387
I shall dream up some advice,
and in the morning,

209
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:36,774
dish it up with fresh eggs.

210
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,946
- What's your name?
- Werner.

211
00:34:45,848 --> 00:34:47,972
I'm Jay.

212
00:34:48,317 --> 00:34:50,988
Goodnight, and thank you, Werner.

213
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:27,076
You can eat those.

214
00:37:29,712 --> 00:37:32,215
Eat enough of them, you can fly to Rose.

215
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:35,819
You kill Werner?

216
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:41,124
No.

217
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:42,992
No reason.

218
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:55,705
This is all the money I have.
Get me there in one piece.

219
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:00,543
Sure, kid.

220
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,024
Have a biscuit.

221
00:38:41,384 --> 00:38:43,719
That's just a shame.

222
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,757
Is it?

223
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:50,627
No.

224
00:38:53,095 --> 00:38:55,297
No, it's not.

225
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:00,737
Charles Darwin talks of evolution
by natural selection.

226
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:05,908
For our sake, let's hope he's wrong.

227
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,953
Knife's gotta be as sharp as a razor.

228
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,426
You hold the knife flush
against the skin.

229
00:39:57,526 --> 00:40:01,030
And it's a scraping motion
against the grain.

230
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,833
Not a slicing motion.

231
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:06,902
Like so.

232
00:40:08,337 --> 00:40:10,273
That'll make you presentable for her.

233
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:18,147
I know why you need my help.

234
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:21,917
Oh, yeah?

235
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:24,287
Yeah.

236
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:26,589
You're lonely.

237
00:40:26,856 --> 00:40:29,091
You're a lonely man.

238
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:30,506
Sure, kid.

239
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:32,728
Sure, kid.

240
00:40:32,828 --> 00:40:35,031
Let's drift.

241
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:39,001
The silent, lonely drifter.

242
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:42,872
You're a lonely, lonely man.

243
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:46,184
No need to concern over me.

244
00:40:47,476 --> 00:40:49,678
Hold still.

245
00:40:51,063 --> 00:40:53,449
All I'm sayin' is...

246
00:40:53,549 --> 00:40:55,785
there's more to life
than just survivin'.

247
00:40:55,935 --> 00:40:58,521
Yeah, there's dyin'.

248
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:02,825
Survival ain't just
how to skin a jackrabbit.

249
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:07,229
It's knowing when to bluster
and when to hush.

250
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,166
When to take a beating...

251
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,634
and when to strike.

252
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:21,043
Where's your folks?

253
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:24,430
Father's in the ground in Ireland,

254
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,816
mother's in the ground in Canada.

255
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:29,818
So what keeps you from joining 'em?

256
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,757
I don't know, kid. Quit askin' me shit.

257
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,262
I was fine 'til you showed up.

258
00:41:39,562 --> 00:41:42,321
I showed up? You showed up.

259
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:46,568
Yeah, well, maybe I'm tired
of showin' up.

260
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:53,109
You're done.

261
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:35,151
May I enter?

262
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:37,420
It's a free country.

263
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,122
Try telling the Natives that.

264
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:43,793
I propose a trade, a mug of coffee

265
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:46,392
for the finest imported absinthe

266
00:42:46,492 --> 00:42:49,899
and a cigar of unrivaled quality.

267
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:52,735
We drink tea.

268
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:09,418
One for you, young man.

269
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:24,333
There's still not a mark on you.

270
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:25,835
You know him?

271
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:29,505
- Fuck yourself, Payne.
- I've tried.

272
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:32,608
Believe me, I have tried.

273
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:38,014
Well, that's damn fine coffee.

274
00:43:38,714 --> 00:43:40,583
It's tea.

275
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,362
There you are.

276
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:01,103
To bad times in the green hour.

277
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:04,166
Down it, boy! That's liquid joy!

278
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,388
- You headed West?
- North.

279
00:44:11,013 --> 00:44:14,050
Yeah, I'm headed... South.

280
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,520
Chill, can't stand it, makes my...

281
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,156
makes my joints ache.

282
00:44:29,064 --> 00:44:32,902
So why North, kid? Someone special?

283
00:44:34,637 --> 00:44:37,440
Your sweetheart, maybe?

284
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:42,907
I'm teasing, I'm teasing. I'm teasing.

285
00:44:46,882 --> 00:44:49,920
You must be born on a Sunday?
You born on a Sunday?

286
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:56,692
Yeah? You born on a Sunday?

287
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:58,461
I don't know.

288
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:01,931
So, it's fortunate
that you're... headed North

289
00:45:02,031 --> 00:45:04,500
'cause West...

290
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,991
It's bad, it's big trouble.
Big storm coming.

291
00:45:09,672 --> 00:45:12,174
Easy, Payne. He's just a kid.

292
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:16,412
No, he's not.
He's an outlaw, just like us.

293
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:21,450
Anywho, let's drink.
To friends! Old and new.

294
00:45:33,929 --> 00:45:35,798
Spin it.

295
00:45:39,201 --> 00:45:40,603
That's pretty good.

296
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:49,079
Get that dirt, all of it,
clean, clean it.

297
00:46:07,496 --> 00:46:09,422
I need to piss.

298
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,769
Away from camp.

299
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:24,046
It's easy to see
how you two crossed paths.

300
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:28,951
One's a falling angel,
the other one's a rising devil.

301
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:32,655
I ain't no angel...

302
00:46:34,056 --> 00:46:35,858
True.

303
00:46:38,127 --> 00:46:40,971
Do you think that's a smart play?

304
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,666
Teaming up with him?

305
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:47,102
Quicker than tracking him, simpler.

306
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,673
Ain't no play about it.

307
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,577
Yeah, I guess if you knew
where Rose and Daddy was,

308
00:46:54,677 --> 00:46:56,712
you'd be done babysitting.

309
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:07,222
Never was a bean-spiller, was ya?

310
00:47:07,522 --> 00:47:09,692
Not... sober,

311
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:13,662
nor liquored up, never was.

312
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:18,867
What you gonna do
with two thousand dollars?

313
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,409
Come back to us.

314
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:30,183
I'm not like you, Payne.

315
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:57,974
Silas?

316
00:48:08,684 --> 00:48:11,587
What have you done with Silas And Payne?

317
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:14,223
Back down, kid.

318
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:18,127
Payne needs him alive.
You'll get your chance.

319
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:21,630
What've you done with the river?

320
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,807
They took it.

321
00:48:32,124 --> 00:48:35,511
- Who took it?
- Didn't see their face.

322
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:37,413
Kid.

323
00:48:46,021 --> 00:48:50,859
All I'm saying... is, in my day,
we tried to keep outta the papers.

324
00:48:50,959 --> 00:48:53,862
You youngsters tryin'
to get in 'em makes no sense.

325
00:48:53,962 --> 00:48:58,901
All I'm sayin', Skell,
is I want folks to respect me.

326
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:02,005
What's the point in dyin'
if nobody knows you're dead?

327
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:04,841
Same goes for killing.

328
00:49:10,445 --> 00:49:15,451
I partnered up with a youngling, once
upon a time, by the name of Bill Allson.

329
00:49:16,418 --> 00:49:18,954
He was dying to be famous.

330
00:49:19,054 --> 00:49:21,957
Actually, killing to be famous.

331
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:24,310
He come to me one time, and he said...

332
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,263
<i>I killed 30 men, and countless savages,</i>

333
00:49:28,363 --> 00:49:31,834
<i>and I still ain't got me
no Wanted poster.</i>

334
00:49:31,934 --> 00:49:34,203
<i>Where's the justice in that, I said?</i>

335
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:36,205
<i>So I'm thinking</i>

336
00:49:36,305 --> 00:49:40,242
<i>the only way to stop this kid
from croakin' more innocents</i>

337
00:49:40,342 --> 00:49:44,096
<i>is to draw up a poster. Let him find it.</i>

338
00:49:44,196 --> 00:49:47,651
<i>The next morning, I pinned the poster
outside the waterin' hole</i>

339
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,314
<i>he was drowning in.</i>

340
00:49:49,714 --> 00:49:51,854
<i>Wasn't long before he sees the poster,</i>

341
00:49:51,954 --> 00:49:55,908
<i>"Bill Allson, $500 dead or alive."</i>

342
00:49:56,008 --> 00:49:58,593
- <i>He yells me over.</i>
- Skelly!

343
00:49:58,693 --> 00:50:01,063
<i>And what he says chills me to the bone.</i>

344
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:04,834
- What'd he say?
- "Be a thousand by the 'morrow."

345
00:50:06,335 --> 00:50:10,673
<i>The next morning, I go to get the poster,</i>
<i>and pin it up in the next town.</i>

346
00:50:10,773 --> 00:50:12,741
<i>The poster ain't there.</i>

347
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:16,281
I hear a gunshot and a body hit dirt.

348
00:50:16,912 --> 00:50:20,940
<i>Spin around to see
this mean son of a bitch</i>

349
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,444
<i>leaning over a... blob.</i>

350
00:50:24,753 --> 00:50:27,256
Well, I'm presuming this bastard
seen the poster,

351
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:30,980
thought it real, and gunned down
Bill for the reward.

352
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,855
<i>So I walk and I shoot, and bang!</i>

353
00:50:34,955 --> 00:50:37,632
He falls to his knees and dies.

354
00:50:37,732 --> 00:50:42,571
On his knees, like he's prayin'
to be alive again.

355
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:48,779
As I... walked towards
the dear departed,

356
00:50:49,544 --> 00:50:52,848
<i>Bill Allson steps out
from the saloon across the street.</i>

357
00:50:52,948 --> 00:50:55,358
<i>Alive as you an' I.</i>

358
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:59,214
Bottle of whiskey in one hand,
and the wanted poster in the other.

359
00:50:59,314 --> 00:51:03,659
<i>I step up to the prayin' dead man
and nudge him with my boot.</i>

360
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:08,481
<i>He falls, revealin' a... a dead lump
of fur and meat.</i>

361
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:12,469
It was a goddamned black bear.

362
00:51:14,803 --> 00:51:18,173
- You know what Bill Allson says to me?
- What'd he say?

363
00:51:18,273 --> 00:51:22,878
He says, "You jealous bastard,
trying to get your own poster."

364
00:51:25,414 --> 00:51:27,316
Bullshit!

365
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:29,203
That's a good one, Skelly.

366
00:51:31,386 --> 00:51:35,424
There's been an appalling
misunderstanding.

367
00:51:35,524 --> 00:51:37,492
I'm at the wrong camp.

368
00:51:37,592 --> 00:51:39,671
Goodnight. Good riddance.

369
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:49,037
<i>The good Lord brings the rain</i>

370
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:53,241
<i>To wash away our troubles</i>

371
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:57,245
<i>The devil adds the lightning</i>

372
00:51:57,345 --> 00:52:01,250
<i>To show us he's still near</i>

373
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:04,675
<i>So the good Lord sends some thunder</i>

374
00:52:05,587 --> 00:52:09,157
<i>To warn us of the devil</i>

375
00:52:09,257 --> 00:52:15,063
<i>But the devil's gonna blow us all away</i>

376
00:52:15,163 --> 00:52:19,468
Silas. There's some people in the woods.

377
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:20,875
You love her?

378
00:52:21,903 --> 00:52:24,707
- Who?
- Rose.

379
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:29,379
- Yes.
- Then go home, kid.

380
00:52:30,212 --> 00:52:31,718
She's mine.

381
00:52:32,647 --> 00:52:34,883
She's nobody's.

382
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:47,129
Fighting talk!

383
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:55,804
You're always shushing me!

384
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:03,879
'Cause you're always
running your mouth off.

385
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:25,293
Jay-bird,

386
00:54:25,393 --> 00:54:27,262
why so sad?

387
00:54:27,362 --> 00:54:29,131
Silas!

388
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:31,099
Silas!

389
00:54:32,384 --> 00:54:34,132
Silas!

390
00:54:46,448 --> 00:54:49,784
Silas! I can't find my gun!

391
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:57,071
Son of a bitch! Shit!

392
00:54:58,393 --> 00:55:00,328
Help!

393
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,402
Come in, Kotori.

394
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:45,541
Kotori.

395
00:56:08,263 --> 00:56:10,799
Turned out nice again.

396
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,970
Coffee.

397
00:56:14,703 --> 00:56:18,207
You always asks for coffee,
and you always spits it out.

398
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,522
- For God's sake.
- Language, Rose.

399
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:38,244
An improvement, it stays on the table.

400
00:56:47,135 --> 00:56:49,563
Only thing dry's my mouth.

401
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:53,455
My head is killing me.

402
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:57,045
You remember nothing from last night?

403
00:56:57,779 --> 00:57:00,148
I remember Payne,

404
00:57:00,248 --> 00:57:02,250
then rain.

405
00:57:12,694 --> 00:57:13,858
Give me that rope.

406
00:57:31,112 --> 00:57:33,348
Not bad, kid.

407
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:48,830
<i>I must've been Jay's age
when I joined Payne's gang.</i>

408
00:57:49,564 --> 00:57:53,335
<i>Those were prosperous times
in our trade.</i>

409
00:57:54,269 --> 00:57:58,458
<i>When I split, I was lucky
to do so with my life.</i>

410
00:58:03,244 --> 00:58:05,046
Whoa.

411
00:58:18,593 --> 00:58:20,728
What do they want?

412
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:25,367
They're bounty hunters.
You know what that means?

413
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:30,206
- They hunt bounty.
- They hunt Rose, Daddy, blood, money.

414
00:58:47,355 --> 00:58:50,419
- "Wanted dead or alive..."
- Dead or dead, kid.

415
00:58:57,899 --> 00:59:00,402
And I'm leading them to her.

416
00:59:03,337 --> 00:59:06,240
- We'll lead them South.
- There'll be others.

417
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,876
Others?

418
00:59:07,976 --> 00:59:11,981
Two thousand dollars entices
a certain breed of undesirable.

419
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:15,483
Just what breed are you?

420
00:59:22,223 --> 00:59:26,595
Local tribes call this forest
"The Place of Spirit Trees".

421
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:30,131
Trappers call it "Silver Ghost".

422
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:34,536
Legend has it, folks go in,
they don't come out.

423
00:59:36,104 --> 00:59:39,616
At least we may shed the superstitious
from Payne's company.

424
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:52,858
Oh, God damn you, Silas.

425
01:00:10,338 --> 01:00:12,474
Who be it?

426
01:00:12,907 --> 01:00:14,276
Victor Self.

427
01:00:14,776 --> 01:00:17,045
Reverend Victor Self.

428
01:00:17,145 --> 01:00:20,349
Sorry to bother you, looking
for a chap by the name of Parker.

429
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:24,820
James Parker.

430
01:00:26,087 --> 01:00:30,458
No Parkers here, Minister.
Won't you come in?

431
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,631
Sir, I thank you, but decline.

432
01:00:37,231 --> 01:00:39,034
Rose!

433
01:00:39,934 --> 01:00:41,770
I'm sorry, Minister.

434
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,105
The Good Lord has me on an errand.

435
01:00:44,205 --> 01:00:46,506
Bless you. And your lovely wife.

436
01:00:47,106 --> 01:00:48,676
My daughter.

437
01:00:51,345 --> 01:00:53,348
Good day, Sir.

438
01:01:02,824 --> 01:01:05,346
Heavens above, Rose.

439
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,896
Scotland is far, far away.

440
01:01:08,996 --> 01:01:13,234
Nobody knows where we are.
Nobody knows who we are.

441
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:15,570
He knows I'm your daughter,

442
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:19,656
I'm called Rose,
and he knows we're here.

443
01:01:20,274 --> 01:01:22,950
He was sent by Providence.

444
01:01:24,212 --> 01:01:27,615
The Lord sensed my wavering faith.

445
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:31,386
Rain is coming.

446
01:01:43,965 --> 01:01:47,602
"Thou shall not be afraid
of any terror of night,

447
01:01:48,102 --> 01:01:51,417
nor for the arrow that flyeth by day.

448
01:01:51,517 --> 01:01:54,676
For the pestilence
that waketh in darkness,

449
01:01:54,776 --> 01:01:57,579
nor for the sickness
that destroyeth in noon day."

450
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:00,948
"O'er all there hung the shadow of fear,

451
01:02:01,048 --> 01:02:04,352
a sense of mystery the spirit daunted,

452
01:02:04,452 --> 01:02:07,222
and said as plain
as a whisper in the ear,

453
01:02:08,022 --> 01:02:10,425
this place is haunted."

454
01:02:28,209 --> 01:02:31,747
Silas? The trees are moving.

455
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:40,388
It's called a hangover, kid.
You'll get used to it.

456
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:12,299
Nice catch.

457
01:03:17,124 --> 01:03:19,594
I'll fix you up on the way.

458
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,849
I've made it.

459
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,886
You sure that's them?

460
01:04:55,189 --> 01:04:57,925
Exactly what I imagined.

461
01:05:04,665 --> 01:05:09,049
Hey. Silas! S-Silas!
Silas, what are you doing?

462
01:05:09,149 --> 01:05:13,441
Stop! No! Silas, Silas!

463
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:24,385
Do it quick.

464
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:26,092
I ain't gonna kill you.

465
01:05:27,088 --> 01:05:31,125
I'm keeping you alive.
We don't have a gun between us.

466
01:05:31,225 --> 01:05:32,827
Hold still.

467
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:36,664
- What is this?
- It stops the sun burning you up.

468
01:05:36,764 --> 01:05:41,202
- I'll protect Rose or die trying!
- That's what I'm afraid of.

469
01:05:41,502 --> 01:05:44,740
Lay a finger on her, and I'll kill you!

470
01:06:42,463 --> 01:06:43,891
Dada!

471
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:48,236
Da!

472
01:07:38,385 --> 01:07:41,553
John Ross! Rose Ross! John Ross!

473
01:07:41,653 --> 01:07:45,393
You need to leave this house!
There are men coming here to kill you!

474
01:07:52,233 --> 01:07:53,668
Rose.

475
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:00,074
Easy.

476
01:08:01,242 --> 01:08:02,590
I'm a friend.

477
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:47,822
Kill that house!

478
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:16,444
I know how to do a job right.

479
01:10:16,544 --> 01:10:19,481
Yes, sir, no, sir,
three bags full of sh...

480
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:15,169
Kotori.

481
01:11:16,003 --> 01:11:20,541
<i>I be carried to the sky</i>

482
01:11:21,942 --> 01:11:25,960
<i>On a flowery bed of ease</i>

483
01:11:27,581 --> 01:11:32,619
<i>While others fight to win the prize</i>

484
01:11:41,028 --> 01:11:44,879
<i>And sail the bloody seas</i>

485
01:12:58,906 --> 01:13:01,912
Until civilization arrives.

486
01:14:22,155 --> 01:14:24,024
Kotori.

487
01:14:46,446 --> 01:14:48,782
Rose...

488
01:14:53,353 --> 01:14:55,489
Jay...

489
01:15:24,585 --> 01:15:26,120
Jay.

490
01:15:40,834 --> 01:15:43,371
Silly boy.

491
01:16:07,394 --> 01:16:10,364
Turn around, Rose.

492
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:18,706
It's over.

493
01:16:20,807 --> 01:16:22,709
Doesn't hurt.

494
01:17:05,886 --> 01:17:07,722
Jay.

495
01:17:28,108 --> 01:17:30,926
He loved you with all his heart.

496
01:17:38,685 --> 01:17:41,868

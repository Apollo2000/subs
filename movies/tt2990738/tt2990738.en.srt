1
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:46,756
Morning rush hour traffic
has all cleared up.

2
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:52,428
Vehicles are moving well
on all highways and bridges.

3
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:55,139
One thing to be aware of.

4
00:00:55,139 --> 00:01:00,728
There was a presidential address
at the National Assembly.

5
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:05,191
Streets around the area
will be briefly closed off.

6
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:10,196
Have a great morning!
That's all for the traffic report.

7
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,077
It's 9:31 AM Monday.

8
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,954
This is YOON Young-hwa's
Daily Topic.

9
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:24,126
We're taking callers' opinions
on the new tax reform.

10
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,629
You're on the air.
Hello?

11
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,631
Hello. Good day.

12
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,466
Please introduce yourself.

13
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:35,137
I'm PARK No-kyu from Seoul.
I'm a construction worker.

14
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,931
Hello, Mr. PARK.

15
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:42,645
The biggest controversy is in
less tax for those with high income.

16
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:47,149
What are your thoughts
on this matter?

17
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,151
I live alone.

18
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:53,447
All I have is a TV and a fridge,
but my electricity came to $170!

19
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,699
I called Korea Electric
to complain.

20
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:59,120
- But I must pay or they'll cut...
- Mr. PARK?

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,789
Today's topic is on
the new tax reform.

22
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,251
Right.
Isn't electricity tax, too?

23
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,796
How can the government
do this to a good citizen like me?

24
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,591
'Electricity is tax, too'.
Thank you for your opinion.

25
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:18,139
I can imagine how hard
it must be.

26
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,473
Next caller, please.

27
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,392
Wait! Don't hang up!

28
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,727
Hi, my name is KIM Hee-eun.

29
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,480
Hello, Ms. KIM Hee-eun.

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,568
I watched your news every day.
It's great to talk with you.

31
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:33,154
Thank you.
Your thoughts on the matter?

32
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,406
As a housewife, I think...

33
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,782
Don't hang up!

34
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:41,537
We apologize
for the confusion.

35
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,873
We'll be back after
these commercials.

36
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:47,835
What was that?

37
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,504
Why isn't it getting
disconnected?

38
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,257
- Check the lines.
- Okay.

39
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:56,218
I was talking!
How could you!

40
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,388
What did I do?
Why hang up on me!

41
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,806
Please, sir.

42
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:04,059
Could you hang up
so we can keep the show going?

43
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,855
How can you do that?
So rude!

44
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,149
Treating me like I'm weird!

45
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:14,570
Where'd YOON Young-hwa go?
I know you're there!

46
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,407
Sir, that's it for today.
Thank you.

47
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,493
Why can't I say
what I have to say!

48
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,244
No one listens to me!

49
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,204
Still can't?

50
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:29,084
It won't disconnect.
He has to hang up...

51
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:33,339
Mr. YOON?
Listen carefully.

52
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,341
It's a big announcement.

53
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,343
I have a bomb.

54
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,428
I'll blow up a bridge.

55
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:45,726
I'll keep working on it.

56
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,604
I'll blow it up.
Heard me?

57
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:55,402
We don't take prank calls.
Please stop or we'll report you.

58
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,281
I gave it a lot of thought.
I have to do it.

59
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,494
Then, go ahead.

60
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:07,790
Let's see you do it!
You can't, can you?

61
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,334
I'm not lying.
I'll really blow it up.

62
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:15,256
Then, blow it up fast.
We'd like to see that.

63
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,716
Watch what you say.

64
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,345
I'm not joking.
I really have a bomb.

65
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,305
I warned you.

66
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,850
Damn bastard talks too much!

67
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,895
So, go ahead!
You son of a bitch!

68
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,734
I cut the audio.
But we can't disconnect...

69
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,986
<i>00:17 LEFT IN COMMERCIALS</i>

70
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:39,989
Just make up something?

71
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,658
That would be good.

72
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:43,867
Hold on.

73
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,661
Our show's only been a week.

74
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,580
Problems like this
come up at first.

75
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,791
It's just a slap on the wrist.

76
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,210
Just relax.
I'll handle this.

77
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,549
We apologize for the confusion
in the phone lines.

78
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:04,179
The most controversial part
is cutting transfer income tax.

79
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,599
Then, the rich pay less
and the poor pay more.

80
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,687
Thus, it is criticized
for favoring the rich.

81
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,983
YOON's Daily Topic has been
discussing this...

82
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,366
For a week,

with experts
and their opinions...

00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,342
What

85
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,434
The hell!

86
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:13,999
Hello?

87
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,127
It's me again.

- Report him to where?
- The police...

Use your head!
Listen.

Yes.

His announcement
didn't go on the air, right?

104

Right.

You're in luck.

106
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,004
- Recorded his call?
- Yes.

107
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:42,796
Save it here.

108
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,798
Don't report him?

109
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,926
He said he'll call back.
We can report him later.

110
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,511
But we should report him!

00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,263
Why you!

112
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,265
Since when were you
so law-abiding?

113
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,725
Don't you get it?

114
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:59,146
The press is on the fritz!
But we're the only ones who know!

115
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,399
How lucky is that?

116
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,653
It's our chance.

117
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,158
- We gotta cover this!
- Okay...

118
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,369
If he calls back,
we'll top the ratings!

119
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,496
Right.

120
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,413
Give it to me.

Stay put.
I'll go ask for news time.

00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,084
- I can call the newsroom.
- I got this!

123

It's a terrorist act.

What's that!

139
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,260
It blew up right after.
He did it.

140
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,427
Did it go on the air?

141
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,222
Not yet.
I called you first.

142
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,808
Okay, bring the recording
and come quick.

143
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,727

Why you!

145
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:27,609
Life is funny.

146
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,113
I got divorced, cut as anchor,
and demoted to radio.

147
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,823
My life sucked!

148
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:38,495
Maybe that all happened
for this.

149

Come up and we'll talk.

150

This is my chance
of a lifetime.

151
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,714
So come up and let's talk!

152
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,092
I don't think so.

153
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,885
What's with you?

154
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,471
You'll backstab me again
and take over.

155
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,931
Not this time.

156
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,893
What do you want?

157
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,480
To return as news anchor.

158
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,691
Fine, I'll talk to the Director.
What do you need?

159
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,735
Can you send in a camera now?

160
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,488
You take the control desk
and let's go live with this.

161
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,782
How many cameras left?

162
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,159
They all went out.

163
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,453
I'll send one.
Don't trust anyone.

164
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,706
Don't let this out.
Got it?

165
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,542
I get my anchor seat back.
We made a deal.

166
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,961
Send a camera to our radio.

167
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,796
I recorded this.
Just so you know.

168
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:42,351
An explosion at Mapo Bridge
took place at 9:35 AM.

169
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:49,983
Eye witnesses claim the bridge
collapsed in a sudden explosion.

170
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,069
Let's join our reporter
at the scene.

171
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:57,574
As you can see,
Mapo Bridge is severed.

172
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:02,537
Most of the cars made it out
before the explosion...

173
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,955
<i>LEE JI-SU</i>

174
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,999
What floor are you on?

175
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,085
I'm kind of busy.
Let's talk later.

176
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:08,669
Wait!

177
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,222
The caller is unavailable.
Please leave a message.

178
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,391
Hello?

179
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,226
Why'd you hang up?

180
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,395
Golfing with that bastard
or something?

181
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:33,068
Anyway, I'm going back
to doing news.

182
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,569
If things work out...

183
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:43,245
Maybe we can get back together?

184
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,872
I'll call you
when it's all over.

185
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,256
What did they say?

186
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,174
- He didn't call, right?
- No.

187
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,802
- Didn't report him?
- No.

188
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,595
Aren't you waiting
for him to call?

189
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,472
Why do you think
he called us?

190
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,100
To get on the air?

191
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,187
Then, we should go on the air
so he'll call.

192
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,189
So, let's prepare.

193
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,733
Prepare what?

194
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,860
To go on the air. Now.

195
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,278
Yes, sir.

196
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,498
Mapo Bridge has suddenly...

197
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,958
Ready?

198
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,793
Hold on.

199
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,879
...suddenly collapsed.

200
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,382
10 seconds left
in commercials.

201
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,685
This is YOON's Daily Topic.

202
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:55,484
As you all know, an explosion
at Mapo Bridge occurred.

203
00:12:55,484 --> 00:13:02,199
I'd like to inform our listeners
the possibility of a terrorist act.

204
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:09,414
Before the explosion, a man
claiming to be the terrorist called.

205
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,796
I believe he is now
on the line with us.

206
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,047
Hello?

207
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,596
This is YOON Young-hwa.

208
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:26,848
Yes?

209
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,146
First, let me clarify one thing.

210
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,608
Did you cause the explosion
at Mapo Bridge?

211
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,653
I told you I'll blow it up.

212
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,238
I see.

213
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,198
Please don't hang up.

214
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,077
We'll continue
after these commercials.

215
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,839
Sir? Still there?

216
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,090
Why am I not on the air?

217
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,634
You will be soon.

218
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,344
We're airing this
as a newsflash.

219
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,305
You mean,
my voice will go on TV?

220
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,892
You're quick.
Isn't that better for you?

221
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,936
Really?
How long till we start?

222
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,271
Give me 5 minutes.

223
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,524
A TV newsflash?
But that's not what we...

224
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,233
Hold on.

225
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,280
I was going to tell you.
Just stay out and come later.

226
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,406
It's okay.
You'll be back later.

227
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,367
I'm here. Don't worry.

228
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,996
Yes, sir. We'll report it.

229
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,459
Ready on standby?

230
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:38,920
What's the story?

231
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,422
Nothing yet.

232
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:44,009
We'll set up the big picture
and start from there.

233
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:44,843
Okay.

234
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,762
Chief? I'm Producer JUNG
of Daily Topic.

235
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:51,016
- You can't just come in and...
- Producer JUNG?

236
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:56,354
The CEO and Director
approved of this.

237
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,647
Our Director?

238
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,773
He didn't hear?

239
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,110
Your program's been canceled.

240
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,029
Sorry, pal.
I'll buy you drinks.

241
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,948
Get to work! Move it!

242
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,755
What?
You sent Ji-su there?

243
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,342
Worried about your ex-wife?

244
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,428
Why would she go there?

245
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:32,182
She insisted on going.
She won't listen to me.

246
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,767
Looking for trouble.

247
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,977
We can't use her footage
anyway.

248
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:39,481
Play up the human, drama code.

249
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,399
Something's up with the bastard.

250
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,526
Go with 'Who is the terrorist
and why'.

251
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:48,406
Then, he surrenders at the end.

252
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:52,077
He wanted to commit suicide,
but changed after talking to me.

253
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:58,208
Draw it out so that he's crying
and in handcuffs at the end.

254
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,250
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

255
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,669
30 seconds left.

256
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,797
Wait! This is ours.
What's the rush?

257
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,091
Give me 5 minutes
to make a call.

258
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,678
We gotta start!
Other stations have newsflashes.

259
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,762
Let's change ties.

260
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,847
Nothing on the guy yet?

261
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:17,435
So, we go live with this
and it's over!

262
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,603
Let's start. Get ready.

263
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,771
- Okay!
- Okay!

264
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,832
- Hello?
- Yes?

265
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,209
I apologize for the delay.

266
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,255
Please think through
what you want to say.

267
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,966
But what about my pay?

268
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:58,268
We can't pay a terrorist.
We don't have money.

269
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,229
With my voice on,
the ratings will skyrocket.

270
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,900
I called, got you the newsflash,
and the station takes all the money?

271
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,527
That's crazy.

272
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,156
- Where did you hear that?
- I can take this elsewhere.

273
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,240
Hold, please.

274
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,160
How much?

275
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,828
How much are you thinking?

276
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:22,917
$2,179,245.00

277
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,669
What is the money for?

278
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,381
If you want to know,
deposit it to this number.

279
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,091
It's an investment.

280
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:33,428
Because of me,
you'll get more commercials.

281
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,221
What if we can trace
your account?

282
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,349
If I get caught during the show,
it's your loss, too.

283
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:50,445
Should we wire the money?

284
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:55,658
We'll pay you.
First, let's begin.

285
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,536
If we lose the timing,
we can't pay you.

286
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,456
Sorry, that won't do.

287
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:05,543
I'll go with another station,
if you're not interested.

288
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:13,051
We have a call from a man
who claims to be the terrorist.

289
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,054
KTN news is preparing
an exclusive interview with him.

290
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,222
No deal?

291
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,187
Is this really about money?

292
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:28,191
The chance to say what you want
is what's important.

293
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,984
No one else will listen to you
like me.

294
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:35,490
But I need that money.

295
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,828
We'll pay you every penny,
plus the chance to talk.

296
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:43,289
They'll never let your voice
go on live without editing.

297
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,835
They care about the show
not you.

298
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,419
We're different.

299
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:54,217
You can swear and say anything.
I'll help you.

300
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,719
Now, it's time to start.

301
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,763
Any later and this call
will lose merit.

302
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:05,061
Okay. I got the money.
Let's begin.

303
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,482
You really paid him?

304
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,859
Just get the ratings up.

305
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,946
Then, you'll be the anchor
on tomorrow's news.

306
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:20,201
10 seconds left.

307
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,744
We're about to begin.

308
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:28,418
When I ask you a question,
just speak your mind.

309
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,086
I'll sort it out. Okay?

310
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:35,300
SNC has decided to broadcast
the phone conversation live.

311
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,554
We have an exclusive interview
with the terrorist.

312
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:40,763
Here is the exclusive.

313
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,184
This is YOON Young-hwa.

314
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:48,605
The country is at shock
over an unprecedented bombing.

315
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:54,903
SNC will broadcast live the phone
conversation with the terrorist.

316
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,447
Hello? Can you hear me?

317
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,073
Yes,I can see you.

318
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:04,120
Your identity or why you bombed
the bridge have not been revealed.

319
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,333
I think the biggest question
on our viewers' minds is this...

320
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,754
Why did you blow up
Mapo Bridge?

321
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,173
I built that bridge.

322
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:18,092
You say, you built Mapo Bridge?

323
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,970
About 30 years ago.

324
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,934
I had to provide for my family,
but didn't have any skills.

325
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:30,313
So, I just worked odd jobs
in construction.

326
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,648
I did anything for food.

327
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,607
<i>MAPO BRIDGE CONSTRUCTED IN 1983</i>

328
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:41,324
So, you worked as a worker
in constructing Mapo Bridge in 1983.

329
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:46,120
Then, two years ago they suddenly
wanted repair work clone.

330
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:54,837
They said some big-shot,
foreign guests will cross the bridge.

331
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,757
But it didn't look good
because it's too old.

332
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:01,552
Wait.
A big event 2 years ago?

333
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,220
<i>WORLD LEADERS SUMMIT</i>

334
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,890
You mean
the World Leaders Summit?

335
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,270
They said, if we worked
through the night...

336
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,941
they would pay us $25 more
to get it done fast.

337
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:22,323
When they're splashing money
saying our country's developed...

338
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:29,163
I'm still slapping on cement there
after 30 years!

339
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,165
I understand
your disappointment.

340
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:37,338
I was working on the rail
to get things clone by sunrise.

341
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,215
At the risk of my life!

342
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,591
Suddenly, the rail suddenly
gave way.

343
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,845
Please take your time.

344
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:50,226
The rail suddenly gave way...

345
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:56,232
Then, three men
Fell into the water.

346
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:05,033
I see. 3 workers fell that night
while working.

347
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,035
Then, what happened?

348
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:11,414
They were alive
and floating in the water.

349
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:19,339
But cops and rescue forces
were busy with the summit to come!

350
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:27,221
The 3 men died
while trying to make $25 more.

351
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:33,061
That's it.
No compensation or apologies.

352
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:37,273
How can they do that!

353
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,276
Is that why you blew up
Mapo Bridge?

354
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,696
To get attention
and tell this story on air?

355
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,742
I'm PARK No-kyu from Seoul.
Listen to me carefully.

356
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:53,414
Wait, sir.
Is PARK No-kyu your real name?

357
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,291
I have a name, too.

358
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,836
I also had a family,
and hoped to live well.

359
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:03,257
So, I worked like a dog
as the country ordered.

360
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:07,553
But the country thinks of us
as just clogs who died.

361
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,266
Do you understand me?

362
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:18,189
- Yes, I do. But...
- Then, call someone for me.

363
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,775
The President.

364
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,073
The President?

365
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:31,953
I just want to be treated
like a human with respect.

366
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:42,422
Tell him to officially apologize to
the 3 dead workers and family.

367
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:47,802
I fully understand
how you must feel.

368
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:52,598
But I think it'll be difficult
for the President to come here.

369
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:56,644
You said, you'd listen to
whatever I wanted!

370
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:58,896
I am listening, Mr. PARK.

371
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:02,608
However, we cannot listen to
excessive demands.

372
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,152
Is that so?

373
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:08,656
You cursed at me earlier,
can I curse, too?

374
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,159
- You can say anything, but...
- No?

375
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,785
But you swore at me.

376
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,245
Did I?

377
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:17,623
You must be mistaken.
I'll ask again.

378
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,332
The Mapo Bridge was...

379
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:21,711
Damn bastard talks too much!

380
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,505
So, go ahead!
You son of a bitch!

381
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,844
We apologize for
that interruption.

382
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:33,306
Mr. PARK No-kyu?
I'll ask you again.

383
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,351
Hello? Can you hear me?

384
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,694
Damn son of a bitch.

385
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:47,695
What now?

386
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:48,905
Why'd you curse!

387
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:49,655
Come out!

388
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:54,577
Damn it.

389
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,749
We've lost connection
with the studio.

390
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,001
Put YOON Young-hwa on.

391
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,377
I have a question.

392
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:05,087
Put him on!

393
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,549
I'm sorry,
we have a bad connection.

394
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,551
Why her?

395
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:11,385
Please calm down.

396
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:15,598
He's asking for me!
I'll finish this up!

397
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,642
- The hell...
- You're not yourself.

398
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,644
Stay out of it for now.

399
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:23,814
Backstabbing me again?
This is mine!

400
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:28,402
Are we to understand the terror
is against the government?

401
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,072
Then, can you bring the President?

402
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:33,449
You, rookie!
Don't backstab me!

403
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,450
Hand him over!

404
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,702
We already said
that's not possible.

405
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,745
Really?

406
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,164
I have a few more bombs.

407
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,249
Wait.

408
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:44,168
Are you saying
there could be more bombings?

409
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:47,755
I have the switch in hand,
but there's a problem.

410
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:48,589
What is the problem?

411
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,093
Hello?

412
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,267
Cut!

413
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:02,603
- Turn to Mapo Bridge!
- Yes, sir!

414
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:11,195
I'm reporting live from
the Mapo Bridge bombing site.

415
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,614
- Get me a wireless mic instead!
- Yes, sir.

416
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:22,290
It is the first bridge to collapse
in 19 years...

417
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,958
Chief!
Give me 1 minute!

418
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,136
What are you doing?

419
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,806
I'm warning you!
It's no good messing with the press!

420
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,766
I just want to be heard.

421
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,935
But you're saying crazy things!

422
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,688
Do you think I'm an idiot?

423
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,816
That lady got slightly hurt,
but not you.

424
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,777
Shit! What the hell?

425
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:55,489
I wouldn't keep cursing at me
if I were you.

426
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:59,493
Because there's already
a bomb on you.

427
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:01,704
What? Asshole?

428
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:17,511
If you get away from the desk,
it'll blow.

429
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,639
If you tell anyone,
it'll blow.

430
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:25,645
The entire country will see
a big hole in your head.

431
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,521
Who brought me the earpiece?

432
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,939
- Who was it?
- Get ready!

433
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,233
You're on next!

434
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,868
You planted a bomb on me?

435
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:43,537
Why're you doing this?
Do you know me?

436
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,290
Who doesn't know
YOON Young-hwa?

437
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,709
You became a reporter
for SNC in 2003.

438
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:52,380
Most trusted and influential
news anchor for 4 years.

439
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,424
The anchor of the nightly news
for over 5 years and...

440
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,177
What's that got to do
with this now?

441
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:03,224
No one will believe me,
but they trust you.

442
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:06,143
If you tell him to apologize,
I think he will.

443
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:11,941
That's what I need now.
The way you talk.

444
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:12,692
Wait.

445
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,070
That won't bring
the President here.

446
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,948
There's no time!

447
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:20,658
Wait! Hold on!

448
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:23,244
How'd the explosion happen?
Is the rookie okay?

449
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,621
Remember your closing commentary?

450
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,456
That's the news for today.

451
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,710
We'll always be just and fair
in delivering news.

452
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,754
This news has to be like that.

453
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:37,216
Then, it'll end
without any problems.

454
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,676
The hell...

455
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:40,553
You're on.
Do your job right.

456
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,888
Let's begin.
Don't test my patience.

457
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,435
Wait. Hold on a second.

458
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:48,436
I'm not ready.

459
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,019
Aren't you starting?

460
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,272
Wait! I need more time!

461
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,132
We're back on!

462
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,767
This is YOON Young-hwa.

463
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:31,979
There has been a second explosion
at Mapo Bridge.

464
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:36,233
The explosion was captured
on our camera at the scene.

465
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,820
Let's find out how our staff
is doing out there.

466
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,697
<i>LEE JI-SU IS UNHARMED</i>

467
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,659
Our reporter is...

468
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:48,662
We'll report on her status
once it comes in.

469
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,623
Bring the President.

470
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:54,335
Yes, we will try to do
the best we can.

471
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,503
I'll give you 10 minutes.

472
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:02,510
I believe it'll take more than
10 minutes from the Blue House.

473
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:06,847
He's at the National Assembly,
probably in hiding.

474
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,474
It's 3 minutes away on foot.

475
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,731
What if he cannot appear?

476
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,191
Then, they die.

477
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,485
Any rescue attempt,
and they'll all die.

478
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,863
But if he apologizes,
I'll turn myself in.

479
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,783
All I need is just an apology.

480
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,201
I see.

481
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:31,956
If the President is watching
this right now...

482
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:36,043
A terrorist has the citizens
on Mapo Bridge held captive.

483
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:40,881
There is no time to waste.
I ask for immediate action.

484
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,466
Call him directly.

485
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,802
02)730-5800

486
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,721
No!

487
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,889
Call him!

488
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:57,606
We will try calling
the Blue House.

489
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,276
What will you say!
Are you nuts!

490
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,329
Our staff is unable
to make the call.

491
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:17,126
If we don't call,
the hostages can be at risk.

492
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,878
I will call directly.

493
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:31,473
The phone is ringing.

494
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,102
<i>REALLY A CONSTRUCTION WORKER?</i>

495
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,355
Hello?
This is YOON Young-hwa.

496
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,023
Hello?

497
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:47,448
I am still waiting
for them to answer.

498
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:50,701
I'll keep trying
to reach the Blue House.

499
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:55,289
I have a question for you.

500
00:31:55,289 --> 00:32:00,419
You said, you worked as a laborer
in construction for 30 years.

501
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,378
I'll ask you again.

502
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,881
Are you really
a construction worker?

503
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:06,383
Think people who do odd jobs
are stupid?

504
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:10,971
We look dumb
and can't talk well?

505
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,932
We can think
and get mad, too.

506
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:16,143
Just didn't know how to
stand up and fight.

507
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,479
But the bombs showed me how.

508
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,980
Still no answer?

509
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,650
I am still calling.

510
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:27,446
In the meantime,
I have another question.

511
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:33,661
If what you claim is all true,
the 3 workers should be compensated.

512
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:36,956
Why do you demand
just the President's apology?

513
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:38,707
Is there another reason?

514
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:46,548
Their compensation money of
$2,179,245 was paid in full.

515
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:51,679
By You.

516
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,515
Secretary KIM Sang-mo of
Blue House National Crisis Management.

517
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:57,434
This is YOON Young-hwa of SNC.
Are you watching?

518
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,602
Yes, I am.

519
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,647
Are you aware of
the terrorist's demand?

520
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,357
Yes, I am.

521
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:04,525
There is 5 minutes left.

522
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:07,361
Where is the President?
Is he in hiding?

523
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:10,072
You got 1 minute.

524
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:13,826
For safety reasons,
I cannot disclose that.

525
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:17,413
The government is very concerned
over the terrorist acts.

526
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:20,541
So, he is not on his way?

527
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,376
With utmost priority on
our citizen's safety...

528
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:23,210
Wait.

529
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:27,423
There's no time for that.
He must come here now.

530
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,383
Is he coming?

531
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:33,262
We haven't received
notice yet.

532
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:36,890
However, we are trying our best
to stabilize the situation quickly.

533
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,396
You don't understand, Secretary KIM.
Our citizens' lives are at risk.

534
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,065
Are you insane!
Wrap it up!

535
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:57,411
If the government doesn't do
anything and casualties arise...

536
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:01,540
The citizens will not tolerate it.
I trust he is on his way.

537
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,002
Hello? Can you hear me?

538
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:08,255
Yes. We will do our best.

539
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:15,763
The boss wants my report.
Just keep it up as usual.

540
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,389
The ratings are at 50%!

541
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:27,775
That was Secretary KIM Sang-mo
of the National Crisis Management.

542
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:28,901
I repeat.

543
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:32,529
The country is engulfed
in fear by terror.

544
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:36,283
We hope for quick action
from the government.

545
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:40,829
He'd better come or else.

546
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:45,375
Yes, Mr. PARK.
I feel the same way.

547
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,711
However, there is not much
time left...

548
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,797
Don't speak, Mr. YOON!

549
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:53,675
No need to respond to
the terrorist's every word.

550
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:58,806
I'm Captain PARK Jung-min of
counter-terrorism center.

551
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:00,641
Mr. PARK?

552
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,644
Could you wait one moment?

553
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:07,481
We sent Chief CHA out
and turned everything off.

554
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:11,318
We need to buy some time.
Stay calm and follow my lead.

555
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:13,403
Ready?

556
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,988
Bring up the hostage footage.

557
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,867
Mr. PARK?
Please look at this footage.

558
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,869
Is the Mapo Bridge
footage ready?

559
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,290
Calmly report on the scene.

560
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,502
Don't excite him by using
the word 'terror' from now on.

561
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:34,174
As you can see, there are
about 10 citizens stuck on the bridge.

562
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:37,136
Mr. PARK?
This is your explosion site.

563
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,888
Do you think your cause
will be justified like this?

564
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:44,643
If I didn't blow up the bridge,
would you have talked to me?

565
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,021
Think if I talk nice,
the President will apologize?

566
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:48,856
No way.

567
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:50,899
But it's not the hostages' fault.

568
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,862
Those citizens are the same
as the 3 workers who died.

569
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:55,696
So?

570
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,906
But you will kill them?

571
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,992
No, I'll save them.

572
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:03,036
And I'll turn myself in.

573
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:07,541
Just apologize that the government
treated us wrongfully!

574
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:08,709
Then, it'll be over.

575
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,919
I know you are tensed.

576
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,338
But viewers are watching.

577
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,090
Stay calm as usual.

578
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,384
Good.
Go back to Mapo Bridge.

579
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,846
Let's turn to the situation
at Mapo Bridge.

580
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:32,649
We see a car hanging
on the edge of the bridge.

581
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:41,533
We confirmed there are
3 family members inside the car.

582
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,911
I see.

583
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:50,459
A man is bringing
two children up to the front.

584
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:54,254
He appears to be
the two children's father.

585
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,968
He appears to be
the two children's father.

586
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:05,432
The father is pushing the children
out through the sunroof.

587
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:14,608
People are actively helping
the two children out.

588
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:25,118
I pray for the family's safety
and applaud the brave helpers.

589
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:33,168
We see the two children
being safely rescued out.

590
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:42,594
Now, the father is trying
to come out after them.

591
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,856
That must've shaken him up, too.

592
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:59,069
Talk about the victim's family
to draw out sympathy.

593
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,451
Mr. PARK?

594
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:15,168
From your acts,
those two children lost their father.

595
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:20,382
You said you had a family, too.
Do you have any children?

596
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:29,850
If you just saw what happened,
you must have a change in heart.

597
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,478
The President, too.
1 minute left.

598
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:36,231
Don't look at the clock.

599
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,026
Ask him if he must get
an apology like this.

600
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:41,528
Must you do this
to get an apology?

601
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:45,824
There are legal ways
to get what you want.

602
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:49,578
Legal ways? Like what?

603
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:54,041
Use legal measures set for those
in need of help like you.

604
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,625
And judiciary measures.

605
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,211
This could be dealt with
by law.

606
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,505
Do you really believe that?

607
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:03,342
Maybe for rich, smart folks
like you.

608
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:06,928
But the law has never been
on our side.

609
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,305
I gave this a lot of thought.

610
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:12,100
But this was
the only choice I had.

611
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,893
But the victims?

612
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:15,520
What about
the innocent victims?

613
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:17,731
Please reconsider.

614
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:23,779
If you give us more time,
we'll get the apology and...

615
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:27,908
He should've already come.
It's over.

616
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:29,201
Say he'll be here
in 5 minutes.

617
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,160
Wait! Hold on!

618
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,371
<i>BLACK BULLETPROOF CAR
PULLED IN 2 MINUTES AGO!</i>

619
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,622
He's on his way.

620
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:34,498
Really?

621
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:42,339
We confirmed a black vehicle
pulling into our lot.

622
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,841
He will appear momentarily.

623
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:49,471
At last, PARK No-kyu will get
the apology he demanded.

624
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,932
Preparations to appear
are underway.

625
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:57,437
The government made
a firm decision in this matter.

626
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:01,441
He will soon arrive
at our studio.

627
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:05,487
We thank the President
for coming.

628
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:11,785
The terror will soon end
with the President's apology.

629
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,787
You've all waited long.

630
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:37,060
A guest has arrived
in our studio.

631
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:42,149
This must be
the government's best effort.

632
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:45,068
I hope Mr. PARK will see
it that way, too.

633
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:54,077
Commissioner General JOO Jin-chul
has come on behalf of the President.

634
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:58,498
So, they sent in
a fake apology, huh?

635
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:02,669
He is the police commissioner
in charge of this case.

636
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,671
I believe a more concrete
apology and...

637
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:10,427
- May I speak?
- Yes.

638
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:14,014
I'm Commissioner General
JOO Jin-chul.

639
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:22,147
The government is seeking ways
to resolve the situation reasonably.

640
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:27,486
But our priority is in seeing
there are no further casualties.

641
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:29,070
So?

642
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,530
Surrender.

643
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,200
If you disarm yourself
and turn in...

644
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,910
Get out.

645
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:39,748
We will take things into
consideration and be generous.

646
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:40,999
I said, get out!

647
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,627
5 minutes to locating him.

648
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,130
We'll find you.

649
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,510
Make the right choice
when we're giving you the chance.

650
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,845
The police won't be able
to find me.

651
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:59,809
We'll find you soon.
Then, you know what'll happen.

652
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:04,231
Looks like your head will be
on a platter not mine.

653
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:08,151
You came onto put on a show?
Or did someone send you?

654
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:12,239
Commissioner, please don't talk.
Let Mr. YOON lead.

655
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,034
Commissioner, you frankly said
to surrender.

656
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:21,748
However, such behavior
may not help the situation.

657
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,751
What if PARK No-kyu
will not surrender and...

658
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:28,588
Mr. YOON? Stay put.

659
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,757
This is between me
and the terrorist.

660
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,093
Sir! Refrain from speaking!

661
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,803
You stay put, too!

662
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:39,683
PARK No-kyu!
You think we can't catch you?

663
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:47,399
We searched through
every record on you we can find.

664
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,945
Born on August 13th, 1959.
PARK No-kyu.

665
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:54,781
This is you, isn't it?

666
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:03,832
The government does not negotiate
with terrorists. So, surrender.

667
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,585
I want an apology
not a negotiation!

668
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:12,007
Commissioner?
See the hostages on the bridge?

669
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,009
You came on
the President's behalf.

670
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:17,304
Is the government
willing to apologize?

671
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:21,641
Mr. YOON
Are you out of your mind?

672
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:27,397
How can the government bow down
to such garbage with people watching?

673
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:28,648
Wait.

674
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:31,401
Who're you calling garbage?

675
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:36,114
I worked to the bone for 30 years,
but I'm garbage?

676
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,783
What about you
who takes bribes and lies!

677
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,076
Calm down, please.

678
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:44,623
What a laugh from a guy
who was charged for bribery!

679
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:47,751
That case has been cleared.

680
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:51,046
They were all mission expenses.
And I'm innocent.

681
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,673
You think people don't know?

682
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:57,135
They're work related expenses!

683
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:03,058
Like Mr. YOON here,
everyone does it! Not just me!

684
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,017
I see.

685
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:04,893
Mr. PARK?

686
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:09,272
Please understand Commissioner JOO's
heated tone in this matter.

687
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,399
- Back to the topic...
- Look!

688
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,526
Stop being nice to him!

689
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:16,821
I said, I'm innocent!

690
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:20,075
But foul thoughts lead to
terrorist acts like this!

691
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:23,411
I can't stand him.
Tell him to get lost.

692
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,288
You know what happens,
if you don't.

693
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,414
PARK No-kyu!

694
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,416
Don't just think of yourself!

695
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,584
How can you do this!

696
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,045
Ever think
your son is watching this?

697
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:36,591
What about his young life!
You'll ruin it!

698
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:37,634
Be quiet!

699
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:39,552
Please, put that down...

700
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,304
Must you hear his voice
to give up?

701
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,306
I could release his picture,
if I want!

702
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,808
Shut up!

703
00:44:44,808 --> 00:44:47,894
He'll be marked as
a killer's son for life!

704
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,230
He's studying on a government
scholarship!

705
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,065
You should be ashamed!

706
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,233
You call yourself a father?

707
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:57,821
I cannot stand it, Mr. YOON.
Let's kill him!

708
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:59,989
After all the chance
I gave you!

709
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,492
Kill him and I'll give you
10 more minutes.

710
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:03,910
PARK No-kyu!

711
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,415
I swear, I'll catch you
and make you pay!

712
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:13,169
No! I'm killing you!
Mark my words!

713
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:13,920
What's this?

714
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:18,383
<i>BOMB IN EAR</i>

715
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,293
Mr. YOON? What's this?

716
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:56,296
What's this!
How did you know?

717
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,673
Get this off me.

718
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,091
- What?
- Get this off me.

719
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,186
Who put this on you?

720
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,396
Get this off me.

721
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,231
Get it off me now.

722
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,485
Hold on.

723
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:28,495
Chief says to go on the air,
if PARK calls back.

724
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:29,204
Everyone out!

725
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:20,964
Shit...

726
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,332
That son of a bitch.

727
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:00,837
Hello?

728
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:03,381
Hey, are you Okay?

729
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:09,804
Do the newsflash
until PARK is caught.

730
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,931
I feel like throwing up.

731
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:15,018
We'd better stop.
Get the camera away.

732
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:16,769
We are at war here!

733
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,104
See that?

734
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:21,608
Other stations are going crazy
trying to find PARK.

735
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:24,611
If you stop here,
our whole station is screwed.

736
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:26,946
How can you say that
after seeing this?

737
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:32,493
I know it's hard, but we can't stop
and let someone else have him.

738
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:36,080
You started it.
So, you finish it.

739
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,540
What!

740
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,292
After they pushed me down
to radio?

741
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:43,630
You wanna do that for life?
Make a comeback!

742
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,926
Think they'll help you?
Wake up, YOON.

743
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:51,888
They want the killer,
not a fool who threatens to kill.

744
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:53,681
To get recognized.

745
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:57,435
They probably know
where PARK No-kyu is.

746
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:02,231
They're just dragging this
with no intention to catch him.

747
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,566
What do you mean?

748
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:06,861
Think the President will come?
Never!

749
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:11,324
It looks bad if he doesn't apologize
and just catch PARK.

750
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,493
So, why wait?

751
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:16,829
The kids' father
and JOO Jin-chul dying?

752
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,206
They're too weak.

753
00:49:18,206 --> 00:49:20,875
They want footage of
PARK killing the hostages!

754
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:23,378
They gotta turn him into
the devil.

755
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:24,128
Know why?

756
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,465
So, there's no need
to apologize.

757
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:33,513
I'm part of that ending!
Shit! I'm about to die!

758
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,181
No! No! No!

759
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:40,353
PARK is just threatening you,
but you hold the key.

760
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:46,317
If you say there's no apology,
he has nothing. He'll flip!

761
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,736
He'll kill a few hostages.

762
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,698
Then, cops will get PARK.

763
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:55,451
You wrap things up
and it looks like you caught PARK.

764
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,412
It'll happen like I say.

765
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:03,209
I get it, but you're saying
we let the hostages die?

766
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:06,045
You said, this was
your chance of a lifetime!

767
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:16,431
<i>HOSTAGES MUST DIE TO END?</i>

768
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:24,313
Be honest.
You made a deal, didn't you?

769
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:29,277
I make Director,
if we hit 70% in ratings.

770
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:32,238
Why? You made
a deal with me, too.

771
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,239
It's easy.

772
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,576
If you say there's no apology,
you'll be catching PARK.

773
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,953
But still...

774
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,956
That's the only way.

775
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:47,587
If things work out,
you'll get a medal of honor.

776
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:54,761
Chief CHA Dae-eun?
Shit. This is crazy!

777
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:57,346
You weak fool.

778
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,806
I'm doing this for you...

779
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:14,781
Hello?

780
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:17,033
It's PARK Jung-min.
I'll be back soon.

781
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:19,160
Hurry up
and get this off me.

782
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,621
The dismantling team
is coming.

783
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:22,705
Did you trace the call?

784
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,500
It's taking longer than
expected.

785
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,459
How long?

786
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:30,379
- We'll handle things thoroughly...
- How long will it take!

787
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:34,217
If you reported him sooner,
we would've found him.

788
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:36,010
We promise to save you.

789
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:41,307
You're all talk.
What have you done so far?

790
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:44,435
PARK No-kyu revealed himself
from the start.

791
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:49,148
You want hell to break lose?
All he wants is an apology!

792
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,317
No, he'll never surrender.
We must catch him.

793
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:56,823
So, catching him
comes before people's lives?

794
00:51:56,823 --> 00:51:59,492
I get you don't trust cops.

795
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:02,161
Who do you think will see
you getting killed?

796
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,372
Your family, friends,
or Reporter LEE Ji-su?

797
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:06,541
The cops don't care about that.

798
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:10,753
Problem is the whole country
will be seeing it live.

799
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:14,549
We'll be totally losing
to the terrorist, if you die.

800
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:16,926
So, how will you catch him?

801
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,848
It'll take about 6 hours
to locate him.

802
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,058
How many times must I ask!

803
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,894
- So, how'll you catch him?
- Calm down.

804
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:28,688
Look.

805
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:31,482
The beginning and end
of PARK'S calls.

806
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,984
He called here twice.

807
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:35,862
We're searching through
the nation's telephone network.

808
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:39,240
We narrowed it down to
30,000 circuits for the first call.

809
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,120
We'll looking for how many circuits
overlap with the last call.

810
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,789
30,000... Shit.

811
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:50,251
But we'll find him
no matter what.

812
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:52,003
He really can't come?

813
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:54,422
The President?

814
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:00,595
Excuse me.

815
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,929
What is it?

816
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:09,103
Okay. Hold on.

817
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,273
We can nail him
with his next call.

818
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:15,193
I promise you'll get off work
on time today.

819
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:35,922
The identified victims are
a 39 year-old man...

820
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:39,759
and Commissioner General
JOO Jin-chul.

821
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:45,181
No casualties have been found
in the first and second explosions.

822
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:49,685
There were no injured victims
as well.

823
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:53,147
Let's look at the falling car
once again.

824
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,402
<i>NO CASUALTIES</i>

825
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,572
<i>HOW?</i>

826
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,458
Hello?

827
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,293
I think I know where PARK is.

828
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,086
What?

829
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,504
He's watching the bridge.

830
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:17,713
On what basis?

831
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:21,759
There were no casualties
in the first explosion.

832
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,011
That's not by chance!

833
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,805
There are traffic lights
on Mapo Bridge.

834
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:29,141
That means he blew it
when there were no cars.

835
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,643
He didn't kill people
on purpose.

836
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:31,644
But he just did

837
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:34,522
He just blew the bridge
to get attention.

838
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:37,483
If he gets the apology,
he won't blow!

839
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,860
I know I'm right!

840
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:46,075
From the 17 circuits, check near
Mapo Bridge and you'll find PARK.

841
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:46,909
Hold on.

842
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:50,663
Hey, YOON!

843
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:52,915
Just report things
as we talked about.

844
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:58,879
<i>NO APOLOGY. DECLARE ACTION
AGAINST HIM TO STOP FURTHER THREATS</i>

845
00:54:58,879 --> 00:54:59,714
Are you crazy?

846
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:02,842
If hostages don't die,
the cops won't move.

847
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:04,969
You have to read that
to catch him!

848
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:08,347
I'll send in a press van
to get interviews.

849
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:09,849
What are you doing!

850
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:12,393
Are you crazy?

851
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:14,562
Captain PARK?
Still here?

852
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:18,399
I know what you're trying to pull.
But this is my turf!

853
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:21,527
The Commissioner General died
on your watch.

854
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,196
Shouldn't you look for
a new job?

855
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,202
Hold on.

856
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,914
What if PARK kills
all the hostages?

857
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:36,375
Aren't you folks
waiting for that?

858
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,044
Answer the phone!

859
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:40,212
- Put him through.
- Hold on.

860
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,339
Do your job.

861
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,007
Read what's written.

862
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:56,270
This is YOON Young-hwa.

863
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,361
Let's continue the call.

864
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,905
Look at the bridge.

865
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:07,740
It won't last long like that.

866
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:12,161
If I get the apology,
I'll let everyone go and surrender.

867
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:13,913
Don't forget.

868
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:16,499
The hostages can't be saved.
Just read.

869
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:17,875
Ignore Chief CHA.

870
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:21,587
We sent men in
and will locate him soon.

871
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:24,256
We'll save everyone.
Just buy us some time.

872
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,974
Mr. PARK?
Please, listen carefully.

873
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:39,772
The person you asked for
is really here in our studio.

874
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:44,318
And he is ready to apologize.

875
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,656
I'll tell you the apology
in sum.

876
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:52,993
The government has decided
to accept all your demands.

877
00:56:52,993 --> 00:57:00,292
He'll apologize directly and treat you
fairly to stop any more casualties.

878
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:02,711
But there is a condition.

879
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:04,296
What's that?

880
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,174
It's simple.

881
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:13,681
They need proof that
you'll stop your terrorist acts.

882
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:18,936
You said, you'd surrender
after the apology.

883
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:23,149
I know you're nearby.
Please come to the studio.

884
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:26,944
Come and hear the apology
in person.

885
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,904
I'll give you 3 minutes.

886
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,532
If I stand in front of the camera,
it'll be all over?

887
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:36,579
That is correct.
It'll end the way you want.

888
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:40,416
How can I believe that?

889
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:44,003
What did you say to me at first?
You called because you trust me.

890
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:47,381
But how can I trust that?

891
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:51,218
Did you receive money
or something?

892
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:54,054
Pardon?

893
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:58,100
Is what they're saying
on the news all true?

894
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,936
Answer clearly.

895
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:04,356
We have a connection.
Anchor YOON Young-hwa?

896
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:06,942
You're in a tight situation.

897
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,695
We'd like to be of help.
Would it be okay?

898
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,447
Wait. Who is this?

899
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:13,365
It's Anchor LEE Sang-jin
of KTN.

900
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:21,332
We've obtained a reliable tip
on speculations about you.

901
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:28,422
We received a threatening call
from PARK to verify them with you.

902
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,424
What are you talking about?

903
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,051
May I ask a few questions?

904
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,594
No. No questions, please.

905
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:36,680
I would like this case
to be resolved quickly, too.

906
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,973
So, please don't ask.

907
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:40,226
We should resolve this.

908
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:44,855
What does that
have to do with this?

909
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,941
Are you doing this for ratings?

910
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:52,571
Here is my first question.

911
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:56,700
How long were you
the anchor of nightly news?

912
00:58:58,953 --> 00:58:59,912
Answer him.

913
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:05,376
Please answer the question.

914
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:09,547
It was for 5 years.

915
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:11,340
5 years and 2 months
to be exact.

916
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,928
Last month, you suddenly got
forced out of nightly news.

917
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:17,846
You are now on
a radio program.

918
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:22,101
That is incorrect.
I resigned on my own.

919
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,519
Let me summarize.

920
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,104
According to our source...

921
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:31,569
during your 57 months
as the nightly news anchor...

922
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:35,447
You received contributions.
Correct?

923
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:36,949
What source?

924
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:39,618
Please just answer,
'yes' or 'no'.

925
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:43,289
Let me ask a question.

926
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:45,040
Who gave you the file
you're looking at?

927
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,127
We cannot disclose that.

928
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:48,961
It was me.

929
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:56,635
If you say what we want,
I'll cover for you.

930
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,972
If PARK doesn't get caught,
you will!

931
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:10,649
Mr. PARK?

932
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:14,778
The hostages on the bridge
are in great danger.

933
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:18,032
There is no time.
Let's focus on the issue at hand.

934
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:22,161
So, you admit you took bribes?

935
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:23,245
Continue.

936
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:24,622
Let's continue.

937
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:31,754
You won the journalist of the year
award last October.

938
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:35,132
But the exclusive report
you won with...

939
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:40,929
was revealed to be that of
your wife at the time, LEE Ji-su.

940
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:47,019
There's no need to listen to
such groundless speculations.

941
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:50,606
Shit! Cut the dirty crap!

942
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:52,566
I'll clear things up
with Ji-su.

943
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,818
I'll tell her I ordered you
to steal her story.

944
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:04,203
If you want to make it big,
you gotta do dirty shit like me.

945
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:11,043
That's life.
If I were you, I'd read that.

946
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:16,298
We'll give you the chance
to explain.

947
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:21,011
Please answer the question.

948
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,475
<i>PRESIDENT'S ON HIS WAY!</i>

949
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,646
Hold on.

950
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:35,275
Excuse me.

951
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:43,742
<i>HE'S IN NEXT STUDIO. TOP SECRET.
STALL UNTIL HE MUST APPEAR.</i>

952
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,416
I apologize.
I'll answer.

953
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,543
Anchor LEE Sang-jin?

954
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:59,133
Stating false rumors as the truth
for ratings is deceiving the viewers.

955
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:01,343
Think the viewers are stupid?

956
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:04,263
I'll answer clearly, again.
That is not the truth!

957
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:09,810
You claim they are all lies.

958
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,770
Then, let me ask you.

959
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:16,358
Why didn't you report things
when Mapo Bridge first exploded?

960
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:25,117
Producer JUNG Yong-suk of
'Daily Topic' informed us, directly.

961
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:27,494
Well...

962
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:32,207
It seems to me...

963
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:39,339
an ex-anchor who took bribes
and stole his wife's report...

964
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:45,345
did not report the terrorist
to get an exclusive.

965
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,723
Any comments on that?

966
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:54,521
Well...

967
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:59,902
The ratings just hit 78%.

968
01:02:59,902 --> 01:03:02,905
Let's have drinks some time.

969
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:04,782
Forget the news anchor deal.

970
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:21,715
Mr. YOON?

971
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:26,970
We will assume
you gave us your answer.

972
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,349
We just complied to
the terrorist's demand.

973
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:34,686
KTN has nothing to do with this.

974
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:37,773
There is a bomb inside
YOON Young-hwa's ear.

975
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:38,398
Wait!

976
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:39,316
Mr. PARK! Wait!

977
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:43,695
I wouldn't have clone this,
if men like him did the news right.

978
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:44,655
That's all the news.

979
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:48,450
Wait! I'll get you the apology!
I swear!

980
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,203
You? You have no right!

981
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:53,288
He's right in the next room.

982
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,042
Look.

983
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:01,380
It is hard to see
from my phone...

984
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,550
But the police texted me.
He is in the next room.

985
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,677
So, he will apologize now?

986
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:08,387
Yes. Right now.

987
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:11,223
He'll apologize shortly.

988
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:17,688
<i>LEE JI-SU ON STANDBY
AT MAPO BRIDGE</i>

989
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:21,692
What the hell is going on!

990
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:25,946
Chief CHA told us not to tell.
She's there.

991
01:04:26,572 --> 01:04:28,115
<i>BRIDGE PART ABOUT TO SINK</i>

992
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:32,411
Mr. PARK?

993
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:35,873
The hostages on Mapo Bridge
are in grave danger.

994
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:38,041
Our reporter is out
on the scene.

995
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:42,588
Let's find out
what's happening.

996
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:44,214
Reporter LEE Ji-su?

997
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:47,384
Yes. I'm at Mapo Bridge.

998
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:52,764
Can you tell us
what is happening?

999
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:57,311
Our camera was damaged
in the second explosion.

1000
01:04:57,311 --> 01:05:00,606
I'm reporting
with my cellular phone.

1001
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:04,818
I apologize for
the poor footage.

1002
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:11,700
Currently, there are 16 civilians
trapped on top of Mapo Bridge.

1003
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:17,831
Having watched the newsflash,
the citizens are trembling in fear.

1004
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,625
Some are suffering from burns...

1005
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:30,761
People with severe burns
are in urgent need of treatment.

1006
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:33,221
Reporter LEE Ji-su.

1007
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:37,142
Are you okay?

1008
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:46,026
The bridge plate we are on
is tilted 15° due to the explosion.

1009
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,239
It appears to be so
on screen.

1010
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:56,411
The slant is getting worse
with time.

1011
01:05:56,411 --> 01:06:02,209
There is no telling
how long we will last.

1012
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:06,296
There are rescue helicopters
flying overhead.

1013
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:11,134
But no rescue can be made
without the terrorist's consent.

1014
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:14,054
I see.

1015
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:16,515
Reporter LEE Ji-su?

1016
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:18,141
Yes?

1017
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:24,189
Nothing...

1018
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:28,568
Please stay still and safe
until this ordeal is over.

1019
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:31,279
It'll be fine.

1020
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:35,325
I hope you will finish
the news safely, too.

1021
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,162
Thank you.

1022
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,872
Mr. PARK?

1023
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:44,167
The hostages on the bridge
are in great danger.

1024
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:47,963
- Please let women and children...
- Don't change the subject!

1025
01:06:47,963 --> 01:06:50,382
No apology, they all die.

1026
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:54,803
As I mentioned,
the President will apologize.

1027
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:57,222
But if the civilians die,

1028
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,558
it will be over!
No apology!

1029
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:01,810
They have nothing
to do with this!

1030
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:03,854
Not really.

1031
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:06,898
Isn't the lady reporter
important to you?

1032
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,819
We've located him!

1033
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,739
Like you said,
he was watching the bridge.

1034
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:14,740
Our men are headed there...

1035
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:16,950
Wait! Then, he's not coming?

1036
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,368
- Arresting PARK comes first.
- But the hostages?

1037
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,745
Give us 5 more minutes.

1038
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:23,749
Enough with more minutes!
You said, he was coming!

1039
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:27,210
An apology doesn't guarantee
the hostages' safety.

1040
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,211
YOON Young-hwa!

1041
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:31,673
Yes, I'm talking with
the police.

1042
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:33,091
He'll be here soon.

1043
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:36,386
Why can't he come
and apologize?

1044
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,513
You said he'd come!
Damn it!

1045
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,941
Mr. PARK?
What are you doing?

1046
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,359
Clear the helicopters!

1047
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,070
Think you can play games?

1048
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,198
I'll bring him.

1049
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,825
Still not coming?

1050
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,285
Are you watching?

1051
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:02,579
You hear me well, don't you?

1052
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:05,624
You're killing those people!

1053
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:06,500
Watch carefully.

1054
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,293
Wait! Mr. PARK! Please!

1055
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:16,676
The President must still
be getting ready to appear.

1056
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:21,139
We are all in this difficult situation
along with you.

1057
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:22,599
Shut up and close your eyes.

1058
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,603
Where'd the cop go?

1059
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,772
She said she'd bring him!
Go check! Hurry!

1060
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:30,774
The entire country is watching.

1061
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:32,400
Mr. PARK.

1062
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:39,116
Appealing to the public
can get you the apology.

1063
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:43,912
For that, you must release
some hostages.

1064
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:48,792
I'll stay.
But I beg you to let the women

1065
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:52,504
and children be rescued.

1066
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:02,472
Fine.

1067
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:05,183
Women and children only.
Hurry!

1068
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:09,980
PARK No-kyu agreed to release
some of the hostages.

1069
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:15,652
Now, it's the government's turn
to show action in response.

1070
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:19,072
I ask the President
in the next studio.

1071
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,699
There is no time.

1072
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:23,034
Please come at once
and apologize.

1073
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:27,247
I repeat.
PARK released some hostages.

1074
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:32,377
As you can see, a helicopter
is approaching for the rescue.

1075
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,039
Just now...

1076
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:24,429
I ask all rescue forces
on the water...

1077
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:29,893
Please promptly start searching
at the crash site.

1078
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:30,769
Please...

1079
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:35,899
There must be survivors.

1080
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:38,318
I trust everyone can be rescued.

1081
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,569
Please hurry.

1082
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:44,950
Once again, I ask all rescue forces
to start searching for survivors.

1083
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:56,127
Mr. PARK?

1084
01:10:57,671 --> 01:10:59,214
What do you say to this?

1085
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:08,556
Cut the sh...stuff about apologies
and say something.

1086
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,142
I'm sorry.

1087
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:18,942
You were going to kill them
anyway!

1088
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,486
Son of a...

1089
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:26,533
You're sorry?
How can you say that!

1090
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:33,373
I started this
just to hear those two words.

1091
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:35,917
I said to come quick
because it'll collapse.

1092
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:42,090
I agreed to the rescue!
But where is he?

1093
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:48,680
It's out of my hands now.

1094
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:49,532
I'm watching you.
Can you hear me?

1095
01:12:52,494 --> 01:12:55,747
I'm at the scene.
We're going to catch PARK.

1096
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:57,415
Good work.

1097
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:04,089
If I hear anything on LEE Ji-su,
I'll let you know. Don't hang up.

1098
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:06,591
It's all over now.

1099
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:22,440
<i>HOSTAGES MUST DIE TO END?</i>

1100
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:26,611
<i>POLICE LOCATED TERRORIST</i>

1101
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,864
The terrorist is
about to be shot down.

1102
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:33,952
There is no threat of
additional bombings.

1103
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:34,911
YOON Young-hwa?

1104
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:38,706
It's not over for us.

1105
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:42,794
Cameras are here to film me
getting caught.

1106
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:48,049
But I have
another announcement.

1107
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:54,931
I'm going to blow up
this building.

1108
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:56,433
Wait! Hold on!

1109
01:13:58,518 --> 01:13:59,769
I inform the police!

1110
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,646
Stop your arrest!

1111
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,106
There is another bomb.

1112
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:05,233
Stop the arrest!

1113
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:05,817
Hello?

1114
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:06,651
Can you hear me?

1115
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:09,654

Hello?

1125
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:05,747
It's Secretary KIM Sang-mo.
Are you alright?

Yes, I'm fine.

No.

1131

No, I didn't.

There's no time,

Then, what's the problem?

01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:54,962
The public will protest and say
it was excessive use of force.

1151
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:26,619
Still, you took the money.

You gave it to me! Damn it!

You're a lot dumber
than you look.

1154

Why didn't you just do
what Chief CHA told you to?

1155
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,925
Saying on TV to apologize
and shit. The nerve!

1156
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:46,639
I recorded everything.
I'll spill it everywhere!

YOON Young-hwa can

01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:06,951
Or go on the run.

1161

Thus, he'll soon be detained

But no leads
have yet been found.

You're smart.
So, I'll ask one question.

1165

If I get caught,
how long will I have?

1166
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:50,369
I'll be executed.

1167

one of the workers who died during

The police claim the terrorist
is skilled in engineering.

1211
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:12,465
The investigation
could take weeks.

The two buildings look like
they could collapse any minute.

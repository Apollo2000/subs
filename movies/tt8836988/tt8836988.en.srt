3
00:01:09,323 --> 00:01:11,156
Let's have
the back now, Carter.

4
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:12,159
Copy that.

5
00:01:56,136 --> 00:01:58,036
Gentlemen, good morning.

6
00:01:58,038 --> 00:02:01,039
I'm so sorry, but I'm afraid
you've had a wasted trip.

7
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,375
Mrs. Burgess
passed away this morning.

8
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:06,344
Oh. Understood.

9
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:09,214
Oh, well. My sincere
condolences, Mr. Burgess.

10
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:10,849
But I'm afraid it's back
to the nick with you.

11
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:12,784
I'd like to see her,
if it's all the same.

12
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:15,256
What's the point?
She's dead.

13
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:19,393
I'd like to see my mother.

14
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:58,923
Hold on, mate.
Members only.

15
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:03,330
- Yeah, I'm a member.
- We're closed. Fuck off.

16
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,645
Enjoy.

17
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:21,315
Cheers, mate.

18
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:32,525
You look like a man who could
do some wishful drinking.

19
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:33,958
What can I get
for you, my love?

20
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,461
Oh, I dunno.

21
00:04:35,463 --> 00:04:37,330
What you got on tap
that's decent?

22
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:40,131
It's a members' club,
not the fucking Ritz, darling.

23
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:43,335
- Just what you see.
- All right, I'll have anything with a hefty head then, please.

24
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:49,344
Yeah, I think I can do that. Been behind
this bar since you were in short trousers.

25
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:57,416
- Not seen you in here before.
- I don't get out much.

26
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:00,152
Oh, I bet you're the life
and soul of the party, are ya?

27
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:02,688
Do you know what?
I do have my moments.

28
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,123
Keep the change.

29
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,326
Cheers.

30
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:10,429
Everyone's spooked.
Everyone.

31
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:13,666
Even Hyde's moved
his office upstairs.

32
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:17,268
And Lincoln said he don't want no one out on
the streets till this has been cleared up.

33
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,104
We're on curfew 'cause Rook
couldn't handle his shit

34
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:21,307
against some nutter
with a blade?

35
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:23,942
It was a fuckin' axe.
And no.

36
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:27,012
We're on a curfew 'cause,
one, Stokes is gone missing,

37
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:31,216
and two,
that nutter killed Rook.

38
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:34,085
Well, we all feel bad for him, bro.
But I've got a business to run.

39
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:36,555
Rook would be the first
to agree with me,

40
00:05:36,557 --> 00:05:39,190
because whilst he was
a bit of sadistic cunt,

41
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:41,627
he was first
and foremost a professional.

42
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:45,698
Did you hear
what happened to him?

43
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,502
You do you know
about the hand, don't ya?

44
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:52,170
- What hand?
- For fuck's sake.

45
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:54,205
Oi, Tune.

46
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:56,509
Come and tell Vern here
what happened to you and Rook.

47
00:05:56,511 --> 00:06:00,479
- Why? What do you wanna know?
- Just tell him what happened!

48
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:05,316
See, me and Rook, you know,
we're standin' on the corner.

49
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:07,018
And we're slingin'
a bit of Scooby.

50
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,587
You know,
standard Tuesday night.

51
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:10,623
And all of a sudden,
we clock this geezer.

52
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,025
You know, standing on
the other side of the road.

53
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:15,193
And he's eye-fuckin' us.
Yeah.

54
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:17,430
So Rook turns around, he says he's
gonna go and have a quick word.

55
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:20,399
Now, I can't do nothin' about it.
I've got customers to deal with.

56
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:25,137
Next thing, Rook is on his hands
and knees, holdin' his arm.

57
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,141
I realize he's had his fucking
hand cut off by this nutter.

58
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,079
Yeah? So obviously I goes fucking
running over, ready to smash his face in,

59
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:35,681
and this guy shits himself
and runs.

60
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:37,516
Obviously, I give chase,

61
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:39,083
but this guy's fast, right?

62
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:41,219
He's, I mean, crackhead fast.

63
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:43,789
So I realize I've left Rook in
the middle of the fuckin' street.

64
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:48,027
But by the time I get back,
he's fuckin' dead.

65
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:50,463
There's blood everywhere. I
couldn't find his fuckin' hand.

66
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:57,102
Like, just gone. Vanished.

67
00:06:57,104 --> 00:06:59,104
Yeah, what's with the laugh,
mate?

68
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:01,507
Don't mind me, pal.
Don't mind me.

69
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:04,175
Who's this prick?

70
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:09,548
You must
be a tough guy then, yeah?

71
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,218
Chasin' that bloke away
all by yourself.

72
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,554
It's funny, that. You don't
look like a tough guy to me.

73
00:07:14,556 --> 00:07:16,120
Well, what's a fucking tough guy
look like then?!

74
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:17,656
Well,
they look like me, don't they?

75
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,125
You know, handsome, well-aged.

76
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,762
Yo, Bez!
Who the fuckin' hell's this?

77
00:07:22,764 --> 00:07:25,699
I dunno. He didn't say his name.
Cliff let him in.

78
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:27,165
I thought he was part
of the firm.

79
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,601
I'm an old friend of Lincoln's.

80
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:30,703
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, that's right, mate.

81
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:33,239
How'd you
fuck up your face so bad?

82
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:34,607
Playing with your dildo, was it?

83
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:36,208
Yeah,
borrowed it off your dad, mate.

84
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,478
Well, he's got some
fucking front, don't he?

85
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,448
Not as much as you, judging by that
fuckin' yarn you were just spinnin'.

86
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,216
Cor, he's doin' you
right out there, Tune.

87
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:45,651
You weren't fuckin' there,
right?!

88
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:48,153
- Just shut up!
- Oi! Simmer down, yeah?

89
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:49,523
Don't make me
call last orders early.

90
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,390
And you,
stop winding him up.

91
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:52,858
Or you can get the fuck out!

92
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,727
All right, all right.
I'll apologize.

93
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,495
Lads, lads,
I'm sorry, all right?

94
00:07:56,497 --> 00:07:59,098
I'm just havin' a laugh with ya,
yeah? A bit of a giggle.

95
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,668
I'll finish my beer
and be on my way.

96
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,771
Yeah, right along...
dickhead.

97
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:08,340
- Enough.
- What the fuck?!

98
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:10,109
What do you know about
Frankenstein's monster over there?

99
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,510
I never seen
the freak before in my life.

100
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:13,446
And I think
I'd fucking remember.

101
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:15,848
Hasn't exactly got a face you
can fucking forget, is it?

102
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,450
- He seems to have you sussed.
- What's your fucking problem?

103
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:22,756
No, no, no, he's right.
If Lincoln invited him,

104
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:26,258
we best just keep things civil.

105
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,628
- So, go on.
- Go on what?

106
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,165
- Finish the fucking story.
- Yeah, right. 'Course.

107
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:36,670
So, I'm... I'm obviously standin' there.
This big, massive bag of merch.

108
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:39,371
You know, Rook's lyin' in the street, dead.
Next thing, I hear

109
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:41,740
the sirens comin', the police are
on the way. So I had to fuck off.

110
00:08:41,742 --> 00:08:43,509
- Do you know what I mean?
- Bollocks!

111
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:45,377
You were long gone
way before they arrived.

112
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:47,914
- What?!
- Ran off shitting bricks, you did.

113
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:51,417
- Do you want me cave your fucking face opened up again?
- Oh, here we go!

114
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:54,219
Finally found your ball,
did ya, mate? Yeah?

115
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:57,456
Don't you think it's about time
you told your mates the truth?

116
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,292
Tune,
what's he goin' on about?

117
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:03,829
Yeah, Tune,
what am I goin' on about?

118
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:06,632
I dunno. His head's fucked, Mo!
I dunno, he's fuckin' twisted.

119
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:09,401
Well, you wanna hear my
twisted take on this tale?

120
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:12,839
- Not really, chap.
- Well, fucking humor me!

121
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:15,543
At least whilst
I finish my pint.

122
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:18,677
'Cause there was a bloke
standing staring at you.

123
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,379
That much is true.

124
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:22,749
Yeah, Rook.
Check out Bill.

125
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:25,719
He's been eye-fuckin' us
for the past ten minutes.

126
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:29,323
Yo, bruv!
Can we help you with somethin'?

127
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,564
Mate, you deaf?!

128
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:40,368
I'm fuckin' talkin' to you,
mate. What do you want?

129
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:44,904
- Sorry, mate, but...
- Am I supposed to be scared?

130
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:47,206
- Here, go ahead.
- Huh?

131
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,309
Makes a change,
you fuckin' paying.

132
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,646
It's good. Fuck off.

133
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:56,281
Look,
just fuck off, yeah? Ah!

134
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:04,623
Fuckin' hell!

135
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,393
Nah, that's bollocks. You know
I'd never run from a fight.

136
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:10,295
- Just this once then, eh, Tuney?
- Oh, fuck off, you wanker!

137
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:12,799
- So you killed Rook?
- Yeah, that's right, mate.

138
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:15,701
What the fuck
are you gonna do about it?

139
00:10:15,703 --> 00:10:18,905
Well, clearly you're only
interested in one thing.

140
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:21,474
Oi.
It's time for you to leave.

141
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:23,309
I've still
got half a pint left, love.

142
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:27,413
Yeah, my pub, my pints.
Get out!

143
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:30,282
Come here, you fuckin' wanker!

144
00:10:35,023 --> 00:10:40,325
Get the fuck back!
Oi, get over there! Move it!

145
00:10:40,327 --> 00:10:43,395
Anyone else make a move on me,
I'll kill 'em!

146
00:10:43,397 --> 00:10:46,768
Swear to fucking Christ!
Get away from that door!

147
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:52,839
Where is he?

148
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:54,674
- Where the fuck is he?!
- Who?!

149
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:57,444
- Lincoln!
- How is this low-key,

150
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,815
you stupid, noisy...

151
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:05,386
Come here! Turn around!

152
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:08,855
Get over there.

153
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:11,326
You got anyone else up there?!

154
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:18,734
You remind me
of someone.

155
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:23,403
- All right.
- But you can't be him,

156
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:27,306
'cause he's on a long stretch,
and he was a little melt.

157
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:31,044
Fuck me.

158
00:11:31,046 --> 00:11:33,413
The prodigal brother returns.

159
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:35,815
What rock did you
crawl out from under?

160
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:39,085
HMP Belmarsh,
like you didn't know.

161
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:44,457
- Who the fuck is this joker?
- Well, ladies. This is Cain Burgess.

162
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:47,527
Lincoln's little baby brother.

163
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,964
Are you jokin'?
What, this nutter?!

164
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:52,799
Did a job for us few years ago.
Cocked it up.

165
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:56,703
- Went down for five years.
- Seven years now.

166
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:58,571
Is that where
they redecorated your face?

167
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:01,674
Fuck me. Looks like someone
set fire to your head

168
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:04,543
and put it out with a shovel.
Still, not all bad, eh?

169
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:07,680
Must have liked all that cock.

170
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:17,891
All right! Looks like
we're havin' a lock-in, Bez!

171
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:20,059
So do me a favor.

172
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:24,131
Rustle me up another one
of your perfectly-poured pints.

173
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:28,034
- Please.
- That's better. Only takes a moment to be courteous.

174
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:30,003
Ya little cunt.

175
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:32,071
- Mind your language, Beryl.
- Beryl?

176
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:35,475
Do I look like I was born
in the '20s, ya cheeky git?

177
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:37,077
- It's Bez.
- Yeah, all right. Bez then.

178
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,411
Could be short for Beryl,
couldn't it?

179
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:41,581
I used to blush as a kid.
Got called Strawberry,

180
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:45,385
and then it got trimmed down to Berry.
Ended up as Bez.

181
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:49,089
- I don't blush now, darlin'.
- Yeah, I bet you don't.

182
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:51,057
- Ahh!
- Get back!

183
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:53,927
Get back! I fuckin' told you
what would happen, didn't I?

184
00:12:56,832 --> 00:13:00,400
Oh, fuck!

185
00:13:00,402 --> 00:13:01,536
All right!

186
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:07,040
You've done my leg!

187
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:10,476
Mobile phones!
One from each of ya.

188
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:13,479
Throw them in there, or the person next to you

189
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:16,916
gets fuckin' kneecapped.
Do it! Come on!

190
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:22,189
Can't fucking hear myself think!
Shut up!

191
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:25,491
Well, to be fair, you have just blown
his foot off. It will sting a bit.

192
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,870
That's nice.
Nice and quiet.

193
00:13:35,872 --> 00:13:39,739
Hyde, this cunt
reckons he killed Rook.

194
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:43,543
Really?
Well, Tune, you chased 'im off.

195
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:47,647
- You recognize him?
- No. He's full of shit, Hyde.

196
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:50,084
- What do you say to that, Cain?
- You think I'm full of shit, do you?

197
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:51,484
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

198
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:54,721
You're full of shit, apparently.

199
00:13:54,723 --> 00:14:01,429
Your mate Rook had a chunky chess
piece inked on his hand, yeah?

200
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,903
- Open it.
- Fuck that.

201
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:11,805
- I said open it!
- I'll do it.

202
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:14,208
No! No. He needs to do it.

203
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,876
Open it, you fuckin' pigmy!
Go on.

204
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:19,581
- Do it.
- All right.

205
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:24,620
That's it.

206
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:34,995
Jesus fucking Christ!
You're fucking mad, mate!

207
00:14:34,997 --> 00:14:37,164
- Oh, dear, Cain.
- Well, I guess that clears up

208
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,800
- the whole "How full of shit am I?" debate.
- What have you done?

209
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:44,173
So how about we have a nice little
breather? Why don't you gents take a seat?

210
00:14:45,607 --> 00:14:47,942
Come on, sit down!

211
00:14:47,944 --> 00:14:51,210
Fucking sit down, mate. You eyeball
me, I'll blow your fuckin' head off.

212
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:53,613
Sit down.

213
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:55,748
All right, Bez,
drinks all 'round.

214
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,719
You can put 'em on Hyde's tab.

215
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:01,188
- He ain't got a tab, love.
- Hm.

216
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,156
I dunno whether you've been
payin' attention or not.

217
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:04,757
I've got a big fuckin' gun
in my hand,

218
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,927
and I'm not afraid to use it.

219
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:09,663
Hate to piss on your chips, darlin',
but this ain't the first time

220
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:12,733
I've looked
into that end of a shooter.

221
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:18,005
Be reasonable, Bez. Do us all
a round of drinks. Please.

222
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:20,274
Yeah, Bez,
will you get us one of them

223
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:21,976
Rooster Rojos as well, please?

224
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:23,110
You'll get what
you're fucking given. All right?

225
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:24,878
Yeah, 'course. Yeah.

226
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,717
Now, I'll have a Rooster Rojo.

227
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:33,222
So...

228
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:38,691
...prison turned you into
a stone-cold killer, did it?

229
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:43,199
Nah, prison didn't.
You and my brother did.

230
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:49,272
You wanna know what I think?

231
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:53,976
Fuckin' sit down! Fuck off!

232
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:08,756
I'm gonna take pleasure...
crackin' your fuckin' skull open.

233
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:11,625
But you know what?
That can wait.

234
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:14,295
And I got pretty
good at waitin'.

235
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:16,964
Get your phone out.

236
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,233
You're gonna tell 'im
to get down here, right now.

237
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:22,770
You're gonna tell 'im it's about
Rook, and then you're gonna hang up.

238
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:30,144
Yeah, it's me. Need you
to come down to the Jockey.

239
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:34,283
We got a situation.
It's about Rook.

240
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:40,854
Good boy.

241
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:44,925
Hyde. Please tell me it
was you and all the lads

242
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:48,265
- that gave that cunt all his scars.
- Oh, I'm sorry, mate.

243
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:51,697
But I wish it was.

244
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:54,001
Oh, you wanna know how
I got these scars, do ya?

245
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:56,170
Oh, yeah. Enlighten us.

246
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:58,906
You and my brother
may as well have carved

247
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:02,210
each one of these scars
into my flesh.

248
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:05,045
Where have you been hiding yourself these days, Cain?

249
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:07,915
- We haven't seen you in ages.
- I thought I better not show my face

250
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:09,349
around for a bit,
you know how I mean?

251
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:11,051
Need to talk to my brother,
though.

252
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:12,153
Got a great business deal
for 'im.

253
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,322
You hear that?

254
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,091
Perhaps you should give the lad a shot.
He's on the up-and-up.

255
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:20,928
Doesn't know the meaning of dishonesty.
Couldn't even throw a fight.

256
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,031
The up-and-up?
The fuck-up, more like.

257
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:28,035
All you had to do
was lose a fight.

258
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:30,204
- Lost me a packet.
- Do you know what, Rook?

259
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:32,039
I don't think I heard
what you just called me.

260
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,807
Do you, uh, do you wanna say
that again, mate?

261
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,244
- You heard.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

262
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:38,778
You lost a packet,
you dumped five large.

263
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,283
I dumped 15 large.

264
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:44,751
What is it you wanted from me?

265
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:46,287
Is it all right if I have a word
with you outside?

266
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:49,324
You mad? I'm in the middle
of a card game.

267
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:53,227
You got something' you wanna
ask me, let's hear it.

268
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:56,399
All right.

269
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:01,369
I've got
a business proposition for ya.

270
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,371
It's, uh, it's a good deal. Been
talkin' it through with Mum,

271
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:06,440
- and she thinks it could be a real winner.
- Mum?

272
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:08,976
- Yeah.
- Well, you know I love our mum.

273
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:12,115
Means more to me
than life itself.

274
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:16,750
But since when
has her business acumen

275
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:19,487
got anything to do
with what I fuckin' do?

276
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,256
Well, you remember Sulley
from the gym, right?

277
00:18:21,258 --> 00:18:24,159
Yeah, Old Sulley,
he's jackin' it in.

278
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:26,261
So I made him an offer,
he's accepted. Right?

279
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:29,363
It's a good deal, real good deal.
Just need the start-up capital.

280
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:31,899
Which is where you come in, of
course, but I've got a business plan

281
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:34,302
- written up and everything.
- Should be a laugh.

282
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:36,437
Let's hear it.

283
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:41,909
Cain, I have a few very simple
rules that I live my life by.

284
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,279
And they've served me
double well over the years.

285
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:46,914
One of 'em is never, ever,
ever lend money to family.

286
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,516
It's a good plan now, right?
I'm tellin' ya,

287
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,751
I could go through it with you
right now if you want.

288
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:56,023
No. Because
I'm gonna pass, mate.

289
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:58,960
You see, little bruv,
lending money is what I do.

290
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:01,496
- I know.
- I mean, what happens if you can't pay me back,

291
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:05,065
and your business plan
goes fucking backside?

292
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:07,335
We don't wanna come after you
and seriously hurt you.

293
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:10,939
- Oh, come off it, mate.
- Gyms come and go, mate.

294
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,374
What makes yours so fuckin' special?
Not your star-studded career.

295
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:17,878
Please don't tell me that,
because you fucked up.

296
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,917
You fucked up. Every one of your fans
in this room dumped proper money on you.

297
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,352
- I know.
- Because they trusted you.

298
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:26,154
- Yeah.
- And now you're coming to me,

299
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:28,891
and you're askin' me
to fund your next gamble.

300
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,328
Why do you talk to me like that?
Eh? Condescending.

301
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,030
- You're my brother, not my fuckin' dad.
- I know, but you're comin' to me

302
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:37,832
and you're askin' for money.
What do you expect?

303
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,334
- Fuck this.
- Cain, Cain, Cain.

304
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:44,372
Come on, sit down. Sit down.

305
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:47,844
You always fuckin' get excited.
You and that temper.

306
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:51,111
Look, I know
what you're tryin' to do.

307
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:53,080
You're keepin' your nut down

308
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:54,549
and you're fuckin' keepin' your
nose clean. That's a good thing.

309
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:57,885
It's a really good thing,
and I'm proud of ya.

310
00:19:57,887 --> 00:19:59,854
But I'm tellin' you now,
if you want me to break

311
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:03,123
one of my rules
and lend you money...

312
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,427
then you're gonna
have to do something for me.

313
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:08,829
I appreciate that, but I'm not lookin'
to get into anything like that.

314
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,298
I don't want
to do anything illegal.

315
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,100
This is the closest
you're ever gonna get

316
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:14,168
to me lendin' you money.

317
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,406
So take it or leave it.

318
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:21,976
- Well, what's the job?
- Go and see Hyde.

319
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:24,212
He'll fill you in everything
you need to know.

320
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:27,314
And trust me,
it's a piece of piss.

321
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:29,552
Not even you could fuck it up.

322
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,023
Can we have a salesman
on the floor, please?

323
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,859
We have a customer
interested in the Jaguar.

324
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,861
I bet seven grand
on you losin' that fight.

325
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:43,965
I was tryin' to make it
look real, wasn't I?

326
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:46,501
So you knocked him out cold?

327
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:49,203
In Mexico, you know what happens
to people that behave like that?

328
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:53,341
They string him up under a bridge, cut off
their dick, and shove it down their mouths.

329
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:55,276
- Come on, it's a bit harsh, isn't it?
- Yeah, well, you know,

330
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:58,112
they're savages.
But that's not the point.

331
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:01,416
It hurt,
and I don't just mean the money.

332
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:04,117
- We're friends.
- Yeah, I know.

333
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,454
Your brother tells me,
"Oh, give him another shot."

334
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:08,523
But... I'm not so sure.

335
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:12,494
Look, I made a mistake. Right?
It's not gonna happen again.

336
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:14,928
Because my brother
is gonna vouch for me.

337
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,664
Rook says you're
a fucking liability.

338
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,599
Oh, well, if Rook says so,
I'll just fuck off then.

339
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:21,369
Oh, sit down, princess.
Don't shit yourself.

340
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:24,372
I didn't say
we weren't gonna use you.

341
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:30,447
I'm just lettin' you know your
standing in terms of the establishment.

342
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:36,951
- You seen one of these before?
- Blue plastic bag?

343
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:39,387
- Seen a few, yeah.
- Oh, man of the world, are we?

344
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:43,691
At 3:00 this afternoon,
Mabel Liddell

345
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:47,095
is gonna come into this office.

346
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,467
She's gonna
take this away with her.

347
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:54,268
You are gonna follow her home

348
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,205
to London Fields,
where she lives.

349
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,173
You're gonna take
that bag off of her,

350
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:02,610
and you're gonna
bring it back here.

351
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:07,515
- Simple.
- What's in the bag?

352
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:10,552
About, um...
about two and half pounds

353
00:22:10,554 --> 00:22:12,454
of none
of your fucking business.

354
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,256
If she causes you any trouble,

355
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:18,159
you can knock her out cold,
can't you?

356
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:20,962
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah. All right then, laughing boy.

357
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,065
Wipe the fucking smile off your
face, have a dump, wind your watch,

358
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:28,102
fuck off across the street, get outta my
office, and close the door on your way out.

359
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:35,477
Well, this is all very interesting,
but is it goin' anywhere?

360
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,413
Yeah, it is, actually.

361
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:39,547
You see,
because of you and my brother,

362
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:42,316
I ended up goin' to prison.
Didn't I?

363
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:44,986
HMP Belmarsh,
or as I came to know it,

364
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:48,390
Horrible Motherfuckin'
Piss-hole Belmarsh.

365
00:22:48,392 --> 00:22:53,263
The filthiest, most violent and
godforsaken prison in England.

366
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:58,332
Yeah, that was where
that joke of a judge sent me.

367
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:02,336
I didn't have a criminal record,
I never had that mindset.

368
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:04,639
You know, I couldn't even
throw a fuckin' boxing match,

369
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:07,643
but they threw me in there
with those hardened murderers,

370
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:10,612
rapists, serial offenders.

371
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:14,284
There's a reason why they call
that place the Meatgrinder.

372
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:34,270
Say excuse me, cunt.

373
00:23:35,406 --> 00:23:37,038
Excuse me, cunt.

374
00:25:11,902 --> 00:25:14,537
Jaw seems to be healing nicely.

375
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:20,842
Now, they would've given you the
normal dentures if you just asked.

376
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:24,446
- Yeah, I did.
- You should've said please.

377
00:25:24,448 --> 00:25:26,748
Now, if it bothers you
that much,

378
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,650
when you get out of prison,
just get 'em switched.

379
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,486
It's an easy procedure.

380
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,457
Do you know what?
I don't mind 'em.

381
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:38,526
Make me look scary as fuck.

382
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:52,175
Hi, Mum.

383
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,649
Take a seat.

384
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,389
What happened, son?
Your teeth!

385
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:10,592
Yeah, I know.
Got into a bit of a scuffle.

386
00:26:10,594 --> 00:26:14,228
- Why is it always you?
- It's not always me, Mum.

387
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,898
I'm in prison, aren't I?
What do you expect?

388
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,534
This is what I expected.

389
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:23,639
I'd hoped you'd
learn something in here.

390
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:25,440
Get a bit of a kick
up the backside.

391
00:26:25,442 --> 00:26:27,308
I'm gettin' a kick
up the backside, all right.

392
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,677
- Don't worry about that.
- Nothing to be proud of.

393
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,912
- I'm not proud of it.
- I'm just...

394
00:26:30,914 --> 00:26:32,581
worried about you, son.

395
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,416
I don't...

396
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:38,287
I don't know what to say, to do.

397
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:42,424
- I spoke to another lawyer.
- Yeah?

398
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:46,261
But I ain't got the money
to pay 'em. Neither do you.

399
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:48,731
What's Lincoln say about it?

400
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,800
Well, Lincoln don't talk to me
about that sort of thing.

401
00:26:51,802 --> 00:26:53,869
Lincoln does his own thing.

402
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:56,304
Has he said anything about me?

403
00:26:56,306 --> 00:26:58,908
He said it's your own fault
for gettin' in trouble.

404
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:03,512
- Fuck's sake, Mum!
- Don't talk to me in that language!

405
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:06,515
I brung you up to be better
than the animals in here.

406
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:09,484
Don't stoop to their level.

407
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:13,822
- No, I'm sorry, Mum.
- Lincoln has his work.

408
00:27:13,824 --> 00:27:17,693
And whatever you say about him,
he ain't in jail.

409
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:21,296
He ain't the one keeping me
awake at night, worryin'.

410
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:23,032
Lincoln needs to come down here
and talk me, all right?

411
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:26,535
You gotta tell him to come here
and talk to me.

412
00:27:26,537 --> 00:27:29,871
I'll tell him, son.

413
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:32,209
No touching.

414
00:27:37,815 --> 00:27:39,650
I'm sorry, Mum.

415
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,695
I didn't hear nothin'
off Lincoln. Not a goddamn word.

416
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:56,868
- I was on my own.
- Ahh!

417
00:27:57,936 --> 00:27:59,635
So it was clear that I was gonna

418
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:02,272
have to look after myself.

419
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:39,676
Put it down!
Put it down now!

420
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:44,714
I didn't fucking do anything!
They jumped me!

421
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:47,750
I didn't fucking do anything!

422
00:28:47,752 --> 00:28:49,718
The Council finds it
reasonable to believe

423
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,420
that you were at least in part
responsible for the incident

424
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:53,956
that took place
on the 28th of June,

425
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:57,093
and it thereby
finds you guilty as charged.

426
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:59,595
I don't understand this, Your
Honor, what do you want me to do?

427
00:28:59,597 --> 00:29:02,731
They're comin' at me with a knife,
it's self-defense, clearly, right?

428
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,432
What do you want me to do?
Let 'em stab me?

429
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:06,035
- Order.
- No, I'm telling you,

430
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,602
there's people in this prison,
they're out to get me.

431
00:29:07,604 --> 00:29:09,739
I need a transfer,
I need it today!

432
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:12,909
Your sentence is hereby
extended by one year.

433
00:29:12,911 --> 00:29:18,714
Please, take the time alone to
reconsider your life decisions.

434
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,117
I'll consider the fact
that you're a fuckin' ponce!

435
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,587
For what?! Fuckin' defending
myself, that's for what!

436
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:26,755
- You fuckin' stupid cunt!
- Come on.

437
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:28,157
You haven't got a fuckin' clue,
have ya?

438
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,092
You sit there in your fuckin'...

439
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:31,459
fuckin' suit and tie, huh?

440
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:32,829
You haven't got a fucking clue!

441
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:34,931
Nothing
could have prepared me

442
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:38,700
for the shit that I was about
to go through in this hellhole.

443
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:40,569
So I had to make a choice.

444
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,606
If I was gonna get through
this stretch in one piece...

445
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:47,009
Talkin' to me, mate. Yeah?
Talkin' to me, yeah? Pa-pow!

446
00:29:47,011 --> 00:29:49,945
...then I was gonna
have to treat this like a fight.

447
00:29:49,947 --> 00:29:53,415
You fuckin' want it? Pa-pow!

448
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,417
That's what I'm talkin' about,
mate. Yeah?

449
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,687
Come back here, get some more!

450
00:29:57,689 --> 00:29:59,589
I had to change myself
into something

451
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,756
I didn't even recognize anymore.

452
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,094
I'll fuckin' take on both
of you! Boom, boom, boom!

453
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:07,597
Wah! Fucking come on!

454
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,166
So as the months
and the weeks rolled by,

455
00:30:10,168 --> 00:30:13,569
I slowly but surely

456
00:30:13,571 --> 00:30:16,638
turned myself into what you see
before you now.

457
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,675
A hardened, rusty nail.

458
00:30:19,677 --> 00:30:22,879
You see, the body can be
strengthened to a degree,

459
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:27,449
but it's your mind that
makes you impervious to defeat.

460
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:30,052
Just like the skin
on your knuckles,

461
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:35,192
the mind can be made
callous as fuck.

462
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:38,828
Bodily pain can do that.

463
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,097
So I learned how to take pain.

464
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:43,032
But, more importantly,

465
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:45,668
I learned how to dish it out.

466
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,764
Come on, lads!

467
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:20,471
Come on!

468
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:26,943
You see,
the problem I had was why?

469
00:31:26,945 --> 00:31:29,812
Why did every fucker
in that place want me dead?

470
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:33,082
I mean, it didn't make any sense to me.
I couldn't work it out.

471
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:38,888
And then one day...
it all became clear.

472
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:46,531
Anyone else fucking want it?
Anyone else?! Huh?!

473
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:48,664
How are ya?

474
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:51,033
Hey. That's it.

475
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,902
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.

476
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:55,638
You're all right.
Probably a bit concussed, mate.

477
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,574
Don't worry, you know,
the guards'll land in a minute.

478
00:31:58,576 --> 00:32:01,576
Nothin' personal, Cain, ya know?

479
00:32:01,578 --> 00:32:05,781
Nothing personal?
Why'd ya do it then? Hey?

480
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:10,187
What you got to gain from havin' a fuckin'
skull fracture? Hope it was worth it, mate!

481
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:14,223
It fuckin' woulda been.
Twenty grand.

482
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:16,859
What ya talkin' about,
20 grand?

483
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:20,029
- Ah...
- What are ya talkin' about? Twenty grand from where?!

484
00:32:20,031 --> 00:32:21,697
Twang was hookin' us up, yeah?

485
00:32:23,634 --> 00:32:25,268
I think your brother's
bank-rollin' it.

486
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:29,805
What the fuck you talkin' about?
My brother?

487
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:32,641
I ain't joking, yeah?
I only did it for the cash.

488
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:35,578
My brother did this?!

489
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,814
You're saying my fuckin' brother
did this? My own brother?!

490
00:32:38,816 --> 00:32:42,084
My own fuckin' brother?!

491
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,187
Why'd he do it, Hyde?

492
00:32:44,189 --> 00:32:46,655
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

493
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:48,158
I've no idea
what you're talkin' about.

494
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,193
Don't you deny that.
Don't you fuckin' dare!

495
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:55,965
You and my brother had a price
tag put on my head, didn't ya?

496
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:59,036
Didn't ya?!

497
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,606
I can accept it from a dirty,
conniving little bastard like you,

498
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:06,876
but I cannot
accept that from him.

499
00:33:06,878 --> 00:33:11,048
Week after week they came.
One after another.

500
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,650
Sometimes, more than one. Do you know what?
It didn't matter to me.

501
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:17,653
Keep 'em comin', I said.
Bring on all comers.

502
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:19,755
Come and have a fuckin' go,
mate!

503
00:33:19,757 --> 00:33:22,691
The more that came,
the stronger my mind got!

504
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:26,164
And my daily existence
became about survival.

505
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:38,776
Fucking come at me?!

506
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:43,681
Come at me, then! Come on!

507
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,915
You fucking...!

508
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,253
- Oi!
- I bet you didn't know it's possible

509
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:26,822
to make your own napalm
in prison, did ya?

510
00:34:26,824 --> 00:34:30,427
Well, you can.
And it fuckin' burns.

511
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:35,000
Uh!

512
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:09,733
We hereby find you guilty, and your sentence,
Mr. Burgess, will be extended by two years.

513
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:14,306
Five weeks segregation
to commence post-haste.

514
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,177
Fuck you.

515
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:58,917
Ahh! Come on!

516
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,946
All I have is a dead inmate,

517
00:36:29,948 --> 00:36:35,120
and you had his blood
on your clothes.

518
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:39,189
Well, I'm adding an additional
year to your sentence

519
00:36:39,191 --> 00:36:40,890
for being a part
of the altercation.

520
00:36:40,892 --> 00:36:43,228
Likewise,
six months segregation.

521
00:37:39,117 --> 00:37:41,519
Fuck you!

522
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:12,418
It's good to see ya,
Mum.

523
00:38:14,353 --> 00:38:19,189
What's it been?
About three years, is it?

524
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:20,990
I did come to see you.

525
00:38:20,992 --> 00:38:24,628
They told me
you was in solitary.

526
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,464
- More than once.
- Yeah.

527
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:32,035
Anyway, your brother didn't...
didn't think it was a good idea.

528
00:38:32,037 --> 00:38:34,474
Too much stress.
And he's right.

529
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:38,041
Look at ya.

530
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:40,946
I don't know what you've become.

531
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:45,385
Something you need
to know about Lincoln, Mum.

532
00:38:48,988 --> 00:38:50,721
Probably not gonna be easy
for you to hear, but...

533
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:54,425
Well, there's somethin' I need
to get off me chest first.

534
00:38:54,427 --> 00:38:59,330
It's not easy to say,
but... I'll just say it.

535
00:38:59,332 --> 00:39:01,166
I've got the cancer.

536
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,702
I've known for a few months,

537
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,338
but I didn't want
to bother anyone.

538
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,374
I start chemo on Tuesday.

539
00:39:10,376 --> 00:39:13,711
They say it
might be quite tough,

540
00:39:13,713 --> 00:39:18,148
so I don't think I'll be able
to get in to see you much.

541
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,652
- I'm sorry, Mum.
- You don't have to be sorry.

542
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:24,656
Your brother's looking after me.
Every day.

543
00:39:24,658 --> 00:39:28,160
Bless him, I don't know
what I'd do without him.

544
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:31,629
We'll be okay.

545
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:35,299
And what was it you wanted
to tell me about Lincoln?

546
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:37,735
Oh, don't worry about that, Mum.
It's nothin'.

547
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:40,771
- Oh, go on.
- No, it's...

548
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:44,175
- Aw, come on.
- I'm glad Lincoln's lookin' after you.

549
00:39:44,177 --> 00:39:48,112
That's... that's a weight
off me shoulders, you know?

550
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:51,147
Yeah, yeah. We're all fighters
in this family, aren't we?

551
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:55,354
- Look at you.
- Yeah, we're fighters.

552
00:39:58,157 --> 00:39:59,457
Right, time's up.

553
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:02,662
Come on, let's go. Come on!

554
00:40:04,095 --> 00:40:06,297
Never really knew
what your pancreas did

555
00:40:06,299 --> 00:40:09,001
till my mum's got
riddled with cancer.

556
00:40:10,804 --> 00:40:13,403
I still don't, really.

557
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:16,172
She was a fighter, my mum.

558
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:20,279
She fought that cancer longer
than anyone thought she could.

559
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:26,450
So they let me out for
just five hours to go see her.

560
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:32,091
Sent me with a six-man security
detail, one paddy wagon, two cars.

561
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:37,329
She died
before I even got there.

562
00:40:38,698 --> 00:40:40,764
I didn't know.

563
00:40:40,766 --> 00:40:43,067
I knew she was ill.

564
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:45,704
Sorry for your loss,
she was a fine woman.

565
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:49,507
I did know that some lad had
done for a couple of screws

566
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:54,311
and made a break from the hospital,
I just... didn't connect the dots.

567
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:57,481
Maybe you shoulda done.

568
00:40:57,483 --> 00:41:00,284
So how the fuck
do you manage that then?

569
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:20,705
Sorry about your mum.
I'm sure she was a lovely lady.

570
00:41:20,707 --> 00:41:23,542
But if you wanted to see her more often,
you should keep yourself outta trouble.

571
00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:13,190
- Can't let you go.
- It's all right, mate.

572
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:15,859
You aren't gonna say anything,
are ya? Yeah?

573
00:43:05,444 --> 00:43:09,514
Well done. I didn't
think you had it in you.

574
00:43:09,516 --> 00:43:12,584
Well, I'm not the same bloke
you left out in the cold, Hyde.

575
00:43:12,586 --> 00:43:14,919
I don't suppose you are.

576
00:43:14,921 --> 00:43:17,922
Right. That's it.
I need a piss.

577
00:43:17,924 --> 00:43:20,425
- Go in your fuckin' trousers.
- What?!

578
00:43:20,427 --> 00:43:24,229
- You heard.
- That is inhumane. I've got eight pints on board!

579
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:28,735
To be fair, none of us had planned
on being held hostage today.

580
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:32,604
I need a piss as well.

581
00:43:32,606 --> 00:43:34,739
Go in one of them bottles then.

582
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:38,642
- Nah. I need a shit.
- Piss in one of the bottles.

583
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:42,312
- And you can shit your pants.
- Uh, might wanna rethink that.

584
00:43:42,314 --> 00:43:44,683
Pretty sure none of us wanna be stuck
in here breathing this one's guts.

585
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:47,952
Look, whatever you're gonna do,
figure it out and do it quick.

586
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:51,321
Fucking zombie-looking bastard.

587
00:44:01,935 --> 00:44:04,501
- Oh!
- Stop embarrassing yourself!

588
00:44:04,503 --> 00:44:09,507
Enough of you and your silly panto.

589
00:44:09,509 --> 00:44:12,644
If you're gonna do somethin',
crack on!

590
00:44:12,646 --> 00:44:15,780
Because I am bored
of your bullshit!

591
00:44:15,782 --> 00:44:19,316
Oh, you want me
to crack on, do ya? Yeah?

592
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:22,723
Tell you what then,
turn around.

593
00:44:25,058 --> 00:44:29,428
Get on your knees. Go on.

594
00:44:30,362 --> 00:44:32,464
There you go.

595
00:44:32,466 --> 00:44:34,668
That's a good pig.

596
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:40,471
When my brother gets here,
we'll kick things off nicely.

597
00:44:40,473 --> 00:44:44,743
But until then, do me a favor
and shut your fuckin' mouth.

598
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:47,378
Or you'll be next.

599
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,317
You know, I don't
remember you being so drappy.

600
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:55,956
Or so gangsta.

601
00:44:59,526 --> 00:45:02,829
Oh, I've come a long way
since the blue bag day.

602
00:45:05,098 --> 00:45:08,933
When you sent me to steal
from Mabel Liddell,

603
00:45:08,935 --> 00:45:12,439
I coulda never imagined
where it woulda led me to.

604
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:32,559
Don't know why you're
fuckin' runnin', love!

605
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:47,039
Well, I'll leave you the purse,
all right?

606
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:48,542
But I'm keepin' the bag!

607
00:46:08,495 --> 00:46:10,664
Oh!

608
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:51,603
Mabel Liddell.

609
00:46:51,605 --> 00:46:56,541
Forty-nine, mother of three.

610
00:46:56,543 --> 00:46:58,978
Grandmother of two.

611
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,747
Worked as a dinner lady
at the local comprehensive.

612
00:47:02,749 --> 00:47:09,023
Died earlier this evening whilst undergoing
surgery related to a traffic accident.

613
00:47:11,058 --> 00:47:14,192
- Wasn't my fault.
- You stole her purse, mate.

614
00:47:14,194 --> 00:47:16,861
She chased you, and she ran into traffic.
That's a manslaughter charge.

615
00:47:16,863 --> 00:47:19,965
That and the robbery, well,
they'll put you away for this, Cain.

616
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:22,970
But... we're not really
interested in that, mate.

617
00:47:26,473 --> 00:47:28,806
Does the term "cuckoo"
mean anything to you?

618
00:47:28,808 --> 00:47:30,475
Cuckoo?

619
00:47:30,477 --> 00:47:32,510
As in the fuckin' bird
that can't build a nest,

620
00:47:32,512 --> 00:47:34,079
so it steals one
from another fuckin' bird.

621
00:47:34,081 --> 00:47:36,581
Oh, right, yeah.
That cuckoo.

622
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:38,082
Means fuck all to me, mate.

623
00:47:38,084 --> 00:47:40,485
So your brother
runs the largest entrapment

624
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:42,553
and cuckoo scam in the city.
The last three years,

625
00:47:42,555 --> 00:47:45,523
we've been working with people
who your brother's persecuted.

626
00:47:45,525 --> 00:47:48,726
Mabel Liddell refused to cooperate.
But we were observing her.

627
00:47:48,728 --> 00:47:52,563
Which means you're kinda fucked.
Doesn't it, mate?

628
00:47:52,565 --> 00:47:55,500
- I want a lawyer.
- You're incommunicado, boyo.

629
00:47:55,502 --> 00:47:58,671
You don't get a bloody lawyer.

630
00:47:58,673 --> 00:48:01,239
Usually starts
with a single family member.

631
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:04,243
Black sheep, idiot brother.
You know, your type.

632
00:48:04,245 --> 00:48:08,881
Lincoln, Hyde, any of these
other heavies that we know of,

633
00:48:08,883 --> 00:48:11,650
they'll end up paying the family
a little visit one day.

634
00:48:11,652 --> 00:48:14,752
And they'll say, "Well,
so-and-so owes us a little money.

635
00:48:14,754 --> 00:48:17,022
And he's in line
for a little belting.

636
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:19,590
But if you run us this little
errand, we'll let him off."

637
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:22,194
Family's too happy to oblige,
aren't they?

638
00:48:22,196 --> 00:48:25,797
Give 'em a little package. Tell 'em that there's
some drugs or some money in the package

639
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:27,865
and tell 'em to go
to such-and-such address.

640
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:29,902
What they don't tell 'em
is they hire another hoodlum

641
00:48:29,904 --> 00:48:32,271
to rob them on the way, mate.
Right?

642
00:48:32,273 --> 00:48:35,040
All of a sudden, there's a catastrophic
amount of money in that package.

643
00:48:35,042 --> 00:48:38,710
Now, this is the entrapment part.
The gang members want more, don't they?

644
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:41,546
So they show up
at the fuckin' house. Yeah?

645
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:44,750
They want the dole, they want the
check, they want the cash.

646
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:47,286
They take the fuckin' car.
They move into the house.

647
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:50,255
They run the operations from the house,
and they use the car to run the errands.

648
00:48:50,257 --> 00:48:54,126
They stay on the property until
all the assets have been destroyed.

649
00:48:54,128 --> 00:48:57,196
And then they just move
onto the next.

650
00:48:57,198 --> 00:49:02,767
Your brother, he does this.
Hyde does this.

651
00:49:02,769 --> 00:49:05,904
- And you fuckin' do it too.
- The fuck I do!

652
00:49:05,906 --> 00:49:08,609
Got no idea what
you're talkin' about, mate.

653
00:49:13,214 --> 00:49:17,082
"Albert Mitchell,
Pete Singlehurst, James Webb,

654
00:49:17,084 --> 00:49:20,753
Eric Godley, Sandy Park,
Miriam Silverman,

655
00:49:20,755 --> 00:49:22,322
and now Mabel Liddell."

656
00:49:22,324 --> 00:49:24,756
There's a 150
or so other families.

657
00:49:24,758 --> 00:49:26,591
Children have been orphaned

658
00:49:26,593 --> 00:49:28,027
because of your brother's
fuckin' business.

659
00:49:28,029 --> 00:49:29,728
So you listen to me.

660
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:31,997
And you listen
to me very carefully.

661
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:36,136
Manslaughter and robbery are the
least of your fuckin' problems, mate.

662
00:49:36,138 --> 00:49:38,170
I'm throwin'
organized crime at you.

663
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:40,272
I want a fuckin' lawyer,
all right?

664
00:49:40,274 --> 00:49:41,907
You listenin' to me?
I want a lawyer!

665
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:44,176
I don't know
anything about this shit!

666
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:47,046
- What about my rights?!
- Your rights are to give up your brother, mate.

667
00:49:47,048 --> 00:49:50,115
Thems the only rights
you fuckin' have.

668
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:52,885
This operation implodes
without your brother.

669
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:57,656
Maybe then a hundred or so other
people can move on with their lives.

670
00:49:57,658 --> 00:50:00,691
Come on, mate.
Give me your brother.

671
00:50:00,693 --> 00:50:04,165
Let's just
finish this right now.

672
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:11,070
How about... bollocks?

673
00:50:11,072 --> 00:50:13,005
How about that?

674
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:15,240
You're choosing the hard road,

675
00:50:15,242 --> 00:50:20,112
because you're goin' away
for a very, very long time.

676
00:50:20,114 --> 00:50:22,217
Sarge!

677
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:27,719
Come on in, Cain. Let's have
a little you-and-me time.

678
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:30,091
I don't know anything
about this.

679
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:51,176
Oh, I've got the devil
in me, too, Cain.

680
00:50:51,178 --> 00:50:53,946
But I learned
to accept my wickedness.

681
00:50:53,948 --> 00:50:57,883
I learnt to apply it for good.

682
00:50:57,885 --> 00:51:02,688
You see, I have always
been good with my fists.

683
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:07,092
O'Hara do this to everyone who doesn't just
bend over and get fucked then, does he?

684
00:51:07,094 --> 00:51:09,027
Oh, he wouldn't approve of this.

685
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:12,865
But then we don't have to
tell him everything, now do we?

686
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,174
I don't care
if you are the plod. All right.

687
00:51:21,176 --> 00:51:22,275
If you touch me again,

688
00:51:22,277 --> 00:51:24,177
I'll fuckin' wreck you, tough!

689
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:26,712
How do you do that with your
hands cuffed behind your back?

690
00:51:46,268 --> 00:51:49,168
Filthy boy.
Look what you've done.

691
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:52,171
You've gone and messed up my
nice interrogation room floor.

692
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:55,475
Do you know what we do to cats
that piss on the carpet?

693
00:51:55,477 --> 00:51:58,810
We rub their dirty,
fuckin' noses in it!

694
00:52:01,782 --> 00:52:04,349
Not so damned lippy now,
are you, boy?

695
00:52:04,351 --> 00:52:06,454
I'm gonna hurt you, Cain.

696
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,524
Open up!

697
00:52:11,526 --> 00:52:14,359
Open these fuckin' doors. Why are they bolted?!

698
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:18,531
About fuckin' time. Bez!
Unbolt them doors.

699
00:52:18,533 --> 00:52:20,933
Don't do anything stupid.

700
00:52:20,935 --> 00:52:23,138
Come on.

701
00:52:30,044 --> 00:52:32,278
What's happening? Why are
these fuckin' doors shut?

702
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,415
All right, lads.
Come on in. Don't be shy!

703
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:38,551
Make yourselves at home.

704
00:52:38,553 --> 00:52:42,455
Bez, shut those fuckin' doors now!
You're not going anywhere!

705
00:52:42,457 --> 00:52:45,791
Do it!

706
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:48,293
I can't believe this.
So good to see you, brother.

707
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:51,296
The only thing
that matters is you're out.

708
00:52:51,298 --> 00:52:55,801
And you've come to me for help. I'm your
brother. What's family for, after all.

709
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:58,371
Get back! Get back!

710
00:52:58,373 --> 00:53:00,839
You think I'm gonna
fall for that, do ya?

711
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:05,010
Weapons, mobile phones.
Put 'em on the bar!

712
00:53:05,012 --> 00:53:07,513
That means all of you!
Come on!

713
00:53:07,515 --> 00:53:10,850
On the fuckin' bar!

714
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:13,151
Drop your trousers,
lift up your shirts.

715
00:53:13,153 --> 00:53:14,886
Fuck off, you ain't serious.
We're not in prison.

716
00:53:14,888 --> 00:53:17,958
- I'm not one of your boyfriends.
- Fuckin' do it.

717
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:21,096
Do it!

718
00:53:31,473 --> 00:53:35,908
- You happy now?
- Not just yet.

719
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,545
Go over there with the others.

720
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:44,851
Bez, do me a favor.

721
00:53:44,853 --> 00:53:47,554
Do us another pint with
a nice, hefty head, would ya?

722
00:53:47,556 --> 00:53:49,356
Please!

723
00:53:51,459 --> 00:53:54,193
Why don't you just take that gun off
of Hyde's head and put it back on me?

724
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:55,928
Shut up!

725
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,031
You're not the one in charge
'round here anymore.

726
00:53:58,033 --> 00:54:00,198
I am.

727
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,568
Might have these monkeys eatin'
out of the palm of your hand,

728
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,370
but I know the real you,
don't I?

729
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:07,240
The cry baby that I pissed on
from the top of the tree.

730
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:08,908
Do you remember that?

731
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,878
Well, I'm back up
that tree again, bitch.

732
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,315
Yeah, I remember that.
I fuckin' remember it vividly.

733
00:54:15,317 --> 00:54:18,651
And I remember how I fuckin' beat
the life out of you for doin' it.

734
00:54:18,653 --> 00:54:22,955
That was then. This is now.

735
00:54:28,296 --> 00:54:30,963
Seven years
since I've had a pint.

736
00:54:30,965 --> 00:54:32,834
I'm playin' catch-up.

737
00:54:34,102 --> 00:54:36,002
Is he all right?

738
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:37,437
He's unconscious.

739
00:54:37,439 --> 00:54:39,639
He was in a lot of pain.

740
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:42,310
He's probably better like that.

741
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:49,948
- He's dead.
- You fuck!

742
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:54,053
Fuckin' hell, this is bad.
This is so fuckin' bad!

743
00:54:54,055 --> 00:54:56,456
Dumb cunt
killed Rook too, boss.

744
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:59,593
- He done what?
- Yeah. He tried to kill me and all.

745
00:54:59,595 --> 00:55:02,628
Then he comes in here and throws
Rook's hand on the fuckin' table!

746
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,664
Cain, you're not
thinkin' straight.

747
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:07,166
You are not fuckin'
thinkin' straight.

748
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:08,434
D'you realize what you're doin'?

749
00:55:08,436 --> 00:55:10,336
Yeah, I realize what I'm doin'.

750
00:55:10,338 --> 00:55:13,373
And let me tell you why.
For the last seven years,

751
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:18,712
I've been livin' with the threat of
violence hangin' over my head 24-fuckin'-7,

752
00:55:18,714 --> 00:55:22,148
never knowing where it's
comin' from, who it's gonna be.

753
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,250
I've been stabbed
half a dozen times.

754
00:55:24,252 --> 00:55:27,420
I've had me bones broken,
me ligaments torn.

755
00:55:27,422 --> 00:55:30,423
I've killed people, Lincoln.

756
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:32,626
With my bare fuckin' hands.

757
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:34,628
Prison's rehabilitated
you well, son.

758
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:37,697
Yeah?!
Have you seen this scar?

759
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:40,700
What about that, have you seen that?
Do you know what that is, mate?

760
00:55:40,702 --> 00:55:42,636
Do you know what they call that?

761
00:55:42,638 --> 00:55:46,038
It's what they call
a "napalm scar," that.

762
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,040
What about these fuckin' teeth?
Do you know what?

763
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:50,343
I wanted them to give me some of
them nice, white porcelain ones.

764
00:55:50,345 --> 00:55:54,080
But the prison dentist gave me
these fucked up amalgam ones

765
00:55:54,082 --> 00:55:56,115
because of my attitude!

766
00:55:56,117 --> 00:55:58,619
Yeah but, you see, you do have
a problem with your attitude.

767
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:02,188
Oh, fuck!
Stop doing that!

768
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,323
Look at you.
You're a loose cannon.

769
00:56:04,325 --> 00:56:07,193
Prison's turned you into
a fuckin' psychopathic killer.

770
00:56:07,195 --> 00:56:09,563
Prison didn't!
You fuckin' did!

771
00:56:09,565 --> 00:56:12,298
When you put a 20,000-pound
price tag on my head

772
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,500
in a prison full of rapists
and killers,

773
00:56:14,502 --> 00:56:16,602
who'd fuckin' strangle you
for a pack of cigarettes!

774
00:56:16,604 --> 00:56:19,338
- You did!
- What do you fuckin' expect,

775
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,508
when you start
fucking grassin'?

776
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,143
That we're just gonna fuckin' lay
down and let you fuckin' bury us?

777
00:56:24,145 --> 00:56:26,345
I never said shit to anyone.
I didn't say a fuckin' word!

778
00:56:26,347 --> 00:56:29,582
You're forgettin' we had
a fuckin' cozzer on the inside

779
00:56:29,584 --> 00:56:31,485
keepin' fuckin' tabs on ya.

780
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,555
Do you know what,
you dumb fuck?

781
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,123
Evans played you
for a fuckin' fool!

782
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:40,526
Told you a buncha lies,
because he knew that you were

783
00:56:40,528 --> 00:56:42,028
gullible enough to fall for it!

784
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,230
Your trusted a bent copper

785
00:56:44,232 --> 00:56:46,300
over your own flesh and blood!

786
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,801
I never said a fuckin' word.
Not a syllable!

787
00:56:48,803 --> 00:56:52,371
You're fuckin' standin' there, and you expect
me to believe that Evans made all this up?

788
00:56:52,373 --> 00:56:56,075
Yes, he made it all up!
O'Hara told me the truth!

789
00:56:56,077 --> 00:56:59,213
Do you know, when he found out about
Evans, he had him thrown off the force!

790
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:02,281
Why don't we just give fuckin'
Evans a bell, get him down here, eh?

791
00:57:02,283 --> 00:57:06,385
Let's fuckin' get him down here, and let's
just see what he has to say about all this.

792
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:09,258
Gimme my phone.

793
00:57:11,293 --> 00:57:14,596
I don't think he's gonna
be answering that phone, mate.

794
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,143
- You all done, boyo?
- Yeah, just finishing the sound check.

795
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:19,158
- Do I know you, boyo?
- We've met.

796
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,430
You was a sergeant back then.

797
00:58:23,365 --> 00:58:26,399
What happened?
You lose your job?

798
00:58:26,401 --> 00:58:28,671
Cain?

799
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:31,638
Fuck me.

800
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,410
Is that you, Cain?

801
00:58:36,511 --> 00:58:38,513
It's been a while.

802
00:58:40,516 --> 00:58:43,383
Johnny. Give us a minute,
will you, boyo?

803
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:45,187
Yeah, all right.

804
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:54,461
So then, Cain. What?

805
00:58:54,463 --> 00:58:58,465
I'm guessing you, uh,
broke outta prison?

806
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:01,568
You tracked me down
to this location,

807
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:06,373
to act your revenge
on the copper who booked you?

808
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:09,877
You didn't book me.
You set me up.

809
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:14,781
Told my brother I was gonna
snitch on him, didn't ya?

810
00:59:14,783 --> 00:59:17,618
"Hero Ex-Copper

811
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:22,689
Kills Escaped Convict
in Self-Defense."

812
00:59:22,691 --> 00:59:25,726
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

813
00:59:49,718 --> 00:59:53,553
Yeah, I did tell your brother you
snitched on him, you fuckin' cocksucker.

814
00:59:53,555 --> 00:59:55,990
I'm gonna make you
fuckin' pay, boy.

815
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:54,614
Well, it looks like we got a little
bit of a predicament, haven't we?

816
01:00:54,616 --> 01:00:58,920
Seems you been runnin' around all fuckin'
weekend on your own little revenge mission.

817
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:01,054
You're not
thinkin' straight, Cain.

818
01:01:01,056 --> 01:01:02,889
Because I know
I'm havin' difficulty

819
01:01:02,891 --> 01:01:04,558
takin' in everything
that's happened this week.

820
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,828
Been a tough week for you,
has it, yeah?

821
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:13,066
- Poor you.
- I'm talkin' about Mum.

822
01:01:13,068 --> 01:01:16,772
- Did you get to see her?
- Yeah, I saw her.

823
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:20,474
Lyin' under a white sheet.

824
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:27,414
You know, if I got there
20 minutes earlier,

825
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:30,017
mighta been able
to look her in the eye,

826
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:35,257
hold her hand,
tell her I loved her.

827
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,029
You know what them cops did?

828
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:44,000
Stopped off on the way
for a vanilla latte.

829
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,535
And where the fuck were you?

830
01:01:48,537 --> 01:01:50,704
Listen to me, I had stuff, I had
shit that I needed to deal with.

831
01:01:50,706 --> 01:01:52,339
Oh, you had shit
to deal with, did ya?

832
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:53,941
More important
than our dyin' mother?

833
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,443
Don't fucking guilt-trip me
on that one, please!

834
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:58,813
- Abandoned her, didn't ya?
- The fuck I did.

835
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,047
Who do you think paid
for all the doctors, huh?

836
01:02:01,049 --> 01:02:03,850
Who do you think
organized every day for her

837
01:02:03,852 --> 01:02:05,855
to be picked up
and taken to fuckin' hospital?

838
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:10,124
Have you got any idea how much it broke her
heart to come and see you in fuckin' prison?

839
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:14,494
Because of you!
I was inside because of you!

840
01:02:14,496 --> 01:02:16,696
You was the one who went
and got fuckin' nicked.

841
01:02:16,698 --> 01:02:20,568
You knew the risks.
No one made you do it.

842
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,971
You let me in,
and you threw me under the bus.

843
01:02:24,973 --> 01:02:28,375
No. No, no, no, no.

844
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:32,549
It was Mrs. Liddell who got
dragged under the fuckin' bus.

845
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:35,684
By you.

846
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:43,658
Listen to me. I know that life
hasn't been great for you.

847
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,760
And I know that I've
not helped over the years.

848
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,562
But you can put a stop
to all this.

849
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,664
You can fuckin'
stop it right now.

850
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:54,003
There's no one left, mate.
Mum's gone.

851
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:58,506
You can make a fresh start.
You're a free man now.

852
01:03:00,475 --> 01:03:03,677
What about the others?

853
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,681
What others?

854
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,885
Albert Mitchell,
Pete Singlehurst,

855
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,919
James Webb, Eric Godley,

856
01:03:12,921 --> 01:03:15,689
Miriam Silverman,
Mabel Liddell,

857
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:19,160
and all the other lives
you've been ruinin' for years.

858
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:22,530
This retard's gone
and remembered all the names.

859
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:23,797
Look, I'll be
honest with you, mate.

860
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:26,100
To me they were just another

861
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:28,669
fuckin' day at the office.
They mean nothin' to me. They were cunts.

862
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:33,641
It's a list of losers
tryin' to shirk off their debts.

863
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:38,980
Debts run up by smackheads and
pill-heads and all sorts of other scum.

864
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:41,949
We worked out a way of making
quite a lot of money

865
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,485
outta people that
wouldn't be in that position

866
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,488
if they'd kept their
fuckin' head on straight.

867
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,756
So you can take
your sentimental bullshit,

868
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:52,695
and you can shove it
up your fucking...

869
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,945
You fuckin' want it too?!

870
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,616
Do you know something?

871
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,021
I woulda given you the fuckin'
benefit of the doubt on Rook and Chas.

872
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,257
But what you just done,
you cunt,

873
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:24,961
what you just fuckin' done...

874
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,230
I'm seriously gonna
fuck you up

875
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:30,433
like you can't believe.

876
01:04:31,402 --> 01:04:33,901
You've really fucked
the duck now, this time.

877
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:36,137
There's no
coming back from that!

878
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:39,575
Maybe I don't wanna come back.

879
01:04:46,951 --> 01:04:51,252
- You recognize this?
- Should I?

880
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:54,188
Your accountant's gonna miss it.

881
01:05:18,215 --> 01:05:19,814
Can I help you, mate?

882
01:05:19,816 --> 01:05:21,917
You got a nice place here,
Stokes.

883
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:26,020
- Done well for yourself.
- Do I know you?

884
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,658
Oh, come on. You don't
remember an old friend?

885
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:33,295
Fuck me. Cain.

886
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:34,896
What happened to ya?

887
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:36,964
Oh, shit me,
that toast smells nice.

888
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:40,203
Do you mind
if I whack a 'round in? Eh?

889
01:05:42,206 --> 01:05:44,039
You have at least another
decade on your ticket,

890
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:48,275
so I'm guessin' you're
not out on good behavior.

891
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:51,212
Well, you got a good thing
goin' on here, haven't ya, mate?

892
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:55,651
You know, the wife, the kids,
little pet bunny.

893
01:05:58,756 --> 01:06:00,988
Are they aware of what you do?

894
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:04,927
How you ruin people's lives
for my brother?

895
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:16,637
I didn't take you
for the violent type, Stokes.

896
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,674
Sit down.

897
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:28,015
- What do you want?
- I wanna see them books.

898
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,318
I can't let you, Cain.

899
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:34,256
Take it you're aware my brother tried
to have me killed on the inside?

900
01:06:34,258 --> 01:06:37,326
Cain, you know
I've never been a part of that.

901
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,401
I believe ya.

902
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:48,969
I wanna take Lincoln down,
Stokes.

903
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,838
So you may as well
just show me them books.

904
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,807
And then you go
and get your family,

905
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:55,776
you get your shit together,
and you get the fuck gone.

906
01:06:55,778 --> 01:07:00,750
If I just leave town, you
promise you'll leave us alone?

907
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:03,686
Give you my word.

908
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:12,026
How much has he got
in his accounts then?

909
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,395
Three hundred thousand
in his checking,

910
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:14,995
with several offshore deposits,

911
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:17,065
totaling out to about
two million pounds

912
01:07:17,067 --> 01:07:19,667
- across a few currencies.
- Tell you what.

913
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:23,372
Leave him a grand and a half.
Gonna move the rest.

914
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,341
Where?

915
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:30,746
Ah, well,
uh, that's the fun part.

916
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:34,950
Stokes was
a crooked fucker.

917
01:07:34,952 --> 01:07:37,151
Couldn't lie straight in bed.

918
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:38,853
But it didn't take him long
to make his mind up

919
01:07:38,855 --> 01:07:40,821
- and save his own ass.
- That's bollocks.

920
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:45,262
- You're fuckin' lyin'.
- You reckon?

921
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:52,100
I took a picture
of your account. See that?

922
01:07:53,937 --> 01:07:57,973
Two-point-two million
in dollars, euros, pounds.

923
01:07:57,975 --> 01:08:00,007
All of it gone.

924
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:01,876
I left you with
a grand and a half.

925
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:04,246
'Cause that's what a few
porcelain teeth woulda cost.

926
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:07,249
You're never gonna see the rest.

927
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:10,318
You sure are rackin' up the reasons
to get yourself killed tonight,

928
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,287
aren't you, my love?

929
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:15,257
I hope your little
revenge mission was worth it.

930
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:19,861
You hear that, did ya, Lincoln?
Key words there, revenge.

931
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:23,731
Everything I've done over the last
two days, it started with you.

932
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:28,003
And for what you did to those innocent
families, it's gonna end with you.

933
01:08:28,005 --> 01:08:32,974
When you die, the ledger'll
be erased, the debts dissolved.

934
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:38,213
And each and every one of those
147 families are gonna be free.

935
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:42,951
Those names... you see,
I couldn't help but memorize 'em.

936
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:46,522
Repeated,
time and time again in court,

937
01:08:46,524 --> 01:08:50,992
over and over
I heard those names.

938
01:08:50,994 --> 01:08:53,295
See, I knew it was
too late to help myself,

939
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:57,766
but maybe...
maybe I could help them.

940
01:08:57,768 --> 01:09:00,468
And maybe, one day,
I might get the chance

941
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,803
to be face-to-face
with my brother.

942
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:05,073
One last time.

943
01:09:05,075 --> 01:09:07,375
And when I found that purpose,

944
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:11,812
well, only then could I bear
all the pain and suffering.

945
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,448
Because now it all had meaning.

946
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:16,853
Now, it all made sense.

947
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:33,302
Look... I know

948
01:09:33,304 --> 01:09:36,870
it's your brother
that's out to get you.

949
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:42,210
So, I ask you,
why are you protecting him?

950
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:45,814
Roll over on him, Cain.
What are you waitin' for?

951
01:09:45,816 --> 01:09:48,851
They're gonna kill you in here.
You know that, right?

952
01:09:52,222 --> 01:09:54,590
Good luck, son.

953
01:09:54,592 --> 01:09:56,793
I'll do it.

954
01:09:58,296 --> 01:10:00,328
I'll do it on one condition.

955
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:04,034
My mum's in hospital.

956
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:07,405
She don't have long left.

957
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:16,344
I want to see my mum.

958
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:20,984
You let me see her,
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

959
01:10:45,209 --> 01:10:48,109
Christ, this ale
tastes like shit, Bez.

960
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:51,549
That's because I poured the
drip tray into yours, darling.

961
01:10:54,352 --> 01:10:57,919
It's about time we got on
with it then. Isn't it, eh?

962
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:00,622
Guess you got a pretty good idea
where this is going, Lincoln?

963
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:04,394
- Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.
- Yeah, good.

964
01:11:05,663 --> 01:11:07,496
They can all leave if they want.

965
01:11:07,498 --> 01:11:10,399
It's only really you
that isn't going anywhere.

966
01:11:10,401 --> 01:11:13,968
What do you say, lads?
You wanna get out of here?

967
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:16,507
Enough of this fuckin' bullshit!

968
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:20,008
We ain't fuckin' goin' anywhere!

969
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:23,345
I dunno, um... I'd quite
like to leave, actually.

970
01:11:23,347 --> 01:11:26,047
- If it's all right with you lot.
- Shut the fuck up, Tune.

971
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:28,016
Yeah, cool.
Sorry, Lincoln.

972
01:11:28,018 --> 01:11:29,320
No one's going anywhere.

973
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:35,657
You're gonna die
in here tonight, Cain.

974
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:38,426
You got two barrels.
There's ten of us.

975
01:11:38,428 --> 01:11:42,030
I only need one to blow your fuckin' head apart.

976
01:11:42,032 --> 01:11:44,700
Yeah, well, maybe.
And once you use that shot,

977
01:11:44,702 --> 01:11:50,606
my men are gonna take turns each
tearing you limb from fucking limb.

978
01:11:50,608 --> 01:11:53,609
And what have you actually
accomplished here tonight?

979
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:55,678
Look at ya.

980
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,947
I'll tell ya, shall I?

981
01:11:57,949 --> 01:11:59,481
Fuck all.

982
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:03,151
Absolutely fuck all.
You're a mess.

983
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:06,355
And the only thing you're
ever gonna be remembered for

984
01:12:06,357 --> 01:12:09,560
is being a fuckin' mess.

985
01:12:11,696 --> 01:12:14,931
I'm all right not being
remembered for anything.

986
01:12:17,235 --> 01:12:20,436
So let's get on
with it, shall we?

987
01:12:20,438 --> 01:12:24,239
You know, there's a
million nerves in the human body.

988
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:29,645
And you, as my brother,
my fucking brother,

989
01:12:29,647 --> 01:12:35,383
you have always, since the
day you were fucking born,

990
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:39,390
got on every, single
fucking one of 'em.

991
01:12:52,002 --> 01:12:53,469
Oi!

992
01:12:53,471 --> 01:12:56,372
Come on then!
You fucking want some of me?!

993
01:12:56,374 --> 01:13:00,308
Come on!

994
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:03,446
You cunts fuckin' want me?
Come on!

995
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:16,427
Kill him!

996
01:13:26,671 --> 01:13:28,204
Fuck!

997
01:13:43,354 --> 01:13:44,690
Fuck me!

998
01:13:57,435 --> 01:14:01,337
Come on then! This is fuckin'
brunch at Belmarsh, this!

999
01:14:01,339 --> 01:14:04,575
Come on!

1000
01:14:38,776 --> 01:14:42,079
Oi! Drop it!

1001
01:14:48,853 --> 01:14:50,886
Fuck me.

1002
01:14:50,888 --> 01:14:52,323
Fuck!

1003
01:15:08,406 --> 01:15:09,608
Fuck.

1004
01:17:39,691 --> 01:17:41,660
Cheers, guys.

1005
01:17:42,994 --> 01:17:45,430
Mm.

1006
01:17:46,531 --> 01:17:49,366
That's fuckin' good.

1007
01:17:55,474 --> 01:17:56,773
Oh!

1008
01:17:59,077 --> 01:18:02,078
Fuck's sake.

1009
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,415
I've only got
a few of them left.

1010
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:07,986
Lemme ask you something.

1011
01:18:09,922 --> 01:18:13,322
Was it worth it?

1012
01:18:13,324 --> 01:18:19,464
I mean, all this for the sake
of 150 pathetic, fuckin' losers?

1013
01:18:20,599 --> 01:18:22,565
Is this what you wanted?

1014
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:24,903
Not all I wanted, no.

1015
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:32,109
You're done.
It's over for you.

1016
01:18:32,111 --> 01:18:34,344
I've cost you everything.

1017
01:18:34,346 --> 01:18:38,648
All this, everything you've
worked for, is finished.

1018
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:40,350
You're fucked, mate.

1019
01:18:40,352 --> 01:18:42,552
Is that right?

1020
01:18:42,554 --> 01:18:45,089
That's right, yeah. Yeah.

1021
01:18:45,091 --> 01:18:47,556
Well,
let me tell you something.

1022
01:18:47,558 --> 01:18:50,593
Whatever satisfaction you think
you're gonna get out of all of this

1023
01:18:50,595 --> 01:18:54,597
is gonna be very
fuckin' short-lived.

1024
01:18:54,599 --> 01:18:56,499
Because I always come through.

1025
01:18:56,501 --> 01:18:59,537
You know that, bruv.

1026
01:19:08,147 --> 01:19:10,882
Answer me one thing first.

1027
01:19:14,119 --> 01:19:16,820
Why'd you do it, Lincoln?

1028
01:19:16,822 --> 01:19:19,558
'Cause of you.

1029
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:22,694
Because of you.

1030
01:19:24,529 --> 01:19:27,697
See, whether you
fucking grassed or not,

1031
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:29,499
people stopped respecting me.

1032
01:19:29,501 --> 01:19:32,702
And you know me, bruv.

1033
01:19:32,704 --> 01:19:35,705
I will not
be fucking disrespected.

1034
01:19:35,707 --> 01:19:38,675
So, between me and you,

1035
01:19:38,677 --> 01:19:41,878
what's done is done.

1036
01:19:45,084 --> 01:19:49,485
You see, that's what happens when you
get other people to do your dirty work.

1037
01:19:49,487 --> 01:19:51,988
You forget to check the gun
to see if it's loaded.

1038
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:56,626
Two shots, two barrels, and I've
already used both of 'em, you dumb fuck!

1039
01:19:56,628 --> 01:19:59,531
Fucking kill him!

1040
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:01,726
I think I'll call it
a night then, Bez.

1041
01:21:03,862 --> 01:21:06,165
Sorry about the mess.

1042
01:21:49,574 --> 01:21:51,674
Bring out
the crookedest bank accounts.

1043
01:21:51,676 --> 01:21:55,145
Ah, maybe 147
crooked bank accounts.

1044
01:21:55,147 --> 01:21:59,283
Divide my brother's
fortune by 147.

1045
01:21:59,285 --> 01:22:01,718
And transfer the money
to their accounts.

1046
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,854
You're givin' it away.
Are you mad?

1047
01:22:03,856 --> 01:22:06,657
No, I'm not mad, mate.

1048
01:22:06,659 --> 01:22:10,595
I'm thinking clearer
than I have done in years.

1049
01:22:11,629 --> 01:22:13,263
It's not much.

1050
01:22:13,265 --> 01:22:16,934
Only about 15 grand each.

1051
01:22:16,936 --> 01:22:19,036
But that's a lot of money
to some people.

1052
01:22:19,038 --> 01:22:21,038
Just here for my gyro,
Mr. Patel.

1053
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:25,742
- Yeah?
- Enough for a fresh start, anyway.

1054
01:22:25,744 --> 01:22:31,150
Or maybe... maybe
just enough to breathe again.

1055
01:22:33,886 --> 01:22:36,753
Just heard from
Albert Mitchell's nephew.

1056
01:22:36,755 --> 01:22:39,089
Another cuckoo got a windfall.

1057
01:22:39,091 --> 01:22:41,992
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1058
01:22:41,994 --> 01:22:43,594
That'd be the 12th one
today, actually.

1059
01:22:43,596 --> 01:22:44,995
Right there, Victor, please.

1060
01:22:44,997 --> 01:22:47,597
That is great.

1061
01:22:47,599 --> 01:22:51,103
Yeah, no, no,
thank you, right.

1062
01:26:47,139 --> 01:26:49,940
You're lucky this
didn't go to the Crown Court.

1063
01:26:49,942 --> 01:26:51,842
But as no one
apparently saw anything,

1064
01:26:51,844 --> 01:26:54,045
and the cameras were obscured,

1065
01:26:54,047 --> 01:26:56,114
all I have is a dead inmate,

1066
01:26:56,116 --> 01:26:59,450
and you had his blood
on your clothes.

1067
01:26:59,452 --> 01:27:02,953
I was tryin'
to give him first aid.

1068
01:27:02,955 --> 01:27:06,190
He had a shank so far
into the back of his head,

1069
01:27:06,192 --> 01:27:07,892
it was sticking
out of his mouth.

1070
01:27:07,894 --> 01:27:09,530
What exactly were you
trying to do for him?

1071
01:27:14,434 --> 01:27:16,901
Well, I'm adding an additional
year to your sentence

1072
01:27:16,903 --> 01:27:18,436
for being a part
of the altercation.

1073
01:27:18,438 --> 01:27:20,171
That is the maximum punishment

1074
01:27:20,173 --> 01:27:21,640
that I'm authorized to set.

1075
01:27:21,642 --> 01:27:24,477
Likewise,
six months segregation.

1076
01:27:30,517 --> 01:27:32,216
And cut.

1077
01:27:34,889 --> 01:27:39,889

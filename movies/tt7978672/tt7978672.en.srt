00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,374
Hey!

3
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:42,210
Hey! Ha ha ha!

4
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:43,911
Yeah!

5
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,313
Wa-hey!

6
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:48,350
Yeah!

8
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:54,416
We are not lost!

9
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:57,017
We are somewhere around here.

10
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,423
I told you, we're lost!

11
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,791
We should've brought a compass.

12
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,427
I don't need a compass!

13
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,899
No, that's east! We've been
walking north since we set off.

14
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,269
But... we turned west
at the river.

15
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:20,074
It's that way!

16
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:23,345
It's getting dark soon.

17
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:25,413
You play with your GPS.

18
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:27,382
I'm going this way.

19
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,378
Akito?

20
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,947
Akito!

21
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,583
Akito?

22
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:04,119
Akito?!

23
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:05,786
Akito?!

24
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:39,454
Akito?!

25
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,557
Jen, you seen the headlamps?

26
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,596
Hey, Jen?

27
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:57,097
Hey, Jen?

28
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:58,533
Y-yeah, I'm in the bathroom.

29
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,001
You know where
the headlamps are?

30
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,639
Oh, yeah, um... they're in
the kitchen. I'm charging them.

31
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:07,375
Oh, have you seen my phone?

32
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:10,978
No. Uh, but I'll have a look
when I get out.

33
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,548
Well, better hurry.
They're here.

34
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,717
What time do you call this?

35
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,554
Ah, you said 10am.

36
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,223
Yeah, on the road at 10am.
It's already 10:05.

37
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:24,192
Oh. How do you live
with this guy?

38
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:26,227
I just let him think
he's in charge.

39
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:28,061
- Hi.
- Mwah.

40
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,330
Oh, yours.

41
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:31,064
Ah. Thanks. Where was it?

42
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,434
It was just on the sofa inside.

43
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:34,402
You two - smile.

44
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,438
Aw!

45
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:38,239
I got that torch
you told me to get.

46
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:39,641
Oh, God.
Tell him about the torch.

47
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,342
Took out a second mortgage
to get that thing.

48
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:44,245
120 hours of full charge.
Worth every cent.

49
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,947
Guys, get in. Group shot.

50
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:51,586
- Alright, let's hit the road.
- Nice.

51
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,502
So, uh,
I read your latest article.

52
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:11,004
10 best bars in Bucharest.
Tough assignment.

53
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,174
Worst hangover I ever had.

54
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,442
You've got the cushiest job.

55
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:18,112
This might be a little tricky,
though. But it'll be worth it.

56
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:19,414
How'd you find out about it?

57
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:21,783
Oh, my mate Cash.
He runs tours out of Cairns.

58
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:23,384
Cash?

59
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,420
You'll see.

60
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:27,589
So, anyway, we're over
in Puerto Escondido.

61
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:29,724
I look across
and I see this crazy bastard.

62
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,593
He paddles into
this monster wave.

63
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,595
This thing was huge.
It was near vertical, right?

64
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,630
He gets completely wiped out.
Fucking boom!

65
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:39,032
Like, this thing explodes
on this head, right?

66
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,270
So I race over on the ski and I
had to haul his sorry arse out.

67
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:43,705
Oh, get off!

68
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,406
- I see what you mean.
- Mm-hm.

69
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,609
So, this cave?

70
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:48,643
Mmm.

71
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:52,680
What I can tell you is
this thing is unexplored.

72
00:06:52,714 --> 00:06:55,183
Right? You won't find this
on any of your caving websites.

73
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:59,487
Yeah, see, that part doesn't
really excite me very much.

74
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,657
It's all good, mate.

75
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:09,664
I cannot believe
I let Eric talk me into this.

76
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,066
You say that every time.

77
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:16,804
What is that, water?

78
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:18,706
Not pregnant, are you?

79
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:25,713
Wait. You're not?

80
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:27,682
Oh, wow! Really?
That is amazing!

81
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:29,584
Yes, but please
don't say anything, OK?

82
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,119
I haven't even told Viktor.

83
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:34,656
Why? He's gonna be
so excited when you tell him.

84
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:35,757
Yeah.

85
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,361
It's just... not something
we've ever spoken about.

86
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:42,630
- Well, surely...
- And what about you?

87
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,768
No, Eric would freak out.

88
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:54,442
You know, things have been
kind of... bad for us. Um...

89
00:07:57,312 --> 00:08:00,515
Sometimes I get the feeling
he's keeping his options open.

90
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:04,586
Well, remember Simmo?

91
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,321
Remember that time
when he was like...

92
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:07,589
..he's coming off
the bloody pier

93
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:08,890
and he's straight into
the water?

94
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,091
Simmo's bloody mad, that guy.

95
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,395
You want to dance?

96
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:18,499
Yeah?

97
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:58,840
What?

98
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:02,510
Nothing.

99
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,448
Let's not do this.

100
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:10,218
Let's just go somewhere
by ourselves, huh?

101
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:11,786
Like an island.

102
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:16,758
We can sit on a beach, get
massages, order room service...

103
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,894
I thought you said
going into remission

104
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,896
meant you want to
live life to the full.

105
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:24,899
I do. It's just...

106
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,802
I mean, don't you want to
experience something new?

107
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:33,241
Eric can send me the photos

108
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:36,344
and I'll make
the experience part up.

109
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:39,180
I write most of my stuff
from the hotel anyway.

110
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:42,950
I think it's time
you experience the real thing.

111
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:46,854
- Really?
- Yeah.

112
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,795
- Morning, Prince Charming.
- Morning.

113
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,331
Hey, don't forget,
I found this cave.

114
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:58,700
I'm going in first, alright?

115
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,401
Thought we were gonna
toss for it.

116
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:01,969
Toss this.

117
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:15,483
So, how did you
find this cave?

118
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,018
I was in
a search party last week

119
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,587
looking for those missing
Japanese bushwalkers.

120
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,322
I was searching
through the forest

121
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,890
and I stumbled across
this shaft.

122
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:26,394
I shine my torch in.
This thing goes way down.

123
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:28,529
Any luck, she'll lead
to a bigger system

124
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:31,532
and, uh... we can start
making some money.

125
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:33,568
And what if it doesn't?

126
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:34,836
Well, then we'll be
back in town

127
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,504
in time for another party,
then, won't we?

128
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:38,506
Eric's shout.

129
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:50,785
Did you see that?

130
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,353
Oh, yeah.

131
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,688
Hey, are there many crocs
around here?

132
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:56,657
Yeah, a few,
now that we can't cull 'em.

133
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,060
Relax.

134
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,963
If some nasty croc thinks
he's got an easy lunch...

135
00:11:02,597 --> 00:11:04,332
- Jesus!
- Whoa! What the fuck?!

136
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:07,869
What? It's not loaded!
The clip's in the glove box.

137
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:13,007
Did you ever find
those missing tourists?

138
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:16,878
Nah, not yet.

139
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:39,567
Yeah, this is it.

140
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:54,549
- So, where is it?
- It's up through there.

141
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,398
What do you reckon?

142
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:13,734
Yeah, it's moving south.
We'll be fine.

143
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,573
Welcome to Cash's Cave.

144
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,719
Well? What do you think?

145
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:07,955
Let's go find out.

146
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:22,170
Looking good.

147
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:24,605
You ready, big fella?

148
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:26,707
Yeah, it's all good.

149
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:28,476
You can go first.

150
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:30,011
You've never done this before,
have you?

151
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,213
Yes, course I have.

152
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:33,115
Wrong way round, mate.

153
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:34,916
Huh?

154
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,087
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

155
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:41,555
So, when you're on,

156
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:43,191
it's one hand on the brake
all the way down.

157
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:44,725
Mm.

158
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,827
- Right, be careful.
- See you at the bottom.

159
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,864
Yeew!

160
00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:09,684
Ready?

161
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:12,653
Ready as I'll ever be.

162
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,533
Whew!

163
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,202
- You right?
- Yeah, totally.

164
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,108
Whew!

165
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,787
That's it. Nice work,
guys. Almost there.

166
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:51,193
Keep coming.

167
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:52,994
Nice!

168
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,697
Attaboy.

169
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,734
Nice.

170
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:15,683
Look. Over here.

171
00:15:21,156 --> 00:15:23,057
What do you reckon?

172
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,231
Uh... what if there are
snakes in there?

173
00:15:29,264 --> 00:15:31,599
Eric will get bitten first,
then, won't he?

174
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,903
Go.

175
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,543
After you.

176
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:44,678
Oh, God.

177
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:47,048
Alright.

178
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:52,787
Here we go.

179
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,803
Hope no-one's claustrophobic.

180
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:45,107
Probably should've asked that
before we came down here.

181
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,342
Mmm.

182
00:16:57,285 --> 00:16:58,386
Oh!

183
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,621
- You right?
- Yep.

184
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,762
Everyone OK?

185
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:10,232
Yeah.

186
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:12,633
This looks promising.

187
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:16,804
I wonder
how far it goes.

188
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:24,212
What if we get lost down here?

189
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:26,414
I mean, no-one knows
we're down here, right?

190
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:27,915
I don't know.

191
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:30,885
We won't get lost.
We should keep moving.

192
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,054
Yep.

193
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:41,795
Come on. I've got
a good feeling about this.

194
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:45,799
Lead the way.

195
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,743
Oi, check this out.

196
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:58,812
- Oh!
- Oh, what is that?

197
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:03,017
It looks like a...
a goat or something.

198
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,287
So, we're not
the first ones down here, then.

199
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,022
How did it get down here?

200
00:18:20,302 --> 00:18:22,703
Where do you reckon
that's coming from?

201
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:28,075
Just seepage.

202
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:23,931
Careful, guys.
Gets a bit tighter up here.

203
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:42,816
Whoa. You feel that?

204
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,286
What?

205
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,421
Space.

206
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,865
Careful.
It's low right here, guys.

207
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:03,804
Watch your step, guys.

208
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:22,390
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

209
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,402
This is
what it's all about.

210
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:36,870
This makes it
a cave worth exploring.

211
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:40,108
Holy shit, man.
We are in business!

212
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:44,412
- What did I tell you?
- Yep.

213
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:46,548
Well done.

214
00:20:58,326 --> 00:21:01,129
- Let's check it out.
- Yeah.

215
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:05,400
Let's have a look over there.

216
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:10,070
You guys coming?

217
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:11,939
- After you.
- Come on.

218
00:21:11,972 --> 00:21:13,874
Watch out for this.

219
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:19,381
You good?

220
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:22,317
Cold?

221
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,152
Little bit.

222
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:26,121
Nah, it's not too bad.

223
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:50,111
You right?

224
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:52,480
Yeah.

225
00:21:52,514 --> 00:21:54,482
Don't need me
to hold your hand?

226
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,242
It's just seepage, mate.

227
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:55,643
Maybe.

228
00:22:55,677 --> 00:22:57,445
It's running pretty fast,
though.

229
00:22:57,479 --> 00:23:00,582
Yeah. Probably
a natural waterway.

230
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:04,419
Cave river tours.

231
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:06,588
Oop.

232
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:09,390
Oh, shit. Thought I checked
those batteries.

233
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:11,292
What happened
to the light?

234
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:12,760
Oh, shit.

235
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:20,033
I don't like the look of this.
I think we should head back.

236
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:22,504
Are you serious?

237
00:23:22,537 --> 00:23:26,441
Mate, this cave's
just getting started.

238
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:32,747
A little bit of
water's not gonna hurt you.

239
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:36,551
Oi!

240
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,188
Inspired?

241
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:42,089
This is incredible, huh?

242
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:44,586
Hey?

243
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:47,488
Hey! I think there's something
in the water.

244
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,824
What the hell is that?

245
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:52,660
I don't know.

246
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:14,716
Jen!

247
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:22,857
Jen!

248
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:26,628
Help! Help!

249
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:31,666
Jen!

250
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:37,872
Grab my hand!

251
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:39,507
Grab my hand!

252
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,514
Jen!

253
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:49,617
Viktor! Viktor!

254
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:52,487
Help!

255
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,456
Jen! Faster, Jen!

256
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,358
This way. Come on.

257
00:25:57,392 --> 00:25:59,260
Are you OK?

258
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,478
You're OK. You're alright.

259
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:18,980
You're alright, darling.

260
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:26,754
I lost my bag.

261
00:26:28,823 --> 00:26:31,325
OK. We'll find it.

262
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,529
We'd better.

263
00:26:34,562 --> 00:26:36,698
Had my keys in it.

264
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:46,741
Where in the fuck did
that water come from?

265
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,514
It was the rain, wasn't it?

266
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,851
Didn't you say that we were
on the edge of the storm?

267
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:59,353
No, that's got to be
more than that.

268
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:01,689
That river must have
burst its banks.

269
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,793
So, how are we gonna
get out of here, then?

270
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:22,443
Oh. Here.

271
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:24,979
- What? Hold on.
- Fuck!

272
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:26,881
Hold on. Hold on.

273
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,984
Fuck!

274
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:31,586
Does anyone have service?

275
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,955
There's not gonna be a signal
down here, guys.

276
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,625
We're gonna have to go back
the way we came in.

277
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,761
It's gonna be
underwater.

278
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:43,397
I'm not going underwater
in this cave. I'm just not. OK?

279
00:27:43,431 --> 00:27:45,466
Look. It's only
a short passage.

280
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,667
Once we clear that low rock,

281
00:27:46,701 --> 00:27:50,404
I reckon we'll be
above the waterline.

282
00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:52,874
Well, we could just wait
for the water to go down

283
00:27:52,907 --> 00:27:53,908
and... and then we'll...

284
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,710
..we'll just swim back out
the way we came in.

285
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:58,579
- No, we can't wait.
- Why?

286
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:01,449
The cave's filling up. Look.

287
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:03,584
The water's still rising.

288
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:06,921
We're gonna be in the water
whether we like it or not.

289
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:14,428
Fuck.

290
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,874
Wait. I saw something.

291
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:29,744
Before the water hit.

292
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:31,546
What?

293
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:35,616
It was over there.
I don't know.

294
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,826
I'm not going. I'm not going
back in the water in this cave.

295
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:47,428
Hey. Look at me.

296
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:48,729
It's only a short swim.

297
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:51,632
I'll go first
and check it out, OK?

298
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:06,948
It's gonna be fine.

299
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:09,584
Let's just stick together
and stay calm.

300
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:15,790
You right?

301
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:27,802
We need to find that backpack.

302
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:30,571
Alright? We're not going
anywhere without those keys.

303
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:32,707
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

304
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:03,471
What's that?

305
00:30:17,952 --> 00:30:19,854
It's Cash's bag.

306
00:30:26,194 --> 00:30:27,962
This is it.

307
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:31,065
I'll go down and make sure
we can get through.

308
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:33,534
10, 15 seconds max, I reckon.

309
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,603
Be careful.

310
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:39,573
What was that?

311
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,609
- Viktor?
- Where did he go?

312
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:43,945
- Viktor!
- Viktor?

313
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,814
- Viktor!
- Viktor?

314
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,616
Viktor!

315
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:50,484
- Viktor!
- Viktor, where are you?!

316
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:52,120
- Viktor?!
- Viktor!

317
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,088
- Viktor!
- Viktor!

318
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:59,860
- Viktor!
- Stop! Wait!

319
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:02,697
Get out of the water!

320
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,832
- Viktor!
- Get out of the water!

321
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:09,637
Viktor!

322
00:31:10,238 --> 00:31:11,806
Viktor!

323
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,141
Viktor! Oh!

324
00:31:13,175 --> 00:31:15,009
Get her out!

325
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,979
Arggh! Viktor!

326
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,048
Viktor!

327
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:22,150
Eric, get out of the water!

328
00:31:22,184 --> 00:31:24,852
Come on! Come on!

329
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,724
Viktor! Viktor!

330
00:31:30,925 --> 00:31:33,527
Get up! Get up!

331
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:39,734
Oh, shit! The bag!

332
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:46,241
Oh, fuck!

333
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:47,908
It's not Viktor!

334
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:49,777
Fucking hell!

335
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:51,413
Viktor!

336
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:53,115
Viktor!

337
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:54,815
Viktor! Get out of there!

338
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:57,252
- Get out!
- Get out of it!

339
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:58,986
Viktor!

340
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:01,323
Viktor!

341
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:04,025
- Viktor!
- Viktor!

342
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:08,562
Oh! Oh, it's coming!

343
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:11,266
It's coming!

344
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:13,834
Get him out of
the fucking water!

345
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:14,869
Viktor!

346
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:16,971
It's coming!

347
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:18,306
Oh!

348
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,007
Get up! Get up!

349
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,343
Run!

350
00:32:21,376 --> 00:32:23,245
No, no, no!

351
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:25,546
Get up! Get up, get up, get up!

352
00:32:27,382 --> 00:32:29,184
Oh! Viktor!

353
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:40,861
Viktor. Hey, hey.

354
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:43,265
Look at me. Look at me.
Can you talk?

355
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:45,133
- Yeah.
- OK.

356
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:46,801
Oh, God. Alright.

357
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,270
- Oh, God.
- Oh, shit!

358
00:32:48,303 --> 00:32:49,637
Oh, God.

359
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,139
Is he OK?!

360
00:32:51,173 --> 00:32:53,040
Is he OK?!

361
00:32:54,342 --> 00:32:56,278
Oh, fuck!

362
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:58,779
He kept
trying to roll me.

363
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:01,916
Move back in close.

364
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:03,684
Step back.

365
00:33:05,886 --> 00:33:08,656
Hey, buddy. This is gonna
really hurt, alright?

366
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:10,125
One, two, three.

367
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:12,227
- Arggh!
- Sorry. Sorry.

368
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:16,997
You've got to sit him up.

369
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:18,400
Up you get. OK.

370
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:20,235
- I'm gonna come up the back.
- Yep.

371
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:21,836
Good thing
he spat you out, huh?

372
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:25,739
Must've not liked
the taste of me, huh?

373
00:33:25,773 --> 00:33:29,043
Good work. Good work.

374
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:30,945
Thanks.

375
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:34,349
We need to get him
to a hospital.

376
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:04,044
This is one of our
missing bushwalkers.

377
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:18,260
Those painkillers
should kick in soon, alright?

378
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:32,140
Cash and I will go.

379
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:33,774
What?

380
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:35,443
Cash!

381
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:43,050
We've got to swim
out of here, mate.

382
00:34:45,786 --> 00:34:47,422
Did you miss something?

383
00:34:47,455 --> 00:34:50,358
There's a massive fucking
crocodile in this water!

384
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:53,794
Yeah. Is your phone
still waterproof?

385
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:55,829
Yes!

386
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:57,064
OK.

387
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,334
So we get back to the entrance,
get a signal, call for help.

388
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:00,868
While we're at it,
we grab your gun,

389
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,304
come back here
and kill the bastard.

390
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:05,072
Look, we just need
to get through there

391
00:35:05,106 --> 00:35:06,308
and we'll be fine.

392
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:08,909
Oh, we'll be fine, will be?
Yeah... No!

393
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:10,945
I've got my knife.

394
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:13,481
That fucking croc comes for us,
he's gonna get it in the head.

395
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:17,219
Great.
It's bloody Crocodile Dundee.

396
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:19,387
You can't be serious.

397
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,055
- He needs a hospital.
- Eric.

398
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:22,257
- Jen.
- Don't be stupid.

399
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,458
We're all gonna be
in the water soon.

400
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:25,393
Crocs are territorial.

401
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:27,429
He's not gonna be happy
till we're all gone.

402
00:35:27,462 --> 00:35:29,997
We have to try something.

403
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:33,501
Mate, this is madness!

404
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:36,338
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.

405
00:35:36,371 --> 00:35:38,440
Nup. Nuh. Fuck you.

406
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:47,915
What?!

407
00:36:00,428 --> 00:36:02,564
Eric, you cannot get
in that water.

408
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,532
What choice do I have?

409
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:16,877
W-wait! Wait!

410
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:19,880
Just wait a minute!

411
00:36:26,454 --> 00:36:28,390
What's he saying?

412
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:31,293
Cash!

413
00:36:31,326 --> 00:36:32,560
Alright!

414
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:36,364
Yeah?

415
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:43,471
Alright, this is what
we're gonna do.

416
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:46,840
We're gonna push that
out there,

417
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,009
and when the croc grabs it,
we go.

418
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:51,011
You got it?

419
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:56,050
That might just work.

420
00:36:57,352 --> 00:36:58,986
Let's do it.

421
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,886
Aaah!

422
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:18,065
Go. Whatever you do, right,
don't splash.

423
00:38:18,098 --> 00:38:19,267
Careful.

424
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,902
They're attracted to
vibrations, OK?

425
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:30,412
Slowly! Slow!

426
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:41,322
Attaboy.

427
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,057
OK.

428
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:09,651
Jesus.

429
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:18,326
Oh, shit.

430
00:40:09,511 --> 00:40:11,479
Stick together.

431
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:57,725
- You good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

432
00:41:33,828 --> 00:41:36,331
Shit.

433
00:41:38,366 --> 00:41:40,168
What's that?

434
00:41:50,244 --> 00:41:51,813
Just keep moving.

435
00:42:05,493 --> 00:42:07,195
Fuck!

436
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:10,798
- What?
- I felt something.

437
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:13,201
You sure?

438
00:42:13,234 --> 00:42:14,802
Yes!

439
00:42:16,437 --> 00:42:17,505
Hang on.

440
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,440
What are you doing?

441
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:39,494
Nothing.

442
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:42,897
Let's keep moving.

443
00:43:08,022 --> 00:43:09,791
Hey.

444
00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:12,293
Here you go.

445
00:43:15,463 --> 00:43:16,698
- Yolanda?
- Yep?

446
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:19,367
Uh... have you got, uh,
Viktor's puffer?

447
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,270
- He said it's in your pack.
- Yep.

448
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:25,273
Take some deep breaths,
alright? OK?

449
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:26,774
Oh...

450
00:43:26,808 --> 00:43:27,642
Yep.

451
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:30,311
It's OK, buddy.

452
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:32,747
Throw it over!

453
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,248
Come on, Yolanda,
throw it over!

454
00:43:34,282 --> 00:43:35,983
- He's suffocating!
- Yes!

455
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:43,024
Fuck!

456
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:50,732
Uh... Do you have
another one of those?

457
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:56,304
- No!
- Slow down.

458
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:58,806
Hey. It's OK. It's OK.

459
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,576
Look at me. Look at me.
It's coming. OK?

460
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:04,612
You're gonna be just fine.
It's OK.

461
00:44:08,049 --> 00:44:09,851
Hey, hey, hey... It's OK.

462
00:44:09,884 --> 00:44:11,486
It's OK. It's OK.

463
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:13,755
It's OK. It's OK.

464
00:44:13,788 --> 00:44:16,891
Calm down. Calm breaths.
Calm breaths.

465
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:18,626
It's OK.

466
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:21,462
Calm down.

467
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:26,534
Yolanda, no!

468
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:31,973
Slowly!

469
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,976
Gently.

470
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:37,478
Don't splash, OK?

471
00:44:37,512 --> 00:44:38,980
Fuck.

472
00:44:41,082 --> 00:44:42,884
Fuck.

473
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:02,436
Yes!

474
00:45:05,506 --> 00:45:07,074
Aah!

475
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:19,954
Do not move.

476
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:22,490
Do not move a muscle.

477
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:48,749
Aah!

478
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:49,917
Go!

479
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,753
Go. Go, go, go, go, go!

480
00:45:52,787 --> 00:45:54,555
Come on.

481
00:45:58,459 --> 00:46:00,061
Come on.

482
00:46:00,094 --> 00:46:01,863
Come on.

483
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:05,700
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

484
00:46:09,637 --> 00:46:10,905
Here.

485
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:13,007
Breathe. Breathe.

486
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,809
Again.

487
00:46:14,842 --> 00:46:16,178
Breathe.

488
00:46:23,517 --> 00:46:26,888
Hi. It's OK.

489
00:46:28,623 --> 00:46:31,726
I'm here. I'm here.

490
00:47:13,701 --> 00:47:14,936
That hole we dropped into,

491
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:17,505
it should be
on the other side of this.

492
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,743
It's a bit of a swim.

493
00:47:27,215 --> 00:47:28,983
Give me your phone.

494
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:31,686
Hey?

495
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:34,655
No point both of us
drowning in that crack.

496
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:38,960
If you think I'm letting you
have all the glory...

497
00:47:48,803 --> 00:47:50,571
I'll see you on the other side.

498
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:52,740
- Righto.
- Yeah?

499
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:46,861
Aah!

500
00:48:50,265 --> 00:48:52,767
- No way through.
- How? It's...

501
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,903
The water... must have
moved the rocks.

502
00:48:58,306 --> 00:49:01,143
We've got to try to move 'em.

503
00:49:01,176 --> 00:49:04,279
- Let's do it.
- OK.

504
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:38,280
Fuck!

505
00:49:43,218 --> 00:49:45,853
We gotta... we gotta
go back down.

506
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:50,258
Mate, those rocks
aren't going anywhere.

507
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:52,626
We have to go back.

508
00:49:55,163 --> 00:49:56,864
Come on.

509
00:49:58,099 --> 00:49:59,934
Just give me a sec.

510
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:25,353
Eric?!

511
00:51:28,223 --> 00:51:31,892
Fuck. Fuck...

512
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:41,802
Eric?

513
00:53:54,935 --> 00:53:56,937
Aaagh!

514
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:03,345
Aaagh! Aaaagh!

515
00:54:30,705 --> 00:54:32,906
Cash?!

516
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:36,444
Cash!

517
00:55:00,268 --> 00:55:02,203
Fuck.

518
00:55:02,237 --> 00:55:04,004
Cash!

519
00:55:11,044 --> 00:55:13,080
Water's still rising.

520
00:55:40,108 --> 00:55:41,676
There's a breeze.

521
00:56:02,095 --> 00:56:03,631
Hey.

522
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:08,169
It's OK. It's OK.

523
00:56:09,404 --> 00:56:12,005
We're gonna get out of here.

524
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,108
- OK?
- Yeah.

525
00:56:14,142 --> 00:56:15,677
We have to.

526
00:56:17,145 --> 00:56:19,581
Yes, boss.

527
00:56:26,788 --> 00:56:28,523
Viktor, I'm pregnant.

528
00:56:33,595 --> 00:56:37,398
- You're gonna be a dad.
- Yeah.

529
00:56:39,834 --> 00:56:42,170
- I'm gonna be a dad?
- I was gonna tell you... Yeah.

530
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:46,808
- I was gonna tell you.
- Yeah.

531
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:50,512
I've just been waiting
for the right time.

532
00:56:53,581 --> 00:56:56,083
- I'm gonna be a daddy.
- Yeah.

533
00:56:59,487 --> 00:57:01,723
Hey?

534
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,805
Hey, I found a passage.

535
00:57:21,743 --> 00:57:23,811
Look.

536
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,420
Here.

537
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:34,722
Oh, baby.

538
00:57:56,444 --> 00:57:58,580
Where's Cash?

539
00:58:01,716 --> 00:58:03,484
He, um...

540
00:58:06,888 --> 00:58:08,590
What?

541
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,559
Oh, God.

542
00:58:11,593 --> 00:58:13,695
Oh!

543
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:20,668
Oh. Oh, fuck.

544
00:58:31,713 --> 00:58:34,415
Well, did you find a way
out of here?

545
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:39,220
No, it's blocked.

546
00:58:39,253 --> 00:58:41,422
We can't get out that way.

547
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,272
Hey, I think I found a passage.

548
00:58:58,306 --> 00:59:00,408
- What?
- It's up there.

549
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,615
Hey, Jen. Where's the Ventolin?

550
00:59:09,751 --> 00:59:10,952
Careful.

551
00:59:10,985 --> 00:59:12,220
Hey.

552
00:59:12,253 --> 00:59:16,290
It's pretty tight, but I think
I might be able to squeeze in.

553
00:59:16,324 --> 00:59:19,193
- Eric?
- Hey, it's alright. I'll go.

554
00:59:19,227 --> 00:59:21,796
We need to find a way
out of here.

555
00:59:49,991 --> 00:59:51,926
- You OK?
- Yeah.

556
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:57,732
This whole place is
gonna be flooded soon.

557
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:01,669
We need to get Viktor out.

558
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:06,507
We will. We will.

559
01:00:10,445 --> 01:00:11,979
Eric, I'm pregnant.

560
01:00:18,486 --> 01:00:20,455
Have you told Viktor?

561
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:24,193
Yeah. Just now.

562
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,975
Here.

563
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,882
That should help take
the temperature down.

564
01:01:00,695 --> 01:01:02,296
Oh, God.

565
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:07,869
The water's really rising.

566
01:01:27,655 --> 01:01:29,457
Hey.

567
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:32,660
Do you think you can
make it up there?

568
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:38,566
We've gotta move, OK?
Or we're gonna go under.

569
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:41,803
Yeah.

570
01:01:41,836 --> 01:01:43,004
I think so.

571
01:01:43,037 --> 01:01:44,705
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

572
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:46,607
OK.

573
01:03:04,552 --> 01:03:06,821
OK. I got you.

574
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:21,469
Hang on.

575
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:28,476
OK, we're there.

576
01:03:32,046 --> 01:03:34,482
It's OK.

577
01:04:47,088 --> 01:04:48,823
Aarggh!

578
01:04:52,227 --> 01:04:53,661
OK, that's it!

579
01:04:53,694 --> 01:04:55,297
Come on, buddy.

580
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,199
Gotta get up here.

581
01:04:57,232 --> 01:04:58,833
Come on.

582
01:04:58,866 --> 01:05:01,169
You have to get up here.
You can do this.

583
01:05:01,203 --> 01:05:02,803
Get up!

584
01:05:02,837 --> 01:05:04,071
Get up here!

585
01:05:04,106 --> 01:05:05,706
Oh!

586
01:05:07,242 --> 01:05:08,876
Come on.

587
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:10,745
Get up! Come on!

588
01:05:13,948 --> 01:05:15,950
Come on! Arggh!

589
01:05:38,906 --> 01:05:40,641
Here.

590
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:17,345
Yolanda's pregnant.

591
01:06:21,283 --> 01:06:22,983
I know.

592
01:06:26,154 --> 01:06:27,888
It's amazing.

593
01:06:29,224 --> 01:06:31,259
I'm so happy for you guys.

594
01:06:33,828 --> 01:06:36,063
We never thought
we could have kids.

595
01:06:37,265 --> 01:06:40,835
After all the chemo,
I thought I was sterile.

596
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:43,804
It's incredible.

597
01:07:14,702 --> 01:07:16,271
Fuck!

598
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:28,883
We're never gonna get
out of here, are we?

599
01:07:32,086 --> 01:07:33,821
We will.

600
01:07:36,324 --> 01:07:38,058
Of course we will.

601
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,151
What?

602
01:09:10,185 --> 01:09:11,952
What?

603
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:13,887
You're OK.

604
01:09:14,589 --> 01:09:17,359
- You're OK.
- Are they back?

605
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:20,462
No.

606
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:33,375
Yolanda's so sure
of herself, isn't she?

607
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,511
It's funny, um...

608
01:09:36,544 --> 01:09:39,046
Those two have always been
the adventurous ones

609
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:41,449
and...

610
01:09:41,483 --> 01:09:44,084
..you and I, we always just
wanted to sit by the pool.

611
01:09:50,292 --> 01:09:53,827
I used to joke
with Eric that...

612
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:56,096
..maybe we should
switch partners.

613
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,135
He'd laugh.

614
01:10:10,645 --> 01:10:12,414
Look.

615
01:10:14,382 --> 01:10:16,418
The keys.

616
01:10:17,385 --> 01:10:19,354
Cash's pack.

617
01:10:22,157 --> 01:10:24,992
Here. Hold this.

618
01:10:25,025 --> 01:10:27,429
Hey. Wait.

619
01:10:29,464 --> 01:10:32,300
- Jen...
- We need them to get back.

620
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:35,035
Hey, wait. Wait.

621
01:10:35,069 --> 01:10:37,071
Jen.

622
01:10:38,139 --> 01:10:39,873
Jen.

623
01:11:18,011 --> 01:11:20,013
Hey.

624
01:11:39,066 --> 01:11:41,935
OK. OK. OK.

625
01:12:07,262 --> 01:12:08,962
Fuck!

626
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:25,580
Jen! Jen, I think it's coming!

627
01:12:26,548 --> 01:12:28,650
Jen, get out of the water!

628
01:12:28,683 --> 01:12:30,418
Jen!

629
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,094
Jen?

630
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:43,665
Jen.

631
01:12:46,734 --> 01:12:48,536
Jen.

632
01:12:51,139 --> 01:12:52,674
Jen, can you hear me?

633
01:12:55,777 --> 01:12:57,779
Oh, shit.

634
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:03,016
Shit. Jen.

635
01:13:04,285 --> 01:13:05,753
Aarggh!

636
01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:08,256
Jen.

637
01:13:08,289 --> 01:13:10,124
Wake up.

638
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:12,560
Come on! Come on!

639
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:15,563
Come on!

640
01:13:17,165 --> 01:13:18,800
Come on!

641
01:13:58,239 --> 01:13:59,407
Viktor?

642
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,442
Viktor! Viktor!

643
01:14:01,476 --> 01:14:03,478
Come on, Viktor!

644
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:15,356
Oh!

645
01:15:10,244 --> 01:15:11,779
Jen.

646
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,716
Huh?

647
01:15:14,749 --> 01:15:16,517
Jen!

648
01:15:17,852 --> 01:15:19,420
I'm over here.

649
01:15:19,454 --> 01:15:22,457
Shit. OK.

650
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:26,628
Um... we're gonna have to swim.

651
01:15:26,661 --> 01:15:29,864
It's not far.
We'll stick together, OK?

652
01:16:35,463 --> 01:16:36,998
Hey. Are you alright?

653
01:16:37,031 --> 01:16:38,966
Where's Viktor?

654
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:42,904
Jen?

655
01:16:42,937 --> 01:16:44,739
What?

656
01:16:48,476 --> 01:16:50,278
He, um...

657
01:16:57,018 --> 01:16:59,487
Uh... you OK?

658
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,523
You OK?

659
01:17:07,929 --> 01:17:09,330
Wait, did you...

660
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,799
Did you find a way out?
Did you get out?

661
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:14,902
No, we can't get out that way.

662
01:17:19,907 --> 01:17:21,542
Fuck!

663
01:17:21,576 --> 01:17:24,846
Why did you bring us down here?
Why did you bring us here?!

664
01:17:24,879 --> 01:17:26,047
Jen, just calm down.

665
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,448
We're gonna fucking die
down here!

666
01:17:27,482 --> 01:17:28,983
Fuck, Jen, you wanted to come.

667
01:17:29,016 --> 01:17:32,487
- No, I didn't!
- OK, I get it! It's my fault!

668
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,675
When were you gonna tell me?

669
01:17:56,911 --> 01:17:58,613
About the two of you?

670
01:18:04,018 --> 01:18:07,522
- Jen, come on. What the fuck?
- I know, Eric.

671
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:10,992
Just tell me the truth.

672
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,996
Please just tell me the truth.

673
01:18:34,448 --> 01:18:36,450
It wasn't an affair.

674
01:18:38,986 --> 01:18:40,621
Then what was it?

675
01:18:44,425 --> 01:18:46,494
It was a mistake.

676
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:50,865
A mistake?

677
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,576
Is the baby yours?

678
01:19:28,903 --> 01:19:30,938
Oh, God.

679
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:50,024
Look.

680
01:19:52,227 --> 01:19:53,427
Sunlight.

681
01:19:53,461 --> 01:19:56,998
There must be a shaft. The
light's coming in through it.

682
01:19:59,201 --> 01:20:00,635
It's a down current.

683
01:20:00,668 --> 01:20:02,204
See the way the water eddies
near the wall?

684
01:20:02,237 --> 01:20:03,804
So?

685
01:20:03,838 --> 01:20:06,440
So... it means
the water must be

686
01:20:06,474 --> 01:20:08,509
getting sucked out there
somewhere.

687
01:20:15,082 --> 01:20:16,484
Like a plughole.

688
01:20:16,517 --> 01:20:18,619
It could be a way out.

689
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:21,522
We don't know it's a way out.

690
01:20:21,555 --> 01:20:24,959
We could get sucked down there
and drown.

691
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:27,028
Well, it's that
or wait here to get eaten.

692
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:30,998
We could get eaten
swimming over there.

693
01:20:31,032 --> 01:20:32,667
Yeah?

694
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,069
Well, I'd rather
take my chances.

695
01:20:36,938 --> 01:20:38,606
Jen...

696
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:39,907
What, Eric?

697
01:20:39,941 --> 01:20:42,877
You want to stay here too
and wait to die?

698
01:20:57,591 --> 01:21:00,027
Oh, fuck!

699
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:54,075
Hey. You're OK.

700
01:22:54,109 --> 01:22:56,744
You're OK. Just keep swimming.
Keep swimming.

701
01:22:56,777 --> 01:22:59,680
Nice and slow. You're OK.

702
01:23:01,249 --> 01:23:03,318
Oh, shit.

703
01:23:33,348 --> 01:23:34,815
It's coming!

704
01:23:34,849 --> 01:23:37,084
Swim! Swim!

705
01:23:40,288 --> 01:23:42,357
Go!

706
01:23:49,763 --> 01:23:51,266
Help me!

707
01:23:51,299 --> 01:23:53,368
Ah! Ah!

708
01:23:54,469 --> 01:23:57,004
Come on, you bastard! Come on!

709
01:24:01,243 --> 01:24:02,377
Eric!

710
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:04,279
- Go!
- Eric!

711
01:24:04,312 --> 01:24:06,080
- Go!
- No!

712
01:24:06,114 --> 01:24:09,384
Eric! Come back here! Eric!

713
01:24:09,417 --> 01:24:11,319
Eric, come back here!

714
01:24:11,353 --> 01:24:13,888
Eric?

715
01:24:13,921 --> 01:24:15,123
Arggh!

716
01:24:16,258 --> 01:24:17,892
Arggh!

717
01:24:17,925 --> 01:24:19,394
Eric!

718
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,732
Arggh!

719
01:24:24,765 --> 01:24:26,101
Eric?

720
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:28,802
Oh!

721
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:07,209
You're OK.

722
01:25:20,288 --> 01:25:22,123
Eric?

723
01:25:33,201 --> 01:25:35,370
Oh, fuck.

724
01:25:37,305 --> 01:25:40,074
Come on. Come on.

725
01:25:51,419 --> 01:25:53,854
What the fuck is this place?

726
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,261
Ohhh!

727
01:25:59,294 --> 01:26:01,762
We have to get out of here.

728
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:04,165
Which way?!

729
01:26:10,004 --> 01:26:11,839
Look!

730
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:15,277
Is that a way out?

731
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:18,546
Go! Go!

732
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:20,482
That's it.

733
01:26:41,001 --> 01:26:42,870
Come on!

734
01:26:46,441 --> 01:26:48,610
- OK.
- Quick, quick, quick!

735
01:27:01,088 --> 01:27:03,425
Oh, God. Oh, God.

736
01:27:06,361 --> 01:27:08,363
Oh, God.

737
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:13,501
This is the road
we came in on, isn't it?

738
01:27:14,636 --> 01:27:16,471
I think so.

739
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:07,355
Jen.

740
01:28:08,423 --> 01:28:10,023
I'm so sorry.

741
01:28:10,057 --> 01:28:11,459
Not now.

742
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:45,460
Look out!

743
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:00,941
Oh, God. Fuck.

744
01:29:02,009 --> 01:29:03,211
Yolanda, are you OK?

745
01:29:03,244 --> 01:29:04,978
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

746
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:07,382
- We have to get out of here.
- Oh, shit!

747
01:29:07,415 --> 01:29:09,517
- Come on.
- Oh! Oh, my God!

748
01:29:09,551 --> 01:29:11,453
Come on. Oh, come on!

749
01:29:11,486 --> 01:29:13,755
- Can you open your door?
- I can't!

750
01:29:13,788 --> 01:29:15,523
Come on.

751
01:29:18,793 --> 01:29:21,329
This is where
we just came out of.

752
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,102
Oh, my God.

753
01:29:34,142 --> 01:29:35,443
Oh, shit!

754
01:29:35,477 --> 01:29:37,412
Oh, shit!

755
01:29:37,445 --> 01:29:39,314
Oh, my God!

756
01:29:39,347 --> 01:29:40,648
The gun! The gun!

757
01:29:40,682 --> 01:29:44,185
Oh, my God! Get the gun!
Quick, quick, quick! Get it!

758
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:45,986
Did you find it?

759
01:29:47,054 --> 01:29:48,490
We need the clip.

760
01:29:51,292 --> 01:29:53,093
- Come on!
- Here you go.

761
01:29:54,195 --> 01:29:56,164
- OK. It's OK.
- OK.

762
01:29:57,665 --> 01:29:59,367
Where is it?

763
01:30:17,485 --> 01:30:19,821
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

764
01:30:19,854 --> 01:30:22,657
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

765
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:24,726
No! No!

766
01:30:46,147 --> 01:30:47,582
Yolanda!

767
01:30:48,616 --> 01:30:51,753
Yolanda! Yolanda!

768
01:30:51,786 --> 01:30:53,588
Oh, God!

769
01:31:00,695 --> 01:31:04,365
- Are you OK?
- My ankle!

770
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:06,434
Can you swim?

771
01:31:06,467 --> 01:31:08,770
We gotta swim down there.

772
01:31:08,803 --> 01:31:10,438
Come on!

773
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:32,226
Nearly there.

774
01:32:23,845 --> 01:32:25,813
Jen!

775
01:32:28,983 --> 01:32:31,219
Jen!

776
01:32:31,252 --> 01:32:33,454
Jen!

777
01:32:45,433 --> 01:32:47,835
Jen!

778
01:32:51,339 --> 01:32:53,641
Jen!

779
01:32:57,478 --> 01:32:59,814
Jen!

780
01:33:06,287 --> 01:33:07,989
Jen!

781
01:33:08,022 --> 01:33:09,991
Jen!

782
01:33:10,024 --> 01:33:12,727
Jen!

783
01:33:27,442 --> 01:33:30,511
Jen!

784
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,008
Are you OK?

785
01:34:04,846 --> 01:34:06,781
Yeah.

786
01:34:13,321 --> 01:34:14,922
Come on, then.

787
01:34:18,359 --> 01:34:20,828
I'm sorry. I love you.

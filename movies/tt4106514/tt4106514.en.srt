00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:03,937
If you get me my bag,
I can show you the receipts.

640
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,648
Like I said,
I'm a bit of a collector.

641
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:08,250
RIDDERWALL: Yeah,
we'll have it checked.

642
00:51:08,525 --> 00:51:09,901
JACOB:
She is lying.

643
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:11,861
Perhaps...
No.

644
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:14,072
She's too polished,
it's rehearsed.

645
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:16,533
You've got to push her harder,
trip her up.

646
00:51:17,534 --> 00:51:18,702
Let me in there.

647
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,954
Detective Kanon, please,
we have a process.

648
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:22,247
Your process sucks!

649
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:25,584
(MUTTERING
IN SWEDISH)

650
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,377
So where did you
travel to from Paris?

651
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:29,254
Luxembourg,

652
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:31,923
which I did not expect to like,
but we did.

653
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:35,385
The exhibits,
the museums, Notre-Dame...

654
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:37,220
Not the
Notre-Dame,

655
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:38,847
but, beautiful.

656
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:41,308
It is possible, I mean,
maybe it is not them.

657
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:44,978
No. They would have you believing that
up is down, that black is white.

658
00:51:45,729 --> 00:51:46,771
That girl...

659
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:50,442
That girl,

660
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:54,988
she killed
my daughter.

661
00:52:02,871 --> 00:52:04,706
I will stake
my life on it.

662
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:09,085
RIDDERWALL: Show me receipts
from the museums you visited.

663
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:11,171
SYLVIA:
I'm really tired.

664
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,173
Please,
have a look.

665
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:15,800
Okay.

666
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:23,308
I love museums.

667
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:28,772
See?

668
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:31,149
Forum d'art
in Luxembourg.

669
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:34,587
I still don't know how any of
this is relevant to what happened.

670
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,072
Hey, I am really trying
to be helpful here,

671
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:39,741
but can we
please go now?

672
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:41,159
Once again,

673
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:43,995
you arrived to London.
And then?

674
00:52:44,663 --> 00:52:47,040
From London,
back to Luxembourg,

675
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:49,876
then Czech Republic,
and now we're here.

676
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:51,638
And everywhere you went,
you paid with cash?

677
00:52:52,504 --> 00:52:54,255
You must admit
that's not common.

678
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:56,675
Do you know what credit card
companies charge in fees?

679
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:59,886
It's the only way to travel
and not come back to a mound of debt.

680
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,430
A prepared answer
for everything!

681
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:04,432
Each of us lost
our parents young

682
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:06,393
and we both got
a small inheritance.

683
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:08,728
MAC: Being alone
in this world,

684
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:10,522
it's made us
very, very close.

685
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:12,524
Can we go now?

686
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:35,046
Everything
they say checks out.

687
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:42,303
Sylvia and Mac Randolph,
22 and 19, reside in Los Angeles.

688
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,306
They have proof
of being in places far away

689
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:47,183
from when and where
the crimes took place.

690
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,644
They could've stopped in Paris
on their way from Madrid.

691
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:50,770
But we can't
prove it.

692
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:52,814
Well, hold them
until we can.

693
00:53:52,856 --> 00:53:55,296
But why would they go to London,
where passports are required,

694
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:57,026
or book a hotel
like the Six,

695
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,379
if they're trying to stay
under the radar?

696
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:00,443
To make it appear as if they've got
nothing to hide.

697
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:02,699
RIDDERWALL: Their luggage
contains no match

698
00:54:02,741 --> 00:54:04,221
for the clothes
in the museum footage.

699
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:06,619
At least
hold them overnight!

700
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,705
I can't hold suspects
more than 12 hours

701
00:54:08,747 --> 00:54:11,875
without a formal arrest, which I can't
make without sufficient evidence.

702
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,376
(PHONE RINGING)

703
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:16,421
Best we can do is order them to remain
in Stockholm as persons of interest,

704
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:20,592
mark their passports and
keep them under surveillance.

705
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:26,347
I mean, have you ever
seen a file so thin?

706
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,768
It's like until four years ago,
they didn't exist.

707
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:33,980
Interpol is coordinating
with the US.

708
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:37,358
If there is something
out there, they'll find it.

709
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,032
Listen,

710
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:46,701
I had this case once.

711
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:52,332
The beautiful daughter of the most celebrated
architect in Germany, beaten to death.

712
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:57,003
Her father hunted down
the guy who did it

713
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:58,463
and shot him
12 times.

714
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,134
Later, after the whole thing
calmed down,

715
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:05,595
he shot himself.

716
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:08,223
Well... (EXHALES)

717
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:13,770
I'm not real sure how you want me
to respond to that.

718
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:18,358
Getting justice
won't be the end.

719
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:24,322
You see, the problem is
every time I close my eyes,

720
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:26,991
the image
that I see

721
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,161
is my daughter
laying on a cold slab.

722
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:32,622
And that's never
gonna go away.

723
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:40,713
I have to go now.

724
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:44,842
Safe travels.

725
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:49,055
Wait.

726
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:01,401
Think of her smiling.

727
00:56:05,864 --> 00:56:07,115
How did you
get this?

728
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:09,742
Don't ask.

729
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:21,170
It is like I am bashing my face
into a wall

730
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:22,505
over and over again.

731
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:25,675
VALERIE: Hey, it's okay.

732
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:27,969
No, Val.

733
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,014
It's not okay.
I am telling you,

734
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:33,558
everyone has a history.
Everyone.

735
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:37,604
But these two,
there is just nothing.

736
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:40,064
It's like they're
goddamn ghosts.

737
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:42,525
Maybe I can
call in a favour.

738
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:47,322
Jacob?
You still there?

739
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:49,657
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here.

740
00:56:51,034 --> 00:56:53,077
I have some influence
with the DA's office.

741
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,540
Thanks for
doing this, Bill.

742
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:01,669
People keep asking what they can
do to help, and...

743
00:57:03,046 --> 00:57:05,465
There really isn't anything.
But I thought,

744
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,217
just maybe,
you might.

745
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:11,721
Does the name Simon Haysmith
mean anything to you?

746
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:16,392
You mean the guy who defrauded some of
the richest men on Wall Street

747
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:17,828
for, like, 300 million?
Yeah, that's him.

748
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:21,648
Yeah, the Feds spent a fortune
in taxpayer dollars preparing to prosecute him.

749
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,459
They didn't have
the case they wanted,

750
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:25,883
so they squeezed his employees,
his accountants, attorneys...

751
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,945
But none of them
said anything,

752
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:30,281
so, one of the biggest white-collar
criminals in history

753
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:31,491
was about to walk away.

754
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:33,701
What does this have to do
with Kimberly?

755
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:35,846
Well, they were just about
to drop the charges

756
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,950
when out of nowhere,
the case was just given to them.

757
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:41,709
Bank account numbers in Brussels, Cayman Islands,
and so on, and so on, and so on.

758
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:43,503
Somebody gave him up?

759
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,254
Who?

760
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,008
His son.

761
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,552
The son of a bitch's son.

762
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:54,013
Kid detests him,
wants him destroyed.

763
00:57:55,932 --> 00:57:58,810
Are you telling me
that Mac is Haysmith's son?

764
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:00,520
Yes, I am.

765
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:03,815
Do you have any idea
why he gave him up?

766
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:06,275
No, not from the little bit
I've been able to access.

767
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:09,862
The real story is behind a shit-load
of redactions in that file.

768
00:58:11,948 --> 00:58:13,241
Witness protection.

769
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:17,036
Was he a minor at the time?
Yup.

770
00:58:17,996 --> 00:58:20,396
That's why the Bureau has kept
tight-lipped about everything.

771
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,584
And how old
was he then?

772
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,712
Fifteen.
And the wife?

773
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,171
No mention.

774
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:28,673
And where's Haysmith?

775
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:30,800
Doing life at Osborn.

776
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:34,053
Well, can you
get in to see him?

777
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,471
Oh, I'm trying.

778
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,492
Did you
sleep at all?

779
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:00,455
You know when you look
in someone's eyes

780
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,540
and you know
they're lying to you?

781
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,293
They're guilty.

782
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:08,671
I've never been more sure
about anything in 30 years.

783
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:25,908
BUBLITZ: They've discovered
a fifth couple.

784
00:59:27,065 --> 00:59:28,357
Outside Amsterdam.

785
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,654
Artist's studio,
a bit away from everything.

786
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:42,163
The targeted journalist
was away on assignment.

787
00:59:44,207 --> 00:59:45,500
You know what
I'm gonna ask.

788
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,376
(SIGHING)

789
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,212
At least
now you know.

790
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:57,261
Yeah, at least
I know.

791
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:23,955
She collects them.

792
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:27,875
Receipts. She collects other
people's receipts!

793
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,628
Museums,
ferries, restaurants.

794
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:33,089
Physical proof
of places

795
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,632
they were

And Simon Sr
took her inside the house.

01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,399
And when they came out,
she wouldn't speak,

she had welts on her backside.

My neighbour
was cruel...

He demanded perfection from his family,
especially his children,

914
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:50,478
and if they didn't achieve
his high standards immediately,

915
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:52,087
he would
whip it out of them.

916
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:55,174
I told my husband
I had suspicions,

917
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,302
but he just told me
to mind my own business.

01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,142
GUARD 1:
Got 15 minutes, ma'am.

955
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:11,810
(CATCALLING,
WHISTLING IN BACKGROUND)

956
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:21,987
Forgive me
for staring.

957
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:25,032
You're the first good-looking woman
I've seen in a very long time.

958
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:30,370
Do you have a mind
to match that face?

959
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:35,250
A mind brilliant enough
to get me out of here?

960
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:39,922
We're building a case
to launch an appeal.

961
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:42,758
I found a number
of inconsistencies

962
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,010
in the evidence
provided by your son.

963
01:11:46,637 --> 01:11:48,722
Did they tell you
he defiled a de Kooning?

964
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:52,601
Those two had everything.
Everything!

965
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:55,979
You cannot buy the kind
of education they had.

966
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,359
Respect for money
is important to you, isn't it?

967
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:01,860
Of course.

968
01:12:04,613 --> 01:12:06,907
Listen to me
very carefully.

969
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:11,620
The sins of the father
this is not.

970
01:12:16,667 --> 01:12:18,210
Care to elaborate?

971
01:12:18,836 --> 01:12:20,003
Oh!

972
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:21,588
We have 15 minutes
together, Ms Kanon,

973
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,675
can we please not spend it talking
about these ungrateful bastards?

974
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:27,094
Let's talk about
politics, art.

975
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,764
Let's talk about the late works
of the Cubists,

976
01:12:30,806 --> 01:12:34,518
how the Expressionists
were a reaction to fascism.

977
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:38,105
Or how being sent to boarding
school affects your child?

978
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,650
What happened
to your daughter?

979
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:43,026
There seems
no trace of her.

980
01:12:46,697 --> 01:12:50,659
We're looking for cause. Why would
Simon Jr make up stories about you?

981
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:55,198
Did you know your senses get
heightened in this place?

982
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:58,709
I don't know why.

983
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:01,628
Perhaps it's all the noise,

984
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,256
followed by
the silence.

985
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:09,261
A father's duty is to teach,
and I did just that.

986
01:13:09,303 --> 01:13:13,098
I taught them culture,
ethics, morality, discipline.

987
01:13:13,599 --> 01:13:14,641
Is that right?

988
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:18,895
Oh, you're just like her.

989
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,151
Devious little bitch.

990
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:30,574
Young girls
need to be just that.

991
01:13:32,117 --> 01:13:33,327
Young girls.

992
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:45,881
You'll find them together.

993
01:13:47,633 --> 01:13:49,051
You can't
keep them apart...

994
01:13:50,594 --> 01:13:51,887
Except by force.

995
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:53,911
That's something
you're very good at.

996
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,724
Oh, are you
judging me?

997
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:58,852
Oh, I think
a court already did that.

998
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:01,897
Well, society is
full of wrong decisions

999
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:04,483
made by decent people.
Take me, for example.

1000
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:06,234
I met with you

1001
01:14:06,652 --> 01:14:09,196
because I actually thought
you might be able to help me.

1002
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:12,074
Well, that was a huge
error of judgement on your part.

1003
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:14,952
So I take it you won't be
handling my appeal.

1004
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:20,540
Enchante, madame.

1005
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,544
Enchante.

1006
01:14:31,385 --> 01:14:35,972
JACOB: It seems the majority of Haysmith's
rage was... Was focused on the girl.

1007
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:38,308
So, Marina gets sent away
to boarding school,

1008
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:41,019
and Simon stops at nothing
to get her back.

1009
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,772
That is
one hell of a brother.

1010
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:45,857
Unless...

1011
01:14:48,193 --> 01:14:49,778
Unless it's
more than that.

1012
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:51,905
What do you mean?

1013
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:56,535
Valerie said that Haysmith called Marina
"a devious bitch",

1014
01:14:56,785 --> 01:15:00,664
but he also said something about young girls
needing to be young girls,

1015
01:15:00,706 --> 01:15:03,125
and that it would take force
to keep them apart.

1016
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:08,255
Christ.

1017
01:15:09,798 --> 01:15:11,466
Mac and
Sylvia Randolph...

1018
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:17,973
They are Marina
and Simon Haysmith.

1019
01:15:19,433 --> 01:15:20,642
What?

1020
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:23,061
I mean, our suspects that we've been
chasing across Europe,

1021
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:25,731
they're not married, they're not...
They're not husband and wife,

1022
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,566
they are
brother and sister.

1024

1025
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:37,659
Head of
Saint John the Baptist.

1026
01:15:40,412 --> 01:15:42,956
A fitting tribute
to that sadistic bastard.

1027
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,085
We have to make sure
that everyone knows,

1028
01:15:47,794 --> 01:15:49,379
and most importantly, why.

1029
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:54,134
He took beauty and made it
cruel and ugly.

1030
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:58,930
Will they even let him see,
do you think?

1031
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:03,727
I want him to see
the destruction, Marina.

1032
01:16:06,188 --> 01:16:07,314
I want him to hurt

1033
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:09,691
like we did.
Hey, hey.

1034
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:12,069
I'm here.

1035
01:16:14,196 --> 01:16:15,238
I'm right here.

1036
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:20,077
We have fucked with
his notion of perfection.

1037
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:24,915
That'll get inside his mind
like no incarceration can.

1038
01:16:40,347 --> 01:16:42,432
I know I shouldn't,
but I almost feel...

1039
01:16:44,893 --> 01:16:46,311
They're playing out
their story.

1040
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:50,732
Look, The Kiss,
the pain of lovers torn apart.

Saturn Devouring

1042

the father that
destroyed their lives.

1043
01:16:57,948 --> 01:16:59,908
It all makes
horrible, twisted sense.

1044
01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:02,619
Love, pain, death...

1045
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:04,830
Completion.

1046
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:07,415
Yeah, but the last postcard
still had an ellipsis.

1047
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:11,419
They're not
finished yet.

1048
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:14,923
The message they're sending is
that their love is valid.

1049
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:18,969
They are angry at the world
for not accepting them.

1050
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,972
I think the murders in Brussels
were exact and purposeful,

1051
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:23,515
not random.
Why?

1052
01:17:24,391 --> 01:17:28,603
Because other forms of love, for centuries
forbidden, are now accepted by most,

1053
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,272
but not theirs.

To feel powerful
in the face of powerlessness.

1055
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:38,113
Yeah, exactly.

1056
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:42,367
What if we took that
away from them?

1057
01:17:42,993 --> 01:17:44,244

is using a bank account in Brussels.

in St Petersburg.

1125

they're virtually untouchable.

01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,419
a plane to take you

It was nice to have you
with me on my last case.

you do tomorrow?

She was happy.

Well, at least
we got something right.

I think
we got it all right.

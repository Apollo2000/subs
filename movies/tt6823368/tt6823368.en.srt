00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:30,038
<i>We keep bringing him
sacred food,</i>

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,839
<i>and nothing's happening.</i>

4
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:35,376
<i>I... The Beast,
he's shown himself twice</i>

5
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:39,548
<i>to the masses of the broken,
and-and they're not believing.</i>

6
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,950
<i>There's no revolution. I...</i>

7
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:44,886
<i>Dennis, do not be scared.</i>

8
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:49,324
<i>You have to trust me,
as you always have.</i>

9
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:25,996
Look at you all.

10
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:28,898
My name is Patricia.

11
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:35,772
Now, who would like
a PB and J sandwich?

12
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:39,107
You do.

13
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:07,201
Ooh! Boom!

14
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:10,204
Ooh!

15
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:12,340
Ah, look at.

16
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:14,409
Oh!

17
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:16,210
I am the master boy.

18
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:20,449
Superman punch, bitch! Yeah!

19
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:24,653
Hey!

20
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:26,988
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Get out!

21
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,958
You all right, brother?

22
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,221
Ooh, you see his bag fall?

23
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:03,925
It's what they call
dramatic effect.

24
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:06,961
This is gonna get
so many views.

25
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:09,199
That a raccoon again?

26
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,999
Did you leave the door open, T?

27
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:13,401
I closed it.

28
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,238
Hello?

29
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,244
Yo, who's there?

30
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,452
We about to Salt Bae your ass.

31
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:39,430
Superman-punch him, Ronald.

32
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,980
Oh, shit.

33
00:03:58,982 --> 00:04:00,917
It's you.

34
00:04:42,392 --> 00:04:45,293
They bumped into me
at the subway.

35
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:47,429
Can't just let 'em go, Joseph.

36
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:50,466
Weren't you on
a specified walk?

37
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:53,167
You can't run this
like the store.

38
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,770
It's potluck.

39
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:58,740
All things come second
when we're on a specified walk.

40
00:04:58,742 --> 00:05:01,275
The store works
'cause we have rules.

41
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:03,377
Hey, it was a good follow,
though.

42
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:07,415
"We gonna Salt Bae your ass."
What a douche.

43
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:10,086
It's definitely going
into the book.

44
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:14,121
"Salt Bae your ass."

45
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:16,123
What is that, anyway?

46
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,626
It's an Internet guy.

47
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:21,730
He's a butcher who salts
his meat in an elaborate way.

48
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:24,334
You got dinged.

49
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,570
Good news:
they're not calling you

50
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:31,440
the Tiptoe Man
or the Float anymore.

51
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:35,142
They pretty much settled on
the Overseer.

52
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:37,144
It's cool.

53
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:40,551
Do not mention
the Tiptoe Man ever again.

54
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,022
That's all he does?
He seasons meat?

55
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:48,724
Dad, you look tired.

56
00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:52,093
Why don't we save the next walk
for the day after tomorrow?

57
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:57,033
When we find this Horde,
I'll take a mental health day.

58
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:00,301
Okay. Fine.

59
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:02,403
I have a new tenuous theory.

60
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:04,773
Let's call it
Tenuous Theory Number Two.

61
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:07,375
The first set of girls
that were found mutilated

62
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:09,343
at the zoo three weeks ago
happened here.

63
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:10,879
The second set, here.

64
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,447
Now, these new girls
that went missing

65
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,449
create kind of
a messy triangle,

66
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,350
and where you were waiting
today at the subway

67
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:18,554
was in the middle
of this triangle.

68
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:21,723
In Tenuous Theory Number Two,
he isn't in this triangle.

69
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:24,493
He's coming from a place
that has easy access

70
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:26,294
to this triangular
feeding zone.

71
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:28,296
I think he's
somewhere here, Dad,

72
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:30,532
- in the factory area.
- Okay.

73
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:33,602
I'll walk around there
tomorrow.

74
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:35,269
Hey, Dad?

75
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,506
I'm checking
the police scanners.

76
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:40,475
They're looking for you
pretty aggressively.

77
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:42,209
Be real careful.

78
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:44,113
All right.

79
00:07:07,438 --> 00:07:09,771
Philadelphia
has a new tallest building.

80
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:12,741
The Osaka Tower is taking over
the city skyline.

81
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:15,644
The architecture makes it
an amazing sight to see.

82
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:18,513
And on top of that, it's
the ultimate in sustainability.

83
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,716
It gets its power
from solar panels.

84
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:22,551
Developers say it will
draw jobs to the city

85
00:07:22,553 --> 00:07:24,622
by the thousands...

86
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:46,477
Audrey, I have to tell you
something.

87
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:49,845
Audrey.

88
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:17,572
Miss Patricia said
that I'm not allowed

89
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:19,908
to play with you guys,
so don't even ask.

90
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,844
I had a girlfriend once.

91
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:24,780
You don't know her.

92
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:25,981
We kissed.

93
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,849
It's no big deal.

94
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,618
Stop messing with us.

95
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,819
What do you want?

96
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:32,454
Vera, don't get him angry.

97
00:08:32,456 --> 00:08:35,023
- He's sick.
- Don't tell me names.

98
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:37,258
They said not to ask you
your names,

99
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,030
because I might get sad,
you know, after tonight.

100
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:43,999
Why did you pick us, Hedwig?

101
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,300
Oh, uh, because you're impure

102
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:48,670
and you haven't done
any suffering.

103
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:55,342
You know that boy band stuff?

104
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,378
It's... some of it's okay,
but Drake?

105
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,748
Drake's my new main man.

106
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:03,785
The Beast is gonna come
for you guys

107
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:07,354
any minute now, and I...

108
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:10,792
I get... I get to greet him.

109
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:15,530
It's my big reward for keeping
the Horde in the light.

110
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:19,835
I get to take him
to the masses of the broken.

111
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:21,036
I better go.

112
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:25,507
He can come at any second

113
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:26,808
and I don't want him coming

114
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,778
and finding roller skates
on his feet.

115
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,649
Miss Patricia would find out,
and she'd get angry, et cetera.

116
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:41,857
- Thank you for coming in.
- Yep, thanks.

117
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:44,993
- This is an outdoor dome infrared.
- Mm-hmm.

118
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:47,394
We can use as many as you want
in the apartment building.

119
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:50,932
You use a 16-channel HD DVR
in your security office.

120
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:53,535
One of the tenants
got murdered off-site,

121
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:55,470
and people are on edge.

122
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:57,404
- They just want to feel safe.
- Totally get it.

123
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:58,974
I'm gonna take a walk.

124
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:02,110
Yeah, I don't think that you
need to take a walk today, Dad.

125
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:04,079
Maybe tomorrow or the next day.

126
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,884
No, I think I'm gonna
take a walk now.

127
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,952
Uh, you don't want
to take a lot of walks.

128
00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:13,622
You might get tired.

129
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:16,357
Let your dad take a walk.
Jesus.

130
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,761
Yeah.

131
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:20,729
Hey, do I know you?

132
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:24,398
Did you used to work
at the football stadium?

133
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,535
15 years.

134
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:28,703
I used to hang out
with some shady types

135
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:30,705
down at the stadium
in my youth.

136
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:32,808
Turned it around
with positive thinking.

137
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,747
Should I ring this up?

138
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,615
We're gonna have
to close early.

139
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:41,850
Yeah.

140
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:48,149
Peak transit time's over.

141
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:49,851
I missed him.

142
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:53,389
I'll come back tomorrow
when the factories are let out.

143
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:57,659
Can come back to the store
and we could do some inventory.

144
00:11:57,661 --> 00:11:59,094
Okay.

145
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:01,930
I'll see you back at the store.

146
00:12:08,872 --> 00:12:11,172
You guys like cartoons?

147
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:13,108
So babyish.

148
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,576
I don't.

149
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,111
I like documentaries.

150
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:17,812
You watch documentaries?

151
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:21,983
I watched a documentary
about, um, space.

152
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:23,852
It's real big.

153
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:25,822
Sorry, bro.

154
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,563
It's him. I saw a room.

155
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:37,666
It had red clay, piles of it.

156
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:39,200
It's some kind of factory.

157
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:40,568
They're all in there.

158
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,070
All right, stand by.

159
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:43,607
I'll search the area.

160
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:50,545
Dad, I found a brick factory.

161
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:52,213
Uh, it's old, abandoned.

162
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:54,785
- Which direction?
- To the south.

163
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,689
Dad?

164
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,525
Dad?

165
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:17,005
You said I could have some.

166
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:18,940
I know.

167
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:21,543
Taking everything for yourself.

168
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:22,779
Take some.

169
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:29,853
Hey. I...

170
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:35,290
Oh, my God.

171
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:38,026
You said I could have some.

172
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:39,963
I know.

173
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:47,904
What?

174
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:51,908
Huh?

175
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:56,079
Taking everything for yourself.

176
00:13:57,614 --> 00:13:59,981
I don't... know...

177
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:19,636
Who are you?

178
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,805
I...

179
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,610
am you.

180
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:13,156
Come on!

181
00:15:17,194 --> 00:15:19,863
Come on!

182
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:23,660
Where did it go?

183
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:47,382
Leave!

184
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:42,263
Don't, don't. Don't shoot!

185
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,933
We can work through this.

186
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:47,636
Just put the guns away. I...

187
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,371
What's happening?

188
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:51,939
I didn't do anything.

189
00:18:51,941 --> 00:18:53,575
My name is Barry.

190
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,076
All right?

191
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:58,146
We have to get Kevin
to stay in the light.

192
00:18:58,148 --> 00:19:00,181
Just-just don't shoot us.

193
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:02,016
Don't shoot.

194
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:04,921
He won't hurt anyone now.

195
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:09,223
You may find
your way out of here,

196
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:11,493
but you will have to hurt
a lot of officers.

197
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:13,161
A lot of people.

198
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:16,366
No one needs to get hurt
anymore, David.

199
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:31,379
It's gonna be okay, Joseph.

200
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:32,614
Take them straight to

201
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:36,017
Raven Hill Memorial, the West
Wing of Raven Hill Memorial.

202
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,090
Grab that poncho!

203
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:58,476
No trouble.

204
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:14,958
Keep moving.

205
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:17,626
Keep moving.

206
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:19,093
Please, don't. Don't.

207
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:20,261
- Don't. No.
- Easy. Easy.

208
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:22,096
Hey. Hey! Hey!

209
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:23,732
We're cool, we're cool.
Totally cool.

210
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,299
All right?
He doesn't like to be touched.

211
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:28,136
I can, I can walk.
I'll just, I'll... walk.

212
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:29,973
Keep walking.

213
00:20:59,202 --> 00:21:03,072
My name is Dr. Ellie Staple,
and I'm a psychiatrist.

214
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:07,208
This room must look nefarious.

215
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,078
The walls are equipped with
46 high-pressured nozzles,

216
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,214
all connected
to a 15,000-gallon

217
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:15,416
water tank outside.

218
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:17,486
It will only be triggered
if you are threatening

219
00:21:17,488 --> 00:21:19,655
or trying to escape.

220
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,958
This is a hypnosis light...

221
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:26,027
Dennis.

222
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:29,096
My pleasure, Dennis.

223
00:21:29,098 --> 00:21:31,232
You are being monitored.

224
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:33,100
If, for some reason,
there's a threatening identity

225
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,102
in the room, the light
will automatically strobe

226
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,639
and force a different identity
to take over.

227
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,106
Who was the man?

228
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:42,376
He was as strong as The Beast.

229
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:45,112
The man people in this city
have been talking about.

230
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:47,683
The only person
to survive that train wreck

231
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:49,551
all those years ago.

232
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:52,253
I saw a video of you fighting

233
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:54,590
near a fire hydrant
that erupted.

234
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:56,123
Saw you choke.

235
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,794
I think you believe
water is your weakness.

236
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:00,261
Where are you keeping him?

237
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,544
<i>Everyone is safe, David.</i>

238
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:21,550
Maybe this will all make sense
if I explain who I am.

239
00:22:21,552 --> 00:22:26,254
I specialize in a particular
type of delusion of grandeur.

240
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:29,156
I specialize
in those individuals

241
00:22:29,158 --> 00:22:32,093
who believe
they are superheroes.

242
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:34,095
I've been given three days

243
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:37,166
to treat you
by whatever means necessary.

244
00:22:38,836 --> 00:22:42,571
I came here for you both.

245
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:10,566
<i>Yo, this doctor comes in here,</i>

246
00:23:10,568 --> 00:23:13,200
takes over our wing,
tells us all new rules.

247
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:15,637
Rules of conduct.

248
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:19,307
How to treat people
with kindness.

249
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,743
My whole life, all I do
is take care of people.

250
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:25,279
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on. There you go.

251
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:27,516
We got along just fine
without her, didn't we?

252
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:28,850
Me and you?

253
00:23:30,854 --> 00:23:33,755
Anyway...

254
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:36,758
you won't be lonely anymore.

255
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,327
You have two new friends.

256
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:02,185
Casey, could I see you
for a second?

257
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,326
<i>I received a call
from your foster family.</i>

258
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:15,664
Apparently, it's on the news.

259
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,433
They caught the guy
who abducted you

260
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:21,202
and murdered all those girls.

261
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:22,938
They caught the bastard.

262
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,474
Your foster family is thrilled.

263
00:24:25,476 --> 00:24:29,544
I can imagine how much relief
this causes you.

264
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:32,281
I'm sure you've been
thinking about him.

265
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:38,154
I... have been
thinking about him.

266
00:24:55,973 --> 00:24:59,306
They, uh, told me to bring
lots of options.

267
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:04,180
Hey, cutie.

268
00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:08,282
Think you could help me?

269
00:25:08,284 --> 00:25:09,751
I'm Jade.

270
00:25:09,753 --> 00:25:12,854
They gave me a syringe for
my diabetes, but I dropped it.

271
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:15,557
My hands get shaky
when I get low blood sugar.

272
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,559
It's a little too close
to the light.

273
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:20,664
Do you think you could
pick it up for me?

274
00:25:34,745 --> 00:25:37,846
Wow.

275
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:39,413
Stand up.

276
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:42,519
Let me get a good look at you.

277
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:50,759
You are so tall.

278
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:55,030
Orwell and Barry are so angry
with me that I flipped.

279
00:25:55,032 --> 00:25:57,699
But the truth is

280
00:25:57,701 --> 00:26:01,770
we really can do things
that you can't do.

281
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:04,641
I don't understand.

282
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,988
Hey. Hey. Hey!

283
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:24,659
I'm Ian.

284
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:27,763
- All right?
- I'm Ian.

285
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:30,699
And I'm Mary Reynolds.
We're twins.

286
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:32,634
Do you know
what would have happened

287
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:35,070
if she'd have gotten
to that key, you gobshite?

288
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:36,838
The Horde would have killed ya.

289
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,405
What've you got?

290
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:40,976
You get a little,
get a little hard-on? Daryl.

291
00:26:40,978 --> 00:26:43,377
Just calm down, okay?

292
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:48,116
I'm sorry
for being with the Horde.

293
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:50,118
It's just, it's just...

294
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,754
Oh, do you know,
I am tired of being sorry.

295
00:26:52,756 --> 00:26:54,723
You can call me Norma.

296
00:26:54,725 --> 00:26:56,958
I am sorry about
the whole lying thing.

297
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,094
- Though I'm not lying.
- Bro, just stop talking!

298
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,731
I was so amped!

299
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:05,366
We almost got you, bro!

300
00:27:05,368 --> 00:27:07,469
Trying to keep him here
with this light thing?

301
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:10,674
- That's some buttery shit!
- Stop talking.

302
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:14,442
I'm not
supposed to be in the light.

303
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:16,545
Uh, we need more time.

304
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:18,379
Barry is
speaking to Kevin,

305
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:19,948
trying to get him
near the light.

306
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,585
Is he close enough yet?

307
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:27,989
The only one who can defend us is him!

308
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:29,457
Him!

309
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:47,042
Where is the man
in the rain poncho?

310
00:27:47,044 --> 00:27:50,478
Who is he?

311
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,449
Is he just a regular man?
I need to know.

312
00:27:56,086 --> 00:27:59,487
All right, step away from
the controls now, little duck.

313
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:02,358
That's fine.
Now just walk away.

314
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,968
That's it.

315
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,905
Just tiptoe away.

316
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:20,175
I try to come once every week.

317
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:21,843
Sometimes, I admit,

318
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:24,512
I have neglected a week
here and there.

319
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:28,917
He's changed over the years.

320
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,053
I can tell he's given up.

321
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:35,056
It's hard to see.

322
00:28:35,058 --> 00:28:37,926
He thinks he was a mistake.

323
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:40,495
I'm not saying
he did good things.

324
00:28:40,497 --> 00:28:41,930
He didn't.

325
00:28:41,932 --> 00:28:45,535
Those poor people didn't
deserve to die like that.

326
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,606
But he's trying
to make sense of who he is.

327
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:53,677
Ain't we all doing that?

328
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,713
Yes, ma'am, we are.

329
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:02,517
They keep him heavily sedated.

330
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,053
This is an enormous amount
of sedation.

331
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:06,955
He's too smart for 'em.

332
00:29:06,957 --> 00:29:08,957
When they first
brought him here,

333
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,960
he memorized a blueprint
left out from an electrician

334
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:16,433
and short-circuited the power
to the whole hospital.

335
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:20,537
He's good
thinking through things.

336
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:24,572
He has this notion

337
00:29:24,574 --> 00:29:28,610
that superheroes are
based on people like him,

338
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:32,714
and that other gentleman
I read is here, Mr. Dunn.

339
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:34,716
Would it surprise you to know

340
00:29:34,718 --> 00:29:38,887
there are more and more people
who have this delusion?

341
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:42,624
It is actually
the center of my work.

342
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:45,961
Yes, it would.

343
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:53,070
You don't let them
get you down, Elijah.

344
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:56,573
You hear me?

345
00:29:57,274 --> 00:29:59,274
Stay proud.

346
00:30:07,985 --> 00:30:10,087
Step back
against the wall, please.

347
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:15,083
You're keeping him here
without guards?

348
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:17,819
I have to get out of here
before he gets out.

349
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:21,158
The individual
who came with you is contained.

350
00:31:22,993 --> 00:31:24,959
David.

351
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:28,963
I would like you to agree
to have an MRI.

352
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:31,332
You were the sole survivor of
a devastating train derailment

353
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:32,801
19 years ago.

354
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,969
It is possible that there was

355
00:31:34,971 --> 00:31:37,774
damage to the frontal lobe
that you are unaware of.

356
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:56,057
Look at you, David.

357
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:59,060
You believe you have barely
enough strength to stand up.

358
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:01,898
You can't possibly
explain everything away.

359
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:11,739
Madam, I am Mr. Pritchard.

360
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:13,875
I'm a professor of cinema.

361
00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:16,711
Specifically, Japanese,
1950s through the 1980s.

362
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:19,747
And I have absolutely no idea
what I'm doing here.

363
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:21,883
I am very much in favor
of Kevin's reemergence,

364
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:24,886
and yet I find myself
in a goddamn prison cell!

365
00:32:24,888 --> 00:32:27,021
And I can assure you
I am not...

366
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:32,994
Okay.

367
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:56,184
I'm ready.

368
00:32:57,488 --> 00:33:00,822
Young man, wait!

369
00:33:00,824 --> 00:33:03,425
You will not be able
to get to the light.

370
00:33:03,427 --> 00:33:06,027
It is set off by distance

371
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:08,329
as well as being monitored
by a camera.

372
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:11,467
I know this seems
very unfair to you...

373
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:14,869
...but you are stuck
in this room.

374
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:17,372
The guy The Beast fought,
he's right there!

375
00:33:17,374 --> 00:33:20,375
He can't beat The Beast.

376
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:23,945
He doesn't think he can
beat The Beast, does he? Huh?

377
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:25,346
Beast like...

378
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:34,088
He doesn't think he can
beat The Beast, does he?

379
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,058
Beast like...

380
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,895
Your name is Hedwig, right?

381
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:43,331
You're nine, right?

382
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,166
Yeah.

383
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:47,001
Forever?

384
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:52,242
No matter how many
experiences you have?

385
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:57,847
That must be so hard.

386
00:33:59,983 --> 00:34:01,382
You treat people who think

387
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:03,853
they're comic book characters
or something?

388
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:12,260
I got to go.

389
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:15,131
Miss Patricia says
she wants the light.

390
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,877
Hello, Patricia.

391
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:33,047
- I'm Dr. Staple.
- I've gathered.

392
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:38,019
As I understand it, you're
kind of the high priestess.

393
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:41,389
This cause isn't about me.

394
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:43,492
It's about The Beast, is it?

395
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:45,093
Where is he?

396
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:47,831
- Who?
- The man.

397
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:51,899
He is guarded, isn't he?

398
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:53,803
He can't get out?

399
00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:07,282
He's well-intentioned
and you would love him.

400
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:10,985
He's, like, a huge,
he's a big trickster.

401
00:35:10,987 --> 00:35:13,087
He's a, he's a,
he's a great guy.

402
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:14,623
He's got
a great sense of humor.

403
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:18,627
- So, let me recap what you've told me.
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:35:18,629 --> 00:35:22,464
Your dad is not the Green Guard
or "whatever his name is."

405
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:26,334
Your dad is a trickster,
and that I would love him.

406
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,471
He thought it would be fun
to be a do-gooder for a day,

407
00:35:29,473 --> 00:35:31,005
pretend he was this guy.

408
00:35:31,007 --> 00:35:33,107
And with regard
to how he found the girls,

409
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:35,276
you retold a humorous story
where your dad thought

410
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:37,446
the killer might be
in the factory area

411
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:40,616
because his friend Lou...
you referred to him as Louie

412
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:43,217
at a different point...
got mugged down there once.

413
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:45,219
Then your father was
walking by a building,

414
00:35:45,221 --> 00:35:50,091
hears girls screaming for help,
at which point you spiritedly

415
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:52,461
reenacted this moment
in the story.

416
00:35:52,463 --> 00:35:53,928
Thank you for that.

417
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,098
Then your father
called you on the cell.

418
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,400
You told him to call
the police, but he was,

419
00:35:59,402 --> 00:36:01,903
"In it, you know. In it."

420
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:03,304
Right.

421
00:36:03,306 --> 00:36:06,040
I'll sign that
in front of a judge.

422
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:08,144
So, you see,
he shouldn't be here.

423
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:13,016
How long have you believed
your dad was a superhero?

424
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:16,984
There was a microphone
on his poncho.

425
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:19,253
I assume he was communicating
with you.

426
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:22,524
He talks to you
when he's out on searches,

427
00:36:22,526 --> 00:36:24,058
doesn't he, Joseph?

428
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,160
He hasn't hurt anybody.

429
00:36:26,162 --> 00:36:29,631
In the eyes of the authorities,
that is not accurate.

430
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:31,232
He's injured
countless individuals

431
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:33,502
who haven't had
their due process in court.

432
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:36,070
And there was a teenage girl
in this latest incident

433
00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:37,639
- who broke her arm and ribs.
- No.

434
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:39,040
They would all be
murder victims

435
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:40,476
if it wasn't for my dad.

436
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:43,311
It was a vigilante event,
and a victim was injured.

437
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:46,214
They will claim, in court, that
if they had found the girls,

438
00:36:46,216 --> 00:36:49,651
no one would have been hurt.

439
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:52,654
Joseph, I only have a few days.

440
00:36:52,656 --> 00:36:55,691
If I don't get him to give up
his delusion, he will remain

441
00:36:55,693 --> 00:37:00,094
in institutions like this
for the rest of his life.

442
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:02,096
No, he can't stay here.

443
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:05,501
Can I ask you about
your mother, Joseph?

444
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:07,636
What does that
have to do with this?

445
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:11,707
She passed away from
acute lymphoblastic leukemia

446
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:13,742
five years ago.

447
00:37:16,112 --> 00:37:20,516
That was cataclysmic
for you and your dad.

448
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:23,284
Yeah.

449
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:26,120
On the surface, Joseph,
you can see

450
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:29,090
what I'm going to say, right?

451
00:37:29,092 --> 00:37:31,225
You lost your mother.

452
00:37:31,227 --> 00:37:34,262
You believe your father
is a real-life superhero.

453
00:37:34,264 --> 00:37:36,665
You believe
he is almost immortal.

454
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:41,171
You can see how some would say
you need this to be true.

455
00:37:43,072 --> 00:37:44,473
You just have to make sure

456
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:47,776
you are not
more into this than he is.

457
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:11,199
I'm not scared.

458
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:13,134
That's great.

459
00:38:13,136 --> 00:38:15,238
You know why?

460
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,374
I know now.

461
00:38:20,376 --> 00:38:22,045
Know what?

462
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:27,516
Your secret identity.

463
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:30,220
That man was right.

464
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:38,394
Joseph.

465
00:38:40,263 --> 00:38:42,564
There are big guys
in almost every gym

466
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:44,165
that can lift that much.

467
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:47,403
You could've lifted more.

468
00:38:49,473 --> 00:38:51,272
Don't worry.

469
00:38:51,274 --> 00:38:54,143
I won't tell anyone.

470
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:35,249
<i>Just because he let you go</i>

471
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:37,486
<i>doesn't mean he is good.</i>

472
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:40,455
He's being held here
before his trial.

473
00:39:40,457 --> 00:39:42,524
I'm in charge of him for now,

474
00:39:42,526 --> 00:39:47,096
but everyone in this state
wants him tried and put away.

475
00:39:48,832 --> 00:39:50,599
I'm trying to get the others

476
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:55,136
to stop thinking of this
as a superhuman being.

477
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:57,405
If they do,
they will do the right thing

478
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:59,677
and keep him from the light.

479
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:05,482
Can I talk with them?

480
00:40:07,551 --> 00:40:10,086
No.

481
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:12,754
Why?

482
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:14,692
Because it's not...

483
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:20,698
You're the victim.

484
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:50,926
No way!

485
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:54,362
You tried so hard
to get away from us

486
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,364
and now you come back
and see us?

487
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:58,900
You are so weird.

488
00:40:58,902 --> 00:41:00,736
I like Drake now.

489
00:41:00,738 --> 00:41:03,905
I liked Nicki for a while, but
then Nicki and Drake broke up,

490
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:06,374
and you can't like both.

491
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:08,275
This place is
for people who think

492
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:10,244
that they're
comic book characters.

493
00:41:10,246 --> 00:41:11,580
And the Horde is kind of like

494
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:13,749
a comic book character name,
isn't it?

495
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:21,590
Love comic books.

496
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:25,961
I'm sorry for trying to feed
you to The Beast, et cetera.

497
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:29,698
It's okay.

498
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,233
Can I talk to Dennis
or Patricia, please?

499
00:41:32,235 --> 00:41:34,770
She was my girlfriend.

500
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:36,672
We kissed.

501
00:41:38,307 --> 00:41:40,709
Don't worry.
I haven't cheated on you.

502
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:49,453
What are you doing here?

503
00:41:52,321 --> 00:41:54,623
Your clothes are not dirty.

504
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,858
Good.

505
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,295
Hello, Dennis.

506
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:03,865
A lot of people have died.

507
00:42:03,867 --> 00:42:07,334
Well...

508
00:42:07,336 --> 00:42:11,372
You have to give up the light.

509
00:42:11,374 --> 00:42:13,374
They're never gonna
let you out of here.

510
00:42:13,376 --> 00:42:16,480
The Horde has to
give up the light.

511
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:21,817
Listen to this doctor.

512
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:25,620
The doc tells lies.

513
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:29,356
We will reveal that the broken
are the strongest.

514
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,392
The Beast will start
a revolution.

515
00:42:31,394 --> 00:42:33,028
Is that what Patricia
told you to say?

516
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,765
The Beast is the highest form
of human evolution.

517
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:39,534
Dennis. You guys are gonna die.

518
00:42:39,536 --> 00:42:41,370
Casey.

519
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:46,007
Ah... oh...

520
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:47,976
Oh, sh...

521
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:03,392
Hey.

522
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:07,729
Kevin?

523
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:09,666
It's you.

524
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:22,409
You look different.

525
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:25,881
I wanted to tell you something.

526
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:29,017
My uncle's in jail.

527
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:31,320
I put him there.

528
00:43:33,422 --> 00:43:38,460
What he did to me was... wrong.

529
00:43:38,462 --> 00:43:42,497
Just like what your mom
did to you was wrong.

530
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:45,736
We're the same?

531
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,744
I'm sorry.

532
00:43:55,746 --> 00:43:57,612
- I can't. I got...
- Kevin, wait.

533
00:43:57,614 --> 00:44:00,916
I've got to go.
I've got to go.

534
00:44:00,918 --> 00:44:05,720
The Horde is never
letting go of the light and...

535
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,461
Do you like Kevin now?

536
00:44:13,463 --> 00:44:16,598
Casey. I need you.

537
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,568
The power of true,
loving, physical affection,

538
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,636
it's like something
supernatural.

539
00:44:21,638 --> 00:44:23,772
It's the lack of it
that caused this,

540
00:44:23,774 --> 00:44:26,541
and only the true version of it
can heal it.

541
00:44:26,543 --> 00:44:27,911
Will you help me?

542
00:44:56,139 --> 00:44:59,910
<i>You are the last
person I need to see today.</i>

543
00:45:01,144 --> 00:45:03,745
You see this camera?

544
00:45:03,747 --> 00:45:06,948
There are 100 more of these.

545
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,050
Out of respect for
your cognitive abilities,

546
00:45:09,052 --> 00:45:12,787
I have installed cameras
on every floor, every area,

547
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:15,624
including every direction
of the exterior building.

548
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:17,659
We will see everything.

549
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:21,529
There is nowhere you can go
that won't be documented.

550
00:45:21,531 --> 00:45:24,933
Elijah. I've come
to the conclusion

551
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:28,603
that we should perform
a procedure on you.

552
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:31,673
This is a corrective procedure
that rebalances

553
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:35,243
the part of the frontal lobe
that is overstimulated.

554
00:45:35,245 --> 00:45:39,047
It would be an honor to get to
know your perspicacious mind.

555
00:45:39,049 --> 00:45:43,520
We're going to conduct
the procedure in three days.

556
00:45:57,634 --> 00:46:00,135
12!

557
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:03,705
Keep going!

558
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:11,713
Right there, right there!

559
00:46:35,272 --> 00:46:38,640
Hey, my man.

560
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:40,809
How'd you get out of your room?

561
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:43,078
You must have
left the door ajar.

562
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,080
He rolled out toward the noise.

563
00:46:45,082 --> 00:46:48,149
Wheel him back in
before the doctor sees.

564
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:50,318
Oh, you're too nice, Daryl.

565
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,020
You got to be firm.

566
00:46:52,022 --> 00:46:54,990
They'll walk all over you
otherwise.

567
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:58,226
He didn't touch
any of the medicines, did he?

568
00:46:58,228 --> 00:47:00,895
No.

569
00:47:00,897 --> 00:47:02,866
Right amounts.

570
00:47:30,227 --> 00:47:33,194
<i>This will be
my final evaluation.</i>

571
00:47:41,872 --> 00:47:45,006
You got to be kidding me.

572
00:47:45,008 --> 00:47:47,776
This guy killed everyone
on my train.

573
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:50,747
He's a mass murderer.

574
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:05,126
I understand
that the three of you

575
00:48:05,128 --> 00:48:07,695
think you are superhuman.

576
00:48:07,697 --> 00:48:09,864
That you don't think
you are normal.

577
00:48:09,866 --> 00:48:14,135
You've convinced yourselves
you have extraordinary gifts,

578
00:48:14,137 --> 00:48:17,705
like something
out of a comic book.

579
00:48:17,707 --> 00:48:20,341
I am here to discuss
the possibility

580
00:48:20,343 --> 00:48:23,111
that you are mistaken.

581
00:48:23,113 --> 00:48:26,583
Can you tell me about
Kevin's parents?

582
00:48:30,253 --> 00:48:33,354
Kevin's mother...

583
00:48:33,356 --> 00:48:35,924
hurt Kevin.

584
00:48:35,926 --> 00:48:40,128
And Kevin's father
was gonna get a doctor

585
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:44,067
to try and stop her,
but he left.

586
00:48:48,405 --> 00:48:50,874
I never wanted any of this.

587
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,676
What?

588
00:48:54,678 --> 00:48:56,179
The killings.

589
00:49:14,397 --> 00:49:16,164
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

590
00:49:18,436 --> 00:49:22,203
- Kevin Wendell Crumb.
- Kevin Wendell Crumb!

591
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:25,940
What did I tell you?!

592
00:49:25,942 --> 00:49:28,009
There is no running
in the house,

593
00:49:28,011 --> 00:49:30,211
Kevin Wendell Crumb!

594
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:34,048
Kevin?

595
00:49:36,386 --> 00:49:38,353
Kevin.

596
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:40,922
Why do you all
keep bringing me back?

597
00:49:40,924 --> 00:49:42,891
I-I don't want to be here.

598
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:46,127
The need for the particular
story we tell ourselves

599
00:49:46,129 --> 00:49:47,496
begins somewhere, Kevin.

600
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:49,498
From a memory.

601
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,434
What?

602
00:49:52,436 --> 00:49:53,902
I don't...

603
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:57,138
Hey, where's that girl?

604
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,240
Casey. Sh-She...

605
00:50:01,945 --> 00:50:04,078
Everybody wants the light now.

606
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,080
They're all fighting,
et cetera.

607
00:50:06,082 --> 00:50:07,882
And Miss Patricia's
yelling at me,

608
00:50:07,884 --> 00:50:09,518
saying I got to hold on
to the light.

609
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,321
She said I have one job to do:
keep Kevin out of the light.

610
00:50:13,323 --> 00:50:15,491
So, I'm sorry,
you won't see him anymore.

611
00:50:17,495 --> 00:50:20,795
And you have to listen
to her, right?

612
00:50:20,797 --> 00:50:23,231
Because she's an adult
and you're not.

613
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:26,334
Duh. Yeah.

614
00:50:26,336 --> 00:50:28,102
Is he crying?

615
00:50:28,104 --> 00:50:30,104
Geez, pussy.

616
00:50:30,106 --> 00:50:33,274
Listen, I don't know about
these other guys,

617
00:50:33,276 --> 00:50:34,976
but we are like a superhero.

618
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:37,446
No? We're like...

619
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:39,282
We're not crazy!

620
00:50:41,184 --> 00:50:46,321
David, I don't think
this applies just to Kevin

621
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:48,490
and his disorder.

622
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:50,526
Is there a memory?

623
00:50:50,528 --> 00:50:52,860
What you're looking for

624
00:50:52,862 --> 00:50:55,129
is a moment of weakness
that made you

625
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:59,167
possibly entertain the idea
of being super strong.

626
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:34,170
There is a reason I ask you.

627
00:51:37,475 --> 00:51:39,776
This is your MRI, David.

628
00:51:44,347 --> 00:51:47,415
This is your frontal lobe.

629
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:51,352
There is a questionable cloud
right here.

630
00:51:51,354 --> 00:51:53,955
There is the possibility

631
00:51:53,957 --> 00:51:56,858
that that is damage
from that train accident.

632
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,330
I'm supposed to believe
this means something?

633
00:52:05,335 --> 00:52:08,303
It's just this,
plus an anchoring incident,

634
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:12,474
and you would have the pattern
for this disorder that I treat.

635
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:26,954
I hate to see you like this.

636
00:52:26,956 --> 00:52:29,023
This is not
how I would've done things.

637
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:33,094
I don't approve of
how they've handled you.

638
00:52:33,096 --> 00:52:35,096
Elijah, because of
your condition,

639
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:37,466
I didn't have to do
an MRI on you.

640
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:39,635
There are a few in your file.

641
00:52:39,637 --> 00:52:41,637
You definitely have
one of the markers

642
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:43,505
for this disorder, Elijah.

643
00:52:43,507 --> 00:52:45,208
As do you, Kevin.

644
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,310
These are the medical reasons

645
00:52:49,312 --> 00:52:52,080
I'm thinking
you have this disorder.

646
00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:55,016
Now let's deal with
why you think you don't.

647
00:52:55,018 --> 00:53:00,922
How do you know who's good
and who's bad, David?

648
00:53:00,924 --> 00:53:03,026
Convince me.

649
00:53:05,995 --> 00:53:08,262
It's a feeling.

650
00:53:08,264 --> 00:53:09,698
An intuition?

651
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,668
When you see someone?

652
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:14,603
I have to touch them.

653
00:53:14,605 --> 00:53:17,475
What does the intuition
feel like?

654
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:22,444
A vision.

655
00:53:22,446 --> 00:53:24,613
A moment.

656
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:27,081
A sin.

657
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:30,351
You kind of
have to interpret it.

658
00:53:30,353 --> 00:53:33,020
Have you ever seen
very good magicians, David?

659
00:53:33,022 --> 00:53:36,290
I mean, the very best.

660
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:38,192
They are trained as mentalists,

661
00:53:38,194 --> 00:53:41,630
and they can do
seemingly extraordinary feats.

662
00:53:41,632 --> 00:53:44,566
They accomplish these feats by
interpreting hundreds of cues

663
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:48,437
that an individual is
giving off in a split second.

664
00:53:48,439 --> 00:53:53,341
I think you are like these
professional guessers, David.

665
00:53:53,343 --> 00:53:58,312
You are world-class at it,
simply extraordinary at it.

666
00:53:58,314 --> 00:54:03,752
But it is based on real things,
and you are making the picture.

667
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:07,257
It is not coming to you
through mystical means.

668
00:54:14,465 --> 00:54:16,632
These are the clothes
that the patient next to you

669
00:54:16,634 --> 00:54:18,467
came in with when he arrived.

670
00:54:18,469 --> 00:54:21,603
There's red clay
staining the pants.

671
00:54:21,605 --> 00:54:24,205
It's very visible.

672
00:54:27,511 --> 00:54:31,513
Is it possible that you saw
something on the news...

673
00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:34,583
- Sorry, bro.
- <i>...then saw an adult acting like a child,</i>

674
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:38,620
someone who fit the bill
of someone with this disorder,

675
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:42,023
intuited, "This might be
the person I'm looking for"?

676
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:43,224
Saw the red clay

677
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:48,597
and thought he might be hiding
in a place with red clay?

678
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,599
No.

679
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:53,236
You're certain?

680
00:54:54,805 --> 00:54:59,275
You're... creating a chain of
thoughts that never happened.

681
00:55:07,116 --> 00:55:10,384
You really dissected him,
Doctor.

682
00:55:10,386 --> 00:55:12,754
Good for you.

683
00:55:12,756 --> 00:55:15,591
As I understand it,
there were many videos

684
00:55:15,593 --> 00:55:17,426
of world-class rock climbers

685
00:55:17,428 --> 00:55:20,194
on the computer
in your office at the zoo.

686
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:22,531
It was kind of an obsession.

687
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:24,466
Some of those climbers

688
00:55:24,468 --> 00:55:27,836
could actually scale
a literal wall, couldn't they?

689
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:31,707
What's your point, Doctor?

690
00:55:31,709 --> 00:55:33,274
It was a practical observation

691
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:36,545
that produced a practical
skill set in an alter.

692
00:55:36,547 --> 00:55:39,748
Mm.

693
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,551
Then how did he bend the bars?

694
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:45,253
The iron bars at the zoo?

695
00:55:45,255 --> 00:55:49,223
You did see those, didn't you?

696
00:55:49,225 --> 00:55:50,792
That's not in our heads.

697
00:55:50,794 --> 00:55:52,393
The cages beneath the zoo

698
00:55:52,395 --> 00:55:55,564
were made in 1874
when the zoo first opened.

699
00:55:55,566 --> 00:55:59,267
I was able to bend them by
putting a wrench between them

700
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:00,401
and leaning back.

701
00:56:00,403 --> 00:56:04,540
Difficult, again, but possible.

702
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:06,508
No.

703
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,309
What about the shotgun?

704
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:10,445
He was shot.
Not once but twice.

705
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:12,447
What does your sleeping mind
think of that?

706
00:56:12,449 --> 00:56:14,783
We've analyzed the shotgun
and the cartridges.

707
00:56:14,785 --> 00:56:16,384
They were very old.

708
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:19,454
There was a lot of moisture
from the boiler room

709
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:22,223
down in the locker area
where they were kept.

710
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:24,726
The cartridges were
possibly compromised.

711
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:28,229
And some of the pellets
hit the inside of the bars.

712
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:32,534
It is at least possible

713
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:35,472
that there is a practical
explanation for this.

714
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:44,615
What if I suggested
something upsetting, Patricia?

715
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:50,786
Like The Beast isn't
as powerful as you think.

716
00:56:50,788 --> 00:56:55,490
He's not much more powerful
than a strong man.

717
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:59,195
The facts you are basing
your belief in are wrong.

718
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:06,637
If superheroes exist, why are
there only three of you?

719
00:57:13,744 --> 00:57:16,410
<i>When was the first
comic book written?</i>

720
00:57:16,412 --> 00:57:20,749
The first reprints of newspaper
strips in tabloid size

721
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:22,684
happened in 1929.

722
00:57:22,686 --> 00:57:27,522
And then, in 1938,
the apotheosis happened.

723
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:29,791
Action Comics Number One
launched

724
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:33,394
with the man in the cape and
the blue tights on the cover.

725
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:34,362
Boo-yah!

726
00:57:34,364 --> 00:57:36,397
Here we are.

727
00:57:43,507 --> 00:57:45,442
Thank you.

728
00:57:50,279 --> 00:57:52,748
What are you doing back there?

729
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,349
You're not one of those
Hello Kitty pervs?

730
00:57:55,351 --> 00:57:57,721
I'm just looking for something.

731
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:02,557
Prove to someone I'm not crazy.

732
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,528
I'm leaving.

733
00:59:12,463 --> 00:59:14,330
Oh, my God.

734
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,557
- Catch.
- You're it.

735
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:26,637
- Let's play hot potato, guys.
- Let's play hot potato!

736
01:00:28,404 --> 01:00:31,940
Hot potato. Hot potato.

737
01:00:31,942 --> 01:00:33,975
<i>Hot potato. Hot potato.</i>

738
01:00:33,977 --> 01:00:35,710
Hot potato.
Hot potato. Hot potato.

739
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:37,546
Hot potato! Hot potato! Hot!

740
01:00:37,548 --> 01:00:38,980
- You're out.
- You're out.

741
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:39,981
Come on, ready?

742
01:00:39,983 --> 01:00:42,486
<i>- No!
- No!</i>

743
01:00:44,054 --> 01:00:49,691
Hot potato.
Hot potato. Hot potato.

744
01:00:49,693 --> 01:00:51,493
Hot potato.
Hot potato. Hot potato.

745
01:00:51,495 --> 01:00:53,028
Hot potato! Hot!

746
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,664
I'm just asking you to bring in
a package if you see one

747
01:00:55,666 --> 01:00:58,635
instead of stepping over it
to come in the house.

748
01:01:07,744 --> 01:01:09,680
Hello?

749
01:01:51,188 --> 01:01:55,190
If, by mistake,
I-I drop this...

750
01:01:55,192 --> 01:01:58,629
heavy flashlight
on your paper legs...

751
01:02:00,998 --> 01:02:03,632
...no one would come
check on you for some time,

752
01:02:03,634 --> 01:02:06,703
not until Daryl gets here
for his shift.

753
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:15,879
Have you been getting
out of your room, Elijah?

754
01:02:43,507 --> 01:02:46,610
I must be losing my mind.

755
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:14,703
Night, Joe.

756
01:03:14,705 --> 01:03:16,807
Have a good night.

757
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:24,145
- Daryl.
- Hey, my man.

758
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:25,747
You almost made it.

759
01:03:25,749 --> 01:03:29,017
I think your watch is fast.

760
01:03:29,019 --> 01:03:30,285
Joe, my man.

761
01:03:30,287 --> 01:03:31,786
- How's it going?
- What's going on?

762
01:03:31,788 --> 01:03:33,221
- What's happening?
- Looking tired, man.

763
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:34,589
You still taking
that multivitamin?

764
01:03:34,591 --> 01:03:35,523
Not like I should.

765
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:37,625
Yeah, but, listen,
you got to take the D.

766
01:03:37,627 --> 01:03:38,693
If you don't take vitamin D,

767
01:03:38,695 --> 01:03:40,895
none of that stuff's gonna
absorb into your body.

768
01:04:56,306 --> 01:04:59,307
Clarence Wendell Crumb.

769
01:05:19,863 --> 01:05:21,430
Take a little bit
of grape seed extract,

770
01:05:21,432 --> 01:05:22,864
and it'll keep it all in there.

771
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:24,732
You'll absorb it
into your body faster.

772
01:05:24,734 --> 01:05:26,435
Let me ask you,
how much water you drinking?

773
01:05:26,437 --> 01:05:29,737
- Not enough.
- Yeah. I know.

774
01:05:55,699 --> 01:05:57,165
How?

775
01:05:57,167 --> 01:06:01,870
How did you get here
without anyone seeing?

776
01:06:01,872 --> 01:06:04,038
The sound of
a car backfiring occurs

777
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,308
when unburned fuel vapor is
ignited by a very hot muffler

778
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,244
upon the car being turned off.

779
01:06:09,246 --> 01:06:11,246
Daryl, who takes over
at 11:00 p.m.,

780
01:06:11,248 --> 01:06:13,781
suffers from this particular
vehicular malady.

781
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:16,718
It happened seven minutes ago.

782
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,887
Couple that with the fact
that I've overheard complaints

783
01:06:18,889 --> 01:06:21,055
about how long it takes him
to get to his desk...

784
01:06:21,057 --> 01:06:23,091
he's a bit of a talker,
you see...

785
01:06:23,093 --> 01:06:25,994
I estimate I have
two to three minutes left.

786
01:06:25,996 --> 01:06:29,465
Someone has been pretending.

787
01:06:29,467 --> 01:06:30,932
Pilfered the aspirin bottle.

788
01:06:30,934 --> 01:06:33,768
Replaced the original dose
of medicine

789
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:35,471
with the same amount
of aspirin.

790
01:06:35,473 --> 01:06:36,938
Did sleight of hand
with the pills

791
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,407
given to me to take daily.

792
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:41,743
What do you want?

793
01:06:41,745 --> 01:06:43,811
Ma'am.

794
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:46,114
I'm here to see

795
01:06:46,116 --> 01:06:48,950
if the tales of the
extraordinary being are real,

796
01:06:48,952 --> 01:06:51,953
- the half-man, half-creature.
- Patricia.

797
01:06:51,955 --> 01:06:54,691
But I appreciate your manners.

798
01:06:57,928 --> 01:07:00,061
I don't know anymore.

799
01:07:00,063 --> 01:07:01,963
I'm a comic book expert,
Patricia.

800
01:07:01,965 --> 01:07:04,799
I believe comic books are
a continuation of documentation

801
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:08,903
that has gone on for centuries
of what humans are capable of.

802
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:14,108
That they are what someone
somewhere saw or felt.

803
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,778
Are you aware that spandex,
the underwear on the outside,

804
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:21,382
and boots come from strongmen
in the circus in the 1930s?

805
01:07:21,384 --> 01:07:22,984
- No.
- The freak show men

806
01:07:22,986 --> 01:07:25,253
who could do
incredible feats of strength.

807
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:29,525
I urge you to look past the
capes and monologuing villains.

808
01:07:29,527 --> 01:07:31,259
Are you with me?

809
01:07:31,261 --> 01:07:33,462
Yes.

810
01:07:33,464 --> 01:07:35,230
I only have a minute left.

811
01:07:35,232 --> 01:07:37,865
I believe The Beast
may be part of this.

812
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:40,368
There are references
to man/animal characters.

813
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:44,138
The dual character, the man
who has abilities like animals.

814
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:47,141
I'd like to meet The Beast,
see if he's real.

815
01:07:47,143 --> 01:07:49,410
If he is,

816
01:07:49,412 --> 01:07:53,281
then I'll get us all
out of here tomorrow night.

817
01:07:57,455 --> 01:08:00,088
What's upsetting you, Patricia?

818
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:02,892
What if he can't do
these extraordinary things?

819
01:08:05,596 --> 01:08:09,297
What if he is just unwell?

820
01:08:09,299 --> 01:08:11,001
Like you.

821
01:08:12,902 --> 01:08:17,606
Everything extraordinary
can be explained away,

822
01:08:17,608 --> 01:08:21,309
and yet it is true.

823
01:08:21,311 --> 01:08:23,445
I think deep down
you know this.

824
01:08:23,447 --> 01:08:27,982
Everything we will see and do
will have a basis in science.

825
01:08:27,984 --> 01:08:29,984
But it will have limits.

826
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:32,920
This is the real world,
not a cartoon.

827
01:08:32,922 --> 01:08:37,925
And yet some of us
don't die from bullets.

828
01:08:37,927 --> 01:08:42,330
Some of us
can still bend steel.

829
01:08:42,332 --> 01:08:46,267
That is not a fantasy.

830
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:49,103
Hmm.

831
01:08:49,105 --> 01:08:52,541
If you really think
you can get us all out,

832
01:08:52,543 --> 01:08:55,611
then you may meet The Beast.

833
01:08:55,613 --> 01:08:59,316
But for your sake,
I hope he likes you.

834
01:09:01,251 --> 01:09:03,951
Tomorrow night.

835
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:06,856
Call a board meeting
or whatever.

836
01:09:12,062 --> 01:09:14,931
What do we call you, sir?

837
01:09:17,635 --> 01:09:22,839
First name, "Mr."
Last name, "Glass."

838
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:34,115
- What's going on?
- Be careful.

839
01:09:34,117 --> 01:09:35,983
- What... Oh.
- Not too much pressure when restraining him.

840
01:09:35,985 --> 01:09:37,118
Dr. Staple, what are you doing?

841
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,252
- It's a sedative.
- What?

842
01:09:38,254 --> 01:09:39,655
- I'm sorry to do this, Elijah.
- Ow!

843
01:09:39,657 --> 01:09:41,989
We saw footage of you
leaving your room last night.

844
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:43,391
- No. No.
- It seems you have been duping us.

845
01:09:43,393 --> 01:09:45,393
I've moved up the procedure
to this morning.

846
01:09:45,395 --> 01:09:46,495
Wait, I...

847
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:06,414
Thank you
for being careful, everyone.

848
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:08,151
Good luck, Elijah.

849
01:10:09,487 --> 01:10:11,687
Nothing essential
is going to change

850
01:10:11,689 --> 01:10:13,655
about who you are.

851
01:10:13,657 --> 01:10:15,959
I promise, my friend.

852
01:10:31,141 --> 01:10:33,141
Elijah!

853
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,401
Elijah!

854
01:11:02,573 --> 01:11:04,506
So let's all scream!

855
01:11:19,088 --> 01:11:21,590
Elijah!

856
01:11:21,592 --> 01:11:23,559
Ma'am, get ahold of yourself.

857
01:11:24,728 --> 01:11:27,429
Mama!

858
01:11:33,504 --> 01:11:35,303
Elijah!

859
01:11:35,305 --> 01:11:37,205
Stop the ride!

860
01:11:37,207 --> 01:11:39,373
- Ma'am, step down.
- Stop the ride!

861
01:12:21,552 --> 01:12:24,285
Dinner, Elijah.

862
01:12:25,623 --> 01:12:27,321
How you doing?

863
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:31,660
You'll feel better tomorrow.

864
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:38,201
Pictures are crooked.

865
01:12:50,313 --> 01:12:52,814
Hey.

866
01:12:56,386 --> 01:13:00,323
Took a bitch-ass long time
to find the right piece.

867
01:13:19,175 --> 01:13:22,711
<i>First name, "Mr."</i>

868
01:13:22,713 --> 01:13:26,882
Last name, "Glass."

869
01:14:20,403 --> 01:14:22,537
You don't know
what it's like, Daryl.

870
01:14:22,539 --> 01:14:26,808
To be so different,
you don't know where you fit.

871
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:29,511
It's an awful feeling.

872
01:14:41,424 --> 01:14:43,391
Hey there, buddy. What's up?

873
01:14:43,393 --> 01:14:44,826
Patricia told us
you were coming.

874
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:48,295
My name is Luke, and I am
Team Horde all the way.

875
01:14:48,297 --> 01:14:50,398
Yeah, I can intro you
to everybody.

876
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,434
I ain't no bad hombre to know.

877
01:14:52,436 --> 01:14:54,603
Everybody's gonna tell you
that I got a big mouth, though,

878
01:14:54,605 --> 01:14:56,905
I spoil
the end of movies. Ain't true.

879
01:14:56,907 --> 01:14:59,775
Everybody knows the priest dies
at the end of <i>The Exorcist.</i>

880
01:15:02,278 --> 01:15:04,579
The American Sublime.

881
01:15:04,581 --> 01:15:08,583
Do you even know
what that means? No.

882
01:15:08,585 --> 01:15:11,720
That is why
this world is a lost cause.

883
01:15:11,722 --> 01:15:13,555
That is why The Beast is

884
01:15:13,557 --> 01:15:15,691
the only thing that is
pure and meaningful...

885
01:15:15,693 --> 01:15:18,694
American Sublime refers to
Western paintings of landscapes

886
01:15:18,696 --> 01:15:21,463
and seascapes depicting
the immensity of nature.

887
01:15:21,465 --> 01:15:23,465
The use of violent storms
in the distance

888
01:15:23,467 --> 01:15:25,667
was a common practice.

889
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:28,302
Painting's of particular
interest to me.

890
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:34,543
Hey, Miss Patricia says
that your bones can break

891
01:15:34,545 --> 01:15:36,611
if I, like,
tap them.

892
01:15:36,613 --> 01:15:37,813
Is that true?

893
01:15:37,815 --> 01:15:39,346
Yes.

894
01:15:39,348 --> 01:15:41,348
Uh, so what's your superpower?

895
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,487
Your-your mind?

896
01:15:44,788 --> 01:15:46,757
What's mine?

897
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,961
You're nine forever, right?

898
01:15:52,963 --> 01:15:54,963
Yeah.

899
01:15:54,965 --> 01:15:57,466
That's incredible.

900
01:15:57,468 --> 01:16:00,635
You can see the world
the way it really is.

901
01:16:00,637 --> 01:16:02,537
Always.

902
01:16:02,539 --> 01:16:05,006
Kid who can never grow old.

903
01:16:07,644 --> 01:16:09,345
Are you ready?

904
01:16:11,782 --> 01:16:15,784
Are you ready?

905
01:16:15,786 --> 01:16:17,919
Yeah.

906
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:19,857
Whoa.

907
01:16:22,893 --> 01:16:26,061
This place is so cool,
Mr. Glass.

908
01:16:26,063 --> 01:16:29,363
I feel like dancing.

909
01:16:29,365 --> 01:16:31,365
Then go ahead and dance.

910
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:33,435
Yeah! Check it!

911
01:16:39,476 --> 01:16:41,277
Yeah.

912
01:16:48,919 --> 01:16:51,420
Oh, man.

913
01:17:40,804 --> 01:17:44,539
They've been lying to us all.

914
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:48,377
You believe?

915
01:17:49,112 --> 01:17:51,882
Yes, I do.

916
01:17:54,451 --> 01:17:57,752
It's what I've believed
my whole life.

917
01:18:00,157 --> 01:18:04,125
They are losing faith.

918
01:18:04,127 --> 01:18:09,764
My Horde is losing faith!

919
01:18:09,766 --> 01:18:12,567
In comics...

920
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:16,905
you would go to a public place
where all could see you.

921
01:18:16,907 --> 01:18:20,742
A place celebrating
man's pedestrian achievements.

922
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:27,616
But you need David
to convince them.

923
01:18:27,618 --> 01:18:30,185
You should fight him

924
01:18:30,187 --> 01:18:32,689
in front of the world.

925
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:38,793
The tallest building
in this city is opening today.

926
01:18:38,795 --> 01:18:45,667
All the cameras in the world
will record you.

927
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:50,805
You can convince the Horde
and the world at the same time.

928
01:18:50,807 --> 01:18:54,075
We exist.

929
01:18:58,248 --> 01:19:04,552
Why are you
in this chair, child?

930
01:19:04,554 --> 01:19:08,623
My bones break easily.

931
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:10,191
I was born this way.

932
01:19:10,193 --> 01:19:14,195
I've had 94 breaks in my life.

933
01:19:14,197 --> 01:19:17,832
I've known only pain.

934
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:20,869
Rejoice.

935
01:19:20,871 --> 01:19:27,142
You have suffered
and are now pure.

936
01:19:27,144 --> 01:19:31,846
I assume you were sent here
to be an avenging angel.

937
01:19:33,684 --> 01:19:36,851
How much do you want
to avenge us?

938
01:19:52,736 --> 01:19:57,841
Well, that sounds like
the bad guys teaming up.

939
01:20:02,012 --> 01:20:04,679
How you doing, David?

940
01:20:04,681 --> 01:20:07,215
I always thought of us
as friends.

941
01:20:07,217 --> 01:20:09,718
Elijah?

942
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,153
You shouldn't be hiding
in the shadows, David.

943
01:20:12,155 --> 01:20:15,023
You're able to hide
because people who steal cars

944
01:20:15,025 --> 01:20:18,860
and mug people in alleys
don't need your full potential.

945
01:20:18,862 --> 01:20:20,762
You're only using
one percent of your abilities

946
01:20:20,764 --> 01:20:22,330
with these petty criminals.

947
01:20:22,332 --> 01:20:25,867
Maybe there's nothing
to hide, Elijah.

948
01:20:25,869 --> 01:20:27,268
I have found someone

949
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:31,172
who will require your
full potential to come out.

950
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:33,775
A superhuman serial killer.

951
01:20:33,777 --> 01:20:37,178
Don't do this.

952
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:39,781
How can we be the only ones?

953
01:20:39,783 --> 01:20:42,951
Maybe we believed something
that isn't even true.

954
01:20:44,054 --> 01:20:48,323
We are going to the
tallest building in the city.

955
01:20:48,325 --> 01:20:51,092
The Horde is going to be
revealed there.

956
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:52,694
There are three floors

957
01:20:52,696 --> 01:20:54,796
that house a chemical company
in that building.

958
01:20:54,798 --> 01:20:56,931
I am going to blow up
that building

959
01:20:56,933 --> 01:20:58,800
using their chemicals, David.

960
01:20:58,802 --> 01:21:02,637
You might want
to try and stop us.

961
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:05,306
Today is your coming-out party.

962
01:21:05,308 --> 01:21:08,143
At least you know what to wear.

963
01:21:14,217 --> 01:21:17,719
I've turned off the water hoses
in your room, David.

964
01:21:17,721 --> 01:21:20,355
- There's only the door left.
- Elijah.

965
01:21:20,357 --> 01:21:21,956
It's metal.

966
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:23,691
But you can't get through it

967
01:21:23,693 --> 01:21:26,227
because people's bones break
against metal,

968
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:28,863
and you're nothing special.

969
01:21:28,865 --> 01:21:34,002
A lot of people are
going to die, Overseer,

970
01:21:34,004 --> 01:21:37,839
if you don't get
through that door.

971
01:21:44,981 --> 01:21:47,084
Hi.

972
01:22:09,072 --> 01:22:10,774
I'm here.

973
01:22:29,427 --> 01:22:31,025
Daryl?

974
01:23:26,816 --> 01:23:29,217
This is where
they would paint you

975
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:34,224
with big eyes and bubbles
of confusion above your head.

976
01:23:43,434 --> 01:23:48,437
You... hurt him?

977
01:23:48,439 --> 01:23:50,371
What are you doing?

978
01:23:50,373 --> 01:23:55,843
You should kneel before him.

979
01:23:55,845 --> 01:23:58,780
He is the broken.

980
01:23:58,782 --> 01:24:01,115
Step away from me.

981
01:24:01,117 --> 01:24:04,252
Get back in your room!
Both of you!

982
01:24:17,033 --> 01:24:20,134
You're fighting for the broken.

983
01:24:21,871 --> 01:24:23,371
You found your purpose.

984
01:24:53,937 --> 01:24:58,006
One of the Horde may need
to walk us out of here,

985
01:24:58,008 --> 01:25:01,378
if that's okay... partner.

986
01:26:09,613 --> 01:26:11,915
Go through the basement.

987
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:08,497
Listen to me, Joseph.

988
01:28:08,499 --> 01:28:10,566
Your father is making
great progress.

989
01:28:10,568 --> 01:28:13,201
I'm very hopeful for him.

990
01:28:13,203 --> 01:28:19,008
Did you know the first Superman
couldn't even fly?

991
01:28:20,376 --> 01:28:23,244
And Metropolis is actually
New York City.

992
01:28:23,246 --> 01:28:24,680
And what about
all the coincidences

993
01:28:24,682 --> 01:28:26,247
in what I was reading?

994
01:28:26,249 --> 01:28:29,052
Comic books are an obsession.

995
01:28:30,286 --> 01:28:34,255
Have you ever been
to a comic book convention?

996
01:28:34,257 --> 01:28:37,493
They sell teen TV shows there.

997
01:28:37,495 --> 01:28:40,496
They are selling things.

998
01:28:40,498 --> 01:28:45,536
Your friends and family members
have lost their perspective.

999
01:28:47,471 --> 01:28:51,138
Your dad is trying
to fight her abductor.

1000
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:54,242
Your son is trying
to best his dad.

1001
01:28:54,244 --> 01:28:56,478
He's the anarchist.

1002
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,647
He's the brains.
He's the reluctant hero.

1003
01:28:58,649 --> 01:29:02,283
This all sounds very familiar,
doesn't it?

1004
01:29:02,285 --> 01:29:06,287
Comic books are not
valid history.

1005
01:29:15,866 --> 01:29:19,367
Hey, what wing are you with?

1006
01:29:19,369 --> 01:29:22,236
Uh, The Beast
is saying that he'd like you

1007
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:24,441
to roll forward when they come.

1008
01:29:28,177 --> 01:29:30,079
I believe.

1009
01:29:30,814 --> 01:29:32,516
I believe.

1010
01:29:34,585 --> 01:29:36,554
I believe.

1011
01:29:42,392 --> 01:29:44,193
I believe.

1012
01:30:36,379 --> 01:30:39,781
The new Osaka building
opens today with much fanfare.

1013
01:30:39,783 --> 01:30:42,484
Thousands are expected
to come out for the ceremony.

1014
01:30:42,486 --> 01:30:44,753
Many just want to see
the spectacular architecture.

1015
01:30:44,755 --> 01:30:46,788
Now, this building is expected

1016
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:48,924
to be the hub
of the business community,

1017
01:30:48,926 --> 01:30:50,425
creating thousands of jobs...

1018
01:30:50,427 --> 01:30:52,494
We have a Code Three.

1019
01:30:52,496 --> 01:30:54,295
All patients locked
in their rooms.

1020
01:30:54,297 --> 01:30:56,397
Grounds security on alert.

1021
01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:58,199
The patients
are planning to go

1022
01:30:58,201 --> 01:30:59,868
to the public opening
of the Osaka Tower,

1023
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:01,369
the tallest building.

1024
01:31:01,371 --> 01:31:02,871
Elijah may be intending
to compromise

1025
01:31:02,873 --> 01:31:04,506
a chemical facility there.

1026
01:31:04,508 --> 01:31:07,274
Please alert the
Philadelphia Police Department.

1027
01:31:07,276 --> 01:31:10,277
They made a mistake
going through the basement.

1028
01:31:10,279 --> 01:31:12,313
It gives us some time.

1029
01:31:12,315 --> 01:31:14,415
I remember something

1030
01:31:14,417 --> 01:31:16,685
about a classic public forum

1031
01:31:16,687 --> 01:31:19,521
where the climax
of limited editions end.

1032
01:31:19,523 --> 01:31:22,557
Uh, I think he said it was
referred to as the showdown,

1033
01:31:22,559 --> 01:31:24,960
where all the skills
are revealed

1034
01:31:24,962 --> 01:31:28,597
and-and pitted
against each other.

1035
01:31:28,599 --> 01:31:30,467
And then?

1036
01:31:31,835 --> 01:31:33,737
What happens?

1037
01:31:57,828 --> 01:31:59,628
Christ, they're out here.

1038
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:00,929
They're out here!

1039
01:32:15,512 --> 01:32:17,012
This is Dr. Ellie Staple.

1040
01:32:17,014 --> 01:32:18,412
We will need assistance

1041
01:32:18,414 --> 01:32:20,751
at Raven Hill Memorial
immediately.

1042
01:32:41,772 --> 01:32:44,307
No!

1043
01:32:49,345 --> 01:32:51,646
How many people
are gonna die today?

1044
01:32:51,648 --> 01:32:52,914
Huh?

1045
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:54,415
I don't want to do this.

1046
01:32:54,417 --> 01:32:55,917
I don't care
what Patricia says.

1047
01:32:55,919 --> 01:32:57,886
I'm not...

1048
01:32:57,888 --> 01:33:00,655
Hedwig's taking the light.

1049
01:33:00,657 --> 01:33:03,091
Hey, what's up?

1050
01:33:03,093 --> 01:33:05,026
Don't worry.

1051
01:33:05,028 --> 01:33:06,661
We don't need him anyway.

1052
01:33:06,663 --> 01:33:09,798
There are still ten of us.

1053
01:33:15,906 --> 01:33:19,843
It appears The Beast
is not done here yet.

1054
01:33:42,733 --> 01:33:45,133
We've got eyes on him.
Please advise.

1055
01:33:47,403 --> 01:33:48,839
Please advise.

1056
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:10,627
The collection
of main characters.

1057
01:34:52,202 --> 01:34:56,538
Keep patients and staff away
from the south-side windows.

1058
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,508
Authorities are on their way.

1059
01:35:19,963 --> 01:35:21,496
Okay. I got you.

1060
01:35:28,839 --> 01:35:33,208
You will learn to kneel
before the broken.

1061
01:36:20,624 --> 01:36:23,258
I need to explain.
He has D.I.D.

1062
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:25,694
- He believes he's an animal.
- Keep moving.

1063
01:36:25,696 --> 01:36:27,128
No, you don't understand.

1064
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:28,730
All he knows is pain.

1065
01:36:28,732 --> 01:36:30,231
You're going to get hurt.

1066
01:36:30,233 --> 01:36:31,933
Somebody, please...

1067
01:36:31,935 --> 01:36:33,668
He has D.I.D.

1068
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:35,270
We can get the compassionate
people inside him

1069
01:36:35,272 --> 01:36:36,738
- to help you.
- Stay here.

1070
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:39,876
You're the girl
The Beast let go.

1071
01:37:09,773 --> 01:37:11,940
Stay away from him.

1072
01:37:11,942 --> 01:37:14,511
Go!

1073
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:40,438
I'm just trying to save you.

1074
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:19,040
Casey, the light
won't work out here now.

1075
01:38:19,042 --> 01:38:22,010
You have to be the one
to get Kevin to come out.

1076
01:38:22,012 --> 01:38:24,179
We need to get them
inside to safety.

1077
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:25,980
Do you hear me?

1078
01:38:27,651 --> 01:38:28,950
Dad, there are two

1079
01:38:28,952 --> 01:38:30,218
tactical teams on the way.

1080
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:32,020
Get back inside!

1081
01:38:37,428 --> 01:38:39,060
Hurry.

1082
01:38:39,062 --> 01:38:40,662
Get inside the building.

1083
01:38:51,875 --> 01:38:54,443
The water
used for David's room.

1084
01:38:54,445 --> 01:38:56,211
There's water in that tank.

1085
01:38:56,213 --> 01:38:58,780
I know he almost drowned
when he was a child.

1086
01:38:58,782 --> 01:39:01,151
Water is his weakness.

1087
01:39:02,953 --> 01:39:04,385
Hey!

1088
01:39:04,387 --> 01:39:05,420
- Hey!
- Joseph!

1089
01:39:05,422 --> 01:39:06,888
He's lying to you.

1090
01:39:06,890 --> 01:39:09,023
In comics, the parents
of the villains

1091
01:39:09,025 --> 01:39:11,860
always hold a key to understanding them.

1092
01:39:11,862 --> 01:39:13,828
He's not telling you something.

1093
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:15,632
Joseph, get back!

1094
01:39:19,336 --> 01:39:22,203
Don't tell him yet.

1095
01:39:24,174 --> 01:39:28,444
Kevin's dad didn't just take
any train and not come home.

1096
01:39:44,462 --> 01:39:46,361
Eastrail 177.

1097
01:39:46,363 --> 01:39:48,665
Next stop, Philadelphia.

1098
01:40:16,826 --> 01:40:19,394
<i>He took the train
my dad was on.</i>

1099
01:40:19,396 --> 01:40:23,133
<i>The one that everyone died
except my dad.</i>

1100
01:40:29,839 --> 01:40:31,841
That's the key to who you are.

1101
01:40:33,843 --> 01:40:36,878
Mr. Glass killed Kevin's dad.

1102
01:40:50,193 --> 01:40:52,927
It's all evidence, you see?

1103
01:40:52,929 --> 01:40:55,129
If that train crash
hadn't happened,

1104
01:40:55,131 --> 01:40:58,066
Kevin wouldn't have been
left alone with his mother.

1105
01:40:58,068 --> 01:40:59,501
If Kevin's mother
wasn't allowed

1106
01:40:59,503 --> 01:41:00,502
to continue to abuse him,

1107
01:41:00,504 --> 01:41:03,805
then The Beast
wouldn't have had to be born.

1108
01:41:03,807 --> 01:41:06,442
What are the odds
that David Dunn

1109
01:41:06,444 --> 01:41:12,448
and Clarence Wendell Crumb
would be together that day?

1110
01:41:12,450 --> 01:41:14,150
Amazing.

1111
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:19,954
I created you,
as I created David.

1112
01:41:19,956 --> 01:41:23,559
It just took longer.

1113
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:26,027
19 years.

1114
01:41:26,029 --> 01:41:29,297
They almost convinced me
I was crazy.

1115
01:41:29,299 --> 01:41:33,935
I create superheroes.

1116
01:41:33,937 --> 01:41:38,574
I truly am a mastermind.

1117
01:41:40,176 --> 01:41:45,447
I thank you for what you did.

1118
01:41:45,449 --> 01:41:49,117
But I came to protect Kevin.

1119
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:55,524
And I cannot trust you
to keep him safe.

1120
01:41:59,996 --> 01:42:01,396
Hey.

1121
01:42:01,398 --> 01:42:04,132
We still haven't settled
that kneeling thing.

1122
01:42:04,134 --> 01:42:07,101
The classic turn.

1123
01:42:07,103 --> 01:42:09,505
The enemy becomes the ally

1124
01:42:09,507 --> 01:42:14,411
because of the hero's
unflinching sense of good.

1125
01:43:45,436 --> 01:43:50,039
We will finish this
in front of the world.

1126
01:44:07,056 --> 01:44:09,125
Elijah.

1127
01:44:18,769 --> 01:44:20,471
Release me.

1128
01:44:25,008 --> 01:44:27,008
Let me talk
to Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1129
01:44:28,746 --> 01:44:30,746
No!

1130
01:44:34,083 --> 01:44:36,485
Release me.

1131
01:44:36,487 --> 01:44:38,720
I need to talk
to Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1132
01:44:41,459 --> 01:44:43,525
He needs me.

1133
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,561
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1134
01:44:47,665 --> 01:44:48,764
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1135
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:53,236
Kevin Wendell Crumb.

1136
01:45:03,747 --> 01:45:05,516
Hey.

1137
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:09,383
The Beast listened to me.

1138
01:45:09,385 --> 01:45:11,252
He couldn't do what he wanted.

1139
01:45:11,254 --> 01:45:13,387
You can tell him what to do.

1140
01:45:13,389 --> 01:45:17,124
- I'm not in charge of the light.
- Yes.

1141
01:45:17,126 --> 01:45:20,127
Yes, you are.

1142
01:45:22,198 --> 01:45:25,099
It feels good.

1143
01:45:25,101 --> 01:45:26,635
Doesn't it?

1144
01:45:26,637 --> 01:45:29,471
Mm-hmm.

1145
01:45:29,473 --> 01:45:33,542
Will you stay
in the light with me?

1146
01:45:33,544 --> 01:45:35,479
For a little while?

1147
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:02,437
She was able
to turn him. Target down.

1148
01:46:18,354 --> 01:46:20,722
You guys got to help him.
That's my dad.

1149
01:46:20,724 --> 01:46:22,323
He's trying to help you guys.

1150
01:46:22,325 --> 01:46:23,825
The guy in the green,
that's my dad.

1151
01:46:23,827 --> 01:46:26,595
He's trying to stop the Horde.
He's really weak.

1152
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:06,602
David.

1153
01:47:06,604 --> 01:47:07,936
David, take my hand.

1154
01:47:07,938 --> 01:47:09,571
Take it now!

1155
01:47:34,330 --> 01:47:36,433
It's just us.

1156
01:47:41,371 --> 01:47:43,805
They sent me here
for you three.

1157
01:47:43,807 --> 01:47:46,808
Tell me the truth.

1158
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:50,179
Did I almost convince you
you were an ordinary man?

1159
01:47:53,383 --> 01:47:56,485
I would have left you alone,

1160
01:47:56,487 --> 01:48:01,592
but when the Horde showed up
here, then I just had to come.

1161
01:48:16,807 --> 01:48:19,441
Didn't you tell me
there was a showdown

1162
01:48:19,443 --> 01:48:21,743
at the end of a limited edition?

1163
01:48:21,745 --> 01:48:24,245
How come you didn't know
how it was gonna end?

1164
01:48:24,247 --> 01:48:25,814
Oh, Mama.

1165
01:48:25,816 --> 01:48:31,318
This is not a limited edition.

1166
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:34,990
This was an origin story

1167
01:48:34,992 --> 01:48:37,759
the whole time.

1168
01:49:00,851 --> 01:49:02,884
What's happening?

1169
01:49:07,758 --> 01:49:09,891
I like being nine.

1170
01:49:11,762 --> 01:49:14,395
It... it hurts, Casey.

1171
01:49:14,397 --> 01:49:15,964
Get it to stop hurting.

1172
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:22,003
I-I can't... hold on
to the light, Casey.

1173
01:49:25,341 --> 01:49:28,710
I should never
have listened to her.

1174
01:49:33,083 --> 01:49:35,784
Now these pants
got blood on them.

1175
01:49:35,786 --> 01:49:37,384
They're ruined.

1176
01:49:39,723 --> 01:49:42,758
We got to clean
these pants, Casey.

1177
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:48,630
As his body slowly
succumbs to the inevitable,

1178
01:49:48,632 --> 01:49:54,069
a sensation of cold water
spreads through his body.

1179
01:49:54,071 --> 01:50:00,542
His thoughts are a mixture
of fear and sweet relief.

1180
01:50:02,613 --> 01:50:05,346
Ladies and gentlemen,
here's Patricia.

1181
01:50:05,348 --> 01:50:07,816
We should all listen to her.

1182
01:50:09,787 --> 01:50:11,686
Did you see them?

1183
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:15,524
They are both extraordinary.

1184
01:50:15,526 --> 01:50:18,359
I never doubted. I...

1185
01:50:18,361 --> 01:50:22,363
Never let them tell you
I doubted it.

1186
01:50:25,702 --> 01:50:27,569
They're all so scared.

1187
01:50:27,571 --> 01:50:31,675
But I told them that I'm gonna
hold the light now.

1188
01:50:34,578 --> 01:50:37,681
You really my friend?

1189
01:50:40,584 --> 01:50:42,651
Then I'm gonna hold the light
till the end.

1190
01:50:42,653 --> 01:50:44,387
Till the very end.

1191
01:50:47,457 --> 01:50:50,326
It's not so bad
being in the light.

1192
01:50:58,936 --> 01:51:00,871
Kevin.

1193
01:51:37,174 --> 01:51:40,508
Would you mind
stepping away for a moment

1194
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:42,713
so I can check him?

1195
01:51:44,648 --> 01:51:46,750
It's okay.

1196
01:52:05,202 --> 01:52:07,537
They got it wrong
in the comics.

1197
01:52:09,239 --> 01:52:11,239
They talk about
secret evil groups

1198
01:52:11,241 --> 01:52:13,775
trying to stop the heroes.

1199
01:52:13,777 --> 01:52:16,211
I don't think
we are particularly evil,

1200
01:52:16,213 --> 01:52:19,114
and we don't choose sides.

1201
01:52:19,116 --> 01:52:20,949
We try to stop both of you.

1202
01:52:20,951 --> 01:52:25,987
If there is one of you,
the opposite of you appears.

1203
01:52:25,989 --> 01:52:27,255
It escalates.

1204
01:52:27,257 --> 01:52:29,591
We step in.

1205
01:52:29,593 --> 01:52:33,595
There just can't be
gods amongst us.

1206
01:52:33,597 --> 01:52:34,996
It's not fair.

1207
01:52:34,998 --> 01:52:40,535
It has worked just fine
for 10,000 years our way.

1208
01:52:40,537 --> 01:52:42,771
Take consolation in the fact

1209
01:52:42,773 --> 01:52:46,074
that you were right
about your theory.

1210
01:52:46,076 --> 01:52:49,012
Be at peace.

1211
01:53:08,565 --> 01:53:13,670
I wasn't a mistake, Mama.

1212
01:53:14,871 --> 01:53:16,006
No.

1213
01:53:18,075 --> 01:53:20,877
You were spectacular.

1214
01:53:37,928 --> 01:53:41,162
<i>These patients
were very disturbed.</i>

1215
01:53:41,164 --> 01:53:43,798
<i>Let me just simply state,
everything that occurred</i>

1216
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,934
<i>was related to drugs
in their systems</i>

1217
01:53:45,936 --> 01:53:47,902
<i>or their heightened
state of mania.</i>

1218
01:53:47,904 --> 01:53:49,904
<i>For the patients' privacy,</i>

1219
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,773
let's keep what happened
in this building

1220
01:53:51,775 --> 01:53:54,578
and this parking lot
to ourselves.

1221
01:53:55,846 --> 01:53:56,978
...general public alike.

1222
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:58,279
Opening ceremonies
have concluded,

1223
01:53:58,281 --> 01:54:00,015
but from the looks on the faces

1224
01:54:00,017 --> 01:54:02,119
of the thousand...

1225
01:54:37,087 --> 01:54:39,623
All three were real.

1226
01:54:41,224 --> 01:54:44,893
Quite special, actually.

1227
01:54:44,895 --> 01:54:49,798
If you approve,
I will move to the next city.

1228
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,367
Will there be
any repercussions?

1229
01:54:52,369 --> 01:54:54,803
No one saw them.

1230
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:58,006
I know what my charge is.

1231
01:54:58,008 --> 01:54:59,908
Convince them.

1232
01:54:59,910 --> 01:55:03,845
This is the most humane
and effective method.

1233
01:55:03,847 --> 01:55:07,882
We're not executioners,
and we don't need martyrs.

1234
01:55:07,884 --> 01:55:11,853
If that fails, use the machine.

1235
01:55:11,855 --> 01:55:15,390
And I understand how important
what we're doing is.

1236
01:55:15,392 --> 01:55:18,393
Maintaining balance.

1237
01:55:18,395 --> 01:55:20,764
Keeping order.

1238
01:55:42,219 --> 01:55:44,152
We're not here
to buy umbrellas,

1239
01:55:44,154 --> 01:55:45,086
and you know it.

1240
01:55:45,088 --> 01:55:47,055
Spread your wings,
Mr. K.G. Bird.

1241
01:55:47,057 --> 01:55:49,023
We're flying you down
to headquarters.

1242
01:55:49,025 --> 01:55:51,693
On what charge, Boy Wonder?

1243
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:53,094
Illegal umbrellas.

1244
01:55:53,096 --> 01:55:55,263
Assault and battery,
disturbing the peace.

1245
01:55:55,265 --> 01:55:58,467
We've got enough to put you
back on ice, Penguin.

1246
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:07,976
He's too smart.

1247
01:56:07,978 --> 01:56:10,278
That's why he's the mastermind.

1248
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:13,214
He'll never
tell you his real plan.

1249
01:56:13,216 --> 01:56:14,716
He sets everybody up.

1250
01:56:14,718 --> 01:56:16,417
Gets them looking
in one direction.

1251
01:56:16,419 --> 01:56:18,454
So cool, man.

1252
01:56:18,456 --> 01:56:22,092
There's always a real plan.

1253
01:56:32,470 --> 01:56:34,736
You see this camera?

1254
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:37,372
There are 100 more of these.

1255
01:56:37,374 --> 01:56:40,277
Everything is being recorded.

1256
01:56:49,186 --> 01:56:51,419
<i>All videos
and all backup videos</i>

1257
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:54,822
<i>- have been erased, correct?
- Yes.</i>

1258
01:56:54,824 --> 01:56:57,260
Was any of it downloaded
before that?

1259
01:57:05,268 --> 01:57:08,102
I don't know
how this is possible.

1260
01:57:08,104 --> 01:57:11,139
Someone was streaming
the live security feed

1261
01:57:11,141 --> 01:57:13,176
to a private site.

1262
01:57:37,267 --> 01:57:39,400
He went through
the basement tunnels

1263
01:57:39,402 --> 01:57:42,303
to be seen by
as many cameras as possible.

1264
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:46,274
That's why he didn't go out
the side entrance.

1265
01:57:46,276 --> 01:57:48,076
<i>He was never planning</i>

1266
01:57:48,078 --> 01:57:49,946
<i>on going to that building.</i>

1267
01:57:52,516 --> 01:57:55,018
This was a suicide mission.

1268
01:57:56,286 --> 01:58:00,190
I gave him all the cameras
he needed right here.

1269
01:58:11,167 --> 01:58:15,038
What have you done, Elijah?

1270
01:59:10,894 --> 01:59:12,628
There are unknown forces

1271
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:17,100
that don't want us to realize
what we are truly capable of.

1272
01:59:19,202 --> 01:59:22,170
They don't want us
to know the things we suspect

1273
01:59:22,172 --> 01:59:25,641
are extraordinary
about ourselves are real.

1274
01:59:37,053 --> 01:59:41,356
<i>I believe that if everyone sees
what just a few people become</i>

1275
01:59:41,358 --> 01:59:44,526
<i>when they wholly embrace
their gifts,</i>

1276
01:59:44,528 --> 01:59:46,831
<i>others will awaken.</i>

1277
01:59:50,701 --> 01:59:56,472
<i>Belief in oneself
is contagious.</i>

1278
01:59:56,474 --> 02:00:00,975
<i>We give each other permission
to be superheroes.</i>

1279
02:00:00,977 --> 02:00:04,981
<i>We will never awaken
otherwise.</i>

1280
02:00:11,121 --> 02:00:13,455
<i>Whoever these people are</i>

1281
02:00:13,457 --> 02:00:17,091
<i>who don't want us
to know the truth,</i>

1282
02:00:17,093 --> 02:00:21,229
<i>today, they lose.</i>

1283
02:00:47,558 --> 02:00:49,325
Thanks.

1284
02:00:57,501 --> 02:01:01,035
How long's it been
since we posted it?

1285
02:01:01,037 --> 02:01:03,273
Two hours.

1286
02:01:08,044 --> 02:01:10,246
How long will it be before...?

1287
02:02:03,199 --> 02:02:05,301
I know what this is.

1288
02:02:08,706 --> 02:02:13,243
This is the moment
we are let in on the universe.

1289
02:03:00,412 --> 02:03:04,860

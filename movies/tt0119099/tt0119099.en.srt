00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,834
<i>I want to tell you
about the time I almost died.</i>

3
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,146
<i>I never thought it
would happen to me.</i>

4
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:02,897
<i>Not at this age.</i>

5
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:06,735
<i>Beaten, outsmarted.</i>

6
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:10,280
<i>How did I get into this fix?
How did it all begin?</i>

7
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:13,074
<i>No, no, no. If I go back to the beginning
that'll take forever.</i>

8
00:01:13,283 --> 00:01:15,869
<i>So let's start more recently.</i>

9
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,622
<i>Somewhere. Anywhere.</i>

10
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,625
<i>Reese.</i>

11
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:58,369
I thought the governor didn't approve
of this.

12
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:01,873
The more they don't approve,
the more they want to watch.

13
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:05,168
So, what is this,
six notches on your belt?

14
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,920
Eight.

15
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:10,131
- Congratulations.
- Fuck you.

16
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,258
Ask me more nicely, huh?

17
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,135
John Hobbes.

18
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:17,263
You're wanted in the dance hall.

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,070
- Hey.
- Edgar Reese.

20
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:36,866
Well, well, well. Look who's here.

21
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,787
It's the brilliant detective
who sealed my brutish fate.

22
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,747
That's right.

23
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,501
So, what is this?
They making you famous now?

24
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,421
Oh, big time. They're gonna put me
in the movies. Documentary.

25
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,675
All courtesy of the ACLU.
They shoot me getting smoked.

26
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,805
Who knows?
Maybe it'll be a big video rental.

27
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,724
All these society ladies showing it
to their dinner guests.

28
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:05,186
"Ooh, you see that there?
That's a urine stain, ladies." Ha, ha.

29
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,981
"Oh, my, it's not urine." Ha, ha.

30
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:12,110
- It's good to see you, Hobbes.
- It's good to be seen by you, Reese.

31
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,361
Sure.

32
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,865
You're, uh...

33
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,992
...my best pal.

34
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,504
Ah.

35
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,675
You're still a good fella.

36
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,032
Open the gate.

37
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:04,245
You know,
you remind me of somebody, Hobbes.

38
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:08,416
Oh, indeed you do. Indeed you do.

39
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,878
- Do you like riddles?
- No, I don't.

40
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,673
Here's a beaut.

41
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:21,012
Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?

42
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:24,432
- What?
- Come on. You should know this one, pal.

43
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,559
You should know this one.

44
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:29,020
Open your eyes. Look around sometime.

45
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,736
Open the gate.

46
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,572
Remember this, Hobbes.

47
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:45,036
A day, a week, a month.

48
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,748
What are you, a Nazi now?

49
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:52,460
It's Dutch.

50
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,837
What goes around...

51
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,715
...really goes around.

52
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,343
You have a safe trip, hear?

53
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:02,595
I'll be looking for you.

54
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:13,398
What goes around really goes around.

55
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:19,529
Hey! Howdy, folks.

56
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:23,491
Ladies, gents, cocksuckers, pederasts.

57
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,703
I hope you all enjoy the show. Yes, I do.

58
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:44,739
Hey, I'll give you a blowjob
if you get me out of this, baby.

59
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,955
Yee-haw!

60
00:06:54,957 --> 00:07:00,046
<i>Time is on my side</i>

61
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,964
<i>Yes, it is</i>

62
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:06,803
<i>Time is on my side</i>

63
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,013
<i>Yes, it is</i>

64
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:14,018
<i>Now, you always say
That you wanna be free</i>

65
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:17,563
<i>Well, I'll come running back</i>

66
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:22,777
<i>I'll come running back to you</i>

67
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,863
Baby, come on, go ahead...

68
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,449
...light up my life!

69
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:59,981
<i>Something is always happening.</i>

70
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:04,819
<i>But when it happens,
people don't always see</i> it...

71
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,488
...or <i>understand</i> it...

72
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,450
<i>...or accept it.</i>

73
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:23,397
<i>The criminals
don't accept consequences, huh?</i>

74
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,359
<i>They kill somebody,
somehow it's not their fault.</i>

75
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,986
<i>- This is the consequence.</i>
- Hey, look who made it.

76
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,072
- Mr. Consequence.
- How'd it go?

77
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,740
- He died.
- Told you.

78
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,158
Gracie, he got one more.

79
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,079
- Hey, detective, nice to see you.
- How you doing, Gracie?

80
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,456
- Don't tempt me with that.
- Oh, man. Sorry.

81
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:42,917
What's your poison?
We're working on some Beck's.

82
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,545
We got some Guinness.
We got some Bass.

83
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:48,631
- Budweiser's good for me.
- Budweiser?

84
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,882
- Yeah.
- Good.

85
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,759
- We're going imported here.
- Please.

86
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,553
- You can't afford it, I'll buy.
- I can afford it. Budweiser.

87
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,931
- Okay.
- Well, at least have a Bud Ice...

88
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,474
...or a Bud Dry or something.

89
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:01,435
Lou, it is just a Bud, okay?

90
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,188
- You guys want anything?
- No.

91
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:05,523
Here's your Bud.

92
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,317
<i>He was one of the most notorious inmates
in this prison.</i>

93
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:11,112
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

94
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,156
You're an unusual cop, Hobbes.

95
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,992
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

96
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:19,912
I've been in this precinct about what, uh,
five, six months?

97
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:22,456
And everybody says,
"Hobbes don't take no cream.

98
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,542
Hobbes don't take no cream."

99
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,085
Now is that true, or what?

100
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,671
No, I don't like cream, Lou.

101
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,299
- That means "no"?
- Yeah, it means "no."

102
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:35,136
Now, is that "no" as in "never,"
"no" as in "sometimes"...

103
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,139
...or "no" as in
"I do, but I don't like to talk about it"?

104
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,974
"No" as in "never."

105
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:47,064
This is a big city, Hobbesy.
We got a tradition to uphold.

106
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,276
Something wrong with your ears?
Man says something, he says it.

107
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,738
It's a hypothetical. You know,
a cop who's trying to make ends meet...

108
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,906
...wants a little something on the side.

109
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:58,951
I don't like cream. And I don't judge.

110
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,828
You don't judge?

111
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:02,621
He's a fucking saint, huh?

112
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,374
So you're telling me
that under no circumstances...

113
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:08,210
...would a holy man like you
ever, you know...

114
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:11,088
...break the law or do something...

115
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,716
Look, Lou...

116
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:18,054
...I could jump across the table,
snatch your heart right out of your chest...

117
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:21,682
...squeeze the blood out,
stick it in your front pocket. I could do that.

118
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,851
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. If I lost control.

119
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,936
But if I did...

120
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:28,564
...I would be no different
than the people we bust.

121
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,151
Now, as to your general question...

122
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,071
...you take any cop out on the force,
cream or no...

123
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,325
...99 percent of the time,
they're doing their job, aren't they?

124
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,952
- Ninety-nine five.
- Point five.

125
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:44,497
So he or she, cream or no...

126
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:47,917
...is doing more good out there
on the street every day...

127
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,503
...than any, uh, lawyer or stockbroker...

128
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:54,507
...or, uh, president of the United States
can ever do in their lifetime.

129
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:59,053
Ah. Cops are the chosen people.

130
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,721
Amen.

131
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,773
Guess I'm switching to Bud.

132
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,985
Gracie, come here and get this foreign shit
off my table...

133
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,487
...and bring me three Buds.

134
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,618
<i>She's been waiting all her life</i>

135
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,745
- For a man of <i>steel</i>
- Over there.

136
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,596
Can you believe that? Ha, ha.

137
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,450
Yo, give me a burger?

138
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:42,364
Damn it, Charles, what took you so long?
There's a room up on 13 that--

139
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,868
You know what you'd look like
with this sandwich up your ass?

140
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:47,578
Pardon me?

141
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:52,291
Like a fat, stupid fuck
with a sandwich up his ass.

142
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,627
- Charles, I hate to do this but--
- Yeah.

143
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,214
Put the job where the sandwich goes.

144
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,361
Hello.

145
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,322
Hello.

146
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,242
Hello?

147
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:41,131
Here we go. Juice, pretzels, apple.

148
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,968
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

149
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:46,554
Uncle John, will you please
make my lunch tomorrow?

150
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:47,805
Here's Toby.

151
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,390
- Hey, Mr. Hobbes.
- Hi, Toby.

152
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,892
I can't be having the same thing every day.

153
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,770
What do you want, uh,
peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

154
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,313
- No.
- Heh.

155
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,149
- What? Jelly and peanut butter?
- No.

156
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,901
All right.

157
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,695
- I love you, Dad.
- Wait, wait.

158
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,863
Don't forget your Uncle Johnny.

159
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,576
- I can feel the love in this room, man.
- Bye, Uncle Johnny.

160
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,869
- Bye.
- Be good, hear.

161
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,665
- Have a good day at school.
- Okay. Bye.

162
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,876
You're doing a good job, Art.

163
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,420
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

164
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:22,131
Why don't you sit down with me, huh?
Let's talk a bit.

165
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,467
- You're not in a hurry or something?
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

166
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,261
I can relax today.

167
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,055
Besides, what are they gonna do?
Fire me?

168
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,183
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

169
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,185
- You're all right?
- Yeah.

170
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,191
I love you, Johnny.

171
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:44,737
You ever--?

172
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,115
You ever think it would be easier,
your life would be easier...

173
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,701
...or something if maybe me and Sam
were not living with--?

174
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,536
No, no, no, no, no.

175
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,750
- Maybe Marcy wouldn't have left.
- Later for Marcy.

176
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,752
If she loved me,
she would have never left.

177
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,714
Besides, family's always first.
You're my brother, right? Huh?

178
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,424
Yeah.

179
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,177
I love you too, Art.

180
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,475
But don't make the boy any more
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

181
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,978
- No more peanut butter and jelly, heh.
- Okay.

182
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,270
<i>A</i> cop knows.

183
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,523
<i>A cop sees.</i>

184
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:06,443
<i>Even the most casual thing, it registers.</i>

185
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:14,827
<i>Often you don't remember till later on.
But then you look back and you realize...</i>

186
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,621
<i>you knew.</i>

187
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,378
- Hey, good morning, detective.
- Mikey, Mike.

188
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,463
- How you doing, lieutenant?
- Hey, Hobbes.

189
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,090
Look who's feeling good today.

190
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,802
Hey, what can I say?
Hey, you're looking better than me.

191
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,722
- Got a call on 4, Hobbes.
- Thank you, Denise.

192
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,974
- Jonesy.
- Hey.

193
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,475
How's everything today? Good?

194
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,645
Detective Hobbes.

195
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,439
Hey, pal, you got a <i>pen?</i>

196
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,691
- Blanche?
- 4541...

197
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,943
<i>...South Stender, Apartment 2.</i>

198
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,030
- Who's there?
- <i>A clue,</i> Magoo.

199
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,032
Clue, Magoo.

200
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,618
Couldn't sleep last night, Jones.

201
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:57,995
Who can?

202
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,833
Remember I used to get calls, 2 or 3:00
in the morning from Reese?

203
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,085
He loved you, Hobbes. He truly did.

204
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:08,630
Somebody called me last night.
Imagine that.

205
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,215
- Denise?
- Yeah?

206
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:13,886
Send a car over to 4541 South Stender,
Apartment 2.

207
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,637
Make sure we gain entry, huh?

208
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,223
- Got a body?
- It's probably just some knucklehead...

209
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,185
...who saw me on TV
trying to impress his girl.

210
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,103
- How'd I look last night?
- Fabulous.

211
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:26,857
- You saw that? On four different channels.
- You're a god. You're a god.

212
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:36,366
Name's Muskavich. Russian expatriate.

213
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,328
Super says no family, no friends,
no nothing.

214
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:40,788
Why is he dead then?

215
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,209
What you got, Jonesy?

216
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:49,046
I got puncture wounds.

217
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:52,132
Look for a syringe or something.

218
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,218
Eighteen.

219
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,012
- What is that, his 18th victim?
- Could be.

220
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,389
Could be.

221
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,818
Very tidy.

222
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:14,363
The DOA's been dead awhile,
so what the hell is this, huh?

223
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:18,700
Killer slept over and then, uh,
had a nice, neat breakfast.

224
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,994
Looks like it.

225
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,706
Check this out.

226
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,302
Shit.

227
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,138
- What?
- It's a riddle.

228
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,433
Reese, in his cell before he died,
he asked me:

229
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:48,230
"Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?"

230
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,982
Yeah?

231
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:58,615
An accomplice?
Reese had an accomplice?

232
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:01,451
Unless it's a copycat.
You know, maybe the, uh...

233
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,122
...prison guards or the people
that made the documentary.

234
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,207
- You got a minute?
- I'll be there in a second.

235
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,252
Fifty people must have seen
that documentary by now.

236
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,921
Well, me and Jonesy will run them down.

237
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:15,716
Yeah, go ahead.

238
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,052
Fingerprint. Perp wore no gloves.

239
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:23,098
He left prints on the spoon and
the cereal bowl like he was advertising.

240
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,100
Maybe his prints aren't in the system.

241
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,020
- I hate to be stupid--
- Enjoy it, Lou.

242
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,480
--But is, uh, motive still something
we think about...

243
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,692
...or are we thinking these crimes are done
out of sickness?

244
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,402
Eh. Number 2, Lou.

245
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:39,197
Everything is motive. Sickness is motive.

246
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,992
Look sharp, Bud.
The coroner's prelim on the Russki.

247
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:45,537
Isn't that that wacko poison that, uh,
Reese used on them Arab kids?

248
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,835
- Tiff?
- Yeah?

249
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:55,714
You like, uh, riddles? You know, uh,
puzzles and shit? Brainteasers?

250
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,008
Sure, as long as I'm doing the teasing.

251
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:02,262
Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?

252
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:05,182
What does that even mean, man?
Come on.

253
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,019
We had a Spakowsky in my rookie year.
South Precinct.

254
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,981
- Come again?
- Not your Spakowsky. This guy's a cop.

255
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,108
Keep talking, Lou.

256
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,902
The guy's a fucking asshole.

257
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,614
He's the King Kong of assholes.
He's a fucking legend.

258
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,074
His name's up on the wall.

259
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:27,788
What?

260
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:34,086
Some chief in the '30s
thought it would boost morale.

261
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:38,507
They kept it up till like '81 or '82 and
it got to be like some fucking booby prize.

262
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:42,260
Remember it was downtown in the lobby,
till they did the remodeling?

263
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:45,472
- Must have passed it a thousand times.
- I just need to open my eyes...

264
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,599
...and look around sometime, huh?
- Yeah.

265
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:51,103
Lyons, I don't remember him,
but Spakowsky, he was around.

266
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,729
This guy was so fucking mean...

267
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,399
...his wife shot him in the foot
and he couldn't get disability.

268
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,110
Lou, who was '65, huh?
Who was in that space right there?

269
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,404
You got me, bud. I don't know.

270
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:04,741
So you're saying they took a name oh'?
Why did they do that?

271
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,912
I don't know. I called Records.
They say they don't know who it was...

272
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,623
...and they don't know why it's not there.

273
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,418
Well, we better find out, huh?

274
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,934
Ah, lieutenant,
just the man I wanted to see.

275
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,728
Booya.

276
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,607
- "Robert Milano."
- That's right.

277
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,942
Cop of the Year, 1965.

278
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,862
Eight months later, goes up to a cabin
in the middle of nowhere...

279
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,155
...dies cleaning his gun.

280
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:30,494
He was dirty or it was a woman.

281
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,246
What?

282
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:36,041
I met him once, Milano.

283
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:39,294
He had a poker up his ass
but otherwise he was a good cop.

284
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:42,589
- What I wanna know is--
- I know what you want.

285
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:44,925
I can't help you.

286
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,676
You can't help me?

287
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,428
Look...

288
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,473
...do all of us a favor, okay?

289
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:55,852
Whatever you find out,
keep it to yourself.

290
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:03,902
Hey, I got something for you.
Documentary on Reese.

291
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:06,655
Yeah, thank you. You're a real white man.

292
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,448
- Jonesy.
- Yo.

293
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:11,326
- Tape on Reese. You wanna view it?
- Give me a sec.

294
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,996
- What do you got on Muskavich? Anything?
- Fingerprints were a bust.

295
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,999
The crime scene says
the killer probably had dark hair.

296
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,418
- He probably was left-handed.
- Yeah, like Reese.

297
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:24,089
Uh, he had bad teeth.
Found a piece in the corn flakes.

298
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,550
<i>Directory Assistance.</i>

299
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,927
Yeah.
Can you give me a number on a Milano?

300
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:31,763
- Sylvia M-I-L-A-N-O.
- Hold, please.

301
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,557
Hey, lieutenant.

302
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,392
- Excuse me, boss.
- Yeah, yeah.

303
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:41,189
If somebody dies
because you kept your mouth shut...

304
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:45,819
...you're the one holding the bag, not me.
- When it's a perfect world, let me know.

305
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:50,031
In the meantime,
it's not me keeping his mouth shut.

306
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,075
- That clear enough for you?
- Yeah, yeah.

307
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,035
<i>I'm sorry, there's no listing.</i>

308
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:57,455
Yeah, okay, okay, thanks. Now listen, listen.
You still there? Hello?

309
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:01,918
Yeah. Check and see if there's a G. Milano,
a Gretta Milano. Can you do that for me?

310
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,295
- Hold, please.
- All right.

311
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,838
Syringe had the same prints.

312
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:10,719
- So now what? Video time?
- Yeah. Yup.

313
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,054
Uh, you know, I was thinking...

314
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,390
- Hey, don't hurt yourself.
- Eat me, Lou.

315
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,559
<i>Hold for the number, please.</i>

316
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,645
Whoever did Muskavich,
knew the poison that Reese used.

317
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:23,899
He quotes Reese. He could be a cop.

318
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:25,609
Yeah, he could be, huh?

319
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,986
- Huh, Lou, could be a cop, huh?
- What?

320
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,322
<i>Leave a message. Thank you.</i>

321
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,408
<i>Make sure Hobbes gets a copy of this.</i>

322
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:37,662
<i>Are you watching, Johnny boy?
I hope you're paying close attention.</i>

323
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:40,624
<i>Every gesture! Every word!</i>

324
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,843
- Wait a second.
- What?

325
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,470
Check something out.

326
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:04,648
The, um, language he was speaking,
later?

327
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:06,775
That's Dutch?

328
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:09,027
That's what he said.

329
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:12,280
What's he speaking now? Is that Dutch?

330
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,491
This now?

331
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:18,495
This is, uh, mumbo-jumbo, gibberish.

332
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:22,040
Oh? You sure on that?

333
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,602
<i>Who is it?</i>

334
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:46,648
<i>It's Detective John Hobbes.
I'm looking for Miss Gretta Milano.</i>

335
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,902
- Oh, yes. You left a message.
- Yes.

336
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,697
I wanted to talk to you about your father.

337
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:01,079
How you doing?

338
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,081
May I come in?

339
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,085
Sure.

340
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,056
You're, uh, surrounded by angels.

341
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,726
I teach theology at the university.

342
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,270
Ah, I see, I see. Very beautiful.

343
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,105
Thank you.

344
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,191
Why do you wanna know
about my father, detective?

345
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,654
Well, um, it's, uh, 30 years later...

346
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,699
...and the files are sealed...

347
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,952
...and my boss was told to, uh,
let it alone...

348
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:44,122
...so here I am.

349
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,835
Okay. Well, I can tell you
what my mother told me before she died.

350
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,756
Why do you wanna know?
I mean, are you just curious or...?

351
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:57,385
No, ma'am, no. See, I'm the detective
who, uh, caught Edgar Reese.

352
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:00,096
I'm not sure if you're familiar with him.
He was just executed.

353
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:02,223
- Yeah, I read about him.
- Right, right.

354
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,393
And this, uh, Reese fella, he, um...

355
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,688
...in a roundabout way,
he gave me your father's name.

356
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,320
Did Reese like to sing?

357
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,822
Yeah, he did, actually.

358
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,952
And at the execution,
did he try and touch you or grab you?

359
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,789
Yeah, he did. He shook my hand.

360
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,457
Yeah.

361
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,418
- You want some coffee?
- Sure.

362
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:34,506
One condition.

363
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,800
You and I never spoke.

364
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:40,303
You say nothing to your boss or partner.
Nothing goes in the files.

365
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:44,307
My name and everything I say
is just between us. Is that agreeable?

366
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:47,102
Will I get a cup of coffee if I say yes?

367
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:53,274
Detective, my dad was a good cop.

368
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:57,404
"Pride of the force" and all that.
And then he shot himself.

369
00:28:57,612 --> 00:29:00,740
A reporter found out
my father had been under investigation.

370
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:04,244
He'd caught a killer,
but copycat crimes started.

371
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,705
fingerprints, witnesses.

372
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:12,043
The press never got real proof,
but my father's medal was rescinded.

373
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,586
I see.

374
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:18,800
So you're saying that, uh, when he died,
someone made this evidence go away?

375
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,762
The mayor and the governor,
chief of police, they all needed a hero.

376
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:25,306
And some of these people
are still important today.

377
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:28,101
- I see.
- No. Not yet, you don't.

378
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:32,939
My father saw the evidence, told my mother
he didn't stand a chance to beat it.

379
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,692
So he went to this cabin
in the mountains.

380
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,820
It's a place that's been
in my mother's family for generations.

381
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,906
He went there and...

382
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:46,744
The thing is, detective...

383
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:49,372
...I know my father was innocent
of those murders.

384
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:51,458
How do you know?

385
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,004
How do you know he was innocent?

386
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,925
It's 30 years ago.
It's not important any more.

387
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,136
Uh, well, it's important to me,
Miss Milano.

388
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,847
Don't you want the truth to come out,
the killer to be punished?

389
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:08,224
- Of course I do.
- But?

390
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,606
Are you afraid if you tell me
your life may be in danger...

391
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,441
...or something like that?

392
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,319
- Yeah.
- And that's it?

393
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:21,488
Yes.

394
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,991
Okay.

395
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:30,163
Okay. Thank you very much.

396
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:33,082
- Uh, for the coffee as well.
- Okay.

397
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:39,672
Oh, listen, uh, if I have any more questions,
can I call you?

398
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,549
I'd rather you didn't.

399
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,724
Detective.

400
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,227
Do you believe in God?

401
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,731
Yeah. I mean, you know,
I go to church every now and then.

402
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,110
What I see in my line of work,
faith's a little hard to sustain.

403
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:04,739
Good luck.

404
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,669
<i>Sometimes I think the basic job
that human beings have...</i>

405
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,713
<i>...is just to figure out
what the hell is going on.</i>

406
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:23,258
<i>Gretta Milano.</i>

407
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:27,136
<i>Now, what was she hiding?
What was she so scared of?</i>

408
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:31,140
<i>And then her question about God
What the hell is that all about?</i>

409
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,193
<i>You never know.
Down to the smallest thing.</i>

410
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,698
<i>The man who passes you on the street,
catches your eye. Does he know you?</i>

411
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,283
<i>Did you go to school together?</i>

412
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:51,244
<i>Is he a homicidal maniac
who hates you on sight?</i>

413
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,750
<i>Or is it nothing?</i>

414
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,837
<i>Nothing at all.</i>

415
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:39,000
<i>I'm coming apart a little at a time.</i>

416
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,461
<i>A little at a time.</i>

417
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:44,839
Art?

418
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:48,635
- Art.
- Huh?

419
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,261
Wake up.

420
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:52,347
Sam?

421
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,809
Come on, go to bed. Sam, Sam.

422
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,438
All right. I know. I know.

423
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,690
Here we go. UP- UP-

424
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:05,360
I'm going. I'm going, Uncle John.

425
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:06,694
Up.

426
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,491
Hello?

427
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,368
Hello?

428
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,792
Let's go, Sam.

429
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:32,720
- Good night.
- Good night, son.

430
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,310
- Johnny?
- Yeah?

431
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,270
You ever get scared?

432
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:45,191
Yeah, sometimes.

433
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,652
Oh.

434
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:51,489
Me too.

435
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,627
Good night, Art.

436
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:28,484
- Hello?
- Mrs. Moohr? Uh, this is Charles.

437
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:31,195
Apparently, I must have gotten drunk
or something...

438
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:32,739
...because the last few days...

439
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,033
Am I working tonight?

440
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:38,995
- You <i>quit,</i> Charles.
- I quit?

441
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:42,415
<i>Yes. You insulted Harry
and he hired someone else.</i>

442
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,125
Oh, but-- I mean, how--?

443
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,339
Look, I'm really sorry, I...

444
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:53,718
Could you apologize, please,
to your husband for whatever I--?

445
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:56,929
<i>MOOHR
We always liked you, Charles. Goodbye.</i>

446
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,181
Yeah. I--

447
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:16,407
--47, 48, 49, 50.

448
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:18,826
Hello?

449
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,621
<i>Hello</i>

450
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:27,251
<i>Well, well, well. Look who's here</i>

451
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,627
I played Reese's tape on the phone
to a linguist guy. He's coming down.

452
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:12,839
- Yeah? What's the prelim?
- Said it sounded Mideastern.

453
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,966
- Anything on Muskavich?
- Only the pizza.

454
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:17,593
Now we're hitting
your area of expertise, huh?

455
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:19,929
Pizza is the staff of life.

456
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:24,308
Without pizza and other fine Italian foods,
there would be no happiness, okay?

457
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:28,354
Garlic, linguiga and pineapple.

458
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:31,691
Plus, there was nothing
in Muskavich's stomach.

459
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,026
- So it was the killer's eats.
- Hell of a clue.

460
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:39,282
- You better write that one up for the journal.
- I will, Lou. And I will laud you copiously.

461
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,575
Thank you.

462
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,827
Detectives? Your guy's in Video.

463
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,246
Oh, hey, the linguist guy's here.

464
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:48,374
Yeah. I'll, uh, be right there.

465
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:52,545
Any luck?

466
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:55,298
John Hobbes,
Professor Richard Louders.

467
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:57,049
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

468
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,885
This is completely exhilarating.

469
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:01,804
Who is this convict? Can I speak to him?

470
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:04,015
Not now. Have a seat.

471
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:07,643
Professor says it's a language.
He's just never heard it spoken aloud.

472
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:09,979
- Meaning?
- Some kind of antique.

473
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:14,775
Well, I believe this is a Biblical tongue,
Syrian Aramaic.

474
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:17,194
Only a few nomadic tribes still use it.

475
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:20,615
- So you don't know what he's saying?
- I haven't the faintest.

476
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,408
He's not too pleasant, is he?

477
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,204
If you could spare me a copy,
I'd be more than happy to work it.

478
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,456
Hey, appreciate it.

479
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:31,417
Uh, listen, if you could wait out front
for 15 minutes...

480
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,419
- Of course.
- ...we'll dupe one for you.

481
00:37:33,628 --> 00:37:35,171
I'll be waiting.

482
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:38,132
- See you in a minute.
- Bye, detective.

483
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:45,973
- Syrian Aramaic.
- Imagine that.

484
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:50,019
I got something else too.
I'm looking up this, uh, clipping...

485
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:52,980
...of Reese, high-school baseball team.

486
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,524
He bats right.

487
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,318
He throws right.

488
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:00,947
What are you saying, Hobbes?

489
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:03,574
Reese pulled off some of the sickest shit
on record.

490
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:05,826
He's speaking a language
2000 years old...

491
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,954
...and you're worried
because he's ambidextrous?

492
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:09,538
I'm worried about everything.

493
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:13,000
- Hobbes, call on Line 1.
- Thank you, Bill.

494
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:16,295
Detective Hobbes.

495
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:18,798
<i>Hey, pal, need another clue?</i>

496
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:23,219
<i>1339 South Grove, Apartment 9.</i>

497
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:29,850
Jonesy, that pizza place
with the Number 17?

498
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,645
- Yeah.
- That close to Grove?

499
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,563
I think so.

500
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:54,083
They're in the same place, exactly.

501
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,002
Yeah?

502
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,714
- It's like he's laughing at us.
- He is.

503
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:10,933
- Cash, not a check?
- That's right.

504
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:17,273
- Jonesy?
- Yeah.

505
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:20,359
Take a look at this.

506
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:26,449
What the hell is this, huh?

507
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:36,542
You know what's scary?

508
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:42,965
Going home last night, this guy's walking
past me, he's going the other way.

509
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:45,051
He looks me right in the eye.

510
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:48,804
The kind of look like he knows you.
You know what I mean?

511
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:56,562
It's the same guy that's in the bathtub.
The stiff.

512
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:59,065
- You're shitting me.
- I shit you not. Same guy.

513
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,610
Oh, man.

514
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:05,821
I ain't smart enough to figure
what's going down.

515
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,114
Me neither.

516
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,449
From under the sink.

517
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:14,955
- Same poison?
- Same poison.

518
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:17,249
- Better get that down to the lab.
- Sure.

519
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,127
- What else you got?
- Okay, the number on his chest.

520
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,880
Last Thursday it's 18, now it's 2?

521
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:27,051
Everything's under a Charles Olom,
but it looks like that's an alias.

522
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:29,887
So, uh, we're running his prints.

523
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:41,398
To quote Yogi Berra,
"It's like déjé vu all over again."

524
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,276
- You mean Reese?
- Yeah.

525
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:50,157
And whoever is doing it
has a thing for Hobbes.

526
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:52,243
Seems like.

527
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,455
- How is he?
- Who, Hobbes?

528
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,959
How is he ever? He's fine. He's great.

529
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:03,003
Well, if it starts to work at him,
let me know, okay?

530
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,465
When it starts to work on me,
I'll let you know that too.

531
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:30,948
Thought that was you.

532
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:34,577
What are you doing, more, uh,
historical research?

533
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,287
Mm.

534
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:40,374
Nice talking to you. See you Monday.

535
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,293
All right, Lou.

536
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:45,337
Come on, Jimmy.

537
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:47,089
Over here, shoot it!

538
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:48,924
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!

539
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:51,177
Come on, come on, Sam. Okay.

540
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:54,221
Aw. Okay. That's okay, that's okay.
The score is tied.

541
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,391
- No, no, no, 19-17.
- Okay, 19-17.

542
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,936
- You can take him.
- Come on, Toby, pass the ball. I'm open.

543
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:02,646
Come on. Take the ball back.

544
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,273
Mr. Hobbes.

545
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:07,193
Johnny's gonna make the point.
He's got the ball.

546
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,320
- Hi, Art.
- Hey, how you doing?

547
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:12,865
Shoot on three, two, one.

548
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,116
Oh!

549
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:15,576
That's it for me. I've gotta go.

550
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,912
No, I gotta go. I have a long drive.

551
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,455
Art, you wanna get in here?

552
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:22,082
- Uncle John, but he's a spaz.
- Hey, hey.

553
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,793
Don't disrespect your father, okay?
You understand me?

554
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:27,254
- Yeah.
- Cherish what you got.

555
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:30,049
- Sammy, come on.
- Okay? Get on in there.

556
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:32,343
- Want some of this?
- I didn't bring my shoes.

557
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,388
- What's up?
- Tiffany didn't get you?

558
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:40,643
- No, what's up?
- You know how weird this case is?

559
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:46,357
- Hey.
- We got a positive ID on Charles Olom.

560
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:48,317
Real name's Mickey Noons.

561
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,945
Born in Canada, illegal alien.

562
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:53,781
Blah, blah, blah. Small time shithead.

563
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:57,159
- That ain't bad.
- That ain't it.

564
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,245
Noons is the guy that killed the Russki.

565
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:01,789
It's his prints
all over Muskavich's apartment.

566
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:03,374
What?

567
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:06,126
Let's see, Noons poisons Muskavich...

568
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:09,755
...dumps him in the tub,
sets out the corn flakes.

569
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:12,132
Three days later somebody does
the same to him.

570
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:13,676
- Exact.
- Yeah.

571
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:17,054
Exact because Noons and Muskavich
were killed by the same person.

572
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:19,848
- What? Some kind of ringmaster?
- I think so.

573
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:23,394
- Hey, Art. You and Sam don't forget lunch.
- Okay.

574
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:26,689
I don't know.
I can't seem to get my mind around it.

575
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:31,360
- I got a bad feeling about this.
- Yeah, me too.

576
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:34,905
Somebody's playing with my dick
and it ain't me.

577
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:39,243
- Yeah. See you.
- Bye.

578
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:42,454
- Ten minutes, Art.
- Okay.

579
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,725
<i>There are moments which mark your life.</i>

580
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:30,229
<i>Moments when you realize
nothing will ever be the same...</i>

581
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:33,857
<i>...and time is divided into two parts:</i>

582
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,070
<i>Before this and after this.</i>

583
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:12,187
<i>Sometimes you can feel
such a moment coming.</i>

584
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:15,983
<i>That's the test. Or so I tell myself.</i>

585
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:18,861
<i>I tell myself that at times like that...</i>

586
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:23,532
<i>...strong people keep moving forward
anyway...</i>

587
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:28,203
<i>...no matter what they're going to find.</i>

588
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:45,734
- Miss Milano.
- Oh, hello.

589
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:49,946
I went to your family's place
up in the mountains.

590
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,823
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

591
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:54,034
Let me get that for you.

592
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:55,994
The trees and the water.

593
00:49:56,203 --> 00:49:58,914
Absolutely beautiful.
What does "Azazel" mean?

594
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:05,337
Your father, he wrote it in the basement
on the wall, then he painted over it.

595
00:50:05,921 --> 00:50:08,715
My dictionary, uh, says that it's the, uh:

596
00:50:09,508 --> 00:50:12,636
"evil spirit of the wilderness."
Whatever that means, huh?

597
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:15,764
One of the books your father had up there
talks about demons...

598
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:17,766
...and how they move by touch.
What is that?

599
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:19,643
Walk away, Mr. Hobbes.

600
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:21,728
- Say again?
- If you enjoy your life...

601
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:25,691
...if there's even one human being
you care about, don't take this case.

602
00:50:28,402 --> 00:50:29,903
Uh...

603
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:34,825
It's out of my hands, Miss Milano.
I mean, it's my job.

604
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:37,703
Bye, Mr. Hobbes.

605
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:42,499
- That's it?
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.

606
00:50:56,263 --> 00:50:59,391
- Jonesy? Fax.
- Uh, thanks.

607
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:02,561
Hey, phone company sent
MUDs and LUDs...

608
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:05,105
...for Noons' and Muskavich's apartments.
- Yeah?

609
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:06,982
See those calls there?

610
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,610
They were made right around the time
they were killed, give or take.

611
00:51:10,861 --> 00:51:13,447
The killer called my house
from the scene of the crimes?

612
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:14,698
Sure looks like it.

613
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:17,659
- Reese used to call all hours of the night.
- Reese is dead.

614
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:20,287
Yeah, but whoever's doing this
is in league with Reese...

615
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:24,499
...or he was imitating Reese.
I know he's still calling my house.

616
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,960
How many times I gotta change
my phone number?

617
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:29,880
The more you change it, more it looks
like someone on the inside.

618
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:31,715
Yeah. Like a cop?

619
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,258
Yeah.

620
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:40,056
Hey, it's nothing to me...

621
00:51:40,724 --> 00:51:43,393
...but the egos upstairs...

622
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,229
- You hear me?
- Both ears.

623
00:51:46,438 --> 00:51:47,856
Good.

624
00:51:52,444 --> 00:51:54,863
I'm gonna lose my sense of humor.
What do you got?

625
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,532
Translation from the Aramaic:

626
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:59,785
"I can't enter you by touch.

627
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:04,080
But even when I can get inside you,
after I'm spirit, I won't.

628
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:07,584
I'll fuck you up and down, left and right."
That's in the Bible.

629
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:11,880
"If that doesn't work, I have other ways."
We need a translation of the translation.

630
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:14,424
Yeah.

631
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:26,812
- Anything else?
- Uh, no, I'm okay. Thanks.

632
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:31,233
O'Rourke's.

633
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:03,557
<i>I like the night.</i>

634
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:06,893
<i>The street, the smells.</i>

635
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:10,230
<i>The sense of another world.</i>

636
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:17,779
<i>Sometimes you come
face to face with yourself.</i>

637
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:21,611
Now put that card back in.

638
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,571
- Anywhere.
- All right.

639
00:55:24,614 --> 00:55:27,659
- Okay. Tell me when to stop, okay?
- Okay.

640
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:30,662
Yeah. Can you pronounce it
for me one more time?

641
00:55:32,414 --> 00:55:37,002
Okay, professor,
I think I got it. All right. Bye.

642
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:02,152
<i>I can get inside you. After I'm spirit, I won '2'.</i>

643
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:03,653
<i>No.</i>

644
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:05,447
<i>Better I get you for real.</i>

645
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:11,536
<i>Fuck you, up, down, left, right,
coming, going.</i>

646
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:14,039
<i>I'll get so close to you...</i>

647
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:16,416
<i>...so close it breaks you.</i>

648
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,919
<i>And if that doesn't work...</i>

649
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,172
<i>well, I have other ways</i>

650
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:26,217
<i>I have so many, many ways.</i>

651
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:47,322
Right. Fifteen minutes.

652
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:49,657
Mm-hm.

653
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,160
Hi. Can I help you?

654
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:53,828
Yeah.

655
00:56:54,204 --> 00:56:57,123
- You're releasing a Richard Suckle.
- Okay.

656
00:56:57,582 --> 00:57:00,960
- He called a cab.
- I'll have him brought right down.

657
00:57:06,716 --> 00:57:09,886
- Hey, Tiff, looking good today.
- Thanks.

658
00:57:13,223 --> 00:57:16,351
- Rap sheet on Bobby Stiggers.
- Thank you.

659
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:30,698
- So Hobbesy, tell me something.
- Shoot.

660
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:33,785
The other day you were
in the basement, uh, reading an old file.

661
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:35,787
Yeah. What about it?

662
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:39,332
It looked like there was some kind of map
in there. You go somewhere?

663
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:42,252
- I went up to the country.
- Yeah? It's great to get out of town.

664
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,629
- Lovely. Fresh air, you know?
- Yeah.

665
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:49,509
I used to do that. Go up to a house
in the mountains and sit by the water.

666
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:51,386
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

667
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,806
So I'm curious, uh, where'd you go?

668
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:58,268
Why do you ask, Lou?

669
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:02,105
Come here.

670
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:04,232
Come here.

671
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:06,276
Come on, come here.

672
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:13,700
<i>Time is on my side</i>

673
00:58:14,576 --> 00:58:16,202
<i>Yes, it is</i>

674
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,079
<i>Time...</i>

675
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,207
<i>ls on my side</i>

676
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:22,792
<i>Yes, it is</i>

677
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:24,252
- Lou?
- What?

678
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:30,508
<i>You're always saying
That you wanna be free</i>

679
00:58:30,717 --> 00:58:32,927
<i>But I'll come running back</i>

680
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:34,762
Mike.

681
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,683
Mike.

682
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:40,810
Mike?

683
00:58:43,021 --> 00:58:44,397
Yo, Mike.

684
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:46,274
Yeah, detective.

685
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,866
Why were you singing that song, huh?

686
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:56,868
- Song?
- Why were you singing that song?

687
00:58:57,577 --> 00:59:00,872
- I was singing?
- Why were you singing that song?

688
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,458
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't?

689
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,251
No, I don't.

690
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:07,295
You don't know what I'm talking about?

691
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:09,130
Uh-uh.

692
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,020
Hey. Hey!

693
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,522
Hey, you.

694
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:40,078
Syrian Aramaic?

695
00:59:40,787 --> 00:59:41,829
How clever.

696
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:44,415
- Jesus.
- Honey, is there some--?

697
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:50,463
It's true what I said though.
I do know who you are.

698
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:52,590
Azazel.

699
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,969
Where'd you get that?
From Milano's place?

700
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:58,638
You found something up there.

701
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:03,101
Well, some things, pal,
you shouldn't know.

702
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:04,978
Like what?

703
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:06,729
Like what?

704
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:11,109
If you know, you should never, ever tell.

705
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,370
Beware of my wrath.

706
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,293
H93'-

707
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:40,990
Well?

708
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,412
What were you doing just back then?

709
01:01:47,288 --> 01:01:49,540
- What are you talking about?
- With the singing.

710
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:51,417
You were singing.

711
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:54,462
- I wasn't singing.
- You were.

712
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:57,548
Lawrence was singing
and Mike was singing some '60s thing.

713
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:59,675
There you go.

714
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:03,888
I wasn't singing.
I hated the fucking '60s.

715
01:02:06,933 --> 01:02:08,893
I wasn't singing.

716
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,565
I appreciate your situation, okay?
I really do.

717
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:18,694
Your father, mother, they're dead.
Their lives were ruined. Your life is ruined.

718
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:20,113
I'm very sorry about that.

719
01:02:20,321 --> 01:02:24,492
But I gotta know what's going on, okay?
If this thing is what it seems to be...

720
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,954
...if this thing is what the book says
that it is, then...

721
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:39,006
- Is this for real? Do you believe this stuff?
- I believe more is hidden than is seen.

722
01:02:39,215 --> 01:02:40,466
Well, I believe what I see.

723
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:43,845
And I'm still trying to get my mind around
what I just saw, okay?

724
01:02:44,053 --> 01:02:46,931
Something threatened me.

725
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,934
And this Reese,
he threatened me in Aramaic.

726
01:02:50,143 --> 01:02:51,561
Wait, what else did Reese say?

727
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:55,231
Hey, I'm asking the questions here.
You answer the quest--

728
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,734
You answer the questions I ask, okay?
If I don't know what's going on--

729
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:02,029
We're not supposed to know.
We're not supposed to see.

730
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:04,907
It's like the Mafia. They don't even exist.

731
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:06,451
Okay, okay.

732
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:09,328
That's good. That's a start.
They don't even exist.

733
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:11,664
So where are they from?
Who the hell are they?

734
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:15,501
Mr. Hobbes,
there are certain phenomena...

735
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:19,130
...which can only be explained
if there is a God...

736
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:22,550
...and if there are angels.
And there are. They exist.

737
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,594
Some of these angels were cast down.

738
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:27,805
And a few of the fallen were punished
by being deprived of form.

739
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:31,350
They can only survive in the bodies
of others. It's inside of us.

740
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:34,312
Inside of human beings,
their vengeance is played out.

741
01:03:37,857 --> 01:03:39,317
That's it?

742
01:03:40,151 --> 01:03:41,777
Come on, get out of here.

743
01:03:42,612 --> 01:03:43,863
I mean, come on. What--?

744
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,157
I mean...

745
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:48,367
Miss Milano, I'm just a cop, okay?

746
01:03:48,618 --> 01:03:52,371
I'm a detective.
My work is based upon evidence, facts.

747
01:03:52,622 --> 01:03:54,332
Mine too. Mine too.

748
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:58,878
And aren't your facts here
rather resistant to normal interpretation?

749
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:04,008
So you're saying
that Edgar Reese is actually--

750
01:04:04,217 --> 01:04:06,886
At the time you knew him,
he was not himself.

751
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:09,222
- He was Azazel?
- Yes, Azazel.

752
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:12,058
Sadistic, left-handed, likes to sing.

753
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:14,852
Reese? Why does he focus in on me?

754
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:17,688
You got his attention
so he tried to get inside you.

755
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:18,981
He shook your hand.

756
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,985
That didn't work, so now he's gonna try
and find some other way.

757
01:04:24,946 --> 01:04:27,031
Like he did with your father?

758
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:33,246
Okay.

759
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:37,166
How do we fight him?
Is it even possible?

760
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,293
I believe it is. And I'm not alone.

761
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:43,422
There's a network. I don't even know
who they are. I just have numbers.

762
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:45,258
Okay, these people know the--

763
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:48,928
We believe that God limited demons
and made them mortal...

764
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:51,180
...and he put a few of us here
to fight them.

765
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:55,184
Us? Us who? Who us?

766
01:04:55,393 --> 01:04:57,436
You saying me? I'm one of these people?

767
01:04:57,603 --> 01:05:01,023
Ha. I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.

768
01:05:01,232 --> 01:05:03,401
You're just doing your job.

769
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:07,154
Okay. Touché.

770
01:05:07,363 --> 01:05:09,532
So these demons are mortal.
They can be killed.

771
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,284
- By the right person.
- Who?

772
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:13,828
This is religion, Mr. Hobbes. These are...

773
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:17,290
These are matters of fate and divine order.
The right man--

774
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:19,542
- Or woman.
- Yes.

775
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,294
- It could be you, me, anybody?
- Yes.

776
01:05:21,502 --> 01:05:24,839
The right person of the right character
with the right knowledge...

777
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:26,757
So this is what you've been doing.

778
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:30,261
This is what-- You've been preparing
for this, haven't you?

779
01:05:34,473 --> 01:05:36,642
Can I ask you something personal?

780
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:39,353
Everything's personal if you're a person.

781
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:42,440
Is this why you live alone?

782
01:05:43,608 --> 01:05:47,862
Well, there's a difference between
risking for yourself and someone else.

783
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:49,822
That's true.

784
01:05:50,031 --> 01:05:51,782
I mean, if I had someone...

785
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:55,077
...I'd wanna share my life and my thoughts
and my work with them.

786
01:05:55,286 --> 01:05:59,790
But if I shared this, I'd put them at risk
and I don't have a right to do that.

787
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:03,044
Well, you can talk to me.

788
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:06,797
You don't have to. I'm not saying that...
I'm not, you know...

789
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:11,719
Do whatever you wanna do. I'm just saying
you can, if you want to, you can talk to me.

790
01:06:12,428 --> 01:06:14,055
Thanks.

791
01:06:14,263 --> 01:06:16,974
That's a very nice thing to say.

792
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:21,520
I've got to go. I hope I've been helpful.

793
01:06:22,647 --> 01:06:24,690
- Thanks for listening.
- Okay. Thank you.

794
01:07:33,843 --> 01:07:36,804
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just about to tap you on the shoulder.

795
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:40,015
You're a friend of John Hobbes,
aren't you? Huh?

796
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:42,059
I'm Jay Reynolds.

797
01:07:43,853 --> 01:07:46,147
Uh-uh. You know.

798
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:48,816
Ooh. How lovely.

799
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:53,946
Hmm. You're not just Hobbes' chippy.

800
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,324
Have we met? You seem vaguely familiar.

801
01:07:57,658 --> 01:08:01,662
Mm. Come on, tell me.

802
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:03,873
I'm about to find out anyway.

803
01:08:10,588 --> 01:08:11,797
Foreplay. Ha, ha.

804
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:14,383
- Coming through. Watch out.
- Hey. No, you don't.

805
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,076
Please, help me!

806
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:44,872
Go! GO!

807
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,916
- 0

808
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:50,753
Go!

809
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:58,552
Jesus, man, you all right?

810
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:22,451
You all right?

811
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:30,125
Thanks for coming.

812
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:37,174
I ran.

813
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,219
He came after me and I ran.

814
01:09:43,264 --> 01:09:47,476
- Maybe you weren't ready yet.
- That's the point. You have to be ready.

815
01:09:48,269 --> 01:09:49,854
You know what it is?

816
01:09:51,522 --> 01:09:53,691
I never believed this day would come.

817
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:56,944
I thought God would make it up to me.
I'd be a good girl...

818
01:09:57,152 --> 01:09:59,947
...and God would show me
an angel instead.

819
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:04,034
Do they know who you are?

820
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,209
We shouldn't be seen together.

821
01:10:12,877 --> 01:10:14,753
Not any more.

822
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:22,511
Wipe your tears.

823
01:10:35,983 --> 01:10:37,985
- You wanted to see me, lieutenant?
- Yeah.

824
01:10:38,193 --> 01:10:41,113
- How you doing?
- Fine.

825
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:43,991
The murders not getting you wound up?

826
01:10:44,742 --> 01:10:47,703
You can bag the chocolates.
You ain't gotta talk to me sideways.

827
01:10:47,912 --> 01:10:49,496
What's up?

828
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:52,958
Where were you
when Muskavich and Noons were killed?

829
01:10:54,335 --> 01:10:57,671
Where was I? What? Am I a suspect?

830
01:10:58,631 --> 01:11:00,132
Sit down.

831
01:11:03,886 --> 01:11:06,513
Not to me, you're not, but...

832
01:11:06,764 --> 01:11:11,602
Look, lieutenant, you know, hey,
what is it, the phone records again?

833
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:14,897
What do they think? I committed
the murders, called my own house...

834
01:11:15,105 --> 01:11:17,149
...then I ran home
and answered my own phone?

835
01:11:17,358 --> 01:11:19,568
No, it's something else.

836
01:11:19,777 --> 01:11:20,945
Your prints.

837
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:24,198
MY prints? On what?

838
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,451
On that fucking little coin of yours.

839
01:11:28,077 --> 01:11:30,621
- Where?
- Noons' place.

840
01:11:39,838 --> 01:11:42,174
Oh, shit.

841
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:44,760
This is a frame-up.

842
01:11:45,386 --> 01:11:47,846
- Is it?
- Yeah. Anybody could have got those coins.

843
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:51,058
They could have got them, uh,
when I'm at the store or something.

844
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:56,063
- They could have taken them off my desk.
- We always said it could be a cop.

845
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:58,691
Yeah. We did always say that.

846
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:01,735
I'm not stupid, you know.

847
01:12:01,944 --> 01:12:05,656
I know you know more than you're saying.
So tell me.

848
01:12:09,326 --> 01:12:11,161
You don't really wanna know, lieutenant.

849
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:14,623
You'd have to be there.
I was there and I don't even wanna know.

850
01:12:14,832 --> 01:12:16,250
Try me.

851
01:12:22,131 --> 01:12:24,008
You remember Robert Milano?

852
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:28,804
No, wait, listen to me.
This is exactly what happened to him.

853
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:31,181
He was framed.

854
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:37,521
I'll give you some advice, okay?

855
01:12:38,147 --> 01:12:40,524
Let go of it for a couple hours.

856
01:12:40,733 --> 01:12:44,278
Go home, see your family.

857
01:12:44,486 --> 01:12:46,071
Take a load off.

858
01:12:53,829 --> 01:12:57,833
<i>The hell with Stanton.
The hell with all of them.</i>

859
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:00,836
<i>Nobody likes to get
the shit kicked out of them.</i>

860
01:13:01,045 --> 01:13:03,297
<i>Nobody likes to get hit from every angle.</i>

861
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:07,176
<i>But evil just keeps on coming.
You know what I mean?</i>

862
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:13,974
<i>You saw it before, but now it's in your face,
laughing at you.</i>

863
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:19,063
- Hi, unc.
- Hey, Sam.

864
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:22,816
- How you doing, Toby?
- Hi, Mr. Hobbes.

865
01:13:24,276 --> 01:13:26,236
- You're home early today.
- Yeah.

866
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,614
For a change.

867
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:57,810
Hey, Art, you move my address book?

868
01:13:58,018 --> 01:14:00,938
What? No. Um...

869
01:14:01,105 --> 01:14:02,773
What?

870
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:05,442
Art?

871
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:10,572
What's wrong with your eye?

872
01:14:15,369 --> 01:14:17,079
Who hit you in the eye?

873
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:19,164
I fell.

874
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,083
You fell?

875
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:24,378
I fell, or something.

876
01:14:24,586 --> 01:14:26,839
Art, people don't fall down
and get a black eye.

877
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:28,340
- No?
- No.

878
01:14:28,507 --> 01:14:30,092
Oh. Um...

879
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:34,763
All right, all right, all right.
It's okay, it's okay. Just, look...

880
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:37,349
What happened?

881
01:14:38,267 --> 01:14:39,518
Sammy hit me.

882
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:41,061
What?

883
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:44,314
It was an accident though.
He didn't mean to though.

884
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:46,567
<i>He didn't mean to</i>

885
01:14:48,193 --> 01:14:50,028
It was an accident. It was an accident.

886
01:14:50,237 --> 01:14:51,905
Uncle John. Uncle John.

887
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:53,532
Sam?

888
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,326
Where's Toby?

889
01:14:56,702 --> 01:14:58,954
Outside, I guess.

890
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:01,456
Okay, go back in the house.

891
01:15:08,422 --> 01:15:10,716
- Toby?
- Hey, Hobbes.

892
01:15:16,555 --> 01:15:18,432
You leave my family alone, you hear me?

893
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,392
- Uncle John.
- Go back in the house.

894
01:15:20,601 --> 01:15:22,644
- What's going on?
- Go back in the house!

895
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:30,694
- You leave my family alone.
- Why?

896
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:34,281
You come after me.
Now I come after you and yours.

897
01:15:56,762 --> 01:15:58,138
Hey.

898
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:01,808
- Toby, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

899
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:03,060
Go right home. Go.

900
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:04,937
- Okay, I will.
- Run.

901
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,963
What's the matter, pal?
Are you afraid to fight me?

902
01:16:32,089 --> 01:16:34,341
Come on, Hobbes. Come on out.

903
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,636
Come on, Hobbes. Come on.

904
01:16:38,345 --> 01:16:39,846
Put the gun down.

905
01:16:41,515 --> 01:16:42,557
I knew you'd come out.

906
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:44,434
Put the gun on the ground!

907
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:46,270
I know you, Hobbes.

908
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,021
Set the gun down, sir.

909
01:16:53,485 --> 01:16:55,112
Put the gun down!

910
01:18:04,389 --> 01:18:05,640
<i>Yes, it is</i>

911
01:18:06,516 --> 01:18:11,730
<i>Time is on my side</i>

912
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,857
Hey, pal.

913
01:18:14,733 --> 01:18:17,944
Wake up, Hobbes.
I'm not that easy to kill.

914
01:18:18,153 --> 01:18:22,657
When my host dies and I move as spirit,
no man can resist me.

915
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:26,912
What are you gonna do, arrest me?
What are you gonna tell Stanton?

916
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,247
I'd love to hear that one.

917
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:33,251
It's me you want, isn't it?
Why don't you just kill me, huh?

918
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:36,338
But I'm still having fun.

919
01:18:36,546 --> 01:18:39,216
Aren't you still having fun'?

920
01:19:29,599 --> 01:19:31,935
He was standing in the street,
yelling at him...

921
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:34,729
...shooting at him.
Finally, when the officer...

922
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:37,357
I guess that's it.

923
01:19:38,275 --> 01:19:39,317
We're back at...

924
01:19:39,651 --> 01:19:42,946
...the scene here of this...

925
01:19:45,282 --> 01:19:47,534
There's no question
that the dead man shot first?

926
01:19:47,742 --> 01:19:51,413
No question at all.
My wife saw it too, if you wanna ask her.

927
01:19:52,581 --> 01:19:55,375
- Lieutenant.
- A schoolteacher, huh?

928
01:19:57,461 --> 01:20:00,297
What am I gonna say?
What am I gonna do?

929
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:04,968
We know that he fired first.
Witnesses corroborate.

930
01:20:05,177 --> 01:20:08,722
But his gun was filled with blanks.
And he got the gun out of a stolen car.

931
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:10,599
- It was a setup.
- A setup?

932
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:12,350
That's right. A setup.

933
01:20:12,559 --> 01:20:14,436
- He set it up for you to kill him?
- Art.

934
01:20:14,644 --> 01:20:17,481
- Committed suicide by-- Ugh.
- Excuse me one second.

935
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:19,191
Art.

936
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:21,359
What the hell
are you doing out here, huh?

937
01:20:21,568 --> 01:20:24,613
You take Sam home, lock every door,
every window in the apartment.

938
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:27,115
You don't let anybody in. Nobody.
Can you do that?

939
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:29,951
- Can you remember that? All right, do it.
- Yeah.

940
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,786
- Johnny?
- Yeah?

941
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:34,956
Are you mad at me or something?

942
01:20:35,373 --> 01:20:37,792
No, Art. Never.

943
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:40,420
Just do what I told you.

944
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:47,594
Hate to see the mighty fall,
you know what I mean?

945
01:20:47,928 --> 01:20:51,014
Now it's letters. Fuck you, Lou.

946
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,308
Lieutenant, I told you, it's a cult.

947
01:20:53,767 --> 01:20:57,521
Some weird, psycho,
Aramaic-Satanist reincarnation cult.

948
01:20:58,146 --> 01:20:59,856
He's got A-P-O written on his chest.

949
01:21:00,106 --> 01:21:02,609
He's trying to send
some kind of message.

950
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:08,949
The killer's sending a message.

951
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:11,117
Hobbes...

952
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:14,579
...this time, you are the killer.

953
01:21:16,122 --> 01:21:18,792
- Yeah, sort of.
- No fucking "sort of."

954
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,545
No breaks. No benefit of the doubt.

955
01:21:21,753 --> 01:21:25,215
We're going back to the precinct. Now.

956
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:38,728
Tonight, another
very shocking murder in the city.

957
01:21:38,937 --> 01:21:41,773
A well-respected schoolteacher
apparently opened fire...

958
01:21:41,982 --> 01:21:44,901
...on an off-duty police officer tonight.
Police say the officer...

959
01:21:45,235 --> 01:21:48,196
<i>...John Hobbes, was forced to return fire.</i>

960
01:21:48,405 --> 01:21:50,323
<i>Our report now, from the scene.</i>

961
01:21:50,532 --> 01:21:54,286
<i>We're on the scene
of a most unusual homicide tonight.</i>

962
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:56,204
Close the door.

963
01:21:56,413 --> 01:21:59,541
<i>Detective John Hobbes shot and killed
a high-school math teacher.</i>

964
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:01,876
<i>The police have not yet identified
this man.</i>

965
01:22:02,127 --> 01:22:03,670
Okay.

966
01:22:09,009 --> 01:22:11,803
I talked to the schoolteacher's wife.

967
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:13,471
He got married four months ago.

968
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,016
She's pregnant. He just got a raise.

969
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:18,935
So much for suicide by cop.

970
01:22:24,733 --> 01:22:27,068
The shooting team will need your gun.

971
01:22:27,652 --> 01:22:29,988
I'll get the hearing as soon as I can.

972
01:22:31,323 --> 01:22:33,116
People want the world to make sense.

973
01:22:33,325 --> 01:22:38,330
If the only way I can get the world
to make sense for me is to arrest you...

974
01:22:38,538 --> 01:22:40,665
...then I'll have to do it.

975
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:46,588
Get the fuck out of here.

976
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:31,341
- It was a clean shoot.
- Yeah, I know.

977
01:23:31,549 --> 01:23:33,426
It doesn't help, but I know.

978
01:23:35,053 --> 01:23:37,931
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

979
01:23:38,139 --> 01:23:39,265
You wanna talk?

980
01:23:39,474 --> 01:23:42,686
From where I sit, we're dealing with shit
that ain't in the manual.

981
01:23:45,814 --> 01:23:49,818
Where do they buy coffee with dirt in it?
Can you tell me that?

982
01:23:54,072 --> 01:23:56,116
What's the point of life, huh, Jonesy?

983
01:23:57,117 --> 01:23:59,994
- The point?
- Yeah.

984
01:24:01,496 --> 01:24:03,623
- Of life?
- Yeah.

985
01:24:06,251 --> 01:24:09,295
- The point of life. You want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.

986
01:24:12,757 --> 01:24:15,218
The point of life is we catch bad guys.

987
01:24:15,427 --> 01:24:17,721
Yeah. That's what I used to think.

988
01:24:19,347 --> 01:24:20,682
It's not good enough, Jonesy.

989
01:24:21,141 --> 01:24:23,184
You can shoot me for talking like this but--

990
01:24:23,393 --> 01:24:26,896
Hey, it's 2:00 in the morning.
You can talk any way you want.

991
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:32,819
What are we doing here?
You know what I'm saying?

992
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:36,030
Why do we even exist? Us?

993
01:24:37,574 --> 01:24:39,659
Maybe it's God, Hobbes.

994
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:42,328
Yeah, it could be.

995
01:24:44,748 --> 01:24:47,625
I have a hard time believing...

996
01:24:48,126 --> 01:24:52,464
...that we're part of some huge
moral experiment, you know...

997
01:24:52,672 --> 01:24:54,966
...conducted by a greater being than us.

998
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:57,552
I mean, if there's a greater being
than we are...

999
01:24:57,761 --> 01:24:59,512
...why does he give a shit about us?

1000
01:24:59,721 --> 01:25:03,808
There's five billion of us. We're like ants.
I mean, do we care what ants do...

1001
01:25:04,017 --> 01:25:07,312
...you know, from a moral standpoint?
- Ants? No.

1002
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,063
- Right. 80--
- I'm following you...

1003
01:25:09,314 --> 01:25:11,566
...but at the same time I'm losing you.
- I know.

1004
01:25:11,775 --> 01:25:15,487
- I mean, are you heading someplace here?
- That's my point.

1005
01:25:15,862 --> 01:25:17,447
Are we headed someplace?

1006
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:20,325
If we don't figure it out...

1007
01:25:22,452 --> 01:25:24,621
Maybe if you figure it out...

1008
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,373
...you die.

1009
01:25:27,582 --> 01:25:30,585
Heart attack, stroke.
You figure out what's what...

1010
01:25:31,336 --> 01:25:34,631
...you don't get to hang around any more.
You get promoted.

1011
01:25:36,549 --> 01:25:38,927
Meanwhile, Delores...

1012
01:25:39,677 --> 01:25:41,679
...she says we're put here to do one thing.

1013
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:43,348
One thing?

1014
01:25:43,973 --> 01:25:45,600
- What's that?
- It's different.

1015
01:25:45,767 --> 01:25:47,393
It's, uh, different for everybody.

1016
01:25:47,602 --> 01:25:48,937
Hers is lasagna.

1017
01:25:49,145 --> 01:25:50,688
Lasagna?

1018
01:25:51,564 --> 01:25:53,525
And just one thing, not two or three or--?

1019
01:25:53,733 --> 01:25:57,111
Maybe two, I don't know.
It's just her opinion, Hobbes.

1020
01:25:57,403 --> 01:25:58,905
But it's like...

1021
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:02,659
...when a moment comes...

1022
01:26:03,451 --> 01:26:05,829
...we either do the right thing...

1023
01:26:06,579 --> 01:26:07,664
...or wrong.

1024
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:11,876
And when do you know
when your moment comes?

1025
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:26,641
- So, like, this could be it for me?
- That's the beauty. You never know.

1026
01:26:29,269 --> 01:26:31,771
- Hello?
- John? Is that you?

1027
01:26:33,273 --> 01:26:34,649
- Yeah.
- Hi.

1028
01:26:34,858 --> 01:26:37,694
- I just wanted to see if you were okay.
- Yeah.

1029
01:26:37,902 --> 01:26:40,446
Let me, uh... I'll call you back.
I'll call you later.

1030
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:42,365
Okay.

1031
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:50,498
That was the killer.
We're gonna arrange things later.

1032
01:27:03,344 --> 01:27:05,054
I'm going home.

1033
01:27:05,972 --> 01:27:07,932
Yeah, fuck it.

1034
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:25,992
<i>I killed someone.
He got me to kill an innocent man.</i>

1035
01:27:26,409 --> 01:27:27,744
<i>I know.</i>

1036
01:27:27,994 --> 01:27:29,829
<i>What do they want, Gretta?</i>

1037
01:27:30,496 --> 01:27:33,917
<i>- Just tell me what they want.
- The demons?</i>

1038
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:39,047
<i>They want the fall of civilization.
The fall of Babylon, " as they put it</i>

1039
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:41,966
<i>- The whole thing?
- Yeah.</i>

1040
01:27:42,175 --> 01:27:44,886
<i>Hell, they're doing a good job, aren't they?</i>

1041
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:49,807
<i>You know, after I shot the teacher,
Azazel moved to someone else.</i>

1042
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:52,644
<i>Are you sure? After death?</i>

1043
01:27:52,852 --> 01:27:55,271
<i>I'm positive. After death. Yeah, I saw it.</i>

1044
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,648
<i>Oh, yeah, listen to this.</i>

1045
01:27:56,898 --> 01:27:59,692
<i>I was looking through
one of your father's books...</i>

1046
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:05,365
<i>...and it</i> says, uh, "outside--"
I guess that means outside the body.

1047
01:28:05,573 --> 01:28:09,243
<i>"Outside, they can survive
for one breath only."</i>

1048
01:28:09,452 --> 01:28:13,498
<i>There's a Hebrew text says
the breath can carry them for 500 cubits.</i>

1049
01:28:13,706 --> 01:28:15,208
<i>I never knew what it meant.</i>

1050
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:17,835
<i>A cubit, that's a distance
or something, right?</i>

1051
01:28:18,044 --> 01:28:19,963
<i>Yeah. From your elbow to your fingertips.</i>

1052
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:24,217
<i>So 500 cubits would be what?
About a sixth of a mile?</i>

1053
01:28:24,425 --> 01:28:26,761
<i>Yeah, well, you're right then. They,</i> uh...

1054
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:30,014
I guess they are limited in certain ways.

1055
01:28:32,433 --> 01:28:33,810
What are you thinking?

1056
01:28:35,061 --> 01:28:36,688
I don't know.

1057
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:41,192
I don't know. You okay?

1058
01:28:42,068 --> 01:28:43,319
Yeah.

1059
01:28:43,695 --> 01:28:45,071
<i>All right. Well, then,</i> uh...

1060
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,533
...maybe I'll check up on you tomorrow.

1061
01:28:51,035 --> 01:28:53,788
- Good night.
- Good night.

1062
01:29:17,228 --> 01:29:18,771
Good morning, Sam.

1063
01:29:19,814 --> 01:29:22,442
- Good morning, Sam.
- Oh, hi, Uncle John.

1064
01:29:22,692 --> 01:29:23,818
Oh, hi.

1065
01:29:24,027 --> 01:29:27,613
- Thanks for tucking me in last night.
- You're welcome.

1066
01:29:29,574 --> 01:29:31,909
<i>We sent Michael Aaron out to the scene...</i>

1067
01:29:32,118 --> 01:29:34,746
<i>...where he'll be ready
with a live report shortly.</i>

1068
01:29:34,954 --> 01:29:37,165
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

1069
01:30:24,712 --> 01:30:26,339
Sam?

1070
01:30:27,799 --> 01:30:31,219
Sam? You were asleep last night
when I tucked you in, weren't you?

1071
01:30:32,095 --> 01:30:35,640
I don't know. All I remember
was somebody tickling me.

1072
01:30:35,848 --> 01:30:37,141
Tickling my chest.

1073
01:30:43,231 --> 01:30:45,441
Why'd you write that?

1074
01:30:47,485 --> 01:30:49,320
- Where's your father?
- In the bedroom.

1075
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:51,489
He's a sleepyhead.

1076
01:30:56,452 --> 01:30:59,497
<i>If you watched
the national news just last week...</i>

1077
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:02,041
<i>you might have seen
a similar case in Boston...</i>

1078
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:04,877
<i>...of a decorated cop accused of murder.</i>

1079

01:31:10,299 --> 01:31:11,342
Art?

Art?

Art?

<i>Stop that clowning around, Scooby.</i>

1084
01:33:21,764 --> 01:33:24,100
- Hello.
- Hey, have you seen the news?

1085
01:33:25,059 --> 01:33:28,437
<i>The cop was shooting first.
And he kept on shooting.</i>

1086
01:33:28,646 --> 01:33:31,065
- Yeah.
- Our friend Lou's coming to get you.

1087
01:33:31,315 --> 01:33:33,484
He's gonna bring you down
for more conversation.

1088
01:33:33,693 --> 01:33:35,152
- Lou?
- No.

1089
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:37,780
- They get him yet?
- No. Not yet.

1090
01:33:39,365 --> 01:33:42,034
- Yeah, I gotta go.
- Okay.

1091
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:47,415
<i>Well, I heard shouting</i>

1092
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:21,198
Sam, here. Put these clothes on.
Get dressed right away.

1093
01:34:21,449 --> 01:34:23,534
- Why?
- Just do what I tell you, please!

1094
01:34:33,544 --> 01:34:37,006
- Sam, you ready?
- Yeah, almost. What's going on here?

1095
01:34:37,214 --> 01:34:39,050
We're just gonna play...

1096
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,886
...a little trick on somebody.
- Cool.

1097
01:34:47,141 --> 01:34:48,976
No, we're, uh, going out the window.

1098
01:34:52,229 --> 01:34:54,148
What about my dad?

1099
01:34:55,566 --> 01:34:58,611
He's, uh, sleeping. He's still asleep.

1100
01:35:45,741 --> 01:35:48,244
Excuse me, Sister. How you doing?

1101
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:49,954
- Good.
- Good.

1102
01:35:50,121 --> 01:35:54,083
Uh, does "apocalypse," uh--
That mean anything to you?

1103
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:55,751
Sure it does.

1104
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:59,088
"Apocalypse" was the Greek word
for "revelation."

1105
01:35:59,296 --> 01:36:00,756
Revelation.

1106
01:36:01,757 --> 01:36:04,093
- You mean like the book of the Bible?
- Yes.

1107
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:07,388
- Revelation. All right. Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

1108
01:36:37,418 --> 01:36:39,420
- Give me a, uh, pack of cigarettes.
- Sure.

1109
01:36:39,628 --> 01:36:41,422
- Any special kind?
- No, any kind.

1110
01:36:42,339 --> 01:36:44,758
Okay, out of 5.

1111
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:48,846
Detective Hobbes?

1112
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:50,806
Sir, you forgot your change.

1113
01:36:51,015 --> 01:36:52,516
Detective Hobbes.

1114
01:36:52,725 --> 01:36:54,685
Detective, hold up. I wanna talk to you.

1115
01:36:55,769 --> 01:36:57,438
Hey.

1116
01:36:58,439 --> 01:36:59,648
- Go, Sam. Run.
- Okay, okay.

1117
01:36:59,857 --> 01:37:01,859
Down the stairs, down the stairs.
Go, go.

1118
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:03,402
All units in the area--

1119
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:44,818
Why don't you close that coat up?

1120
01:37:57,581 --> 01:37:58,958
Cigarettes?

1121
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:01,835
I thought you quit.
I thought they were bad for you.

1122
01:38:02,044 --> 01:38:04,088
I did quit and they are bad for you.

1123
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:09,843
You know what's going on, son?

1124
01:38:14,306 --> 01:38:18,185
The police think that, uh,
I did some bad things.

1125
01:38:19,562 --> 01:38:21,689
- You are the police.
- Not any more.

1126
01:38:22,982 --> 01:38:26,527
- Well, why do they think you did that?
- Well, because...

1127
01:38:27,361 --> 01:38:29,280
Because somebody, uh...

1128
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:31,657
...made it look like I did.

1129
01:38:32,658 --> 01:38:35,035
I once saw that on a show.

1130
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:47,298
I wanna talk to you
about something else too.

1131
01:38:48,048 --> 01:38:49,174
About your dad.

1132
01:38:53,387 --> 01:38:55,347
He's not asleep, is he?

1133
01:38:59,101 --> 01:39:01,020
No, son. He's not asleep.

1134
01:39:03,105 --> 01:39:04,898
Did it hurt?

1135
01:39:08,027 --> 01:39:09,278
I don't think so.

1136
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:13,741
- Do you think he's gonna go to heaven?
- Yes.

1137
01:39:14,491 --> 01:39:15,951
Yes, I do.

1138
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:18,370
Anybody deserves to go to heaven,
it's your dad.

1139
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:23,876
I think so too.

1140
01:39:54,948 --> 01:39:56,200
We got no place else to go.

1141
01:39:57,076 --> 01:39:58,827
This is my nephew, Sam.

1142
01:40:00,579 --> 01:40:02,539
Okay. Hi, Sam.

1143
01:40:02,748 --> 01:40:04,667
- Nice to meet you. I'm Gretta.
- Hi.

1144
01:40:07,544 --> 01:40:09,380
You're in your pajamas.

1145
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:12,675
I wasn't expecting company,
but I'm glad you're here.

1146
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:20,182
Why don't you, uh, go over there
by the fireplace and get warm, huh?

1147
01:40:20,766 --> 01:40:22,643
Azazel wrote on his chest.

1148
01:40:22,851 --> 01:40:25,062
Unless I do something, he's gonna--

1149
01:40:26,397 --> 01:40:29,525
- I'll get you a coffee.
- Thank you.

1150
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:35,382
I think I got my mind
around this thing now, but let me...

1151
01:41:35,591 --> 01:41:38,218
...let me run this by you, okay?

1152
01:41:38,594 --> 01:41:41,346
After the host body dies...

1153
01:41:41,555 --> 01:41:44,683
...the demon can survive
for one breath or 500 cubits, right?

1154
01:41:44,892 --> 01:41:46,268
- Right.
- At the same time...

1155
01:41:46,477 --> 01:41:50,564
...Azazel says to me,
when he moves as spirit, no man can resist.

1156
01:41:50,814 --> 01:41:53,984
Somebody he can't get into by touch,
he can still get into by spirit.

1157
01:41:54,193 --> 01:41:58,572
Because, if when he's in spirit form...

1158
01:41:58,781 --> 01:42:03,160
...he's fighting for his life,
he's gonna be that much more powerful.

1159
01:42:06,497 --> 01:42:08,832
Please tell me what you're gonna do.

1160
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:10,876
Whatever <i>I</i> do...

1161
01:42:11,084 --> 01:42:15,714
<i>...I have to make sure
that you and Sam are safe.</i>

1162
01:42:16,381 --> 01:42:20,469
<i>Will you take him somewhere
nobody knows about?</i>

1163
01:42:20,677 --> 01:42:22,679
<i>Even me.</i>

1164
01:42:34,024 --> 01:42:36,318
Sam, wake up.

1165
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:39,196
Listen, uh...

1166
01:42:41,365 --> 01:42:42,574
I gotta go.

1167
01:42:43,867 --> 01:42:46,453
You're gonna stay with Gretta
for a little while.

1168
01:42:46,662 --> 01:42:48,831
Maybe for a long while.

1169
01:42:50,207 --> 01:42:52,292
Now, I want you to remember this:

1170
01:42:52,543 --> 01:42:55,170
Whatever people say about me...

1171
01:42:56,338 --> 01:42:58,549
...or whatever I do...

1172
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:02,803
...I just want you to remember
that I'm doing it for you.

1173
01:43:03,554 --> 01:43:05,347
Because I love you.

1174
01:43:06,223 --> 01:43:07,724
You understand?

1175
01:43:12,062 --> 01:43:14,731
I'm gonna go back to sleep...

1176
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:19,361
...and when I wake up,
everything is gonna be just the way it was.

1177
01:43:55,731 --> 01:43:57,107
Thank you.

1178
01:43:59,318 --> 01:44:00,903
You know what this means, right?

1179
01:44:03,196 --> 01:44:04,948
I'm ready.

1180
01:44:43,654 --> 01:44:46,448
- Hey, Jonesy, how you doing?
- Look, I'm worried, <i>man.</i>

1181
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,743
What you gonna do?
Where are you gonna go?

1182
01:44:49,952 --> 01:44:51,787
I'm going nowhere. I'm, uh...

1183
01:44:52,371 --> 01:44:55,040
I'm taking a long drive...

1184
01:44:55,374 --> 01:44:56,833
...where nobody will find me...

1185
01:44:57,668 --> 01:45:00,337
<i>...and, uh, sit by the water and think.</i>

1186
01:45:00,712 --> 01:45:02,756
<i>Hobbes, I gotta ask you something.</i>

1187
01:45:02,965 --> 01:45:04,633
Yeah, shoot.

1188
01:45:04,841 --> 01:45:06,885
<i>We've been partners a long time.</i>

1189
01:45:07,094 --> 01:45:10,222
Twelve plus, Jonesy. Twelve plus.

1190
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:14,184
<i>So, uh,
was there anything you gotta tell me?</i>

1191
01:45:14,726 --> 01:45:18,355
Yeah, remember what
we were talking about the other night?

1192
01:45:18,897 --> 01:45:22,442
When the moment comes, you know it.

1193
01:45:24,486 --> 01:45:26,697
<i>Be careful, okay?</i>

1194
01:45:26,947 --> 01:45:30,492
<i>- I'll</i> see you, partner.
- Yeah, you too

1195
01:45:30,701 --> 01:45:32,494
Be good.

1196
01:46:02,482 --> 01:46:04,860
<i>You're probably wondering
What am I doing?</i>

1197
01:46:05,068 --> 01:46:09,156
<i>Well, this is where things get
a little tricky.</i>

1198
01:46:09,364 --> 01:46:11,783
<i>It's just him and me now.</i>

1199
01:46:11,992 --> 01:46:15,078
<i>Hobbes versus Azazel.</i>

1200
01:46:16,455 --> 01:46:20,333
<i>I thought I had him.
But he thought he had me too.</i>

1201
01:48:15,699 --> 01:48:19,286
Come on out. I know you're here.

1202
01:48:20,745 --> 01:48:22,789
I knew you'd come.

1203
01:48:33,592 --> 01:48:35,969
Haven't you done enough, huh?

1204
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:41,725
You made me kill an innocent man.

1205
01:48:44,728 --> 01:48:46,438
You murdered my brother.

1206
01:48:47,606 --> 01:48:50,025
Come on out, you son of a bitch!

1207
01:48:50,692 --> 01:48:53,028
How much more fun can you have, huh?

1208
01:48:57,490 --> 01:49:00,202
Jesus, Hobbes.

1209
01:49:00,952 --> 01:49:03,371
What are you talking about?

1210
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:07,626
I didn't do any of that.

1211
01:49:09,169 --> 01:49:13,506
Me, I'm the poor schmo
they sent up here to bring you in.

1212
01:49:15,508 --> 01:49:17,135
So it's you now, huh?

1213
01:49:17,344 --> 01:49:21,348
It's me. Who'd you expect it to be?

1214
01:49:21,932 --> 01:49:24,434
Now drop your gun, Hobbes.

1215
01:49:24,643 --> 01:49:26,436
I know you got one.

1216
01:49:27,062 --> 01:49:30,774
Or what? You'll shoot me?

1217
01:49:31,733 --> 01:49:33,109
Where is the fun in that, huh?

1218
01:49:33,944 --> 01:49:35,528
Fuck you, huh?

1219
01:49:35,904 --> 01:49:37,739
You're making me do this.

1220
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:40,700
Now, drop the goddamn gun.

1221
01:49:40,909 --> 01:49:42,953
Do what he says, Hobbes.

1222
01:49:47,332 --> 01:49:49,042
Jonesy.

1223
01:50:00,553 --> 01:50:02,472
So who else is out here, huh?

1224
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:04,266
Lou? Tiff? Come on out!

1225
01:50:04,474 --> 01:50:06,184
No, it's just the two of us.

1226
01:50:09,813 --> 01:50:10,855
The gun, Hobbes.

1227
01:50:37,966 --> 01:50:39,884
Jonesy, you know I didn't do this.

1228
01:50:40,802 --> 01:50:43,221
You know I didn't do any of it.

1229
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:44,848
I know that, Hobbes.

1230
01:50:45,056 --> 01:50:48,768
We both wanna believe you, Hobbes,
but we gotta bring you in.

1231
01:51:01,614 --> 01:51:03,283
Stan.

1232
01:51:04,034 --> 01:51:05,410
I don't know if I can do this.

1233
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:08,955
What the fuck you talking?

1234
01:51:09,873 --> 01:51:14,544
Say Hobbes disappears into the woods,
we drive his car into the lake.

1235
01:51:14,753 --> 01:51:16,629
End of story. What's wrong with that?

1236
01:51:16,838 --> 01:51:19,799
We bring the son of a bitch in.
That's why we're up here.

1237
01:51:20,008 --> 01:51:23,136
He did it, fine.
He didn't do it, even better.

1238
01:51:23,345 --> 01:51:27,140
But it's not our job to decide.
Now drop the goddamn gun.

1239
01:51:31,436 --> 01:51:33,188
Jonesy?

1240
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,317
Put the goddamn gun down.

1241
01:51:47,535 --> 01:51:49,287
Okay.

1242
01:51:58,296 --> 01:52:00,173
Okay.

1243
01:52:04,677 --> 01:52:06,179
Thank you.

1244
01:52:11,059 --> 01:52:13,019
- I'm sorry, Stan.
- Oh, yeah.

1245
01:52:13,228 --> 01:52:16,981
Been on the force so many years, you think
you've seen it all, but you haven't.

1246
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:19,651
- Life always gives you one more surprise.
- One more.

1247
01:52:26,574 --> 01:52:27,951
Sometimes it's a big one.

1248
01:52:29,369 --> 01:52:33,456
- Azazel.
- Hey, I'm your partner, man.

1249
01:52:33,665 --> 01:52:34,999
Go on, you're free. Run.

1250
01:52:36,835 --> 01:52:38,211
Keep thinking, Hobbes.

1251
01:52:43,591 --> 01:52:44,926
How about that, huh?

1252
01:52:46,219 --> 01:52:49,097
Jonesy's fucked. He just killed his boss.

1253
01:52:51,099 --> 01:52:54,436
Jonesy's fucked. You're fucked.

1254
01:52:54,644 --> 01:52:56,229
One at a time, huh?

1255
01:52:56,479 --> 01:52:58,898
That's how we do it. One by one.

1256
01:53:00,233 --> 01:53:02,610
Olly olly oxen free.

1257
01:53:04,487 --> 01:53:10,118
<i>Time is on my side</i>

1258
01:53:10,577 --> 01:53:12,704
<i>Yes, it is</i>

1259
01:53:12,912 --> 01:53:17,000
<i>Time is on my side</i>

1260
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:19,294
You like the Stones, Hobbes?

1261
01:53:19,502 --> 01:53:23,590
I bet you didn't,
you big Monkee-fan pussy.

1262
01:53:28,052 --> 01:53:29,179
Time's up.

1263
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:32,724
See the deal?

1264
01:53:33,683 --> 01:53:36,019
If I kill you

1265
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:41,816
...it's just the final pathetic chapter...

1266
01:53:42,025 --> 01:53:44,986
...in the life of a disgraced hero.

1267
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:48,865
Just one more piece-of-shit human scum.

1268
01:53:50,617 --> 01:53:53,953
But turn it around.

1269
01:53:54,954 --> 01:53:56,956
If I die...

1270
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,254
...I enter you...

1271
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:05,924
...put 20 more murders on your tab...

1272
01:54:06,716 --> 01:54:09,052
...before you go down.

1273
01:54:10,428 --> 01:54:17,310
Maybe your nephew
or that chippy you were talking to.

1274
01:54:18,269 --> 01:54:20,897
How you wanna do this, huh?
I die, you die?

1275
01:54:21,105 --> 01:54:23,066
What's maximum fun, huh?
Can you guess...

1276
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:27,570
...what maximum fun is?

1277
01:54:28,279 --> 01:54:30,198
Sure you can.

1278
01:54:31,533 --> 01:54:33,868
Now that I've played you
from the outside...

1279
01:54:34,077 --> 01:54:36,287
...maximum fun is...

1280
01:54:36,496 --> 01:54:38,831
...I become you.

1281
01:55:11,531 --> 01:55:14,576
Oh, you got me, Hobbes.
You got me good.

1282
01:55:16,619 --> 01:55:18,955
But I gotta ask you something.

1283
01:55:19,330 --> 01:55:21,624
You wouldn't let me kill myself.
Why is that?

1284
01:55:22,333 --> 01:55:23,793
Because I need more time.

1285
01:55:24,002 --> 01:55:25,712
Time for what, asshole?

1286
01:55:27,672 --> 01:55:30,258
Five hundred cubits.
That's a long way, Azazel.

1287
01:55:31,092 --> 01:55:35,555
If Jonesy dies too fast,
as powerful as you are...

1288
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:37,807
...I might never get away from you.

1289
01:55:38,308 --> 01:55:41,019
Oh, he's catching on.

1290
01:55:41,227 --> 01:55:43,396
What? You think you're gonna win
this thing?

1291
01:55:44,814 --> 01:55:45,940
God willing.

1292
01:55:52,864 --> 01:55:54,991
You never know.

1293
01:56:01,581 --> 01:56:03,082
Let me ask you something.

1294
01:56:08,338 --> 01:56:10,423
Why do you think...

1295
01:56:10,923 --> 01:56:15,053
...Milano came all the way out here...

1296
01:56:15,261 --> 01:56:16,638
...in the middle of nowhere?

1297
01:56:16,846 --> 01:56:19,015
To die, the little chickenshit.

1298
01:56:20,683 --> 01:56:21,893
I don't think so.

1299
01:56:23,603 --> 01:56:27,774
I think that he wanted to do
what I'm gonna do.

1300
01:56:28,566 --> 01:56:31,611
- Only he couldn't pull it off.
- Pull what off?

1301
01:56:31,819 --> 01:56:33,905
Oh, come on, Azazel.

1302
01:56:34,572 --> 01:56:38,117
Open your eyes, huh?

1303
01:56:38,326 --> 01:56:39,744
Look around sometime.

1304
01:56:40,703 --> 01:56:43,790
Here we are in this beautiful place...

1305
01:56:44,624 --> 01:56:47,835
...not another human being
around for miles.

1306
01:56:48,419 --> 01:56:49,921
It's just you and me.

1307
01:56:58,596 --> 01:57:01,224
What is this? You don't smoke any more.

1308
01:57:06,729 --> 01:57:09,023
That's right. I don't.

1309
01:57:09,732 --> 01:57:10,858
You know why?

1310
01:57:14,195 --> 01:57:15,905
Because cigarettes kill.

1311
01:57:18,449 --> 01:57:20,993
Especially cigarettes laced with poison.

1312
01:57:23,496 --> 01:57:25,164
Bullshit.

1313
01:57:26,416 --> 01:57:29,419
Same poison that you used
to kill my brother.

1314
01:57:33,381 --> 01:57:34,841
Fuck you.

1315
01:57:35,925 --> 01:57:37,927
It's beautiful, isn't it'?

1316
01:57:38,136 --> 01:57:39,679
Isn't it so sweet?

1317
01:57:40,346 --> 01:57:44,058
We die together, just you and me.

1318
01:57:51,190 --> 01:57:57,780
<i>Time is on my side</i>

1319
01:57:59,115 --> 01:58:00,575
<i>Yes, it is</i>

1320
01:58:00,825 --> 01:58:02,869
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1321
01:58:12,545 --> 01:58:14,172
I'm sorry, Jonesy.

1322
01:58:27,852 --> 01:58:29,645
I'm sorry.

1323
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:36,337
<i>So like I said at the start...</i>

1324
01:59:36,546 --> 01:59:40,842
<i>...I was beaten, outsmarted, poisoned...</i>

1325
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:44,595
<i>...by Detective John Hobbes.</i>

1326
01:59:55,022 --> 01:59:59,360
<i>Can you imagine what it feels like
to be alive for thousands of years...</i>

1327
01:59:59,569 --> 02:00:02,363
<i>...and realize
you're actually going to die...</i>

1328
02:00:02,572 --> 02:00:07,827
<i>because some self-righteous cop decided
he was going to save the fucking world?</i>

1329
02:00:09,829 --> 02:00:12,123
<i>Yes, a demon can die...</i>

1330
02:00:12,331 --> 02:00:15,835
<i>...and Hobbes figured out
how to beat me at my own game.</i>

1331
02:00:16,043 --> 02:00:17,920
<i>So what?</i>

1332
02:00:18,838 --> 02:00:22,341
<i>The war isn't over, I promise you</i>

1333
02:00:22,550 --> 02:00:24,844
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

1334
02:00:39,734 --> 02:00:45,156
<i>Oh. You forgot something, didn't you?</i>

1335
02:00:46,407 --> 02:00:48,784
<i>At the beginning I said
I was going to tell you...</i>

1336
02:00:49,035 --> 02:00:53,456
<i>...about the time I almost died.</i>

1337
02:00:59,503 --> 02:01:01,422
<i>See you around.</i>

1337

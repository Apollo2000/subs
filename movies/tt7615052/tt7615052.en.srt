2
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:38,142
You alone?

3
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:39,810
I am.

4
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:41,046
You bring the money?

5
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,880
Where is my son?

6
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:44,084
Money first!

7
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:53,190
Look.

8
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:54,094
Your boy's alive...

9
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:56,827
for now...

10
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:58,565
but we need to see the money.

11
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:02,200
We all want this
to go the same way.

12
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:03,668
No one gets hurt.

13
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,736
I held up
to my end of the agreement.

14
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:06,705
Now you hold up to yours.

15
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:07,238
You want to see

16
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,873
your boy again,

17
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,909
then you'll do as you're told.

18
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,844
Otherwise, you're going
to have no one to blame

19
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:13,714
but yourself.

20
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:16,681
It's a chance
you're going to have to take.

21
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:17,618
Show us the money!

22
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,618
We had a deal.

23
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,589
Deals change.

24
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:54,856
It's all there?

25
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,625
Yeah, looks it.

26
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:00,894
Do it.

27
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:02,897
Do it now.

28
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:16,043
Keep the mask on!

29
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:21,916
Come on! Get in.

30
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,918
Cover me.

31
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,824
Come on.

32
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:41,702
Get in, get in!

33
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:11,328
What the hell was that?

34
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,931
Huh?

35
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,099
You were going to kill her?

36
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,133
That was the plan.

37
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:16,868
What do you mean
that was the plan?

38
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,801
Whose fucking plan was that?

39
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:18,972
Huh?

40
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,173
What about the kid?

41
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:23,110
Father's already got a buyer.

42
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,759
Go! Go! Go! Go!

43
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:46,733
- Just lose her already.
- Okay! Okay!

44
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:58,311
Hold on!

45
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,748
Shit.

46
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:21,334
Shit.

47
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:30,977
Shit.

48
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:15,409
Clair, I'm so sorry
about your father.

49
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:34,995
Charlie!

50
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:00,083
Let me go!

51
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,354
Wait! We need
to talk about this.

52
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:03,356
Let me go!

53
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,632
I'm going for a run.

54
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:17,434
Wanna come?

55
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:18,404
No.

56
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,564
<i>You were never here
when I needed you!</i>

57
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:51,237
<i>Charlie?</i>

58
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,477
<i>Charlie?</i>

59
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:11,425
Charlie!

60
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:19,630
Hello?

61
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:21,332
<i>Clair Hamilton?</i>

62
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:22,733
<i>We have your boy,</i>

63
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,736
<i>and if you ever want
to see him again,</i>

64
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,739
<i>I suggest you keep this
to yourself.</i>

65
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,374
<i>We'll be in touch, Clair.</i>

66
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:31,245
No, no, no. Wait.

67
00:14:34,147 --> 00:14:35,349
<i>Mom!</i>

68
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:45,775
Look at me.

69
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:47,345
Look at me!

70
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:49,283
Where is my son?

71
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:52,482
If you pull that trigger,

72
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:53,686
you're never
going to see him again.

73
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,373
Where is he?

74
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:16,642
He's...

75
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:19,346
up there.

76
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:55,167
Get back!

77
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:01,141
Get lost!

78
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,743
Get back! Stay away!

79
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,329
You did good, boy.

80
00:25:24,095 --> 00:25:26,132
Most young people
would have run.

81
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,069
My grandpa taught me
to always stand my ground.

82
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:35,139
What else did your grandfather
teach you?

83
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:38,042
He said never leave your fate
in someone else's hands.

84
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:43,048
Do you even know
what "fate" means, son?

85
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:47,251
And where the hell
were you two? Huh?

86
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:49,255
This isn't the time
to be making mistakes.

87
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:51,921
Get him back to the camp.

88
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:54,323
We're going on
to the lodge. Now.

89
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:56,060
What about Larsen
and the rest of them?

90
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:57,361
They didn't show.

91
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:59,129
I told you Larsen
couldn't be trusted.

92
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:00,930
He either
got 'em all killed

93
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:02,332
or he ran off
with that damn money.

94
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:04,070
You don't know shit.

95
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:08,138
Sorry, Father.

96
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,043
What do you want me
to do with it?

97
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:12,275
Just leave it.

98
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:14,844
It's supposed to be bad luck
not taking the kill with us.

99
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:17,214
Oh, really?

100
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,982
It's supposed
to be bad luck?

101
00:26:18,984 --> 00:26:20,086
You're bad luck.

102
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:54,150
Go ahead.

103
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:56,453
You show up alone
and they'll kill him.

104
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:58,391
And then you.

105
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,124
Who will?

106
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:02,127
Who has my son?

107
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:10,869
Father.

108
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:13,139
Who's Father?

109
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,244
How long have we
been down here?

110
00:29:07,186 --> 00:29:08,353
A couple hours.

111
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:12,491
Is this necessary?

112
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,263
What's your name?

113
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:20,266
Larsen.

114
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:25,101
Well, Larsen,

115
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:26,206
something just doesn't add up.

116
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:29,575
Why didn't you
kill me back there?

117
00:29:34,246 --> 00:29:35,678
I didn't come here
for no killing.

118
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,281
Well, your friend
sure as hell did.

119
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:38,248
Lady, I didn't know.

120
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,519
I don't give a shit
what you didn't know.

121
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,160
Look at him.

122
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:49,429
Look at him!

123
00:29:51,196 --> 00:29:53,266
You took him from me.

124
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:56,269
Now you're going to help me
get him back.

125
00:29:57,469 --> 00:29:59,171
And if I don't?

126
00:30:11,616 --> 00:30:13,518
Best start walking
while you still can.

127
00:31:41,806 --> 00:31:43,543
I need a...
I need a rest.

128
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:47,447
We need to keep moving.

129
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,316
Come on. I need...

130
00:31:53,451 --> 00:31:55,819
I need to catch my breath.

131
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:57,423
My leg is killing me.

132
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:09,167
A little higher,
you would have killed me.

133
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:11,571
Wasn't aiming to kill you.

134
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,505
Yeah. He said you were military.

135
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:17,841
Who? Charlie?

136
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:20,446
No. Father.

137
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:29,321
It's hard on a son
when his mother ain't around.

138
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:39,428
You know how much money

139
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,800
is in this bag
right here?

140
00:32:43,802 --> 00:32:45,601
I have a rough idea.

141
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:47,871
This is my family's legacy.

142
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:49,208
This is all we've got left.

143
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:51,643
I know.

144
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:55,214
How do you know?

145
00:32:56,481 --> 00:32:59,248
Because when your old man
shut down the mill,

146
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,684
that's all Father talked about.

147
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:02,655
It was money owed to him.

148
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,325
So when your old man died...

149
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,230
Get up.

150
00:33:12,898 --> 00:33:14,233
You've had enough rest.

151
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:54,406
What is it?

152
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:03,679
Blood.

153
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:04,851
Lots of it.

154
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,754
It's a wolf.

155
00:34:18,797 --> 00:34:19,832
It's been shot.

156
00:34:20,832 --> 00:34:22,435
A young one, too.

157
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,705
There's a lot
more of them.

158
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:34,844
Who is it?

159
00:34:34,846 --> 00:34:35,815
I don't know.

160
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,484
Can you see them?

161
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:41,917
Take off your boots.

162
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:43,587
What?

163
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:44,853
I said, give me your boots!

164
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,395
Come on, come on, come on.

165
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:53,699
I'd stay here if I were you.

166
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,022
- Come on.
- Hey!

167
00:35:53,024 --> 00:35:55,393
- Oh, shit.
- Stop!

168
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:00,932
Stop!

169
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,718
Larsen!

170
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:19,007
What were you thinking?

171
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:20,011
What were you thinking?

172
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,645
Father...

173
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:23,915
told me to wait.

174
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,768
He was just doing
what Father told him.

175
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:47,539
He didn't know no better.

176
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:57,750
Did you know we were
walking into an ambush?

177
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,922
You said my son
would be here.

178
00:38:05,723 --> 00:38:07,757
We were supposed to meet them
at the camp.

179
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:08,894
They probably left.

180
00:38:09,593 --> 00:38:10,926
Where's the camp?

181
00:38:10,928 --> 00:38:12,895
Through them trees.

182
00:38:12,897 --> 00:38:17,100
I have no use for you
if you can't get me to my son.

183
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:18,904
Where'd they take him?

184
00:38:21,105 --> 00:38:22,073
The lodge.

185
00:38:23,841 --> 00:38:25,208
What lodge?

186
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,643
It's an abandoned ski lodge.

187
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:28,111
It's on the back side
of the mountain.

188
00:38:28,113 --> 00:38:29,815
It's about a 10-hour hike
from here.

189
00:38:40,826 --> 00:38:42,561
I'm not leaving him
here like this.

190
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:45,564
He was like a brother to me.

191
00:38:47,598 --> 00:38:49,098
I won't run.

192
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,837
I'll get you to the lodge.
Just let me do right by him.

193
00:39:02,747 --> 00:39:03,716
Don't make me regret this.

194
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:58,837
Shit.

195
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:59,097
Do you ever get used
to taking a man's life?

196
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:05,237
I knew what
I signed up for.

197
00:41:09,274 --> 00:41:11,009
We've wasted enough time.

198
00:41:51,982 --> 00:41:53,952
You made
a good-looking fire, boy.

199
00:41:55,986 --> 00:41:57,755
You hungry?

200
00:42:15,073 --> 00:42:16,075
If you could untie me.

201
00:42:24,348 --> 00:42:26,051
You're not ready for that.

202
00:42:33,424 --> 00:42:34,792
Give me that.

203
00:43:28,145 --> 00:43:30,114
[wolves howling[

204
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,259
I can't feel my feet.

205
00:43:46,196 --> 00:43:48,998
How far to where
they're keeping him?

206
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,100
Over the ridge.

207
00:43:51,102 --> 00:43:52,404
About four, maybe five hours.

208
00:43:54,906 --> 00:43:56,408
Look, it's too dark.
We can't see worth shit.

209
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,275
What will they
do to him

210
00:44:00,277 --> 00:44:01,446
up at the lodge?

211
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:10,018
They'll get him ready
for a hand-off...

212
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,122
to a buyer.

213
00:44:12,457 --> 00:44:13,922
And after that?

214
00:44:13,924 --> 00:44:15,091
Lost to the world...

215
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:17,092
I imagine.

216
00:44:17,094 --> 00:44:19,330
You were never going to give him
back to me, were you?

217
00:44:20,297 --> 00:44:22,531
What's the matter
with you people?

218
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:24,035
What if that was your child?

219
00:44:32,243 --> 00:44:33,911
I was that child.

220
00:45:09,013 --> 00:45:10,949
What is it?

221
00:45:15,386 --> 00:45:17,189
It weren't nothing.

222
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:22,493
You look a little scared.

223
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:28,563
You saw what they did
to Phillip.

224
00:45:28,565 --> 00:45:30,268
And I know you're out of ammo.

225
00:45:32,502 --> 00:45:35,140
Truth be told, it's not
the wolves I'm worried about.

226
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,412
I'm making a fire.

227
00:45:50,154 --> 00:45:52,455
There's something
I don't understand.

228
00:45:52,457 --> 00:45:54,526
Why didn't you
just let me drown?

229
00:45:58,263 --> 00:45:59,031
I don't know.

230
00:46:01,632 --> 00:46:03,401
I guess
there's better ways to die.

231
00:46:09,306 --> 00:46:11,209
You don't have to die
on this mountain.

232
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,113
You think about that.

233
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:27,192
You said you were that child.

234
00:46:29,426 --> 00:46:31,028
So?

235
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:39,669
When I was about your son's age,

236
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,174
my parents owed Father money.

237
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:47,044
When they couldn't pay,
he came to collect.

238
00:46:49,647 --> 00:46:53,516
He killed my daddy.

239
00:46:53,518 --> 00:46:56,384
He took my mom and me
as payment,

240
00:46:56,386 --> 00:46:59,156
and he kept her for himself.

241
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:06,097
She had the chance to escape.
She ran.

242
00:47:08,332 --> 00:47:09,464
For the longest time,

243
00:47:09,466 --> 00:47:13,703
I waited for her
to come back to get me.

244
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,239
She never did.

245
00:47:19,176 --> 00:47:20,344
Why didn't you run?

246
00:47:24,214 --> 00:47:25,283
And go where?

247
00:47:33,223 --> 00:47:35,227
I think we have a lot more
in common than you think.

248
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:38,663
From what the letter said...

249
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,601
...he didn't take Charlie
for the money.

250
00:47:45,703 --> 00:47:49,107
He's looking at getting revenge
on a man who's already dead.

251
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,228
Get up.

252
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,565
Get up.

253
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:51,333
Seth.

254
00:48:51,335 --> 00:48:53,171
Cut his ties.

255
00:48:58,308 --> 00:48:59,310
They're out there.

256
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:03,080
- How many?
- Too many.

257
00:49:10,388 --> 00:49:12,455
You ready?

258
00:49:12,457 --> 00:49:13,491
I sure hope so.

259
00:49:18,328 --> 00:49:20,196
Remember
what your grandfather said.

260
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:21,266
Always stand
my ground.

261
00:49:52,296 --> 00:49:53,629
There.

262
00:50:11,716 --> 00:50:13,418
Shit.

263
00:50:24,728 --> 00:50:26,395
Damn!

264
00:50:50,353 --> 00:50:51,288
Don't move, Charlie.

265
00:50:52,589 --> 00:50:53,589
Don't run!

266
00:50:53,591 --> 00:50:55,460
Charlie! Don't!

267
00:50:56,794 --> 00:50:58,163
Charlie!

268
00:50:59,763 --> 00:51:00,698
Damn it!

269
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:00,225
Grab it.

270
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,859
Oh, you stupid kid.

271
00:52:03,861 --> 00:52:04,796
You shit.

272
00:52:07,265 --> 00:52:08,232
Come on.

273
00:53:02,752 --> 00:53:04,455
Keep moving.

274
00:53:07,924 --> 00:53:09,526
The boy
can hardly stand.

275
00:53:11,462 --> 00:53:12,564
Son of a bitch.

276
00:53:16,801 --> 00:53:17,835
Leave him be.

277
00:53:22,707 --> 00:53:23,739
You can throw
the rest away

278
00:53:23,741 --> 00:53:24,809
for all I care.

279
00:53:33,783 --> 00:53:35,586
You're a proud one,
ain't you, little boy?

280
00:53:36,853 --> 00:53:40,355
You're just like your
grandfather used to be.

281
00:53:40,357 --> 00:53:42,424
You knew my grandpa?

282
00:53:42,426 --> 00:53:43,458
Oh, yeah.

283
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,625
I knew your
grandfather.

284
00:53:44,627 --> 00:53:46,730
He was a righteous man.

285
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:50,632
But a long time ago,

286
00:53:50,634 --> 00:53:55,737
the Lord turned his face away
from your grandfather,

287
00:53:55,739 --> 00:53:58,410
and he came to me on his knees.

288
00:54:00,678 --> 00:54:02,478
What did you do?

289
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,948
I did what any
decent man would do.

290
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,886
To a man who was drowning,
I gave him my hand.

291
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:12,754
What happened?

292
00:54:12,756 --> 00:54:14,922
He took it...

293
00:54:14,924 --> 00:54:18,462
and then he tried
to pull me down with him.

294
00:54:19,964 --> 00:54:21,730
He kicked me.

295
00:54:21,732 --> 00:54:25,734
He stood on my back,

296
00:54:25,736 --> 00:54:28,672
and he tried to get me down
all the way to the bottom.

297
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,476
He was a righteous man.

298
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:37,549
He was a self-righteous man.

299
00:54:38,915 --> 00:54:40,951
There's no forgiveness
in that man.

300
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:46,558
He did to me
what your mother's doing to you.

301
00:54:51,562 --> 00:54:52,797
You don't get it, do you?

302
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:58,466
If she paid the ransom...

303
00:54:58,468 --> 00:54:59,803
they'd be here by now.

304
00:55:08,044 --> 00:55:09,413
Come on, boy.

305
00:55:17,687 --> 00:55:18,953
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.

306
00:55:18,955 --> 00:55:20,656
Huh? Where are the boys?

307
00:55:20,658 --> 00:55:21,924
I told him
no one's coming back.

308
00:55:21,926 --> 00:55:23,625
What the hell are you saying?

309
00:55:23,627 --> 00:55:25,460
This Larsen can't be trusted.

310
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,995
I would have been back by now,
I guarantee that.

311
00:55:27,997 --> 00:55:28,966
That's enough!

312
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,600
You talk like that
about him again,

313
00:55:31,602 --> 00:55:32,634
I'll fucking kill you.

314
00:55:32,636 --> 00:55:33,605
Hey!

315
00:55:35,004 --> 00:55:38,739
Boy, I hate to raise my voice.

316
00:55:38,741 --> 00:55:42,511
Now, one way or the other,

317
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:45,781
those boys,
they haven't come back.

318
00:55:45,783 --> 00:55:48,083
So if they're not dead...

319
00:55:48,085 --> 00:55:49,954
they'd better
goddamn wish they were!

320
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:53,589
Wait.

321
00:55:53,591 --> 00:55:55,491
We're not waiting on them?

322
00:55:55,493 --> 00:55:56,628
We're not waiting
on them.

323
00:55:57,694 --> 00:56:00,596
The plan remains the same.

324
00:56:00,598 --> 00:56:02,864
Turn the kid over
tomorrow night.

325
00:56:02,866 --> 00:56:04,002
Seth, throw him in the room.

326
00:56:07,504 --> 00:56:08,839
Get over here,
you little shit.

327
00:56:09,973 --> 00:56:11,475
Okay.

328
00:56:21,852 --> 00:56:22,786
Hold on!

329
00:56:29,026 --> 00:56:30,893
Let me tell you something
about your grandfather

330
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:32,728
that he didn't know!

331
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:37,900
Your fate is always
in somebody else's hands!

332
00:56:37,902 --> 00:56:39,838
And it's your family's fate
to suffer!

333
00:56:41,538 --> 00:56:43,605
Your grandfather
didn't know that!

334
00:56:43,607 --> 00:56:44,672
He didn't believe it,

335
00:56:44,674 --> 00:56:47,911
so he took fate in his own hands
and he crossed me!

336
00:56:49,113 --> 00:56:52,917
Now fate's just
biding her time...

337
00:56:56,654 --> 00:56:59,788
waiting for you
to come back here

338
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:01,692
and she can take what is hers.

339
00:57:29,986 --> 00:57:31,088
Where's Charlie's father?

340
00:57:35,658 --> 00:57:37,094
Somewhere in the desert.

341
00:57:39,062 --> 00:57:40,895
We met in Afghanistan.

342
00:57:40,897 --> 00:57:43,033
I got pregnant, so we came home.

343
00:57:46,203 --> 00:57:49,870
Right after Charlie was born,

344
00:57:49,872 --> 00:57:53,641
an IED took out
his father's Humvee.

345
00:57:53,643 --> 00:57:54,879
There was nothing left.

346
00:57:56,814 --> 00:58:00,214
A couple of years later,
I re-deployed.

347
00:58:00,216 --> 00:58:01,885
I told myself
I needed to be there.

348
00:58:03,886 --> 00:58:07,955
The truth is...

349
00:58:07,957 --> 00:58:11,759
I cannot look in my son's face

350
00:58:11,761 --> 00:58:14,131
without seeing his father
staring back at me.

351
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:20,234
I'm sorry.

352
00:58:20,236 --> 00:58:21,872
Not as sorry as I am.

353
00:58:23,073 --> 00:58:24,908
I should have never left my son.

354
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:35,719
Is that where
they're keeping him?

355
00:58:52,268 --> 00:58:53,805
Let's go.

356
00:59:05,082 --> 00:59:06,248
Is that everything?

357
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,785
Yeah.

358
00:59:14,857 --> 00:59:15,792
I just checked that.

359
00:59:17,093 --> 00:59:18,729
Yeah, well...

360
00:59:29,138 --> 00:59:30,674
Hey.

361
00:59:31,709 --> 00:59:32,810
Over there.

362
00:59:39,716 --> 00:59:41,218
It's Larsen.

363
00:59:45,855 --> 00:59:47,691
Well, I'll be
a son of a bitch.

364
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:51,695
It's Larsen.

365
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:53,962
- Get Father.
- Yeah.

366
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:55,096
Keep the kid inside.

367
00:59:55,098 --> 00:59:55,964
Father!

368
00:59:55,966 --> 00:59:57,234
Looks like Larsen
brought us a gift!

369
01:00:20,256 --> 01:00:22,125
Where's Father?

370
01:00:26,263 --> 01:00:28,362
You come here to kill us all?

371
01:00:28,364 --> 01:00:30,866
I'm only here for my son.

372
01:00:30,868 --> 01:00:32,868
You think that
by bringing that stray dog

373
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,203
back to me,

374
01:00:35,205 --> 01:00:38,140
that's going to make me
hand over your son?

375
01:00:38,142 --> 01:00:40,308
I'm taking my son

376
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:42,877
and leaving the money
that was agreed on.

377
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,914
Show him!

378
01:00:58,995 --> 01:01:01,263
Where's the rest of my boys?

379
01:01:01,265 --> 01:01:03,167
Dead.

380
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,074
Is it true?

381
01:01:14,178 --> 01:01:15,976
Did she kill all your brothers?

382
01:01:15,978 --> 01:01:19,049
You brought this to my doorstep
when you took Charlie.

383
01:01:20,283 --> 01:01:22,216
You think
you're going to deal with me

384
01:01:22,218 --> 01:01:24,319
after you killed my boys?

385
01:01:24,321 --> 01:01:26,888
I'll kill more
if you force me to.

386
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,326
You pull that trigger,
you're dead.

387
01:01:30,093 --> 01:01:31,995
Let me do it, Father.

388
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:34,931
Father!

389
01:01:36,098 --> 01:01:37,033
We've lost enough.

390
01:01:39,303 --> 01:01:40,238
End this now.

391
01:01:42,172 --> 01:01:43,107
Please.

392
01:01:53,149 --> 01:01:54,352
A son for a son.

393
01:01:56,018 --> 01:01:57,354
Put your weapons down!

394
01:02:04,227 --> 01:02:05,195
Put them down.

395
01:02:10,399 --> 01:02:11,968
Now put your hands on your head.

396
01:02:14,238 --> 01:02:15,306
Do it!

397
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:23,046
Charlie!

398
01:02:24,413 --> 01:02:26,049
Come out here, boy!

399
01:02:27,984 --> 01:02:29,053
Mom!

400
01:02:32,256 --> 01:02:33,257
Charlie!

401
01:02:35,225 --> 01:02:38,094
Get the weapons
and get over here.

402
01:02:40,497 --> 01:02:41,998
Charlie, get the weapons.

403
01:02:47,103 --> 01:02:48,172
Come on.

404
01:02:51,174 --> 01:02:52,276
Let's go,
Charlie.

405
01:02:58,982 --> 01:02:59,951
That's right.

406
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:02,018
Come on.

407
01:03:08,558 --> 01:03:09,493
Get behind me.

408
01:03:13,497 --> 01:03:14,464
Let's go.

409
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,070
Anybody follows,
and you're dead.

410
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:24,973
Father.

411
01:03:24,975 --> 01:03:25,977
Behind me.

412
01:03:31,247 --> 01:03:32,249
Start it up.

413
01:03:34,283 --> 01:03:35,417
You got what you came for.

414
01:03:35,419 --> 01:03:37,087
Go while
you still can.

415
01:03:39,156 --> 01:03:40,491
Clair Hamilton!

416
01:03:42,158 --> 01:03:44,391
Your father may have had
a restful death,

417
01:03:44,393 --> 01:03:48,096
but fate was not...

418
01:03:48,098 --> 01:03:50,101
finished with him...

419
01:03:53,035 --> 01:03:54,238
...or with you...

420
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,241
...or your kid.

421
01:04:01,078 --> 01:04:02,509
I said it.

422
01:04:02,511 --> 01:04:04,379
I said it.

423
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:06,513
A son for a son.

424
01:04:06,515 --> 01:04:08,449
But you're going to have
to carry him off this mountain!

425
01:04:08,451 --> 01:04:09,520
No!

426
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:47,591
Holy shit.

427
01:04:50,227 --> 01:04:51,062
Father!

428
01:04:55,131 --> 01:04:56,364
- Go get them.
- Give me the gun.

429
01:04:56,366 --> 01:04:57,435
Go get them.

430
01:05:16,453 --> 01:05:18,386
Hey.

431
01:05:18,388 --> 01:05:19,556
Hey, are you okay?

432
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:06,403
Mom! Look out!

433
01:06:36,533 --> 01:06:38,569
Let's go, Charlie.
Come on.

434
01:06:40,603 --> 01:06:42,138
Come on.

435
01:07:13,335 --> 01:07:14,736
I need you
to keep running. Okay?

436
01:07:14,738 --> 01:07:19,274
Whatever you do,
don't stop.

437
01:07:19,276 --> 01:07:20,475
What about you?

438
01:07:20,477 --> 01:07:22,310
I'll be
right behind you.

439
01:07:22,312 --> 01:07:23,777
Okay?

440
01:07:23,779 --> 01:07:26,580
Okay? Run. Okay?

441
01:07:26,582 --> 01:07:27,651
You came back for me.

442
01:07:28,785 --> 01:07:30,250
Of course I did.

443
01:07:30,252 --> 01:07:31,221
Now go!

444
01:07:32,221 --> 01:07:33,223
Run!

445
01:08:28,778 --> 01:08:30,381
Charlie! No!

446
01:08:39,788 --> 01:08:43,259
Mom!

447
01:09:27,836 --> 01:09:29,439
Move!

448
01:09:32,341 --> 01:09:33,676
Come on.

449
01:09:34,943 --> 01:09:36,610
You want to end up
like your mother?

450
01:09:36,612 --> 01:09:37,714
Keep going.

451
01:09:40,483 --> 01:09:42,482
Get up! Get up!

452
01:09:43,553 --> 01:09:44,787
Go!

453
01:12:06,795 --> 01:12:08,498
All right, you little shit.

454
01:12:10,132 --> 01:12:13,500
You wanna play?
Huh, kid?

455
01:12:13,502 --> 01:12:14,670
I'll play.

456
01:12:16,672 --> 01:12:18,608
I live for this shit.

457
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:23,643
Where are you?

458
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:42,800
Got you, you little prick.

459
01:12:46,769 --> 01:12:47,771
Get over here!

460
01:13:47,029 --> 01:13:47,965
Don't.

461
01:14:05,715 --> 01:14:07,918
Go and tend to the generator.

462
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:12,589
Now!

463
01:14:49,759 --> 01:14:53,660
You know,
I can't remember a time

464
01:14:53,662 --> 01:14:57,765
when I wasn't driven by rage,

465
01:14:57,767 --> 01:15:02,104
and my father saw it in me
when I was a little boy.

466
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:06,173
He tried to beat it out of me.

467
01:15:06,175 --> 01:15:09,075
Imagine his surprise,

468
01:15:09,077 --> 01:15:11,878
how it all
came to a head for him

469
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,182
when I came of age.

470
01:15:21,724 --> 01:15:25,662
You know, I kept Hobbs first
out of curiosity.

471
01:15:28,831 --> 01:15:31,932
I thought I saw in her
a little bit of me,

472
01:15:31,934 --> 01:15:34,935
and I was right.

473
01:15:34,937 --> 01:15:37,974
If I didn't kill her father,
she would have.

474
01:15:39,776 --> 01:15:42,075
But I only kept the others...

475
01:15:42,077 --> 01:15:44,046
for weeding, housekeeping.

476
01:15:45,814 --> 01:15:50,086
You were the first one
I ever met I felt no rage for.

477
01:15:53,156 --> 01:15:55,158
You were the son I never had.

478
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:03,700
But you can't change
a man's true nature.

479
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:17,878
The day your mother ran off,

480
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,917
I should have known
I couldn't trust you.

481
01:16:22,117 --> 01:16:23,719
But today, you proved it.

482
01:16:24,854 --> 01:16:25,985
You got her...

483
01:16:25,987 --> 01:16:29,255
her betrayal...

484
01:16:29,257 --> 01:16:31,357
in your nature.

485
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,160
She betrayed her husband.

486
01:16:34,162 --> 01:16:36,297
She...
she tried to betray me,

487
01:16:36,299 --> 01:16:38,268
and she certainly
betrayed you...

488
01:16:39,402 --> 01:16:42,770
...when she ran off
and left you here alone.

489
01:16:42,772 --> 01:16:44,204
Huh?

490
01:16:44,206 --> 01:16:46,140
I should have killed you...

491
01:16:46,142 --> 01:16:48,211
the day I killed your mother.

492
01:17:01,858 --> 01:17:03,994
Don't die!
Don't die!

493
01:17:23,145 --> 01:17:24,410
Don't die!

494
01:17:24,412 --> 01:17:26,112
Don't die!

495
01:17:26,114 --> 01:17:27,213
Don't die!

496
01:17:27,215 --> 01:17:28,184
Don't die.

497
01:17:30,419 --> 01:17:31,852
I need you. Come on.

498
01:17:31,854 --> 01:17:32,986
Come on.

499
01:17:32,988 --> 01:17:35,291
I need you.
I need you.

500
01:17:39,327 --> 01:17:41,063
I'm not going to die.

501
01:17:43,431 --> 01:17:45,432
I'm not going to die...

502
01:17:45,434 --> 01:17:46,937
until you die.

503
01:18:04,153 --> 01:18:07,891
I always knew
you were my only weakness.

504
01:18:10,926 --> 01:18:12,194
A man has to kill...

505
01:18:13,295 --> 01:18:14,396
...what makes
him weak.

506
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:18,367
Father!

507
01:18:21,269 --> 01:18:22,902
Where is...

508
01:18:22,904 --> 01:18:25,142
my son?

509
01:18:44,059 --> 01:18:46,028
Where is he?
Where is he?

510
01:18:55,904 --> 01:18:56,907
Mom!

511
01:19:11,287 --> 01:19:13,020
I was always your fate.

512
01:19:13,022 --> 01:19:14,021
Father...

513
01:19:14,023 --> 01:19:16,022
This is for my mother!

514
01:19:24,934 --> 01:19:26,002
No!

515
01:19:32,407 --> 01:19:34,176
Charlie.

516
01:19:38,113 --> 01:19:39,280
Are you okay?

517
01:19:39,282 --> 01:19:40,547
I'm okay.

518
01:19:40,549 --> 01:19:42,385
- Okay.
- I'm okay.

519
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,163
I got my boy back,
thanks to you.

520
01:19:55,197 --> 01:19:56,562
I'm...

521
01:19:56,564 --> 01:19:58,434
getting off this mountain.

522
01:20:00,435 --> 01:20:01,438
Yeah.

523
01:21:01,162 --> 01:21:03,030
Come on, Charlie.

524
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:04,034
Let's go.

525
01:22:52,741 --> 01:22:54,377
Guess you'll need
these back.

526
01:22:55,411 --> 01:22:58,114
Why don't you hang
onto them for me?

527
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:36,279

3
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:55,389
He moves through this town unseen,
like a ghost,

4
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:59,601
and he kills at will every year.

5
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,856
The Blissfield Butcher started
his reign of terror in 1977,

6
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,108
and it continues to this day.

7
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,901
A geriatric serial killer?

8
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,194
Really?

9
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,781
Don't underestimate a straight white man's
propensity for violence, Isaac.

10
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,658
I don't care how fucking old they are.

11
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,744
And your story... it's bullshit, Evan.

12
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,705
The Butcher killed some kids,
like, in the '90s,

13
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,123
and then 20 years ago, he disappeared.

14
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,583
The rest is just local folklore.

15
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,793
Yeah, but didn't the Butcher,
like, also kill

16
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,003
a bunch of kids at prom way back when?

17
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,796
Not prom. Homecoming.

18
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,883
All the Blissfield Butcher stories
are centered around homecoming.

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,927
And a new legend pops up every year

20
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,096
during homecoming week
to warn Blissfield's teenagers

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,557
of the dangers of "underage debauchery."

22
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,643
What will this year's story be?

23
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,523
Oh, my God, Isaac!

24
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,984
I smell like cheap beer now.

25
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,486
Hey, there's some soda water in the bar.
That usually helps.

26
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,799
What is all this shit?

27
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,260
Ginny's dad's an art collector.

28
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,763
That's pretty cool.

29
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,475
Hmm.

30
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,070
{\an8}Wow.

31
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:36,949
The fuck's La Dola?

32
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,493
Hey, there's no way to open this thing.

33
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,538
Are you gonna help me or not?

34
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,291
Uh, not with that attitude.

35
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,549
Mmm-hmm!

36
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,894
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

37
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,446
Mon...

38
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,157
Montra... Montrach...

39
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,783
Montrachet?

40
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,623
Oh, shit.

41
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,960
Yeah, nice one, Sandra.
You made me drop it.

42
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,588
God.

43
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,964
God, they're gonna kill me.

44
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,476
This looks so expensive.

45
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,061
Damn it.

46
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,780
You know, you could at least
come down and help me clean this up.

47
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,509
"Not with that attitude."

48
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,094
Whatever, Isaac.

49
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,766
One moment, please.

50
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,314
Aggro-knocking won't
make me move any faster.

51
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,980
Wait. What about me?

52
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,732
You're taking too long.

53
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,443
It's a vagina,
not an all-night drive-through.

54
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,070
Can we go three more minutes?
That's all I need.

55
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,864
You know, that's really inconsiderate.

56
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,991
Yeah, 'cause guys are
always so considerate.

57
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,075
Maybe a handy?

58
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,800
Help!

59
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,883
Daddy.

60
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,754
Did you see the car
at the end of the driveway?

61
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,256
- No.
- I did.

62
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,092
She better not have boys over.

63
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,927
Oh, if she does, I'm gonna fucking...

64
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,931
Oh, my God!

65
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,929
Millie, breakfast!

66
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,521
- Good morning.
- Morning.

67
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,398
It smells so good.

68
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,234
Banana pancakes, Kessler family recipe.

69
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,402
Mmm.

70
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,117
- I'll take mine to go.
- Hey. No, no, no.

71
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,452
Come sit down.

72
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,120
Let's eat like a family for a change.

73
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,164
Family. Right.

74
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,089
See? Isn't this nice?

75
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,009
It feels like we hardly ever
do this anymore

76
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,302
since your-your dad...

77
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,929
So, Millie,

78
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,972
do you have a date
for homecoming tomorrow?

79
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,767
I, um... I'm not... I'm not going.

80
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,143
She has a date with me.

81
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,729
We're going to see <i>Wicked</i>
at the Anus Theater.

82
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,272
"Ann-is."

83
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,858
Wow.

84
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:50,943
What?

85
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,027
Nothing.

86
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,949
It just seems a little weird to miss out
on a seminal high school experience

87
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,159
to go see shit regional theater
with your mom.

88
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,162
Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you
supposed to discourage her

89
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,413
from things like that?

90
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,583
You know it's just underage drinking

91
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,503
and God knows what else
that can end in tragedy.

92
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,215
Oh, her night is still ending in tragedy.

93
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,633
Charlene.

94
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,219
Yeah, I mean, you want to go.
You're excited, right, Millie?

95
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,680
Yeah. Of course.

96
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,063
I got to go. The sheriff says it's urgent.

97
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,498
Mmm.

98
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,209
Pancakes are really good, Mom.

99
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,962
Oh. Thanks, honey.

100
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,847
Keep up, ladies.

101
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,939
Morning, Millie.

102
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,317
Hi, Mr. Daniels.

103
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,027
Say hello.

104
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,113
Hello. You're so cute.

105
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,784
I love your black wiener, Mr. Daniels.

106
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,287
Joshua.

107
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,830
The dog is black, Nyla.

108
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,540
Let's go far.

109
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,042
Oh, my God.

110
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,588
- I-I couldn't.
- Millie, you promised.

111
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,007
I know, but she made me feel so bad.

112
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,218
Your mom's superpower is guilt.

113
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,303
Now you're gonna miss the homecoming dance

114
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,889
to go watch some hag in green face
hanging from a wire?

115
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,390
Come on. Tit up.

116
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,309
It's just a stupid dance.
Why do you want to go, anyway?

117
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,186
I have to shoot it for yearbook.

118
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,064
I'm in it for the drunk straight boys
who will suddenly realize they're fluid.

119
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,650
- That sounds kind of rapey.
- Good.

120
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,152
Have you seen what's
on the menu in this town?

121
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,656
- Is that the mailman?
- Oh, my God.

122
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,200
Welcome to Tragicstan.

123
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,160
- And hello.
- Oh, my...

124
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,329
Booker is gonna be at the dance.

125
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,414
This is your chance to land that plane.

126
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,251
I'm not landing that plane or any plane.

127
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,461
He hardly knows I exist.

128
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,214
Are you serious?
You're a fucking piece, girl.

129
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,049
- Oh, I'm a piece?
- Uh-huh.

130
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,135
Okay, barf choice of words
or not, Joshua's right.

131
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,221
You got it, Mill. You just need to own it.

132
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,265
See? Even Miss Word Police agrees.

133
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,975
You're going. That's final.

134
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,103
Hey, Mill, hold on a sec.

135
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,648
It's been a year.

136
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,193
You can't keep living your life
for someone else.

137
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,362
You've got to start doing things for you.

138
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,031
Yeah, it's just...

139
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,242
It's not that easy.

140
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,995
My dad was her whole world.

141
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,998
I get it. I really do.

142
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,583
You don't want to hurt
your mom's feelings.

143
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,835
It's why I love you.

144
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,922
I just... I don't want you
to wake up one morning

145
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:04,219
and realize your whole life passed you by
'cause you were busy being everything

146
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,013
to everyone but you.

147
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,310
I'll see you at lunch, okay?

148
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,188
- I love you.
- I love you.

149
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:38,128
Whoo!

150
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,176
Millie, hi.

151
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,262
Hi, Ryler.

152
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,015
I love your dress.

153
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,392
- Thanks.
- Where'd you get it?

154
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,895
I... don't know.

155
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,314
I, um... I've had it a long time.

156
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,108
I think I saw it at Discount Bonanza.

157
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,694
I had to pee.

158
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,404
Did your mom use her employee discount?

159
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,327
Anyway, you look adorbs, seriously.

160
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,125
God.

161
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,517
Oh, my...

162
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,021
And I did a common A-frame,

163
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,024
but with delicate detail
to the window framing.

164
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,112
Any dog would kill
to call this their home.

165
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,197
If you installed some speakers,

166
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:50,951
threw down a rug,
it'd be the ultimate pooch pad.

167
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,039
Sorry, Mr. Bernardi.

168
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,418
- Late again, Miss Kessler.
- It won't happen again.

169
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,962
I doubt that. Just sit down.

170
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,591
It's very nice.

171
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,510
This woodwork is exceptional.

172
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,220
- Thanks, Mr. B.
- Hey.

173
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:13,056
Pro tip: always set your watch
five minutes ahead.

174
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,349
It saves my ass, like, every time.

175
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:16,977
Thanks.

176
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,146
Château Fido.

177
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,898
Come on.

178
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,649
Great work, Phil.

179
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,943
Once again, setting the class standard.

180
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,072
Next up is...

181
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,034
Oh, Millie Kessler.

182
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,620
Time to present your doghouse.

183
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:39,458
Uh, my presentation
isn't scheduled till next week.

184
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,126
This isn't debate class.

185
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,630
But you said the 16th.

186
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,132
Um, it's not ready yet.

187
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,555
Once again, Miss Kessler
is holding up the class.

188
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,726
And once again,
Miss Kessler is unprepared.

189
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,270
Dick.

190
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,939
Something to add, Booker?

191
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:03,899
Nope.

192
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,029
Can I just... do it the 16th?

193
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,696
Can I just do it the 16th?

194
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:11,781
Speak up.

195
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:18,747
Oh, crocodile tear doesn't excuse
your poor planning, Miss Kessler.

196
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,345
My God.

197
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,766
This is completely bonkers.

198
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,102
I'm in shock.

199
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:44,398
I just saw Sandra two days ago in PE.

200
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,816
And now she's...

201
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,735
Oh, my God. It's a slaughterhouse.

202
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,946
Are you smiling?

203
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,906
Everybody is freaking out.

204
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,700
Check it out.

205
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,871
<i>Ginny was one of my best friends.</i>

206
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,080
<i>Why?</i>

207
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,748
Bitch, please.

208
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,417
Ginny hated Ryler

209
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,210
after she started that rumor
about Ginny getting a carrot

210
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,212
- stuck in her pussy.
- Don't say that word.

211
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,173
Whatever. Vagina.

212
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,091
Who would do something like this?

213
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,342
The Blissfield Butcher.

214
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,262
He's just an urban legend. He's not real.

215
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,805
Mmm, four very dead teens.

216
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,183
It seems pretty real to me.

217
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,642
They're gonna have to cancel homecoming.

218
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,394
Please.

219
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,605
Homecoming is like Christmas around here.

220
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,356
They're not canceling it.

221
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,990
Told ya.

222
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,533
Hail, hail, Blissfield High!

223
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,744
Chomp, chomp, chomp, our battle cry!

224
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,912
Yo, guys, check this, check this.

225
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:44,124
When our Beavers come to fight,
feel our glory and our might!

226
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,461
Only beaver nobody would touch!

227
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:52,299
I mean, if you brown-bag her face,
she's sort of doable.

228
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,809
I smell like orange soda.

229
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,686
It's not that bad.

230
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,564
You should quit. It is not worth it.

231
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,108
Extracurriculars look good
on applications.

232
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,861
As if your mom would ever
let you go away to college.

233
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,905
Hey.

234
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,617
She's late. Again.

235
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,286
- You sure you don't want a ride?
- Yeah.

236
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,789
Yeah, she'll be here. She
probably just stopped for gas.

237
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,749
- You want us to wait with you?
- Mmm-mmm.

238
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,877
There is a psycho roaming free.

239
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,587
No.

240
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,006
I'm good. There's plenty of people around.

241
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,508
And she'll be here any minute.

242
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,344
I'm good. Just go.

243
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,056
Okay.

244
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:46,979
Bye, Mill.

245
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:49,189
- Bye. Love you.
- Bye-bye. Love you, poodle.

246
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,358
Thank you very much.

247
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,277
- Love you.
- Love you.

248
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,406
- Bye.
- Bye!

249
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:25,767
<i>And it's yours, right now, for only 46...</i>

250
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,783
Goddamn it.

251
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:47,998
Shit.

252
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,711
Hi.

253
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,923
<i>She's passed out on the couch again.</i>

254
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,424
Can you come get...

255
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,301
You've got to be kidding me right now.

256
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,407
<i>She'll be</i>

257
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:26,119
<i>Comin' round the mountain when she comes</i>

258
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:30,791
<i>She'll be comin' round
The mountain when she comes</i>

259
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,085
<i>She'll be comin' round the mountain</i>

260
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,712
<i>She'll be comin' round the mountain</i>

261
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,800
<i>He'll be comin'...</i>

262
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,223
Please don't be the Butcher.

263
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,724
Please don't be the Butcher.
Please don't be the Butcher.

264
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,275
My sister's gonna be here any second!

265
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:57,568
She's a cop!

266
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,240
With a gun!

267
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,379
Shit.

268
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:22,843
Help! Help me!

269
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:25,179
Help!

270
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,347
No!

271
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:29,892
No!

272
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,019
No!

273
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,740
No! No!

274
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,452
No!

275
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:15,289
No! No! No! No!

276
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:18,834
No!

277
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,011
No!

278
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:44,234
Get away from her!

279
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,616
Millie! Millie!

280
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,326
Oh, my God!

281
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,078
6542 to dispatch.

282
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,706
I need an ambulance at my location ASAP!

283
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,292
Hey.

284
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,127
You're okay. You're okay.

285
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:05,047
- It hurt him, too.
- You're in shock. It's okay.

286
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,840
- Help's coming, okay?
- It hurt him, too.

287
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,300
It's okay. It's okay. Help's coming.

288
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:09,468
Help's on the way.

289
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,678
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

290
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,816
<i>You want us to wait with you?</i>

291
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,236
<i>There is a psycho roaming free.</i>

292
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,029
<i>There's plenty of people around.</i>

293
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,447
<i>She'll be here any minute.</i>

294
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:44,795
<i>Millie! Millie!</i>

295
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,713
<i>Oh, my God! What happened?</i>

296
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,590
<i>What happened to you?</i>

297
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:51,343
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

298
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:15,117
No, it wasn't my fault!

299
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,703
I know. But I was just coming home.

300
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:20,205
I was gonna sleep until 4:30.

301
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,249
I was so tired. I had one glass of wine.

302
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,959
You did not have one glass of wine!

303
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,836
No, you had an entire bottle
of wine to drink.

304
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,380
- It was one glass of wine!
- Yeah, right.

305
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,485
<i>Sleep till morning.</i>

306
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:52,571
<i>Rest. Sleep.</i>

307
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,159
<i>La Dola.</i>

308
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,376
Hey.

309
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,086
Good. You're up.

310
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,129
How are you feeling?

311
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:55,467
Okay, then.

312
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:58,971
How's your shoulder?

313
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,313
You know what?

314
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:10,148
Let's go get manicures after work, huh?

315
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,362
Okay, then.
Well, I'm gonna give you a minute.

316
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:19,825
And, uh, I made French toast,
with your favorite:

317
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,411
caramelized bananas.

318
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:26,874
Okay.

319
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:05,078
Mill, come on.

320
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:07,080
Food's getting cold.

321
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,688
Where am I?

322
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:34,650
Hello?

323
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:39,279
Oh, my God. Why do I sound like that?

324
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,392
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus.

325
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:15,190
Okay. You are just hallucinating.

326
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,609
- Hey! You got any jelly beans?
- I'm sorry.

327
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,486
- Do I have jelly beans?
- You know, ice cubes.

328
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,655
Uh, crunch and munch.
You got some drugs, man?

329
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,365
Oh, my God. No, I don't have any drugs.

330
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:24,575
I'm not a drug person.

331
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:25,826
Uh, may I ask you a question?

332
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:27,619
- What?
- Yeah. Just, you know,

333
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:29,329
I'm just curious. What do I look like?

334
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:31,832
Like, when you're seeing me right now?

335
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:35,002
Do I look like a, um, you know,
do I look like a girl?

336
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,296
- Girl?
- Yeah.

337
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:40,841
You know, like, five-foot-five.
Very petite blond.

338
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,760
You're fucking lying, man.

339
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:46,430
You, you, you got drugs.
You're high right now.

340
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:47,681
Oh, no, no. I don't have the drugs.

341
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:48,807
Come on, man. Give me some of those.

342
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:49,975
- That's good stuff.
- Please don't. Please don't.

343
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,560
I want to feel like a teenage girl.
I want to feel like a girl.

344
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,061
I said... Help me!

345
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:55,314
Come on! Come back! Come back!

346
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:56,940
I'll suck your dick!

347
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,234
All of it!

348
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,532
{\an8}<i>I'm here just outside
Blissfield Valley High School,</i>

349
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:08,243
<i>where a teenage girl
was viciously attacked.</i>

350
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:10,621
<i>The survivor,
whose name is being withheld...</i>

351
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:12,247
Oh, hey, sweetie.

352
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:14,374
I didn't see you there.

353
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,835
You're like a little ninja.

354
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,420
Come on.

355
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:20,631
Come on, I made you breakfast.

356
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,050
Sit, silly.

357
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,384
Come on.

358
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,095
Here you go.

359
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:30,390
I really want you to try to eat, okay?

360
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:38,524
Got you some fresh pineapple.

361
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,400
I know how much you love it.

362
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,444
It's a good juicy one, too.

363
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:50,035
Oh.

364
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,248
Mama forgot the syrup.

365
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:57,793
There you go.

366
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:59,419
Try to eat something, okay?

367
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,339
Mmm.

368
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,093
Crispy, like you like it.

369
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:07,427
Mmm.

370
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:09,596
Mmm.

371
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,224
Oh. Oh, my word.

372
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,643
Yeah, okay. All right.
I guess you are hungry.

373
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,813
Who on earth is...

374
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:24,111
Hey, Mrs. K.

375
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,362
Hi, Frank.

376
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:29,867
I was gonna stick this in your box,
but I figured I better check on y'all.

377
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,660
Oh, okay. Well, thank you.

378
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,579
How... how's Millie?

379
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,956
I heard. It's just awful.

380
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:37,958
Well...

381
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,587
I think she's a little bit in shock,
but she's gonna be okay.

382
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:48,385
Mom, this house
smells like a fucking Denny's.

383
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:50,888
Hey.

384
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,015
I thought you were still sleeping.

385
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,021
Good morning?

386
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,774
Okay.

387
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,829
I got it, sweetie.

388
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,666
- Bye.
- Have a good day, honey.

389
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,959
- Be safe.
- Thanks, Mom.

390
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,211
Okay.

391
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:25,839
Honey, I think you should go
and get some more rest.

392
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,260
You're not thinking
of going to school, are you?

393
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:32,471
School?

394
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:35,516
I mean, I know your friends must be
worried about you, but...

395
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:39,353
Friends.

396
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,442
<i>The suspect,
now identified as</i>

397
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:48,195
{\an8}<i>Quentin Shermer, escaped
the Avondale Sanatorium,</i>

398
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:51,740
{\an8}<i>a maximum-security facility
for the criminally insane.</i>

399
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:54,952
<i>Shermer, also known by locals
as the Blissfield Butcher,</i>

400
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:57,371
<i>murdered his mother and infamously left</i>

401
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:00,666
<i>her severed head
outside a Dairy Queen in 1992.</i>

402
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:29,570
Mr. Daniels?

403
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:31,697
Mr. Daniels, it's...

404
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,447
Who are you?

405
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:35,117
- It's okay. Oh!
- Oh!

406
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,451
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

407
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,661
Are you okay?

408
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:38,829
It's you.

409
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,414
- No.
- It's him!

410
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,831
It's him!

411
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:34,194
Is that...

412
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:37,531
Does she look cute?

413
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:47,958
What's with the outfit, Mill?

414
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:51,253
Uh, I can't believe your mom
let you come to school today.

415
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:53,839
Are you okay?

416
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:56,049
- Ow.
- Smile for Insta.

417
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:01,388
Millie, you're Blissfield's victim.
We love you.

418
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,473
- Can you not, Ryler?
- Piss off, Ryler.

419
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:05,058
This is not about you.

420
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:08,020
Fuck off.

421
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:13,317
And that police sketch...
of course that guy's a killer.

422
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,736
That gross, bloated,
sweaty face and brown teeth.

423
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,614
I mean, I don't think I've ever
seen anyone as hideous as that.

424
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:20,657
- Take me.
- Uh, where?

425
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:24,453
Someplace...

426
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:26,371
private.

427
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:28,207
Oh, my God.

428
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,833
Something else happened
last night, didn't it?

429
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,044
You can totally tell me.
I'm, like, the most trustworthy person.

430
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:44,264
Smells like hot dog water.

431
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,561
Fudge!

432
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:54,066
I'm a giant. I'm a giant.

433
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,622
Okay. Tell me everything.

434
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,254
Did he...

435
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,339
You know.

436
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,927
I've seen "SVU." I know the signs.

437
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,432
Uh, hello.

438
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,241
Oh.

439
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:47,119
Wait, are you...

440
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:51,039
I mean, it's fine if you are.

441
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:58,589
What? Honestly, Millie,
I'm missing AP bio.

442
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,465
I didn't come here to clam-jam with you.

443
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,014
I've had, like, ten kombuchas today,

444
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:09,391
so I'm gonna go pee, and when I get back,

445
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:12,144
you're either spilling the tea or I'm out.

446
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:14,980
Freak.

447
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:27,743
Hello?

448
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:40,088
Hello?

449
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:55,062
Millie?

450
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:21,255
Oh. Oh, my God.

451
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:22,673
Millie, The Butcher's here.

452
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:25,467
- He's here. We need to go.
- You need to hide.

453
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:32,599
Wha...

454
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:34,768
- Are you sure this is safe?
- No.

455
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:37,229
No!

456
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:40,774
What was that?

457
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:43,777
Millie! Millie! Millie!

458
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:45,445
Millie, come back!

459
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:48,448
Millie! Millie!

460
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:50,075
Millie!

461
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:55,873
Much better.

462
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:24,193
Ryler.

463
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:38,373
<i>Due to the continued attacks
on our students,</i>

464
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:40,709
<i>together with the school board
and Sheriff Larkin,</i>

465
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:43,003
<i>I have decided to indefinitely postpone</i>

466
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,713
<i>tonight's homecoming dance.</i>

467
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:46,465
- What?
- <i>City-wide curfew</i>

468
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:48,509
<i>is in effect, starting at 8:00 p.m.</i>

469
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:52,054
<i>As police continue the manhunt
for the Blissfield Butcher...</i>

470
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:53,931
Miss Kessler.

471
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,933
I'm speaking to you, Miss Kessler.

472
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,518
<i>Stay safe, Beavers.</i>

473
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:06,902
Hey.

474
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:10,948
Hey, how are you holding up?

475
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:13,617
Aah!

476
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:26,463
Hot.

477
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,882
Goddamn it, Millie.

478
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:33,345
I am so sick of your constant
need for attention.

479
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:35,556
If only you would spend
a little less time flirting

480
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:36,723
and a little more time learning,

481
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:39,351
you might actually
make something out of yourself.

482
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:49,987
- Still nothing?
- I don't think she's coming.

483
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,113
She's acting weird.

484
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:53,782
She was almost killed last night, Ny.

485
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:56,451
Maybe we let her be weird for a day.

486
00:42:56,535 --> 00:42:57,744
I'm just worried about her.

487
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,872
Nyla, don't freak out.

488
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:02,749
Guys.

489
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:06,795
Guys!

490
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:12,092
Guys, guys, listen.
It's not what you think.

491
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:14,928
Come on!

492
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:18,765
Balls. I got balls.

493
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:23,478
- He's still following us!
- Guys!

494
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:26,190
You're Black! I'm gay! We are so dead!

495
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:28,901
Somebody help us, please!

496
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:30,444
Nyla! Josh!

497
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:32,446
Stop running. I'm not gonna hurt you.

498
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,655
It's me. It's Millie.

499
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:37,075
- What kind of sick fuck are you?
- How does he know our names?

500
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:39,244
- Stop running, please.
- You stay the fuck away from us!

501
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:41,705
Nyla, will you listen to me for a second?

502
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,041
Fuck!

503
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,045
Oh, God, I'm strong.

504
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:52,090
- Come on!
- Nyla, I'm so sorry. Let's just talk.

505
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:54,176
Guys. No, don't, don't!

506
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,803
Really?

507
00:43:57,554 --> 00:44:00,432
Josh! Guys, stop! Will you stop, Josh?

508
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:03,477
What, are you nuts?

509
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,688
- Ow! Will you stop throwing things at me?
- Josh, get him!

510
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,649
You got to stop!

511
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,443
Josh!

512
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:15,364
Guys! Okay, listen to me. Ow!

513
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:18,867
Stop it! Stop it.

514
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,369
Stop it.

515
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:24,164
Okay. Back up. Back up.

516
00:44:24,248 --> 00:44:25,457
Guys, listen to me.

517
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:27,125
I am not trying to hurt you, okay?

518
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:30,254
If I was, would I drop my weapon?

519
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:31,713
I'm your friend.

520
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:36,802
Ow! Ow! Ow!

521
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:39,513
Stop hitting me.

522
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:41,557
Hitting's not okay, Josh.

523
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,975
Ow!

524
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,811
Take the shot!

525
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:48,897
- I don't have one!
- Just do it! Just take the...

526
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:59,157
Okay. Everyone's tired.
We've done lots of hitting.

527
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:01,326
It's time to talk.

528
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:13,005
Hail, hail, Blissfield High.

529
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:16,049
Chomp, chomp, chomp's our battle cry.

530
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:18,468
When our Beavers come to fight,

531
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:20,637
feel our glory and our might.

532
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,098
Yeah?

533
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:29,146
What's your favorite movie?

534
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:30,772
I tell people it's <i>Eternal Sunshine,</i>

535
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:31,899
but it's <i>Pitch Perfect 2.</i>

536
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,194
- TV show?
- <i>Sabrina.</i>

537
00:45:37,738 --> 00:45:39,948
- Favorite snack.
- Triple Berry Gushers.

538
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:43,785
Who's your biggest crush?

539
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:48,165
The Booker Hooker.

540
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:52,794
Shake, bitches.

541
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:00,636
Right?

542
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:02,763
- Oh, my God!
- Yes.

543
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,015
Oh, my God.

544
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:07,226
- Wait a minute. How did this happen?
- How is that even possible?

545
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:09,186
And guess what, I need a friend right now,

546
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:12,523
and it's like, you guys are
smashing the shit out of me.

547
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:15,943
{\an8}He stabbed me with this, like,
weird, old-looking dagger,

548
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,861
but when he stabbed me, we both got hurt.

549
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:18,946
What do you mean?

550
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:20,948
Standing and peeing is kind of rad.

551
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:22,908
- Millie, focus.
- Sorry? What?

552
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:26,995
- You both got hurt?
- Oh. Yeah.

553
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:30,249
So, when he stabbed me,
he instantly got a wound, too,

554
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:32,876
but in the exact same spot,
the left shoulder.

555
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,503
And then, late last night, I kept hearing

556
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:36,004
the dagger's name, like, this weird,

557
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:38,465
like, whispering in my head:
"La Dola, La Dola."

558
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:40,175
I think the Dola caused this.

559
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:44,137
This is, like, three gallons of pee.
This guy's bladder is huge.

560
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:45,806
- Is everything huge?
- Joshua.

561
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:48,851
Wha... You know
this is the boys' room, right?

562
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:51,645
She's got a dick in her hand,
and you're wearing Chanel No. 5.

563
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:54,398
Think we're past labels.

564
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:55,691
This is ridiculous.

565
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:58,443
You guys got to see this.
This is like a floppy anteater.

566
00:46:58,527 --> 00:46:59,570
This it?

567
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:04,324
Yes, that's it.

568
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:05,742
That's the dagger.

569
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:09,371
"La Dola, an ancient Aztecan dagger

570
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:11,832
"used in ritual sacrifice"?

571
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:13,750
- Do I wipe?
- There's writing on it.

572
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,961
I think it's Spanish.

573
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:18,589
I can't read it.

574
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,674
Aren't you in Spanish Three?

575
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:21,842
And your point?

576
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:24,720
You should be able to read Spanish.

577
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:26,972
Nobody pays attention in that class.

578
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:29,183
Why don't we get
Señora Cayenes to translate it?

579
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,733
What does it say?

580
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,207
Uh...

581
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:58,587
Señor Detmer, you are in my class.

582
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,880
Well, I'm dyslexic.

583
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,174
I have a doctor's note.

584
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:07,888
It says here, if the sacrifice
is not successful,

585
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:09,765
the souls of the two persons are swapped

586
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:14,102
and the change becomes
<i>permanente</i> after 24 hours.

587
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:16,063
Permanent?

588
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:19,274
<i>Sí.</i>

589
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:27,741
Boys are so gross.

590
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:42,923
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

591
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:44,508
I'm not a cock gobbler.

592
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,010
Hurry up, loser. I got to take a dump.

593
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:54,560
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

594
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:58,564
I... I was... I was looking for,
for someone else. I...

595
00:48:58,647 --> 00:48:59,648
Boo!

596
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:01,233
Boo!

597
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,361
How's that feel?

598
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,113
You like being scared?

599
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,073
No. I'm s... I'm sorry. I di... I thought

600
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:10,951
it was gonna be...

601
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,578
Please.

602
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:16,206
If you ever mess with Millie Kessler

603
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,751
or any other kid again, I swear,

604
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:24,256
I'll make you wish your buggy,
wormy, stupid face

605
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:26,425
was never born. Do you got it?

606
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:30,804
Oh, my God. Did you just pee yourself?

607
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:32,264
- Yes!
- Ew!

608
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,766
That's disgusting.

609
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,477
So you're saying if I don't
stab him with the Dola

610
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:39,605
by midnight, I'm gonna be stuck
in this body forever?

611
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,315
- Yep.
- That's in, like, nine hours.

612
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:44,401
- Uh, it's doable. Adjacent.
- Where's the Dola?

613
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:46,195
It's at the police station
in the evidence locker.

614
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:49,031
Then we better get going over there now.

615
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:52,367
Guys, he's here somewhere.

616
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:54,536
And he's wearing my body
and he's wearing my face.

617
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,289
He's like a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

618
00:49:57,372 --> 00:49:58,957
And if we don't capture him first,

619
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:03,045
God knows how many people he's gonna kill.

620
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,047
What kind of a name is that?

621
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:07,257
Stupid name.

622
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:13,805
Miss Kessler.

623
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:17,434
You got some nerve
stepping back in this classroom.

624
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:39,414
I'm not here for your games.

625
00:50:43,544 --> 00:50:44,711
Turn that off!

626
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,177
No!

627
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,182
Ah!

628
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:06,066
Self-defense. I had to do it.

629
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:09,444
I'll see you in the principal's office.

630
00:51:40,392 --> 00:51:43,729
That's what you get
for fucking with me, missy.

631
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:35,239
Ma'am.

632
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:43,080
Fuck off, piggies.

633
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:44,581
- Is this where he is?
- Yeah.

634
00:52:44,665 --> 00:52:46,500
He'll be getting out of woodshop.

635
00:52:48,752 --> 00:52:51,088
Whoa. What am I wearing?

636
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,049
Stop right there.

637
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:58,637
Help! Help! Oh, my God!
It's the Blissfield Butcher!

638
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,888
- Help me! Help!
- Freeze!

639
00:52:59,972 --> 00:53:02,808
- Run!
- Please help! It's him!

640
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:07,896
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Where's the car?

641
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,315
- Run!
- Hurry! Hurry!

642
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:13,193
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Get in the car!

643
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:18,532
What's wrong with it?

644
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:20,158
It's a piece of shit!
What do you want from me?

645
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:21,618
Uh, guys...

646
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:24,246
- Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hurry!

647
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:25,914
- Go. Go. Go now.
- Go, go!

648
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:28,542
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Watch out!

649
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,966
Suspect-suspect spotted in a shit heap!

650
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,176
Headed west from the high school!

651
00:53:37,259 --> 00:53:39,720
Why can't I just have a normal life?

652
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,680
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down, Nyla.

653
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:43,473
I just turned 18. I could go to prison.

654
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:45,434
Nyla, can you scooch your seat
up just a little bit?

655
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:47,144
Okay, we need a plan.

656
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:49,396
They saw us with her,
so they're gonna be looking for us now.

657
00:53:49,479 --> 00:53:52,191
- Ny, can you move up a little more?
- We need to get you a disguise, Mill.

658
00:53:52,274 --> 00:53:54,276
You can't be walking around in
those clothes with that face.

659
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,694
- Everyone knows who you are.
- Good plan.

660
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:58,488
Nyla, could you just do
just a little, teeny, teeny,

661
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:00,407
teeny, teeny, just a little bit more?

662
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,869
- You good, Mill?
- Yeah. Much better.

663
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:05,621
Suspect spotted
with two youths.

664
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:09,291
Teenagers. One Black, female,
one white, uh, excited.

665
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:11,043
Heading towards
the northwest corner of town.

666
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:14,129
Hey, what the fuck? Are you kidding me?

667
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,092
Shit.

668
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:20,802
- What?
- It's the police.

669
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,766
- Oh, my God. It's Char.
- Um...

670
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:28,894
Ooh! Up ahead, turn left.

671
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,938
- We can mix into the parking lot.
- No, that's my mom's...

672
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:33,482
- It's our best chance! Go!
- Turn!

673
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:41,114
Holy shit!

674
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:42,324
Come on!

Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

682
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,527
Millie, hide in here. Quick.

683
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,196

- Sorry. So sorry.

00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:37,546
I didn't know anybody was in there.

- So sorry.
- No problem. Okay.

690
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:40,174
You all good in there?

691
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:41,925
Yeah, uh, uh, great, actually.

692
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,177
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Sure, sure.

693
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,513
Just, uh, trying on, uh, polos.

694
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:48,348
Wow.

695
00:55:48,432 --> 00:55:52,561
I happen to be a professional
at helping men pick out polos.

696
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:54,146
- What do you say?
- Nope.

697
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:56,148
- No, actually, I'm all good.
- Don't be silly.

698
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:59,151
Everybody needs a second
opinion. How is the fit?

699
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,820
Because we have lots of sizes here.

700
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:03,947
Oh, you know what? It's so funny.

701
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:08,660
I bought my husband a pink polo
one year for Christmas,

702
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:13,081
and he about died. "Pink?" He's so macho.

703
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:15,792
But guess what. It looked great on him.

704
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:19,838
Brought out his eyes.

705
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:22,925
He had these... these blue eyes.

706
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:25,844
I bet he loved it.

707
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:30,307
I bet it was his favorite shirt.

708
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:34,645
He passed away a year ago.

709
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:39,274
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

710
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:43,028
Listen to me. Debbie Downer. I'm sorry.

711
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:45,030
I didn't mean to share all that with you.

712
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:48,200
I just... You're just...
You're trying to buy a polo,

713
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:50,494
- for God's sake. I...
- No, no, no, no. No.

714
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:53,121
No, it's okay. It's okay.

715
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:56,667
I, um... I lost somebody, too.

716
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,335
- Really?
- Yeah.

717
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:03,298
- I lost my dad.
- I'm so sorry.

718
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,094
You must miss him so much.

719
00:57:07,678 --> 00:57:09,805
Yeah, I do.

720
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:14,685
Nothing prepares you
for this stuff, right?

721
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:18,105
I mean, we're all just left here...

722
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:22,651
...to pick up the pieces and...

723
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:26,238
My oldest, she shut down.
She retreated into work.

724
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:30,868
And my other daughter, Millie,
she's so quiet now.

725
00:57:32,077 --> 00:57:34,997
I can't figure out
what's going on inside her head.

726
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:38,959
Maybe she just needs some... some space.

727
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:44,047
Just some time to figure out who she is.

728
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,175
Yeah.

729
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:49,928
I guess I do smother her.

730
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:54,892
I don't mean to. But I am scared.

731
00:57:55,726 --> 00:57:56,894
She'll be graduating high school

732
00:57:57,019 --> 00:58:00,772
and running off to college,
and then I'll be left here.

733
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:06,445
All by myself.

734
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:09,698
But that-that's never gonna happen.

735
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:13,911
She's your daughter, and...

736
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:17,164
...she loves you.

737
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,251
Thank you for that.

738
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,880
- You're so easy to talk to.
- Yeah, you're great. You're just...

739
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:28,967
Your voice, it's so... comforting

740
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:31,929
and... very manly.

741
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:36,058
I know this is awkward, uh, but...

742
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:38,769
I've had such a good time talking to you.

743
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:40,395
- Yeah, it's been...
- We hardly know each other.

744
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:41,647
- I know, I know.
- Yeah.

745
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:43,607
And I, I haven't even seen you yet

746
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:47,110
but I think we have a connection, and...

747
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:50,113
I would like to know
if maybe you would like to

748
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:51,949
grab a coffee with me sometime.

749
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:55,369
Ew. God, no.

750
00:58:56,703 --> 00:58:59,831
- No, I wouldn't, um...
- I should never have asked you.

751
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:02,292
- That was totally inappropriate.
- And so what I'm saying is,

752
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:04,253
you know, um, "Oh, no."

753
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:06,463
Like, I've missed out
because we've had a connection.

754
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:07,714
You share so beautiful.

755
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,801
And I just would love to do
more than a coffee.

756
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,513
Um, even, even, have a dinner?

757
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:17,307
- Oh. Dinner?
- Yeah, I would love that,

758
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:19,226
'cause I feel like
we know each other so well.

759
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:21,436
- You know what I mean? So it's like...
- I feel that, too.

760
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,147
A coffee wouldn't be enough
for us. But I'm married.

761
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:26,984
- Oh.
- So I'm a married man.

762
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:28,485
- Mom!
- What?

763
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:29,736
Have you talked to Millie today?

764
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,238
- No, I haven't.
- Okay. Where's your phone?

765
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,573
- No, it's in my purse.
- Go get it.

766
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,157
- Call her and make sure she's okay.
- I will!

767
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:35,576
The killer was just sighted again.

768
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:37,786
- Go. Let's go. Come on.
- Good luck to you!

769
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:46,086
What the hell is that?

770
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,380
Quick, put it on.
You're scary Aaron Rodgers now.

771
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:50,299
- Who?
- Famous quarterback.

772
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:51,967
- Green Bay Packers.
- Even I know that.

773
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,468
You know I hate sports.

774
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:58,140
This is terrifying. I can't breathe.

775
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:00,267
It's all we had time to grab.
Your sister's on our ass.

776
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,602
- Let's go.
- Come on.

777
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:04,938
I can't see shit.

778
01:00:05,022 --> 01:00:07,065
How do killers do this?

779
01:00:07,149 --> 01:00:08,942
Nyla, drive.

780
01:00:09,026 --> 01:00:10,360
I'm trolling Insta.

781
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:11,904
Somebody's got to know
where The Butcher is.

782
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:13,530
Got it.

783
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:16,200
Oh! Fuck!

784
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:22,915
Oh! Sorry. Oh, that's your face. Okay.

785
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:24,625
Okay, I'm getting this off.
I can't see anything.

786
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,084
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop.

787
01:00:26,168 --> 01:00:28,629
If you get recognized, we are screwed.

788
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:30,214
- Bingo.
- Oh, my God. What?

789
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:31,590
- Suffocating. Who's this one?
- Mill.

790
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:33,884
{\an8}- Which one's who? Who's that?
- <i>Coming at you live,</i>

791
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:37,513
{\an8}<i>Blissfield's unofficial homecoming queen.</i>

792
01:00:41,934 --> 01:00:42,976
This sucks.

793
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,729
- I want to party.
- We should throw our own homecoming.

794
01:00:45,812 --> 01:00:47,648
- Fuck The Butcher.
- Okay, sure.

795
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,942
And where are we gonna pull that off
with Larkin's curfew?

796
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:51,610
The old mill.

797
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:54,154
No one would look there.

798
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:57,491
- Hell yeah. That's genius.
- Not bad.

799
01:00:57,658 --> 01:01:01,203
Who knew little Millie Kessler
could be such a crafty beaver?

800
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:06,542
Your touch makes this pussy
drier than sandpaper,

801
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,085
you fucking monkey.

802
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:11,839
I can't wait to kill you.

803
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:21,056
She fucking wants me.

804
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,986
I'm gonna take a piss.

805
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:35,571
Okay. Sure.

806
01:01:40,826 --> 01:01:42,661
Okay, I'll go check the back.

807
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:43,912
Okay.

808
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:47,249
Oh, my God.

809
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:53,463
- He's gonna kill him.
- What?

810
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:56,550
- He's gonna kill him!
- I literally can't understand you.

811
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:59,136
Here. Divide and survive. You go that way.

812
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:17,863
Hey.

813
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,283
Hey, Millie.

814
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:23,785
Where'd you go?

815
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:28,665
Millie?

816
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:35,714
Booker?

817
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:40,427
Booker?

818
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:49,186
Fucking...

819
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:06,578
Oh!

820
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:10,207
I fucking hate this place.

821
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:34,439
Hey, Millie?

822
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:37,651
Hey, where are you?

823
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:42,030
I just w... I just want to talk.

824
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:45,659
Make sure you're okay.

825
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:55,544
Booker!

826
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:01,008
Oh, my God.

827
01:04:02,342 --> 01:04:04,428
Don't let him get away!
He'll call the cops!

828
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:08,015
Help! Help! Help!

829
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:14,855
Oh, my God.

830
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:22,529
Where the hell did you learn
how to do that?

831
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:25,032
Dad was an Eagle Scout.

832
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:27,326
Found these.

833
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:30,537
Ah.

834
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:38,170
Uh-huh. Okay.

835
01:04:45,928 --> 01:04:47,804
He's even gorgeous when he's unconscious.

836
01:04:58,857 --> 01:05:00,192
- Hey.
- Jesus Chr...

837
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:01,818
Easy, easy, easy.

838
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:03,779
It's okay. It's okay.

839
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:06,448
Look, I know I look like
The Butcher, but it's Millie.

840
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:10,452
- This is gonna sound really strange.
- Booker.

841
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:12,412
Booker, look at me. He's crazy.

842
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:14,248
Okay. Booker, can you look at me, please?

843
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:16,375
Please. Booker, please.
Can you look at me?

844
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,668
Just for a second?

845
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:20,796
Okay, so last night,
our consciousness or our spirit,

846
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:22,422
whatever you want to call it...

847
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:23,841
Okay? It traded places.

848
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:26,426
- She's telling the truth.
- So, he stabbed me with the Dola,

849
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,096
which is, like,
this ancient mystical dagger.

850
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:31,390
And now I have, like, less than
six hours to swap back,

851
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:33,225
or I'm gonna be stuck in his body forever.

852
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:36,228
You're all going to jail for this.
You, too, Booker.

853
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:38,730
Unless you help me. Booker.

854
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:42,025
- Dry up, bitch.
- Booker, help! Booker!

855
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:44,319
- Will you shut up?
- Booker.

856
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:47,281
Look, I know this is crazy, okay?
And there's a lot of voices competing.

857
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:48,991
You see my friends,
you know Nyla and Josh,

858
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,951
and they're on my side, okay?
And this is clearly not me.

859
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:52,369
Have you ever seen me dressed like that?

860
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:55,122
I mean, I kind of like
a lot of what he's doing

861
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:57,416
with it, but it's... The point
is that you've never seen me

862
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:59,126
dressed like that, right?
Do you like that?

863
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:01,461
It doesn't matter. Like, look,
I'm giving you a lot of information,

864
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:02,921
and you literally just woke up.

865
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:05,757
Whew. You look great.

866
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:08,802
- I need to get out of here.
- Booker. Booker, please.

867
01:06:08,886 --> 01:06:10,637
- Please. Please, Booker.
- No, I need to go right now.

868
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,389
You're not gonna stop me.
I'm gonna freak out, okay?

869
01:06:12,472 --> 01:06:13,765
"I'm not yours,

870
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:15,434
"not lost in you.

871
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:18,520
"Not lost, although I long to be.

872
01:06:20,898 --> 01:06:23,817
"Lost as a candle lit at noon.

873
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:28,113
"Lost as a snowflake in the sea.

874
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:32,701
"You love me, and I find you

875
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:37,331
"still a spirit, beautiful and bright.

876
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:39,958
"Yet I am, who long to be

877
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:45,088
"lost as light is lost in light.

878
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:49,718
"Plunge me deep into love.

879
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:53,263
"Put away my senses.

880
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:54,932
"Leave me deaf and blind,

881
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:59,102
"swept by the tempest of your love...

882
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,148
"...a taper...

883
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:06,735
in the rushing wind."

884
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:09,488
How?

885
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:12,824
I told you it was a curse.

886
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:15,285
Um...

887
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,246
What the hell was that?

888
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:21,208
A few weeks ago,
I found a poem in my locker.

889
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:24,628
It was anonymous.

890
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:28,465
I don't know why I did it. I just was...

891
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:32,010
You know, it was...

892
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:34,096
It was just stupid.

893
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:38,892
You sad fucking cunt.

894
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:45,065
A poem in his locker?

895
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:49,778
You pathetic coward.

896
01:07:56,285 --> 01:08:00,664
{\an8}- That's quite enough of that.
- This should be his new mug shot.

897
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:02,291
{\an8}Mmm.

898
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:04,751
Stop messing around.

899
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:11,550
{\an8}So the Dola's here at the station.

900
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:13,385
We're gonna have to figure out
how to steal it

901
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:14,553
and then get it back here.

902
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:16,095
That's, like, 40 minutes round-trip.

903
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:19,725
There's plenty of time, right?

904
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:21,518
Uh, that's assuming
there's someone at the station.

905
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:22,685
Hmm.

906
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:24,938
I mean, with them looking for us
and the party tonight,

907
01:08:25,022 --> 01:08:27,064
- the cops could have their hands full.
- Hmm.

908
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:29,109
- Where's the party?
- It's at the old mill.

909
01:08:29,193 --> 01:08:31,278
That's where I woke up in this body.

910
01:08:31,904 --> 01:08:34,823
He's luring them there. That's a trap.

911
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:37,408
- Then we better get moving.
- And what about her?

912
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:39,453
- Pronouns.
- Christ, what about him?

913
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:41,078
My mom's out of town until Monday.

914
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:42,747
Yeah. No, I don't think it's a good idea

915
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:44,457
- to leave him here alone.
- No, he's right.

916
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:46,251
Someone needs to stay behind
and keep an eye on him

917
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:48,295
- just in case.
- Mmm-hmm.

918
01:08:52,006 --> 01:08:54,176
- What? Me?
- It's your house.

919
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:55,301
Definitely gonna die this time.

920
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:56,886
Chill out. You'll be fine.

921
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:01,767
Wait. Wait, guys.

922
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,437
Great.

923
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,147
Leave me alone with Murder Barbie.

924
01:09:17,616 --> 01:09:18,992
Okay, guys. He's gone.

925
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:23,497
- That's Char's car.
- You guys stay here.

926
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,666
Honk the horn twice
if you see anything, okay?

927
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:27,792
What's your plan?

928
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:29,795
Don't worry about it.

929
01:09:29,877 --> 01:09:31,462
I got this. Yeah.

930
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:41,390
I've never been so stressed and excited
at the same time in my life.

931
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:44,475
Hashtag "stress-cited."

932
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:47,938
Hashtag "nerves of steel."

933
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:51,358
Hashtag "What's she doing?"

934
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:54,111
Oh, my God. Char, help me!

935
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:56,405
Nyla. What the hell is going on?

936
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:57,990
You were spotted with The Butcher.

937
01:09:58,073 --> 01:09:59,908
He kidnapped us.
He made us drive him. I...

938
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:02,703
I escaped, but he followed me here.

939
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:04,746
- Wait. He's here?
- Outside, behind the station.

940
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:07,332
Okay, okay. Just, just stay here, okay?

941
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:08,417
- Hide under my desk.
- Okay.

942
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,668
Go! Go, go, go!

943
01:10:15,132 --> 01:10:16,550
That's so crazy.

944
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:21,388
But, you know, I have to admit,
in a really strange way,

945
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:23,307
that it hasn't been all bad.

946
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,725
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

947
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:26,560
It's just, you know,

948
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:30,063
I felt oddly empowered being in this body.

949
01:10:31,481 --> 01:10:33,775
Like, invincible

950
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:35,903
or kind of badass.

951
01:10:38,071 --> 01:10:39,615
I know. It's, um...

952
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:42,075
I mean, it's ridiculous, but, uh...

953
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:44,912
I guess when you're, uh...

954
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:48,248
When you're someone like me and you,

955
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:51,752
you know, you've been bullied
most of your life

956
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:55,714
and, you know, sort of
just put down a lot, that,

957
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:58,967
you know, it does feel kind of good to

958
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:02,137
just feel strong for once.

959
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:06,016
Strength doesn't come from size.

960
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:08,977
It doesn't. It comes from up here

961
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,313
and in there.

962
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:14,191
And you are a lot stronger than you think.

963
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:19,738
- <i>Hello.</i>
- <i>Oh, whoa! Oh!</i>

964
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:21,657
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

965
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:28,997
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- <i>What happened?</i>

966
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:30,499
- <i>Luann, are you okay?</i>
- <i>This one's a live one.</i>

967
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:32,417
- <i>I know. Hold on.</i>
- <i>Are you okay?</i>

968
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,711
That nasty stare does not scare me.

969
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:36,213
<i>He just started
trying to buck me off.</i>

970
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:39,758
<i>The Blissfield Rotary Club presents...</i>

971
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:43,679
- Ha.
- ...WICKED <i>live at the Anis Theater.</i>

972
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:46,640
<i>Get your tickets before they fly away.</i>

973
01:11:46,723 --> 01:11:48,559
<i>Ladies,
we've all been there.</i>

974
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:50,727
- Just...
- <i>Can't get those corns...</i>

975
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:52,312
- ...don't move.
- <i>...into that new pair of shoes?</i>

976
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:54,690
<i>Well, introducing Corn Erase.</i>

977
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:56,441
<i>You apply the cream all over the bunion,</i>

978
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:58,485
<i>and within minutes,
the deep-penetrating...</i>

979
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:04,491
Hello!

980
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:07,619
Joshy!

981
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:11,039
Josh.

982
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,542
Hi, Mom.

983
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:15,294
You're home early.

984
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:16,920
My last flight got canceled.

985
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:20,340
Honey, why is Millie
tied to my dining chair?

986
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:22,467
Um, she...

987
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:25,470
We, um,

988
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:27,389
role-play.

989
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:30,642
- Mmm?
- I'm sorry?

990
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:33,437
- We're role-playing.
- Role-playing?

991
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,230
Yes, role-playing.

992
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,399
- Like a game?
- Sort of.

993
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:41,695
She doesn't look like
she's enjoying herself.

994
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:43,030
- No.
- Oh.

995
01:12:43,113 --> 01:12:44,948
Oh, um, that, that's the point.

996
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:46,867
She's, she's supposed to act upset.

997
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:49,661
Right, Millie?

998
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:52,915
She's method. Never breaks character.

999
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:55,834
Naughty girl!

1000
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:00,923
<i>He's eating my bracelet!</i>

1001
01:13:01,006 --> 01:13:02,716
I'm a little confused.

1002
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:06,011
Isn't role-playing...

1003
01:13:06,637 --> 01:13:08,347
...a sex game?

1004
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:11,892
- Is it?
- Mmm-hmm.

1005
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:15,521
Yes. Yes, it is.

1006
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:16,688
Mmm-hmm. Yep.

1007
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:18,190
So...

1008
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:20,108
Okay, um,

1009
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:24,488
Mom, I didn't want to tell you
until I was ready,

1010
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:28,867
but I'm straight.

1011
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:36,291
Joshua, you are many things,
but straight isn't one of them.

1012
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:38,418
Now, do me a favor and untie her.

1013
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:39,795
- I can't.
- Joshua!

1014
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:41,129
Mom, I'm sorry.

1015
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:43,006
I can't explain right now,
but I cannot let him go.

1016
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,258
- "Him"?
- No. Mom.

1017
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:45,509
Mom, Mom, Mom, listen to me.

1018
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:46,802
He's the Blissfield Butcher!

1019
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:48,929
God! Joshua Michael Detmer,

1020
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:51,515
I've been slinging peanuts
to assholes all week.

1021
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:52,599
I don't have time for this.

1022
01:13:52,683 --> 01:13:54,017
No. Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom, don't.

1023
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,561
How did you even do this? Ow!

1024
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:57,521
Run!

1025
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:04,152
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1026
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:13,787
No, no, no, no, no! Go for the windows!

1027
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:14,872
- Make sure they're locked!
- Okay!

1028
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,472
- What?
- Nyla, he's escaped!

1029
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:33,557
What?

1030
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,809
Body's fucking useless!

1031
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:41,899
I couldn't find him.
Are you sure he followed you?

1032
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:43,567
Yes, I'm sure he did. I swear he...

1033
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:45,444
He took us, and, and...

1034
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:46,570
Nyla.

1035
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:50,949
What the fuck is going on?

1036
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:55,037
Don't you dare answer that.

1037
01:14:57,331 --> 01:15:00,459
- I can explain.
- Nyla, this is serious.

1038
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,379
- Put your hands up.
- Please, just let me explain.

1039
01:15:04,463 --> 01:15:06,256
Hands up! Now!

1040
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:13,305
I want you to slowly set the weapon down.

1041
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:19,895
Now kick it over to me.

1042
01:15:23,607 --> 01:15:25,651
Hey, do you mind if I come back there?

1043
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:29,905
- Sure.
- Yeah?

1044
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:34,493
My God.

1045
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:39,498
Right. I felt so far away.

1046
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:46,338
- Hmm.
- So,

1047
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,383
- about that poem...
- Oh, my gosh.

1048
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:51,635
Please don't bring that up.
That was a total mistake.

1049
01:15:51,718 --> 01:15:53,679
That was a mistake?

1050
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:54,972
What? You accidentally wrote it

1051
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,474
and you were just going by my locker,
and you tripped, and it fell in?

1052
01:15:57,558 --> 01:15:59,518
Yes, exactly. That's what happened.

1053
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:04,106
Well, I thought it was beautiful.

1054
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:05,440
The poem.

1055
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:08,402
Probably read it, like, a hundred times.

1056
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:09,611
Really?

1057
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:14,157
Yeah. I mean, once I got over
how creepy it was finding it, yeah.

1058
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:17,828
- Sorry.
- I'm kidding.

1059
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:23,000
I actually kind of hoped
that it was your poem.

1060
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:26,044
No, you didn't.

1061
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:30,299
Millie,

1062
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:33,260
I've liked you since day one.

1063
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:39,474
You don't have to say that.

1064
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:42,603
I know I don't. That's why I did.

1065
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:53,655
How weird is it that I kind of feel like
kissing you right now?

1066
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:06,793
Technically,

1067
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:10,714
you'd be kissing a mass murderer
with yellow teeth.

1068
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:14,676
You're still Millie to me.

1069
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:25,521
Maybe we should wait for when my hand's

1070
01:17:25,604 --> 01:17:27,231
- not bigger than your whole face.
- Yeah. No, no, no.

1071
01:17:27,314 --> 01:17:29,483
That's okay. That's...
It's, it's whenever you want.

1072
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,568
I'm not going anywhere.

1073
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:40,786
Fuck!

1074
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:44,456
Millie, where the fuck have you been?

1075
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,458
- I have been calling you all day.
- What?

1076
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,544
I've been calling you, too.

1077
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:51,255
- That is not your sister.
- Nyla, shut the fuck up.

1078
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:52,339
Okay.

1079
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,299
What is going on here?

1080
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:55,759
Millie, stay out of this.

1081
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:57,845
- I'm just trying to help.
- I don't need your help, okay?

1082
01:17:57,928 --> 01:17:59,179
- I'm just trying to help!
- I don't need your fucking help.

1083
01:17:59,263 --> 01:18:00,347
Back the fuck up.

1084
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:02,266
Char!

1085
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:06,436
Run, Millie!

1086
01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:08,480
Get your hands up. Hands up now!

1087
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:14,653
Come on, Nyla. Pick up the fucking phone!

1088
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:19,116
Charlene.

1089
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,826
Charlene! Charlene!

1090
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,536
Over here! Charlene!

1091
01:18:23,245 --> 01:18:24,288
Oh, my God!

1092
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:27,332
Start walking towards the cell.

1093
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,293
Come on!

1094
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:36,633
- Can you listen to me?
- Now!

1095
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:45,100
Nyla, don't you fucking move!

1096
01:18:57,863 --> 01:18:59,031
Get in.

1097
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:01,158
- Can you please listen to me?
- Move!

1098
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,161
Hey!

1099
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:07,873
- No!
- I'm so sorry.

1100
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:09,583
- Oh, my God! No!
- Char, I'm so sorry.

1101
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,667
No!

1102
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:13,962
- You motherfucker! Get me out!
- I really thought

1103
01:19:14,046 --> 01:19:16,715
your hamster could swim,
and I'm so sorry that Regal died.

1104
01:19:16,798 --> 01:19:19,009
But this is all gonna
make sense to you later on.

1105
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:20,719
I got to run. I'm so sorry.
I love you! Mwah!

1106
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:21,803
Guys, we gotta go!

1107
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:23,180
- We can't let him get away!
- Let's go, let's go!

1108
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:24,389
Your plan's the fucking worst.

1109
01:19:26,183 --> 01:19:29,353
- Are you okay?
- Your sister's a shitty driver.

1110
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:30,854
That's not Char, that's the Butcher

1111
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:32,481
- and he's got the Dola.
- What?

1112
01:19:32,564 --> 01:19:33,565
Come on, guys. Let's go!

1113
01:19:50,123 --> 01:19:52,501
Yo-ho-ho, Millie Vanilli.

1114
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:54,253
Where's my boy Booker?

1115
01:19:54,336 --> 01:19:55,921
Thought you guys were together.

1116
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:57,673
Okay.

1117
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:06,932
So, you think
you're this hot shit now, huh?

1118
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:11,061
You know, I've never made
anyone's pussy dry.

1119
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:12,145
I mean, look at me.

1120
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:16,567
Oh, now you like it.

1121
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:19,820
All right, come on.

1122
01:20:27,286 --> 01:20:28,287
Wait, wait.

1123
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:31,915
Looks clear.

1124
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:33,000
Let's go.

1125
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:34,751
You guys stay here.

1126
01:20:35,711 --> 01:20:37,045
This is way too dangerous.

1127
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:39,464
There is no way
we're not helping you, Mill.

1128
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:40,549
We're in this together.

1129
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:43,385
Thirteen minutes left.

1130
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:46,054
Or you're the Butcher forever.

1131
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:48,599
Hey, come here, give me your wrist.

1132
01:20:49,266 --> 01:20:50,267
Let me set a timer.

1133
01:20:51,268 --> 01:20:52,269
Oh, okay.

1134
01:20:58,317 --> 01:21:00,110
Time to stab this asshole.

1135
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:15,083
Well, what do you know? Looks like we got

1136
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:16,877
a little private party going here, huh?

1137
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:20,464
Uh, are you good at math, Millie?

1138
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,509
'Cause the way I see it,

1139
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:27,679
you have three holes, and it all adds up.

1140
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:41,902
Will make it easier.

1141
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:43,195
There we go.

1142
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,323
What the fuck?

1143
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:04,258
What the fuck did you do to
my friends, you fucking bitch?

1144
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:11,682
What are you doing?

1145
01:22:14,059 --> 01:22:15,102
Whoa, whoa, look. Hey, whoa, whoa.

1146
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:18,188
What are you doing? Stop. No, no, no.

1147
01:22:19,898 --> 01:22:20,941
Don't.

1148
01:22:21,984 --> 01:22:24,111
Please. I'm sorry.
Please, please, please, please, no.

1149
01:22:24,194 --> 01:22:25,279
I'm sorry!

1150
01:22:25,362 --> 01:22:26,738
Look, I'm sorry!

1151
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:27,906
I'm sorry! Please!

1152
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:31,702
Shit, it's packed.

1153
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:35,122
We'll search in pairs.
Text if you see him.

1154
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:36,957
Do not try and be a hero.

1155
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,168
- Be careful, Mill.
- You, too.

1156
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:49,803
Hey, hey, hey. What's up?

1157
01:22:49,887 --> 01:22:51,638
Have you seen Millie?

1158
01:22:51,722 --> 01:22:53,390
Uh, Millie, Millie.

1159
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:54,516
Millie.

1160
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,269
Oh, yeah. I, uh... I saw her.

1161
01:22:57,352 --> 01:22:59,479
- Really? Where?
- Uh, this way.

1162
01:22:59,563 --> 01:23:01,273
Come on. Come on.

1163
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:03,400
Come on.

1164
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:09,114
I'm not gonna make it.

1165
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:11,200
Hey, don't say that. There's still time.

1166
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:13,911
Sh...

1167
01:23:17,581 --> 01:23:18,665
Oh, my God.

1168
01:23:20,584 --> 01:23:22,794
Hey, hey! He's here!
He killed Brett and the others.

1169
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:25,172
- What? Where's Millie?
- Uh, she went to find Joshua.

1170
01:23:28,217 --> 01:23:29,218
Oh, shit.

1171
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:36,016
Where is she?

1172
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:38,560
You said you knew where she was.

1173
01:23:38,644 --> 01:23:40,562
She's somewhere.

1174
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:43,565
Millie, Millie.

1175
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:46,944
Millie, Millie, Millie. Millie, Millie.

1176
01:23:50,948 --> 01:23:53,158
Phil, I don't have time for this. Where...

1177
01:23:58,497 --> 01:23:59,581
Loser faggot.

1178
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:00,666
Wow!

1179
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:02,376
So self-aware. Bravo.

1180
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,878
You tell anybody, I'll fucking kill you.

1181
01:24:16,431 --> 01:24:17,474
Josh!

1182
01:24:21,687 --> 01:24:23,230
- Get out of here.
- No!

1183
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:25,357
- What are you doing?
- Go!

1184
01:24:31,655 --> 01:24:33,198
I want my body back.

1185
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:35,534
Come and get it.

1186
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:37,828
Hey. Hey. We found him.

1187
01:24:37,911 --> 01:24:39,663
- He's gonna kill Millie.
- Right, go help her.

1188
01:24:39,746 --> 01:24:41,415
- I'll slow them down.
- Stop right there!

1189
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:42,583
Come on.

1190
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:09,109
Stop! I'm trying to stab myself!

1191
01:25:10,068 --> 01:25:11,320
- Drop the knife!
- Shoot him!

1192
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,035
Come back with my fucking body!

1193
01:25:38,722 --> 01:25:39,723
Catch!

1194
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:42,518
Hold him down.

1195
01:25:52,611 --> 01:25:53,904
No.

1196
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:01,161
You're too late.

1197
01:26:14,508 --> 01:26:15,676
Wait.

1198
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:18,053
- Where's the bell?
- What?

1199
01:26:18,136 --> 01:26:21,014
The bell, uh, it didn't toll.

1200
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,103
Pro tip.

1201
01:26:26,645 --> 01:26:28,605
Always set your watch five minutes ahead.

1202
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:30,315
Saves my ass, like, every time.

1203
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:33,527
Hold him down.

1204
01:26:34,778 --> 01:26:37,656
No! No! No! No!

1205
01:27:02,472 --> 01:27:03,473
Millie?

1206
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,143
Who's your favorite athlete?

1207
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:08,187
- They're over there!
- Hey!

1208
01:27:09,521 --> 01:27:11,106
No one. I hate sports.

1209
01:27:12,858 --> 01:27:13,859
Freeze!

1210
01:27:15,152 --> 01:27:16,486
Shoot that motherfucker!

1211
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:49,811
Um, what the fuck just happened?

1212
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:52,356
That's real.

1213
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:58,820
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

1214
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:02,115
Time to land that plane, girl.

1215
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:05,452
Hi.

1216
01:28:07,913 --> 01:28:09,373
How's the shoulder?

1217
01:28:09,998 --> 01:28:12,835
Honestly, the best pain I've ever felt.

1218
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:19,383
So, what are you gonna tell the cops?

1219
01:28:21,301 --> 01:28:23,303
A version of the truth, I guess.

1220
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:29,268
Let's just hope nobody ever gets
their hands on that thing again.

1221
01:28:34,022 --> 01:28:35,065
What?

1222
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:38,944
So,

1223
01:28:39,903 --> 01:28:42,155
that thing

1224
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,450
we were trying to do earlier.

1225
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:47,119
Oh.

1226
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:48,203
Oh!

1227
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:52,332
Oh, are we, are we ready
to try that again?

1228
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:54,084
I don't know. Let's see. Let's...

1229
01:29:00,382 --> 01:29:02,176
- That's much better.
- Mmm.

1230
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:14,646
Yeah, Mill!

1231
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:18,400
Millie!

1232
01:29:19,318 --> 01:29:20,569
- Mom?
- Oh.

1233
01:29:22,613 --> 01:29:26,283
Oh, Millie, you're okay. I was so worried.

1234
01:29:41,215 --> 01:29:42,925
His pulse and heart rate are weak.

1235
01:29:43,675 --> 01:29:45,469
I don't think he's gonna make it.

1236
01:29:45,552 --> 01:29:46,970
Good.

1237
01:29:47,054 --> 01:29:48,639
How empathetic.

1238
01:29:48,722 --> 01:29:51,642
If you'd seen the carnage,
you'd be glad, too.

1239
01:29:55,354 --> 01:29:57,064
Looks like you got your wish.

1240
01:30:09,493 --> 01:30:11,119
I'm tired. I'm gonna hit the sack.

1241
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:12,454
Good night, Char.

1242
01:30:13,038 --> 01:30:14,081
Hey.

1243
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:16,375
I love you, sis.

1244
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,878
I love you, too, stinker.

1245
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:24,258
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, Charlene.

1246
01:30:32,683 --> 01:30:33,851
So,

1247
01:30:34,852 --> 01:30:37,896
that application to Boston,

1248
01:30:40,816 --> 01:30:42,276
I want you to go.

1249
01:30:47,823 --> 01:30:49,700
It's okay. I don't need to go.

1250
01:30:50,576 --> 01:30:51,869
You're my daughter.

1251
01:30:52,536 --> 01:30:53,829
Nothing will ever change that.

1252
01:30:55,956 --> 01:30:57,708
Live your life, Millie.

1253
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:02,045
Thanks, Mom.

1254
01:31:45,589 --> 01:31:46,757
Char!

1255
01:31:47,299 --> 01:31:49,176
You left the door open again.

1256
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:55,182
Char?

1257
01:32:04,191 --> 01:32:05,192
Hello?

1258
01:33:21,185 --> 01:33:22,895
What's the matter, Millie?

1259
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:25,814
You got what you wanted, right?

1260
01:33:26,732 --> 01:33:28,567
You got your body back.

1261
01:33:29,776 --> 01:33:30,986
Why aren't you happy?

1262
01:33:31,653 --> 01:33:32,905
Freeze!

1263
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:38,869
Little girls shouldn't play with guns.

1264
01:33:45,292 --> 01:33:46,418
Run, Millie! Run!

1265
01:34:15,072 --> 01:34:16,323
Well, don't stop.

1266
01:34:17,658 --> 01:34:18,700
Keep coming.

1267
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:26,333
I've been in your body.

1268
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:29,336
I understand why you feel so weak.

1269
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:30,963
Why you feel so meager.

1270
01:34:31,755 --> 01:34:33,966
And all that anxiety that you got.

1271
01:34:36,051 --> 01:34:37,344
Clinging to your dead dad.

1272
01:34:38,303 --> 01:34:40,556
You're really just
a lesser version of her.

1273
01:34:41,223 --> 01:34:43,934
And having to take all those orders
from some drunk mom.

1274
01:34:44,017 --> 01:34:45,894
Ah! God! Ah!

1275
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:50,315
That's not a life.

1276
01:34:51,149 --> 01:34:52,150
But it's all right.

1277
01:34:53,986 --> 01:34:55,279
It's okay.

1278
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:57,197
We'll fix it.

1279
01:35:05,205 --> 01:35:06,623
You know...

1280
01:35:11,461 --> 01:35:13,589
I learned something
when I was in your body, too.

1281
01:35:13,672 --> 01:35:14,798
What's that?

1282
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:18,802
Having balls sucks.

1283
01:35:20,888 --> 01:35:22,014
Take my hand!

1284
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,100
Millie!

1285
01:35:49,374 --> 01:35:50,375
Damn, Mill.

1286
01:35:58,008 --> 01:36:00,135
I am a fucking piece.

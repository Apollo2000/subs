1
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,926
I mean that if
you made more effort,

2
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,663
you may get a man
to ask you out.

3
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,398
I don't want a man
to ask me out.

4
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,269
You know, 80% of women

5
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,298
who say they are too busy
to have a relationship,

6
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,741
are really lonely,
Audrey.

7
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,335
You know, I don't
feel the need to date

8
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,347
just to stay on the right
side of a survey.

9
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,315
- And it's bad for your skin.
- What?

10
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,044
My skin is always better
when I'm dating.

11
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,574
You're never not dating.

12
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,314
And just look
at my complexion.

13
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,447
- You, on the other hand...
- I, on the other hand,

14
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,788
have stopped having
this conversation.

15
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,554
Oh my God, is this it?

16
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,221
It's an extraordinary
townhouse

17
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,823
with a total floor space
of 9,000 square feet,

18
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,731
not including the garden.

19
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,326
May I ask what you do?

20
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,303
It depends on the occasion.

21
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,772
And your friend?

22
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,105
I'm just along for the ride.

23
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,043
This view
of the dining room

24
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,514
was recently featured
in Manhattan Interiors Magazine.

25
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,949
Oh. What was
hanging there?

26
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,816
Uh, John Sargent.

27
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,617
Yeah, Mr. Harrison has
an amazing art collection.

28
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,556
Too bad none of it
comes with the townhouse.

29
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,890
Now if you'll
follow me this way.

30
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,191
Now this ceiling
was actually handcrafted

31
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,562
by the great-grandson
of Charles Thorpe.

32
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,032
That wasn't cheap.

33
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,831
I guess it pays to be
the emperor of infomercials.

34
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,929
Mr. Harrison made $30 million
off "The Hair Houdini" alone.

35
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,565
That much?
Oh my God.

36
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,099
Now if you'll follow me
to the main bedroom.

37
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,805
Know what, Sara? I don't think
this is the place for you.

38
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,404
It's kind of...

39
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,915
cramped.

40
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,816
- Cramped?
- Well, it was all I could think of.

41
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,013
Besides, I had
everything I needed.

42
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:18,455
So, the Sargents
in the dining room are gone,

43
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,788
the Cassatt
in the living room

44
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,259
has been replaced
by a lithograph,

45
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,888
number 139 of 150 run.

46
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,024
Over the grand piano is a framed poster
of the East Hampton Film Festival.

47
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,001
Somewhat less valuable than the Sisley
that was hanging there,

48
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,561
and whatever those
monstrosities are in the hallway...

49
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,835
if they're Francis Bacon,
I'm a Jimmy Dean sausage.

50
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,774
Yes, sir...

51
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,243
Mr. Harrison's scam
is going to unravel

52
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,144
and I will get
millions off him.

53
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,206
But for someone else.
See, that's the part I don't get.

54
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,411
- Where's the pleasure?
- Winning.

55
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,357
- Thanks for today, Mom.
- Shh... Audrey.

56
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,121
I've asked you not to use
that word in public!

57
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,363
That two-faced,
lying son-of-a-bastard!

58
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,867
Mary, you know
I don't like spouse bashing.

59
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,631
This happens all the time.
He may have hidden them, sold them...

60
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,036
we'll find out.

61
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,869
Luckily, I've dealt
with Tom Hoffman,

62
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,932
the opposing counsel,
in similar situations.

63
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,501
He's a good lawyer,
but I'm wise to his game.

64
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,812
Hmm.

65
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,412
What does this mean?
Is it bad?

66
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,354
No, it doesn't
mean anything.

67
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,381
It just means that your husband
has a hired a new attorney, that's all.

68
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,417
His name is
Daniel Rafferty.

69
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,156
- I've never heard of him.
- Me neither.

70
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,424
He's new in town.

71
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,625
- This makes me nervous.
- Oh, relax.

72
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,634
You have nothing
to worry about.

73
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,727
A new attorney who has
never practiced in New York

74
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,001
will never get up to speed
this late in the game, okay?

75
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,473
You have nothing
to worry about.

76
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,341
I have never
lost one of these.

77
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,972
It's fine, it's fine.

78
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,777
It's okay.
It's not a problem.

79
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,114
It's okay, everything's okay.

80
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,119
You're all right.

81
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,659
Okay.

82
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,467
Ready?

83
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,573
That's Gary's
new attorney?

84
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,806
Audrey Woods.
I'm representing Mrs. Harrison.

85
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,613
- Audrey Woods.
- Right, for Mrs. Harrison.

86
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,313
I've heard good things.

87
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,481
That felt nice,
by the way.

88
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,424
I realize you're just starting
to familiarize yourself with the case,

89
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,324
but I wanted to make you
aware that... what?

90
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,386
Er, you got a little...
right here.

91
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,465
Uh, thank you.
Anyway, as I was saying,

92
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,127
um, it has come to our attention
that certain assets

93
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,865
accumulated, uh...
accumulated during the marriage

94
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,805
have not been accounted for,

95
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,671
so I have come
to what I believe

96
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,938
is an accurate estimate of the...
of the missing...

97
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:25,966
Snoball.

98
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,139
I don't settle.

99
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,445
I didn't mention settling.

100
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,474
Unless of course
you'd like to give me uh...

101
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,486
let me see...

102
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,449
...this.

103
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,619
Which is what I'll earn
for this trial... plus expenses.

104
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,458
Then we've got something
to talk about.

105
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,590
- You must be joking.
- Gave it a shot. Good luck.

106
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,566
Ms. Woods, is it?

107
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,301
- Hey, Daniel.
- Good morning. Good morning.

108
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,403
Good news...
opposing counsel's insane.

109
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,395
All rise.
532 is now in session.

110
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,839
Please be seated
and come to order.

111
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,903
Judge Abramovitz
divorced... horribly.

112
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,435
Very tough on men.

113
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,607
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

114
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,942
Mr. Rafferty,

115
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,954
I see you're back
on the East Coast.

116
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,513
I told you the California sun
is hard on the skin.

117
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,493
Yes, but, uh, I did moisturize
as per your instructions, Your Honor.

118
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,027
I'll hear opening arguments.

119
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,068
Your honor, I would like
to move for a continuance.

120
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,335
It's come to our attention
that discrepancies exist

121
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,935
concerning the reporting of assets...
namely, several valuable works of art.

122
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,377
Uh, may I interject,
Your Honor?

123
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,281
Uh, you mean, um, paintings,
sculpture, that kind of stuff?

124
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,148
Exactly.

125
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,723
Paintings like this?

126
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,725
Actually, yes.

127
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,556
Like this, uh, Sisley

128
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,256
or this Morisot?

129
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,868
And what have we here?
Oh, John Sargent.

130
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,665
Yes, not my kind of thing.

131
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,138
If I was him, I would have
given them away too.

132
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:37,040
Which is exactly
what Mr. Harrison did.

133
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,067
All of these.
A while ago.

134
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,205
Anonymously, of course,
to a very prominent museum.

135
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,809
I'm surprised that Mrs. Harrison didn't
tell you about this, Ms. Woods.

136
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,752
See, her, uh, signature's
on the donation document.

137
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,483
Right there.

138
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,986
Oh, uh, that reminds me,
Your Honor,

139
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,553
um, I'd like to move
for a continuance.

140
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,793
I've just been retained
as Mr. Harrison's counsel,

141
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,698
and I haven't had time
to fully research

142
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,703
all aspects of the case.

143
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,399
For instance,
I have a um...

144
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,533
a receipt here...

145
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:13,705
for six 28-day stays
at the Piney Woods rehab center

146
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,807
for Mrs. Harrison's
treatment of sexual addiction.

147
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,482
I'd like to get
to the bottom of that.

148
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,753
- I'll give you one week.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

149
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,832
Six months
for sexual addiction?

150
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,993
My therapist
was very good.

151
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,697
We have to talk.

152
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,696
It's not my fault
that Mary Harrison

153
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,674
has the IQ
of a dinner plate.

154
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,074
I'd have found out that
Harrison disposed of the art.

155
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,079
I mean, that's why
I asked for the continuance.

156
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,910
It's just that this Rafferty
guy beat me to it.

157
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,176
You want him dead?

158
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,081
- Oh, Mother.
- I meant socially.

159
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,712
I don't know, I've never been
up against anyone like him.

160
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,746
He's very un... something.

161
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,554
I can't tell if he just
got lucky or he's...

162
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,493
really, really good.

163
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,894
- Maybe he's both.
- Thank you, Mother.

164
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,625
What are you eating?

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,059
Vegetables.

166
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:13,003
- Is this Rafferty guy cute?
- I didn't notice.

167
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,166
Besides, he's not your type.
He's old enough to drive.

168
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,141
Quick, Channel 6.

169
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,642
...ln court today
were opening arguments

170
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,706
in the divorce
of Gary "Gadget" Harrison.

171
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,376
- Channel 6, Mom.
- Harrison is being sued...

172
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,822
...at stake...
a reported $97 million.

173
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,654
We caught up with Harrison's
attorney Daniel Rafferty

174
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,957
earlier today
outside the courthouse.

175
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,623
Well, we do feel
that Mrs. Harrison's

176
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,154
monetary demands
are outrageous.

177
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,292
After all,
it's Mr. Harrison's products

178
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,701
that come with a money-back guarantee,
not Mr. Harrison.

179
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,037
That's incredible. He just got into town
and he's already working the press.

180
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,943
- And you didn't notice if he's cute?
- Shh, call me later.

181
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,469
Quite frankly, after
this morning's opening...

182
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,879
She takes after her father.

183
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,248
The prenuptial
will stand as agreed.

184
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,186
Mrs. Harrison's case has
about as much chance as a...

185
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,553
uh, snowball in hell.

186
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,451
Okay, Mr. Rafferty...

187
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,190
I accept.

188
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,437
Why am I not surprised?

189
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,707
Hello?

190
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,770
Mr. Rafferty?

191
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,779
Hello?

192
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,402
Thanks, Benny.

193
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,135
Anymore arrive, just put them
outside my door, okay?

194
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,680
- Oh... oh, uh!
- Hey.

195
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,286
Oh, sorry.
Pardon me.

196
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:25,288
- Wait, wait, I'm walking here!
- Hey, you looking to die, lady?

197
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,561
And very kindly stepping in
at the last minute for Erin Swedland,

198
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,170
one of New York's
most successful attorneys;

199
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:37,198
first in her class at Yale, and partner
at Katz, Cohen & Phelps...

200
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,177
Audrey Woods.

201
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,185
Sorry.

202
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,618
Sorry.

203
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,257
Small world, eh?

204
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:02,961
And another counselor kind enough
to step in at the last minute.

205
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,199
Some say there's
method in his madness.

206
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,366
Some say
madness is his method.

207
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,536
He's practiced in Chicago,
Boston, Los Angeles.

208
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,308
And I guess practice
makes perfect...

209
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,680
because he's never
lost a case.

210
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,618
The "late"
Daniel Rafferty.

211
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,451
Mmm.

212
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,093
Do you always look
like an unmade bed?

213
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,098
Uh-oh.

214
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,498
You've either taken
an immediate dislike to me

215
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,765
for some inexplicable reason,
or you're flirting with me.

216
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,601
- Which is it?
- I'll give you hint.

217
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,574
You're getting warm
with the first one.

218
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,237
- What was the second one again?
- What are you doing here?

219
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,246
At least you could be
a bit more grateful.

220
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,180
Grateful for what?

221
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,184
Well, my old friend Lyman over there
needed a replacement.

222
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,743
He asked me if I knew
an interesting lawyer.

223
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,087
I happen to think
you're very interesting.

224
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,183
- You?
- Mmm.

225
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,990
- Please welcome our first panelist...
- I'm here because of you?

226
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,826
...Audrey Woods.

227
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,456
You're up.

228
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,706
So my advice to you is

229
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,075
divorce doesn't
have to be agony.

230
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,946
Look at it as a chance to examine
the complex emotional labyrinth

231
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,942
that is the human relationship.

232
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,925
- Well done, well done.
- Thanks, Ms. Woods, very enlightening.

233
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,663
- Like a nibble?
- You raise some interesting points.

234
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,692
No?

235
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,603
And now, let's hear
from Daniel Rafferty.

236
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,937
Mmm, that's me.
Any sno-bits?

237
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,444
Hi.

238
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,482
Thank you very much.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

239
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,078
Ah, wonderful speech,
Ms. Woods.

240
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,888
But, uh, this is
the way I see it.

241
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,086
Lawyers are scum.

242
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,619
Divorce lawyers though...

243
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:15,360
are the fungus
growing beneath the scum.

244
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,529
Divorce is the post mortem
of a dead marriage.

245
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,596
We represent people who have
suddenly discovered a passion

246
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,700
for a fight that they never
knew they had in them.

247
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,144
Where was that
passion and fight

248
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,479
when it was needed
to save the marriage?

249
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,984
Hmm?

250
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,509
Don't ask.
It's not our jobs.

251
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,545
Everyone loves gadgets.

252
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,056
And the way divorce
is going these days,

253
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,524
you're going to get
a chance to use them.

254
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,049
State-of-the-art stuff

255
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:46,463
for tracking the philandering husband
or the unfaithful wife.

256
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,864
For instance,

257
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,302
a camera this small

258
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,204
can take a picture...

259
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,538
this big.

260
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,635
Amazing, isn't it?

261
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,543
Don't you think
the clarity is wonderful?

262
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,607
I'm sure you people at the back can see
all the roses on our suspect's scarf.

263
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:10,213
No longer do we have to rely
on crude convenient store video.

264
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,416
With digital capability,

265
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,518
we can dispose
of 20 closed-circuit systems

266
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:19,998
and achieve optimum
picture quality.

267
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:23,399
Now I'm sure the person...
there didn't realize

268
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,733
that they were being
caught in the act.

269
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,432
Wouldn't you agree?

270
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,600
Remember, none of us

271
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,269
are in divorce law for love.

272
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,250
I think you like him.

273
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,949
Like him?
Are you crazy?

274
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,514
Sure, but I'm also
your mother...

275
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,049
when we're
not in public.

276
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,528
I know, it's a little painful,

277
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,054
but I can see results already.

278
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,761
I have the lower lids
of a teenager. Oh!

279
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,294
Okay, one that's been thrown through the
windshield, but a teenager nevertheless.

280
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,307
I didn't sleep a wink
because of that guy.

281
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,310
Don't worry, I'm going to catch him
with his guard down,

282
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,471
and then kick him
in the body part of my choosing.

283
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,641
Just be careful,
you've never lost a big case.

284
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,707
Well, neither has he.

285
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,378
And that's just irresistible.

286
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,614
- Mother!
- I'm sorry.

287
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,351
That's it.

288
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,983
I'll apologize.

289
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,961
To Rafferty? Why?
You haven't done anything wrong.

290
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,624
Exactly. So it'll be
the last thing he's expecting.

291
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,826
It's the perfect strategy.

292
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,199
A sincere apology
is just a manipulating tactic,

293
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,205
like... like forgiveness,
or generosity.

294
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,434
He'll fall for it.
He's not from New York.

295
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,706
You are so adorable
when you're going for the kill.

296
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,270
Hi.

297
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,111
I came to apologize.

298
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,777
Oh... you're
bothering to knock.

299
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,786
Don't you usually just
break and enter?

300
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,812
Hysterical. And I didn't
break and enter.

301
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,484
If you review
your surveillance tape...

302
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,516
you know, just how paranoid
are you by the way?

303
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,188
You'll notice
that your office was open

304
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,220
and my intention
was to have a meeting.

305
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,631
My apology
is for any confusion.

306
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,295
Oh.

307
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,500
I don't know what to say.

308
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,530
"Come in" would be nice.

309
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,668
Come in.

310
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,371
Actually, you're lucky I don't sue you
for injuries sustained

311
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,577
when I picked up
those file boxes.

312
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,678
I cite "Gibbon v. Masters... treacherous
conditions in the workplace."

313
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,814
You, uh, sustained an injury?

314
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,757
I broke a nail.
Open your present.

315
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,424
Oh, look at that.
Very nice.

316
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,026
I thought you'd enjoy
owning one without a stain.

317
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,435
Interesting presumption.

318
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,530
You gave a very good speech
yesterday, by the way.

319
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,404
Very provocative.

320
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,741
The, uh, "butter wouldn't melt"
guide to divorce.

321
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,110
I take the high road.
I use the law,

322
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,739
not cheap theatrics.

323
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,478
Okay.

324
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,418
Meeting's a good idea.

325
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,548
So let's get on with it.

326
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,718
Excuse me?

327
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,558
Let's meet over dinner.
And since you initiated it,

328
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,394
protocol dictates that you should
take me, don't you think?

329
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,525
Yes, of course.

330
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,298
Or... we could eat here.
I have Snickers.

331
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,900
Hello, Leslie,
would you book my table

332
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,841
- at the Four Seasons, please?
- No, no, no, no, no.

333
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,777
My choice. Bye, Leslie.

334
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,406
All right,
as long as it isn't outside.

335
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,245
There's a 65%
chance of rain tonight.

336
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,718
There's a low-pressure system
coming out of the Northwest.

337
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,914
I watch the Weather Channel.

338
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,356
Could you be more fascinating?

339
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,917
De Colombia
o de Brasil

340
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,122
¿ Cuאl cafי
se va a servir?

341
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,462
Rico frio
y culto es Ud.

342
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,094
¿ Quי expresito
quiere beber?

343
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,331
Ah, dos huevos de chivo,
por favor.

344
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,703
¿Huevos de chivo?
With the huevo?

345
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,731
Oh, si.

346
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,836
God, I love this place.

347
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,075
It's so romantic, no?

348
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,980
- No.
- Oh.

349
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,542
So what was
all this high-morality,

350
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,884
passion-within-a-marriage
crap you were spouting?

351
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,049
Well, don't you ever
just want to slap your clients,

352
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,558
tell them to go home
and sort it out?

353
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,685
Actually, no, I don't.

354
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,320
Each case I handle
convinces me further

355
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,228
that marriage
is dead in the water.

356
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,199
I see.

357
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,666
- I see?
- Yep.

358
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,637
- That's it? You see?
- Yes, I do.

359
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,504
I see a lot.
Are you dating anyone?

360
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,805
You see a lot...
am I dating anyone?

361
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,403
- What kind of a segue is that?
- I don't think you are.

362
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,710
Ohh, this is what you see.

363
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,716
You see that I couldn't
be dating anyone?

364
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,514
I could be dating, mister.
Trust me, okay?

365
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,248
I could be dating
a whole big deal.

366
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,188
I could be lobbying
for a 12-day week,

367
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,783
I'm dating so much, okay?
Oh, what is this?

368
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,987
What is this, "arms in the air,
I rest my case" thing?

369
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,428
- What is that?
- You're not dating. Why not?

370
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,728
- Okay, since you ask...
- You're beautiful...

371
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,666
- what is dating anyway?
- Intelligent.

372
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,669
- It's trial marriage.
- I'm eating with the most beautiful...

373
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,796
What? Trial marriage? I thought you just
said marriage was dead in the water.

374
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,670
And that's why I don't date.

375
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,039
Subject closed.

376
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,312
- How about you?
- How about me, what?

377
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,344
You dating anyone?

378
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,051
I thought you just closed that subject.

379
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,525
- I just reopened it.
- I see.

380
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,188
You mean,
apart from tonight?

381
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,198
This isn't a date.

382
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,564
- This is a meeting.
- Seriously?

383
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,502
Yes, seriously. My first response
is always the truth.

384
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,028
It's a rule I live by,
personally and professionally.

385
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,303
A person's first response
is what they truly feel.

386
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,936
Oh, that's very good, very profound.
I mean, I couldn't agree more.

387
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,845
But can't we reach a compromise,
call it an intimate meeting?

388
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,678
Intimacy doesn't change a thing.

389
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,581
Business is business.

390
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:42,382
Oh, come on,
you don't mean that.

391
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,649
Oh, boy.

392
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,553
Don't you try to analyze me

393
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,388
with your disheveled, bohemian,
"my socks don't match,

394
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,362
therefore I have insight to all things"
whacko mindset.

395
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:55,526
There are no psychoanalytical
shortcuts into my pants, okay?

396
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,296
Dos huevos de chivos.

397
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,102
Gracias.

398
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,038
Mmm.

399
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:05,133
Oh, look, medical
waste in a glass.

400
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,803
- No umbrella?
- Okay, you're gonna have to drink this.

401
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,145
This is an old
Cuban tradition I learned.

402
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,845
Before the duel,
the two opponents drink

403
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,182
the huevo de chivo together.

404
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,213
It means "just because
I'm trying to kill you,

405
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,657
doesn't mean I don't
love and respect you."

406
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,889
Huevo de chivo.

407
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,064
Ohh! Ahh!

408
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,769
What the hell was that?

409
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,278
Huevo de chivo.
Goat's nut.

410
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,039
Goat's nut?

411
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,777
I just had a goat's nut
in my mouth?

412
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,216
No, it's a cherry.
It's a cherry.

413
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,879
Look, it's a maraschino cherry.

414
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,115
Mmm, there you go.

415
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,351
Too strong for you?

416
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,689
Not at all.

417
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,490
- Let's have another.
- No.

418
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,554
No, this is lethal stuff.

419
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,395
- Really?
- Yeah.

420
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,128
- Waitress?!
- Oh, no.

421
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,933
- Huevo de chivo.
- Huevo de chivo.

422
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,940
- Mmm.
- Hah!

423
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,273
Uh-oh.

424
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:18,146
Did you bring an umbrella,
Mrs. Weather Channel?

425
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,914
65%?

426
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,080
I mean, if you'd said 85 or 90...

427
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,717
Yeah, and it's precisely
that 25% extra

428
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,021
that you need and I don't.

429
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,857
And there's a difference
between how you and I

430
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,363
need different percentages.

431
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:36,265
Because if my style
is 6-5 and you're 8-5...

432
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,236
Whooo!

433
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,296
- I'm a little drunk.
- Yeah.

434
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,034
Well, at least
we'll be equally hung over

435
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,508
when we see Judge Abramovitz
in the morning.

436
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,002
Yeah, you and her,
what's up with that?

437
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,016
Oh, my mouth has gone numb.
I can't feel anything.

438
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,678
Can you?

439
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,224
I felt that okay.

440
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,161
Hey. Hey, you're
not supposed... yeah.

441
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,686
You?

442
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:30,746
Oh!

443
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,430
Oh my God.

444
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,966
What have I done?

445
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,639
Cup of coffee?
Due in court, 45 minutes.

446
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,911
- Clothes are in the dryer.
- The dryer?

447
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,127
I wore panties.
That much I remember.

448
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,767
Did I do anything last night
I might regret?

449
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,863
I hope not.

450
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,898
Ohh.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

451
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:28,435
At least we'll both arrive
in court looking like hell.

452
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,141
Ready?

453
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,479
- Oh, come on!
- What's wrong?

454
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,212
I mean, you always say
I look like crap.

455
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,243
Don't you like it?
Tie looks good.

456
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,755
$97 million, Your Honor.

457
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,817
And yet he is trying
to hold my client

458
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,297
to a penurious prenuptial
which we have shown is clearly suspect.

459
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,799
Mary Harrison is entitled
to at least half of his assets

460
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,393
and a continuing percentage
of profit in his corporation.

461
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,563
- You don't really mean that.
- What?

462
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,436
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Ms. Woods,

463
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,805
but are you suggesting
that because the number is so large,

464
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,437
your client is entitled to more than
was agreed upon in the prenup?

465
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,470
Because that was not
your position last night,

466
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,710
assuming you remember
last night's...

467
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,411
position.

468
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:11,149
I am speaking...
this morning

469
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,918
of two people who are
husband and wife...

470
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,425
two people who shared
eight years together...

471
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,088
A wife who in their most
intimate moments

472
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,290
inspired her husband's
greatest creations.

473
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,855
Oh, what did you say?
It was brilliant.

474
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,697
I wrote it down somewhere.
Um... there you go.

475
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,997
Here.

476
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,665
Um..."intimacy
doesn't change a thing.

477
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,198
Business is business."

478
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,700
- How dare you!
- Okay! Okay! This is how I see it.

479
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,805
According to
the state of New York,

480
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,475
Mrs. Harrison signed
a prenuptial agreement

481
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,814
that no one has proven
to me is flawed in any way.

482
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,376
So the court finds
the document holds

483
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,615
and assets shall be divided
according to its provisions.

484
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,385
Case dismissed.

485
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,086
And whatever the two of you
got going on, take it outside.

486
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:54,158
You know, I've come to think we have a
great success on our hands here and uh...

487
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,429
One moment, please.

488
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,766
Audrey! Audrey, wait!

489
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,931
Audrey. Audrey, wait!
Wait just one moment.

490
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,565
Come on. Come on,
let me explain.

491
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,576
Please, just let me
explain, all right?

492
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,545
Counselor, you are now operating
in a morality-free void

493
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,310
- in which all bets are off.
- You don't get it, do you?

494
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,976
I just paid you
the ultimate compliment.

495
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:13,847
Compliment?

496
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,716
You forced me to fight
dirtier in there

497
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,154
than I've ever had to do before.
That's how good you are.

498
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:21,488
Oh, please, save the L.A.
Schmooze for Judge Judy.

499
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,323
You owe me an apology.

500
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,989
Like the apology
you gave me last night?

501
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,056
Okay, I was trying
to soften you up.

502
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,035
And then I let you seduce me
so you'd think you had the upper hand.

503
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,231
You let me seduce you?
You let me?

504
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,603
Are you wounded, Mr. Rafferty?

505
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,437
Hey, hey, hey,
last night was very special.

506
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,340
There's no need to trash it
just because I beat you.

507
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,641
Hey, you know, you need
to toughen up a little bit.

508
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,704
If I got bruised
by every lawyer I bagged

509
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,308
I'd living in a padded cell
in Bellevue by now.

510
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,054
You finished with these?

511
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,893
Bagged? You actually used
the word "bagged"?

512
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,626
Right on the courthouse steps
in the 21st century.

513
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,930
Wow. And how many
have you bagged?

514
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,835
- None. That's not the point, Mother.
- Shh-shh!

515
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,639
Audrey, look at me.

516
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,643
I don't know why you have
developed this inability

517
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,406
to admit when you're
attracted to someone.

518
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,242
It's not healthy
and you know it.

519
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,146
And one day, I promise you
you will wake up

520
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,810
with a wedding ring
on your finger

521
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,376
and you will be the happiest person
in the world to be married.

522
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,047
I am not attracted to him.

523
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,955
I just hate that dealing with him
had to get so low down.

524
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,618
You decided
to practice divorce law.

525
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,992
At what point did you think
it was going to get really classy?

526
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,759
The new Serenas.

527
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,459
Who?

528
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,526
Serena, the hottest
new designer out there.

529
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,561
- Never heard of her.
- Of course you have.

530
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,096
- She's married to Thorne Jamison.
- Who?

531
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,336
He's the lead singer
of the Needles.

532
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:48,607
Honey, he just signed
a huge recording contract...

533
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,843
80 zillion or something.
Oh, Serena.

534
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,250
She understands the last thing to go
on a woman are her shoulders.

535
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,618
She's bound to win
the Nobel Prize.

536
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,623
At least.

537
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,594
Focus, Audrey, focus!

538
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,229
Well, actually Mr. Harrison
said I inspired him

539
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,537
to come up with one of
his new inventions. Uh...

540
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,440
what's it called?
"The paperpusher."

541
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,308
Huh, did you get
a cut of that?

542
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,712
Uh, no.
No, not at all.

543
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:27,309
Uh, just winning
Gary's case was enough.

544
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,719
Yes, and your courtroom tussles
with counselor Audrey Woods

545
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,986
are becoming, uh, quite the talk
of the town in legal circles.

546
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,327
Well, well, well,
what can I say?

547
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,627
I mean,
Audrey Woods is uh...

548
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,428
Well, she's the finest
attorney I've ever met.

549
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,456
Hmm.

550
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,991
I can only aspire
to be as clever as her.

551
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,025
Right.

552
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,470
She's uh...
she's wonderful.

553
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,736
- Really wonderful.
- Huh?

554
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,266
And you've just published
this book on divorce,

555
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,144
"For Better or Worse:
A Guide to a Happy Divorce."

556
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,976
That's right.

557
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,880
- Book? Book? What book?!
- It's got excellent reviews.

558
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,350
When does he write books?!

559
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,250
Outside of New York's
biggest divorce trial

560
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,118
since Gary Harrison's last April,

561
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,554
the case of basketball legend

562
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,252
Adamo Shandela
and his wife Irene...

563
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,023
the trial which has two of the city's
top divorce pit bulls

564
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,121
Audrey Woods
and Daniel Rafferty

565
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,461
against each other once again.

566
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,194
Now the verdict
has just been handed down.

567
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,225
Wait a minute, I'm told
he's on his way out.

568
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,466
Adamo, how does it feel
to have the verdict go your way?

569
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,633
Well, I just feel lucky
to have the best lawyer

570
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,506
in New York on my side,
you know what I'm saying?

571
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,774
Ms. Woods, in a case that's had
to reveal so much indelicate information

572
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,246
about the petitioner's
private life,

573
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,010
you've really been commended
on your aboveboard tactics.

574
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,677
It's all about
doing your homework,

575
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,583
researching
every aspect of the law,

576
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,521
burning the midnight oil...
you have to be prepared for anything.

577
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,023
You know, if it's one thing
that I've learned,

578
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:43,084
it's don't get caught in court
with your pants down.

579
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,265
Ah, that's good.

580
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,700
Objection, Your Honor. Counsel is,
as usual, making assumptions.

581
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,794
Overruled, Ms. Woods!

582
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,930
Opposing counsel is

583
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,634
clearly kidding herself
if she believes...

584
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:57,902
Irrelevant, Mr. Rafferty.

585
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,069
Full documentation here,
Your Honor.

586
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,203
Everything you need to know.

587
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,906
Videotapes are irrelevant,
Mr. Rafferty.

588
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:03,709
No room for argument.

589
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,340
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel is badgering.

590
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,214
Motion denied again,
Ms. Woods.

591
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,582
Get off the desk,
Mr. Rafferty.

592
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,644
Ms. Woods,
this court has absolutely

593
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:14,385
no interest in your opinion
of Mr. Rafferty's choice of socks.

594
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,758
Ms. Woods' capacity for alcohol
has no relevance to these proceedings.

595
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,524
- Bailiff!
- No, clearly you did not,

596
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,896
- Counselors! Counselors!
- Because... no, no...

597
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,401
If I want to sit through personal
attacks, yelling, screaming

598
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,528
foul language, bickering,
I'll spend the afternoon

599
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,596
with my family
in Scarsdale, understand?

600
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,129
Yes, Your Honor.

601
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,470
It may be cool though,
especially from Boston

602
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,843
northward here,
across parts of Maine...

603
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,839
and throughout portions of New England.
Only 52 in Burlington, 51 in...

604
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:43,445
It's Audrey. I'm not here
right now, so leave a message.

605
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,752
Even if I was here,
I wouldn't take calls from you.

606
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,020
We both know that's not true.

607
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,220
Listen,
I'm sorry to bother you,

608
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,956
but it's really overcast
downtown here

609
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,861
and I thought you just might
have an inside track

610
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,160
from the Weather Channel,
you know,

611
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,429
and what time it's gonna
start raining.

612
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,229
Okay.

613
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,241
Look, if you want me
to leave you alone, I will.

614
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,073
But for the record
I think it's a great shame.

615
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:10,877
So... take care.

616
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,780
- Hello?
- Oh, you are there.

617
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,615
Yeah, I just picked up the phone
to tell you to leave me alone.

618
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,484
I just said I was going
to leave you alone.

619
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,615
I know, I'm just telling you
that I want you to.

620
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,249
You don't mean that.

621
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,954
- Trust me.
- On the first bit or the second bit?

622
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,553
- Both.
- I'm confused.

623
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,894
- What about?
- I'm not sure.

624
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,593
Perhaps you could
send me a tape of this.

625
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,532
Don't be ridiculous.

626
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,036
- Have dinner with me.
- I'm not hungry.

627
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,767
- I didn't mean right now.
- Well, neither did I.

628
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,331
Honey!

629
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,467
I have to go.

630
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,542
So this is how you're
spending Saturday night,

631
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,848
eating junk food and watching
the Weather Channel?

632
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,548
I have tickets to Thorne Jamison
and the Needles.

633
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,319
- Let's go.
- To a rock concert?

634
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,452
Sex, drugs and rock and roll
is your thing, Mom, not mine.

635
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:01,693
Get ready
to roll back the dice

636
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:08,301
Freddy's burning up
in Satan's Fahrenheit

637
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,706
Crash landing
from a snowball parasite

638
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:19,046
Television is the Devil's
chosen fun

639
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,814
- Ohhh
- Singing at the moon

640
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:26,517
Seaside pleasure
and all that shagging around

641
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:30,687
Fall into your head,
she said what she said

642
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:34,459
Get ready
to roll back the dice

643
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:38,026
Fall out of your bed,
we'll wake up the dead

644
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,527
Get ready
to roll back the dice.

645
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:45,702
Oh my God, I think I'm deaf.

646
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,842
Hey, are you all right?

647
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,811
Do you want
to tell me about it?

648
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:01,018
He's an asshole.

649
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,958
I hate him.

650
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,895
He screws everything.

651
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,398
If I don't divorce him,
I'm gonna kill him!

652
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,127
Ugh!

653
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,160
Listen, can I give you
some advice?

654
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,001
You're very young.

655
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,666
Relationships take work,

656
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,198
and... and lots of couples
go through rough patches.

657
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,734
And there's always a way
to get through them.

658
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,906
You know, divorce
should be a last resort.

659
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,746
This is something
I know a little bit about.

660
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,150
You're wearing
my blouse wrong.

661
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,747
It should be worn
off the shoulder.

662
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,814
You have nice shoulders.

663
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,190
Are you Serena?

664
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,696
- So your husband is...
- The fathead on stage? Yeah.

665
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,398
Let me give you my card.

666
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,909
I just want you to know,
Mrs. Jamison,

667
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,417
That if you should choose
Katz, Cohen & Phelps,

668
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,476
I take care of my clients.

669
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,489
We are considered the Tiffany's
of New York law firms.

670
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,959
Yeah, well, I wish
it was Home Depot

671
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,427
so you could rip his heart out
with a chainsaw.

672
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:16,395
Well, there's that approach too.

673
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,597
Here's to Audrey
and her new client Serena,

674
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,231
and all the money she's going
to bring in to the company.

675
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,969
- No, it's not definite yet.
- It's not definite yet.

676
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,499
The gentleman asked me
to send you this.

677
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,203
Thank you.

678
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,184
What in God's name is that?

679
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:40,554
- You've never had a goat's nut?
- I can't say that I have.

680
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,350
Hey, man, what's going on?

681
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,434
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

682
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,236
Do you think that's really
a goat's nut in there?

683
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,405
Oh, Ms. Woods,
look at that.

684
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,383
Uh, I see you're
celebrating over there.

685
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,510
Would you like to join us?

686
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,281
Ah, I just wanted to say
hello to Serena.

687
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,051
Well, you're a fan.
Well, who isn't?

688
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,787
Uh, Serena, Audrey Woods.
Serena's my new client.

689
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,990
- Sadly, she's getting a divorce.
- Yes, I know.

690
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,931
Oh, you do?

691
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,900
Oh well, I guess
these things hit the papers.

692
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,630
No, I know, because
up until 30 seconds ago

693
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,901
I thought she was going
to hire me to represent her.

694
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,702
- What?
- That's a good look, counselor.

695
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,641
Did you practice that
in the mirror?

696
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,202
Hey, I decided
to use someone else.

697
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,373
Thing is, in the meetin'
you were all up in that

698
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,646
"high road, let's keep it clean,
no need to get ugly" stuff.

699
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,210
Then I read his book.

700
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,415
Danny's what I want.

701
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,425
He'll cut Thorne's balls off
and give 'em back as earrings.

702
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,451
But in all fairness, uh,
Serena, it should be noted

703
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,089
that Ms. Woods is very capable
of cutting men's balls off.

704
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,996
All right.

705
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,263
Sorry, that came out
all wrong.

706
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:01,203
Um, just so you know,
the jacket wasn't designed

707
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,830
to be worn with a belt.

708
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,868
Okay.

709
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,630
I'll be right back.

710
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,667
You stole Serena
to spite me.

711
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,074
Come on in.

712
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,339
Cubicle 2 is free,
I believe.

713
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,107
I didn't steal anything.

714
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,807
She read my book
and came to me, I mean it.

715
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,645
I don't think
you mean anything you say.

716
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,709
Well, that, I'm afraid, is gonna
have to remain your problem.

717
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,914
But... I don't lie.

718
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,788
I don't approve of it.
When have I ever lied to you?

719
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:57,658
Well, let me tell you
something, buddy,

720
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,560
If you are taking
this case to mess with me,

721
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,758
things are gonna get really ugly.

722
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,528
Uglier than this?

723
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,058
And let me tell you
something, if I may...

724
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,799
if you were able to turn down
your self-serving paranoia

725
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,569
to a gentle simmer for a brief moment,
you might just discover

726
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,043
that you and I could actually
co-exist quite successfully.

727
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,740
And I don't mean
only professionally.

728
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,210
Don't forget
to wash your hands.

729
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:28,054
What, are you...
going for a world record?

730
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,918
Hello, girls.

731
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,592
- All right, form in a queue.
- Take this, take this.

732
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,600
I'm sure I can fit you all in.

733
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,397
What's your name,
my little girl?

734
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,700
- Cindy. Hey, sign it.
- Yeah? I had a dog called that once.

735
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,569
And how long have
you been a "Thornehead"?

736
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,436
Forever.

737
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,908
- I love you, Thorne!
- Yeah, I love you too, babe.

738
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,406
See this, Barry.

739
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,214
I've got classy fans too.

740
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,252
And uh...
what might you want?

741
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,122
I want you.

742
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,889
Ooh, chihuahua!

743
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,556
Nice opening line.
I like it.

744
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,623
Direct, no BS...
just how I like it.

745
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,635
Mmm.

746
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,638
Okay, tell me what
we're working with, doll face.

747
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:18,768
Okay, this is what
we're working with, doll face.

748
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,800
You've got a devoted,
hardworking wife at home,

749
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:24,645
and yet you cheat, lie, and blow all
your money on strippers and whores.

750
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,810
You finally abandoned her, leaving her
no option but to file for divorce.

751
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,945
That's the opposing
counsel's opening line.

752
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,649
Direct, no BS...
just the way you like it.

753
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,749
And your wife has just hired
the second best

754
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,090
divorce attorney
in New York city to deliver it.

755
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,118
Now you need someone to tell

756
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,529
your side of the story,
no matter how sordid,

757
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:45,160
and make you seem like
strawberry shortcake.

758
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,835
I like strawberry shortcake,

759
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,139
and I like your style.

760
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,202
Do you know
what I think?

761
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,737
I think we should continue
this conversation...

762
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,373
back at my place.

763
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,077
- You know what I think?
- What?

764
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,484
I think you should leave
the thinking to me.

765
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,219
Right.

766
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,989
Pain? I'll cause her so much pain
she'll wish she never...

767
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,121
Before I came along, the only
business decision he ever made

768
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,063
was whether to pay a hooker
with cash or credit.

769
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,158
...the purpose of a settlement
hearing is to avoid...

770
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,795
You should advise your client
that documentable threats of violence...

771
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,634
- makes my job so much easier.
- Threats, my ass!

772
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,640
Can we skip to the part
where you cut his balls off?!

773
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,369
If we could convince
Ms. Woods to go

774
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,347
through the motions
of discussing assets.

775
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,350
Assets?
She doesn't have any.

776
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,353
I'm the one who spits up all the money
for those dish rags she sells.

777
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,947
Dish rags?
Tell that to Nicole Kidman.

778
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,514
She wore my dishrags
to the Oscars, okay?!

779
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,719
Nyah, nyah, nyah...

780
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,320
I'm sure that Mr. Rafferty will agree
that we'll not get anywhere

781
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,193
without a degree
of consideration from all parties.

782
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,597
Consideration from him?
I'm his Goddamn wife.

783
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,999
And he didn't even have the courtesy
to tell me that he got

784
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,699
a skull and cross bones
pierced through the tip of his...

785
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,297
- I have enough.
- I'm good.

786
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,365
Mmm.

787
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,674
Look, forget it, okay?
I'm not interested in his money.

788
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,409
I make a good living.
There's only one thing I want.

789
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,748
- Uh-huh, and what is that?
- Caisleאn and Clocha.

790
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,254
Oh, yes, I remember seeing
that somewhere. What is it?

791
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,483
It's the most
magical place on earth.

792
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,618
- Mmm.
- It's our castle in Ireland.

793
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,185
It's my fairytale castle.

794
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,767
It's summer now,
the kids are back inside

795
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,429
Gotta ticket for a...

796
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:30,497
Ha-ha. And in here,
this is the... stay.

797
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,874
- This is where we like to rehearse...
- Stay. Ha-ha.

798
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,173
Jam with the boys in the band.

799
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,442
This is where I like to play
with my fruit machines.

800
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,006
Feeling lucky.
Feeling lucky!

801
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,087
Ahh.

802
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,921
Uh, gold, gold,
gold, gold, silver.

803
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,756
Who's is that?
That's not mine. Billy!

804
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,890
I hadn't become
my true self at that point.

805
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:58,595
I was still a bit... stupid.

806
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,400
And it's got
like 100 bedrooms.

807
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,338
I don't know,
maybe even less.

808
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,899
Serena uses one
for her hobbies and shit...

809
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,309
she likes to sew stuff.
Oh, here she is.

810
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:10,245
I love him, I love him,
I love him!

811
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,510
- Isn't she great?
- He's all mine!

812
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:13,538
He's all mine!

813
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,109
She may have been
on drugs at that point.

814
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,883
- Nah, just you, baby.
- You might be able to use that.

815
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,390
Oh, and come
and see my wheels.

816
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,725
Billy!

817
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,287
Okay, that was good.

818
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,394
So this is what you want?

819
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:32,925
Kezzlin and Kloik.

820
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,406
Clocha.
Caisleאn Clocha.

821
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,101
Right. So this is
what you want?

822
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:41,509
Yeah. It means
"castle of rock."

823
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,012
I mean, how many more...

824
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:47,245
appropriate can you get,
you know?

825
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,218
Uh, when I found that out,
I had to have it, right?

826
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:51,050
And it was
your decision to buy,

827
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:54,182
uh, Cais... Caisl... Le Cle...
the castle... the rock castle?

828
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,748
Hell yes.

829
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,023
All right.

830
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:01,520
I told Thorne
"we have to live here."

831
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:03,499
So it was your decision
to buy it?

832
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,695
I called the realtor right away, yeah.

833
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,830
Hello?

834
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,807
Oh, hello, counselor.

835
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:17,174
Yes, I may have
good news too.

836
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:22,117
Well, it looks as though this thing
might end amicably after all.

837
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,120
Yes.

838
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:27,612
We're in serious danger
of peace breaking out.

839
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,554
Which will make me
very happy indeed.

840
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,898
Me too.

841
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,896
- Anyway, I have spoken to my client.
- So have I.

842
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,632
- She only wants the...
- He only wants...

843
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,539
- She only wants the...
- He only wants the...

844
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,905
Go to Ireland, depose
the staff at the castle,

845
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,384
- and we'll sort this out.
- Yes, Your Honor.

846
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,267
Oh, I see.
You're after hiring a car.

847
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,645
That's why I'm here,
Mr. O'Callaghan.

848
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,048
Oh, well, you've come
to the right place.

849
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:29,518
Good.

850
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,578
Only see, thing is,

851
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,681
we're not open
on a Tuesday.

852
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,419
Sorry?

853
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,155
Yeah, see, I'm not here
on a Tuesday.

854
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,698
I know, I know
what you're thinking.

855
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,258
If I'm not here
on a Tuesday

856
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,463
and we're not open
on a Tuesday

857
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:50,473
and today is Tuesday
and I'm standing here,

858
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,668
then how can it be?

859
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:56,611
Well now, it all depends
on how you look at it.

860
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,877
You see, normally...

861
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,084
See, if it's Tuesday,

862
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:09,559
and I'm not there
even though it's Tuesday,

863
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:12,118
come back sometime
when it's not Tuesday.

864
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,049
Hey!

865
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,492
Hey!

866
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,723
Excuse me!

867
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:49,231
Excuse me!

868
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,564
Thank you so much.
Could you please...

869
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,368
Where did you get
this Goddamn thing?

870
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:59,842
Top of the mornin' to you.
Caisleאn Clocha, is it?

871
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,208
Hop in.

872
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,207
In there? With you?

873
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,478
Oh, okay.

874
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,848
Well, it's really
not that far.

875
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,548
I mean, you just carry on
straight down this road here.

876
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:14,853
After about, oh, eight miles
you'll see a signpost

877
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,826
for the Devil's Staircase and uh...

878
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,021
well, apparently the castle
is just the other side.

879
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,367
So, where did you get it?

880
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,631
Uh, Mr. O'Callaghan
back in the village.

881
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,433
He's not open
on a Tuesday.

882
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,066
No, I borrowed this from Mr. O'Callaghan
the butcher down the road.

883
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,372
He's Mr. O'Callaghan,
the car hire man's, Uncle.

884
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,878
- And you see, every Tuesday...
- I don't want to know.

885
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,919
Oh, it's beautiful.

886
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,884
If you can touch the horizon

887
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,021
you're near your journey's end.

888
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,293
James Joyce?

889
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,028
No, my uncle Clive.

890
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,401
But equally profound,
wouldn't you say?

891
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,121
Well, that spoiled it for me.

892
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,619
What am I going to tell
Mr. O'Callaghan?

893
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,801
Isn't fog the most incredible
natural phenomenon?

894
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,966
See, in rocky areas like this,

895
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,306
the temperature of the rocks
in the daytime

896
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,973
is much cooler than the earth
so... what happens...

897
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,982
Weather Channel.

898
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,387
- It is now midnight.
- Look, look.

899
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,152
I know we're a bit lost,
I admit that,

900
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,320
but we're very close.
We're very close, I can smell it.

901
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,627
- See, I think if...
- Wait a second.

902
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,895
- What?
- Look, over here.

903
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:06,334
There's some old trailer.

904
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,670
Ohh.

905
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,610
Oh my God!

906
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,272
I think we've
landed on our feet.

907
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,475
See if you can get
some light going.

908
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,212
Oh yeah, then I'll run your bath
and get dinner on.

909
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,346
Hey, listen, we're in this together.
We're a team, okay?

910
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,584
Yeah, for now.

911
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,216
Whoo, it stinks!

912
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,817
There we go.

913
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,795
Well, all in all, I think
we've done quite well.

914
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:33,488
We?

915
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,794
Hey, listen, I got
the light going, didn't I?

916
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:38,926
Oh yeah, forgive me. I don't know
what I would have done without you.

917
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,494
Actually, I don't know
how you do it.

918
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,563
You write books,
you appear on TV,

919
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:46,872
you perform your
stand up routine in court.

920
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,575
Are you taking your clothes off?

921
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,206
Well, just... just...
just the bottoms.

922
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:54,342
I mean, you know,
they're covered in slime.

923
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,852
Ugh! Why did I do that?

924
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:00,323
And in your spare time,
you work for the Irish Tourist Board.

925
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,884
- And your point is?
- I was doing fine on my own.

926
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,656
Oh, come on,
let's be honest.

927
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,027
You were lost
until I came along.

928
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,226
Oh, slightly metaphorical.

929
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,568
Anyway, come on.

930
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,663
Lie down. You look tired.
You need to rest.

931
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:21,143
What, so you can get
to Caisleאn click before me?

932
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,237
It's not "click."

933
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,807
- It's clocha.
- Clocha.

934
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,183
- Caisleאn Clocha.
- Kluhh... kuhh.

935
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,620
Clocha... it's not even a word.
What kind of a word is that?

936
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:35,090
It's an Irish word.
We're in Ireland. Learn to adapt.

937
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,889
I can adapt. I'm very adaptable
as a matter of fact.

938
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,021
- I'm probably more adaptable than you.
- Oh.

939
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,587
- And a word of advice.
- Yes?

940
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,792
Never tell a woman
she looks tired.

941
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,632
Boy, you just summed yourself up
in one sentence.

942
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:50,197
All-consuming, competitive spirit
meets rampant insecurity.

943
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,538
Now why... why would
someone as accomplished

944
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:57,513
and as clever as you
be so insecure, hmm?

945
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,811
I'll tell you what,

946
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:03,047
you spend your teenage years
as the pimply, gangly daughter

947
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,849
of the most beautiful
woman in the world,

948
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,083
and get back to me.

949
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,890
You better not leave me.

950
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:26,742
Never.

951
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,420
Oh.

952
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,826
Oh my Lord.

953
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:57,366
- We were this close?
- Uh-huh.

954
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,865
The hell with Thorne and Serena.
I want it.

955
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:06,209
Well, duty calls.

956
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:08,046
Yep.

957
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,150
So you think you
can get the servants

958
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,955
to back up your claim?

959
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,257
Well, I guess we'll find out.

960
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,526
I guess we will.

961
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,628
Hello, there.
Welcome to Caisleאn Clocha.

962
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,160
- Hello, I'm Audrey Woods.
- I'm Daniel Rafferty.

963
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,570
- I'm representing Mr. Jamison.
- I'm representing Mrs. Jamison.

964
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,164
I'm wondering would it be possible
to speak to the staff for a moment,

965
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,039
- just a little bit?
...lnterview them for a while?

966
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:36,876
Ah, would you be the posh lawyers
over from America, then?

967
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:39,211
- Yes.
- That's grand.

968
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:08,208
- Well, they all agree with me so far.
- Me too.

969
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:17,176
Brendan, I'm going to need
to interview the staff again.

970
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,347
I'm not getting anywhere.

971
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,448
I'm afraid you'll be
out of luck there, sir, sure.

972
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,755
They'll all be down
at the festival.

973
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,818
It's the village's
anniversary.

974
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:29,992
It celebrates the couple who founded
the place nearly 200 years ago.

975
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:31,864
It's a lovely story.

976
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:35,268
They were deeply in love
but her father didn't approve,

977
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:38,502
so they ran away here
and got married in secret.

978
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:41,339
And every year we have
a festival in their honor.

979
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,073
It's very romantic.

980
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:46,241
- Singing and dancing.
- Aw, that's nice.

981
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,217
So basically,
the old fella didn't like

982
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,412
this Scottish knight
nailin' his daughter,

983
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,318
Et cetera, et cetera,
blah, blah, blah.

984
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:56,155
So it's basically, a lame excuse
for a three-day booze up.

985
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:06,357
So is it the wild woman
of the bogs herself?

986
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,963
I'd never've recognized ya.

987
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:10,973
Aye, you're cuttin'
a fine figure this evening,

988
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:14,101
Even if I do say so me-self.

989
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,736
And you look like you're...

990
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,303
You're wearing...

991
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:19,641
that.

992
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,276
- You don't like it?
- No, no, you got kind of a...

993
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,120
"Lenny Kravitz meets Kiss without
the makeup" thing going on.

994
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,887
Never too old
to rock and roll, huh?

995
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,422
You heard the story
of this place?

996
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,518
Yeah, it's all little elves
and leprechauns for me.

997
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,995
Oh. Well, I thought
it was rather charming.

998
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,292
There you go.

999
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,027
- Oh, what's this?
- Oh, it looks like poteen.

1000
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,830
- "Poo" what?
- It's not "poo."

1001
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,734
It's puh, puh...
"puh-cheen."

1002
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:17,365
It's a traditional irish drink,
slightly illegal.

1003
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,035
- It's like moonshine.
- Oh, so that's Gaelic for "goats nut."

1004
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,907
Cheers.

1005
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,143
Ah! I was right.
It is poo.

1006
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,481
Could I have the pleasure
of this dance with you, miss?

1007
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,646
- Oh, you know what, I can't...
- Oh, she'd love to.

1008
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,121
- And I'm working.
- Go on. Go on.

1009
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,646
- I'm working!
- You'll soon pick it up.

1010
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:35,953
I'm working here.

1011
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,584
No!

1012
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,060
Make sure to keep
those legs up.

1013
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:41,427
Whoo!

1014
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,732
Come on.
You, come on.

1015
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,938
No, no, you go.

1016
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,910
Are you dancing?

1017
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,082
No, I'm not.

1018
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,590
No, madam, I'm not.

1019
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,059
I'm slightly indisposed.
My ankle and stuff like this.

1020
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,686
- I'd love to, but...
- Oh, don't be so soft.

1021
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,356
- No!
- Get yourself up here.

1022
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,240
Bejesus, you're a wholesome
strap of a woman.

1023
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,706
Are you married?

1024
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,905
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

1025
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,315
Ho-ho!

1026
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,354
I can't leave you alone
for a second, can I?

1027
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:44,383
Come on, honey, let's go.
I'm serious this time.

1028
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,292
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

1029
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:49,058
Go!

1030
00:57:57,173 --> 00:58:00,165
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1031
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,410
Yeah!

1032
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,476
Yeah!

1033
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,790
Yeah!

1034
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,692
Oh, lovely.
Lovely.

1035
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,722
Fine.
Here you go.

1036
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,437
Thanks!
All right!

1037
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,606
Here you go, a drink
for the little guy.

1038
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:35,303
Cheers!

1039
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,279
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your places

1040
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,678
at the wedding circle.

1041
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,982
The vows you have taken
are holy and binding.

1042
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,487
You've exchanged rings

1043
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,582
as a token
of your eternal love.

1044
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:53,358
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1045
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,261
You may kiss the bride.

1046
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:58,165
Aww...

1047
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,691
That's beautiful.

1048
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,716
It's a lovely story.

1049
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,310
They were deeply in love,
so they ran away here

1050
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,287
and got married in secret.
It's very romantic.

1051
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:23,759
The vows you have taken
are holy and binding.

1052
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:26,125
You've exchanged rings

1053
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:29,256
as a token
of your eternal love.

1054
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:33,201
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1055
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,568
You may kiss the bride.

1056
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:53,819
Oh my God.

1057
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,620
Oh...

1058
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,388
my...

1059
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,328
God.

1060
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,161
God.

1061
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,938
Oh. Ahhhh!

1062
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:17,446
Okay, okay.
Wake up! Wake up!

1063
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,005
- Oh, morning.
- Wake up!

1064
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,449
Would you please look
at your left hand, please?

1065
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:24,316
- What. Oh.
- Please!

1066
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:29,281
Oh, would you look at that?

1067
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:32,192
Oh, you got one too.

1068
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,531
Daniel, did we
get married last night?

1069
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,500
Yes, I have a feeling we did.

1070
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:40,468
- The details are a little bit fuzzy,
- Oh, oh...

1071
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,767
but I think the bride
was scintillating...

1072
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,171
in her figure-hugging
Serena outfit and...

1073
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,073
you're not happy.

1074
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,271
Do I look happy?!

1075
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,247
Well, it's hard to say, I mean, because
you never seem to be happy around me

1076
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,714
and I always seem
to make you angry and...

1077
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,217
Oh, oh, oh,
it's all coming back.

1078
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,118
We got to find the guy that did this
and tell him we didn't mean it.

1079
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:02,090
- Well, what if I did mean it?
- Of course you didn't. How could you?

1080
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:05,424
You don't want
to be married to me!

1081
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:09,056
Mrs. Flanagan!
Mrs. Flanagan!

1082
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,430
Mrs. Flanagan!

1083
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,298
Oh, Mrs. Flanagan!

1084
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:16,328
- How do you know?
- Anybody up?!

1085
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:19,307
Ugh, I still don't get it.
How can a whole town

1086
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,470
be off on a Thursday
for no apparent reason?

1087
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:25,106
We're just gonna have to file
when we get back to New York, okay?

1088
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,582
- It'll be like it never happened.
- But it did happen.

1089
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:30,142
What happened is tied
to a much larger issue.

1090
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,177
Lot's of people get drunk
without tying the knot.

1091
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:35,452
I mean, when one's inhibitions are down,
one acts on one's true feelings.

1092
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:39,257
Sanderson v. Sanderson...
Supreme Court, Illinois, 1993.

1093
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:41,627
You're citing case laws
to support this insanity?

1094
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:44,758
We got married last night for goodness
sake. That means something.

1095
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:47,770
Yeah, it means that we drank too much
and made a mistake again.

1096
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,203
- Phooey!
- Hi.

1097
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,830
Hi. We just got married.

1098
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,670
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1099
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,609
- Stop telling people.
- She's the first one.

1100
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:57,010
Yeah, but this
kind of news spreads.

1101
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,673
I'll come back.

1102
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,683
Hmm.

1103
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,651
- Oh my God.
- What?

1104
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:04,880
We can't be married
and be opposing counselors.

1105
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,014
Why not?
Can I say something?

1106
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,785
We'll look ridiculous.
And no you cannot.

1107
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:09,484
Why not?

1108
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:11,493
We'll be the laughing stock
of the New York bar association

1109
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:13,654
because you will say something
contrary just to be contrary.

1110
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,857
- Only this is my marriage too.
- You see what I mean?

1111
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,866
Oh, my head is thumping.

1112
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,934
Ahh! Ugh!

1113
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,803
Will you look at that?

1114
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:29,334
You just broke the little
fella's leg right off.

1115
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:31,209
He's legless.

1116
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:34,879
I liked that.

1117
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:38,216
I was going to save that
as a souvenir.

1118
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,784
Hmm.

1119
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,588
I'm sorry, Daniel.

1120
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,065
I've known you for 35 years.

1121
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,935
Alcohol has a very bad effect on you.
You get hyper,

1122
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,675
you get aggressive,
you get married.

1123
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,307
No one at the office
can know,

1124
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,079
so I have to research
whatever legal system

1125
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,642
County Clare operates under.

1126
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:13,177
Well, why don't you just
file here if that's what you want?

1127
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:14,689
Oh, that's a great idea.

1128
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,885
It'll take the press
exactly two seconds to find out

1129
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:20,384
that I got drunk and married
and divorced in 24 hours.

1130
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:24,297
Given my vast experience
with divorce... and it is vast...

1131
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,028
my guess is that there's
a lot of wiggle room.

1132
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,559
Hell, you could probably get it annulled
as long as you didn't...

1133
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,266
never mind.

1134
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,139
I have to start wiggling
first thing in the morning.

1135
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,109
Mm-hmm.

1136
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,372
Mother, what is this?

1137
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,747
Oh, the girls and I
are having a lip party later.

1138
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,877
You can join us if you like.

1139
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,083
David takes fat out of our butts
and injects it into our lips.

1140
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:50,149
That gives a whole new meaning
to "talking outta your ass."

1141
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:58,731
Hello?

1142
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,395
Better pick up
the New York Post

1143
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:04,202
- before you file for divorce. Page 6.
- What?!

1144
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,812
Off to get one of these?

1145
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,614
Why did you tell them this?
Are you crazy?

1146
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,351
You think I did that?

1147
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:25,485
Why would I do that, when
you made it abundantly clear

1148
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,827
that being married was the last thing
you wanted to be, especially to me?

1149
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,732
- Can I?
- What are you doing?

1150
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:33,428
I'm calling The Post to tell them
they made a mistake.

1151
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,128
Daniel...

1152
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,263
Or that we made a mistake.
Which should I say?

1153
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,068
No, no, no,
put... put the...

1154
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,541
please, please, please,
put the phone down. L...

1155
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,441
I'm n...

1156
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:45,038
I'm not trying
to be hurtful here.

1157
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:47,379
Just bear with me
for a minute, okay?

1158
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,509
- Trust me.
- Mm-hmm.

1159
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,282
In the way
that you trust me?

1160
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,318
Okay, listen.

1161
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,121
We got married
whether we like it or not.

1162
01:04:57,159 --> 01:05:00,322
And it seems that it was,
if nothing else, a little impulsive.

1163
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:02,024
Personally, I blame
the "poo" drink.

1164
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:05,864
Now we're back in New York,
and on opposite sides of a major case,

1165
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,235
So whatever we may or may not do
in the future in the short term...

1166
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:10,796
- I agree.
- What?

1167
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,967
I agree. It's the only thing
we can do...

1168
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,169
in the short term.

1169
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,734
I haven't said
what I was going to say.

1170
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,803
You were going to say
that we have to appear married

1171
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,678
or we will seriously
screw up our careers.

1172
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:24,084
So... that only leaves
one question, doesn't it?

1173
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,115
Forgive me if I get emotional, but
this is the day every mother dreams of...

1174
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:31,956
the day she gets to watch
her only daughter

1175
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:35,088
put a lock on the bedroom door
to keep her husband out.

1176
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,564
Oh, stop it, Mother.

1177
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,658
It may have been a wedding,
but it is not a marriage.

1178
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:47,601
Hi, I'm the husband.

1179
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:49,770
Hi, I'm the mother.

1180
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:52,804
- Oh.
- Mmm?

1181
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:58,684
Uh, this is your room.

1182
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,086
I made some room
in the closet

1183
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,556
even though it looks like
you never hang anything up.

1184
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:03,615
Hmm.

1185
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,889
Bathroom's through there.

1186
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:08,158
Oh, she's back to her old self.
That seems promising.

1187
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:09,892
I told you darling,
we don't need separate bedrooms.

1188
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:12,264
I don't mind you snoring.
Can I use the kitchen?

1189
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,735
He cooks. You never
told me he cooks.

1190
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,840
Yes, well, it's been
a strange couple of days.

1191
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,467
I'm sure she'll come around,
don't worry.

1192
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:24,570
Shouldn't I be saying that to you?

1193
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:28,071
Yes, oh, I've enjoyed reading about you
in the society pages.

1194
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:30,483
Are you, uh, really 56?

1195
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,783
- Parts of me are.
- Ah.

1196
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,619
- Would you like a cocktail?
- Oh, yes, please.

1197
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,386
- Mmm.
- Only if it's an extremely large one.

1198
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:37,414
Okay.

1199
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,445
I made brownies.

1200
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:04,219
I've given up sugar.
It was a crutch.

1201
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:18,792
- What?
- Is that what you're wearing?

1202
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:21,029
- What's the matter with it?
- Nothing, nothing.

1203
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:25,063
It... it just needs...

1204
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,302
something.

1205
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:38,683
We're married, remember?

1206
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,189
We have to make it look
like we mean it...

1207
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,884
even if we don't.

1208
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,086
Let me.

1209
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:07,179
Well, say something.

1210
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,715
Uh...

1211
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,345
um...

1212
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,153
did you get
yourself one too?

1213
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,699
- You want me to do it or you?
- Uh... eh... I can do it.

1214
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:44,007
There, now we
can fool anyone, eh?

1215
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:47,451
I guess.

1216
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:52,727
All right, all right!
Quiet back there!

1217
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,196
I can't hear you!
I can't hear you!

1218
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:58,166
You pussy!

1219
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:06,475
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

1220
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:07,942
You're welcome.

1221
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,336
Just shut up. Why can't
you shut up and listen?

1222
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,281
Why can't you fall
under a snowplow?

1223
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,113
It's summer.

1224
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,985
Yeah, I'll buy you one
as a parting gift.

1225
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,222
...So I looked like 12.

1226
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,064
Oh, your mother
called earlier.

1227
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,568
Hey, I ran into
Tracey Abramovitz today.

1228
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,467
Oh, Tracey, Tracey.

1229
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,517
Four million?

1230
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:55,023
Aspen?

1231
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:57,048
Jeez.

1232
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:01,658
...it looks like it is going to cut

1233
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,722
its way through
the mid-Atlantic states.

1234
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:07,258
So later on in the day... New York and
also around, say, the Stanton area...

1235
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:09,635
you may see an isolated
shower or thunderstorm.

1236
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:15,206
...still soggy
across New England,

1237
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,906
otherwise high pressure settles
into the mid-Atlantic coast

1238
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,744
and it'll be dry
in the morning tomorrow.

1239
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:21,773
New York's shore forecast
for today, 75...

1240
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,494
Hmm.

1241
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:19,166
And not only did Serena
renovate and decorate...

1242
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:23,338
Yes, indeed,
save Caisleאn Clocha...

1243
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:26,439
she restored the gardens.
She reached out into the community,

1244
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:31,112
single-handedly reviving the ancient
textile industry in the area,

1245
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:33,781
pumping revenue
back into the economy.

1246
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:36,086
Yeah, she was pumping
the gardener as well.

1247
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,593
Shove it!

1248
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,118
Ms. Woods, if you don't
put a muzzle on him...

1249
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:43,393
Your honor, my client
is simply making the point

1250
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:46,731
that while he was away working
hard to pay for the castle,

1251
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,761
his wife's activities may not
have been entirely altruistic.

1252
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,774
If fidelity is at issue here, we can
happily produce receipts

1253
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,606
documenting Mr. Jamison's tour
of the world's brothels.

1254
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,238
Yeah!

1255
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,973
- Nice.
- All right, all right!

1256
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:04,645
- Quiet back there!
- Ahh!

1257
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,052
What is the relevance of this?

1258
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:07,919
I'm suggesting
that Mrs. Jamison

1259
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:10,584
doesn't deserve to be
awarded a $3 million castle

1260
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:13,561
simply because she hung some curtains
and was popular with the help.

1261
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,790
Why not? She shouldn't be
denied her standard of living,

1262
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,197
especially when her husband over there
forked out four million

1263
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,394
on a love shack
for his mistress in Aspen.

1264
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,142
How do you know that?

1265
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,175
I...

1266
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:37,013
I said don't
tell no one about Aspen!

1267
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:39,384
What about all that
lawyer-client crap?!

1268
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,049
I will not stand for this
behavior in the courtroom.

1269
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,490
You don't even know
how to ski!

1270
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,959
Just shut it.

1271
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,967
I want a divorce.

1272
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,395
It was an accident.

1273
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:21,953
I swear.

1274
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:23,931
I was taking out the garbage,
the bag broke...

1275
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,627
...and then in the middle
of the battle...

1276
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:26,827
I don't believe you.

1277
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:31,633
So...

1278
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:33,641
you want a divorce?

1279
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:35,108
Yes.

1280
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:37,442
So one little hiccup
and we give in, eh?

1281
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:39,037
Just like all the saps
we represent?

1282
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,981
Do not throw your take
on life and marriage at me

1283
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:43,314
like some moral battering ram.

1284
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:47,413
And what about the professional fallout
you seem so desperate to avoid?

1285
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,992
Well...

1286
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,962
I'm sorry,
I don't believe in divorce.

1287
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:56,988
You don't believe in divorce?
How can you say that?

1288
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:59,830
- You make your living...
- It's a job!

1289
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:03,197
But in those miserable couples,
what do we see?

1290
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,502
- What do we really see?
- Us. We see us!

1291
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,873
- People who have made a huge mistake...
- No, no, no, no!

1292
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,639
We see people
who are not willing to fight.

1293
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,270
You have to fight
for what you believe in.

1294
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:12,780
Fight fair, fight dirty,
but fight!

1295
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,339
People who are supposed
to fight to save a marriage

1296
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:16,044
have to be in a marriage
they want to be in!

1297
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:17,449
- I am!
- That's bullshit!

1298
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:19,181
No, it isn't!
Let me tell you something.

1299
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:20,848
I'm not in this marriage
to save my career,

1300
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:24,450
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I don't care about my career!

1301
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,093
But I do care about you...

1302
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,065
And so I will give you
a divorce, gladly,

1303
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:37,765
because...
call me old fashioned,

1304
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,535
but when you love someone...

1305
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,737
I believe you should be
unselfish enough

1306
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,803
to give them
whatever they want.

1307
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,843
I'll be around later
to pick up my things.

1308
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,505
Hello?

1309
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,239
Mom?

1310
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:08,987
- Hello?
- Hi, Sara, it's Arlene.

1311
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,727
Arlene, can I call you back?
I have Audrey with me.

1312
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:20,402
Darling, you can't
live your life

1313
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:22,307
trying to avoid
the mistakes I've made.

1314
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:24,403
You've got
to make your own.

1315
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,539
You think I'm making one?

1316
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,743
I don't know
what to tell you, honey.

1317
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,446
All I know is that I'm
running out of favors.

1318
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,647
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

1319
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:37,352
to place an item on page six
of the New York Post?

1320
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:43,631
Oh.

1321
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:45,929
It'll be all right.

1322
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,572
I had Thorne Jamison's

1323
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,771
12-year-old assistant
on the phone this morning.

1324
01:16:56,812 --> 01:17:00,043
Don't ask me how she got
my private line... it's unlisted.

1325
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:02,573
Anyway, she has informed me
that your client

1326
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,711
will not be appearing
in court today,

1327
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,187
as he has gone back
to his castle in Ireland.

1328
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:09,884
Which as you know has not yet
been awarded to either party

1329
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,620
and is, as such, off limits.

1330
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,322
Now I'm going to give you
48 hours to get him back here

1331
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:17,127
or I'm going to dismiss this case
for failure to prosecute.

1332
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,601
Are you okay?

1333
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,469
I'm fine.

1334
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:37,142
- Oh, welcome back.
- Hello, Mrs. Flanagan.

1335
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,914
Is Mr. Jamison in?

1336
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,945
- Oh my God!
- Oh, no.

1337
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,089
Oh my God!
Are you... oh!

1338
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,827
- Get off of me!
- Oh, I uh...

1339
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:53,926
I-I'm so sorry.
I thought y-you...

1340
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:55,732
you screamed.

1341
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,671
Yeah, don't you?

1342
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,571
Nice one, babe.

1343
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,132
Yeah, no... well...

1344
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:04,373
see, uh, we... we both
got here on separate planes

1345
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:08,543
and, uh, we were just about to get stuck
into tearing the place apart

1346
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:11,950
when Mrs. F comes in and says,
"Happy Anniversary."

1347
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,887
Seven years.

1348
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:16,152
You was just a baby,
weren't you?

1349
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:19,888
See, we got married here
in the local village.

1350
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,759
Anyway, we decided
to make it work.

1351
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:23,230
- You know, whatever, right?
- Yeah

1352
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:24,926
- You can't give up, right?
- No.

1353
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,900
I couldn't agree more.

1354
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,366
- Audrey.
- Hello.

1355
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,612
What are you both
doing here, anyway?

1356
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:43,107
I came to tell you you're not
legally allowed to be here.

1357
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,812
Yeah, but we are.

1358
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:46,878
Yeah, 'cause like we own it.

1359
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,482
But, uh, you know, thanks
for coming all this way.

1360
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:52,891
Michael! You must both
stay for some nosh.

1361
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,358
Yes, sir?

1362
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,628
Ah, hello there.
If it isn't themselves.

1363
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,895
How are you?

1364
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:03,302
Ah, Michael, uh,
will you tell Mrs. Flanagan

1365
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:05,829
that we will be
two extra for din-dins?

1366
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:09,241
- No problem, sir.
- So you work here as well?

1367
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:11,839
As well as what?

1368
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,370
Being a priest.

1369
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,350
Oh, I see!

1370
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,249
Yeah, the old festival.

1371
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:21,380
Ah, no, I just do that
for a bit of fun.

1372
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:24,415
I have an ecclesiastical
demeanor apparently.

1373
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:26,927
So...

1374
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,987
you're not a real priest?

1375
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:31,328
Oh, goodness me, no.

1376
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:35,063
Still, I see you went ahead
and did it for real.

1377
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:38,197
I can always tell
the ones who will.

1378
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,435
Congratulations.

1379
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,744
So...

1380
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,373
- so that means then...
- Oh, no! Oh, God.

1381
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:53,250
Well...

1382
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:58,056
the last thing anyone
in this room seems to need

1383
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:00,926
is a divorce attorney.

1384
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,960
I won't stay for supper,
if it's all the same to you.

1385
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:15,137
Excuse me.

1386
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,647
Well, ah...

1387
01:20:24,686 --> 01:20:26,085
Ah, thanks.

1388
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:28,419
Anyway, uh...

1389
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:30,117
both of you
have been great.

1390
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,149
I-I-I had no idea

1391
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,162
the legal system was so deep.

1392
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:35,322
Are you okay?

1393
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:38,127
No, I don't think so.

1394
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,532
Do you know what I think?

1395
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:43,436
I think you two have
had a lover's tiff.

1396
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:47,632
Yeah...
yeah, we did, kinda.

1397
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,610
Yeah, well,
you gotta get over it.

1398
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:52,670
You know, you were the one who said
you could get through the bad patches,

1399
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:54,682
that breaking up
was the last resort.

1400
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:57,344
Or something like that.

1401
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:00,679
Yes, I did.

1402
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:05,289
Will you give me a ride?

1403
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:13,129
- Do you know the way?
- Do I know the way?

1404
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:15,295
I know Ireland like
the back of my hand.

1405
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:16,031
Yeah, right.

1406
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:18,801
Along Giant's Pass,

1407
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,139
through Paddy's Cross,

1408
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,645
over the bridge,

1409
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:26,647
and back to Paddy's Cross.

1410
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:28,205
We're lost.

1411
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,514
No, no, no, no, I should have
turned right earlier.

1412
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,214
Ah, right, I'm all over it.
What time's your flight?

1413
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:43,292
Hi. Did the flight
for New York leave yet?

1414
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,258
Two minutes ago.

1415
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:48,462
Did Daniel Rafferty
check in?

1416
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:50,061
I'm sorry,
we're not allowed to give...

1417
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:51,732
Please, please,
can you just be the guy

1418
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:54,037
who breaks the rules,
just this once?

1419
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,370
It's really important.

1420
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:01,140
- Rafferty, you say?
- Yeah.

1421
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,016
Yes, he did. Were you meant
to be with him?

1422
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,719
Yes, I was.

1423
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:14,919
When's the next flight
to New York?

1424
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,441
Did you know
that 80% of women

1425
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:41,717
who say they're too busy to have
a relationship, are really lonely?

1426
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:47,556
And are you?

1427
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,598
I was.

1428
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,296
You're always saying
that you have to fight

1429
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:59,467
to save a marriage
and not give in, right?

1430
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:03,906
Yes.

1431
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,078
Do you really believe that?

1432
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,653
Yes, I do...

1433
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:15,622
very much.

1434
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:19,316
Why?

1435
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,261
Well...

1436
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:25,859
do you want to fight?

1437
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:30,002
Not only do I have to put up
with your bickering,

1438
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:32,802
finger pointing, backstabbing
and name calling during the week,

1439
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,308
now you drag me in
on the weekend too?!

1440
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:38,207
Anyway, seeing as we're here,

1441
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:42,478
Counselor Woods, I'd like
to ask you a question, if I may.

1442
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:46,384
Do you take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

1443
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:49,083
Will you love him, keep him,

1444
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,319
honor him and protect him,

1445
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:55,386
and forsaking all others,
be loyal only to him?

1446
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:01,531
- I will.
- I know what to say.

1447
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:05,336
I'm her mother.

1448
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:10,437
I will.

1449
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,309
So will I.

1450
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,747
Hey! Hey! I didn't
get to you yet.

1451
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,774
- Sorry.
- What is wrong with you people?

1452
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:19,787
Do you want to be the only man ever held
in contempt at his own wedding?

1453
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:21,311
No, Your Honor.

1454
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:25,722
Counselor Daniel Rafferty,

1455
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,558
do you take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

1456
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:30,257
Will you love her...

1457
01:24:30,298 --> 01:24:32,698
With the power invested in me
by the state of New York,

1458
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:36,761
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1459
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:39,000
You may kiss the bride.

1460
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,159
Bye.

1461
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,322
Here you go,
for old times' sake.

1462
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:05,127
Oh, wow.
How can I refuse?

1463
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:08,895
You know, you folks
may want to close the sunroof.

1464
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:12,600
There's a 79% chance of rain
in the next half hour.

1465
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:15,075
I watch
the Weather Channel.

1466
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:23,016
Then that time I went
and said goodbye

1467
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:27,488
Oh, now I'm back
and not ashamed to cry

1468
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:29,990
Ooh baby,
here I am

1469
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:32,993
Signed, sealed,
delivered, I'm yours

1470
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:35,552
Oh yeah,
sing it with me

1471
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:38,395
Here I am, baby

1472
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:42,028
- Signed, sealed, delivered
- You've got the future in your hand

1473
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:46,734
Oh yeah,
here I am, baby

1474
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:50,403
- Signed, sealed, delivered
- You've got the future in your hand

1475
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:54,506
Oh yeah, I've done
a lot of foolish things

1476
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:56,881
That I really didn't mean

1477
01:25:56,918 --> 01:26:00,046
Hey, baby

1478
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:02,613
Ohhh, ahhh

1479
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:06,218
I've seen a lot of things
in this old world

1480
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:10,459
But when I touch them
they did nothing, girl

1481
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,796
Ooh baby, here I am

1482
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:16,463
Signed, sealed,
delivered, I'm yours

1483
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:19,962
Ohhh, yeah, yeah

1484
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:23,500
Oo-wee, baby, you set
my soul on fire

1485
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:27,242
That's why I know
you're my one and only desire

1486
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:30,183
Ooh baby, here I am

1487
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:33,449
Signed, sealed,
delivered, I'm yours

1488
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:38,516
Oh yeah,
here I am baby, whoo

1489
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,255
Signed, sealed, delivered

1490
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,320
You've got the future
in your hands

1491
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:43,990
Oh, baby

1492
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,933
Here I am, baby

1493
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:48,492
Signed, sealed, delivered

1494
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,367
You've got the future
in your hands

1495
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,464
Oh, oh, yeah

1496
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:54,338
I've done a lot
of foolish things

1497
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,400
That I really didn't mean

1498
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:59,242
I could be a broken man

1499
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,975
But here I am

1500
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:04,007
Now here I am, baby, whoo

1501
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:07,647
- Signed, sealed, delivered
- Here I am, baby

1502
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:09,623
Ohh, yeah

1503
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:11,989
Here I am, baby

1504
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:15,655
Signed, sealed,
delivered, I'm yours.

1505
01:28:57,565 --> 01:29:01,160
Dead summer now,
the kids are back inside

1506
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:04,899
Get a ticket
for a sock and puppet ride

1507
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:11,367
Second nature
to a mother's only son

1508
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:15,075
Whoaa-ohh

1509
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:19,485
Freddy's burning up
in Satan's Fahrenheit

1510
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,354
Crash landing
from a snowball parasite

1511
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:30,126
Television
is the Devil's chosen fun

1512
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:32,462
Whoaa-ohh

1513
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,127
Now you're out of tune

1514
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:36,068
Whoaa-ohh

1515
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,594
Singing at the moon

1516
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:41,574
Seaside pleasure
and all that shagging around

1517
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:45,602
Fall into your head,
she said what she said

1518
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:50,549
Get ready
to roll back the dice.

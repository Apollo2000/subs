Ah, are you shitting me?

20
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,817
I told you I need more hours.

21
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,736
You only got me on the schedule
three days this week.

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,822
Joelle has five. What the hell, man?

23
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,990
Joelle smiles
when she comes in the door.

24
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,827
Yeah, bet that's not all she does.

25
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,662
Jeez.

26
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,404
Hello?

27
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,549
<i>Mrs. Gilbert,
pick up your daughter.</i>

28
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,033
<i>- She's suspended till Thursday.
- </i>What do you mean suspended?

29
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,119
<i>There was an incident in the bathroom.</i>

30
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,663
- Did she hurt anybody?
<i>- We'll explain when you come here.</i>

31
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,737
- You take your medicine?
- No.

32
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,178
I don't like that stuff.
It makes me sleepy.

33
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,264
It also keeps you
from lighting paper towels on fire

34
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,347
in the girls' bathroom.

35
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,017
What the hell were you thinking?

36
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,980
We're gonna talk about this later.

37
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,732
There are gonna be consequences.

38
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,611
Not bad.

39
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,049
<i>...player gets a top salary,</i>

40
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,301
<i>the next player negotiates
for even higher.</i>

41
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,904
<i>They have to go
one direction or another.</i>

42
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,346
<i>You can't be half-pregnant.</i>

43
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,682
<i>You've got a salary cap that you enforce,
or you can just go wild.</i>

44
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,768
<i>That's true. Well...</i>

45
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,066
- <i>Hey, Mom.</i>
- Hey, Shannan.

46
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,068
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Oh, glad I finally got you.

47
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,962
<i>Was thinking about you.</i>

48
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,614
<i>- How's it going?</i>
- You know, just another day in paradise.

49
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,908
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
- My boss is a total asshole.

50
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,327
- Gave one of my shifts to the new girl.
<i>- What a dick.</i>

51
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,121
- Yeah.
<i>- I can find some cash if you need it.</i>

52
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,624
Well,
that's really nice of you to offer.

53
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,185
- I'll pay you back.
<i>- I know you will.</i>

54
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,379
You know, just as soon as I get
on the other side of this shit.

55
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,089
- Okay.
<i>- It's been a couple weeks.</i>

56
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,882
<i>- Can I come up tomorrow night?</i>
- Yes!

57
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,343
- Yes, you can come home tomorrow!
<i>- Awesome.</i>

58
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,680
- Oh, the girls will be so excited.
<i>- Me, too. Can't wait.</i>

59
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,223
We'll see you tomorrow, baby.

60
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,516
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Great.

Shannan's coming for dinner.

68
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,856

Mom, did you ask her to come

73
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,457
- or was it her idea?
- No one has to ask.

74
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,334
This is still her home.

75
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,045
I'm still her mom
and we're still her family.

76
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,549
I'm thinking maybe we'll watch
that talent show video after dinner.

77
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,761
I think she'd get a kick out of that.

78
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,303
What?

79
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,138
Nothing.

80
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,351
Why can't you be happy for once?

81
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,246
Maybe she had to work.

82
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,710
She worked last night.

83
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,963
<i>This is Shannan.
I can't answer my phone now</i>

84
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,257
<i>because I'm doing something way more fun.</i>

85
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,092
Hey, Diva.

86
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,222
Look, I know you didn't mean it,
but I think Mom's really hurt.

87
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,015
Even though she'll never admit it.

88
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,438
You should call her and apologize.

89
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,733
Also, your boyfriend called.

90
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,154
Anyway...

91
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,615
I miss you, Diva.

92
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,486
- Sorry about last night.
- For what?

93
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,579
Well, I know you were looking forward
to Shannan coming home.

94
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,497
It's fine.

95
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,249
- Gonna get your butt in the shower today?
- Leave me alone.

96
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,960
- Are you sure you're okay?
- For Christ's sakes!

97
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,713
The world's not gonna end
'cause Shannan had a schedule conflict.

98
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,177
Hello.

99
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,513
Who?

100
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,810
Goddamn it.

101
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,689
Who is this?

102
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,985
Uh, how did you get this number?

103
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,282
Well, I don't know why you're asking me.
She hasn't lived here since she's 12.

104
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,886
So, if she owes you money,
you're barking up the wrong flagpole.

105
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,247
- Who is it?
- Some doctor.

106
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,249
What time is it? Oh, shit, I'm late.

107
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,959
He wanted to know if I'd seen Shannan.

108
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,589
Shannan's boyfriend called me last night,
asking if I knew where she was.

109
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,633
I thought they were just in a fight.

110
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,136
I've tried her five times, and each time
it's gone straight to voicemail.

111
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,389
Mom.

112
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,101
He's never called me before.

113
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,524
I'm sure it's fine. Give it a day.

114
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:28,985
She'll call.

115
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,238
What happened to your hand?

116
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,576
- What happened to your hand?
- I burned it.

117
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,717
It's been 48 hours.
When will you start looking?

118
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,261
For my daughter.

119
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,556
Hello? Hello?

120
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,601
- They hung up.
- They're not even looking for her?

121
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,895
They can't find her in the system.

122
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,271
What about that doctor?

123
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,524
- His number should be on the caller ID.
- It came up "unknown."

124
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,444
He said he was in Long Island.

125
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,529
Maybe we should start calling
the hospitals.

126
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,782
There are hundreds of hospitals
on Long Island.

127
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,326
Did something happen to Shannan?

128
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,456
A doctor on Long Island called me.

129
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,140
I'll put her in the system, ma'am.

130
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,798
Come on, girls.

131
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,927
I'm sorry, but unless
she's physically here with you,

132
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,429
I can't give you any information.

133
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,640
Nobody knows where she is,
and the police haven't done a thing.

134
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,185
Now, one way or another,
I am leaving with those phone records.

135
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,147
If you're you're not going to help me,
go get me someone who will.

136
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,111
- She has five.
- Five what?

137
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,321
Five cellphones.

138
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,908
Mom, why would Shannan need five phones?

139
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,453
Do you know where this boyfriend lives?

140
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,126
Okay, so when did you last see her?

141
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,714
So, she went to work in Long Island
and never came back.

142
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,467
Wanna know more? Ask her driver.

143
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,886
Okay? He was the one
that was supposed to bring her back.

144
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,888
What was Shannan doing in Long Island?

145
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,891
Selling Girl Scout cookies.
What you think?

146
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,976
Why don't you save time
and tell us what you did to her?

147
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,853
I would never hurt her.

148
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,736
Then why'd you hit her
so hard she had to have

149
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,565
a titanium plate grafted into her jaw?

150
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,485
You don't know shit about me,
little girl.

151
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,362
And you sure as shit
don't know about Shannan.

152
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,990
You take the money
and the gifts that she buys you,

153
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,201
and you don't think to ask
where it all comes from?

154
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,038
And when she comes home,
who do you think she's coming home to?

155
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,164
Hmm?

156
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,624
I was always there for her.

157
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,208
Were you?

158
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,462
Where can I find this driver?

159
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,934
You two wait here.

160
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,186
Mom,
I'm not letting you go in there alone.

161
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,232
Lock the doors.
We'll only be a minute.

162
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,733
I have my phone.

163
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,352
I'm looking for Shannan Gilbert.
I'm her mother.

164
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,813
You're Michael Pak, right?
Her driver.

165
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,863
You need to relax, lady.

166
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,738
Where is she?

167
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,992
We went out to Oak Beach.

168
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,745
She went in to see a guy.
Next thing, she's freaking out, okay?

169
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,997
What happened?

170
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,331
I'm just a driver.

171
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,708
I don't go in.

172
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,544
I wait in my car and then
I drive her home. That's all I do.

173
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,254
- That's all you do?
- Yeah.

174
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,298
Yeah, well, you didn't take her home.

175
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,884
Your daughter was hysterical that night.

176
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,218
She ran down the road,

177
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,470
banging on the door
of any house with a light on.

178
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,891
She wasn't making any sense,
she was shouting all kinds of gibberish.

179
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:52,975
I tried to help her.

180
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,103
But she wouldn't let me,
so I said fuck it.

181
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,855
Oh, fuck.

182
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,398
Oak Beach?

183
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,901
Way down Ocean Parkway,
past Jones Beach.

184
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,153
It's a gated community.
Miles from anything.

185
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,917
This is the last contact we had.

186
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,590
If you live in Ellenville
and your daughter lives in Jersey City,

187
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,111
what the hell are you guys doing here
in Suffolk County, hmm?

188
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,388
Well, her phone records are full of calls
from a 631 area code.

189
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,265
Have you filed a Missing Persons report?

190
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,643
Just phoned Jersey City,
they don't have a record of it.

191
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,979
- Mom, I don't feel so good.
- Just a second.

192
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,898
Just because she didn't come home,

193
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,984
it doesn't mean
it's a five-alarm fire now.

194
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,194
Right?

195
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,988
Okay. Then why was her last contact
with anyone

196
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,324
a 23-minute phone call to 911?

197
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,891
- <i>Hello?
- Shannan, get in the car!</i>

198
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,375
<i>Come on, what are you doing?</i>

199
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,888
<i>Miss, I can't help
if you don't tell me where you are.</i>

200
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,047
<i>What's wrong?</i>

201
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,551
<i>I'm having a hard time
getting a read on your location.</i>

202
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,637
<i>Come on, Shannan!
Come back!</i>

203
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,722
<i>Help me! Help!</i>

204
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,107
All right, um...

205
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,068
The report says the unit arrived at 5:40.

206
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,988
Officers interviewed several residents
who said they...

207
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,949
saw your daughter leave on her own
with no sign of, um...

208
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,451
suspicious activity.

209
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,706
This is her jacket.

210
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,916
Yeah, well,
as far as the 911 call goes,

211
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,918
the residents say that she was on drugs.

212
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,087
My daughter doesn't do drugs.

213
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,632
You got a close relationship
with her, Ms. Gilbert?

214
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,341
Excuse me?

215
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,345
What was she doing
in a gated community,

216
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,932
100 miles away from home
in the middle of the night?

217
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,103
Can I be frank here with you
just for a minute, please?

218
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,149
When girls like this go missing,

219
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,109
it's a high-risk environment.

220
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,196
You know, I mean, maybe she ran away,
maybe she'll turn up.

221
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,742
Hey. Do you think you could stop that
for one second, please, sweetheart?

222
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,035
Just one.

223
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,619
My daughter isn't on drugs.

224
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,581
She didn't run away. She's missing.

225
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,085
Now, I have been hung up on,
dismissed, and ignored,

226
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,504
but one thing I won't be is silenced.

227
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,716
Now, you say she's not missing. Fine.

228
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,052
That's your position, but here's mine.

229
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,471
She called for help at 4:51,

230
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,139
and you arrived at 5:40.

231
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:41,185
How in the fuck does it take an hour
to respond to a call like that?

232
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,690
Jesus.

233
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,152
Crack a window.

234
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,150
<i>Ocean Parkway is shut down
between Gilgo Beach and Oak Beach.</i>

235
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,236
<i>Police aren't saying much,
but what we do know</i>

236
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,987
<i>is that a police dog picked up a scent</i>

237
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,366
<i>and a canine officer, knowing there was
a Missing Persons report,</i>

238
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,992
<i>brought in a search team.</i>

239
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,911
<i>We expect to learn more tonight</i>

240
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,998
<i>when Suffolk County Police Commissioner,
Richard Dormer, holds a press conference.</i>

241
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,251
<i>Commissioner Dormer made news
earlier this year</i>

242
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,670
<i>after narrowly surviving
a vote of dismissal</i>

243
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,963
<i>for staffing level issues</i>

244
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,466
<i>that may have contributed to the deaths
of three voters.</i>

245
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,676
- Hey.
- Hey.

246
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,345
There's four in all.

247
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,555
They're skeletal.

248
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,641
They're wrapped in burlap.

249
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,353
And they're, uh...
They're spaced evenly apart.

250
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,188
There's... one down there,

251
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,399
here, here,

252
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,191
and over there.

253
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,385
<i>If the press starts to say
we got a serial killer on our hands,</i>

254
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,953
<i>this will blow up.
Keep this under control, Richard,</i>

255
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,789
<i>or your retirement could come sooner
than you planned. You got it?</i>

256
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,041
- Okay, sir.
<i>- All right, go handle it.</i>

257
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,125
Thank you.

258
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,670
Jesus fucking Christ.

259
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,591
Commissioner Dormer, sir,
they're ready for you.

260
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,970
- Commissioner!
- Sir, over here, please. Thanks.

261
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:44,224
- Sir, over here.
- While searching for a missing prostitute,

262
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,477
one of our officers has located...

263
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:52,065
four bodies in an area
along Ocean Parkway.

264
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,443
Were the bodies all left there
by the same person?

265
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,486
I can't say that.

266
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,198
This is an anomaly. There's...

267
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,491
There's no need for panic.

268
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,621
- That's all I have to say. Thank you.
- Sir, we have one more...

269
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,372
<i>Ellenville Diner.</i>

270
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,042
Hey. I need you to cover for me tonight.

271
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,336
<i>- Why? What happened?</i>
- I gotta go back.

272
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,838
<i>Where? Long Island, for Shannan?</i>

273
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,258
Yeah, the police station,
they found bodies.

274
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,885
<i>Oh, God. Do the girls know?</i>

275
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,803
Yeah, I'm about to tell them now.

276
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,889
<i>Of course. Don't worry about it.</i>

277
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,016
<i>I got you. Good luck.</i>

278
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,644
<i>- </i>Okay, thanks. I owe you.
<i>- Bye.</i>

279
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,814
- Hey.
- We gotta go back to Suffolk County.

280
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,650
Mom, what's going on?

281
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,070
Mom?

282
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,573
They don't tell you that over the phone.

283
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,633
When the units rolled up,
she's a ghost.

284
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,970
Residents seemed pretty calm about it.
Everything seemed to be kosher.

285
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,515
They figured that it was
a domestic disturbance

286
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,766
which resolved itself.

287
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,519
- What do you know about Oak Beach?
- I...

288
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,314
I know the guys like to go to parties
out there once in a while.

289
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,233
- Why?
- What kind of parties?

290
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,653
Oh, come on, Richard, you know.
Birthdays, bar mitzvahs,

291
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,822
<i>quinceañeras, </i>come on.
You know, come on.

292
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,825
- You think this is some kind of joke?
- No. I don't.

293
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,954
Look... she's not in my fucking trunk.

294
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,125
Your real problem is that one out there.

295
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:34,918
She's feisty.

296
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,132
Okay.

297
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,217
Let me handle it.

298
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,975
Okay, ladies,
come with me, please. This way.

299
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,435
Come on. Let's go.

300
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,322
Mrs. Gilbert.

301
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,284
Thank you for coming so quickly. I'm...

302
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,328
I'm Commissioner Dormer.

303
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,408
- I know it was a long drive...
- Are any of them her?

304
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,625
It appears not.

305
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,670
But we are working a grid

306
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,796
as we speak.

307
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,799
Tomorrow morning
we begin the aerial searches, first thing.

308
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,219
That's assuming she's...
You're searching everywhere, right?

309
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,679
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

310
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,560
I wanted to ask you some questions
about Shannan, if that's okay.

311
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:37,647
Is there anything that you can tell me
about the men in Shannan's life?

312
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,609
She has a boyfriend, Alex Diaz.

313
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,153
Anybody else we should be looking at?

314
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,155
A driver. Pak. Michael Pak.

315
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,782
What about the doctor?

316
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,409
What doctor?

317
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,079
He called me
the morning after she went missing.

318
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,414
He said he saw her and he helped her.

319
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,291
He runs a home for wayward girls.

320
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,001
What about her jacket?

321
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,253
We have the jacket and it's being tested.

322
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,842
Can you recall this doctor's name?

323
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,137
Fuck. Oh.

324
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,681
Harper? Haskell?

325
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,434
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
- I don't remember.

326
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,189
Mrs. Gilbert, there's a lot
we don't know at the moment.

327
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,818
Which is why it's really important

328
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,404
that you don't talk to the media.

329
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,030
Let us handle that.

330
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,492
One wrong word,
and they'll make a meal out of it.

331
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,160
It's in your best interest.

332
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Sharon's, too.

333
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,373
It's "Shannan."

334
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,127
<i>The beautiful beaches
of Long Island, New York</i>

335
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,671
<i>have become the latest backdrop</i>

336
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,089
<i>in a murder mystery.</i>

337
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,800
<i>The victims were engaged
in a high-risk business,</i>

338
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:51,346
<i>and these homicides appear to us
to be directly related to that business.</i>

339
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,182
<i>The Medical Examiner

341
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,812

<i>24-year-old Shannan Gilbert,</i>

343
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,107
<i>a prostitute from Jersey...</i>

344
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,737
I wish they wouldn't call her
a prostitute.

345
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,407
Well, what do you expect them
to call her, a lawyer?

346
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,826
I always told you, girls,

347
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,454
the choices you make
eventually catch up with you.

348
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,788
You've never said that.

349
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,251
It sounds like you're blaming her.

350
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,669
Maybe I should blame you

351
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,255
for not telling me
she's in an abusive relationship.

352
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:28,008
Like you not telling me
she was a prostitute?

353
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,760
Why didn't you do anything?

354
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,268
What else aren't you telling me?

355
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,321
I was waiting in the car like usual.

356
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,073
Uh, playing <i>Words with Friends.</i>

357
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,118
And that's when the john...

358
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,704
this fat fuck comes up to the window
and he says...

359
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,040
You gotta get her out of my house.

360
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,751
Fucking kidding me?

361
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,378
So, I went inside and...

362
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:09,341
Shannan was behind the couch
on her hands and knees, shaking.

363
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,749
- And she called 911.
<i>- Help me!</i>

364
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,489
- She started screaming.
<i>- Help me!</i>

365
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,682
- What are you doing? Shannan! Stop!
- Help! Somebody!

366
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,160
Shannan!

367
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,853
So then I said, "I'm trying to help you."

368
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,897
Finally, I said "Fuck it,"

369
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,816
you know, and just drove to Oak Beach
to knock on doors myself.

370
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,694
I talked to the john. Um...

371
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,448
Oh, I met this guy with a limp
who was actually willing to help.

372
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,993
What was the name of the john?

373
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,161
Brewer.

374
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,498
He must've done something to spook her.

375
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,220
<i>Suffolk County Police

384
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,912
What do you think?

385
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,421
- All the other girls have one.
- All the other girls are dead.

386
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,361
Their families invited us to a vigil.

387
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,635
- You've been talking to them?
- Online.

388

Oh, we're not going to any vigil.

389
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,098
- Why not?
- Because Shannan's not dead.

390

Either your phone's broke
or your secretary's a moron

415
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,880
because I must have left 50 messages

This is my daughter,
Shannan Maria Gilbert.

There's one here

until you either find her
or die of paper cuts.

420
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,938
- Do not ignore me.
- Nobody is ignoring you, Mrs. Gilbert.

421
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,567
I have a talent for holding grudges
and unless you help me,

422
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,986
I'm gonna raise more hell
than you can handle.

And don't you ever fucking call
my daughter a prostitute again!

424
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:15,044
Okay, tell them we'll do the vigil,
but we want to meet them first.

425
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,089
- And make sure everybody comes.
- What are you wearing?

426
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,947
It's a long way to Oak Beach.

427
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,826
- What were you guys talking about?
- I don't know. I...

428
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,788
work.

429
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,248
The weather...

430

Her and her boyfriend sneaking Taco Bell

431
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,255
in the new Freddy movie
over at the Hudson Mall.

432
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,635
Did she say anything
about going to visit her mom?

433
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,809
Wait. Are you serious?

434
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,023
Do you know anything about her mom?

435
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,738
Oh, my God. These women are so pathetic.

436
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,990
The less we say, the better.

437
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,535
We don't need them knowing
our personal business.

438
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,287
What's that for?

439
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,122
My notebook. I'm gonna take notes.

440
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,256
Maybe we should go around?

441
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:46,344
I'm Missy. I drove in from Connecticut
for my sister, Maureen.

442
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,472
It's so good
to finally meet all of you in person.

443
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,682
Mom.

444
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,936
Say something.

445
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,190
Uh, Lorraine.

446
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,361
My daughter's Megan.

447
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,700
I sold my TV to be here from Maine,

448
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,494
so I have the cash to stay here
until the vigil.

449
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,038
I'm Lynn.

450
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,209
My daughter is Melissa.

451
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,421
This is my other daughter, Amanda.

452
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,047
We came here from Buffalo.

453
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,262
Oh. Kim is here.

454
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,059
Sorry, I'm late, y'all.

455
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,229
We were just going around
introducing ourselves.

456
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,565
Where we're from, who we've lost.

457
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,649
Okay. Kim...

458
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,402
North Carolina. Um...

459
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,529
I like Rocky Road ice cream

460
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,573
and long walks on the beach,

461
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,033
and my sister was Amber.

462
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,913
Did I miss anything?

463
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,376
<i>Wait. Are you serious?</i>

464
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,087
<i>Do you know anything about her mom?</i>

465
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,715
<i>'Cause she's a real piece of work.</i>

466
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,302
<i>Yeah, abandoned her own daughter
when she was just a kid.</i>

467
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,556
<i>Shannan was in and out of foster homes
her whole life.</i>

468
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,809
<i>All her mom is good for
is taking her money.</i>

469
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,064
<i>Doesn't even care how Shannan made it.</i>

470
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,734
<i>Just as long as she shared the wealth.</i>

471
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,237
My daughter had three cellphones.

472
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,740
My daughter had three cellphones.

473
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:34,702
She was working on the... Craigslist.

474
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,537
Yes, so did Maureen.

475
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,081
So did Melissa.

476
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,583
They all did.
That's why they're all so the same,

477
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,710
because online,
you can practically go shopping.

478
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,963
Sooner or later,
they're gonna get this guy.

479
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,297
There's gotta be some...

480
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,508
computer trace they can do.

481
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,551
. Mm-mm. They don't get you on email.

482
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,470
You post a number, then they call.

483
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:56,224
Which is untraceable
because the girls work on burner phones.

484
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,059
Look at you, knowing your shit.

485
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,229
They think they're all drug addicts.

486
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,232
- Melissa wasn't even into drugs.
- Neither was Maureen.

487
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,191
She drank.

488
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,152
Drinking's better than drugs
because it's legal.

489
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,780
But coke is the best way
to keep a call going.

490
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,740
Make some real bank.

491
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,036
Your girls knew that,
whether you want to believe it or not.

492
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,209
They told me
Megan was where she wants to be.

493
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,043
That, uh...

494
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,172
That she didn't love me.

495
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,679
As sad as it is,
I feel some kind of relief.

496
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,265
At least they're finally paying attention.

497
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,348
Are you shitting me?

498
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,187
If you think they give one goddamn
about these girls, you're delusional.

499
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,940
They weren't searching for them.

500
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,611
A cop stopped along the side of the road
to let his dog take a shit.

501
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,780
He accidentally found them.

502
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,198
What I meant was...

503
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:59,037
at least it's on the news
and people are aware of it.

504
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,664
Have you watched the news?

505
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,626
It's all, "He's a cop," "He's a clammer,"
he's this, he's that.

506
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,378
It's all "him," "him," "him."

507
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,548
What about our girls?
Who's talking about them?

508
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:15,094
And when they do,
it's "prostitute," "hooker,"

509
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,513
"sex worker," "escort."

510
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,516
Never "friend," "sister,"

511
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,477
"mother," "daughter."

512
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,854
They don't care.

513
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,731
They blame them.

514
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,693
And it's our job, as mothers,

515
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,487
and sisters,

516
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,531
to make sure these girls
are not forgotten.

517
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,826
So, should we wait on the vigil?

518
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,455
No, we're doing the vigil.
We're going to Oak Beach,

519
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,957
to their front fucking yard.

520
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,360
Who tipped them off?

521
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,284
This is a private community!
I'll call the police!

522
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,662
Go ahead.
It'll take them an hour to get here.

523
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,792
Speaking of which,
can I borrow your phone?

524
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,627
Sure. Why?

525
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,337
They already know my number.

526
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,886
There's a crazy lady
about to tear through Oak Beach.

527
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,265
Come quick.

528
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,584
Who lives here?

529
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,212
The son of a bitch who hired her.

530
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,113
Mom?

531
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,620
Mom.

532
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,303
Twelve minutes.

533
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:49,517
Now we both you know you can show up
on time and your secretary's not a retard.

534
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:53,145
Can we just go back to my office
and talk about this?

535
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,438
We'll talk right here.

536
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,233
This is a...

537
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,485
This is a private community.

538
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,612
Well, then why don't you arrest me?

539
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,698
Listen, I came here to do you a favor.

540
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,908
I don't want to see you
hauled away in handcuffs.

541
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,369
Don't you understand
that when the uniforms get here,

542
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:12,081
- they're gonna cite you for trespassing.
- Okay, let me get this straight.

543
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,167
My daughter calls for help
but it takes you an hour to get here,

544
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,919
but the Stepford Wives call you

545
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,547
and you show up in less time
than it takes to make a sandwich!

546
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,634
Whatever it is that you're looking for,
Mrs. Gilbert, it is not here.

547
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:27,096
Okay, then why did my 14-year-old
just find her sister's earring

548
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,432
outside the home of the man
that you just set free?

549
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,394
Shannan went screaming through here
at 4:51 in the morning,

550
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,271
and no one helped her.

551
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,481
Where is the outrage? Where's the concern?

552
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,484
Four dead bodies show up
in my neighborhood,

553
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,237
I'd be shouting from the rooftops
to get to the bottom of it.

554
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,323
What are they hiding?

555
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,452
What are you hiding, Mrs. Gilbert?

556
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,331
You never told me
that Shannan grew up in foster care.

557
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,378
You never told me
you nearly got shit-canned

558
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,297
for mismanaging your department.

559
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,198
Keep up the good work, Commissioner.

560
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,313
Fuck's sake.

561
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:26,113
I wrote down every house number
and license plate I saw.

562
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:29,200
We need to talk to these people
and these people.

563
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,243
They might've seen her.

564
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,496
No one's gonna talk
'cause they want us out.

565
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:38,250
These guys are looking out for each other.
They all have friends in Suffolk PD.

566
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,837
The police said
everybody passed lie detector tests.

567
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,382
Yeah, but anybody
can pass a lie detector test

568
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,385
if all they ask you is "What's your name,
and your favorite color?"

569
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,763
It sounds like Shannan's running
from her driver.

570
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,015
You can hear him in the 911 call.

571
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,266
That makes no sense.

572
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,479
I don't care how fucked up I am,
my ass is going to that driver

573
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,814
because he's my way out.

574
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,108
He's my safety.
That's what you pay him for.

575
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,279
Well, maybe he was mad she didn't pay him.

576
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,407
Why would she all of a sudden
not pay her driver?

577
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,621
Maybe because she was bringing money home.

578
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,209
Okay, do you don't know
she didn't pay him. You're just guessing.

579
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,710
Well, I'm assuming.

580
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,548
She's probably forced to get stoned,
drunk, high...

581
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,425
- Not forced.
- Okay, whatever.

582
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,552
I'm just saying, I've lived it.

583
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,762
Well, I'm just saying, you're not Shannan.

584
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,226
Mari, I feel for you...

585
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,854
more than I feel for myself

586
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,691
or any of the other ladies here,
because Shannan's still missing.

587
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,944
And knowing is better than not knowing.

588
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,115
But you don't really think that...

589
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,963
I'm just saying it might be good to accept
that there's another ending to all this.

590
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,884
What's that ending,
if you know so goddamned much?

591
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,277
Hello?

592
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,405
<i>Is this Mari Gilbert?</i>

593
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,114
Yes.

594
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,784
<i>My name's Joe Scalise.</i>

595
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,204
<i>I have some information
you're gonna want to hear.</i>

596
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,760
I'm a neighbor of Joe Brewer,
the john.

597
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,390
I got your number
from one of those fliers you posted.

598
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,310
Suffolk PD don't return my calls no more.

599
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,689
You're gonna learn
that the good people of Oak Beach,

600
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,067
if they live by one thing, it's this:

601
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,194
be wary of those who would...

602
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,490
who would ruin a very good thing.

603
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:43,162
You are, madam,
the wayfarer they've been dreading.

604
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,840
I didn't know Shannan was a prostitute.

605
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,052
I didn't know she was bringing home money.

606
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,889
She doesn't let anyone help her.

607
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,018
I thought we were doing this together.

608
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,605
So fucking annoying.

609
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,358
Sorry.

610
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,942
We weren't following you.

611
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,110
We kind of were.

612
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,990
What are you two talking about?

613
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,201
Families.

614
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,952
Yeah.

615
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,955
Tell me something nice about Shannan.

616
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,585
She graduated high school two years early.

617
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,505
She was smart.

618
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,217
And she was the first one
in our family to go to college.

619
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,262
I called her "Diva."

620
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,974
Because she's such a little diva.

621
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,270
Amber stood 4'11"

622
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,731
and weighed 100 pounds soaking wet.

623
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,486
Her legs looked like
little chicken drumsticks.

624
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,951
I spoke to her the day she went missing.

625
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,079
We were in a fight.

626
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:30,888
You're walking through

627
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,063
what used to be
the killer's dumping ground.

628
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,023
He only moved the bodies to the road

629
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:39,027
because this whole area is set to be
drained as part of the mosquito project.

630
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,451
That means people poking around,
seeing things they shouldn't.

631
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,372
Here.

632
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,874
Look.

633
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,962
This is where he keeps his supplies.

634
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,256
But... where?

635
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,345
Go, go, go.

636
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,785
- Shit like that happens.
- What's up?

637
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:12,853
Oh, God.

638
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,563
Easy. Just...

639
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,079
Joe Brewer didn't kill Shannan.

640
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,250
He may be a sociopath,
but he's not the psychopath.

641
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,628
That honor goes to Peter Hackett.

642
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,423
Dr. Hackett?

643
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,493
Look, I know you
and your buddies don't give a shit.

644
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,102
Don't worry. You're not gonna have to
put up with me much longer.

645
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,897
But for the moment, this is my case.
Okay?

646
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,733
- I want a suspect. I want a name.
- Okay.

647
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,402
Peter Hackett. Dr. Peter Hackett.

648
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,987
He lives in Oak Beach.

649
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,240
It's nice to see you again, Ms. Gilbert.

650
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,909
I saw spools of burlap in a shed
by his house.

651
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,204
Come on. What are you talking about?
Every clammer, contractor, landscaper

652
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,998
- has got burlap by his house. Come on.
- But a doctor?

653
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,836
I tell you what, why don't you let
the policemen do the police work, honey?

654
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,796
- Why don't you suck my dick?
- Classy.

655
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,047
This is the guy who called me

656
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,633
the morning after she disappeared.
He said that he helped her.

657
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,609
Come on. Aren't you gonna write it down?

658
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,388
Are you fucking kidding me? Hmm?

659
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,890
Write it down.

660
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:32,974
What?

661
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,602
I said write it down.

662
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,097
I googled Sarra's medication.

663
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,349
So I know it's a mood stabilizer.

664
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,939
She told me you took her
to a psychiatrist.

665
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,524
Why didn't you tell me?

666
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,902
There's nothing to tell.

667
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,697
It takes six weeks for the medication
to have any effect,

668
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,990
so we'll know more then.

669
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,999
Hello. Can I help you?

670
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,882
Peter Hackett's the best neighbor
you can have.

671
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:32,302
Ever there's a problem,
he's always the first one to call.

672
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,763
Do you remember anything from that night?

673
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,766
Yeah,
that girl was pretty well drugged up.

674
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,102
- What?
- She couldn't hardly stand.

675
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,688
- Excuse me?
- She almost fell down twice

676
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,273
- when I was talking to her.
- Wait, you saw her?

677
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,526
- Why didn't you call the police?
- I did.

678
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,613
- What was she saying?
- It wasn't making sense.

679
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,491
"Help me. Help me.
They're going to kill me."

680
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,994
So I sat her down on the porch,

681
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,371
and I said, "Relax."

682
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,749
I told her that I called the police
and they were on their way.

683
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,877
As soon as I said that, she ran.

684
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,546
Anyhow...

685
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,882
- What?
- ...she fell down the stairs and...

686
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,843
she ran that way.

687
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,390
Wait,
do those security cameras work?

688
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,953
Is this where they keep
the security footage?

689
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,830
Are you from the news?

690
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,541
We, unfortunately, don't have it
from that night.

691
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,878
It gets taped over automatically.
It runs on a loop. I'm sorry.

692
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,629
But the police got a copy, right?

693
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,674
We found it odd they never asked.

694
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,387
I'm sorry, who are you?

695
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,475
Why didn't you give it to them?

696
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:03,518
Why don't I get my husband?

697
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,228
He oversees all that.

698
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,314
I just came by to drop off his lunch.

699
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,213
How can I help you? Dr. Peter Hackett.

700
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,758
My wife tells me you're a reporter.

701
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,510
I've lived here for 30 years.

702
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,595
There's not a thing I don't know
about Oak Beach.

703
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:43,809
We're like a miniature government here,
and I pound the gavel.

704
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,981
Barbara, why don't you put on some coffee?

705
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,399
It's on, dear.

706
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,069
Then why don't you refresh it?

707
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,703
I, uh... recognize you from the news.

708
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,580
I'm so sorry.

709
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,042
What happened?

710
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,796
Well, that's the $64,000 question.

711
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,507
But you called me.

712
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,175
I beg your pardon?

713
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,518
<i>Unit report
to mile marker 10.46, Ocean Parkway</i>

714
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,436
<i>for possible remains sighting.</i>

715
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,513
Just arriving.
Going to check it out. Stand by.

716
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:03,471
We got a 10-54 on Ocean Parkway
near Cedar Beach.

717
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,016
Fuck.

718
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,993
Last place Shannan was seen
was in clear view of a video camera,

719
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,412
and Hackett's in charge of the footage!

720
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,497
Okay. I'll look into it.

721
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,749
He erased it.

722
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,376
What? Did you find something?

723
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,140
Mrs. Gilbert,
you really shouldn't be here.

724
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,532
- Can you take her to the road?
- What did you find?

725
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,883
Let go of me.

726
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,676
What's in the bag?

727
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,095
This one's not like the other four.

728
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,014
Those were in the bramble a mile away.

729
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,476
There's no burlap on this one, either,
or hyoid bones.

730
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,231
Any indication of a jaw plate?

731
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,314
No, sir.

732
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,194
Right. Let's go.

733
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:25,762
<i>Two dozen police recruits
expanded the search for bodies today</i>

734
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,430
<i>from the thicket to the beach.</i>

735
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,392
<i>Suffolk County Police also expanded
the total search area.</i>

736
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,854
<i>This platoon of recruits conducted
a grid-pattern search on Cedar Beach.</i>

737
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,900
<i>It's between Gilgo and Oak Beach,
where the previous bodies were found.</i>

738
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:41,569
<i>Since last year,
the search has been hampered</i>

739
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,822
<i>by the harsh conditions in the thicket.</i>

740
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:48,076
<i>Hard, wiry brush called Virginia Weepers
and Bittersweet so thick,</i>

741
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,870
<i>you cannot see a person or dog
just ten feet away.</i>

742
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,879
Dr. Peter Hackett.

743
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:06,386
Kim's working again.

744
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,432
"Carolina" is her street name.
She posted this an hour ago.

745
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,851
Oh, Kim.

746
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,311
What is she thinking?

747
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,317
I'm a busy guy.

748
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,861
I make and take a lot of calls.

749
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:26,323
But how would I call a woman
I don't even know?

750
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,907
I'm a doctor...

751
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,035
not a magician.

752
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:36,041
She said that...

753
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,711
that you told her
that you helped her daughter.

754
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,048
I hope she doesn't blame herself

755
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,967
for the life her daughter led.

756
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,094
But...

757
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,765
apples don't fall far from the tree.

758
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,600
Am I right?

759
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:00,940
So, what do you remember from that night?

760
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:06,112
I think that's when Barbara and I
were in Florida.

761
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,240
- Oh.
- You ever been marlin fishing?

762
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:10,992
But you were here.

763
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:15,997
Because when the daughter's boyfriend
came the next morning to look for her,

764
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,584
didn't you offer to help search for her?

765
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,421
Florida might have been...

766
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,674
- the week before.
- Oh, okay.

767
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:30,011
That's right.
I saw this kid tooling around,

768
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:33,598
and he told me his story
and I couldn't turn him away.

769
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,184
That's what we do around here,
we help people.

770
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,773
With all due respect, Dr. Hackett,

771
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,944
you're living in a gated community
with a sign that says:

772
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,821
"Be nice or leave."

773
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,617
I don't know that that sends
that particular message.

774
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,078
Look... the police came.

775
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,996
They said everything was kosher.

776
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,080
Right.

777
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,666
But...

778
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:05,130
why didn't you show them
the security footage?

779
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,923
Why didn't they ask for it?

780
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,677
This is not my investigation, <i>kemosabe.</i>

781
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,846
You're the head honcho.

782
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,558
Maybe you ought to teach your cops better.

783
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,686
A girl goes missing

784
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,521
and you have a tape.

785
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,861
Are you telling me
that you didn't at least watch it?

786
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,240
That would be tampering with evidence.

787
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,034
Am I right?

788
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,944
Peter Hackett
is a self-important blowhard.

789
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,573
The very fact
that he's not leading the charge in this

790
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,493
is all the evidence you need
to point a finger.

791
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,369
Okay, if that's true,

792
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,206
why wasn't Shannan found
with the other girls?

793
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,833
'Cause the attack on her
didn't go as planned.

794
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,168
She'd gone off running.

795
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,754
People had seen her. The police came.

796
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,839
It just became too risky.

797
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:33,301
He tells people
that he runs a home for wayward girls.

798
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,012
That he rehabs them. That he saves them.

799
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,348
What he really means is he buries them.

800
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,893
He's got an examination table
in his living room.

801
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:45,021
And his "home for wayward girls"

802
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:48,525
is really just code for "graveyard."

803
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,108
Then where is Shannan?

804
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,446
In his backyard.

805
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,281
The marsh.

806
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,505
It's the one place they haven't searched.

807
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,816
We found another one.

808
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,485
Pieces, dismembered.

809
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,029
Forensics says it matches
a pair of severed legs

810
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,698
found in a plastic bag in '96.

811
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,743
- '96?
- Yeah, '96.

812
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:45,331
Are you telling me
that somebody's been dumping bodies

813
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,376
in Ocean Parkway for 15 fucking years?

814
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,960
Well...

815
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,754
it looks like it.

816
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,715
Hey, what is this?

817
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,509
Shannan Gilbert's medical records?
Come on, seriously?

818
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:00,054
You really think you're gonna find
any answers in these medical records?

819
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,475
Look, if she was still around,
we would have found her by now.

820
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,185
I mean, honestly,

821
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:09,105
who spends this much time
looking for a missing hooker?

822
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,326
If you're here to give me some big speech,
save it.

823
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,786
I already heard it from the others.

824
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,332
Kim, I know you're strong,

825
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:30,627
and you think you can handle
whatever comes your way, but...

826
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,379
this is just plain stupid.

827
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,800
Everyone has their destiny.

828
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,429
Maybe Amber's was Amber's,
and maybe this is mine.

829
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,476
You don't really believe that.

830
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,274
You're only doing this because deep down,
you think that's all you're worth,

831
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,568
but that's not true.

832
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,448
You tell that to Shannan?

833
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,709
I got Amber into this, you know?

834
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,674
You tried, Mari.

835
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,727
- Here.
- Thank you.

836
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:33,064
Lynn's boyfriend knew a guy.
We're all wearing them to the vigil.

837
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,779
- Turn on the TV.
- Why?

838
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,784
<i>...there's also no evidence to suggest</i>

839
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,620
<i>that it's the work of a single killer.</i>

840
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:50,248
<i>Although Shannan GIlbert</i>

841
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,168
<i>coincidentally went missing
at the same time in the same place,</i>

842
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,212
<i>she doesn't fit the victim profile.</i>

843
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:59,006
<i>She was the only one
who didn't come to Oak Beach alone</i>

844
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,383
<i>because she had a driver.</i>

845
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:01,759
Oh, God.

846
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,137
<i>We will continue
to look for her, but...</i>

847
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,806
<i>until we find evidence of foul play,</i>

848
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:10,184
<i>Miss Gilbert will no longer be considered</i>

849
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,395
<i>a part of this larger case.</i>

850
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,497
<i>Commissioner...</i>

851
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,281
- <i>That's all for the moment.
- </i>Fuck!

852
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,655
Yeah, this is Mari Gilbert...

853
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,033
Hey, you okay?

854
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:31,080
They stopped looking for Shannan.
They're not looking for her anymore.

855
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,083
- It's okay.
- What are we gonna do?

856
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,377
- Hey.
- Why did they...

857
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:38,087
That's why we're here.

858
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:40,839
Okay?

859
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,717
Yeah, right.

860
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,682
You're okay.

861
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,279
I'll just be a minute.

862
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,121
How can you say Shannan's not connected?

863
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,415
She was last seen
three miles from the other girls.

864
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,751
She was in her 20s, just like them.

865
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,336
She was small, just like them.

866
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,922
She was on Craigslist, just like them.

867
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,674
None of those other girls
would've been found if it wasn't for her.

868
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,052
It doesn't mean
that we're gonna stop looking for her.

869
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,929
- Mom! Mom!
- What about Hackett?

870
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:29,722
Even if he did call you, it...

871
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:31,808
it's not evidence of guilt.

872
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,392
Lying about it is.

873
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:36,062
I understand that you're angry,
Mrs. Gilbert, but...

874
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:40,525
a policeman deals in evidence, not anger.

875
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,902
Ha, ha!
What fortune cookie did you read that in?

876
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,465
Mom, hurry. They're waiting.

877
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,988
Give me a minute!

878
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,749
You have no idea, you know,

879
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,877
no clue what worry really is.

880
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:03,172
We have Shannan's medical records.

881
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:05,800
Yeah? What do they say?

882
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,848
I'll tell you what they don't say.

883
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:16,143
They don't say how she used to
shove her fingers down her throat

884
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,979
and puke until her mouth bled.

885
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:21,148
They don't say how she ran out
into the snow one night

886
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:24,026
with no clothes on
and nearly froze half to death

887
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,780
while I was out working graveyards
and doubles just to keep the lights on.

888
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:32,660
Yeah. Look, Mari, I know
that you gave her away to foster care,

889
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:36,080
and I know you think it's your
responsibility to bring her home again.

890
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:38,165
But this isn't on you.

891
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,002
I'm her mother.

892
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:43,629
It's all on me.

893
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:58,561
You gave her away?

894
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:02,356
Oh, for fuck's sake, Sherre,
can we not do this right now?

895
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,775
You lied to me.

896
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,903
I didn't lie.

897
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:09,822
You told me the state took her.

898
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,077
What was I supposed to say?

899
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,580
"Mommy gave your sister away

900
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,874
because she couldn't get her
the help she needed."

901
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,460
Do you think I wanted that for Shannan?

902
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:25,171
Do you think I didn't try to do
everything in my power

903
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,881
to get her the help she needed?

904
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,968
Shannan was bipolar.

905
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,511
She was a mess.

906
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,348
I took her to doctors I couldn't afford

907
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,391
who gave her drugs that she wouldn't take

908
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:40,561
that had side-effects
that I couldn't stand to watch.

909
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,648
I was just a kid.

910
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,819
What she needed was love.

911
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,907
It was the only thing she ever wanted
her whole...

912
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,159
fucking life.

913
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,287
Okay, but how do you know
what she felt?

914
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,206
Because I feel it too, Mom.

915
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,961
Shannan may be gone but I'm still here.

916
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:08,965
I'm still here.

917
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,177
Oh, my God.

918
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,513
These fucking women,
they've brainwashed you.

919
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,849
You wanna know why they're so dead set
on this vigil?

920
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:20,977
It's their way of denying

921
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,020
what god-awful mothers
and sisters they were.

922
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,815
They've convinced you that
we are like them, but we are not, honey.

923
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,233
We are nothing like them.

924
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:29,693
You're right.

925
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:34,824
No, we're not like them at all.

926
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,534
They're a family.

927
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,498
I wish they were my family.

928
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:45,209
Okay. Well, maybe your new family
will pay for your college

929
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,420
because I sure as shit can't afford it.

930
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,425
Are you gonna give away Sarra next?

931
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,343
Hmm?

01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,650
You're lucky, you know?

944
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,174
<i>This is Shannan.
I can't answer my phone right now</i>

945
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,467
<i>because I'm doing something way more fun.</i>

946
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:39,777
You can be a real asshole, you know that?

947
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:44,031
But you're an asshole people listen to.

948
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,534
And if they don't, you make 'em.

949
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:51,789
I don't got what you got.

950
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,378
Neither does she, or her, or any of us.

951
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,297
We was never gonna be
Mother of the Year, but...

952
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,843
given the circumstances...

953
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:08,681

- Hello?
<i>- Is this Mari?</i>

963
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,747
- Yes.
<i>- It's Joe Scalise.</i>

964
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,624
<i>From Oak Beach.</i>

965
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,044
<i>Dr. Hackett put his house up for sale.</i>

966
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:46,380
Well, great. Call Robin Leach.

967
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:49,049
<i>His car is already packed.</i>

968
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,051
<i>He's gonna disappear.</i>

969
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:55,139
<i>If you ever want to talk to him,
this could be your last chance.</i>

970
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:24,376
<i>You wanna talk?</i>

971
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:26,086
Talk.

972
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:29,381
You've already upended my life.

973
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:32,968
You're implying I chased after this girl.

974
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:35,512
I can't catch up to myself
walking backwards.

975
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,645
- Yes, but...
- When I was young,

976
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:47,608
I was... stranded on a skiff...

977
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,109
in the water...

978
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:51,778
in the dark.

979
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:55,699
I was all alone

980
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:58,744
and scared I was... gonna die.

981
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,704
Then I saw this boat.

982
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:04,541
It was far away, but...

983
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,002
I sent up a flare,

984
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:09,421
and they came to save me.

985
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:12,758
The next day,

986
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:16,637
I enrolled in emergency medicine.

987
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:23,018
Ever since, my specialty has been...

988
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:26,188
saving lives.

989
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:31,193
If she's out there, we gotta find her.

990
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,282
You're the real hero.

991
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,537
A mother who would go to any lengths

992
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:43,747
for her daughter.

993
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:49,336
That is true heroism.

994
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,553
Oh.

995
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,638
Mrs. Gilbert.

996
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,559
Nice to see you again.

997
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:07,104
Don't worry.
I left my staple gun at home.

998
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,107
So how did you get in my office?

999
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:12,776
It's not your office anymore.

1000
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:15,153
True. True.

1001
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:20,826
Yeah, they're putting me out to pasture,
as they say.

1002
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,328
What do you think
you'll be most remembered for?

1003
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:25,872
What can I help you with?

1004
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:30,877
Why haven't you searched the marsh?

1005
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:34,590
It's the only place in Oak Beach
you haven't searched.

1006
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:37,926
Because a grown man
can't get through there,

1007
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,554
never mind a 100-pound girl.

1008
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:43,599
Yeah, but it borders Anchor Way
where Shannan was last seen,

1009
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:46,018
and Larboard Court
where Peter Hackett lives.

1010
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,770
Ah, so this is about Hackett.

1011
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,565
We've already cleared him.

1012
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,942
What... You gotta talk to Joe Scalise.

1013
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:57,863
Joe Scalise
is a paranoid conspiracy freak.

1014
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,531
He and Hackett hate each other.

1015
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,825
Some dispute they had years ago over land.

1016
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,660
He wants to bury Hackett.

1017
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,078
Maybe he's giving you the shovel.

1018
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:07,539
What about her jacket?

1019
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:11,960
If Hackett had contact with Shannan,
her jacket would prove it.

1020
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,921
It would have skin cells
or fibers on it or something.

1021
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:19,301
We don't have the jacket.

1022
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:23,055
When they first picked it up,
Shannan wasn't officially missing

1023
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:24,848
and it got lost.

1024
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:31,188
What is this, some kind of cover-up
or just incompetence?

1025
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:33,982
Search the marsh or I'm going on the news.

1026
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,574
<i>A year ago,
the police first discovered the remains</i>

1027
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:28,620
<i>of three bodies dumped along
the side of the road off Ocean Park...</i>

1028
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,481
- What's happening?
- They're draining the marsh,

1029
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:56,565
looking for that hooker.

1030
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:58,567
Mari!

1031
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:00,443
Lorraine.

1032
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:05,949
- What are you doing here?
- I came for the anniversary vigil.

1033
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,951
The others are on their way.

1034
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:09,119
Hey, don't worry.

1035
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,372
We're not gonna let you
go through this alone. All right?

1036
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:16,144
<i>Heavy equipment, including a backhoe,</i>

1037
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,754
<i>were brought in to dig through
the thick brush and marsh.</i>

1038
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,131
<i>The commissioner says
the area was too tough</i>

1039
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:23,300
<i>for the searchers to get through on foot.</i>

1040
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:27,721
<i>Here in Oak Beach,
missing sex worker, Shannan Gilbert,</i>

1041
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:30,640
<i>was last seen alive
leaving a client's house.</i>

1042
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,286
<i>During the search
for Shannan Gilbert last year,</i>

1043
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,020
<i>four other bodies were discovered.</i>

1044
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:39,357
<i>There are now ten sets of remains,
half of whom are still unidentified.</i>

1045
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,961
<i>According to the police,
Shannan Gilbert's disappearance</i>

1046
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:43,361
<i>is unrelated to those.</i>

1047
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,031
<i>We believe that Shannan Gilbert
ran into that area</i>

1048
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,574
<i>the night she disappeared.</i>

1049
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:49,034
<i>She's in there someplace,</i>

1050
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,828
<i>and we're going to do
everything we can to find her.</i>

1051
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,795
Thanks, Missy. Yeah, I owe you.

1052
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:02,798
Okay, see you soon.

1053
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,675
Missy's gonna
pick up the girls on her way.

1054
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:09,471
Your hands are shaking.

1055
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:14,684
They say not knowing is worse
than knowing, but I'm not so sure.

1056
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:17,270
And if they find her,

1057
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,231
I know she's gone,

1058
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:21,441
but I'll still be angry.

1059
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:25,237
And if they don't find her,

1060
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:28,197
I have hope.

1061
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,911
Yeah, but you're still angry.

1062
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:36,790
How do I get rid of the anger?

1063
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,960
Well, you stop blaming yourself.

1064
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:42,921
It's not your fault.

1065
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:44,672
Yeah?

1066
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:47,777
- I think we got something!
- What do you got down there?

1067
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,930
- Get a camera down here!
- Rope this off right now!

1068
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,173
- Over there.
- We gonna need a cradle?

1069
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,663
What did they find?

1070
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:20,166
- I'll call you back.
- Show me! No...

1071
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,395
- Let her through.
- Get the fuck out of my way!

1072
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,045
- What did they find?
- Let her through.

1073
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,715
What's over there? What's over there?

1074
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:28,049
What is it?

1075
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:31,303
Tell me right now, goddamn it!
What did you find?

1076
01:21:31,761 --> 01:21:32,888
Please!

1077
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:45,482
Officer.

1078
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,221
Hey...

1079
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,061
I'm sorry.

1080
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:27,979
I'm gonna take you home.

1081
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:15,777
As much as today is about Shannan,

1082
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:17,320
it's not just about Shannan.

1083
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:19,030
It's about all of us...

1084
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:23,576
every one of us and our friends and family
that were affected by this.

1085
01:25:28,873 --> 01:25:30,416
The police failed us.

1086
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:33,294
They failed every one of our girls.

1087
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,132
They failed to keep them safe
when they were at risk.

1088
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:40,051
They failed to take their disappearances
seriously,

1089
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:43,471
and they failed to go after the people
who took advantage of our girls.

1090
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,515
Some of them may even be those people.

1091
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:47,809
<i>And they ignored me,</i>

1092
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:50,728
<i>just like they ignored Shannan
the night she called for help</i>

1093
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,772
<i>and waited an hour for them to arrive.</i>

1094
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:06,035
Why are our girls to blame
at the exclusion of everybody else?

1095
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:11,708
It's time for accountability,
and I'm starting with myself.

1096
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:38,776
Let's go home.

1097
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,796
This is why we're here.
This is my daughter, Shannan.

1098
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:43,299
And she won't be forgotten.

1099
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,218

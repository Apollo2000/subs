That's strange, because
I was sure that you took it.

It's very unprofessional.

Okay!

378

Yes.

that sent them down the left

out the front door
and not the back!

decisions like that again.

00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:40,394
So, tell me why cops
are risking their lives
to get to you, Bishop?

600
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,268
Why should I answer
that question?

601
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,807
Because I'm thinking
about sending you out
to the wolves...

602
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,002
and saving my own ass
if you don't.

603
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,082
I assume you know
who I am, Sergeant.
You're a scumbag gangster.

604
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:05,918
And one of my scumbag partners
in crime is your fellow
officer, Marcus Duvall.

605
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,456
Marcus Duvall
and his entire team.

606
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,626
We used to split things 50-50.
Marcus got greedy.
He wanted more.

607
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,366
So, you killed
Ray Portnow?
After he tried
to kill me.

608
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:18,662
Right.

609
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,709
They're here
to execute me because
if I make it to court...

610
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,940
every single one of them
goes to jail
for the rest of their days.

611
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,176
How many cops
are involved in this?

612
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:32,117
I can't say exactly, but
the blood money runs through
your entire department.

613
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:36,852
I bet they're all here now
and they can't allow me
to leave this precinct alive.

614
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,059
They can't allow any of us
to leave here alive.

615
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,164
Now that we all know
it's them out there.

616
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:45,996
Sarge.

617
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:51,803
Poor guy, he never had
a chance. Anyone know
if he had any family?

618
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,734
ALEX: Someone's coming!
Shit, someone's coming!

619
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,743
Someone's coming.
All right. Jasper.

620
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,745
H it squad, Sergeant.

621
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,387
They're here
for all of us.
Me?

622
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,719
All of us. You especially.

623
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,628
Fuck you, dealer.
This is all your fault.

624
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,358
Those are your brethren
out there, old man, not mine.

625
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,992
Don't compare me
with your scumbag friends
out there.

626
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,037
If it was up to me,
I'd kick your ass
out the door.

627
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,435
I'd like to see
you come try it.

628
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,100
Yeah, sure. You'd love
to kill another cop today,
wouldn't you?

629
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,404
Only you.

630
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,202
They'll be coming on
strong now.

631
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,045
Why? Why? Why are cops
coming to kill us?

632
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,777
They need to kill him...

633
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,412
before he fingers them
in court.

634
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,421
They need to kill us, too,
now that we know it's them.

635
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,581
Oh, my God.

636
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,320
So, here's
what we're gonna do.

637
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,260
We're gonna take positions
all around the precinct...

638
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,766
and we're gonna hold them off
until dawn.

639
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:56,101
Iris, Alex, you know
how to use a firearm?

640
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,105
No. No.

641
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,972
Why don't you give me
one of them guns, Sergeant?

642
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,541
I'll help you fend off
the black hats.

643
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,323
Oh, shit.
Men are here.
Good.

644
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,699
What a fucking mess this is.

645
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,131
I know.

646
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:35,707
I'm looking at this
as a matter
of simple mathematics.

647
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,004
If we walk and those
eight people survive...

648
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,278
then 33 lives are destroyed.

649
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,018
The lives of my men
and their families.

650
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,458
People I'm responsible for.

651
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,626
People I...

652
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,599
People I love.

653
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,993
I don't see
any other way, Marcus.

654
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,232
The blood trail
leads right back to us.
We have no choice.

655
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,134
We go through this...

656
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,478
we are gonna
have to live with this
for the rest of our lives.

657
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,881
But you know something, Mike?

658
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,080
I could live with that...

659
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,152
more than I could live
with a cellmate.

660
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,125
Once we step outside...

661
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,589
those people are no longer
civilians or cops.

662
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,632
We got to put them all down.

663
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:38,669
Without pause, without regard.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

669
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,486
The complex problems
force me to concentrate...

670
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,961
neutralizing
any feelings of fear
I have at a given moment.

671
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,063
I hide behind its structure.

673
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,840
You're gonna be
all right, Doc.

674
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,769
No. You don't know that.
You don't know that.

675
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,037
You're so calm.

676
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,245
Thank you so much. Thanks.

677
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:37,058
You don't have
to do this.
Yes, I do. I do.

678
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,999
If I'm gonna die,
at least
I should die gracefully.

679
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,335
How are you
keeping it together?

680
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,173
I just think about living.

681
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:57,883
I want to live
as opposed to
I don't want to die.

682
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:05,784
That, and I keep telling
myself, everybody's
gonna make it this time.

683
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,590
We both know
what could happen
here, Sergeant.

684
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:28,080
Safety off.
Right.

685
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,212
All right. Wake up.

686
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,981
Wake up. Wake up.

687
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,657
BECK: All right, already.
Come on. Get up.

688
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:11,923
Come on.

689
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,153
Look...

690
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,926
here's the deal.

691
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,060
Those men that came in here,
they're still outside.

692
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:24,600
And I have no idea
how many there are...

693
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,608
or what
they're prepared to do.

694
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,871
Don't sweat it, man.
There's nothing you can do.

695
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,935
You can't stop
Bishop's people.

696
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,016
Go ahead, Sergeant. Tell them.

697
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,384
They're not Bishop's people.

698
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,355
They are police officers.
What?
Po-po popping each other?

699
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,424
That's the fuckingest
shit I ever seen.

700
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:49,088
This shit
ain't Smiley's fight, man.

701
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,098
Let Smiley go, man.
Let me go.

702
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,663
Shit, I totally
figured it out.

703
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,395
Assassination politics, right?

704
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,598
By your government-sanctioned
thugs abusing their authority
again, man?

705
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,907
Who's gonna save us
from your corrupt brethren,

You?

707

I'm gonna do my best
to protect you.
All right? All of you.

708
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,891
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I feel real safe, man.

00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:10,868
Oh, shit.

Get down!

Fuck.

00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,547
What happened
to the fucking window?

716
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,519
Cover the front.
All right.

717
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,124
I'll be right back!

Look out! Shoot him.

Shoot him again.
Shoot him!
He's not dead!

very fucking unsafe.

I'm scared to death.

like fucking live bait,

Please, don't leave us here.

for us. Come on, man.

[Door slamming open]

752
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:43,699
You fucker!

753
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:48,978
I can't believe you
make me your defendant,
you son of a bitch!

754
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,615
Make me set bail.

755
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,511
[Alex screaming]

756
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,021
You all right?

757
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,723
I feel better. I'm better.

758
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,903
Shit, I got mine, baby.
Oh, yeah.

759
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,651
Oh, yeah.

760
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:37,396
Come on, you motherfuckers.
Come on. Run.

761
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,263
[Exhaling]

762
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,837
Come on.

763
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,903
Come on. Yeah.
There you go, secretary.

764
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,266
Jesus Christ.

765
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:48,735
All right.
They're pulling back!

766
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:50,827
You all right?

767
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:51,929
He saved me.
She's fine.

768
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:55,840
Yo, there is nobody out there
in the front. Them
motherfuckers running scared.

769
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:59,175
All right.
I drove them back, baby.
I drove them back.

770
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,647
We're gonna have a red-raw
revolution on our hands, man.

771
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,116
All right. Good job.
Good job. Good job.

772
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,878
Maybe they'll leave
for fucking good now.

773
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,751
They're not going anywhere.

774
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,051
Put that goddamn weapon down.

775
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:14,117
Old man, you do not wanna
point that weapon at me.

776
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,990
That is not
a bright thing to do.

777
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:21,296
Put that goddamn weapon
down slowly, then back
away from it, all of you.

778
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,070
Jake, get their weapons.
Take their weapons.

779
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:27,733
Ain't this a bitch.
We saved your asses.
Now you wanna turn on us?

780
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:31,210
Yeah, well, thank you
for that, sweet cheeks.
Now, put your weapon down.

781
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:35,146
The problem is outside,
not inside.
Put the gun down, Jasper.

782
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,946
No. You know what the problem
is? That we criminals
got rights, baby.

783
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:41,044
That's right. We got
rights to be protected...

784
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,146
against assault
under any circumstances.
That's right.

785
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,783
And if you can't provide that,
well, fuck you, we will.

786
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:47,122
You're a fucking psycho.

787
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:50,721
Jesus Christ, Jake.
What? Are you gonna
trust these freaks?

788
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:54,799
The first chance they get to
blow our brains out, they'll
try to make a break for it.

789
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,098
They need us
as much as we need them.

790
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,765
We all gotta start
trusting each other,
right now...

791
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:02,332
if we're gonna make it
through this night.

792
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,438
Put the gun down, Jasper.

793
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:11,115
Put the goddamn gun down.

794
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,126
What?

795
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:40,578
Shit. I fucking knew it.
All right.

796
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,808
All right.

797
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,016
Now, let's
all introduce ourselves
to each other.

798
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,815
It's New Year's Eve.
Let's turn over
a new leaf.

799
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,724
All right. Well,
let's not all fucking
speak at once.

800
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:56,286
The name's Smiley.
And I'm a Libra, and...

801
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,597
I'll handle these jokers...

802
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:05,103
you handle your people,
maybe we get out of here
tonight.

803
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,472
He armed his prisoners.

804
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,181
It's a smart play.

805
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,776
Must be at least eight guns
in there now.

806
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:25,381
J ust a couple hours till
the sun's up. If we can't
breach, what do we do?

807
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:30,130
Get the AV-5 here.
Are you sure about that?

808
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,461
Yep. I'm not
taking any more chances.

809
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,601
It's gonna take a while
in this weather.

810
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,027
Marcus?

811
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:40,433
What the fuck do we do
if it doesn't arrive in time?

812
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,533
We'll have to think
of some other way
of ending this.

813
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,743
You either flirting with me
or clocking my game
'cause you don't trust me.

814
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:53,083
I don't like your beady little
eyes all over my goodies,
so turn the fuck away.

815
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:59,283
You're manipulative,
weak knees, and that
sexy copper complexion.

816
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:02,755
You're definitely
an Aries, baby.
You're pretty good.

817
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,863
Smiley thanks you.

818
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,598
You and me
got something in common,
you know that?

819
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,967
'Cause you coming down
off some shit, ain't you?

820
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,999
Don't be ashamed, man.
Don't be ashamed.

821
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,543
What's your poison?

822
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:21,171
Seconal to bring me down.
Adderall to bring me back up.

823
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:24,749
You gotta get up
to get down.
Oh, yeah, baby.
Oh, yeah.

824
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:28,186
All right. That's enough.
I mean, come on.
Let's pay attention.

825
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,553
I want a cigarette so bad.

826
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:33,083
Stupid New Year's resolutions.

827
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:39,323
Hey, gangster,
you make any resolutions?

828
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,468
What do you think, secretary?

829
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,300
Oh, my God. I can't
stop thinking about sex.

830
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:55,410
I mean, I usually
think about sex a lot,
but this is crazy.

831
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:58,076
Well, sex and death
are very closely related.

832
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:03,547
The Greeks called it
Eros and Thanatos,
love and death.

833
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,828
Or sex as a way
of nullifying
thoughts of dying.

834
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:13,164
What's your deal, gangster,
huh? You actually
been shot five times?

835
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,399
Six.

836
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,239
You really
pull a man's spine out?

837
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,375
It was an Adam's apple.

838
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:36,454
You ever get
into a tussle, secretary...

839
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,456
you grab a man by his throat.

840
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:45,263
Dig it? And then you squeeze.

841
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:51,663
I guarantee you he will drop.
He will not get up
for quite some time.

842
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,070
Oh, God. It's really quiet
out there now.

843
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:04,975
Yeah.

844
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,983
That's what worries me.

845
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:14,457
We're not gonna make it
till morning.

846
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,859
Marcus Duvall
will not allow it.

847
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,864
We've got eight people
covering six entry points.

848
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,900
If we work together,
all right,
we will make it.

849
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:23,460
Look at it this way.
That's me out there.

850
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,596
You think
I'd let you survive
until the morning?

851
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:29,609
We don't have
a lot of options here.
Well, we got to figure
something.

852
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:34,378
'Cause I'm not gonna
stay here all night,
waiting to get killed.

853
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,443
If you use the situation
to try and escape,
it's about me and you...

854
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,816
'cause when this is over,
you're going back to jail.

855
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,414
Relax, Sergeant.
Relax.

856
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:46,419
This ain't about me
and you. Not yet.

857
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:50,520
Our shit's
on pause, huh?
Yeah. Our shit's
on pause.

858
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:54,298
You saved my ass back there.

859
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:56,831
Why?

860
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:00,134
Everyone in here
is my responsibility.
It's my job.

861
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,704
That's noble. U nfortunately,
I don't share the sentiment.

862
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,405
I see a cop in jeopardy,
he's on his own...

863
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:12,676
unless it benefits me
to jump in for the save.

864
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,779
Listen. I don't
try to be anything I'm not.

865
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:18,825
That ain't gonna change.
I don't care what day it is.

866
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,024
You remember that, Sergeant.

867
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,120
Hey. Someone's coming.

868
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,599
Oh, God. It's Capra, Sarge!

869
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:40,137
BISHOP: You know this guy?
JAKE: He's a cop.
He works here.

870
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:41,703
They'll execute him.

871
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:44,843
Capra!

872
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,044
[Shushing]

873
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,361
Yeah. Drive. Drive!

874
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,286
IRIS: Oh, my God.
He's gonna make it.

875
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,162
BISHOP: He still has
to get by the sniper.

876
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:00,756
JAKE: Come on, Capra!

877
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:15,205
He's still moving.
They didn't get him yet.

878
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,316
What... Where are you going?

879
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:26,990
Come on. Come on.

880
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,662
Come on!
Come on, Capra!

881
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,062
Come on!

882
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,572
What the fuck is going on?

883
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,209
Who's fucking shooting
at us, Sarge?

884
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,945
Who the fuck
are all these people?

885
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:56,150
What are you
doing here, Capra?

886
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,284
What are you doing here?

887
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:01,054
It's New Year's Eve.
I knew you'd be here alone.

888
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,721
I came to have a drink
with Iris.

889
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:06,130
Oh, God. You picked
the wrong night to make
your move, baby, believe me.

890
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,395
You know,
that's really sweet.

891
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:12,734
That's really sweet, but,
unfortunately, I don't believe
a fucking word of it.

892
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:17,073
Put that goddamn weapon down,
you psycho. He works here.

893
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,670
I don't care that
he fucking works here, man.
He could be a plant.

894
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:24,013
No, Jasper. Put the gun down,
all right? Let's not
start that again, all right?

895
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:27,679
He comes here in the guise
of courting that lady.
It's a fucking ingenious plan.

896
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,085
They get one of their boys
in here...

897
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:31,591
and then take us out
one by one by one.
Come on. Tell them.

898
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,148
They shot at him.
Oh, yeah.

899
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,489
All right? They shot at him.
Yeah.

900
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,256
Oh, but they conveniently
fucking missed, didn't they?

901
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:37,990
The act is a fucking charade.

902
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,589
Come on. Tell them.
He's fucking right, Anna.

903
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:42,499
Isn't it
a fucking charade?
Do I have a gun?

904
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:44,661
Do I have a fucking gun?
I can't hurt you.

905
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,262
That's not fucking
good enough, rat-bitch.

906
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:49,365
Come on. J ust lock him up,
man, so he doesn't
do any damage. Come on.

907
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:52,139
Come on, Roenick.
Listen to me, man.
We're not locking
this man up.

908
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:54,908
Not in my precinct, all right?
I vouch for him.

909
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,543
Okay.

910
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,581
Okay, but I'm fucking sorry...

911
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,952
but your authority
has been super-fucking-seded.
You understand?

912
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:04,923
You're not in charge anymore.

913
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,457
Right, Bish? Bish, tell them.

914
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,254
He could be one of them, man,
and so fucking easily.

915
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,231
You don't think
we see right through you?

916
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,495
Can't fucking
believe that shit.

917
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:17,094
Comes in here
playing that game,
playing stupid.

918
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,831
You don't think we know?

919
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:21,465
Right, man? Let's do the math.

920
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:26,038
Come on. Let's put him away,
man, just play it safe,
you know?

921
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,273
Put it down.

922
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,541
No, no, no. Come on.
Come on, man. Come on.

923
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:34,178
J ust do the math. Come on.
Motherfucker comes in
like that, playing...

[Beck wheezing]

925
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:50,499
Come here. Sergeant Roenick
is in charge. U nderstand?

926
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:56,672
Yes.

927
01:08:58,467 --> 01:08:59,877
Let's go.

928
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,450
Only because I respect you.

929
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:11,283
But I still say this shit
is fucking illogical bullshit,
all right?

930
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:13,759
He may not
be who he says he is.
J ust mull that shit over.

931
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,057
Think it over.
Think it over, man.

932
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,494
Iris, look after Capra.
Fill him in
on what's going on.

933
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,098
All right, Capra?
J ust be cool, so no one else
here gets spooked.

934
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,974
Everybody else,
back to your positions.

935
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,412
Thank you.
Don't. That was
self-preservation.

936
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:45,584
The more men we have,
the better chance we stand.

937
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:49,286
Are you sure
you vouch for this man?
I do.

938
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:53,461
Come with me.

939
01:09:56,625 --> 01:10:00,868
You know, I hate to admit it,
but Smiley agrees with
what you said back there.

940
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:04,009
Smiley want a fucking medal?
Hear me out, man.

941
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:07,877
Look, we're out of our
shackles for what? The last
time in the next 15, 20 years?

942
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:10,314
All right, man.
Get to the point.
What do you want?

943
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:13,785
Listen to me, man.
Look out that window.
That's freedom, baby.

944
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,510
Get what I'm saying?

945
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:20,718
Look, maybe this New Year's
can bring something different
for us after all.

946
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,818
Beck like Smiley now.

947
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,097
Eight months ago
he loses his team
when a deal goes sour.

948
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,225
Problem with drugs
and alcohol
since the incident.

949
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:32,169
A burned-out cop.
Only a matter of time
before he drops his guard.

950
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:36,976
Watch the truck.
They'll eye it as a way out.

951
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,174
What's the word on the AV?

952
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:43,376
Storm's starting to let up,
so it shouldn't be long now.

953
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,011
Good.

954
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,760
Someone gets inside,
takes off, goes for help.

955
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:59,330
That's too obvious.
We'd need a distraction.

956
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:02,164
We also need the keys.
Your cop said
he dropped them in the snow.

957
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,135
ANNA: I could
hot-wire a car.

958
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,430
I thought
you never committed a crime
in your life?

959
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,600
I haven't.
Oh, yeah.

960
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:12,975
J ust picked up some shit
along the way.
Hold on.

961
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:16,347
How do we know she's not just
gonna drive out of here
and leave us all here to die?

962
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,476
Who the fuck are you,
Miss Fucking Little Skirt?

963
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,180
Shake that skinny ass
in somebody else's face.

964
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:26,157
Okay, Anna. No offense,
but I'll feel better
if somebody goes with you.

965
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:31,359
Maybe I should go.
I promise I'll make her
get some help. Scout's honor.

966
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:38,737
It's either me or Jasper.
Can't be.

967
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:42,441
We need your guns.
It's gotta be...
Me.

968
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:48,909
Me.
You?

969
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:57,516
Shoot.
Hey, I'll go. I'll do it.

970
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,627
What? It's the only thing
that makes sense, right?

971
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:04,289
Whatever.
Whatever the fuck ever.
Let's just do this. Come on.

972
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,661
Me and the doc.

973
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:08,627
Fine. Okay.

974
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:10,426
What?

975
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,038
It's the right move,
Sergeant. I know that.

976
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:16,371
All right.
I'm the doctor, right?

977
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,774
Right. You can
handle that?
Yes.

978
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,108
You can?
I don't know.
I don't know.

979
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,573
But I have
to try, okay?
No. No.

980
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,346
Please. I have to go.

981
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,549
I have to do it.

982
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,252
Shit!

983
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:43,860
Hey!

984
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:48,265
Those two skels
are bugging out, just like
I told you they would.

985
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:51,367
They torched the bus
for a diversion, I guess.

986
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,438
Come on!

987
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:03,080
Jesus. They're gonna
get themselves killed.
They're dead already.

988
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,225
We can use this.

989
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,369
Very smart.

990
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:20,133
They knew we'd expect them
to make for the car.

991
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,736
Freedom, baby. We did it.
Yeah. I told you.

992
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,744
Happy New Year.
Now, how are we gonna
get the fuck out of here?

993
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:29,373
Visual on two men. No shot.

994
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,783
Moving to a better vantage.

995
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:42,653
Hey.

996
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,595

997
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:49,066
Yeah.

Where'd they hit you, man?

1000
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,144
On my shoulder.

1001
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:06,708
Let's go. Come on.
Let's haul ass now.
Okay. Okay!

01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,151
Go.
You go.

1003
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,037
All right. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

1004
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,940
This was not the plan, man.
This was your idea.

Come on.
We're so fucking close.

What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do, man?

1011
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:56,024
Don't make me
go at this alone.

1012
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:58,332
Target two locked.

but no shot.

No.
Yeah.

to do, Sarge?

Bishop's men were responsible
for all this, remember?

1050
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:12,319
Let's get this thing done.

1051
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,666
Time's up, Sergeant.

1052
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:33,604
Last stand.

1053
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,015
Your gun would be appreciated.

1054
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:45,947
Why did I let her go?

1055
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:53,526
I know a lot
about dying, Sergeant.

1056
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,433
There are two ways
you can handle it.

1057
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:01,033
With the self-pity
or without it.

1058
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:04,006
Fuck you.
Get out of my office.

1059
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,607
I see you've made
your decision.

1060
01:20:58,386 --> 01:20:59,830
Sun's almost up.

1061
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:02,391
Whatever Duvall's gonna do,
he's gonna do now.

1062
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,960
We need to get ready,
or we'll be trapped.

1063
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:06,936
Who the fuck asked you?

1064
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:10,642
You know, I've had
all the shit I'm gonna
take from you, old man.

1065
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:14,203
Hey, fuck you, dealer.
No.

1066
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,111
Fuck with me.

1067
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:19,648
I should've
fucked with you...
Enough!

1068
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,217
Bishop's right.

1069
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:26,591
Jasper, you just
watch the front here.
Iris, the cell block.

1070
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:30,659
Capra, you're on.
Take the back stairs.

1071
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:34,527
Bishop and I'll roam,
covering all
the other entrances.

1072
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:36,253
Hey.

1073
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:42,561
What were you doing
by the back door?
What were you doing?

1074
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:43,966
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1075
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:48,439
I saw you. What did you
tell them? Why didn't you
let them inside?

1076
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,236
What's the plan?

1077
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:56,179
What's going on?
You were wrong.
He's working for Duvall.

1078
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:59,478
He removed the handcuffs
from the back door.

1079
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:03,447
What's the plan? Answer me!

1080
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:04,849
Fuck!

1081
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,218
I'm a fucking police officer.
I don't have to
fucking answer you.

1082
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,087
[Groaning]

1083
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:14,155
What's the plan, officer?

1084
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:18,660
Oh.

1085
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:22,567
So it's about you and me now,
huh, Sergeant?

1086
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,773
It's not about me
and you. Not yet.

1087
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,878
What were you doing
by the back door, Capra?

1088
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,177
It wasn't me, Jake.

1089
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:32,274
What's the plan?
I wasn't there.

1090
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,979
We let him live once.
He almost got us killed.

1091
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,123
We let him live twice,
we deserve to die.

1092
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:43,929
You and I are friends, Jake.
You gonna do this to me?

1093
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:48,027
What is the plan?
There is no fucking plan!

1094
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:49,898
[Helicopter whirring]
Don't make me
fucking kill you.

1095
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:53,234
What the fuck
are you doing to him?
Listen. They're coming!

1096
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:58,736
<i>AV-5 getting into position.</i>
<i>Ten seconds to target.</i>

1097
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:01,608
[Helicopter whirring]

1098
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:25,132
What the fuck
are they doing up there?
What do you think?

1099
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:42,319
Save your ammo.

1100
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,288
We don't know where they are.

1101
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:47,348
We need to make
a move outside.

1102
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:52,387
That's what
they want us to do.
Yeah. They'll pick us off,
one by one.

1103
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:58,164
Jake, I found a way out.
Down in the basement.

1104
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:00,836
All right, Iris, Capra.

1105
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:11,679
All right. Go.

1106
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:15,046
Bishop, I need you.

1107
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:23,893
Come on.

1108
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:06,265
It's an old sewer tunnel.
Why didn't you
mention it before?

1109
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:09,632
I didn't think of it.
We've been a little bit busy.

1110
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,200
I don't even know
where it goes.

1111
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:16,435
Of course, we can
always stay here.

1112
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:20,112
JAKE: It doesn't matter.
Good job, Jasper.

1113
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:34,088
Okay. We need to move.
The fire department
will be here soon.

1114
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:58,578
There it is.

1115
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:26,511
All right. It's all clear.
Everybody up.

1116
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,687
Come on, Jasper.

1117
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,129
Thanks.

1118
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:52,933
Son of a bitch!
Jake!
All right. Now...

1119
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,775
me and the secretary are
going bye-bye. You don't
follow, she don't get hurt.

1120
01:28:56,831 --> 01:29:00,506
You lower your weapons,
gentlemen, we can
end this on a happy note.

1121
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:07,443
My apologies, secretary.

1122
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,317
Apology not fucking accepted.

1123
01:29:09,377 --> 01:29:12,551
Hold it right there.
Drop your fucking weapons
right now.

1124
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,391
Down, motherfucker! Down!

1125
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:15,859
Damn it!

1126
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:18,793
Get down!

1127
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:26,871
How the hell
did they find us?

1128
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:50,022
Oh, my God. It was Jasper
at the back door. You
set us up, you motherfucker!

1129
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:55,060
You just killed us, Jasper.
No, fuck you, Jake!

1130
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:56,596
God damn it! I told you...

1131
01:29:56,657 --> 01:30:00,127
"J ust let them
have the son of a bitch.
Nobody else gets hurt."

1132
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:03,473
'Cause I ain't dying
for that piece of shit.

1133
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:09,508
Or for you either, Jake.

1134
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:12,778
I thought you were a cop.

1135
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:18,818
Go in the truck, Jas.
You don't need to see this.

1136
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,995
Bishop, you
should've taken that deal.

1137
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:37,674
These men aren't cops,
Sergeant. They're criminals.

1138
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:40,944
They're killers, just like me.
Ain't that right, old man?

1139
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,744
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

1140
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:47,809
You're goddamn right,
you son of a bitch!

1141
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,978
Not with your weapon.

1142
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:03,491
Give me a clean piece.
God damn it!
Give me a clean piece!

1143
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:04,900
Close your eyes.

1144
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:07,804
Let him finish it.

1145
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,379
Shit! Get down.

1146
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:22,717
The truck! The truck!
The truck!

1147
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:33,756
Go.

1148
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:46,137
Get them.

1149
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:55,537
You breathing? Good. Okay.

1150
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:04,111
Oh, fuck. J ust act
like you're dead, okay?

1151
01:33:36,077 --> 01:33:37,317
[Twig snapping]

1152
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:08,782
Motherfucker!

1153
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,150
Fuck you.

1154
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,827
You fucking bitch!

1155
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:50,319
Hello, Sergeant.

1156
01:35:51,946 --> 01:35:53,789
What the hell
are you still doing here?

1157
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:56,126
Marcus Duvall still lives.

1158
01:35:57,251 --> 01:35:59,162
For me, this is unacceptable.

1159
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:02,566
So our shit's back on pause.
Is that it?

1160
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:08,000
Yeah.

1161
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:13,943
We have a problem.

1162
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:18,180
Duvall and his men can see us.
We can't see them.

1163
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:25,287
I'll draw their fire.

1164
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:29,058
Their muzzle flashes'll
give away their position.

1165
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:32,831
Don't miss, Bishop.

1166
01:36:34,021 --> 01:36:35,500
Run fast, Sergeant.

1167
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,828
Call Roenick.
Who's Roenick?

1168
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:19,309
H urts like a bitch,
doesn't it?

1169
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,204
Call Roenick.
Tell him I'm dead.

1170
01:37:22,736 --> 01:37:26,775
You know me, Marcus.
I cannot tell a lie.

1171
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:31,784
Look at you.

1172
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:36,787
When I first approached you
10 years ago, you couldn't
look me in the eye.

1173
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:40,594
One of them nervous,
God-fearing types.

1174
01:37:41,288 --> 01:37:43,791
Now you put a bullet in me,
no hesitation.

1175
01:37:44,758 --> 01:37:47,738
You're quite the changed man
this New Year's, Marcus.

1176
01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:51,239
Now, for the last
fucking time, call him.

1177
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:52,777
He doesn't have to.

1178
01:37:53,968 --> 01:37:55,572
Drop your weapon.

1179
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:10,355
What are you
waiting for?
Shut up!

1180
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:13,727
Put the gun down, Duvall.
What are you gonna do?
Shoot me?

1181
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:16,831
Arrest me?
You gonna kill a cop?

1182
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,731
There's only one cop here.

1183
01:38:19,126 --> 01:38:22,334
Now put the goddamn gun down.
You're caught.

1184
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:24,739
How many more people
are you gonna kill tonight?

1185
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:26,470
As many as it takes.

1186
01:38:28,402 --> 01:38:30,142
You make me fucking sick.

1187
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:37,177
Fuck!

1188
01:38:48,856 --> 01:38:50,130
[Jake groaning]

1189
01:39:08,475 --> 01:39:09,476
[Muttering disagreement]

1190
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:19,095
So it's about that time, huh?

1191
01:39:22,823 --> 01:39:24,529
Looks that way, don't it?

1192
01:39:27,761 --> 01:39:28,762
Yeah.

1193
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:30,705
Well, thanks.

1194
01:39:31,932 --> 01:39:35,277
For what?
You didn't call my name.

1195
01:39:36,603 --> 01:39:39,913
That was self-preservation,
Sergeant, and it worked.

1196
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:43,477
I told you.
I'm not gonna change.

1197
01:39:43,544 --> 01:39:47,583
You try to follow me,
you'll find out
just how true that is.

1198
01:39:48,349 --> 01:39:50,294
You're not gonna get very far.

1199
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:51,958
I'll manage.

1200
01:39:55,356 --> 01:39:56,425
Well...

1201
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:00,033
you take care
of yourself, Sergeant.

1202
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:02,804
I will find you.

1203
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:09,740
No other cop. J ust me.

1204
01:40:19,313 --> 01:40:20,382
Jesus.

1205
01:40:23,751 --> 01:40:24,957
IRIS: Sarge?

1206
01:40:31,892 --> 01:40:34,963
Sarge? Sergeant.

1207
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:37,668
Yeah, Iris.
Oh, Christ. Look at you.

1208
01:40:37,731 --> 01:40:40,609
It's okay. I told
these firemen what's up.
They're not leaving us alone.

1209
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:43,409
Not for a second. Okay?
All right. Help me up.

1210
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:44,673
[Grunting]

1211
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:50,921
We have some questions
for you, Sergeant.

1212
01:40:50,978 --> 01:40:54,015
Yeah, well, I'd like
to get this wound
looked at first.

1213
01:40:54,915 --> 01:40:56,553
Anybody else out there?

1214
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:02,892
No, man. There's nobody else.
J ust me and them.

1215
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:07,699
Let me get you
on a stretcher.
No. No, man. It's all right.

1216
01:41:07,761 --> 01:41:09,467
I'm walking out of here.

1217
01:41:09,863 --> 01:41:12,036
[Ambulance sirens wailing]

1218
01:41:15,936 --> 01:41:19,474
So do you think
we have to show up
at the new precinct tomorrow?

1219
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:22,615
Shit. This is
fucking tempting.

1220
01:41:22,676 --> 01:41:24,951
No. Don't break
your resolution, huh?

1221
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:28,226
Give me one.
I didn't make that promise.

1222
01:41:32,152 --> 01:41:35,360
You know, Sarge, I didn't
even recognize you tonight.

1223
01:41:36,223 --> 01:41:40,000
You were like
a whole different bad ass,
motherfucker back there, huh?

1224
01:41:40,794 --> 01:41:42,500
You think so?
Yeah.

1225
01:41:42,563 --> 01:41:44,098
Well, get used to it.

1226
01:41:45,966 --> 01:41:47,570
Happy New Year, Sarge.

2
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,834
Corner of Wiltern and Wetherly.

3
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:30,795
Tumbler messed up.

4
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:33,965
Said the Porsche would be
at the corner of Wiltern and Wetherly.

5
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,843
- Right there.
- You're bullshittin' me, right?

6
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:40,638
- 9024 Wiltern?
- What? That?

7
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,974
I gotta get my tool.

8
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:46,269
- Kip!
- He ain't bullshittin'.

9
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:52,358
Kip! Man, that's not a tool.
That's a damn brick.

10
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,901
Kip, man, we gonna use a brick, man,

11
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:57,947
we might as well call prison
and make reservations. Aw, come on.

12
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,578
- Oh...
- Get the number.

13
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:08,666
42850.

14
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,418
Hurry up, man.

15
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,213
Man, let's go!

16
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,343
Let's get the hell outta here.

17
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:24,724
OK, Billy Badass. You got us in here, now
tell me how the hell we gonna get out.

18
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:27,560
Oh, no, I know you ain't gonna do
what I think you're gonna do.

19
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,770
Oh, man!

20
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,564
Come on!

21
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,817
- This ain't The Dukes of Hazzard.
- Come on!

22
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,447
Aaaaaagh!

23
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,836
Yo, so check out my new move.
I call it "the stranger."

24
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:59,634
What I do is, I sit on my hand for, like,
15, 20 minutes, until it goes numb.

25
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:03,846
No feeling at all.
And then... I rub one out.

26
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,765
"The stranger," huh?

27
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:10,603
It's like a little boy's nursery school
I've come upon here.

28
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,814
Where are they?

29
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:18,778
Hey!

30
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:22,657
- Leave those people alone, man.
- Oh, my God. Sweetie, you're so talented.

31
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,660
- Stolen car. Stolen car.
- I know. I know.

32
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,870
Hey, I love ya.

33
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,668
Man, we going to jail, man!

34
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:36,754
Come on!

35
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,346
...hands behind your back.
You have the right to remain silent.

36
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,391
Hey, watch it!

37
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:53,855
We have a silver Porsche,
estimated speed 80 miles per hour,

38
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:58,025
- heading west on Wilshire Boulevard.
- Yeah.

39
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,278
This is Air One.
We have a visual of the suspect,

40
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:02,196
southbound on Vincent Thomas Bridge.

41
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:09,787
- Something wrong, Tumbler?
- Yeah, I'm missing Jerry Springer.

42
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:17,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

43
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,220
That's right, that's
right, that's right!

44
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:33,394
- Ha-ha! What's up, old man?
- She'll go zero to 60 in 5.2 seconds.

45
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,980
Believe me, I can vouch for that.

46
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,401
Ground units, be advised, suspects last
seen entering south side of warehouse.

47
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,821
13 down, 37 to go.

48
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,747
- What the hell is that?
- What is that, man?

49
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,457
Now you've gone and done it, Raines.

50
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,959
Tumbler! Get the board
and get the lights!

51
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,921
- I got it!
- This is bullshit!

52
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,547
- It's not comin' off!
- Keys! Get the keys!

53
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,675
- I got 'em, I got 'em!
- Come on, everybody, let's go! Hurry up!

54
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,677
- I got it!
- Let's go!

55
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,555
Toby. get it!
Let's go, boys!

56
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:12,308
Come on, come on, come on!
I got the light! I got the light!

57
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,936
Go, 90. go!
Let's go!

58
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,856
Shit!

59
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:36,415
VIN number on that? Got it.

60
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,380
What do we got?

61
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,884
All gone. We didn't get a single one of 'em,
and we are talkin' about professionals.

62
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:51,389
No visible damage to locking mechanisms,
steering columns or ignitions,

63
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:54,684
and, as you can see,
these are not Honda Civics.

64
00:07:54,684 --> 00:08:01,565
This is one of three brand-new Mercedes -
a car they say is unstealable.

65
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,943
Yeah, unless you get
the laser-cut transponder key

66
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:06,696
sent directly to the US dealer
from Hamburg.

67
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,614
They got somebody
working on the inside.

68
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:11,701
Let's find out which dealership sold 'em,
serviced 'em, et cetera, et cetera.

69
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,328
Yeah, I'll get on it.

70
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,582
- Mr. Drycoff?
- Yeah?

71
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,876
Let's impound these
cars for one month.

72
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:24,296
I don't give a damn
if they belong to Torn Cruise.

73
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,490
Control.

74
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,908
Vision.

75
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,161
Determination.

76
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:57,663
These are the three
fundamental components

77
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,458
of the new-generation
race-car driver.

78
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,794
Speed is a by-product. Goin' fast.

79
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:08,841
But remember - the car is you.
You are the car.

80
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,928
OK? Let's ride!

81
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:21,228
Billy, you just shaved one second
off your lap time!

82
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:38,037
Tommy, I don't know what that was,
but it wasn't driving.

83
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,667
<i>Go get 'em!</i>

84
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,969
Well, well, well.

85
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:58,265
What do you pay your pit crews with?
Oreos and Gummi Bears?

86
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,937
I folded, Atley. You know that.
What are you doing here?

87
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,272
- Is there some place we can talk?
- About what?

88
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,775
About your brother
and the deep shit he's in.

89
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:11,904
Frank. Would you watch the kids
for a minute?

90
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,666
- Tell me about Kip.
- He took a job and he fumbled it.

91
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:27,253
Now he's jammed up.
He's jammed up bad.

92
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:32,299
- What kind of job?
- A boost. A big boost.

93
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,260
A boost.

94
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,057
What's Kip doin' on a boost?

95
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:45,688
Oh, you're shittin' me, man. Kip's become
quite the little crew runner since you left.

96
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,651
- You don't talk to your ma?
- She neglected to mention it.

97
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:55,781
Listen, I need somethin'.
I need something cold to drink.

98
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:59,160
I thought we were goin'
someplace to talk.

99
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:09,795
- Who was the job for?
- A new guy named Raymond Calitri.

100
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:15,217
They call him the Carpenter. He's runnin'
all the dark ponies down there now.

101
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:19,346
He's a full-on devil-came-down-
to-Long-Beach trip.

102
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:23,517
He's bad.
He's real bad.

103
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:27,271
And this Calitri
is the one who's after my brother?

104
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,273
Like stains on a mattress.

105
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,819
And you should know I work for him.

106
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:41,660
There weren't a lot of opportunities
for retired car thieves on the gimp.

107
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,663
He put me to work.

108
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:50,211
But I gotta tell you, Memphis, this guy,
he scares the shit out of even me.

109
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:15,110
What are you doing, man?

110
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,196
Stop!

111
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,782
Stop!

112
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:27,331
Atley Jackson.

113
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,832
Right.

114
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:32,878
- They have Kip.
- Take me there.

115
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,702
Raymond Calitri, Memphis Raines.

116
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:10,124
I try to learn your ways,
understand your obsessions.

117
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:14,003
But this baseball,
it's so bleedin' boring. Isn't?

118
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,130
Where's my brother?

119
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,385
Memphis Raines.
Your legend precedes you.

120
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,971
Atley tells me you're the best.

121
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:28,183
After you left, auto theft
in the South Bay area went down 47%.

122
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,394
Where's my brother?

123
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:36,483
I'm proud of these. Straddle chair
from the Arts and Crafts period.

124
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:40,321
Mahogany table with cloud-lift pattern,
black walnut wine table.

125
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:44,325
Metal's cold, ugly.
Wood's warm, clean.

126
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:47,161
Provided by nature.

127
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:52,041
To see a piece of furniture take shape,
it's like watching a child grow.

128
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,752
I asked you a question.

129
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:58,547
They threw us out England,
threw us out of France, but here we are.

130
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,090
Flourishing, really,

131
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,887
except for the minor inconvenience of
despising everything about your country.

132
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,973
On this list, you'll find 50 cars.
Five-zero.

133
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,977
I need all 50 delivered
to Long Beach Harbor, pier 14,

134
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,856
by 8am four days from now.
I'm paying $200,000.

135
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,359
I'm not interested.
I'm just here for my brother.

136
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:21,987
Your Kip came to me.
He had street cred.

137
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,990
The brother of the notorious
Memphis Raines.

138
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,869
So two weeks ago I hired him
and advanced him $10,000.

139
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:33,916
Atley told me. If it's about the advance,
I can understand your anger.

140
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:39,380
A debt has to be settled.
Ten grand, from me to you.

141
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,716
- I wish it was that easy.
- I don't see the complication.

142
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,969
I have four days to deliver 50 cars,
and I have no cars.

143
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:50,516
- Well, that's another problem.
- It is another problem, isn't it?

144
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:54,353
It's about me delivering 50 top-end cars
because I said I would,

145
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:57,773
because if I don't, my South American
friend goes somewhere else from now on.

146
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,942
And that's not good.
It's a humiliation.

147
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,069
Because I'm the arsehole
who said I could deliver.

148
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:06,031
Am I an arsehole?
Do I look like an arsehole?

149
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,658
Yeah.

150
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:13,455
- I need that paper satisfying.
- I'm retired.

151
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:16,708
Now, where the hell is my brother?

152
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,715
I made this as well.

153
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,802
My first one.

154
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:46,321
It takes 80,000 pounds of pressure
to crush a car.

155
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,834
Kip?

156
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,044
- Who's that?
- Memphis.

157
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,838
- Oh, shit.
- You OK?

158
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,014
- Shut it off!
- Turn it off!

159
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,224
You've got 30 seconds
to consider your options.

160
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,142
Shut it off!

161
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:18,854
One. You kill me, they kill you,
your brother dies anyway.

162
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:23,108
Two. You lie, you accept the job,
you take your brother, you run.

163
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,777
I hunt you down, I kill you,
I kill your brother

164
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:29,198
and I kill your mother
for the aggravation you've caused me.

165
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,994
Three. You accept the deal, you steal
some cars, you make some money

166
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,038
and you be a big brother.

167
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,257
- Memphis!
- 8am, Friday morning.

168
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:50,219
The cars are on the boat,
or your brother's in the coffin.

169
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,805
Get me out of here!
Somebody get me out of here!

170
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,191
Listen, you really
don't have to make me anything.

171
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:08,529
Oh, hey, you come down here,
you save my ass. It's the least I can do.

172
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:15,577
Hey, I heard you were, uh, pumping gas
some place up north, or something, right?

173
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,247
- Yeah, working with kids.
- Oh, yeah.

174
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,752
First place.

175
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,754
I remember this.

176
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,592
Oh, yeah. That was a...
that was a long time ago.

177
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,606
- What did you put in it?
- I don't know.

178
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,072
It's good.

179
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:05,210
- Does Mom know about any of this?
- No, she doesn't, and...

180
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,089
I don't think she should.
You know, she works really hard, and...

181
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:12,259
She doesn't need to know
about any of this stuff.

182
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,013
Look, you know,
I got everything under control.

183
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:18,432
Kitchen's on fire.

184
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,605
Uh... Man!

185
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,656
Hey, Memphis.

186
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,202
It's good to see you.

187
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,667
Haul the cartons over there!

188
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,253
- Hey, Fuzzy.
- Aw, shit. What are you doing here?

189
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:52,591
- I told you I don't know anything.
- Yeah, but you're a liar.

190
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:55,135
- You're gonna get me fired, man.
- Fired? That's not good.

191
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,597
- You're on parole, right?
- Fuzzy. Hey.

192
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:03,268
Nobody wants to get you fired.
We just need this information, is all.

193
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,646
Two weeks ago, a call came in
for a lot of top-end cars.

194
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:08,732
- And who made that call?
- I don't have a clue.

195
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,610
- OK, we should go talk to your boss.
- Shh!

196
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,821
The delivery date.
I know the delivery date.

197
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,200
- And when is that?
- Thursday, Friday, end of the week.

198
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,703
Well, you get me a name
within 48 hours, or we'll be back.

199
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,414
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Thank you.

200
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:33,507
- I'm looking for Helen Raines.
- Helen, some guy is here for you.

201
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,759
What guy?
What's he look like?

202
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,096
Like a firecracker.
Like your son.

203
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,600
- You look so good.
- Thank you, Mom.

204
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,521
- I got a spring bouquet.
- What are you doing here?

205
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:53,402
Well, Atley Jackson came to see me.
He told me something about Kip.

206
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,737
Can I help you with one of these?

207
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,498
Tell Castlebeck he's not gonna believe
who just walked into the Quality Cafe.

208
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,626
I can't say I'm surprised.

209
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:14,256
All his life he looked up to you,
tried to be you.

210
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,425
Guess now he is.

211
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:19,594
So why is this happening?
I send you guys money.

212
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:23,348
He met some people, and he changed.

213
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:28,854
He lost that... that sweetness.
You know?

214
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,816
OK.

215
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,902
Tell me.
How deep in is he?

216
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,155
Deep.

217
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,824
Can you get him out?

218
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,911
It means doing things.

219
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,875
Things I told you
I'd never do again.

220
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,461
Do what it takes, Randall.

221
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,768
- When did you get into town, Raines?
- Last night.

222
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,812
- Last night? What for?
- I thought I'd catch a Lakers game.

223
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:14,900
Heard we got Shaquille.
You guys wanna go?

224
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,779
- Guess not.
- Randall, Randall, Randall. Come here.

225
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:22,824
I get this call from this uniform,
you know. Axton.

226
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,701
Very nice man.
Remembers everything.

227
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,204
This man calls me up, says,
"Guess who's back in town."

228
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,456
I say, "Who?"
He says, "Randall Raines."

229
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,500
I say, "Randall Raines the car thief?"
He says, "Yeah."

230
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,918
I say, "impossible."
He says, "No, he's back."

231
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:37,172
I say, "No, he's not." He says, "Yes, I will
bet you $200 I just saw Randall Raines."

232
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:41,593
- You guys said a lot. Look, Detective...
- No, whoa, whoa.

233
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,845
What's really, really
ironic about this -

234
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:47,682
two nights ago, we snare these 13
fresh stolens waiting for export, right?

235
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:52,312
And at the time I'm thinking,
"This feels like Randall Raines."

236
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,398
Now, it didn't have
your panache, your ﬂash,

237
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:58,568
but it just felt like Randall Raines.

238
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,362
And now here you are.

239
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:04,282
Look, I don't know what you boys are
looking for, but I just got back. OK?

240
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,743
It was a family emergency.
Now, that's the truth.

241
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:10,413
"Family emergency." Yeah, I got
a family emergency, too, Randall.

242
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:14,417
I gotta go tell my woman
that I just lost $200 on a stupid deal.

243
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:17,128
- Mm, she's mean.
- What?

244
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:21,341
She can be mean.
It's not so...

245
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,969
Come here.
Come here, Randall.

246
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:27,806
And take those glasses off, Randall,
please. Do me a favor.

247
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:32,769
Six years ago you make
a real smart move, you know.

248
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:36,273
You retire from a life that's gonna get
you busted or killed, or maybe even both.

249
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,776
And I'm thinkin' that not putting
you away when I had a chance

250
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:44,823
is like this big bug up the ass of this
real impressive career that I've had.

251
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:51,204
Oh, yeah, well, without disappointment,
you can't appreciate victory.

252
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,500
- Eleanor tell you that?
- Well, now, that's hittin' below the belt.

253
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,586
Yeah, all right, let me tell you
about "below the belt," Randall.

254
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:59,880
I tell you what - from here on out,
if you walk across the street

255
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,591
outside of a crosswalk,
if you roll through a stop sign,

256
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:06,636
if you use an aerosol can
in a manner other than directed...

257
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:11,766
I mean, I don't care. You make one slip,
and I will put you away for good.

258
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,394
- OK.
- By the time you get out, asshole,

259
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,354
there won't even be cars.

260
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:21,443
We'll all be cruisin' around in,
you know, little spaceships.

261
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,486
That's gonna suck.

262
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,699
Who's Eleanor?

263
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,826
It's a damn car.

264
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,454
And don't ever talk about my wife.

265
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,130
Excuse me.
Do you know where Otto is?

266
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,799
He's in the back, in the paint shop.

267
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:59,189
Is that you?
It's about time you came to see me.

268
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:02,067
- I missed you.
- Good to see you!

269
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,529
- You look great.
- It's good to see you.

270
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,823
- You remember my Junie?
- Hey, Junie. How are you?

271
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:11,493
- We're doing good, thank you.
- Good. Good.

272
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:16,122
- You look happy.
- Well, I am happy. I really am.

273
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,042
- So what happened here?
- What do you mean?

274
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:24,047
Well, it's nice. But the chop shop,
the stripped cars, my education...

275
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:27,092
What happened?
Hey.

276
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:31,054
Old age happened. That's what happened.
Got tired of killin' 'em.

277
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:33,890
You know, I woke up
one morning and thought:

278
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,518
"I'm no longer a destroyer.
I am a means of resurrection."

279
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:41,439
Now we restore, we revive. Come here.
Remember when we used to do this?

280
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,192
- What?
- You know. Come here. OK.

281
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:51,825
The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona.
Le Mans 1971.

282
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,702
- Quad cam.
- That's a V-12.

283
00:24:53,702 --> 00:25:00,667
V-12! Right, right, right, right!
Here it peaks... at 5500 RPM!

284
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,086
What do you know about
Raymond Calitri?

285
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,171
- Who?
- Raymond Calitri.

286
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,843
Uh, excuse us, sweetness.
I'll be right back.

287
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:12,595
- We can talk right here.
- No, no, no, no. It's all right.

288
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,764
Raymond Calitri.

289
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:19,644
He's a jackal tearing at the soft belly
of our... of our fair town.

290
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,524
And he's an asshole to boot,
so be careful.

291
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,402
I heard about Kip.

292
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,947
- Are you considering a comeback tour?
- Do you think it can be done?

293
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:34,826
Don't do this to me, OK? Please.

294
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,953
Please. Not now.

295
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,707
Oh, man.

296
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:49,007
- How many cars?
- 50.

297
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,552
- How many days?
- Three.

298
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,680
How many in your crew?

299
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,059
One, but I came here hoping
to negotiate for a second.

300
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:03,897
No way. It can't be done. I mean, you need
time to prep, time to shop. You know that.

301
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,941
It has to be.
They're gonna kill him.

302
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,655
Man.

303
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,917
It was a mistake to come here.

304
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:29,089
You have a great life now.
I don't wanna upset that.

305
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:36,054
Uh, wait a minute.
Whoa. Hold on.

306
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,723
Look around you.

307
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:43,228
These days I'm all
about second chances.

308
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:47,816
So let's make a few phone calls
and we'll go from there, OK?

309
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,442
OK.

310
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,905
Don't look at me.
Look at the people next to you!

311
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:56,324
Turn the wheel!

312
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,243
Pull over!
Pull it the hell over!

313
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:03,123
- Asshole!
- Learn how to drive!

314
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,211
Don't touch nothin'. Just...

315
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,130
No!

316
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:15,093
You can't negotiate turns,
you can't signal properly,

317
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:20,682
you can't maintain speed, you can't
parallel park. Hell, you can't drive, honey.

318
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,101
Shit, I can't swim.
I know I can't.

319
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,980
So you know what I do?
I stay my black ass out the pool!

320
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,692
All right, now, just...

321
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,654
Just... Can you...

322
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,198
Hello?

323
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:40,201
Memphis!
Hey, how are you?

324
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,163
Sure, sure. When?

325
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,165
OK.

326
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,667
All right, man.
Thanks a lot.

327
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,254
Donny.

328
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:55,633
Just take it around the block
a couple of times, OK? All right.

329
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:05,018
Hello, I'm calling for Frankie Fish.

330
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:08,021
Frank's dead, man.
Yeah, he got scragged.

331
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,814
I'm sorry.

332
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,317
Uh, yeah, I'm looking
for Henry Santoro.

333
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,861
He went down to Florida
with that asshole Frankie Fish.

334
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:16,196
You see him,
you tell him I want my money.

335
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,697
I didn't mess with your money.

336
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,699
Yes, ma'am.
I'm looking for Dan and Mikey.

337
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,243
Both of 'em up to Chino,
doin' a nickel apiece.

338
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,245
No, I'm not so sure
I wanna tell you who this is.

339
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,955
Yeah, try it, asshole.

340
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:28,750
You sound, uh, very busy right now.

341
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,877
You sound very, very busy.

342
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:34,088
Whoo.

343
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:38,593
- There's only two names left.
- Yeah? I wanna see who you got.

344
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:41,763
Sphinx...
Those two? No way.

345
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:45,767
- There's no one else.
- Are you sure?

346
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,188
- You tell him.
- Listen, why should I be...

347
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:51,856
You were the one
who answered the phone, right?

348
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:52,982
Fine!

349
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,443
But how's a guy who can't speak
gonna take a phone call?

350
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,320
You've got a call!

351
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:16,714
Sphinx, is that you?

352
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:18,883
Press a button if it's you.

353
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:30,103
- Sway, you set up this brake job?
- Yeah.

354
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:33,773
He warped all four rotors. He must've been
riding those brakes like an old lady.

355
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:37,193
- That's nice.
- Sounds like the left bank's running lean.

356
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,582
The service department's over there.

357
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:55,211
- Can I talk to you?
- Talk to me? Yeah, sure. Talk.

358
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:59,215
- Well, thing of it is, I came back because...
- Do you know what time it is?

359
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:03,052
It's 5:30.
I came back because...

360
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:06,180
- I gotta go. I'm late for work.
- Here.

361
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:13,604
- You're at work.
- I got two jobs.

362
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:19,277
I have discovered that you have to
work twice as hard when it's honest.

363
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,703
- Hey, Sway, can I get another shot?
- Yeah.

364
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:34,000
- You're still looking amazing.
- While you look like a bible salesman.

365
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,252
You're healed.

366
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:39,672
- Can we improvise a little bit?
- Sure. What do you have in mind?

367
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,216
Do you wanna get a little crazy?
There's a Cutlass 4-4-2 in the back.

368
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:46,095
We can strip down and shine the hood.
What do you say?

369
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:49,223
- Uh, that's not what I had in mind.
- No?

370
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:52,894
It's about my brother.

371
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,395
- Kip's in trouble.
- In trouble?

372
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:57,273
- He took a boost, and he blew it.
- Shit.

373
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,820
- And you got some Italians?
- Five or six.

374
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,825
- Right.
- It's 50 ladies in 24 hours, $200,000.

375
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:10,828
Well, I've cleaned up.

376
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,293
I understand. I hate to even
come here and ask you...

377
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,379
- Sway, can I get that drink now, please?
- Yes.

378
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:23,674
And I had to ask a few of the others,
too, and I feel bad about it, but...

379
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,218
But you had no choice.
You had to come here. Yeah.

380
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,928
Pretty much.

381
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:30,014
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

382
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:36,729
I'd love to help Kip,
but I'm not into the life anymore.

383
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:42,026
- Well, that's a good thing.
- Yeah.

384
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:46,697
- I'm glad to see you're doing well.
- Sorry I can't help you.

385
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:50,618
- I'd like to pay for your drink.
- That's fine.

386
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,123
How about that drink?

387
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:57,834
Yeah, how about that drink?

388
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:02,171
Raines! Memphis Raines, huh?

389
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,298
- Do I know you?
- Well, you should know me,

390
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:09,137
considering all the business you done
screwed up for me in the past, baby.

391
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:12,223
- Johnny B.
- That's me.

392
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:13,391
What can I do for you?

393
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,936
Well, I'm gonna tell you
what you can do for me, baby.

394
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,105
Get out of Long Beach tonight.

395
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:22,358
I'll be gone in three days.
I'm just here on some family business.

396
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:27,113
Word on the street says Raymond Calitri
hired you and your brother for a top order.

397
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:30,450
- A order should've went to me.
- That's not the way it went down, Johnny.

398
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:48,259
Hey! Get away from my car, asshole!

399
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:05,109
You got somethin' to say
before I kill you, fool?

400
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,048
Sphinx.

401
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,051
Otto send you?

402
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:47,693
Oh, Dad.

403
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:52,323
Probably both be working
at the dealership if he hadn't died.

404
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:55,451
Just like normal people.

405
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:56,661
Shit.

406
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,751
What's the matter with you?

407
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:08,297
Man, six years does
a lot of different things to people.

408
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:10,758
You know, I don't
know where you went,

409
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:14,595
but, you know, you're in there,
you're talkin' about bein' normal.

410
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:19,100
I mean, you were always the one
who was goin' after the easy money.

411
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:25,189
I didn't do it for the money.

412
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,735
I did it for the cars.

413
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:35,324
Gleaming in marina blue...

414
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:40,454
sunflower yellow... Marlboro red.

415
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:44,292
Begging to be plucked.

416
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,087
And I'd do it.

417
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,548
I'd boost her...

418
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:53,551
and just blast to Palm Springs,

419
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:58,139
instantly feeling
better about being me.

420
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:03,102
And then, the next day, it seems
like, I'm getting shot at,

421
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:07,189
my friends are dying,
people are going to jail.

422
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,276
I didn't like what I'd become.

423
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:16,407
Yeah, and then you left,

424
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:20,077
and then I didn't have
a brother anymore.

425
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:25,124
And now you wanna give me advice,
and I don't even know you.

426
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:28,669
And, you know, I got my own family now.
I got my own friends.

427
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:33,090
And, you know, you can say what you want
about them, but they're loyal.

428
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:38,220
Well, when you hit the wall,
the same thing is gonna happen.

429
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:45,061
You and your family
are either gonna get shot

430
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,271
or get a five-year jolt at Corcoran.

431
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:01,494
Those Mercedes we impounded,
need those newfangled laser-cut keys?

432
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:04,205
Each one's from Dressner Foreign Motors,
downtown Newport,

433
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:06,707
where all the employees are clean
except for him.

434
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:11,754
James Lakewood, served a nickel
at Folsom for auto insurance fraud.

435
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:14,215
Well, gosh, I bet he just neglected
to mention that

436
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,300
to the people
at Dressner Foreign Motors, huh?

437
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,428
It gets better. Young James there
places orders for lost keys

438
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:22,181
to Mercedes home office in Germany.

439
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:29,689
The list.

440
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,857
Ah, the list.

441
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:35,653
I guess we gotta start beatin' the bushes
and try to find out where they... Whoa.

442
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:38,280
- 1967 Shelby GT 500.
- I know. I know.

443
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,199
You got Eleanor here?

444
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:43,744
Otto, there's somebody
here to see you.

445
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:46,872
Oh! The puppy's a big dog now.

446
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,791
- How you doin'?
- Hey, there, Kip. What is this up...

447
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:51,419
What's that up under there?

448
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:54,171
Hey, Otto. How you doin'?
It's a long time.

449
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,756
Good to see you.

450
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:57,466
What are you doin' here, Kip?

451
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,760
Well, actually...
We came to talk about some things.

452
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,554
- About what?
- Well, you know.

453
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:06,392
It seems like you guys need a little help,
and we thought that we should participate.

454
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:08,436
But I just promised Morn
I was getting you out of this.

455
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,646
Listen... No, no, we're talking
about a lot of money here.

456
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,523
- And if you guys think you're gonna be...
- What? Money?

457
00:37:12,523 --> 00:37:13,649
...gettin' into our Kool-Aid...

458
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:16,485
Is that why you think I'm doing this?
You inconsiderate little punk!

459
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:19,905
- If you wanna participate, tell Morn...
- You think three washed-up car thieves...

460
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,867
...why her little pumpkin's gonna get hurt!
- ...are gonna steal 50 cars in two days?

461
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:25,161
Hey. Hey.-

462
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,665
This is why I do not
do business with family.

463
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,418
I think you should consider this.

464
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:35,796
Oh, come on, now, Otto, please. No,
his criminal career has come to an end.

465
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:38,674
Well, his life will come to an end
unless we pull this off.

466
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:43,220
And how can we do it without him?
It can't be done, and you know it.

467
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,602
- You guys have any skills at all?
- Please.

468
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:53,939
Yeah, we have skills. Urn, Mirror Man
here, he's an electronics expert.

469
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:57,943
You know, he's got some gadgets that
you old farts probably never heard of.

470
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,864
You know, uh, Tumbler over here, he can
pretty much drive anything with wheels,

471
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:04,325
and, you know,
some things without wheels.

472
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:10,372
And, uh, Toby, he's a computer genius.
He does fascinating things with computers.

473
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:13,334
What exactly can you do
with a computer, Toby?

474
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,921
I can hack into the DMV mainframe,
I can change VIN numbers,

475
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:21,634
I can change addresses, registrations.
I can do a lot of really tricky stuff, OK?

476
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:24,845
All right, all right,
we do this, we do it my way.

477
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:27,389
I run this show.
You take your orders from me.

478
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,558
If you have any problems with that,
you can leave now.

479
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,602
No, that's fine.

480
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:33,395
Who is Gilligan here,
and what does he do?

481
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:37,691
Gilligan is actually Freb. Freb can order
pizzas like nobody's business.

482
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,401
- What?
- It's true.

483
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,904
Hey, People gotta eat, right?

484
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:47,785
This is outrageous.
I want my lawyer.

485
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:52,748
- I'm not saying a word till I get a lawyer.
- All right, James, that's an option.

486
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:57,503
- And, frankly, a reasonable one.
- So you call your lawyer, James.

487
00:38:57,503 --> 00:39:00,923
You tell him you've been arrested
on suspicion of grand theft auto.

488
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,716
- We indict you.
- He'll bail you out.

489
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,969
- And we move on to trial.
- OK, OK.

490
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:10,724
Kid came to me, said
he'd pay $500 a key.

491
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:16,438
So I put the order forms through, and
he picked 'em up a couple days later.

492
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:21,026
- What's the kid's name?
- We kept it anonymous.

493
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:24,697
He was a well-built kid.
Uh, looks like a boxer.

494
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:29,702
- What do you want me to do?
- When he comes back, you call us.

495
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:33,497
- What says he comes back?
- A hunch.

496
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,917
To make the Friday 8am deadline,
you're gonna have to go old-school.

497
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:41,672
A one-night boost.
Put all your nuts in one basket. OK?

498
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:42,965
- One night?
- Yes.

499
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:44,466
What, are you crazy?
One night?

500
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,968
What, do you have, like,
a better plan or something?

501
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:48,512
Yeah, you spread it out.
You play shadow games and shit.

502
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:49,930
We're on a truncated timetable.

503
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,141
Otto, I'm sorry. Can you just listen
to me for one second?

504
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:54,518
We heard you, Kip.
Shadow games.

505
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:57,605
But what you have to understand
is that if you play shadow games,

506
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:00,107
by the second night,
the heat is onto you.

507
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:04,486
With a one-night boost, by the time
the first car is reported stolen,

508
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:07,823
your ship's set sail.
It's a surprise attack.

509
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:11,702
This is a complicated list, fellas.
it really is. OK?

510
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:15,998
There are 25 that aren't a problem,
but these exotics are tough to find.

511
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:19,543
And the new Mercedes,
they require laser-cut keys. OK?

512
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:22,922
- Yeah, I got that covered.
- You have that covered?

513
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,174
What'd I just say?
Yeah, I got it covered.

514
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:27,927
All right, all right.
Well, then, let's get to work.

515
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,429
Toby, hack into
the insurance database

516
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,097
and find as many cars as you can.

517
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:36,477
Yes! I got addresses on Hilary,
Natalie and Tracy.

518
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:40,022
Donny, check the DMV
for the remaining cars on the list.

519
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:43,609
I'm sorry, miss, but you've missed
five questions. That's failing.

520
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,486
No!

521
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:50,491
No! Why? You're supposed to go
faster when somebody tailgates you!

522
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:51,951
Ah. Hello again.

523
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:55,913
Here's your list of the 20 car owners'
names and addresses that you requested.

524
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:58,749
- Thank you.
- That's $100, please.

525
00:40:58,749 --> 00:40:59,833
$100?

526
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:03,504
Well, $5 a car, 20 cars.
Would you like a calculator?

527
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:06,632
It used to be $2 a car.
Thanks a lot.

528
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:10,719
My name's Roger, sir.
May I be of some help?

529
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:17,851
- That's funny. My name's Roger.
- Two Rogers don't make a right.

530
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,103
- Roger, I have a problem.
- Yes?

531
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:22,398
I've been in LA three months now.
I have money, I have taste.

532
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:23,899
But I'm not on anybody's A list,

533
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,568
and Saturday night is the loneliest
night of the week for me.

534
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:29,530
Well, a Ferrari would
certainly change that.

535
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,699
Perhaps. But, you know...

536
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:33,742
This is the one. Yes, yes, yes.

537
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:37,788
I saw three of these parked outside
the local Starbucks this morning,

538
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:41,709
which tells me only one thing - there's too
many self-indulgent wieners in this city

539
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:43,836
with too much bloody money!

540
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:51,427
Now, if I was driving
a 1967 275 GTB four-cam...

541
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:54,888
You would not be
a self-indulgent wiener, sir.

542
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:56,890
- You'd be a connoisseur.
- Precisely.

543
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,809
Champagne would fall
from the heavens.

544
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:02,646
Doors would open.
Velvet ropes would part.

545
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:07,026
I don't have one here.
However, I do have one in the warehouse.

546
00:42:07,026 --> 00:42:10,988
Superb. What else do you have
in the warehouse?

547
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,701
Mm. All right. Uh-huh.

548
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,912
That was Mr. Lakewood
from the dealership.

549
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,123
He says that boxer-looking punk
is gonna pick up the keys

550
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:23,751
to three new Mercedes today.

551
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:26,253
Same make and model as the ones
we already got impounded.

552
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:27,880
Now we talkin'.

553
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:38,015
The El Spirito de Graciela
sails Friday, 8am sharp.

554
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:41,685
We'll target all the cars
within 45 minutes of here.

555
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:44,855
By the time their alarm-tracking systems
are activated,

556
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:48,192
the cars will already be
in these containers.

557
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:59,161
Fellas, this is Sway.

558
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:01,830
No questions. I'm here for Kip.

559
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,791
- All right.
- All right.

560
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:21,225
It's me. He's here.

561
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:24,353
- In the red Chevy Nova?
- Uh, that's affirmative, sir.

562
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:25,604
What's goin' on, bro?

563
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:28,023
All right, as soon as he leaves,
you call me with the owners' addresses.

564
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,984
- All right?
- I'll get those forms right over, sir.

565
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,989
Damn boss. Always on my case.

566
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,158
- I got three here?
- Mm-hm.

567
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:39,868
Thank you.

568
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:54,049
Huh.

569
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:58,178
Randall Raines, Donny Astricky.
Otto Halliwell.

570
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,931
- Should I set up some tails?
- Uh-uh.

571
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:03,767
They're too smart for that.
They'll just dump the cars.

572
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:06,979
No, we'll get them with the Mercedes.

573
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:11,817
Let's set up, uh, three surveillance
teams at those addresses.

574
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:16,613
Now, you go ahead
and you make your move, man...

575
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,657
and I will be waiting for you.

576
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,789
Why do you call 'em girls' names?

577
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:28,959
That's a good question.
Why do you call 'em girls' names?

578
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:34,047
It's code. You say Jane,
you say Shirley, Lucy, Edna,

579
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:38,010
and nobody listening on the waves
is the wiser.

580
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,970
<i>Got 'em.</i>

581
00:44:47,186 --> 00:44:52,816
All right, we've got the addresses
on all 50 ladies. Let's scout 'em.

582
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:01,283
- There she is.
- Nice.

583
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:04,161
Damn, it's cold up here.
They keep these Ferraris refrigerated?

584
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:07,372
Man, you know black people don't like
cold weather. We're a tropical people, man.

585
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:10,375
When this is over, I'm gonna smoke
a joint, watch two hours of Roots,

586
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,045
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

587
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:16,924
Hello, and welcome
to "TV Car Trivia."

588
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:20,135
First question -
who was the driver of a '73 Firebird?

589
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:23,180
- Uh, Otto.
- Jim Rockford, Rockford Files.

590
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,307
Give me Columbo.

591
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:27,809
- A Peugeot convertible.
- What color?

592
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:28,936
Gray.

593
00:45:28,936 --> 00:45:32,022
- How you know that?
- 'Cause I love that show.

594
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:35,400
Well, I got three words for
all y'all - get a life.

595
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,361
Oh, this is some
kiddie shit, Sphinx.

596
00:45:37,361 --> 00:45:42,324
- What's on Magnum PI's license plate?
- Robin1.

597
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:45,118
Wait, wasn't Robin that
fagoty guy who hung with him?

598
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:47,829
No, that was Higgins.
That was Higgins.

599
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:49,915
Hey, ten points for
our fearless leader.

600
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:54,002
Sway, how about giving us the honor
of the Bill Bixby trifecta?

601
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:58,131
He drove a Corvette
in "The Magician,"

602
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:00,968
a Ford pickup truck
in "The Incredible Hulk,"

603
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:05,931
and in "The Courtship of Eddie's Father,"
he walked.

604
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,897
- Bingo.
- My man.

605
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:29,788
Al, tell me somethin'.

606
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:32,374
Nothin' doin' here, sir.
Nobody's showing.

607
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:34,251
COPY-

608
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:38,922
A minivan approaching. And it seems
a little late for soccer practice.

609
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:45,345
Heads up.
I think we got some activity right here.

610
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:55,147
Oh, that is... Looks like it's Kip Raines.
And we got a Randall Raines.

611
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:57,816
If they take this, we
will take them down.

612
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,820
He's pulling something out of his pocket.
You see that?

613
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,741
It's a camera. Looks like
he's just doing some homework.

614
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:10,120
All right, let's leave him be. I don't
wanna burn this. They will be back.

615
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:14,916
Huh.

616
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,337
You know what?
Let's go over to Otto's in the morning.

617
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:21,298
Kick over some rocks,
see what's underneath there.

618
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:27,763
We saved the best for last -
the '67 Shelby Mustang GT 500.

619
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:31,224
- The GT 500?
- Yeah, yeah.

620
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:38,106
There she is.

621
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:39,816
Yep.

622
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,693
There's Eleanor.

623
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:47,157
- Eleanor is Memphis's unicorn.
- What's a unicorn?

624
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:51,370
A fabled creature? You know, the horse
with the horn? Impossible to capture?

625
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:55,290
The one car no matter how many times you
try to boost, something always happens.

626
00:48:00,337 --> 00:48:04,841
We're gonna get through this
this time, right? It's gonna be smooth.

627
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:07,177
- What's he doing?
- It's gonna be easy.

628
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:10,847
He's talking to her, man.
Trying to get reacquainted.

629
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:15,894
You know, they had a rough history. She
almost got him killed a couple of times.

630
00:48:15,894 --> 00:48:19,940
- He flipped one on the Harbor Freeway.
- He went off the Long Beach Pier once.

631
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,401
A smooth, easy ride.

632
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:25,904
We're just gonna glide.

633
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:33,078
Big night tomorrow, guys.
Let's go home.

634
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:35,831
- Did you get the picture?
- Yeah.

635
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:39,793
See you tomorrow night, Eleanor,
with your fine ass.

636
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:46,967
Yeah, we're almost home.
You wanna get something to eat?

637
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,302
I'd like to get a chocolate malt.

638
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:02,315
- Hey, man!
- Get out of the car!

639
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,069
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

640
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:13,493
- Why are people shooting at us?
- 'Cause I blew up their car.

641
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:36,683
Over here!

642
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:45,400
"Beast"?

643
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,360
OK, OK.

644
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,618
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

645
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:57,454
Aah!

646
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:06,505
on!

647
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,374
Oh, you think it's a game?

648
00:50:42,374 --> 00:50:45,377
Johnny B! Cops, man.

649
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:49,089
I ain't got nothin'
but time, baby.

650
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,435
Oh, man, we're gonna
be here all night, man.

651
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:07,440
Look! Cop car! Uh-huh!

652
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,238
Long as I'm in here, you're just gonna
sit out there. Aren't ya? A'ight?

653
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:18,410
Hey, listen, this is the plan.
This is what we're gonna do.

654
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,619
There's a big rig over there.

655
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:27,210
Uh, mister, is that your truck
out there, the Big Rig Wrecker?

656
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:29,170
- The Big Rig Wrecker's mine...
- That's cool.

657
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,271
What do I gotta do? How do I learn?
What do I do? Where do I go?

658
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:49,566
- Well, you gotta go to truck-driving school.
- Truck dri... I know, man, I know.

659
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:51,234
But I mean, like, um...

660
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:55,739
You boys ready to play
a little pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey?

661
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:58,158
Can I get you a jelly doughnut
or something, man?

662
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:00,327
- No, I'm just gonna go ahead and go.
- 'Cause I'm gonna have the waffle...

663
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:02,287
Maybe next time, though.

664
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:23,350
I'm gonna smoke you!

665
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:38,698
Damn!

666
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,408
What the hell's going on?

667
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:46,581
Want some of this?

668
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:47,540
Yeah.

669
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:54,297
- You guys got permits for these weapons?
- Oh, man.

670
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:14,734
So you think I can
only get pizzas, huh?

671
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:18,697
- Boosted it myself.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. How'd you get it?

672
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:20,240
Actually, the keys were in it.

673
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,409
Well, that kind of
defies the point then, don't it?

674
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:27,872
You stole a car that wasn't on the list.
You stole a car that wasn't on the list!

675
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,917
Why didn't you just go to the police
station in a red clown suit

676
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:32,794
and let everybody know
what we're doin' here?

677
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:36,172
- What have we got?
- I don't know.

678
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:39,592
- Shit! Fellas.
- What?

679
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:42,554
- Give me that. Let me see that.
- Check this out. Check this out!

680
00:53:42,554 --> 00:53:44,556
- What?
- Look.

681
00:53:44,556 --> 00:53:46,558
- This looks like heroin.
- What?

682
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:50,812
Where did you get this car?

683
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:52,480
In front of some poker parlor
in Chinatown.

684
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,692
Ever consider why a car in a neighborhood
like that would have its keys left in it?

685
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:57,318
Maybe because nobody
in that neighborhood

686
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,529
would be stupid enough
to try to rip this car off.

687
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:02,282
- Get this shit out of here. Take it back.
- No, no, no, we can't take it back.

688
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:03,867
- Get it out of here!
- Will everybody relax for a second?

689
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:06,327
Shut up!

690
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:07,370
Take it back!

691
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:11,916
I'm comin' after this shit.
Give me that. Give me that.

692
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,252
Now! Now!

693
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:17,255
- Look what you...
- Man, I will knock the shit out of you.

694
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:18,548
- Shut up.
- Wait, wait, wait.

695
00:54:20,467 --> 00:54:23,386
- Who is it?
- Detective Castlebeck.

696
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,221
Oh, Christ!

697
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:40,862
Goddammit.

698
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:45,158
- Hey. Hello, Otto.
- Detective. Good to see ya.

699
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:48,495
- Long time.
- Yeah. You're looking good.

700
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,914
Thank you.

701
00:54:50,914 --> 00:54:53,374
So, Randall, what do we got here?

702
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:55,960
We got a multigenerational
gathering of players?

703
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,296
- Is that what we got here?
- Yeah, right.

704
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,673
Here's Donny.

705
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,426
- How you been, D?
- I'm just happy to see you, brother.

706
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:05,678
Yeah.
I got to tell you, Randall,

707
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:08,765
seeing you here, Otto, Donny...

708
00:55:08,765 --> 00:55:11,142
makes me feel almost nostalgic.

709
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:13,686
Kind of like a big reunion.

710
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:19,192
You should stick around, 'cause later we're
gonna make s'mores and sing "Kumbaya."

711
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:23,279
- What is this?
- What, this?

712
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:25,865
- This.
- They call this a Cadillac.

713
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:30,662
- What's wrong with it, Otto?
- Needs restoration.

714
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:33,665
- What?
- Brightening.

715
00:55:33,665 --> 00:55:37,710
- Otto. You got a '39 Ford right there.
- Well, that's a pretty car, isn't it?

716
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:41,506
- Isn't that a nice car?
- Right here you got a '53 Fiat Vignale.

717
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:45,885
Now these are beautiful cars, Otto.
And here we got a '83 Cadillac Eldorado?

718
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:46,845
Yeah.

719
00:55:46,845 --> 00:55:51,850
I mean, who the hell pays
to brighten up a Cadillac Eldorado?

720
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:55,436
I think it holds a certain...
sentimental value, you know?

721
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,897
N-nothing more.

722
00:55:59,566 --> 00:56:01,651
Run me down a tag.

723
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:07,824
License 329 HRO.

724
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:13,413
That is, Harold, Randall, Otto.
Burgundy Cadillac.

725
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:21,337
No faith in our newfound
goodness, Detective, huh?

726
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:24,757
Task force runs on statistics
and numbers, Otto. You know that.

727
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:30,555
- Randall, this Kip?
- That's my brother. He's all grown up.

728
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:32,640
One Baker Eleven,
Pacific Division.

729
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,976
Three two niner
Harold Randall Otto -

730
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:39,564
no wants, no warrants at this time.
DMV not on file.

731
00:56:39,564 --> 00:56:42,734
- Copy that. Thank you.
- See, I know what you're doing.

732
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:45,737
I know.
You're thinking there's no want,

733
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:49,908
but that I stripped its guts
and crated her up, right?

734
00:56:49,908 --> 00:56:52,660
- Is that what you did, Randall?
- No, I didn't do it.

735
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,746
You know, forget it.
You're trying to hurt my feelings? Fine!

736
00:56:54,746 --> 00:56:56,915
You know what? Go ahead.
Do it. Let her rip.

737
00:56:56,915 --> 00:56:58,875
- Go ahead. Rev it up.
- All right, goddammit, I will.

738
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:02,295
Sell it to you cheap.

739
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:05,298
Yeah, '83, first year they put
the auto-ride control on these boys.

740
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:08,635
Oh, I don't know. You probably know
more about cars at this point than I do.

741
00:57:08,635 --> 00:57:10,428
Ha! What, you slippin'
on me, Randall?

742
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:13,264
No, it's just your knowledge
overwhelms me.

743
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,350
It's got a real nice-sounding engine,
right, Otto?

744
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,476
4.1-liter.

745
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,394
- Digital fuel injection?
- You got it.

746
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:20,271
- Let's see what she got.
- You the man.

747
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:28,446
Give it some more.
Give it some more.

748
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:30,740
- Yeah, that's it!
- Go! Go!

749
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,867
- Let's go!
- Come on.

750
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,536
Baby, don't be so mean!

751
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:38,790
- Yeah, that's it!
- OK, yeah. That was good.

752
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,709
Yeah, you break it,
you buy it, my friend.

753
00:57:42,752 --> 00:57:45,838
Yeah,
she got some power goin' on.

754
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:49,759
All right.

755
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,555
I'll catch you later, then.

756
00:58:10,822 --> 00:58:13,408
- It's on for tonight.
- How do you know?

757
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:18,705
They got the call signs
of all the units working tonight.

758
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:22,667
What were you gonna do with this?

759
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:25,628
- I was gonna bonk it.
- What? Bonk?

760
00:58:25,628 --> 00:58:30,466
For the next 24 hours, all your decision-
making privileges have been removed!

761
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:31,968
- You got it?
- Got it.

762
00:58:31,968 --> 00:58:32,885
Yeah, that's cool, man.

763
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:36,556
Obviously, they're on to us.
He's sniff in' real close.

764
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:38,433
If anything tonight
appears out of place,

765
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:41,436
I want you to cut bait,
get out of there and walk away.

766
00:58:41,436 --> 00:58:43,396
And get rid of this goddamn car!

767
00:58:46,232 --> 00:58:49,569
- What's up, Kip?
- Toby, what are you doin'?

768
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:51,612
You think you're comin' with us,
but you're not.

769
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,656
What are you talkin' about, man?
I'm part of the team. I get to go.

770
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:55,783
No, no, wake up.
You're gonna end up in jail

771
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:58,828
or in the morgue or some shit.
Don't be stupid.

772
00:58:58,828 --> 00:59:00,955
What am I supposed to do?

773
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,207
Did you see a box
of rubber gloves here, man?

774
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:08,046
Gloves? Man, you don't need gloves.
This is the new age. Check this out.

775
00:59:08,046 --> 00:59:12,800
- What is this?
- Let me see that big claw you call a hand.

776
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,261
That's not doughnut jelly,
so don't eat it.

777
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:19,140
Your new fingerprints.
Elvis is back.

778
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,728
- Boy got skills, right?
- Yeah, you do.

779
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,898
Look like a little ghetto Smurf.

780
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,754
I am a bad man.

781
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,681
Thanks. Thanks for doin' this.

782
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:04,519
Keep it real.

783
01:00:04,519 --> 01:00:08,523
Think slow.
We should get through it just fine.

784
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,653
"Low Rider," Donny.

785
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:14,946
Donny? "Low Rider."

786
01:00:42,557 --> 01:00:45,184
OK, let's ride.

787
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:01,075
Oh, shit!

788
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:07,039
Give me the damn torch.

789
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,208
Ha-ha! What?

790
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:12,670
I tell you, I'm the man.
Now, where does this go?

791
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,214
Find a way to get in here.
Get this...

792
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:20,303
I tell you, I'm running this shit!
You do that again, I will kick...

793
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:22,805
Cool, man. You don't have
to take it so damn personal.

794
01:01:24,724 --> 01:01:27,518
Ah! Everything is perfect.

795
01:01:40,907 --> 01:01:45,870
Hello, ladies.
Always was a sucker for a redhead.

796
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,706
Let's go. Come on.
Move, move. Go, go!

797
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:55,087
Work your magic, baby. I know
you know Ferraris. Work your magic.

798
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:57,298
Girl got skills.

799
01:01:57,298 --> 01:01:58,341
Whoo!

800
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:24,909
You all right?

801
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:30,831
- You think we're gonna make it?
- I don't know. It's too early to tell.

802
01:02:55,648 --> 01:02:58,609
Diana, Tricia, Nadine
and Rose are on their way.

803
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,903
Good goin', guys.

804
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:23,259
Al, tell me something.

805
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:28,014
Unit Two.
Sorry, sir, nothin' yet.

806
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:33,352
Son of a bitch. I know you're not
parking right in front of me.

807
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:35,688
Oh, no, I can't see a damn thing.

808
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:38,816
All right, we gotta move.

809
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:57,877
- You ever feel bad about any of this?
- Hell, no.

810
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:01,172
I'm Robin Hood, man. I rob from
the rich and give to the needy.

811
01:04:01,172 --> 01:04:02,923
Damn!

812
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,885
- Donny!
- I got you. I got you

813
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:10,222
- You mean the poor.
- Cutters.

814
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,016
Cutters.

815
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:14,977
No, like I said, the needy.

816
01:04:16,854 --> 01:04:18,898
'Cause, brother, we need this car.

817
01:04:26,572 --> 01:04:29,575
- What's up, Doc?
- You're new, aren't you?

818
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:31,660
- Yeah, how can you tell?
- Now, listen, son.

819
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:35,206
- You take real good care of this car...
- All right.

820
01:04:35,206 --> 01:04:36,874
...and I'll take care of you.

821
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:39,293
Tell you what. Save it. You get another
one of these suits, all right?

822
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:42,254
- God bless you, son.
- You need a fashion counselor.

823
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:44,090
All right, babe. I ain't here
for the door. I'm here for the car.

824
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,133
- Get your big ass out.
- Hm?

825
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,094
Out! What the hell you lookin' at?

826
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:54,642
- Damn, man, that was easy as pie.
- I'm a veteran, son.

827
01:04:54,642 --> 01:04:56,769
Get out of the car, bitch,
or I'll blow your brains out!

828
01:04:56,769 --> 01:05:00,064
- You gotta be shittin' me.
- I will shoot you, dammit!

829
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:00,898
Damn!

830
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:04,610
You lazy, half-ass bully!

831
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:06,654
Any asshole can pull
a gun on somebody!

832
01:05:06,654 --> 01:05:10,157
You don't know the first thing
about stealing a car. Boy, I...

833
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:11,951
You need a role model!

834
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:16,122
Stacy.

835
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:41,230
Shannon.

836
01:05:58,956 --> 01:05:59,707
Laura.

837
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:05,045
Lindsay.

838
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:07,006
Rachel.

839
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:22,730
Hey. Check this out.

840
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:35,576
JJ, he's back, but he's smart.
He watches his ass.

841
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:37,328
Just hold our positions.

842
01:06:37,328 --> 01:06:40,414
- If he rolls, you follow him out.
- Copy that.

843
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:51,300
What's he doing?

844
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,177
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

845
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:04,188
We might as well roll down
our windows and wave.

846
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:06,440
- JJ, you tail him, all right?
- Copy that.

847
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:13,322
Let's go.

848
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:20,371
- Good luck.
- Piece of cake.

849
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:27,336
Unit One, this is Unit Two.
Astricky has landed.

850
01:07:27,336 --> 01:07:29,421
If they roll,
we take 'em down.

851
01:07:31,549 --> 01:07:36,095
Last night that van was parked
four houses down. Now it's only two.

852
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:40,558
- We got company.
- Shit.

853
01:07:40,558 --> 01:07:41,684
He's at the car.

854
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,565
Bird, come back.

855
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,693
Stand by, Unit One.

856
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:51,735
What?

857
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:54,113
- Where are you?
- Where do you think I am?

858
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:57,074
I'm at the casino, picking up
the pit boss's lady. What do you want?

859
01:07:57,074 --> 01:07:59,410
The ladies are dirty.
Walk away.

860
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:01,245
- The ladies are dirty.
- What?

861
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:03,914
I want everybody to get back
to the garage now.

862
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:06,917
Oh, so she's having
the baby right now?

863
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:09,044
- I guess I better get to the hospital, then.
- He's having a baby.

864
01:08:09,044 --> 01:08:12,590
- Something's got him spooked.
- My wife is having a baby.

865
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:16,176
Gotta get... I'm just nervous. This
ain't even my car. I'm way over here.

866
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:19,346
He's heading away from the vehicle.

867
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:25,269
I see you.

868
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:30,566
Pull in over there.

869
01:08:45,581 --> 01:08:49,168
Uh, this is Unit Two.
I lost them.

870
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,008
All right, it's time
to talk to Fuzzy again.

871
01:08:57,509 --> 01:08:59,637
Check this out.
Laser-encoded keys

872
01:08:59,637 --> 01:09:02,806
that send a message
to a receiver inside the car.

873
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:05,351
You wanna tell me what you're
doin' with these?

874
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:08,312
Yeah, these are from last week.
These are from the other boost.

875
01:09:13,067 --> 01:09:16,487
- Give me this back.
- Who is it?

876
01:09:17,905 --> 01:09:21,408
- Where did they come from?
- It's the keys! The keys! The keys!

877
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:23,410
- Give me them!
- Take it easy!

878
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,079
Now, give me this!

879
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:26,580
- What happened?
- Where'd you get these from?

880
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,208
- What's the problem?
- The Mercedes are dirty!

881
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:31,418
There are surveillance vans all over them.
Where'd they come from?

882
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:35,339
My guy in Southland. The same guy I used
last time. Same guy I used before.

883
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:38,425
- Before when?
- When we took the other cars.

884
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:40,719
- Other Mercedes.
- Oh, Christ.

885
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,596
Castlebeck.

886
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:44,723
He got to one of the guys
at the dealership and he turned him.

887
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:48,644
- That's what happened.
- Eight hours left.

888
01:09:48,644 --> 01:09:50,562
So, what? We're gonna
stand around and have a meeting?

889
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:52,481
What's going on?

890
01:09:52,481 --> 01:09:54,566
Memphis...

891
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:57,277
Maybe it's time for us to start thinking
about how to get these kids out of town...

892
01:09:57,277 --> 01:10:00,989
- Oh, man, you know what? No! That's...
- What are you talking about?

893
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:02,449
If there's no Mercedes,

894
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:06,328
there's no point in boosting any
other cars. You hear me? That's it.

895
01:10:06,328 --> 01:10:08,664
47 is not 50, Memphis.
You know that's what he'll say.

896
01:10:08,664 --> 01:10:10,708
Yeah.

897
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:15,212
Hey, Memphis, you know, we still have
the Mercedes keys from the last boost.

898
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:19,591
Hey! Those cars are
at the police impound.

899
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:22,720
OK? The police impound. You want us
to go there and start stealin' cars?

900
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,346
- Yeah.
- What?

901
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:25,764
- Yeah, let's do it.
- You're crazy.

902
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:30,394
- We're gonna get hectic. Let's go.
- No, Memphis, no. Don't do this!

903
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:33,021
Hey, Sphinx,
I don't look suspicious, do I, man?

904
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:36,024
Otto, man, I think that
your dog ate the keys!

905
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:39,319
Wait. He usually goes
for license plates.

906
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:42,406
- You sure? What?
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

907
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:45,701
- The dog ate the keys?
- Yes.

908
01:10:45,701 --> 01:10:48,787
- How are you gonna get them out?
- Not funny.

909
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:51,749
- Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Don't even think about it, Sphinx.

910
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:54,168
It's all right.

911
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,504
Say, Toby.

912
01:10:57,504 --> 01:11:02,134
- See if you can get some Alpo and Ex-Lax.
- Oh, Lord.

913
01:11:02,134 --> 01:11:05,137
- No way, man!
- Bad dog!

914
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:07,014
Let's get back to work.

915
01:11:21,904 --> 01:11:25,365
- Hey! Open the door!
- Oh, Jesus.

916
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:27,910
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- End it, rock star. Get in.

917
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:30,496
Jesus Christ!

918
01:11:30,496 --> 01:11:32,706
Now what, man? What else?

919
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:37,920
Fuzzy, you never called me.
So now we gotta stay down here

920
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,297
till you tell me everything you know.

921
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:44,760
I told you everything I know. I know that,
because I said, "This is everything I know."

922
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,928
Detective Drycoff,

923
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:49,348
does it seem like the suspect
is violating his parole right now?

924
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:52,434
Why, yes, Detective Castlebeck.
if by violating his parole

925
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:54,937
you mean failing to cooperate
with a law enforcement officer.

926
01:12:01,068 --> 01:12:04,738
A little trick I learned
in the car-thief retirement home.

927
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:06,448
Could you hold this?

928
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:09,743
No, no, no, I'm not failing
to cooperate. It's just that...

929
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:16,041
Yeah, OK, OK. Word has it that Kip Raines
took the job, and he screwed up.

930
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:17,793
He screwed up pretty bad.

931
01:12:17,793 --> 01:12:20,003
And who put out the
order for the job?

932
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:25,634
It's Raymond Calitri's order.

933
01:12:25,634 --> 01:12:27,052
Nice.

934
01:12:33,559 --> 01:12:35,435
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

935
01:12:36,353 --> 01:12:39,356
Yes!

936
01:12:42,568 --> 01:12:45,362
We have six hours left.
Has the dog done its business yet?

937
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:48,282
Toby and Freb
are walking him right now.

938
01:12:48,282 --> 01:12:50,951
He's not gonna do it.
It's not gonna happen, man.

939
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:55,789
Come on, dog.
What's wrong, Hemi? Poop, dog.

940
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,878
- It had to be a girl car.
- Girl car?

941
01:13:00,878 --> 01:13:03,755
What kind of a girl
drives a Hemi 'Cuda?

942
01:13:03,755 --> 01:13:06,675
I'll show you.

943
01:13:06,675 --> 01:13:08,719
Lipstick?

944
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:11,513
Matches the car.

945
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:15,058
What's next? Blush? Mascara?

946
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:19,313
Next time I'll pull out
the leather and high heels

947
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:21,398
and pink underwear for you.

948
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:24,109
- Leather, high heels and pink underwear.
- Pink underwear.

949
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:26,695
Pink underwear works.
Pink underwear works.

950
01:13:29,615 --> 01:13:34,620
Raymond Vincent Calitri did five years
in South London for manslaughter.

951
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:37,414
- He immigrated in '98.
- Look at this.

952
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:42,878
Loansharking, extortion, fencing.
Ha-ha. His front's a salvage yard.

953
01:14:00,187 --> 01:14:02,731
Gonna have to wait it out.

954
01:14:05,901 --> 01:14:10,364
- So, you seeing anybody?
- No.

955
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:14,534
No, I had a girl once.
She was great.

956
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:16,620
Hm. So...

957
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,664
If she was so great,
Why'd you leave her?

958
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:41,561
I did ask you to come with me.

959
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:46,817
No, you asked me
to be a different person.

960
01:14:46,817 --> 01:14:52,197
I didn't want to see people get hurt.
I just wanted you to slow down.

961
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:55,200
Well, I couldn't.

962
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:59,538
- 'Cause I wasn't ready.
- You're straight now.

963
01:14:59,538 --> 01:15:03,583
Yeah, I am.
'Cause it wasn't the same without you.

964
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:11,800
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Hey, asshole. I was reading that.

965
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,510
- Watch your mouth, kid.
- What's goin' on?

966
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,971
This is a homicide file
from a homicide investigation.

967
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:19,016
It took us three months to get
a magistrate to give us a wiretap on him.

968
01:15:19,016 --> 01:15:21,560
No other division, including GRAB,

969
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,605
can go near his person, residence
or place of business, all right?

970
01:15:25,605 --> 01:15:27,941
You got it? Let me tell you guys
something, all right?

971
01:15:27,941 --> 01:15:31,862
Raymond Calitri is going down
for murder one, boneheads.

972
01:15:31,862 --> 01:15:35,657
Who gives a shit about
grand theft auto? Really?

973
01:15:37,659 --> 01:15:39,202
Man, I can't watch this.

974
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:42,497
Come on, come on, come on.
Get it on. Get it over with.

975
01:15:48,045 --> 01:15:52,507
What do you think is more exciting,
having sex or stealing cars?

976
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:54,676
Having sex or boosting cars?

977
01:15:54,676 --> 01:15:56,678
Um...

978
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:59,723
Ooh!

979
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:01,683
Well... um...

980
01:16:01,683 --> 01:16:04,394
Well...

981
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:09,775
How about having sex
while boosting cars?

982
01:16:09,775 --> 01:16:13,737
God, that's a good line.
Ooh...

983
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:15,405
Doesn't work on a lot
of girls, though.

984
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:18,700
I just blurted it out.
I'm s...

985
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:23,997
But you haven't
answered the question.

986
01:16:23,997 --> 01:16:29,127
Well, you see, the problem is,
how do you get over the shifter?

987
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:32,422
- Oh. Oh, right. 'Cause the...
- 'Cause it gets in the way.

988
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:37,677
Because you wouldn't want to disrupt
the synchromesh, right?

989
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:41,431
Or... the throttle linkage.

990
01:16:46,853 --> 01:16:49,689
The clutch master cylinder.

991
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:57,656
- Or the overhead camshaft.
- I can't do this.

992
01:16:57,656 --> 01:17:01,493
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Straight in-line six.

993
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:06,706
Triple Weber carburetors bolted
to each other's body structures.

994
01:17:08,959 --> 01:17:11,628
- What?
- Well, it's time to work.

995
01:17:11,628 --> 01:17:15,841
Good brakes.
Good brakes, too.

996
01:17:30,105 --> 01:17:33,733
- There's nothing happening.
- Maybe he's got indigestion.

997
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:35,777
Well, dude,
give him some more Ex-Lax.

998
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:37,904
- He already ate two.
- Hey, little man.

999
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:40,782
Oh, man.

1000
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:44,744
I thought I told you this is our turf.
What, you want to make a move?

1001
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:46,746
We don't want anything
to do with your turf.

1002
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:48,748
Something wrong with
where we live, dog?

1003
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:51,293
No, no, it's cool for you.
I mean, it's just not for us.

1004
01:17:51,293 --> 01:17:53,753
So now you think you're better than us?

1005
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:55,797
Maybe we should cut you up, dog?

1006
01:17:57,299 --> 01:18:02,637
- Dude, the keys.
- Right. Excuse me a second, guys.

1007
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:05,348
Oh, man!

1008
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:08,727
- Oh, I'm gonna throw up, dog!
- Man, that's disgusting.

1009
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:11,938
What kind of pervert gets
their jollies off playing with dog shit?

1010
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:14,608
Look, man, I got 'em!
Look! All three, man!

1011
01:18:14,608 --> 01:18:17,068
- You guys are sick!
- I got 'em!

1012
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:32,334
Wake up, man.
Check this out.

1013
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:35,837
Every time I drive my Volvo
in Beverly Hills, they tow the shit.

1014
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:49,017
- We ain't got any Volvos here.
- There is a Volvo here. I know it.

1015
01:18:49,017 --> 01:18:50,894
- They told me...
- Just wait a minute. Wait, wait.

1016
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:53,855
What I'm tryin' to tell you is,
there ain't no Volvos here.

1017
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:03,031
Then get in your book, do something.
Find my damn Volvo!

1018
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:05,867
Sphinx. Sway.

1019
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:08,119
It's got to be somewhere in there.
Check it out, man.

1020
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:12,123
Wait, wait. It's not. Nothing here.
There's nothing here. Look.

1021
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:13,833
- So, look, there's another one back here...
- No! No!

1022
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:16,586
No, no. Hey, hey, hey, tell you what.
Look at this.

1023
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,978
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't even need to be out here.

1024
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:34,312
Hey...

1025
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:38,191
I got a midget pagin' me right now.
I gotta get outta here. Time is money.

1026
01:19:40,068 --> 01:19:43,822
This is the worst
damn day of my life!

1027
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:52,247
"Detective Castlebeck.
Glass shards from the warehouse

1028
01:19:52,247 --> 01:19:57,460
were from a black-light bulb
available at any local hardware store."

1029
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:03,049
All right, what the hell
is a black-light bulb

1030
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:07,012
doin' in a warehouse in Long Beach?

1031
01:20:12,017 --> 01:20:14,227
Come with me.

1032
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:24,863
- See this glass right here?
- Let me guess. Black-light?

1033
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:28,491
Black-light. You take that
wall, I'll take this wall.

1034
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:33,204
- Remember the '70s?
- Too young, thank God.

1035
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:36,082
Black-lights were
all the rage back then.

1036
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:39,586
You know, they had this ink,
these Magic Markers.

1037
01:20:39,586 --> 01:20:41,921
Only show up under black-light.

1038
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:46,801
So if you got a whole lot of information
that you don't want anybody to have...

1039
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:50,388
- Like a shopping list of cars?
- There you go.

1040
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:51,973
Whoa!

1041
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:54,517
Yes! Yes!

1042
01:20:54,517 --> 01:20:57,103
Here is our list.

1043
01:20:57,103 --> 01:20:59,314
That's a big list.

1044
01:20:59,314 --> 01:21:02,609
- We can't handle all these cars.
- Maybe we don't have to.

1045
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:04,861
I tell you what, let's concentrate
on the rarest ones,

1046
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:07,238
and let's just hope for some luck.

1047
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:09,282
Let's get somebody
on these right here.

1048
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:12,827
You and I will take this one right here.
'67 Shelby Mustang.

1049
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:15,080
- Can't be but a few of these in town.
- Yeah.

1050
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,332
But how do you know
he hasn't already stolen it?

1051
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:20,794
Oh, if I know our boy, I believe
he'll leave this one till last.

1052
01:21:20,794 --> 01:21:23,296
- Why?
- He's afraid of it.

1053
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:39,187
Yo, guys.
It's me. Man.

1054
01:21:39,187 --> 01:21:41,398
Oh, man.
What are you doing?

1055
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:43,274
I wanna roll with you
guys on a boost.

1056
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:45,944
Later. Come on.

1057
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:02,043
Go, 90, 90-

1058
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:17,392
- What's the matter with you? Come on!
- Hey! Call security!

1059
01:22:17,392 --> 01:22:19,144
- I'm coming.
- Someone's stealing the car!

1060
01:22:19,144 --> 01:22:23,398
- Go! Go! Go! What are you doing?
- Jesus, bro. I ought to leave your ass.

1061
01:22:23,398 --> 01:22:25,024
You know that?
What's the matter with you?

1062
01:22:37,162 --> 01:22:38,872
Hey, Sphinx, check this out.

1063
01:22:38,872 --> 01:22:41,249
Homeboy got "Snake"
on the license plate.

1064
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:45,503
Well, Snake gonna have to slither his ass
all the way to the bus stop in the morning.

1065
01:22:49,174 --> 01:22:52,343
Police officers.
We need to check the lot for a car.

1066
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:54,554
Go ahead.

1067
01:23:00,685 --> 01:23:03,354
Check this out, man.
Here's some low-ridin' music.

1068
01:23:03,354 --> 01:23:05,482
It's a little bit different than that
cracker shit you used to be playin'.

1069
01:23:05,482 --> 01:23:07,025
Check this out.

1070
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:13,198
Ah, you like that.
You feelin' it?

1071
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:15,909
Are you feelin' it?
I know you're feelin' it.

1072
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:21,247
Oh! Snake!
Get this thing off me!

1073
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:23,625
Snake!Snake!Snake!

1074
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:35,011
Get this thing off me, man!
It's a snake!

1075
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:37,305
It's trying to kill me, man!
Get this thing off me!

1076
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,475
Man, they always want to kill
a brother, man! This is wrong!

1077
01:23:40,475 --> 01:23:43,186
What the hell are you doing?
Get the snake!

1078
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,232
- Use the brakes!
- I am!

1079
01:23:50,443 --> 01:23:51,486
Aaargh!

1080
01:23:51,486 --> 01:23:55,323
This snake is crawlin' up my ass, man!
The snake is up my ass!

1081
01:23:57,158 --> 01:23:59,077
This snake gonna swallow
my shit whole, man!

1082
01:24:27,939 --> 01:24:30,024
God, I love that car.

1083
01:24:30,024 --> 01:24:32,026
All right, two ladies home safe.

1084
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:36,531
He's tucking in Vanessa,
and Bernadine just took me for a ride.

1085
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:40,868
- What's the count?
- 48.

1086
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:42,245
Yes!

1087
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:44,872
Yeah, but Mirror and Sphinx
had some unexpected visitors.

1088
01:24:44,872 --> 01:24:47,333
- Castlebeck?
- I think so.

1089
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,294
- Everything cool?
- Yeah, yeah, they're fine.

1090
01:24:49,294 --> 01:24:52,672
They're on their way back to Otto's.
Donny and Freb are already there.

1091
01:24:52,672 --> 01:24:56,050
- What about Kip and Tumbler?
- No word yet.

1092
01:24:57,093 --> 01:24:59,178
Lost in suburbia.
Hell, where are we?

1093
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:00,471
What do you mean?
You don't know where you're goin'?

1094
01:25:00,471 --> 01:25:02,307
Which way is out?
I don't know where I am.

1095
01:25:02,307 --> 01:25:05,059
- Everything looks the same to me.
- You don't know where you're going?

1096
01:25:05,059 --> 01:25:06,978
- That is a cop.
- No, it's not, that's a rent-a-cop.

1097
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:11,316
- Slow down, slow down.
- He's pulling a U-turn.

1098
01:25:14,068 --> 01:25:15,903
Oh, man, we're in big trouble.

1099
01:25:15,903 --> 01:25:20,408
In pursuit of stolen Cadillac
SUV, traveling west on Murray Drive.

1100
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:23,119
- Roadblock, Kip.
- Dude, look out for the roadblock!

1101
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:24,495
- Shit!
- Go, go!

1102
01:25:31,252 --> 01:25:32,045
Go!

1103
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:38,635
Oh, man!

1104
01:25:38,635 --> 01:25:41,095
- Son of a bitch!
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1105
01:25:41,095 --> 01:25:44,390
- I need some help, man.
- What's the matter? What?

1106
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:47,268
- He's been shot! Oh, shit! Shit!
- Don't touch me!

1107
01:25:47,268 --> 01:25:48,936
Dude, go to the hospital, man!

1108
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:52,106
- People ask questions in hospitals, Kip.
- Go to the hospital!

1109
01:25:52,106 --> 01:25:54,942
- Use your head. We're in a stolen car!
- Oh, man!

1110
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:58,655
- Oh, man! Don't move, man.
- Now this does not look good.

1111
01:25:58,655 --> 01:26:01,991
- It's gonna be all right, man.
- Relax.

1112
01:26:04,077 --> 01:26:05,953
- Oh, man!
- What happened?

1113
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:07,997
We ran into a security patrol, man.

1114
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:09,248
He hid in the van.
We didn't know he was there.

1115
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:12,001
We gotta get you to a doctor.
Private. I know just where to go.

1116
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:14,629
- Let's get him to a car.
- No! Ow!

1117
01:26:16,923 --> 01:26:20,510
Lie in the back.
Lie down in the back.

1118
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:23,471
Tumbler, you and Kip
take the last van back to Otto's.

1119
01:26:28,017 --> 01:26:31,187
- What are you doin'?
- I'm goin' with him.

1120
01:26:35,942 --> 01:26:38,403
- If something should go wrong...
- Let's go!

1121
01:26:38,403 --> 01:26:40,238
I'll take care of him, man.

1122
01:26:44,242 --> 01:26:46,619
Let's finish this.

1123
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:04,470
- What's up?
- What's the story with that Humvee?

1124
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:06,556
- Gone.
- Cadillac?

1125
01:27:06,556 --> 01:27:08,683
Same. Where we goin'?

1126
01:27:08,683 --> 01:27:10,685
The only '67 Shelby in the area

1127
01:27:10,685 --> 01:27:13,646
is registered at a place called
the International Towers in Long Beach.

1128
01:27:13,646 --> 01:27:16,524
Let's go to Long Beach.

1129
01:27:50,224 --> 01:27:52,643
I know we got a history, Eleanor,

1130
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:55,563
and that that history
has not been great,

1131
01:27:55,563 --> 01:27:57,690
but I promise,

1132
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:59,859
you take care of me,
I'll take care of you.

1133
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:23,508
Shit.

1134
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:30,681
The easy way or the hard way, Raines?
Easy way or the hard way?

1135
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:42,276
Hey!

1136
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:44,862
I think he's choosin' the hard way.

1137
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:48,199
All right.

1138
01:29:00,503 --> 01:29:04,632
One Baker Eleven.
In pursuit of '67 Ford Mustang, gray.

1139
01:29:10,513 --> 01:29:13,724
- That sign said "do not enter."
- Yeah. You noticed, huh?

1140
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:15,393
- Jeez.
- Keep your pants on.

1141
01:29:18,855 --> 01:29:22,483
Suspect now traveling
east on Fourth Street.

1142
01:29:28,573 --> 01:29:31,492
Correction.
Make that north on Main.

1143
01:29:46,716 --> 01:29:48,759
- Move!
- Back up! Get the...

1144
01:30:00,813 --> 01:30:02,273
Get outta there!

1145
01:30:06,694 --> 01:30:09,322
Oh, you wanna get crazy with me?

1146
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,700
Come on, boy!

1147
01:30:30,009 --> 01:30:31,928
Aaaaaah!

1148
01:31:22,228 --> 01:31:27,400
One Baker Eleven. Unit Three involved
in a TA at St. Vincent's and Seventh.

1149
01:32:01,851 --> 01:32:05,479
All units, pursuit has
entered flood control near 710 Freeway.

1150
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:08,524
- Where's that air unit?
- Requesting air unit same location.

1151
01:32:10,693 --> 01:32:13,487
Air One.
We're opening pursuit.

1152
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:16,699
Suspect traveling southbound
at 9O miles an hour.

1153
01:32:20,286 --> 01:32:22,705
- Stay with him, Air One!
- I'm all over him.

1154
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:35,301
- Suspect has increased speed to 120.
- Maintain visual, Air One.

1155
01:32:35,301 --> 01:32:38,554
- 140 miles an hour.
- Do not lose him!

1156
01:32:38,554 --> 01:32:41,515
This is an A-Star, sir,
not an Apache.

1157
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:44,393
150. 160.

1158
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:45,603
He's gone.

1159
01:32:45,603 --> 01:32:48,272
- God!
- Man, this guy can drive!

1160
01:32:48,272 --> 01:32:51,817
- What? What?
- It's probably mostly the car.

1161
01:32:54,278 --> 01:32:56,614
Hey, what time is it?

1162
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:00,910
7:30.

1163
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:07,124
I think I'm gonna have to
get you out of town or something.

1164
01:33:07,124 --> 01:33:08,959
Your brother's the best boost
in the world,

1165
01:33:08,959 --> 01:33:12,546
but I don't know
if he's gonna make this one.

1166
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:18,803
I'm not like my brother, you know?
I just don't abandon my friends.

1167
01:33:18,803 --> 01:33:21,597
Oh, man, I ought to
smack you silly, boy.

1168
01:33:24,308 --> 01:33:27,228
You think your brother ran away?
Is that what you think?

1169
01:33:27,228 --> 01:33:29,980
You better get your story straight.

1170
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:35,236
Well, go on then.
Straighten it out.

1171
01:33:35,236 --> 01:33:38,239
Your mother told him to go.

1172
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:42,618
She knew if Memphis stayed,
you were gonna walk his line.

1173
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:46,747
You were gonna join his crew.
And she told him to pick up and go.

1174
01:33:46,747 --> 01:33:50,835
And he did, thinking
it was best for you.

1175
01:33:50,835 --> 01:33:54,839
He left all of us... for you.

1176
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:58,592
Guess it wasn't that big a deal
for him, though, really.

1177
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:03,639
Wasn't that big a sacrifice, leaving
everything he'd ever known behind.

1178
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:08,853
And six years later, ain't life grand?
You became a car boost anyway.

1179
01:34:08,853 --> 01:34:11,105
How about that?

1180
01:34:11,105 --> 01:34:15,901
I sedated him. He's sleeping.
He's gonna be just fine.

1181
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:46,682
It's just a scratch, Eleanor.
It can be fixed.

1182
01:34:48,851 --> 01:34:51,020
No, no, no, don't.
Don't do this to me.

1183
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:53,981
Don't start with me.
Don't. No, don't do... No, no, start!

1184
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:57,693
Start, start.
Come on. Come on. Shit.

1185
01:34:59,945 --> 01:35:02,489
I need you, Eleanor.
I need you now. Now.

1186
01:35:02,489 --> 01:35:03,741
Yes!

1187
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:15,085
All units, be advised, suspect vehicle
headed south on Henry Ford Boulevard.

1188
01:35:15,085 --> 01:35:17,421
We should hit him at Ocean Avenue,
at the end of this bridge.

1189
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:21,425
- There he is. There he is!
- Yeah.

1190
01:35:21,425 --> 01:35:24,720
I got you, Raines!
I got you,boy!

1191
01:35:46,784 --> 01:35:49,912
Whoa! Shit! Shit!

1192
01:36:10,349 --> 01:36:14,270
One Baker Eleven, suspect heading
westbound. Head east to intercept.

1193
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:23,779
One Baker Eleven, maintain your course.
Suspect heading in your direction.

1194
01:36:26,907 --> 01:36:30,077
- Hey, what are you doing!
- Hang on.

1195
01:36:30,077 --> 01:36:31,704
Take it up!

1196
01:36:39,211 --> 01:36:41,964
One Baker Eleven, he's at the end
of the pier turning toward you.

1197
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:48,053
Christ! Hang on!
Hang on to it!

1198
01:37:13,162 --> 01:37:15,706
Whoa! Shit!

1199
01:37:27,885 --> 01:37:29,887
- Hey!
- Move!

1200
01:37:47,196 --> 01:37:50,240
Is he OK?

1201
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,950
- How ya doin'? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1202
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:54,161
- Are you OK? Just sit back. You all right?
- I think so.

1203
01:37:54,161 --> 01:37:57,456
Are you sure?
'Cause you just went through a wall.

1204
01:37:58,707 --> 01:38:01,877
Long Beach Tower, this is
LAPD Air One in pursuit of suspect.

1205
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:04,046
Requesting permission
to cross airfield.

1206
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:09,176
Negative, Air One. Incoming
aircraft on approach. Hold your position.

1207
01:38:10,219 --> 01:38:14,223
I repeat, do not enter
airport airspace.

1208
01:38:29,113 --> 01:38:31,532
- Ready to go.
- Yeah, Lieutenant.

1209
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:37,121
We're done. Wait up!

1210
01:38:39,415 --> 01:38:42,084
He's got a broken leg.

1211
01:39:05,566 --> 01:39:07,025
There he is. There he is!

1212
01:39:12,948 --> 01:39:14,533
Get out of the car, man!

1213
01:39:17,995 --> 01:39:19,413
Raines!

1214
01:40:07,294 --> 01:40:10,589
- Where's Memphis?
- I don't know, man.

1215
01:40:10,589 --> 01:40:13,133
He's not back yet.

1216
01:40:13,133 --> 01:40:15,052
What do you mean he's not back yet?
It's eight o'clock.

1217
01:40:21,517 --> 01:40:23,519
- Atley.
- Time's up, Atley.

1218
01:40:23,519 --> 01:40:26,438
I've got 49 cars.
That's one less than required.

1219
01:40:26,438 --> 01:40:28,815
- Bring the kid and we'll settle this.
- What kid is that?

1220
01:40:28,815 --> 01:40:33,111
Oh, you know, the Cincinnati Kid. Billy
the Kid. Which kid do you think I mean?

1221
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:35,656
Oh, gee, I don't know.
I think that maybe you mean Kip Raines.

1222
01:40:35,656 --> 01:40:37,699
Well, gee, I think you're right.

1223
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:42,829
Yeah, well, you know, it's a funny thing.
The little son of a bitch evaded me.

1224
01:40:42,829 --> 01:40:46,166
- Find him, Atley.
- Well, what if I can't find him?

1225
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:49,253
Then big brother takes the fall for
the slip-up. Doesn't matter much to me.

1226
01:40:49,253 --> 01:40:54,424
One Raines is as good as another.
It never rains but it pours.

1227
01:40:54,424 --> 01:40:58,595
Son of a... Well, you know,
I think you can thank your big brother.

1228
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:02,391
I think he just took your place
under the guillotine.

1229
01:41:12,693 --> 01:41:14,778
Sorry, mate.
We're all done here.

1230
01:41:14,778 --> 01:41:17,781
- No, we're not done. This is number 50.
- You're late.

1231
01:41:17,781 --> 01:41:23,161
So sod off. You got a problem with that,
take it up with Calitri.

1232
01:41:41,346 --> 01:41:43,682
- You're late.
- Wait, wait.

1233
01:41:43,682 --> 01:41:47,227
You're gonna argue with me
over 12 minutes?

1234
01:41:47,227 --> 01:41:50,355
I just stole 50 cars for you
in one night, all right?

1235
01:41:50,355 --> 01:41:55,569
I'm a little tired, I'm a little wired, and
I think I deserve a little appreciation.

1236
01:41:55,569 --> 01:41:58,322
I said 50 cars, not 49 and a half.

1237
01:41:58,322 --> 01:42:00,532
49 and a half?
She's not so bad, man.

1238
01:42:00,532 --> 01:42:03,619
She's got, what, you know, a lit...
some paint and...

1239
01:42:05,537 --> 01:42:08,206
You know, some fiberglass.
Yes, indeedy.

1240
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:11,752
You know, and the book on her
is 60, 70. Call it 80.

1241
01:42:11,752 --> 01:42:15,505
So you take 80, all right?
You subtract it from 200.

1242
01:42:15,505 --> 01:42:20,761
All right? And we make a deal.
You take 80 from 200 and we call it even.

1243
01:42:20,761 --> 01:42:22,596
Done.

1244
01:42:22,596 --> 01:42:25,641
All right. Good.
And this thing with my brother is over.

1245
01:42:25,641 --> 01:42:27,809
It's over.

1246
01:42:27,809 --> 01:42:30,062
It's done. It's finished.

1247
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:33,440
Done. Finished.

1248
01:42:40,364 --> 01:42:44,409
Nobody insults me.
Nobody puts a gun to me head.

1249
01:42:46,703 --> 01:42:49,414
Kill him. Shred the car.

1250
01:42:58,799 --> 01:43:03,428
All right.
Where's Raymond Calitri's place?

1251
01:43:03,428 --> 01:43:06,098
Exeter Salvage and Steel.
It's on the water. Why? Are we goin'?

1252
01:43:06,098 --> 01:43:08,725
Because, you know, Homicide specifically
ordered us not to interfere.

1253
01:43:08,725 --> 01:43:11,061
To hell with Homicide.

1254
01:43:27,202 --> 01:43:30,580
- Unicorn.
- What?

1255
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:32,749
Nothing.

1256
01:43:36,253 --> 01:43:39,089
So, where would you like it, sir?

1257
01:43:39,089 --> 01:43:41,591
In the head, or in the chest?

1258
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:45,178
- The chest.
- My pleasure.

1259
01:43:45,178 --> 01:43:48,557
Hey, wait a minute, fellas. Hold it.
Big change of plan here.

1260
01:43:48,557 --> 01:43:52,227
- That's far enough, Atley.
- What are you doing? No, no, no!

1261
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:54,479
I said stop there, Atley.

1262
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:58,316
No, no. Calitri just sent me
up here to ask you a question.

1263
01:43:58,316 --> 01:43:59,526
Shit!

1264
01:44:07,993 --> 01:44:10,078
All right? Everything's gonna
be all right. We got it covered.

1265
01:44:10,078 --> 01:44:12,289
Get my brother out of here.

1266
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:16,376
Hey.

1267
01:44:17,919 --> 01:44:22,299
You made a mistake picking a kid
to do your dirty work.

1268
01:44:22,299 --> 01:44:24,760
Made an even bigger mistake
picking my kid brother.

1269
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:28,555
And now you just made the biggest
mistake tryin' to kill me.

1270
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:35,312
- No. Be careful with that.
- This?

1271
01:44:35,312 --> 01:44:38,482
- Just put it down.
- That's right. You got a thing about wood.

1272
01:44:38,482 --> 01:44:40,859
Just put it down.

1273
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:42,736
No.

1274
01:44:42,736 --> 01:44:45,363
- No! No!
- I'm-I'm...

1275
01:44:45,363 --> 01:44:47,824
- No!
- Oh, no.

1276
01:45:09,304 --> 01:45:10,305
Go!

1277
01:45:28,782 --> 01:45:30,742
Psst.

1278
01:45:30,742 --> 01:45:31,952
I'm good.

1279
01:46:39,477 --> 01:46:40,854
God! Jesus!

1280
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:44,399
God!

1281
01:46:45,942 --> 01:46:48,987
- Who are you?
- I'm a police officer.

1282
01:46:48,987 --> 01:46:51,406
- Hey, you don't wanna do that now.
- Yeah, I do.

1283
01:46:51,406 --> 01:46:54,910
Listen to me. You walk out of here
with me, you got some options.

1284
01:46:54,910 --> 01:46:57,078
You kill me... now,
you think about this...

1285
01:46:57,078 --> 01:46:59,748
I'm a police officer,
your life will be over.

1286
01:46:59,748 --> 01:47:03,335
No, you've got that the wrong way round.
If I kill you your life's over.

1287
01:47:03,335 --> 01:47:05,879
Not all bad, though.
Funeral will be on the telly.

1288
01:47:05,879 --> 01:47:08,882
Everybody out there pressed
and dressed. Guard of honor.

1289
01:47:08,882 --> 01:47:13,637
Twenty-one-gun salute and the Stars
and Stripes draped all over your coffin.

1290
01:47:13,637 --> 01:47:15,805
It'll be the greatest
day of your life.

1291
01:47:46,378 --> 01:47:49,673
Here I am smack-dab in the middle
of a moral dilemma, Randall.

1292
01:47:49,673 --> 01:47:52,968
You've torn this town to shreds
with that little escapade of yours,

1293
01:47:52,968 --> 01:47:54,427
you and your Eleanor.

1294
01:47:54,427 --> 01:47:58,515
But I understand
what brought you back here.

1295
01:47:58,515 --> 01:48:02,519
A brother's love is a brother's love.

1296
01:48:05,355 --> 01:48:07,983
You saved my life, didn't you?

1297
01:48:07,983 --> 01:48:12,737
- So what am I gonna do?
- It's your call, Detective.

1298
01:48:14,447 --> 01:48:18,284
Get outta here, Randall.
I'll clean this up.

1299
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:24,624
Go, Randall, before
I change my mind. Go.

1300
01:48:27,293 --> 01:48:31,840
Oh, there's a container ship
at pier 14.

1301
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,925
You might wanna check it out.

1302
01:48:43,643 --> 01:48:46,021
Oh!

1303
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:49,107
Can a good-lookin', hard-workin'
chef get a beer around here?

1304
01:48:49,107 --> 01:48:53,111
Come on, Tumbler. You ain't doin'
nothin'. Hand me a beer, baby.

1305
01:48:53,111 --> 01:48:56,489
All right. Memphis?
Guys? Food!

1306
01:48:56,489 --> 01:48:58,241
- Thank you, sir.
- Damn.

1307
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:01,619
Ow. Ow.

1308
01:49:01,619 --> 01:49:05,832
Poor Toby, man.
Sure looks like he's in a lot of pain.

1309
01:49:05,832 --> 01:49:09,002
Hey, if that's pain,
you can shoot me anytime.

1310
01:49:09,002 --> 01:49:11,212
Sexy, sassy.

1311
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:16,926
If his unpleasant wounding has in
some way enlightened the rest of you

1312
01:49:16,926 --> 01:49:20,680
as to the grim finish below
the glossy veneer of criminal life,

1313
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,016
and inspired you to change your ways,

1314
01:49:23,016 --> 01:49:26,519
then his injuries carry with it
an inherent nobility

1315
01:49:26,519 --> 01:49:28,813
and a supreme glory.

1316
01:49:28,813 --> 01:49:30,857
We should all be so fortunate.

1317
01:49:30,857 --> 01:49:34,277
You say, "Poor Toby."

1318
01:49:34,277 --> 01:49:37,072
I say, "Poor us."

1319
01:49:38,114 --> 01:49:40,200
- He spoke.
- Yeah.

1320
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,202
Hey, man, I thought
you were from Long Beach.

1321
01:49:44,829 --> 01:49:47,499
Memphis. Hey.

1322
01:49:50,168 --> 01:49:52,837
- I have something for you.
- What is this?

1323
01:49:52,837 --> 01:49:54,506
Open it.

1324
01:49:56,049 --> 01:49:59,844
Keys. Keys are good.
What do I do with them?

1325
01:49:59,844 --> 01:50:03,765
Hey, everybody.
Everybody, inside here. Let's go.

1326
01:50:03,765 --> 01:50:05,934
Everybody, come on.
Let's go!

1327
01:50:05,934 --> 01:50:09,729
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my great pleasure...

1328
01:50:11,022 --> 01:50:13,149
to present...

1329
01:50:13,149 --> 01:50:15,110
- Oh, man!
- Your very own Eleanor.

1330
01:50:15,110 --> 01:50:19,781
- What? What? It's Eleanor!
- Look at his face.

1331
01:50:19,781 --> 01:50:22,742
All yours.

1332
01:50:22,742 --> 01:50:27,247
It's a heap, but give me a couple of weeks
and it'll look like a streamlined butterfly.

1333
01:50:31,626 --> 01:50:34,170
- You didn't...?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1334
01:50:34,170 --> 01:50:37,006
I parted the chopper out for that.

1335
01:50:37,966 --> 01:50:40,218
I'm blown away.

1336
01:50:40,218 --> 01:50:42,637
You bought me a car.

1337
01:50:42,637 --> 01:50:45,140
Well, yeah, you know,
it's just a token of my appreciation

1338
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:48,852
for everything, you know.

1339
01:50:52,397 --> 01:50:53,898
That's the way it should be.

1340
01:50:53,898 --> 01:50:56,234
That's the way it should be.
That's right.

1341
01:50:58,945 --> 01:51:00,530
Yeah.

1342
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:02,740
Why don't you get in there
and go for a ride?

1343
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:05,326
I know what you did.

1344
01:51:05,326 --> 01:51:08,872
- And thank you.
- I'll see you later, man.

1345
01:51:12,959 --> 01:51:14,961
All right.

1346
01:51:16,838 --> 01:51:18,631
Yes!

1347
01:51:20,842 --> 01:51:23,678
- You wanna go for a ride?
- Hell, yes.

1348
01:51:46,075 --> 01:51:47,785
Oh, don't do this to me.

1349
01:54:29,447 --> 01:54:31,449
Whoo!

1349
01:54:32,305 --> 01:55:32,808

2
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,279
All aboard!

3
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,352
All right, let's go.

4
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,314
That's my main man Pierce
coming back from the war!

5
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,469
Thank you! Thank you, man.

6
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,632
Hey, what's happening, Jack?

7
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,279
Private party.

8
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,232
Pick another card.

9
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,673
There you go!

10
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,077
Oh, I see what you're saying.

11
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,672
There we go!

12
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,271
Damn it! Give me that shit.

13
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,238
Party's over!

14
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,873
Here we go. Move on out.

15
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,474
Move on out.
Step out! Step out!

16
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,756
Everybody out! Out!

17
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Let's go!

18
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,550
I know you can hear me.
Get the fuck up and go!

19
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,040
I don't care what you
do during the week. Get out!

20
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,109
Party's over!
Let's get it moving!

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,713
You know how this works!

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Says who?

23
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,675
I'm sorry?

24
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,352
Man, take a hike!

25
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,556
Come in here
smelling like pig juice!

26
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,109
Excuse me, miss.
Thank you so much.

27
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,456
What'd you say?

28
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,118
I ain't said anybody
talking... Hey, man!

29
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,873
Come on, man! Let me go, man!
Let me go!

30
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,912
Hold on a second.

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,072
Get the fuck out!
Get out! Get out!

32
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,438
How many times
you want me to say it?

33
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,919
You're moving slow!

34
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,833
Come on, man!

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,638
Motherfuckers, man!

36
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,391
Look, Frank, man.
The owner split.

37
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,913
Man, I'm sorry,
but you got a room

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,718
full of open warrants
in there. All right?

39
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,991
Just make sure you search
the women, you lazy bastard.

40
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,912
All right. Watch your eyes.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, shit!

42
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,271
You know
that's not right, brother!

43
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,429
No, no, no!

44
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,919
We gotta go
through the front.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,468
What? You wanna take these
guys out in public, Sarge?

46
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,437
We have no fucking option.

47
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,953
Go tell them. Run.
All right.

48
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,030
You dirty pig!
Get the fuck out of here.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,149
Anybody else?

50
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,754
Why're we not moving?
You wanna go next?

51
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,193
Out, out, out!

52
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,936
All right,
party's over, folks. Let's go!

53
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,439
You heard him.
Time to move out!

54
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,272
Put your drinks down
and step out the door.

55
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,776
I do not understand,
I thought I was very clear!

56
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,199
Let's go! Come on!

57
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,599
Out of here! Let's go!
Come on!

58
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,696
Congratulations.

59
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,950
Get the fuck out! How many times
I gotta say "Move out"?

60
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,439
Let's go!

61
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,795
I know your black asses
is faster than that.

62
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,949
Go!

63
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,236
Let's move! Come on!
Move! Let's go!

64
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,991
On your feet!
Move it! Let's go!

65
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,198
We're taking them out front.

66
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,713
Out the front door!
Let's go! Now!

67
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,840
Taking them out the front.

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,393
Shit!

69
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Out the front!

70
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,836
Guys, sir, both sides.

71
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,354
Up against
the wall. Against the wall.

72
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,919
Let's move it. Come on.

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Let's go!

74
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,910
Here we go. Squad's here.

75
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,155
If they're not resisting,
don't push them.

76
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,919
Put it right there.

77
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,920
Right here against the wall.

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,554
Welcome home!

79
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,675
Thank you, sir.

80
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,557
Get out the way.
Get out the way!

81
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,512
Hands where we can see them.

82
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,192
We had to use the front door.

83
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,590
Shit!
Make it a public display.

84
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,599
I almost feel bad for them.

85
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,951
We gotta get out of here.
Quickly.

86
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,589
Let's go! Get them in!

87
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,040
All right! Start
loading them up! Let's go!

88
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,949
Okay, let's go!

89
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,359
Look at this shit!

90
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,550
Let's hurry!
Get it out of here!

91
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,108
Get it out! Let's go!

92
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,917
Make sure we get
those guys at the back.

93
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,752
What are you doing down here
all the time?

94
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,456
We gotta get this moving!

95
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,549
Stop messing with us.

96
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,868
These people
didn't do a thing.

97
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,234
Where's the other one?

98
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,072
It should be here any minute.

99
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,309
What did they do?

100
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,158
Please calm down!
Everything's fine.

101
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,834
Finally!

102
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Over here.

103
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,469
This is our neighborhood
and here y'all come.

104
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,829
That's not necessary.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,149
Open the door! Get them in!

106
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,839
Arrests for
a private gathering?

107
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,359
That's police overreach!

108
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,590
You got no liquor license
on this place.

109
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,238
Get the fuck out of my face.

110
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,675
Let's just keep it calm.
Are you fucking kidding me?

111
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,637
Come on! Get in
the damn van! Step in there!

112
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,515
Move, let's go!

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,877
Let's get them moving,
gentlemen!

114
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,952
Let's go!
Get them in the wagon!

115
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,038
Hey, Dave! Told you you'd
get busted, you alcoholic!

116
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,713
Oh, the night's not over!

117
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,679
Go home!
Go home!

118
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,989
Go home!

119
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,388
You go home!

120
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,480
- Get them in.
- Last one.

121
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,874
Get them in!

122
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,519
You punk-ass
motherfuckers!

123
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,856
Let's go, get in!

124
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,233
Don't touch me!

125
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,233
Let's go! In!

126
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,719
I'm moving!

127
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,558
Get in! Let's go!

128
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,758
Get in the car! Let's go!

129
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,838
Check this, motherfuckers!

130
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,111
Bub, can't even
ride that bike!

131
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,641
You know good and well you don't
know how to ride no bike.

132
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,432
Do it, man! Throw it!

133
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,794
Catch this!

134
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,950
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about!

135
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,277
It's show time now!

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,296
Destroyers
striking from as far as three miles

137
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,754
away from this
west side ghetto,

138
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,149
where it all began
early this morning

139
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,515
with a police raid on an
after-hours drinking parlor.

140
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,150
There have been
some reports of gunfire.

141
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,595
Police are under orders
not to fire.

142
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,592
More than 200 looters
have been arrested so far.

143
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,910
Police officials say they
do not have enough men

144
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,433
to worry much
about the looters.

145
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,670
They are there
to protect the firemen.

146
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,357
But that is
why you elected me.

147
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,188
To bring about change.

148
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,959
But during this time,

149
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,277
it's important that
we all settle down.

150
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,030
- Settle yourself!
- I know you're angry.

151
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,599
I'm angry, too.

152
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,797
This city has problems,
especially with the policemen.

153
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,949
We have problems.

154
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,033
However,

155
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,511
change doesn't
happen overnight.

156
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,109
But change is coming.

157
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,349
Let's work together!

158
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,874
Nah! Bring Stokely Carmichael
down here!

159
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,792
We don't wanna hear
from your ass!

160
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,032
Look here.
This is what I need you to do!

161
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,510
I need you to not mess up
your own neighborhood.

162
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,238
This is your home!

163
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,549
Yeah, burn it down!

164
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,711
Burning it down
is not the answer!

165
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,675
Burn it down! Burn it down!

166
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,313
Settle down! Settle down!

167
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,509
Hoses up! Hoses up!

168
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,711
Get that engine
in a little closer!

169
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,032
Engine four, let's relay!

170
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,509
Come on! Roll it back!
You gotta roll it back.

171
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,718
We gonna let
this motherfucker burn!

172
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,355
What the fuck!

173
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's move back! Come on!

174
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,679
Get out of here!

175
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,576
At the
request of Mayor Cavanaugh,

176
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,669
we've made state police

177
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,193
and National
Guardsmen available

178
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,590
to assist in dealing
with what is a case

179
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,870
of lawlessness and hoodlumism

180
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,349
and to protect
the persons and property

181
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,795
of people
in the areas involved.

182
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,351
Here in Detroit, a city of war

183
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,038
where snipers
hide on rooftops,

184
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,473
the violence continues.

185
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
US Army paratroopers,

186
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,710
National Guardsmen,
state and local police

187
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,712
are continuing the fight
against a handful of snipers.

188
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,396
On the city's west side, a 150-block
area is off-limits to everybody.

189
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,234
This is no man's land, an area
of destruction and devastation.

190
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,231
ABC newsman Tom Mclntyre says

191
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,550
it's hard to believe that this
could happen in America.

192
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,791
But here it is, in Detroit,
the nation's fifth largest city.

193
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,559
I am declaring
a public state of emergency.

194
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,758
And I am also indicating
that I will promulgate

195
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,276
such rules,
orders and regulations

196
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,472
as I deem necessary
to protect life and property.

197
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,592
Second unit,
left lane!

198
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,795
18-40!

199
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,633
Rally point! Rally point A!

200
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,270
Sniper in the window!

201
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,639
Third floor window!

202
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,551
Move to cover!
Move to cover now!

203
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,835
Stand by! Hold your fire!

204
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,190
Don't move!
All right, he's clear.

205
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,719
Move back!

206
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Hey!

207
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,152
Oh, I almost hit that one.

208
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,509
There is no American right

209
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,158
to loot stores

210
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,113
or to burn buildings,

211
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,395
or to fire rifles
from the rooftops.

212
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,599
That is crime.

213
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,959
And crime must be
dealt with forcefully

214
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,194
and swiftly,
and certainly under law.

215
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,696
...LBJ tell you

216
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,676
that, "Violence never
accomplishes anything,

217
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,216
"my fellow Americans."

218
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,674
Don't you see,
the real problem with violence

219
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,354
is that we have
never been violent.

220
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,873
We have been too nonviolent!

221
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,397
Excuse me!

222
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,551
Go back
the way you came!

223
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,296
I need to go down this road
to get to work.

224
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,878
What did I say? Back!

225
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,315
I need to go down this road
to get to work, Ford Assembly.

226
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,913
Hold on! Where you going?

227
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,758
Hey! Let him go!

228
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,998
You cannot go this...

229
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Take cover!
We might have a sniper on...

230
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,277
Boy, would you look at this.

231
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,313
So sad.

232
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,469
It's preventable, you know.
That's the worst part.

233
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
Look at this.
This looks like fucking 'Nam.

234
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,833
You believe this is the USA?

235
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,319
And we're to blame.

236
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,309
By standing by,
the trouble started. Now this.

237
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,511
What can you do with this?

238
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,589
They're crazy.

239
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,991
They're not crazy. They know
exactly what they're doing.

240
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,111
This is gonna
be worse than '43.

241
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,440
No, we need to stop
failing these people.

242
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,016
They're looking to us, and
we keep letting them down

243
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,155
left, right, and center.

244
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,438
Take this motherfucker
right here. Halt!

245
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,359
Halt!

246
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,675
Halt!

247
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,199
Get back!

248
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,016
- Stay off the street!
- Halt!

249
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Back up!

250
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Hey!

251
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,549
Come here!

252
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,835
Get back off the street!

253
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,553
Hey, Phil! Come on!

254
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,915
Hey, Phil!
Forget him! Come on!

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,149
Fuck!

256
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,155
You're not supposed to
shoot the looters anyway.

257
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,073
Yeah.

258
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,549
How the hell
are we supposed to stop them?

259
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,750
What a fucking specimen, huh?

260
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,588
Confound it!

261
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,354
What... What are you doing
under there?

262
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,080
I just live down the street.

263
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,028
If you can go
get my wife Roberta?

264
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,156
You want me to
call the ambulance?

265
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,719
No, no police!

266
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,552
Just, please, Roberta.

267
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,789
Goodness!

268
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,473
Get me Roberta.

269
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,795
1,100 National Guardsmen

270
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,393
have been rushed
into as many areas

271
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,869
as they can cover,
protecting police.

272
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,474
Looters carry off thousands
of dollars' worth of goods

273
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,670
with a gay sort of leisure.

274
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,069
Many negro shop owners
put up signs

275
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,549
reading "Soul Brother"
to avoid damage.

276
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,471
But the fire bombers
and looters

277
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,675
are indiscriminate.

278
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,856
Just cuff him to the chair.

279
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,976
I'll get to him
when I get a second.

280
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,616
Write your address
and your date of birth.

281
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,834
Talk to him!

282
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,120
Where am I supposed
to put him?

283
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,912
I don't care. Take him
to your house!

284
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,296
Let's move
these negroes out of here!

285
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,469
There's no room!

286
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,669
Sergeant!

287
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,591
Homicide detectives
wanna have a word with you.

288
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,736
Quit pushing! You got room

289
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,079
for two more
in holding or not?

290
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,958
Step back from
the goddamn counter!

291
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,680
Come on, move!
Behind the door!

292
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,671
Hey! Whose prisoner is this?

293
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,638
Don't talk to me!

294
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,679
For God's sake.

295
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,960
Sit the fuck down
and shut up!

296
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,840
Krauss, in here. I need you.

297
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,514
Go, come on.

298
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,033
Guys, come on. Out.

299
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,079
I got a young black,

300
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,720
shotgunned in the vicinity
of Virginia Park.

301
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,357
Did I hear earlier
you shot a black guy?

302
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,556
I missed, called it in.

303
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,713
You missed?

304
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,791
I might've clipped him.
He was real fast.

305
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,668
Sit down, patrolman. Sit down.

306
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,158
What's the hold up?

307
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,256
Schools, city offices

308
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,350
and many stores remain
closed today in Detroit,

309
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,113
and a 9:00 p.m. curfew has
been ordered for this evening.

310
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,715
Hey, Ma.

311
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,835
Hey.

312
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,079
I got it.

313
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,915
Hello.

314
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,753
No, I'm off.

315
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,112
I worked a double.

316
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,157
Okay. All right.

317
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,668
What? Back to work?

318
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,512
Yeah, Mr. LeFrank called.

319
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,238
I thought Vinny
was your boss.

320
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,356
I got two jobs,
two bosses, Ma.

321
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,670
Security company needs me
for the looting.

322
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,110
Looting?
Yeah, watch the news.

323
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,872
Nowhere to run to, baby

324
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,471
Nowhere to hide

325
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,395
Got nowhere
to run to, baby

326
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,519
Nowhere to hide

327
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,397
It's not love
I'm running from

328
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,151
It's the heartbreak
I know will come

329
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,673
What do you say there, Fred?
Hey.

330
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,875
Yo, you're late.

331
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,616
Listen, I almost lost my job
getting here. I'm sorry.

332
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,551
I don't give a damn
about Ford Motor Company.

333
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,216
Bumper cars and sheet metal
motherfucker?

334
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
You about to be
with the stars!

335
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,675
But I need to
buy bread, negro.

336
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,154
Listen, it's gonna be good.

337
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,915
You sure?

338
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah.

339
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
All right?

340
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,672
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

341
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,831
I need you here, man.
I'm here!

342
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,150
What you need?
Water or something?

343
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,918
I know
you're no good for me

344
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,910
But you've
become a part of me

345
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,229
Is that A&R man out there?

346
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,393
Yeah, he out there, waiting
to get his mind blown, baby.

347
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,593
When it's so deep
So deep

348
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,517
Deep inside of me

349
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,720
All right, folks, come on.

350
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,896
Let's get this together.
You ready?

351
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,035
Get these steps together.

352
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,536
Hold on. Let me get
that note one more time.

353
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,959
If you haven't got

354
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,873
Love

355
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,873
Love

356
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,112
A traveling man
once told me

357
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,191
That he didn't ever care

358
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,793
Watch your spacing.

359
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,715
That any time
he wants to go

360
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,914
That he go anywhere

361
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,710
If you haven't got love
Love believe me

362
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,551
The traveling man
once told me

363
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,395
If you haven't got love
Love will leave me

364
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,835
Then you're lonely
So lonely

365
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,275
You're lonely
So lonely

366
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,396
You're lonely
So lonely

367
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,676
Oh, yeah
If you haven't got

368
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,275
You're up next, boys.
Let's get it! Come on!

369
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,117
It's Motown, baby.
All right. Are we ready?

370
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,559
Give it up!

371
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,793
Motown Records, baby.
Motown, we're Motown tonight.

372
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,036
All right, settle down, cats.

373
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,736
Now, I know you guys
think that we reached

374
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,796
the top of this evening
but we have not.

375
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,160
Because we're about to take
this thing to another level.

376
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,677
Because the band of brothers I'm
about to bring to this stage

377
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,588
comes straight out
of Motor City herself.

378
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,358
He talkin' about you.

379
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,190
If you would,
stand up on your feet

380
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,670
and make some noise
for Detroit's own

381
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,432
The Dramatics!

382
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,856
You got to tell these folks that
they got to go home right now.

383
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,016
These folks
is out here rioting.

384
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,268
Hold on. They're doin' what?

385
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,395
They out here rioting.

386
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,913
Right now?
Right now.

387
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,296
Tell these folks
they got to go home.

388
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,469
Excuse me.

389
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,275
We're ready, right?

390
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,616
Listen, you boys can't
go out there tonight.

391
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,816
What do you mean
we can't go out there?

392
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,896
These folks is
out here rioting.

393
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,976
You cannot go
out there tonight.

394
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,056
We're on
the schedule, brother.

395
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,840
We all gotta get the hell
out of Fox tonight.

396
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,788
Now,
ladies and gentlemen,

397
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,711
I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

398
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,680
What's going on?

399
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,672
It seems like we're all gonna
have to exit the building

400
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,176
and head to our homes.

401
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,839
Come on, just one song, man!
Motown's right there!

402
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,992
This is Detroit,
we're no stranger to this.

403
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,918
Now, the police said we have
absolutely nothing to worry about.

404
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,598
So if you would,
just grab your things.

405
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,033
Ma'am, grab your purse.

406
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,315
Slowly, slowly.

407
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,840
Exits to your left
and to your right.

408
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,796
- Damn it!
- What the hell?

409
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,878
We gotta go, boys.
We gotta go.

410
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,315
I'm going on that stage.

411
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,496
We're going on that stage,
y'all hear me?

412
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,397
People are leaving, man.
The band's leaving.

413
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,879
Ma'am, your purse.

414
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,616
We won't get
another shot like this.

415
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,640
I'm sorry.

416
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,016
We need to get
out of here, Larry.

417
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,712
Watch your step, sir!

418
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,198
Now, boys, I'm sorry.
But we've got to go.

419
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,753
I'm sorry.
All right.

420
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,879
Larry, I mean...

421
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,439
What can we do?

422
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,231
Larry, there's
nothing we can do.

423
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,236
Another day...
Another day, man.

424
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,437
Listen, I know
you want it bad, man.

425
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,914
Larry, we gotta go.

426
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
We gotta go.

427
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,074
Come on.

428
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,389
Larry!

429
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,228
Larry.

430
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,830
You might be a rich man

431
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,350
With the world on a string

432
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,515
But with all your riches

433
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,115
You haven't got everything

434
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,478
If you haven't got love

435
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,635
Love

436
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,635
If you haven't got love
Ooh, love

437
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,032
You're lonely

438
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,111
You're lonely

439
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,351
So lonely

440
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,875
Ooh, baby

441
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,398
We were so close.

442
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,475
Yeah, y'all looked good,
y'all sounded good.

443
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,477
There'll be a next time.

444
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,435
There will be.

445
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,708
Bus driver!

446
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,911
Hey, now! Bus driver!

447
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,878
Hey, y'all seeing this?

448
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,736
Clear the street.

449
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,432
Go back to your homes now.

450
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,517
Disperse
or you will be arrested.

451
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,400
I say we go up to 12th Street
and be a part of this.

452
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,717
We're working musicians, man.

453
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,896
I can't be singing
when I'm supposed to

454
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,717
be out there
swinging, brother.

455
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,360
Hey, look. We're not
too far from the Algiers.

456
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,200
Let's just go there
till all this blows over.

457
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,793
We gotta
get off this bus!

458
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,632
Everybody out! Let's go, now!

459
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,790
- Come on, man!
- Sit the fuck down!

460
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,315
I didn't do anything!

461
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,789
I'm sorry,
I've been working

462
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,871
straight shifts
since the riots started.

463
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,917
Yeah, that guy you shot at
didn't make it home.

464
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,554
Ambulance found him
bleeding out under a car.

465
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,313
Are we sure
it's the same guy?

466
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,391
He's the only
Virginia Park shooting today.

467
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,277
You carry a shotgun,
he had shotgun wounds.

468
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,998
You wanna play ballistics?

469
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,112
Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

470
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
That's it?

471
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
What else?

472
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,913
You shot him in the back.

473
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,989
Right. He was...
He was running away from me.

474
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,638
Where else do you
want me to shoot?

475
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,990
My point was him being
no threat to you.

476
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,995
In hindsight,
but I'm thinking,

477
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,176
why is he running
away from me,

478
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,792
if all he did was
steal some groceries?

479
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,112
What if he killed somebody
in that grocery store?

480
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,176
He's avoiding the police.
What do you assume from that?

481
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,349
You don't assume.

482
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,576
If he had a weapon in his
hand, that's another story.

483
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,591
We don't shoot for robberies.

484
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,275
Detective, you know it's
a war zone out there, right?

485
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,911
Yeah. 10th had to shut down.

486
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,952
They're destroying the city.

487
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,278
We're facilitating that
with the message we send,

488
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,792
which is that it's okay, go ahead,
burn down your houses,

489
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,359
rob a store.

490
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,797
It's total chaos. And...

491
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,634
Where does that lead us
long term, Detective?

492
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,712
All right, kid. Thank you.

493
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Anytime.

494
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,552
I'm recommending
murder charges.

495
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,999
You go back to work,
wait to hear from the DA.

496
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Yes, sir.

497
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
And kid...

498
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,428
Calm down out there.

499
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,388
Thank you, Detective.

500
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,795
All right?

501
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,915
Forget it.

502
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,150
Are you in trouble?
I'm fine, so forget it.

503
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,316
He's doing his job,
same as you and me.

504
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,719
Stand up. Let's go.
On your feet.

505
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,516
Go home, now! All you
people, off the streets.

506
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,192
Yo, we need to split up, man.

507
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,200
I mean, the police are
going crazy out here right now.

508
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,641
Five brothers together,
you know they gonna say we a gang.

509
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,400
Come on, man,
we're not splitting up.

510
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
Shit!

511
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,416
Where do you think
you're going?

512
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,396
We're going home, man.
Get off the street!

513
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,879
Hands on the wall!

514
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,188
- Keep them up!
- Okay!

515
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Oh, shit!

516
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,869
Keep moving!

517
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,176
What the hell
you talking about?

518
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,200
Look at this mess, man!

519
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,117
Hey, come here! You! Stop!
It's after curfew!

520
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,696
This is the Detroit Police.
There is a curfew.

521
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
We're going home!

522
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,313
Assalamu alaikum,
my brother!

523
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,536
Disperse!

524
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,312
Leave using the streets
behind you.

525
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,628
This direction!

526
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,799
This is our street!

527
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,916
Go back to your homes!

528
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,633
Go back to your homes!

529
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,536
Disperse

530
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,834
or you will be arrested.

531
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,429
Hello, hello.

532
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Hello.

533
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,909
How you doing?
Just need to get a room.

534
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,720
Y'all at the
wrong hotel, though.

535
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,758
Ritz down the street.

536
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,096
Yeah, well, the Ritz ain't got
you behind the counter, so...

537
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,873
Look, all I got
is a room in the annex

538
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,336
out back down
through the breezeway.

539
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,476
$11 a night,
you pay in advance.

540
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,834
That's cool.

541
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,711
A8, A8.

542
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,475
Voilà!

543
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,879
What you expect for 11 bucks?

544
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,955
Hey!

545
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,016
With the exception
of a few isolated snipers...

546
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,110
You know
what fucking time it is, boy?

547
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,430
- Let me have a little fun with you.
- Come on, man!

548
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,096
- What time is it?
- I ain't got no watch.

549
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,336
How am I supposed to know
what time it is?

550
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,016
It's past curfew
and you know it, Goddamn it!

551
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,456
You gonna shoot me
because I don't have a watch?

552
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,536
Get the fuck off my street!

553
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,710
What you gonna do? Shoot me?
Get off my street!

554
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
Do it! Go ahead.

555
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,016
I will kill you
right the fuck now.

556
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,314
So sorry!

557
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,034
I'm guarding that grocery store
right there. I'm guarding it.

558
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,873
This my nephew.
I'm so sorry, I apologize.

559
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,235
I'm gonna take him away.
Come on.

560
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,719
I ain't your nephew,
motherfucker!

561
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,553
Just get across the street.
Calm down.

562
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,393
They let you out, Uncle Tom?
Just get across the street.

563
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,191
Keep on walking.
Don't look back.

564
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,599
Keep on moving.

565
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,673
Dumb jacky giant,

566
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,228
I'll beat your head
to the white meat.

567
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,392
You won't kick my ass.

568
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,313
I'm a black belt in karate,
I'll whoop that ass.

569
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,470
Besides,
even if you did win,

570
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,594
those ten guys over there
would be on you

571
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,751
and behind them is 10,000.

572
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,674
Now, you smart. Go home.

573
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,839
So you the cool brother, huh?

574
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,114
Dismukes.

575
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,473
Okay, Tom.

576
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,776
This is the Detroit Police.

577
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,949
There is a curfew.

578
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,872
You cannot stay on the street.

579
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,030
What the hell was that?

580
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,153
You checked
the windows and doors?

581
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,435
I checked them already.
Check it again.

582
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,556
I don't even wanna see
graffiti back there.

583
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Hello.

584
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,111
Everything is fine.
No trouble here.

585
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,034
I'll sleep when they stop
rioting. Good night, sir.

586
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,550
Hey, hey.
Hey. Look at this.

587
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,912
Miller, with me.
Ready, Title 32? Let's do it!

588
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,308
You got it!

589
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,675
You know what?

590
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,470
I'm gonna go talk
to those white guys.

591
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,711
I'm gonna stay here,
if that's okay.

592
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,394
I'm gonna make sure they
don't start shooting at us.

593
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,319
All right, boys.

594
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,195
Relax here.

595
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,416
Hey, you sure
you want them white boys

596
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,040
to know where we are?
I'll be right back.

597
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,189
Jefferson, Wood, head
in there and take the roof.

598
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
We're on it.

599
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,919
Hey, fellas.

600
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,519
Melvin Dismukes.

601
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,075
I'm with United Security,

602
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,160
I'm guarding that grocery
store across the street.

603
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,078
I come bearing gifts.
Oh.

604
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,309
Thank you.

605
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,874
Isn't this nice, boys?

606
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,555
All things considered,
this is pretty good.

607
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,632
Thank you. I don't have
my usual appliances.

608
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,553
You got any sugar?

609
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,552
Oh, don't push it, man.

610
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,120
It's good
to have some quiet.

611
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,397
We were at Black Bottom
earlier today.

612
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,592
We actually took sniper fire.

613
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,110
Had one, right by here.

614
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,994
Ain't no snipers here, man.
Just you and me

615
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,230
and the people
partying in that motel.

616
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,955
How long do you think
this is gonna last?

617
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,319
Yeah, how long till these
negros, people, quit?

618
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,749
What do you think?

619
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,237
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

620
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,672
Is Morris home? It's Larry.

621
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,836
I can't find
those guys anywhere.

622
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,911
No, no, no. No, he's fine.

623
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,353
Just when you see that cat,
tell him to come down to the Algiers.

624
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,919
We're rehearsing.

625
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Bye.

626
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,749
No luck?

627
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,276
His mama don't even know
where he is.

628
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,273
He's probably all right.

629
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,952
Look in my eyes

630
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,872
And don't you see water?

631
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,998
And it's all
because of you

632
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,279
So look at me

633
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,271
I ain't acting like
I ought to

634
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,273
And it's all
because of you

635
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,717
So look in my eyes
And don't you see water?

636
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,030
And it's all
because of you

637
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,634
You're gonna
get back on that stage.

638
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,311
Yeah, it's not
that simple, brother.

639
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,315
Listen, when they hear
you blow... Money raining.

640
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,473
And I want a cut.

641
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,309
Look at me.

642
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,309
In the eyes.

643
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,631
I'm looking at you
in the eyes, Fred.

644
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,709
You're gonna
get a record deal.

645
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,353
All right?

646
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,832
Look in my eyes

647
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,313
The Fox Theatre

648
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,876
welcomes The Dramatics!

649
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Yeah?

650
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,194
Yeah.

651
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,034
You know what, Fred?

652
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,320
I think it's time to fix
that little problem of yours.

653
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,919
What problem?

654
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,355
I don't have a problem.
Yeah, you do. Come on.

655
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,511
We're not doing this.
Yeah, we're doing this.

656
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,800
Come on! Don't give me a no.

657
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Come on.

658
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,056
You're gonna look
in her eyes

659
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,176
I don't need it,
I don't want it.

660
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,240
And she's gonna
get you off

661
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,349
Come on.

662
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,349
Okay, no. Man,
I'm doing you a favor, okay?

663
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,189
Okay?
I'm going.

664
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
We're going.

665
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,238
Look at this
nice little scene right here.

666
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,191
There you go, Karen.
Thank you.

667
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,238
Enjoy it because
we are now officially broke.

668
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,476
There's rioting outside, and I'm
not writing to my parents again.

669
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,950
Look at this.
That right there.

670
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,520
It's perfect.

671
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,788
Larry.
What?

672
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,234
They white.

673
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,594
So, they white.

674
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,876
Beggars can't
be choosers, all right?

675
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,148
What does that mean?

676
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240
You know what I say?

677
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
What?

678
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,759
Let freedom ring.

679
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,229
I've had that freedom,
thank you very much!

680
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,799
No, you haven't.

681
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,799
Because freedom doesn't mean
giving it away for free.

682
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,998
Only you could make
prostitution sound high class.

683
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,509
Come on.

684
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,158
I'm not trying
to do this, brother.

685
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,320
Hey, stop.

686
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,840
Why won't you just
leave them alone?

687
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,592
I think those boys
are eyeballing us.

688
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,915
Okay, stop.

689
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,070
Come on, man.
Follow my lead.

690
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,990
Okay, so we do it together
and it's like a co-op.

691
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,198
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Larry Cleveland.

692
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,432
I wouldn't be interrupting a private
conversation here, would I?

693
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,272
We must be neighbors.

694
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,317
I'm Julie, Ohio.

695
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,110
Karen, Ohio.

696
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,957
No,
my last name is Cleveland.

697
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,596
We're actually from Ohio.

698
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,155
Okay, so what y'all
doing in Detroit?

699
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,470
Well, Julie here
is a professional prostitute.

700
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,511
Okay...
She's kidding!

701
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,789
I'm a hairdresser.

702
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,951
And a hoe.

703
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,037
What do you guys do?

704
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,472
I'm a singer
in The Dramatics,

705
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,551
and Fred here is my bodyguard.

706
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,755
The Dramatics?

707
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,875
Yeah.

708
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,075
Never heard of them.

709
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,315
But I love... I love Motown.

710
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,071
The Supremes are my favorite.

711
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,998
Well, if you love
The Supremes,

712
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,036
you'll definitely love
The Dramatics.

713
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,869
Larry.

714
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,913
Sing something to her.

715
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,395
Baby

716
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,993
I'm for real

717
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,149
I said I'm as real
As real can get

718
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,230
Oh, my God!
You can really sing.

719
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,269
It's who I am,
you know. I sing.

720
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,353
It's who he is.

721
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,515
We were just gonna go
get something to eat.

722
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,715
A friend of ours
is staying at the annex.

723
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,359
Would you like to join us?

724
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,832
I mean, yeah. I could eat.

725
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,234
Fred, you hungry?

726
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,951
Yeah, I can eat.

727
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Let's go.

728
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,029
Let's go.

729
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,635
How you doing?

730
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,755
Good.

731
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,799
How are you?

732
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,754
Mmm...

733
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,678
We looking good!

734
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,711
Hey, Carl!
Mmm.

735
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,959
We're starving.

736
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,456
You know I got something
for y'all to eat.

737
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,549
Okay.

738
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,438
Hey, babe.
Hey!

739
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,760
Mmm.

740
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,549
Hello!

741
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,080
Hi, guys!

742
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,549
Come on in.

743
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,954
It's a nice joint, man.

744
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,588
Sit down, man.

745
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Say what?

746
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,239
Sit down, take a seat.

747
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,749
Hey, Aubrey.

748
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,919
How you doing?

749
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,308
Hey, Karen.

750
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,519
Okay, where I grew up,
when you meet someone new,

751
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,639
you're supposed
to say "Hi, hello!"

752
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,193
"How are you?"

753
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,199
It makes them
feel comfortable.

754
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,873
Nice duds, man.

755
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,793
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.

756
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,757
We were performing earlier.

757
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Watch out.

758
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,793
Total bull.

759
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,791
This guy. Okay.

760
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,396
Food is served
right there.

761
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,075
Yeah, all right, man.

762
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,719
Hey, Julie,

763
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,075
the air conditioning's
real nice over here.

764
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,315
Real nice, huh?

765
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,158
Mmm-hmm.
The bed's comfortable, too.

766
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,150
Yeah, that's nice.
Yeah?

767
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,956
Maybe roll up
one of these joints.

768
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,149
Aubrey, man,
turn that radio up.

769
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,709
Come on, fellas, please.

770
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,120
Can we please let Trane speak?

771
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,158
What the hell?

772
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,313
That's beautiful.

773
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,711
So sad that he died.

774
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,478
He was young, right?

775
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,640
He was 40.

776
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,914
But he used his years.

777
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,280
Let me tell you,
that man lived.

778
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,198
Unfortunately, it was heroin.

779
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,909
Now, we know Trane
did not overdose.

780
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,839
Don't put a rumor
on that, man.

781
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,991
I didn't say Trane overdosed.

782
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,435
But John Coltrane was a junkie
for years.

783
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,195
Love Supreme Trane
was high on dope.

784
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,856
I'm not saying
that's taking anything away

785
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,136
from the man
as a spiritual example.

786
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,559
He's one of my many saints.

787
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,273
But heroin
is what killed his liver.

788
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,710
I heard the FBI poisoned him.

789
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,518
FBI. You wanna know
how I know?

790
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,750
John Coltrane's wife
is a Detroit musician,

791
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,274
same set as me.

792
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,000
Oh, so now you a trained
expert on Coltrane?

793
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,031
Continuing coverage tonight

794
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,792
of the rioting
here in Detroit.

795
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,111
The National Guard
has been called in

796
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,239
and more than 3,200 people have
been arrested, most of them negros.

797
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,755
Updates will continue
throughout our broadcast...

798
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,671
Why is everything
always so violent?

799
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,278
You ask your people that?

800
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,630
Try a little revolution
with the English,

801
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,598
all that "liberty or death"?

802
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,955
That ain't
so non-violent at all.

803
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,753
Man, she from Ohio.

804
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,230
I highly doubt she understands your
logic about liberty and death.

805
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,696
Well, let's put it
in layman's terms.

806
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,994
Slide over, stripes.

807
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,640
You see,

808
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,153
you white, ain't you?

809
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,395
Brother.

810
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,595
You white, right?

811
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,160
See, y'all don't
have to deal with

812
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,640
the police nearly
as much as we do.

813
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,472
Unless, of course,
you're some

814
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,955
Uncle Tom handkerchief head,
you know?

815
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,976
It's like... When you're
black, it's almost like

816
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,150
having a gun pointing
right at your face.

817
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,634
You understand that?

818
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's like this.

819
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,992
Hey, boy!
Get your hands off my plate.

820
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,317
Put the hot dog...
Step away from the mustard!

821
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,109
Put your hands down!
Don't... You nervous?

822
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,675
- You're making me nervous!
- You got a gun on me.

823
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,115
This like police brutality
or something, man.

824
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,919
Oh. Oh... So you gonna tell me
how to do my job now?

825
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,156
I'm not... So now you're
the police officer

826
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,231
that tells me how to do my job
on my street?

827
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,117
What you doing
on my street, nigger?

828
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,193
See, that's the way they like
to express themselves.

829
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,471
You know, "My street,
my house, my car."

830
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,336
That way they can take
everything from you.

831
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,873
Larry.
So again.

832
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,715
What you doing
on my street, boy?

833
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,677
Did I do something
wrong, officer?

834
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,791
Did you do something wrong?

835
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,869
I ought to blow
your head right off.

836
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,038
Get that gun off me, man.

837
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,791
Or what, boy?
I said, get that gun off...

838
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,720
Oh, my God!

839
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,308
Oh, my God!
You shot him! Carl!

840
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,714
Lee!

841
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,240
He shouldn't
have made a move.

842
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,120
Lee?

843
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,913
Hot dog, please!

844
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,399
- You're nuts!
- What?

845
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,912
- Oh, man!
- You're nuts!

846
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,829
You're nuts!

847
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,115
It was just a starter pistol.
It just starts races.

848
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
It don't kill nobody,

849
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,600
- it don't hurt nobody.
- Crazy!

850
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,754
I'm just demonstrating
white power.

851
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,353
So am I, honey.

852
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,114
Sweetheart, baby,
it was just a joke.

853
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,352
Y'all can go
and get the hell out,

854
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,192
you and your partner.

855
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,032
Thought they could
take a joke.

856
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,919
I'm performing.

857
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,591
Sorry, Larry,
they're usually nice guys.

858
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,950
No, come on. Don't let
those fools bother you.

859
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,634
Why don't we all go to my room
and relax for a little bit?

860
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,631
We told a friend
we'd drop by.

861
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,955
Maybe later.

862
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,709
Come on.

863
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,638
Find me later.

864
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,269
See you!

865
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,913
I thought
everybody should know.

866
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,136
But you scared them off, man.

867
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,718
But Karen though...

868
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,233
She was looking at me.

869
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,629
Karen wasn't looking at you.
Karen was feeling me, man.

870
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,672
She was like, "Hey, Aubrey!"
I was like, "Hey, Karen!"

871
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,433
Disperse or you will be arrested.

872
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,309
Julie!

873
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,989
We should teach
these pigs a lesson.

874
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,278
What you
talking about, Carl?

875
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,598
Them right down there.

876
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,976
You know
if you shoot them,

877
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,360
they're gonna
shoot us back, right?

878
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,680
How they gonna know
where it came from, Lee?

879
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,256
It's not even possible.
Just calm down, man.

880
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,280
Man, you chicken.

881
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,496
It's already crazy
in here enough.

882
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,238
Look.
They need to understand

883
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,816
that they can't be picking
on us all the time.

884
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,936
Y'all gotta be
with the program!

885
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,056
We're gonna
get our asses beat!

886
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,080
One, two.

887
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,160
Would you...

888
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,191
Get down! Hit the deck!

889
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,435
You guys okay?

890
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,120
Who's shooting?
From down there, maybe?

891
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,320
It could be
any one of those buildings.

892
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,158
Did you just hear
that gunshot, baby?

893
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,197
No, I didn't hear anything.

894
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,955
Anyway, you know
if I get a record deal,

895
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,320
we gonna drive
a Cadillac, right?

896
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,198
Look, check him out!

897
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,879
Run, Mr. Cracker, run!

898
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,675
Get down!

899
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,875
Muzzle flash!

900
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,713
By the Algiers,
could be a sniper.

901
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,118
Mike?
I'm okay!

902
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,872
I didn't get hit!

903
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,440
Keifer Command, this is
Warrant Officer Roberts.

904
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,480
Take cover!

905
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,696
Army taking sniper fire.

906
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,154
Algiers Motel vicinity,
on Virginia Park.

907
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,033
Yeah, keep running.

908
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,840
- That was bad, brother.
- That's crazy, man.

909
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,040
Now everybody know
what it's like to be black.

910
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,016
Police 2-4, potential sniper

911
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,200
in the area.
Army taking fire.

912
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,912
Near the Algiers Motel

913
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,871
on Virginia Park.
Sniper on the roof.

914
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,759
Sniper fire, sniper fire,
Virginia Park.

915
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,911
Sniper
fire near the Algiers Motel.

916
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,433
10-4, on the way.

917
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,233
Shots fired,
Virginia Park, sniper on the roof.

918
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,112
Sniper out there!

919
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,079
Lock the whole place up!

920
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,432
Let's find that motherfucker.

921
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,800
Anyway, my boy Fred
was just telling me

922
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,216
that the rioting
is getting so bad,

923
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,913
even Ford's thinking about
shutting down assembly for a day.

924
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,229
Larry, that's terrible.

925
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,440
Yeah, I know it is.

926
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,238
Maybe we should
make the most of it.

927
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,198
In a time of hate, love does
become more important.

928
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,952
Maybe the most important.

929
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,616
Why don't you come over here
and visit me?

930
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,936
We got a swimming pool
and I think

931
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,791
we need to spend
some time together.

932
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,389
My mom says
I can't leave the house.

933
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,913
But I want to.

934
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,556
Your mama, right.

935
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,536
- Give me some shells.
- Here.

936
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,629
Thanks.

937
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,136
Move, move, move!
Move forward!

938
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,158
Left hand, top window!

939
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,560
Spread out to the side!

940
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,674
Hey, y'all, there's a bunch
of police outside right now.

941
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,509
Quit playing, man!

942
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,591
Why would I be playing?

943
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,193
Yo, is they lost?

944
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,400
Come on, move!

945
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,277
I hope so!
What you mean? I don't know.

946
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,496
I don't know, man,
but it look like

947
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,776
they coming
right toward the house.

948
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,360
Go! Don't just
stand there! Move up!

949
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,349
Get in position!

950
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,518
- Close the windows!
- Window!

951
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,154
Hide everything!
Turn the lights off!

952
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,320
Sniper!

953
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,119
Oh, shit!

954
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,176
Baby,
did you hear that?

955
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,394
They're shooting at us!

956
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,233
I gotta go!
They're shooting us.

957
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,875
Larry!

958
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,075
Fred, you good?

959
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,760
You good?

960
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,233
I don't wanna die, man!

961
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,616
We gotta get out of here!

962
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,376
- Man, don't get up!
- Carl, stay down!

963
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,391
- They can't do this to us.
- Stay down!

964
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,913
They can't do this to us.

965
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,160
- Carl, stay down!
- What're you doing, man?

966
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,720
Here we go!

967
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,228
Go. Go. Go. Go.

968
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,111
Going up.

969
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,960
Clear!

970
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,114
Clear!

971
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,949
Police!

972
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,708
Hey, do you hear that?

973
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,473
Fred, stay low!

974
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,068
Police! Get on the floor!

975
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,720
Get the fuck
against the wall right now!

976
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,155
All right, all right!

977
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,548
I didn't do nothing!

978
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,976
Have you got a weapon?

979
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,136
I don't have
a fucking gun!

980
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,680
Put your hands
behind your back!

981
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,239
Have you got a firearm?
No!

982
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,753
Have you got a fucking weapon?

983
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,919
Go, go, go!

984
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,600
Come here! Come on!
Why you doing this?

985
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,476
Get him the fuck
downstairs now.

986
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,016
- Get the fuck out of here now!
- Get out of here!

987
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,320
- Come on!
- Take him!

988
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,792
Put your hands on your head
and relax. Just calm down.

989
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,349
Sit down.
Put your hands on your head.

990
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,397
Move the fuck downstairs! Go!

991
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,199
I don't have a gun!
Don't pull, man!

992
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,357
Police! Put your hands
on your head!

993
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,355
They already are.

994
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,833
Against the walls and doors!

995
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,200
All of them! Against the wall!

996
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,309
Fred!

997
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,755
Walls and doors!

998
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,399
I didn't do nothing!

999
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,073
I don't have nothing!

1000
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,432
I don't got no gun!

1001
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,034
Anybody in there?

1002
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,349
No, sir.

1003
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,078
Get the fuck up! Get up!

1004
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,280
Get downstairs! Go!

1005
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,920
Get him downstairs!
What's going...

1006
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,759
What're you doing here?

1007
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,600
Down on
the ground! Get down!

1008
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,110
- I'm not resisting!
- Get up!

1009
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,559
Yeah, keep goin'!
Don't look at me!

1010
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,600
Against the wall,
bring them all down!

1011
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,878
Hey! You got him?

1012
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,616
Against
the walls and doors!

1013
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,456
Turn around
and stay against the wall.

1014
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,118
Let's get them
down here!

1015
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,040
Let's go!

1016
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,118
Don't you fucking move!

1017
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,711
Get them, go!
What did we do?

1018
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,520
You better
shut your mouth!

1019
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,480
Get them! Get
the fuck... Get out of here!

1020
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,959
Get the fuck downstairs!

1021
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,990
Go! Let's get them
down here!

1022
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,616
Go!
Down the stairs! Let's go!

1023
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,000
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay!

1024
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,988
Come on, man!
My arm, man! Stop!

1025
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,479
We didn't even do anything!

1026
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,555
Shit!

1027
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,508
Where's Carl, man?

1028
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,599
Where's Carl?

1029
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,189
What happened?

1030
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,596
Fella here had a knife,
tried to go for my gun.

1031
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,751
Yeah, I heard him shout,
"Get off my gun!"

1032
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,157
Yeah, it all happened
pretty fast.

1033
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,032
I guess you had
to defend yourself.

1034
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,949
Aubrey, get back!

1035
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,828
Get back
against the wall! Move!

1036
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,638
Chill!
They killed Carl!

1037
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,677
Don't be stupid, boy!
Stay against the wall!

1038
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,875
Okay, okay.

1039
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,760
He has his face filled
with blood. They killed him, man.

1040
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,395
Shame.
A young kid like that.

1041
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,550
Still, he might be the shooter.
We need to find out.

1042
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,640
They killed him, man.

1043
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,911
They killed our friend.

1044
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,912
What's the deal
with the girls?

1045
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,880
I found them with the
big nigger down the end.

1046
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,989
Same room?

1047
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,193
You find anything?
Nothing.

1048
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,320
No gun?

1049
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,400
No.

1050
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,919
Some bad news.

1051
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,393
One of the guests is dead.

1052
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,109
He tried to take
a police officer's weapon,

1053
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,192
ended up getting shot.

1054
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,508
Carl Cooper.

1055
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,714
He killed Carl.

1056
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,593
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1057
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,795
Amen.

1058
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,316
Now let's not be stupid
in this situation.

1059
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,791
We still have a crime scene
here and you're all suspects.

1060
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,793
Each and every one of you.

1061
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,912
Don't look at me!

1062
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,111
Turn around, face the wall!

1063
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,837
Was Carl the one
doing the shooting?

1064
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,680
Huh?

1065
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,117
Somebody better start
getting honest with me.

1066
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,108
Hey! I want that gun!

1067
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,656
We looked around,
we didn't find a gun.

1068
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,796
Doesn't mean
it's not here! Go find it!

1069
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,514
You, too!

1070
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,831
I got nothing
against you people.

1071
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,680
But you need to tell me
where the gun is.

1072
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,352
You need to tell me

1073
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,831
who was doing the shooting.

1074
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,996
I'm only gonna ask
so many times.

1075
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,998
Who did the shooting?

1076
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,160
We don't know.

1077
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,713
You do fucking know!

1078
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,998
You were upstairs,
who was doing the shooting?

1079
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,176
Who was doing the shooting?
You doing the shooting, man!

1080
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,349
Lee!

1081
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
No, man.

1082
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,877
Carl ain't got no gun.

1083
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,320
What's that?

1084
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,038
You're the ones out here
killing people!

1085
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,716
Say that to my face!

1086
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,393
I said, Carl ain't shoot
nobody, man!

1087
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,232
Yeah, all right.

1088
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,389
Fuck.

1089
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,310
Stop your goddamn crying!
Face the door!

1090
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,198
You, too. Face the front!

1091
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,670
Why don't you pick that up
and defend yourself?

1092
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,429
Hmm?

1093
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,512
It's easy, look.

1094
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,552
You sure you don't wanna
try and stab me?

1095
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,953
I'm not gonna play your game.

1096
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,195
Come on.

1097
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,192
That would just give me
an excuse to do

1098
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,111
what we both know
is gonna happen anyway.

1099
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,555
Right?

1100
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,192
Man, y'all
some crazy crackers!

1101
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,277
Shit!

1102
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,839
Get off of me.

1103
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,711
You still a cracker.

1104
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,030
Shut the fuck up, all right?
Shut up.

1105
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,310
There's a goddamn
shooter in this house.

1106
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,959
Was it Carl?

1107
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,158
Let me tell you something.

1108
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,836
If you think that you can
shoot at innocent people

1109
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,069
and get away with it,

1110
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,598
you are dead wrong.

1111
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,074
My partner said, "stand up."

1112
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,037
Look, I'll take him.
So stand.

1113
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,856
Go search the place,
I'll take him with me.

1114
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,677
Come on, come on.

1115
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,751
Come on.
Get the fuck outta here.

1116
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,712
I got all night, people.

1117
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,477
Nobody's gonna talk?

1118
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,032
Nobody knows
who the shooter is?

1119
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,479
Please, God. Please, God.

1120
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,039
Nobody's going to admit shit?

1121
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,509
All right.

1122
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,677
Then start prayin'.

1123
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,470
Start praying. What's the
matter, boy? You don't pray?

1124
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,792
You don't go
to fuckin' church?

1125
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,997
- Start praying!
- Oh, Lord.

1126
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,376
Forgive our trespasses as we forgive
those that trespass against us.

1127
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,311
'Cause I will
kill you, one by one,

1128
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,870
until you tell me exactly
what is going on here.

1129
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,871
Cover us with
the blood of Jesus, God.

1130
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,199
I'm just gonna assume
you're all criminals.

1131
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,158
Because if we're honest,
you probably are.

1132
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,239
So let's hear it.

1133
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,072
Let's fucking hear it!

1134
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,391
Pray! Do it loud!

1135
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,551
You don't sing
that gospel shit?

1136
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,912
My way

1137
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,216
There you go,
now we got two of 'em.

1138
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,456
Take the hate out
of our hearts, God.

1139
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,549
What about you?

1140
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,994
Your grace is with me

1141
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,913
You are not praying. I'm not
hearing shit out of you.

1142
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,896
- Mary, full of grace...
- I don't give a fuck.

1143
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,514
You may need a little fuckin'
help to know how to pray.

1144
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,355
You are near me

1145
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,320
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1146
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,919
When my life

1147
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,599
He's really fuckin' praying.

1148
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,034
It's not bad.

1149
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,759
All right, check the room.

1150
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,758
Under the beds
and in the drawers. Okay?

1151
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,793
They're gonna kill us, man.

1152
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,630
Why? You gonna be crazy?

1153
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,471
They the ones
that's acting crazy.

1154
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,119
They lost they mind
when they seen

1155
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,080
a couple white girls
in a room with a black man.

1156
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,077
They're lookin' for
a sniper, okay?

1157
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,030
But Carl wasn't
no sniper, man.

1158
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,868
So if a guy goes for your gun,

1159
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,791
you gonna let him have it
because he's black?

1160
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,029
Come on!

1161
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,789
A cop has a shotgun
like yours, right?

1162
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,991
You hold that tight
with two hands.

1163
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,991
How you even gonna
try to take that?

1164
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,833
Lotta ways.

1165
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,320
There's no guns
in this whole motel

1166
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,271
except the ones
these cops brought.

1167
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,593
There's no guns.

1168
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,635
We takin' something
for those crazy boys.

1169
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,833
Pick 'em up.

1170
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,792
What's the point?

1171
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,274
Look, I understand. Okay?

1172
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,036
But don't antagonize
those guys.

1173
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,711
I need you
to survive the night.

1174
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,799
Survive the night.

1175
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,713
All right?

1176
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,376
You don't think
you're gonna talk?

1177
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,719
I'll fucking make you talk.

1178
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,880
Where's the fuckin' gun?

1179
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,551
Get up!
Get the fuck up!

1180
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,776
You gonna tell me
where the gun is?

1181
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,711
- I don't know.
- Bullshit!

1182
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,791
Stop fucking lying to me!

1183
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,473
Where's the fucking gun!

1184
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,440
I swear to God,
I'll pull the fucking trigger!

1185
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,560
Where is it?

1186
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,216
I don't know,
I swear...

1187
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,240
Bullshit!

1188
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,395
Come here.

1189
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,595
What's going on?

1190
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,154
I gotta tell you, Detroit PD
is going nuts in there.

1191
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,389
What do you mean?

1192
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,192
Looks like they're
terrorizing suspects,

1193
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,376
beating and so forth,
trying to get a confession.

1194
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,755
Well, that's not correct,
they got their civil rights.

1195
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,989
That's what I'm saying.

1196
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,674
Don't look right to me.

1197
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,080
Where's
that fucking gun?

1198
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,758
Don't lie to me!
Where's the gun?

1199
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,068
All right.

1200
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,431
Let's let them have the case.

1201
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,275
I don't wanna get involved in any
civil rights mix-up, you know?

1202
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,073
Let's go.

1203
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,712
Where's the fucking gun!
I don't know!

1204
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,030
Bullshit!
You people are always lying!

1205
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,235
Who's the shooter?

1206
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,915
Find it?

1207
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,115
No.

1208
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,113
All this looks stolen.

1209
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,912
I searched
the whole room, myself.

1210
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,112
He wouldn't even
tell you, huh?

1211
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,630
All right.
Get Demens to watch the line.

1212
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,949
Come with me.

1213
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,912
Get in there. Quickly.

1214
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,200
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Lie down.

1215
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,752
Come on!
We need you in here.

1216
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,400
Get the...

1217
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,471
Get on the goddamn floor.

1218
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,551
You don't have to
do this, man.

1219
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,639
We're gonna hold the line.

1220
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,355
Why you gotta fuck them, huh?

1221
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,989
What's wrong with us?

1222
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,315
Listen to me.

1223
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,954
You need to tell me

1224
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,590
where the gun is
and who the shooter is...

1225
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,193
I swear to you there's no gun.

1226
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,360
There's no gun, man!

1227
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,200
...or I swear to God,
I will kill you.

1228
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,589
There's no gun, man.

1229
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:44,960
Okay.

1230
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,519
I don't know nothing, man.

1231
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,879
No!

1232
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,479
He shot him. He shot him.

1233
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,359
Face the fucking wall.

1234
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,630
Be still and stay quiet,

1235
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,155
or the next one is for real.

1236
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,355
Understand?

1237
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,079
This'll make 'em talk.
Watch this.

1238
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,918
That one didn't even kick.

1239
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,911
That's what happens
when you lie to us.

1240
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,436
Who else wants to kill one?

1241
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,999
You wanna kill one?

1242
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,829
Okay.

1243
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,594
All right.

1244
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,277
Officer, wait!
I didn't shoot nobody!

1245
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,668
Officer, wait!
Shut up!

1246
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:03,880
Fuck!

1247
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,520
Shut up.
Get the fuck in there.

1248
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:07,776
I told you I don't know where
the fucking gun is, man.

1249
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,440
You looked for it, right?
Shut your mouth!

1250
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,397
Hey, man. You gotta tell me where
the gun is so all this can stop.

1251
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,794
Where's the gun?
I don't know.

1252
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,951
You can't do this shit!
Shut the fuck up!

1253
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,040
Michael. Michael.

1254
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,792
You think we're bluffin'?

1255
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,473
This is Detroit.

1256
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,353
We don't bluff.

1257
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,550
Now, be quiet,

1258
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,710
or the next one
will be for real.

1259
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,598
I killed that nigger.

1260
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,279
There you have it.

1261
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,874
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1262
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,039
Get your goddamn hands
off her. Turn around.

1263
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,633
What's your part
in all this, huh?

1264
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,871
Probably know
where the gun is.

1265
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,030
Probably know
who the shooter is.

1266
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,156
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1267
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,798
Yes, you do.

1268
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,108
And you're lyin' to me.

1269
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,509
Get away from me!

1270
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,176
You think you'd get a pass
'cause you're white?

1271
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,430
No, whore. You don't.
Find out what she knows.

1272
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,358
It's okay. Easy, easy.

1273
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,355
Face the goddamn wall.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

1274
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,632
It's just you and me.

1275
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,480
Take a seat.

1276
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,475
Sit down.

1277
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,748
Sit down.

1278
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,355
Ouch.

1279
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,353
You all right there, miss?

1280
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,033
Is everything okay?

1281
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,594
You're okay though, right?

1282
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,238
Don't touch me.

1283
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,154
Try to keep calm.

1284
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,832
What are you doin'
living here?

1285
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,428
It's a hotel, isn't it?

1286
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,794
Yeah.

1287
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,552
So you're up here
for a while?

1288
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,034
Some, uh,

1289
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,753
prostitution, maybe?

1290
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:05,194
I'm visiting from Ohio.

1291
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,998
My father is a judge.

1292
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,275
And your father,
he knows you're here, right?

1293
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,157
Living amongst the blacks?

1294
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,468
Are there black people here?

1295
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,118
I didn't notice,
I'm colorblind.

1296
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,875
Really?

1297
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,316
What color am I? Blue?

1298
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,713
You look yellow to me, sir.

1299
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,798
You're working prostitution.
No!

1300
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,394
Look at me.

1301
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,400
You're fuckin'
these black guys, right?

1302
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,559
They're kids.

1303
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,949
What's the matter with you?

1304
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,868
I'm trying
to protect you, miss.

1305
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,958
Stay there.

1306
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,915
She's a hooker.

1307
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,192
All right, fuck it.
Come here.

1308
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,591
So, you are the pimp.

1309
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,069
No, sir.
I think you're mistaken.

1310
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,278
- Fuck!
- Listen.

1311
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,839
We've got
all the time in the world.

1312
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,751
We are gonna get
to the bottom of this.

1313
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,355
So think very carefully about
how you answer our questions,

1314
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,761
or you're gonna end up like
your friends in the next room.

1315
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,080
How long you been pimpin' out
these young girls, huh?

1316
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,440
Destroying their bodies
and minds.

1317
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,471
I just met 'em.
I ain't pimpin'.

1318
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,993
I just got back from the war.

1319
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,640
You're a veteran?

1320
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,195
Yes, sir.

1321
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,229
Fuckin' stupid
do you think I am?

1322
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,389
You wear army green,

1323
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,880
you try to be
a fucking serviceman.

1324
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,355
We don't need
pimps in the army.

1325
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,836
Probably drove
a fucking supply truck.

1326
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,196
I was airborne.

1327
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,913
Look out!

1328
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,753
Take cover!

1329
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,313
Move to cover!

1330
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,913
Get down! Get down!

1331
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,472
Go, go, go!

1332
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,151
- Take cover!
- Sniper!

1333
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,875
Down, down!

1334
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,475
Across the street!
They're running up Euclid!

1335
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,016
- Three houses up.
- I see him!

1336
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,632
Who's got eyes on him?

1337
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,960
Don't worry about it. If it
was anything, they'd grab us.

1338
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,073
Larry, what are you doin'?

1339
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,355
Larry.

1340
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,758
Get back on the wall.

1341
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,279
Let's get the fuck up
outta here.

1342
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,679
They're gonna
come back.

1343
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,159
We can. Let's go.

1344
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,468
No.

1345
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,760
What are you doing, man?

1346
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,474
Come on. Come on.

1347
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,359
Fred, let's go.

1348
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:57,873
No, Larry. Stop.

1349
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,031
Who's got eyes on him?

1350
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,758
Watch the roof!

1351
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,158
Just breathe,
just breathe.

1352
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,597
It's okay.
I'm here, I'm here.

1353
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,799
Come on, come on.

1354
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,992
Stay the fuck away.

1355
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,756
Check all those windows!

1356
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,912
Hold your perimeter!

1357
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,656
They're shooting.
You hear that?

1358
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,715
Shut up!

1359
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,712
Fall back!
Covering fire! Put it down!

1360
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,869
Fire! Fire!

1361
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,709
Oh, shit!

1362
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,835
Oh, shit!

1363
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,440
- We got 'em!
- Hold your fire!

1364
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,953
All right, it's clear.

1365
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,151
Snipers everywhere, tonight.

1366
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,268
Clear!

1367
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,035
Is that your
buddies out there, huh?

1368
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,872
Is that who was
shooting at us?

1369
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,238
Huh? What do you gotta say?

1370
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:44,880
Fuck!

1371
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,912
Says right there.
Paratrooper, eight years.

1372
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,632
Two deployments.

1373
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,029
Honorable discharge.

1374
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,630
This is a fake.
No, sir.

1375
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,236
- This your girl?
- I just met her.

1376
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,469
What's his name?

1377
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,553
I don't know.

1378
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,993
His name is Karl Greene.

1379
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,798
I wasn't asking you,
I was asking her.

1380
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,472
You just said,
"What's his name?"

1381
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,233
You're lucky I haven't broken
your fuckin' neck, yet.

1382
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,639
Okay.

1383
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,995
All right, man. I see
what you're trying to do.

1384
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,674
I'm not gonna cause
any trouble, okay?

1385
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,399
But I'm not gonna
lie down for you, either.

1386
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,079
What are you doin'
in Detroit, huh?

1387
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,914
Like everybody else,
I'm lookin' for work.

1388
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,896
Left one war zone
and joined another.

1389
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,035
Yeah.

1390
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,154
All right. Get this
motherfucker back in line.

1391
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,992
Give me back
my government card, man.

1392
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,513
Why don't you
get outta here?

1393
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,716
Run out the back door. Run.

1394
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,079
Right now, go!

1395
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:30,716
You know the one
who was praying?

1396
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,438
He's okay, it's not him.

1397
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,272
And you can
scratch off G.I.Joe.

1398
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,040
That little twerp with
the big, fuckin' prayer.

1399
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,792
Yeah, it's not him.

1400
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,430
That leaves us with the big
motherfucker who's in that room.

1401
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,794
I like him for it.

1402
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,193
Okay.
Yeah.

1403
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,949
Flynn.

1404
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,515
Fuck!

1405
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,673
He's escaped.

1406
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,874
Well, we need another one.

1407
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:10,995
I know.

1408
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,030
Still... Still no gun.

1409
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,392
So, who wants to go next?

1410
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,349
Hmm?

1411
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,112
Please, please, please.

1412
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,871
Please. Just, please, please.

1413
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,996
Officer, can I say something?

1414
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,833
There we go.

1415
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,399
Yes, you can.

1416
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,836
I think you have
the wrong house.

1417
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,071
'Cause nobody we saw...

1418
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,153
'Cause nobody we saw here
was shooting at the police.

1419
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,879
Please.

1420
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,230
It's possible
we made a mistake.

1421
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,395
But I need to know for sure.

1422
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,556
Can't let a cop killer
get away with it, can I?

1423
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,870
Please, please.

1424
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,598
How about you, sweetheart?

1425
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,668
You wanna be next?

1426
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,760
- No.
- Hmm?

1427
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,759
No, I don't, please.

1428
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,896
I think
you know something.

1429
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:45,955
I don't.

1430
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,056
You wanna just die now...

1431
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,195
No.

1432
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,616
...or watch me
kill the others first?

1433
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,200
Which one, huh? Which one?

1434
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,350
Get her outta here. Jesus!
And her! Up!

1435
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,555
Upstairs!

1436
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:03,119
No!

1437
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,199
Shut up!

1438
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,998
You wanna cry, huh?

1439
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,354
Jesus Christ!

1440
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,668
You wanna cry?

1441
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:17,976
I'll give you something
to cry about.

1442
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,800
Watch them.
This one's coming with me.

1443
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,068
Shut up!

1444
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,776
You wanna cry, huh? I'll give
you something to cry about.

1445
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,279
Leave her alone!

1446
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,954
I guess there are no weapons
on your person.

1447
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,589
Stay over there
and keep quiet.

1448
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,439
God.

1449
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,278
Aren't you ashamed
of yourselves?

1450
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,078
You're the one
checking out my tits.

1451
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,912
You're having
sex with niggers.

1452
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,194
It's 1967, asshole.

1453
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:56,948
Honestly.

1454
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,712
It doesn't bother you?

1455
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,518
The Afro Sheen in their hair?

1456
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,199
The way it smells?

1457
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,713
You're on some trip.

1458
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,438
You think you can
come into my city

1459
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,112
and pimp out a bunch
of young girls?

1460
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,077
I said it wasn't like that.

1461
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,276
I don't care
if you were in the army.

1462
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,828
I'll drown all you pimps in the
river until the city's clean.

1463
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,072
You gonna question them or I'm
gonna take 'em outta here.

1464
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,718
Just hold on.

1465
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,520
Look.

1466
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,677
You might not be
such bad girls after all.

1467
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,997
But be straight with me.

1468
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,000
Who was shootin' at the
National Guard out there?

1469
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:38,920
Mister?

1470
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,954
I didn't see anybody shoot
at the National Guard.

1471
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,031
I would tell you if I had.

1472
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,314
You would?

1473
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,194
You can think I'm a slut if you
want, but I was raised right.

1474
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,031
All right. I'm gonna
get 'em outta here.

1475
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,110
Let's get you
covered up, okay?

1476
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,108
You too.

1477
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,480
Come on.

1478
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,992
Hey, can I get a hand?

1479
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,029
Fuck.

1480
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,314
Fuck those fuckers.

1481
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,736
You're fucking
murdering those kids!

1482
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,591
Why don't you stop them?

1483
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,628
This animal did it too.
He shot one of them!

1484
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,456
Don't concern yourself.
They're just scaring them.

1485
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,640
It's an interrogation tactic.

1486
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,632
Are you nuts, Mister?
I saw the bodies!

1487
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,597
Those guys are getting
murdered in cold blood.

1488
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,631
I didn't really
shoot the guy.

1489
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,956
It's not real.

1490
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,679
I didn't shoot that guy,
and neither did the other.

1491
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,718
It's to get the guys to fess up
about the location of the gun.

1492
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,955
Who said they even had a gun?

1493
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,160
I don't know.

1494
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,714
If they did, it was just a toy.
It wasn't a real gun.

1495
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,716
Well, thanks for saving us.

1496
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:30,949
We gotta head out.

1497
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,552
Are we safe here?

1498
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,674
She means, are you gonna tell
the police where we are?

1499
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:40,914
No.

1500
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,840
Karen.

1501
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,716
We're gonna be okay.

1502
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,518
But those boys...

1503
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,359
Fucking stay there.

1504
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,078
You see that? See that shit?

1505
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,151
That is your fault
right there. Look at it.

1506
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,754
You don't talk, that's
what happens. Look at it.

1507
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,748
At ease.

1508
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:27,318
That kid. Him.

1509
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,753
He was up there
in the same room

1510
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,040
as those other
two delinquents.

1511
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,640
Yeah. Let's get
our confession out of him,

1512
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,079
vacate the premises,
all right?

1513
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,710
Okay.
Demens should do it.

1514
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,555
Do what?

1515
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,234
You haven't
killed a nigger yet.

1516
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,398
Uh...

1517
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,557
Well, I don't know
about that.

1518
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,913
Sure you do.

1519
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,635
What's the matter, partner?
Problem?

1520
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,474
Whatever you say.
Which one?

1521
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,314
Come with me. I gotta ask you
some questions.

1522
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,599
Please.

1523
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,314
Please don't
kill me, please.

1524
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,072
Please don't
shoot me, please.

1525
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,310
Where is the gun?

1526
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,391
I don't know. Please.

1527
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,472
I don't know. I swear to God,
I don't know. Please. Please.

1528
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,118
I got no cause
to shoot you.

1529
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,656
Please don't
shoot. Please.

1530
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,908
Where's the gun?

1531
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,336
Please don't
shoot me, man.

1532
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,430
I ain't never shot
anybody before in my life.

1533
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,394
Please! I don't know
where... Please.

1534
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,878
Please, don't...

1535
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,193
Turn around.

1536
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,272
They fucking killed him.

1537
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,191
So that's done.

1538
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,952
Good. Great job.

1539
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,837
I didn't think I could do it,
but I did it.

1540
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,718
Boy, I feel funny.

1541
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,032
Yeah. It's the right thing.
He'll talk now.

1542
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,829
What do you mean?

1543
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,512
Another one bites the dust.

1544
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,160
I bet some of you thought
we weren't serious, huh?

1545
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,559
Well, we still
don't have our gun

1546
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,278
and we are running
out of time, people.

1547
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,713
Who was the sniper?

1548
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,318
Just be honest with us
so we can all go home.

1549
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,038
You shot him, Demens.

1550
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,348
Yeah, I got him.

1551
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,314
Jesus Christ, Marty.

1552
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,016
We weren't actually
shooting the other guys.

1553
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,314
We're playing with them.

1554
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,715
What do you mean?

1555
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,120
Playing.

1556
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,480
Playing what?

1557
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,868
A game.

1558
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,278
A game to get them to talk,
scare the shit out of 'em.

1559
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,588
Interrogation tactics.

1560
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,954
Fuck.

1561
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,316
This is strictly
police business.

1562
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,875
Hey, boys,
let's move out.

1563
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,349
Have you got...
You don't have a knife.

1564
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,351
- Fuck me.
- Oh, fuck.

1565
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,509
Okay, listen. Listen.

1566
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,829
Listen to me.
Oh, fuck.

1567
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,752
He grabbed your gun,
all right,

1568
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,520
and you warned him, okay?

1569
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,791
And you were forced to shoot him, okay?
Line of duty.

1570
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,416
Get your fucking story straight.
Oh, fuck.

1571
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,079
Hey, get your head straight.
I'm serious.

1572
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,599
All right,
just take a minute.

1573
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,275
Stay here.

1574
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,553
Oh, God.

1575
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,709
Oh, fuck.

1576
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,754
Marty shot the guy.

1577
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,239
What?

1578
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,389
He did?
Yeah.

1579
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,393
Point blank.

1580
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,954
We need to wrap this up
and get out of here.

1581
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,032
We don't have a suspect.

1582
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,316
Should we just
arrest them all?

1583
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:07,194
No, no, not now. We just need
to get out of here, you know?

1584
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,390
And... Us and them.

1585
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,916
If they're smart, they're not
gonna say anything, all right?

1586
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,352
All right. Let's do this.

1587
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:19,993
You come with me.

1588
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,199
Listen to me.

1589
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,994
You're free to go.

1590
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,236
But you don't talk about this
to anyone, ever.

1591
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,200
You understand?

1592
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:40,794
'Cause I got your name,

1593
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,791
and I know
exactly who you are.

1594
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:45,995
I don't got your name.

1595
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,909
I don't know
nothin' about you.

1596
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,998
Please don't kill me.

1597
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:56,955
Please don't kill him.

1598
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,672
What's this here?

1599
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,398
I don't see nothin'.

1600
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,952
All right.

1601
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,673
Get going.

1602
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,276
Hey, we don't know nothin'.

1603
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,833
We don't know nothin'.

1604
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,717
No, no, no, no!

1605
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,315
Relax.

1606
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,834
Listen.

1607
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,390
What if I told you you can
run out that door right now,

1608
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,989
but you never talk about
what you saw here?

1609
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,519
Understand?

1610
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:22,355
Please don't kill him.
Please don't kill him.

1611
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,588
No, no, no!

1612
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,153
Listen to me.

1613
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,238
What do you see here?

1614
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,952
You killed him.

1615
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,479
You killed him.

1616
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,797
We're gonna try this again.

1617
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,638
I don't see anything.

1618
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,315
There's a dead guy
right there.

1619
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,674
Halt!

1620
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,234
Please, please, please...

1621
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:17,920
Please, please, please...

1622
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,155
Hey.

1623
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,199
Hey.

1624
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,077
Oh, my God.

1625
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:30,037
Who could do this
to someone?

1626
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:33,749
Hey, hey, hey. I'm here
to help you, all right?

1627
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,190
Come on. Hey.

1628
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,077
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital, okay?

1629
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,912
All right? Relax.

1630
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,598
Okay? Hey, hey,
it's all right.

1631
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,472
Come with me. Come on.

1632
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:51,551
Come on.
We're gonna get you there.

1633
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:52,868
Come on, brother.

1634
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:01,998
Don't you go on me, all right?
Come on. Come on.

1635
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:08,835
We got him.

1636
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,075
Let's go.

1637
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,518
Aubrey! Phone call!

1638
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:41,840
Aubrey, hey!

1639
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,148
You got phone call!

1640
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,271
Say again?
You got a call from home.

1641
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,708
Something's wrong.

1642
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,597
Kid's in trouble or hurt,
or something.

1643
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,318
Bet it's my youngest.

1644
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,155
He's always googy-googy.

1645
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,428
Yes?

1646
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,719
Well, Aubrey,

1647
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:14,918
they found Aubrey dead this
morning at the Algiers Motel.

1648
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,555
No. No. Aubrey's supposed
to be at home.

1649
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,277
It's gotta be somebody else.

1650
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:03,998
What is this, Ma?

1651
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:06,159
A mistake?

1652
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,711
It's gotta be a mistake.

1653
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,231
Aubrey's got more sense
than that.

1654
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:16,312
Well, baby, you never know.

1655
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,233
Let's go see.

1656
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,555
Dismukes?

1657
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,279
Is he there?

1658
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,397
Looking for a Dismukes.

1659
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,634
Appreciate it.

1660
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,589
Any of you fellas
named Dismukes?

1661
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,633
Yeah, that's me.

1662
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,678
I have to ask you
to come with us, sir.

1663
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:58,319
Is there a problem?

1664
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,589
No. I don't think so.

1665
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,272
Rather not have
to ask again, though.

1666
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,158
Y'all tell the boss, huh?

1667
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,479
You got this?

1668
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,351
- Take care of yourself.
- This way.

1669
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,431
Come on, I ain't got all day.

1670
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,034
Take a seat.

1671
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,069
I'm sorry, I...

1672
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,909
I assume this is about
what went on at the motel?

1673
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,511
What happened at the motel?

1674
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,760
If you don't know,
I'll tell you.

1675
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:03,077
I was working security
by Wisconsin.

1676
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:05,310
And on Tuesday night,
we heard gunfire

1677
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:08,039
coming from the area
near the Algiers.

1678
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:10,315
Oh.
In that direction.

1679
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:13,238
Police was there.
State police, National Guard.

1680
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,509
It was a lot of shooting.

1681
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,399
And when I went in there,
three kids had been killed.

1682
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,629
No.

1683
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:23,109
Yes, sir.
This right there, right?

1684
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:25,191
Is that what
you're talking about?

1685
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:29,109
Yes, sir.

1686
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,315
Yeah.

1687
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,870
He was lying just like this.
The blood was fresh.

1688
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,678
It hadn't congealed yet.

1689
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,835
So they were killed
right before you got there?

1690
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,395
Yes, sir.

1691
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:48,116
You carry a.38, right?

1692
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,555
A revolver.
Do you carry a revolver?

1693
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,119
I do have a.38.

1694
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,397
Hmm. You ever shoot anyone?

1695
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,789
No.
Strike anyone?

1696
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,798
Not the way you mean, sir.
What do I mean?

1697
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,239
Fellas,

1698
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,197
you know, sometimes,

1699
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,953
when a black guy's put
in a position of authority,

1700
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,111
other black guys, they like
to single you out, okay?

1701
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,668
Because I'm not supposed
to tell 'em what to do.

1702
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,158
When we have
these conversations,

1703
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:36,470
we do them in stages, okay?

1704
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,155
Stage one, witnesses.

1705
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:43,396
Stage two, suspects.

1706
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,552
What stage are we in?

1707
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,000
You don't know
what stage we're in?

1708
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:49,792
No. Could you
specify for me?

1709
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:52,110
Yeah, we're in stage two.

1710
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,953
You're a suspect.

1711
01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,277
I didn't do it.

1712
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:01,360
The police...

1713
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,715
Ah, here we go.

1714
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:07,519
The police shot those kids.

1715
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:09,790
See,
how the hell do you know that

1716
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:12,030
when you weren't inside
the building

1717
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:14,429
until after
the shooting stopped?

1718
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:17,114
So, are you lying to us now,

1719
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:20,033
or were you lying
just a minute ago?

1720
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:22,120
That's
a good question, Detective.

1721
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,635
You need to think real hard.

1722
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,392
You need to answer me.

1723
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:31,640
All due respect,
I am telling the truth.

1724
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,233
I'm not lying.

1725
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,675
I told you what I saw.
I saw these kids...

1726
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,512
Melvin.
Okay. Okay.

1727
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,670
We're here to help you, okay?
Yes, sir.

1728
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,518
Melvin, do you
wanna go home?

1729
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,600
Yeah.

1730
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:46,256
Can we let him think about it?

1731
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:48,919
Yeah.
You think about it, okay, Melvin?

1732
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,752
I didn't do it.

1733
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,440
Number four, step forward.

1734
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,315
You're doing
a real good job, honey.

1735
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,233
Eddie...

1736
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,833
Has he woken up?

1737
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:07,239
No, man.

1738
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,069
Hey.

1739
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,154
Larry.

1740
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:15,992
Hey, wake up, brother.

1741
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,269
Hey.

1742
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,034
Be gentle.

1743
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:26,990
It's all right, man.
It's us.

1744
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,355
You know where
my little brother is?

1745
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:34,232
The police are saying
Fred is dead,

1746
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,280
but I can't get nobody
to tell me what's going on.

1747
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:40,434
What's going on?

1748
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,232
You tell us, man.

1749
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,039
The police...

1750
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,234
The police?

1751
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:53,799
The police...

1752
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:56,914
They...

1753
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:19,397
You have children?
Oh, yes. I have three boys.

1754
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:23,556
The oldest is 12.
Then nine and seven.

1755
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:25,471
You know
how youngsters are then.

1756
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:26,913
Oh, boy...

1757
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,838
The way they communicate,
grunts and groans.

1758
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,279
My little cavemen.

1759
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,396
Especially boys.

1760
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:37,536
It's like they don't know if
they wanna be slick, you know?

1761
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:39,039
That's right.

1762
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:41,680
They're still trying
to find their place in life

1763
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,432
and we have
to allow for that.

1764
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,669
Uh-huh.

1765
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:49,639
Oh, yes.

1766
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,675
Hmm.

1767
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,639
Well,

1768
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:59,033
I can see
you want to go back there.

1769
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:02,429
Sure.

1770
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,792
We helped put out fires.

1771
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:28,031
We helped try to keep the riots
down and keep the corner clear.

1772
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:29,473
What can you say

1773
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:32,279
about having all this
murdering and confusion?

1774
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:36,873
Everybody isn't thieves
and murderers.

1775
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:41,272
I wish that things could be
better for the negro people.

1776
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:51,838
Just, uh...

1777
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,096
Remember what I told you, and this
whole thing's gonna blow over.

1778
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:56,759
All right?
You did nothing wrong.

1779
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:02,673
I think I gotta say somethin'.

1780
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,832
Hey. You made...

1781
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,509
Demens.

1782
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,036
Something that took one minute

1783
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:18,429
should not define
your entire life.

1784
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,272
You understand?

1785
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,032
You made a mistake.

1786
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,795
You say what you need to say,

1787
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:28,988
and you move on.

1788
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:31,117
That's how
you get out of this thing.

1789
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,312
All right?
All right.

1790
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,589
All right?

1791
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:39,154
Yeah. You don't have to lecture
me, I know what to do.

1792
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,639
There you go.

1793
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:44,112
You were doing your job.

1794
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,950
You first, knucklehead!

1795
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:00,635
All right.

1796
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,669
Flynn!

1797
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,080
All right. Let's go, ladies.

1798
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:07,917
I'll be with you
in a few minutes.

1799
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,073
Well?

1800
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,717
Some things were said
in there.

1801
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:24,151
Such as?

1802
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,632
You stupid...
You motherfucker, you're dead.

1803
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:31,233
You're fucking dead.

1804
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,112
You too?

1805
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:39,837
We're all going down.

1806
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,548
Phil, listen. It's...

1807
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:46,715
No. No.
Just listen to me.

1808
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,472
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- Phil!

1809
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:12,675
I got nothing to say
without my union lawyer.

1810
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,432
Are you kidding me,
you racist fuck?

1811
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,034
Get out of the car
before I break your neck.

1812
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,713
I couldn't say for sure who
went inside the building first.

1813
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:28,709
Um...

1814
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:32,279
There were five,

1815
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:34,715
maybe six state police.

1816
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:37,837
We have complete statements
from your partners.

1817
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,868
We know you shot those kids.

1818
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:42,993
So just go from there.

1819
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:47,156
No. No.

1820
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:49,549
I don't recall
doing that. Uh...

1821
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:51,960
Bang his head against
the table. Might help.

1822
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,229
Hey.

1823
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,630
I'm trying to help here.

1824
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:58,672
I'm trying to be thorough.

1825
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:01,073
So, you wanna know

1826
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:03,071
how many state police
were on the scene,

1827
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:04,599
how many National Guard?

1828
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:08,076
I can't tell if you're stupid
or smart,

1829
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:10,071
but I'm willing to find out.

1830
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:12,198
Don't say another word.

1831
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:13,509
Come on.

1832
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:15,679
What's the point?

1833
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,558
Coercive testimony
will be tossed.

1834
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,513
Larry!

1835
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:34,080
Yo, you sure he's home?

1836
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:35,709
Give him a minute.

1837
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:42,519
Man, what?
What's so important?

1838
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,272
The record company
called, baby!

1839
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,591
They wanna hear our music
at the studio!

1840
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,074
Oh, and they called you?

1841
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:49,696
Yeah, man. They said
they tried to call you

1842
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:50,920
but you never
called them back.

1843
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,270
This is what
we've been working for, man.

1844
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,713
They wanna hear
The Dramatics!

1845
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,598
So what?
You Mr. Show Business now?

1846
01:51:57,680 --> 01:51:59,432
This isn't professional.

1847
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:02,713
Call at business hours,
not 3:00 in the morning.

1848
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:04,394
But Larry...

1849
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:08,473
Larry! It's a record company, man.
They don't keep banking hours.

1850
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:09,914
Come on.

1851
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,755
Listen, you guys
had better sound good

1852
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:28,034
because I'm broke.

1853
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,316
Let me hear that blend.

1854
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:35,159
Uh, yes, sir.

1855
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:37,117
Are you guys ready?
Yeah.

1856
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:41,469
One, two.
One, two, three, four.

1857
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,831
Look in my eyes
And don't you see water?

1858
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:47,599
And it's all
because of you

1859
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,349
Well look at me
I ain't acting like I oughta

1860
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:55,637
And it's all
because of you

1861
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,350
Ooh

1862
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,958
Ooh

1863
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,759
Uh, George,
can we get a minute?

1864
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,160
- Come on.
- Yeah, hurry back.

1865
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:19,358
Look, what is
in your head, man?

1866
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:20,656
'Cause you ain't singin'
in there.

1867
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:22,760
How am I supposed to sing
with what happened to Fred?

1868
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,632
Look, you just do it.

1869
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:26,551
Sing while my boy
is lying dead?

1870
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:29,794
Look, a song ain't words
on a page, man.

1871
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,279
That ain't music.

1872
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,634
Music is what you put into it

1873
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,176
and you can make that
whatever you want.

1874
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,475
I'm not singing so white
motherfuckers can dance!

1875
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,640
Well, them pale motherfuckers
ain't dancing for free!

1876
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:44,713
Since when do you care
if white folks dance anyway?

1877
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:58,750
During the week
of rioting in Detroit,

1878
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:01,308
three negros were shot
to death in a motel room.

1879
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,516
Police and the Guardsmen
had raided the motel,

1880
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:04,669
searching for snipers.

1881
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,992
Later,
witnesses to the shootings

1882
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,150
said the three negros
had been lined up

1883
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:12,038
and shot in cold blood
by the officers.

1884
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,950
Today, two police officers
were arrested

1885
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:16,519
and charged with the murders

1886
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:18,795
of two of the negros
shot in the motel.

1887
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,791
The officers,
one with two years' service,

1888
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,359
the other with four

1889
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,351
and no previous
misconduct charges,

1890
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:26,237
were ordered
held without bail.

1891
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,311
They pleaded not guilty.
Their attorney said

1892
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,675
the arrests
were a shame and a pity.

1893
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,518
Police Commissioner,
Ray Girardin,

1894
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:34,511
refused to discuss
the facts of the case,

1895
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:36,238
except to say
the two officers...

1896
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:38,678
Who do you got mail for?

1897
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:40,113
Larry Cleveland Reed?

1898
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,392
Larry!

1899
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,119
Larry, you got a letter.
From the government.

1900
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:01,072
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1901
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,955
I didn't do nothin'!
I didn't do nothin'!

1902
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:52,400
- Lie down.
- Please, man!

1903
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:54,596
I will kill you
one by one

1904
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:58,468
until you tell me
exactly what is going on here.

1905
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:02,272
Don't look at me. Turn around.

1906
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:03,918
Start praying!

1907
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,672
Get down! Get up!

1908
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,792
Get the fuck up! Get up!

1909
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,916
Bullshit!
Stop fucking lying to me!

1910
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,433
Carl ain't got no gun.

1911
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:13,696
One of the guests
is dead.

1912
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:15,312
Please don't shoot.
Please.

1913
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:16,549
Where's the gun?

1914
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:18,000
Please don't shoot me,
man!

1915
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:20,952
Officer,
can I say something?

1916
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:22,320
I think you have
the wrong house.

1917
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,916
In the Algiers Motel case,

1918
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:26,792
both the prosecution
and the defense

1919
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,313
in their opening statements

1920
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:31,472
reminded the all-white jury
of the racial violence

1921
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:33,471
that seared Detroit
two summers ago.

1922
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:35,994
Now, Mr. Reed,
before the police

1923
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:39,277
or military personnel
started firing,

1924
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:42,318
to your knowledge, had there
been any sniper fire

1925
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:45,710
from inside the Algiers Motel
or annex?

1926
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:47,559
No.

1927
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:51,236
And did you see anyone
in the motel that night

1928
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:52,833
with a gun of any kind
in their hand

1929
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:55,912
outside of police officers
or military personnel?

1930
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:02,399
I saw someone shoot a toy gun
at one of his friends.

1931
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:05,759
A toy gun.

1932
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:11,675
Mr. Reed.

1933
01:57:12,280 --> 01:57:15,033
Isn't it a fact that your head

1934
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:17,111
was against the wall
for most of the evening?

1935
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:18,793
No, sir, it is not.

1936
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:22,034
My hands were against the wall
for most of the evening.

1937
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:23,348
That's a fact.

1938
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:24,509
I asked about your head.

1939
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:29,118
My head is attached
to my neck.

1940
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:33,476
It moves. This way, and that.

1941
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:40,033
And yet, it cannot
turn completely around

1942
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,599
to see what's behind you?

1943
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:44,513
Unless you have
a special skill

1944
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:46,113
this courtroom
should know about?

1945
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:51,790
You said you saw the flash
before you heard the gunshot.

1946
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,152
Was that your testimony?

1947
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,638
Well, it was pretty confusing.

1948
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:57,976
Well, which is it?
Which came first?

1949
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,228
Did you see the flash?

1950
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:01,276
When did you hear the body
hit the floor?

1951
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:02,429
I can't say for sure.

1952
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,829
You said you were
just outside the door.

1953
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:07,673
You also said
you might be confused,

1954
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,352
that you don't know
what point in time

1955
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:10,440
these things happened.

1956
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,676
So, are you confused?

1957
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:14,816
I saw the flash,
just through the door.

1958
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:16,239
What I need to know is,

1959
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,833
did you see Aubrey Pollard

1960
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,751
make a threatening move
toward my client?

1961
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:23,355
Or are you perhaps confused
on that point as well?

1962
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,188
Yes, sir.

1963
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,836
Being a military man,

1964
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:36,598
you would be able
to distinguish

1965
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:38,557
between the uniforms
of a National Guardsman

1966
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:41,200
and that of a Detroit police officer.
Is that correct?

1967
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,759
I suppose.

1968
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:43,955
And so you say

1969
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:46,176
that the man who took one of
the victims into the room,

1970
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:48,270
that he was
a National Guardsman?

1971
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:49,918
So I presume
you know that because

1972
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,275
he was wearing a uniform
of the National Guard.

1973
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:55,557
Well, yes. I saw a guy in
uniform take him back there.

1974
01:58:56,360 --> 01:58:58,669
Did you see anybody else
go back into that room?

1975
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:00,674
No.

1976
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,316
Would you have been
able to see

1977
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,550
if anybody else
went back into that room?

1978
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:08,916
At the time, wasn't your head
turned back around

1979
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,115
by the police officers

1980
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,792
that were still
standing there with you?

1981
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:15,469
Yes.

1982
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:17,553
And so in one of the lineups,

1983
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:20,074
when you were asked to identify
the officers who beat you,

1984
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:21,559
who did you identify?

1985
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:24,234
Do you see him
here today in court?

1986
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,035
Him.

1987
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:29,674
And him.

1988
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:33,914
You just identified
two of the defendants.

1989
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,351
Why would you identify
only one of them

1990
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,515
at the time of the lineup

1991
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:39,636
if both of them took part
in beating you?

1992
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,591
Which recollection
for the record

1993
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:43,360
would you say
is the correct recollection?

1994
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,072
I just said
I couldn't tell at first.

1995
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:47,376
When I went down to the police
station, I was very nervous.

1996
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:49,755
And so now, you are calm?

1997
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:52,680
And you will not be changing
your story again then?

1998
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:55,096
This is it? This is the one
you want us to work with?

1999
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:56,348
Objection. Asked and answered.

2000
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:57,668
Overruled.

2001
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:00,752
So you were led into a
room, and then what happened?

2002
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,749
He fired off a shot
by my head and told me

2003
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:08,795
to keep my mouth shut
and lay still.

2004
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:10,838
Or the next one for real.

2005
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:12,273
And what did you do?

2006
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:15,599
I lie still.

2007
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:18,474
And were you mistreated
in any way after that?

2008
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:20,509
Mistreated?

2009
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:22,636
Have you ever been
arrested, sir?

2010
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:27,674
Sure.

2011
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:29,478
Ever spent
a night in jail?

2012
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:32,709
Yeah.

2013
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:34,256
How many times
have you been arrested?

2014
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:37,078
I don't know. How many
nights and days have you spent

2015
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:38,656
in prison for crimes
you've committed...

2016
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,829
I don't know, a few.

2017
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,016
...or alleged
to have committed?

2018
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:42,314
Criminal acts.

2019
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:47,078
I don't know. A few.

2020
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:50,478
Are you certain?

2021
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:52,915
Yeah, you don't forget
a beating like that.

2022
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,594
So you're certain
that these three men

2023
02:00:55,680 --> 02:00:57,272
beat you and the others?

2024
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,753
Yes, I'm certain.

2025
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:04,037
Up until some army guy
pulled me in a room

2026
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:05,758
and told me to lie still.

2027
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:07,816
Then you heard him go out
and tell them I was dead.

2028
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,296
And this is
what's being referred to

2029
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:10,719
as the "death game"?

2030
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:13,158
What did you see next?

2031
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,875
I didn't see nothin' lying
face down on the floor,

2032
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:18,757
but I heard Aubrey yell,
"Don't shoot."

2033
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:20,637
And he shot. I heard that.

2034
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:27,336
Your witness, council.

2035
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,954
Now we've already
talked to your cohort about,

2036
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:32,235
friend, Lee,
about his criminal past.

2037
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,840
Have you ever had trouble
with the law?

2038
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:36,878
I'm not on trial here.

2039
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,760
No need to introduce
a new crime, sir.

2040
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,153
Just the ones already known.

2041
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:44,037
Or maybe you can start
by telling us,

2042
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:45,792
how did the night begin?

2043
02:01:45,880 --> 02:01:47,199
Party? A few drinks?

2044
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:49,959
Man, why? Why y'all talking
about me at all?

2045
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:51,553
Man, y'all see
a black man in court

2046
02:01:51,640 --> 02:01:52,856
and assume
I'm the one on trial.

2047
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,155
Man, they killed
my friends, man!

2048
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:56,468
They beat us!

2049
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:58,835
Lined us up and abused us and
y'all doing the same thing!

2050
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:02,233
There's no justice here, man.
Go fuck yourself, man.

2051
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:09,536
- Man, no, get off of me!
- Take him out.

2052
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:10,600
This is bullshit!

2053
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,398
What? What you lookin' at?

2054
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:15,439
This is bullshit!

2055
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:19,152
I think what is clear here,
Your Honor,

2056
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:22,630
is that these men were under
an intolerable situation.

2057
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:25,439
They were under this duress,
which we say was inherent,

2058
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,351
and for that reason,
had no other choice.

2059
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,509
All right.

2060
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,352
All they had to do
was keep quiet.

2061
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:32,476
If they kept quiet,
they wouldn't be here today.

2062
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:34,193
But they made a statement,

2063
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:35,840
and that statement
should be admissible.

2064
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:38,349
Not if they were
made under duress, Your Honor.

2065
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:39,880
Not if the taking
of those statements

2066
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:41,751
violates
constitutional rights.

2067
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:46,273
These policemen
were owed an obligation.

2068
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:50,317
Advising them that they had
a right to remain silent,

2069
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,038
they had a right to counsel,

2070
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:54,350
and that anything they said
could be used against them

2071
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:55,919
in a court of law.

2072
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:57,879
I don't think
these defendants,

2073
02:02:57,960 --> 02:02:59,871
because
they're police officers,

2074
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:02,520
have any right to expect
anything more from us,

2075
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:04,917
but they have a right
under the Constitution

2076
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,434
not to settle
for anything less.

2077
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:12,116
I therefore rule
the statements inadmissible.

2078
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:14,437
Wasn't that just
a load of bullshit.

2079
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:15,748
Whew.

2080
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,273
Wow, man.

2081
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,234
That was...

2082
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:21,197
You know as well I do,

2083
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:23,629
those kids shouldn't have been
killed like that.

2084
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,990
Yeah. It's a shame.

2085
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:31,872
Should've complied
with a lawful order

2086
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:33,632
and relinquish their weapons.

2087
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,912
But you're
a solid guy though.

2088
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,274
Really.

2089
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,555
They know
what they're supposed to do.

2090
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:50,956
Jury entering. All rise.

2091
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:00,192
All rise.

2092
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:19,117
Has the jury reached
a verdict in this matter,

2093
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:20,753
with regard
to the charges of murder

2094
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,632
in the first degree
and assault?

2095
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:24,718
We have, Your Honor.

2096
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,078
On the assault,

2097
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,074
not guilty.

2098
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:37,108
As to the murder charges,

2099
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:42,917
not guilty.

2100
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:53,717
What we have witnessed today is a
disappointment to the justice system,

2101
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:54,915
to the state of Michigan.

2102
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,040
Excuse me,
would you like to comment?

2103
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:59,395
This wouldn't have happened
if they had found black girls

2104
02:05:59,480 --> 02:06:01,118
in a hotel with white men.

2105
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:03,231
No, sir. No way
would they do this

2106
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:04,639
to white men.
That's the truth!

2107
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:05,976
And I don't care
who knows it!

2108
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,231
Thank you, ma'am. Mr. Pollard, how
do you feel about losing your son?

2109
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:10,594
How do you think he feels?

2110
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:12,591
How would you feel?
How would you feel?

2111
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:14,991
It's a terrible pain.

2112
02:06:15,680 --> 02:06:17,456
- A pain that never goes away.
- Come on.

2113
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:18,595
Thanks, man.

2114
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:20,136
Listen, sir,
will you conduct yourself

2115
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,388
with a little bit of empathy?

2116
02:06:21,480 --> 02:06:22,799
We are here today to witness

2117
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:24,416
the justice system
at work and we demand

2118
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:27,716
that police criminality
be treated the exact same way

2119
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,432
as any other form
of criminality.

2120
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:30,816
Some people
would say it's wrong

2121
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:32,296
to judge the police
for doing their jobs.

2122
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:33,548
Nice try.

2123
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:35,256
- You have my statement.
- What a shame.

2124
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,236
Police criminality
needs to be treated

2125
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:40,352
the same as any other
form of criminality.

2126
02:06:57,040 --> 02:07:01,636
Some people
are made of plastic

2127
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:07,394
You know some people
are made of wood

2128
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:13,352
Some people
have hearts of stone

2129
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:18,874
Some people are up to
no good Some people

2130
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:22,040
But baby

2131
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:25,233
I'm for real

2132
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:30,909
I'm as real
as real can get

2133
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:37,715
And if what you're looking
for is real lovin '

2134
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:40,432
Then what you see

2135
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:42,912
Is what you get

2136
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:46,876
We have
a contract, Larry.

2137
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,631
We gotta snatch
this, brother.

2138
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:54,759
Not like this.

2139
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,758
Look, Motown
is a black-only company.

2140
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,637
Oh, but you know what I mean.

2141
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,911
Who listens to this music?

2142
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:07,077
This ain't easy for me, man.

2143
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:16,070
We all a long way from easy.

2144
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,158
Well, then you do
what you need.

2145
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:23,954
I'm gonna lay low.

2146
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:26,839
Come on, man.

2147
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,834
Excuse me, brother.
Yes, son.

2148
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:44,309
I submitted an application
for the church choir director

2149
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:46,635
and I never heard
anything back.

2150
02:10:46,720 --> 02:10:49,075
Oh, um,
speak to the choirmaster.

2151
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:51,114
Okay, thank you.

2152
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,353
Excuse me.

2153
02:10:56,440 --> 02:10:58,536
I submitted an application
for the church choir director

2154
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:00,516
and I never heard
anything back.

2155
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:01,794
Larry Cleveland Reed.

2156
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:03,639
Larry. Uh...

2157
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:05,915
Oh, I remember.
You're with The Dramatics, right?

2158
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,149
Yes, sir.

2159
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:08,719
You're a little bit
overqualified.

2160
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:11,712
We're just
a neighborhood church.

2161
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:14,400
Well, yeah,
I am overqualified. So?

2162
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:16,596
Why don't you go try some
of those clubs downtown?

2163
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:18,756
I'm sure they'd be happy
to have you.

2164
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:21,115
And I guarantee you,
the pay will be much better.

2165
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:24,510
There's police
at those clubs downtown.

2166
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:27,512
And it's dangerous.

2167
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:32,953
Sir, can you please help me?
I need a job.

2168
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:37,113
Do you sing
any liturgical music?

2169
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:40,636
Yeah, I know something.

2170
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:47,958
Let me see if I...

2171
02:11:48,640 --> 02:11:50,870
Okay.

2172
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,199
Master

2173
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,630
The tempest is raging

2174
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:06,997
Oh the billows

2175
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:13,757
Are tossing high

2176
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:19,998
The sky

2177
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:26,634
Is overshadowed
with blackness

2178
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:35,198
No shelter or help

2179
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:39,474
Is nigh

2180
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:48,153
Carest thou not

2181
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:53,269
That we perish?

2182
02:12:55,920 --> 02:13:02,871
How can thou lie asleep

2183
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:11,640
When each moment

2184
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:17,878
So madly is threatening

2185
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:23,675
Oh a grave
A grave

2186
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:27,275
A grave
A grave

2187
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:31,319
In the angry deep

2188
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:34,955
Get up, Jesus
Because

2188

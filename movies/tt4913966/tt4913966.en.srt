Okay, okay, look.
Just keep the case.

check in with patrol.

She took from him

She murdered their children.

329

In a fit of jealous rage,
she drowned them in the river.

was the religious one, not me.

I know things are a little bit

And I know that the world
sometimes seems scary.

remember what
Daddy used to say?

About if you were scared
and he wasn't there?

He'd tell you
to hold onto to Misty

really tight.

Does it feel any better?

It's about Patricia Alvarez.

We know that she had

want to see me.

ever taught me is that...

They will. Soon.

No, Patricia...

You know, when my boys died,

00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:12,954
I didn't pray to God
for their salvation.

523

[Anna] I know it sounds

641
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,829
[Father Perez]
A few years ago,

642
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:24,966
I placed little stock
in legends, myths,

643
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,171
things that go
bump in the night.

644
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,372
But then

645
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,042
there was an incident

646
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:35,146
with a doll.

647
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:42,517
It opened my mind

648
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,789
to possibilities
out of the ordinary.

649
00:53:45,988 --> 00:53:47,257
Can you help us?

650
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:51,992
The Church works with people

651
00:53:51,994 --> 00:53:54,829
who specialize
in situations like this.

652
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,097
Okay.

653
00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:00,036
But to get to them, we'd have
to go through the archdiocese.

654
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:03,838
How long does that take?

655
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,544
At its best, several weeks
for a case to be approved.

656
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:13,517
[Anna] No.

657
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,619
There may be another way.

658
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:20,992
It's unorthodox,
but he's local.

659
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:24,294
However,
if you choose this route,

660
00:54:25,628 --> 00:54:27,562
I must obey
the laws of the Church,

661
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,631
and remove myself
from this process.

662
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:34,269
As I said,
his methods are unorthodox.

663
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,437
And the Church, well,

664
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,573
the Church has their ways,
and he has his.

665
00:54:39,575 --> 00:54:42,914
It's why he abandoned
the collar years ago.

666
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:45,113
He used to be a priest.

667
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,117
Yes.

668
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,151
But now, he's a faith healer.

669
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:53,053
A shaman who operates

670
00:54:53,055 --> 00:54:55,927
on the fringes
of religion and science.

671

00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:20,649
The Alvarez memorial.

677
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,919
Yes?

678
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:25,019
Yes. I was her case worker.

679
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,521
Well, if you've come just to
gawk at my shop,

680
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:30,327
I have more
important things to do.

681
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:32,626
You know what,
I don't think that

682
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:33,995
we're in the right spot.
I'm sorry.

683
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,332
Come on, guys.

684
00:55:41,637 --> 00:55:42,639
Have you seen this before?

685
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:44,705
Yes.

686
00:55:44,707 --> 00:55:45,943
What is it?

687
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,142
The Church can help you.

688
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:51,181
No, no, no, please. The Church
sent us here, to you.

689
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,585
This is Church business.

690
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,122
Please.

691
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:13,535
[Rafael] These are the marks
of <i>La Llorona.</i>

692
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,473
You have seen her then?

693
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,142
[Anna] You ever seen her?

694
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,146
No.

695
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,181
Not directly.

696
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,184
But I have seen what she does.

697
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,686
What do we do?

698
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:35,392
We are facing an evil
that has no bounds.

699
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,629
But she's not human. Right?

700
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,635
No. But she was,

701
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:50,540
until her murderous vanity
consumed her.

702
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,441
She's just a dark spirit.

703
00:56:54,443 --> 00:56:56,510
Unholy. Forsaken by God.

704
00:56:56,512 --> 00:56:58,479
Okay, that's it. I'm gonna
take them to a motel.

705
00:56:58,481 --> 00:56:59,615
Why?

706
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:04,452
She's attached herself to
your family, not your house.

707
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,425
If you move,
she will follow you.

708
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:11,128
What are we supposed
to do then?

709
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,369
I don't think
that's gonna help.

710
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:24,374
No. Not just this.

711
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,246
At the memorial,

712
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:34,615
I saw you speaking
with Father Perez.

713
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,619
He said that
you used to be a priest.

714
00:57:39,488 --> 00:57:41,624
My journey
began in the Church.

715
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:44,661
Yes.

716
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:49,199
That was a long time ago.

717
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,474
Take me to your home.
We must begin immediately.

718
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,912
We're done.

719
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:08,216
I'm sorry, are you just gonna
rub eggs all over everything?

720
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,421
You think it's silly,
don't you?

721
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:12,555
Pretty much.

722
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,459
Come with me.

723
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,428
This ritual, <i>la limpia,</i>

724
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,767
is used to detect
the presence of evil.

725
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:30,204
The bloodier the content,

726
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:32,308
the greater the evil.

727

Did you see that on <i>Carson?</i>

733
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,104
No.

[muttering prayer]

740
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:20,381
That cross was carved
from a tree in Mexico.

741
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,316
It blooms with red blossoms

742
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,919
that make it look like
it's on fire.

[speaks Spanish]

744

The fire tree.

745
01:00:30,626 --> 01:00:32,162
[in English] They say

746
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,229
the fire trees wept

747
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:36,930
as <i>La Llorona</i>
drowned her children.

748
01:00:36,932 --> 01:00:39,767
As the only witness
to her sins,

749
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,573
they hold a special power
over her.

What is that?

754
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,276
[Rafael]
The tears of <i>La Llorona.</i>

755
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:23,479
I've sanctified them.

756

Why?

757
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,617
Antivenom.

[thunder rumbling]

759
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,640
Is that another ritual?

760
01:01:53,642 --> 01:01:56,347
Yes. Breakfast for dinner.

761
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,747
That was David's thing.

762
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,550
Breakfast for dinner.
I used to always tease him

763
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,785
it was 'cause cereal
was the only thing

You don't seem very confident.

I'm confident in God.

770
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:20,635
Father Perez said you turned
your back on the Church.

The Church? Yes.

Watch the flames.

A steady flame tells us

that our protective charms
are working.

779

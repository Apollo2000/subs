<i>Government sources tell us</i>

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:11,669
<i>the world's energy resources will be
fully exhausted within five years.</i>

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,599
<i>...space station was completed today.</i>

4
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,975
<i>Designed for a risky experimental mission.</i>

5
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:31,651
<i>Onboard the orbiting lab
is the Shephard Particle Accelerator.</i>

6
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,864
<i>If the astronauts can
get the Shephard working</i>

7
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,567
<i>it would produce free energy,</i>

8
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,869
<i>solving the Earth's energy crisis forever.</i>

9
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,747
<i>...as French officials announce
new energy rationing provisions that...</i>

10

<i>...dissolutions of

11

<i>are setting the stage for armed conflict</i>

12

<i>as the global energy crisis worsens.</i>

13
00:00:56,682 --> 00:01:00,426
<i>...is really a drain of financial
and energy resources that can...</i>

14
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,205
- Yeah.
<i>- ...and should be put to better use.</i>

15
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,229
I'll tell him.

16
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,565
Okay.

17
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:07,275
Thanks.

18
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:09,694
Did you move at all?

19
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,398
Forward or side to side?

20
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,275
Joe says you owe him a call.

21
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,657
Did he ask you?

22
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,483
I feel like honking the horn.

23
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,737
Yeah, 'cause that's gonna
make us loads of new friends.

24
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,575
Are you serious? Stop. Stop.

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,286
Started a trend.

26
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,417
Come on, that's like
the fourth blackout today.

27
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:34,969
Fifth.

28
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:38,848
Did he ask you?

29
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,143
And?

30
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:43,561
You know what I said.

31
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,852
I'm not leaving you,
that mission could be years.

32
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,579
You said you could be back in six months.

33
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,772
Do you want me to go?

34
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,262
Joe knows what we've been through.

35
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,379
And yet, he still wants you on the crew.

36
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,927
- There are other comm officers.
- Yeah, but he called you.

37
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,032
Why are you pushing this?

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,155
Why do you think?

39
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,656
Forget about me and what I want.

40
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,578
Which is for you to stay.

41
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,212
Why do you think?

42
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,377
Because you're sweet.

43
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,724
Because people are starving.

44
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,431
Because our energy supplies
are running out.

45
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,352
And this mission could unlock
an endless supply of power

46
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,687
that could save us all.

47
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,283
If you go...

48
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,786
you and I...

49
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,621
we'll survive.

50
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,207
I'm afraid if you don't...

51
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,254
no one will.

52
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,039
<i>TAD throttle control, 8636.</i>

53
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,501
<i>Line secure.</i>

00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,953
<i>Accelerator system status?</i>

00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,296
<i>Holding for pre-ignition.</i>

00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,710
<i>Shephard team, you are go for countdown.</i>

57
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,172
<i>Play ball, got our fingers crossed here
at Mission Control.</i>

58
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,885
<i>Let's make this first one count.</i>

59
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,802
<i>- Status, boosters?
- Go.</i>

60
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,306
<i>- The GNC?
- Go.</i>

61
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,397
<i>Power up.</i>

62
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,935
<i>Commander, Shephard team
standing by for your go.</i>

63
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,864
<i>On my count.</i>

64
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,324
<i>Three...</i>

65
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,951
<i>two...</i>

66
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,115
<i>one. Full mark.</i>

67
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,022
Huntsville, this is Commander Kiel.

68
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,189
Firing has failed.

69
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,206
<i>Morning, beautiful.</i>

70
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,957
Sorry I woke you.

71
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,421
<i>No. Look.</i>

72
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,802
I'm working.

73
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,594
I've got a patient today

74
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,431
with camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa
vara-pericarditis syndrome.

75
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,017
What's that?

76
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,943
<i>I'll let you know
after I've done my homework.</i>

77
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,735
I'm getting sick of only
seeing you on a screen.

78
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:05,985
You okay?

79
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,277
<i>Yeah.</i>

80
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,456
<i>It's the rest of the world
I'm worried about.</i>

81
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,774
<i>I mean, you see the same news that I do.</i>

82
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,827
<i>It's madness.</i>

83
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,037
<i>Oil wars are spreading.</i>

84
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,264
<i>Russia's threatening ground invasion now.</i>

85
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,168
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

86
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,128
<i>Ground invasion, which will only
waste all their oil reserves.</i>

87
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,631
Anyway...

88
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,250
normal life is hanging by a thread.

89
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,090
You?

90
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,349
We're all on edge.

91
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,641
And we only have enough fuel
for three more firings.

92
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,565
<i>I remember.</i>

93
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,643
If this doesn't work, I can't even
think about what happens down there.

94
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,405
I don't think any of us are feeling...

95
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,576
hopeful.

96
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,202
I miss you more every day.

97
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,332
Like I miss them.

98
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,201
<i>And maybe I'm an idiot...</i>

99
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,130
<i>but I'm hopeful.</i>

100
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,352
<i>And notj ust for the work
that you're doing.</i>

101
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,343
<i>We can't go back in time</i>

102
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,010
<i>and know what we know now.</i>

103
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,184
<i>But I was thinking...</i>

104
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,643
<i>maybe when you get back...</i>

105
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,473
<i>Welcome to</i> American Sunrise...

106
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,516
<i>As we open today...</i>

107
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,774
Two-one.

108
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,625
Tell Mission Control we're effective
because we are not wimps.

109
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,220
Shit.

110
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,765
Six hundred and ninety-four.

111
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,059
Six hundred and ninety-four days

112
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,814
I've kept our O2, CO2, N2, hydrogen,
water vapor and methane

113
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,190
at optimal levels.

114
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,873
Do you know how many
pressure leaks we've had?

115
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,950
Not one.

116
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,950
No microbe overgrowth, nothing.

117
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,948
- You know why?
- This is a long speech, Volkov.

118
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,451
Because I disinfect the decks
every 72 hours.

119
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,740
I disinfect the decks, actually.

120
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,701
If you have a point, I'd make it now.

121
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,287
There's one part of this station,
one part,

122
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,088
that is not working. This is interesting.

123
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,381
Do you know what part that is?

124
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,753
The Shephard Accelerator.

125
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,836
There are 8 billion people counting on us.
What are you saying?

126
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,502
I don't have a problem with you.

127
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,052
But your little German boyfriend
over here I do.

128
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,007
Go back to your quarters.

129
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,219
Don't treat me like
you're my mother. You're not.

130
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,415
- Okay, that's enough.
- Hey, chill out, Volky.

131
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,603
Two years on this station
and this man has delivered nothing.

132
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,693
Volkov!

133
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,191
You need to think very carefully
about what you're saying.

134
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,985
We both heard the reports.

135
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,368
Germany is preparing for war.

136
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,155
And every day that goes by,

137
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,490
more and more Russians are starving.

138
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,165
Maybe you're not in such a hurry
to get the Shephard working?

139
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,517
Easy!

140
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,217
Easy!

141
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,428
This stops now!

142
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,521
If we can't keep our shit together
up here,

143
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,487
how can we ever expect them
to do it down there?

144
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,776
- Maybe they won't!
- Keep your mouth shut!

145
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,398
We have a job to do.

146
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,701
<i>Another test aboard
the Cloverfield Space Station,</i>

147
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,078
<i>the 47th test in just over two years,</i>

150
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,831
<i>This is Huntsville,
we've got eyes and ears.</i>

151
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,924
Morning, Huntsville.

152
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,264
Copy that.

153
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,881
Schmidt, system status?

154
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,142
Green across the board.

155
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,515
<i>Right this minute, they're testing
a particle accelerator up there</i>

156
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,690
<i>so we can learn how to make
unlimited energy down here.</i>

157
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,770
<i>But those who've accepted
the Cloverfield Paradox is real</i>

158
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,354
<i>know how dangerous that is...</i>

159
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,134
- Shepard holding for pre-ignition.
- Commander,

160
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,195
Shepard team standing by for your go.

161
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,617
Diagnostic mode off.

162
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,365
X-Deck modification complete.

163

Stabilizer active.

00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,076
Qinhuangdao, confirm pre-ignition
sequencing authorization.

165
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,662
You're a go for accelerator pre-ignition.

166
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,874
Huntsville and Qinhuangdao,
Control will call you post-blackout.

167
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,924
<i>- Copy.
- Standby for protocol go.</i>

168
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,011
<i>Why does the Shepard Accelerator
worry you so much?</i>

169
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,048
<i>Because that accelerator is
a thousand times more powerful</i>

170
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,179
<i>than any ever built.
Every time they test it,</i>

171
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,683
<i>they risk ripping open
the membrane of space-time,</i>

172
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:03,021
<i>smashing together multiple dimensions,
shattering reality.</i>

173
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,149
<i>And not just on that station, everywhere.</i>

174
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,073
<i>This experiment could unleash chaos,</i>

175
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,155
<i>the likes of which we have never seen.</i>

176
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,239
<i>Monsters, demons, beasts from the sea...</i>

177
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,573
<i>To clarify,</i>

178
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,909
<i>you believe their efforts
to solve the energy crisis</i>

179
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,743
<i>might unleash demons?</i>

180
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,329
<i>Yeah. Oh, yeah.</i>

181
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,423
Volkov.

182
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,150
<i>We're ready to take the Shepard online.</i>

183
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,217
<i>How's your station?</i>

184
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,048
Hold on, I'm calibrating
our expensive compass.

185
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,470
<i>And not just here and now.</i>

186
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,931
<i>In the past, in the future,</i>

187
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,716
<i>in other dimensions.</i>

188
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,596
<i>You have no idea how much
I would love to be wrong about this.</i>

189
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,273
- Monk, turn that shit off.
<i>- If you wanna know more,</i>

190
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,725
<i>please, read my book...</i>

191
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,361
Gyro is calibrating.

192
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:51,774
My station is good.

193
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,447
Should ask Schmidt, is his station good?

194
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,986
Jesus Christ.

195
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,823
Please, Mr. Monk,
hit us with your holy stick.

196
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,997
Oh, come on.

197
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,929
- Not now, that we really need...
- Schmidt.

198
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,671
The farther we travel from home,
the clearer it becomes

199
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,632
that there is a power
infinitely greater than us.

200
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,721
Please show your mercy.

201
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,895
And allow the Shephard to work this time.

202
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,898
To provide the energy we need...

203
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,320
to prevent our countries
from going to war.

204
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,076
Please, God, be on our side.

205
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,704
Amen.

206
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,332
Amen.

207
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,709
That was righteous.

208
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,844
Back to work.

209
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,346
Sunday school over yet?

210
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,097
Schmidt, power up.

211
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,232
Sequence running.

212
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,229
Thirty to ignition.

213
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,198
Commander?

214
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,537
Three...

215
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,913
two...

216
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,162
one...

217
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,249
mark.

218
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,417
Please, don't break up on me, baby.

219
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,899
Yes. Yes, yes!

220
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,483
We have a successful collision.

221
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,494
What's our output?

222
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,034
We have positive energy flow
for the first time.

223
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,373
Look at this! Look at this!

224
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,126
- Holy shit, you did it!
- It's working.

225
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,920
We are focused at 47 teravolts.

226
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,249
- Oh, man!
- Hamilton, viewscreen mode.

227
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,128
- Yes, man!
- Look at that!

228
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,423
Oh, yeah.

229
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,766
Oh, that's pretty.

230
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,646
- Schmidt, tell me something.
- It says it hit 602...

231
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,407
What the hell is happening?

232
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,882
- Shit, everyone up!
- Hey!

233
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,976
Come on.

234
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,602
Extinguisher systems are down!

235
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,815
Then we ventilate.

236
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,198
Dammit!

237
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,274
I need 63M open now!

238
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,612
Oh, no.

239
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,659
Something's wrong here, guys.
It's all scrambled.

240
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,303
Qinhuangdao, do you copy?

241
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,010
The O2 tanks are leaking.

242
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,977
Our reserves are severely diminished.

243
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,264
- Qinhuangdao, do you copy?
- The systems are scrambled.

244
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,395
There is absolutely no guarantee

245
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,568
any executable will function as expected.

246
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,065
I'm rebooting the comms system.

247
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,487
I'm not picking up anything.

248
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,325
Okay, what else?

249
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,530
Life support at 74 percent.

250
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,661
Main power is fried, this is backup.

251
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,496
Temperature is all over the place

252
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,199
and nothing gets better until
Mundy and I get our hands on it.

253
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,824
We got the gear to fix all this?

254
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,043
Not by a long shot.

255
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,211
Then request an ECL.

256
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,150
- Get 'em to send some supplies.
- Just doesn't make any sense.

257
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,819
The device was outputting
a massive amount of energy.

258
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:19,963
Tam, please kill that alarm.

259
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,939
But then there was some kind
of malfunction.

260
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,407
Really, Schmidt? There was a malfunction?

261
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,431
Kiel.

262
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,016
It isn't there.

263
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,602
The frequency for Mission Control?

264
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,939
The Earth.

265
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,476
I can't find anything.

266
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,320
We must have gotten turned around,
moved during firing.

267
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,815
It's big, blue, full of angry people.

268
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,115
Keep looking, you'll find it.

269
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,659
I've double checked the radio target
but the target's gone.

270
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,533
Guys, the systems are scrambled.

271
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:49,998
Hamilton's right.

272
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,374
It's...

273
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,751
It's not here.

274
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,914
We're not picking up any signals.

275
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,496
The entire Earth is not gone.

276
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,876
Cycle the external cameras.

277
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,508
All of them.

278
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,689
Wait, are we saying this thing of his

279
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,945
could have thrown us across the galaxy?

280
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,734
We knew it was dangerous.

281
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,536
That's why we had to go up in space
to fire this thing.

282
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,831
No, come on.

283
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,208
Bullshit.

284
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:50,767
No.

285
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,581
<i>You did this.</i>

286
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,701
<i>I never trusted you.</i>

287
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,456
<i>We all did this.</i>

288
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,660
<i>The Earth is gone!</i>

289
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,189
<i>Are you sure we've checked everything?</i>

290
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,045
<i>Mundy, you've asked that question
six times.</i>

291
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,484
<i>Well, it's a good bloody question,
isn't it?</i>

292
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,419
<i>This is your fault!</i>

293
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,736
<i>Of course you're blaming me for this.</i>

294
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,029
<i>Who else made this happen? Who else?</i>

295
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,693
<i>We've been working on this for two years.</i>

296
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,241
<i>- You knew the risks.
- Volkov's right.</i>

297
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,130
<i>The Earth is gone.</i>

298
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,136
<i>- You don't know this.
- Somehow, we did it.</i>

299
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,967
<i>Look out any goddamn window.</i>

300
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,247
<i>Maybe we're missing something.</i>

301
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,271
<i>We're missing the Earth.</i>

302
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,688
<i>This is our fault.</i>

303
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,740
All right, here's what we're up against.

304
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,823
The station's got problems
we don't have tools to fix.

305
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,906
At this point, looking for home
is a luxury for us.

306
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,740
First, we need to survive.

307
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,121
We need to consider, evidence or not...

308
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,255
that we might have ended the lives
of billions of people.

309
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,874
We didn't destroy the Earth.

310
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,259
We just... lost it.

311
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,967
Totally routine day. Copy that.

312
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,265
Mundy, take Schmidt and deal with the O2.

313
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,432
I'm a physicist.

314
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,639
And now, you work for Mundy.

315
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,178
Your lucky day.

316
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,939
Tam, you and Monk are gonna search
and repair all power leaks.

317
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,062
Maybe we can get this temperature
under control.

318
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,230
Hamilton, Volkov, test all circuits.
Then we can start looking for home.

319
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,905
When the Shepard overloaded...

320
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,197
something went wrong
with the station's orientation system.

321
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,430
We're gonna replace the circuits.

322
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,491
No shit. If that's the problem, but...

323
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,118
it might be the gyro.

324
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,875
Then let's get that fancy compass fixed.

325
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,298
- Volkov?
- Yes?

326
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,780
I found the problem with the gyro.

327
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,804
What? It's fried?

328
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,098
It's not here.

329
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,753
What do you mean "it's not here"?

330
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,141
I secured this when we fired the ship.

331
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,207
This look okay?

332
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,609
Tam.

333
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:56,948
Tam?

334
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,409
You all right?

335
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,383
What is that?

336
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,212
It's coming from inside the wall.

337
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,302
- In the wall?
- No...

338
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,907
- Walls don't make noises like that.
- We have to open it.

339
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,888
- Open it?
- Volkov, get the tools.

340
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,011
Volky!

341
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,935
Okay, before you rip off that panel
and damage God-knows-what,

342
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,101
can we at least discuss it?

343
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,142
Mundy's right. It could be dangerous.

344
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,144
We should open it.

345
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,066
- No, we're not!
- You forget about it.

346
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,153
Stop!

347
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,773
We're doing this.

348
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,570
All right. Good luck.

349
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,294
Three, two, one...

350
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,804
- We're here. We've got you.
- Hold on. Hold on.

351
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,185
- We have to cut her free.
- We can't cut anything.

352
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,170
Those lines going through her body
are power lines.

353
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,713
- She's dying in there.
- Mundy, shut the power off.

354
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,922
- She's hurt, we can't leave her.
- Hold on!

355
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,027
She's dying!

356
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,758
We don't have a choice,
we've gotta cut her out.

357
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,570
We have a choice. Stop it!
We don't know what that is.

358
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,783
Shut it off!

359
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,389
- We can reroute the power later.
- Won't leave her in there.

360
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,413
Hold on!

361
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Mundy!

362
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,032
Module 17 powered down.

363
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,478
- Okay.
- Just breathe, it's gonna be okay.

364
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,182
Power's down.
All right, let's cut her out.

365
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,878
Monk! She's bleeding out.

366
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,844
I can't do anything
until she's out of the wall.

367
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,550
Help me.

368
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:40,593
Guys, hurry!

369
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,220
Help me.

370
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,132
Hamilton.

371
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,557
Hamilton.

372
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,133
She just said your name.

373
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,343
What's happening to me?

374
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,014
What's happening to me?

375
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,936
What's happening to me?

376
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,026
We're gonna cut you free.

377
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,277
Quick.

378
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,298
- Come on, guys.
- Let's get her out.

379
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,813
Can you hold her leg out of the way?

380
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,528
- Okay.
- Hurry up!

381
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,359
Mundy, the saw! Quick.

382
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,820
Hold on. Stay with me.

383
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,954
- Careful with the pipe.
- That's no good.

384
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,500
Pull her down.

385
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,953
- Careful.
- All right. All right.

386
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,696
- It's gonna be okay.
- Grab her leg.

387
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,007
This is a mistake.

388
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,798
Schmidt, I need more light.

389
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,461
You got her?

390
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,005
- Okay.
- Breathe, breathe.

391
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,135
Okay, okay.

392
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,061
Okay, okay, okay.

393
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,915
Can you get something to strap her down?

394
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,539
- Keep her still.
- All right, all right.

395
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:37,692
Okay.

396
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,878
<i>No official public statement has been made</i>

397
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,006
<i>about what caused the explosion
that was thought, at first,</i>

398
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,507
<i>to be a nuclear weapon.</i>

399
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,547
<i>But we are being assured by authorities,</i>

400
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,348
<i>that is not what this is.</i>

401
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,438
Are you on call?

402
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,023
Good.

403
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,856
Yeah, I saw it.

404
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,521
<i>Keep moving.</i>

405
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,211
Has the hospital issued Code Orange yet?

406
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,943
Shaw said what did it?

407
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,828
Jesus Christ.

408
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,044
- This is madness.
- Calm down.

409
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,918
We can't stay calm.
Not with that woman lying there.

410
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,888
Who is she?
And what the hell is she doing here?

411
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,088
She knew my name.

412
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,419
We're all going mad.

413
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,531
I'm not gonna say it again.

414
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,548
We have to stay focused,
we have other problems to deal with.

415
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,133
Speaking of other problems,

416
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,067
how the hell are we supposed
to find the Earth?

417
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,520
Without the gyro, we're lost.

418
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,809
Any ideas?

419
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,308
'Cause honestly, I'm stumped.

420
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,978
You're assuming Earth is still there.

421
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,482
Earth disappears,
station does not feel the same.

422
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,783
A woman appears in the wall.

423
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,031
We're definitely not in Kentucky anymore.

424
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,536
Kansas.

425
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,114
Kansas. Really?

426
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,081
Who gives a shit?

427
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,993
People from Kansas.

428
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,709
I don't know what's going on.
But one thing is clear,

429
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,386
the Shepard's done it,

430
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,004
which means it might also undo it.

431
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,451
Right now, the integrity
of the station is all that matters.

432
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,933
We have repairs that need to happen
immediately.

433
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,111
Monk will give us an update
when there is one.

434
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,397
Let's get to it.

435
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,574
Meet me at X-Deck in ten minutes.

436
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,584
- Kiel wants me with him...
- I'm done with Kiel.

437
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,629
You and I need to take control
if we're ever going to get home.

438
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,124
Hey. The worms are missing.

439
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,971
Guys?

440
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,515
The worms are gone.

441
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,928
I did, I told you I did.

442
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,930
We have to think about the fact that...

443
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:46,855
Bullshit... no...

444
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,002
...there might be a larger problem.

445
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,045
We're gonna solve this thing.

446
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,230
And what if we can't?

447
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,062
But we will, goddamn it!

448
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,067
Who else can fix this up here?

449
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,907
No one. Now, you focus
and you get your shit together,

450
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,993
you understand me?

451
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,655
Speak to me like that again...

452
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,534
...and you and I will have a bigger problem
than the Shepard.

453
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,205
You copy?

454
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,294
Give me the wrench.

455
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,295
No!

456
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,488
What?

457
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,825
What?

458
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:23,827
Excuse me.

459
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,462
Yes.

460
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,343
I know.

461
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,622
Hey, Schmidt.

462
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,330
Look at these moisture levels.

463
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,797
What are you doing here?

464
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,419
No. What are you two doing up here?

465
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,050
Against Commander's orders.

466
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,802
I don't answer to you, Volkov.

467
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,924
- No?
- No.

468
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,548
Then who are you answering to?

469
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,744
- German intelligence?
- Where did you get that gun from?

470
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,768
Please, put that down.

471
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,102
- Chancellor Gerlach?
- Put that gun down, Volkov.

472
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,224
Did Gerlach gi...

473
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:15,816
Stop it!

474
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,271
Who gave you the wartime orders...

475
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,477
Put the gun down!

476
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,571
You need help, Volkov.

477
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,229
- ...to sabotage the Shepard.
- Drop it!

478
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,440
Are you crazy? Put that gun down!

479
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,380
- Monk!
- Help!

480
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,830
How long has he been like this?

481
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,172
He tried to kill us.

482
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,591
Tam, why do you have a gun?

483
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,420
He came to us on x Deck,
threatened us with this.

484
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,741
- Lock it away.
- Now there's a gun?

485
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,805
Since when is there a gun?

486
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,302
What happened? Monk?

487
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,849
- Whoa.
- What the hell?

488
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,766
Do something, Monk.

489
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:55,937
Monk, what's going on?

490
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,856
- I don't know.
- We have to help him.

491
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,777
- Oh, God.
- No.

492
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,196
No.

493
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,050
Well, we found the worms.

494
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,965
<i>Hamilton, she's awake.</i>

495
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,118
Okay.

496
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,341
Ava.

497
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,585
How are you on this station?

498
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,792
I have the same question for you.

499
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,183
I don't know.

500
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,012
I was heading to X-Deck.

501
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,691
Find Mundy.

502
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:03,984
You know Mundy?

503
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,069
Of course I know Mundy.

504
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,338
We've been on this station for two years.

505
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:11,867
Mundy, Kiel...

506
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,368
Volkov.

507
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,654
Jesus... Christ, Volkov.

508
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,791
Everyone except her.

509
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:25,667
Who is that woman?

510
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,176
Who are you?

511
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,550
What do you mean, who am I?

512
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,014
It's me.

513
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,850
Mina.

514
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,427
Mina Jensen.

515
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,021
I'm the Shepard engineer.

516
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,186
No, Tam...

517
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,564
Tam is the Shepard engineer.

518
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,189
What are you talking about?

519
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,846
What are you even doing here?
You're supposed to be on Earth.

520
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,155
Why would I be on Earth?

521
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,199
Because you're our civilian coordinator.

522
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,111
We trained together since ExoMars Six.

523
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,184
We're friends. I'm your friend.

524
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,324
We've never met.

525
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,084
How can you not know who I am?

526
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,300
None of you know who I am?

527
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:14,972
None of us.

528
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,589
I don't understand.

529
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,931
I don't understand.

530
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,015
I don't understand.

531
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,482
How can you not know me?

532
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,603
How? How can you not know me?

533
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,316
I'm the Shepard engineer.

534
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,589
Listen to me.

535
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:58,849
Ava.

536
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:02,722
Don't trust Schmidt.

537
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,688
What?

538
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,064
It was him.

539
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,974
Schmidt sabotaged the Shepard.

540
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,053
Commander.

541
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:38,889
What's going on?

542
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,808
Have you lost your...

543
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,892
You're making a mistake.

544
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,980
Stay out of this.

545
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,399
Jensen warned us about you.

546
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,779
The woman in the wall?

547
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,232
I checked your communication logs.

548
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,363
- So what?
- We deciphered your messages

549
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:01,453
from the BND.

550
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,537
The BND?

551
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,241
We trusted you!

552
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,198
For two years, Schmidt.

553
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,228
- Two years. Two years.
- What are you talking about, Kiel?

554
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,993
You were ordered by German Intelligence

555
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,581
to keep the Shepard offline
until Russia was neutralized.

556
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,791
- I swear to you on my life...
- I saw the order!

557
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:18,085
- I never received such an order.
- I saw your response.

558
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,173
Have you lost your mind?

559
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,175
Maybe I am losing my mind.

560
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,679
But I'm gonna do everything I can
to keep us alive and get us home.

561
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,688
Until I say otherwise,
this is where you stay.

562
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,810
You're trusting her, and not me?

563
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:34,567
You need me, Kiel!

564
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,149
Kiel!

565
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,783
<i>Citywide destruction has been reported</i>

566
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,657
<i>stretching from the downtown area
to the residential suburbs...</i>

567
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,747
<i>Michael, are you safe?</i>

568
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,282
No, I'm... I'm headed to the hospital.

569
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,743
It's gonna be a mess.

570
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,603
Listen, can you get this message to Ava?

571
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,539
Tell her I'm going to be in triage
for the next 72 hours.

572
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,749
<i>Michael, listen.</i>

573
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,811
<i>We're trying to get
some answers here, but...</i>

574
00:43:59,053 --> 00:43:59,964
<i>It's gone.</i>

575
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,054
<i>The station.</i>

576
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:02,514
<i>We lost signal.</i>

577
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,386
- What?
<i>- I know.</i>

578
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,344
<i>We're scanning everywhere.
It's off comms, off radar.</i>

579
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,518
Did it break apart?

580
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,597
Did the station fail?

581
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:12,691
<i>We don't know.</i>

582
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,467
<i>Look. I promise I'll get back to you
soon as I know anything.</i>

583
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,654
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

584
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:19,573
<i>Just don't lose hope.</i>

585
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,531
<i>I believe it's still up there.</i>

586
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,493
<i>Somewhere.</i>

587
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,407
<i>Michael?</i>

588
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,165
I'll call you back.

589
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,975
Help! Help!

590
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:40,943
Help!

591
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:46,701
Help!

592
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,911
Help! Help!

593
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,512
Oh, shit!

594
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,900
What the...

595
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,361
Help!

596
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,613
Whoa.

597
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:31,871
Jesus.

598
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,662
- Mundy?
- Get me out of here.

599
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:40,964
Help me!

600
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,258
Shit!

601
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:47,095
Help me!

602
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,539
- Hamilton, help me out!
- Kiel, it's pulling me further in.

603
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,598
- Okay.
- Pull me out!

604
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,481
Oh, man.

605
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,943
Has anyone ever seen
anything like that before?

606
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,614
Guys?

607
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,664
Where's my arm?

608
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,501
Where's my bloody arm?

609
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,800
No pain?

610
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:26,885
No.

611
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,086
Not physically.

612
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,967
It's like he was born this way.

613
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,798
Except I wasn't, was I?

614
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,220
He's in shock.

615
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,663
Can you stop talking like I'm a kid
and these are my parents?

616
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,803
Sorry.

617
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,187
I don't know the rules... now.

618
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,134
Do you think there's any chance it...

619
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,573
might grow back?

620
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,286
I don't know.

621
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:55,495
I don't know what to believe anymore.

622
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,308
This your way of apologizing?

623
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,235
Kiel?

624
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,079
Kiel.

625
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,558
I need the whole crew on M-Deck
as fast as you can.

626
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,092
Who let you out of the airlock?

627
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,267
Just get here now.

628
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,649
What is it?

629
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,321
What is that?

630
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:20,076
That's my fucking arm.

631
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:22,876
Hold it quick!

632
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,328
- Come on!
- He's got hold of it.

633
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,250
Easy with it.

634
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,551
Are you controlling it?

635
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,488
'Course I'm not controlling it.
It's over there.

636
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,656
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure

637
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,158
because I'm giving you the finger
right now.

638
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,298
How is that alive?

639
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,007
Logic doesn't apply to any of this.

640
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,763
One thing is clear. The overload did it.

641
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,979
None of us believed it was real.
But this is the paradox.

642
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,064
Excuse me?

643
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,770
Particles interacting with each other
across two dimensions.

644
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,526
Okay, I'm gonna sit down.

645
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:52,320
Two distinct realities in a multiverse,

646
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,398
fighting to occupy the same space.

647
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,941
Creating chaos.

648
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,113
These aren't the things we know.

649
00:49:58,704 --> 00:49:59,785
Because...

650
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,498
they don't belong to us.

651
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,697
Jensen.

652
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,327
My communication logs.

653
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:10,713
Guys, check out my arm.

654
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,160
I think my arm
is trying to write something.

655
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,096
Somebody get a pen. Schmidt.

656
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:23,806
This is madness.

657
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,682
Go. That's creepy.

658
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:33,863
"Cut...

659
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,276
Volkov...

660
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,361
...open"?

661
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,283
What are you talking about, arm?

662
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,051
It's nothing personal, Volky.

663
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,218
Mundy.

664
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,305
What? He's our friend.

665
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,384
He was about to shoot me.

666
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,761
- Well, you know, before that.
- Guys.

667
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,897
Monk?

668
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,648
Sorry, I can't do this.

669
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,142
Come on, you're the doctor.

670
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:13,945
I can handle it.

671
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,560
There's something...

672
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,941
What the...

673
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:02,488
- No way, Jose.
- What the...

674
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,370
Come on.

675
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,635
We're hoping the piece of equipment
you found in someone's stomach

676
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:22,212
is what's gonna save the day.

677
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,015
Good luck, everybody.

678
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:27,392
Putting it on the viewscreen.

679
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,597
Look, there's Cassiopeia.

680
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,066
It's upside down.

681
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,937
We're upside down.

682
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,110
Guys,

683
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,566
we moved and we're upside down.

684
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,106
Check the other side of the sun.

685
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,870
Scanning.

686
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,124
My arm helped us find the Earth.

687
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,674
Targeting all receivers.

688
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,595
Yes!

689
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,599
I'd clap, you know, if I could.

690
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,630
Let's let 'em know we're still here.

691
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,442
We can receive, but we can't transmit.

692
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,048
Let's make that happen as fast as we can.

693
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,439
Let's request a shuttle
and give 'em status on The Shepard.

694
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,240
And have them send us some Champagne.

695
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:25,821
Or some dumplings.

696
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,947
Wait...

697
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:27,948
Guys, listen.

698
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,918
<i>But sources say
the number of those killed today</i>

699
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,411
<i>could be even greater
than the blitz on Berlin.</i>

700
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,584
<i>The 14-month-old European war...</i>

701
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:36,606
- Fourteen months?
<i>- ...shows no sign of resolution.</i>

702
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,838
<i>This, as China sends warships
further West.</i>

703
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,041
Wait, what?
What the hell are they talking about?

704
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,215
What's going on down there?

705
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:43,822
<i>...diplomats from all Chinese embassies.</i>

706
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,213
<i>All this, with nations still reeling</i>

707
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,140
<i>after the destruction
of the Cloverfield Space Station.</i>

708
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,683
Hamilton, is there a video?

709
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,262
<i>...recent attempt to create safe,
renewable energy, the orbiting...</i>

710
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,313
- Oh, my God.
- Viewscreen on.

711
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,234
<i>...experienced a catastrophic failure
just two days ago.</i>

712
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,945
<i>Losing its brave crew of six,</i>

713
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,899
<i>debris from the Cloverfield
has crashed into the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

714
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:07,734
<i>Salvage crews are en route.</i>

715
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,367
<i>President Usman is set to make
a statement from the Rose Garden</i>

716
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,073
<i>at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.</i>

717
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,248
I don't get it.

718
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,243
It's much worse than we thought.

719
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,621
It's not just particles
of two dimensions interacting.

720
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,332
We've traveled to another one.

721
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,962
<i>...are on fire, literally.</i>

722
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,463
To another dimension?

723
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:29,173
<i>People are tearing down houses
for firewood, leading to...</i>

724
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,266
So, hold on.

725
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,346
If that's not our Earth...

726
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,059
can someone please explain to me
how we're supposed to get home.

727
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,391
We have to get the Shepard fixed
and fire it again.

728
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:43,449
What we know about quantum entanglement
dictates it should bring us back.

729
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:45,526
And perhaps undo the damage we've done.

730
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,904
It doesn't matter what Earth that is.

731
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,615
We should go down and get help.

732
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:52,872
We need to go home...

733
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:53,998
To our home.

734
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,995
Look at them. At their war.

735
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,207
That will be us if we don't get back.

736
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,297
I'm with Monk.

737
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,333
I say we go to that Earth,
the one that we can actually see,

738
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,837
and get the hell off this station.

739
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,715
That place cannot save us.

740
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,138
The longer we stay here,
the more dangerous it is.

741
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:11,766
For us

742
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,307
and for everyone back home.

743
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,481
<i>All circuits are busy now.</i>

744
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,054
I can't get through to your home yet.

745
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:30,825
The circuits are busy.

746
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,018
That means no calls will go through.

747
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,238
I know what it means.

748
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,010
My uncle's dead.

749
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,591
There's nothing you could've done.

750
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:57,854
Molly.

751
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:01,566
Molly.

752
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,775
We're gonna find your parents.

753
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,231
The most important thing right now
is keeping you safe.

754
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,625
Thanks.

755
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,460
You shouldn't text while driving.

756
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,137
You're a smart kid.

757
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,387
Only in emergencies.

758
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:35,558
This qualifies.

759
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,027
What did this?

760
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,326
We're not sure.

761
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,078
Bad things are happening.

762
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,556
But good people are gonna make it better.

763
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,628
We're gonna need a lot of good people.

764
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:21,765
I'm gonna close the door.

765
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:44,869
Let me look at your arm again.

766
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,194
I'm gonna do a better job this time.

767
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:03,688
Thanks, Monk.

768
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,140
You got it working, didn't you?

769
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:10,945
You got it working.

770
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:12,863
Something went wrong.

771
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,990
Shepard smashed a Higgs boson,

772
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,622
overloaded.

773
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,831
Somehow you ended up here.

774
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,038
Your dimension crashed into mine.

775
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,138
Crew must be working on power,

776
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,137
trying to fire the Shepard again,
to get you back home.

777
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,228
Could you do me a favor?

778
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,793
Would you mind mentioning to your crew

779
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,601
that your escaping my dimension
will trap me in yours.

780
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:55,150
I've been thinking...

781
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,322
When we put out the fire, we ventilated...

782
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:00,489
What if condensation caused
the Shepard to overload?

783
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,862
Ventilation could fix that.

784
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,457
Run the numbers.

785
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,706
I'll check the circuits.

786
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,246
Tam.

787
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,725
Schmidt.

788
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:20,027
M Deck, I need help in Airlock 6.

789
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:21,358
I can't get out'.

790
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,050
Tam!

791
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:42,596
Hold on!

792
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,319
It's jammed. We gotta try and override it.

793
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,223
Tam, we're gonna get you out!

794
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,186
- Hurry!
- It's not working.

795
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,480
Come on! Come on!

796
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,102
Mundy, let's do it manually.

797
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,376
Pull!

798
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,336
What's happening?

799
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:23,137
Get her out!

800
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,023
Let go!

801
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,759
Tam figured out
what we've been doing wrong.

802
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,012
Condensation has been
throwing off our numbers.

803
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,803
We needed to ventilate.

804
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,154
We can't stay here.

805
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:24,401
This dimension is eating us alive.

806
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,199
We need to fix the Shepard
and use it to get home.

807
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:28,908
We can't.

808
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,744
Not without Tam.

809
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:34,833
Maybe not.

810
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,882
Are you sure about this?

811
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,512
<i>All circuits are busy now, please...</i>

812
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,731
<i>All circuits are busy now.</i>

813
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:12,745
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Joe, anything?

814
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:13,912
<i>Not yet.</i>

815
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,286
<i>But there's no debris.
That's a hopeful sign.</i>

816
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,159
<i>We're looking everywhere.</i>

817
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,245
<i>I promise, we'll figure out
what happened to them.</i>

818
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,749
It's the goddamn paradox, isn't it?

819
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,251
You can't find the station
because it isn't here anymore.

820
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,013
And they did this too?

821
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:30,717
What's happening here?

822
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,451
<i>Michael, I'll call you
as soon as I know anything.</i>

823
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,637
Look, I just need you to write this down.

824
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:40,189
I need you to contact Andrew and
Nancy Pontanius in Philadelphia.

825
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,316
My phone's not going through. So just...

826
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,112
Just tell them their daughter,
Molly, is okay...

827
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,208
- Can you install Tam's algorithm?
- Yes.

828
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,104
- But I want all of Schmidt's work.
- What?

829
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,209
- Done.
- Kiel.

830
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:11,421
Once we get the Shepard operational,
we give her your work,

831
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,598
we put her on an escape pod
and we send her home with the specs.

832
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:15,684
What do you need?

833
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:18,386
Power. Parts of the core
are irreparably damaged.

834
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,971
What's left isn't sufficient to fire.

835
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:21,768
How much?

836
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,586
I'd like 210 kilowatts
for at least eight seconds.

837
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:24,817
Possibly as much as 12.

838
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,623
I'd like to take a bath
with identical twins

839
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,732
in a tub of Rocky Road.

840
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,064
Figure it out. Hamilton,
get Jensen whatever she needs.

841
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:32,038
Let's get this done
and get the hell outta here.

842
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,660
You can change in here.

843
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,750
Thank you.

844
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,244
Nothing of mine would fit you, but...

845
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,333
- try this.
- Thanks.

846
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:56,766
You know, as odd as it is for me
to suddenly have you up here,

847
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,011
I realize it must be much stranger
for you.

848
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,978
Maybe I'm not the same Ava
you're friends with.

849
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:08,860
No, you're the same.

850
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,107
A little sadder, perhaps.
The situation calls for it.

851
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,133
Mina?

852
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,090
Did you know my family?

853
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,597
Of course.

854
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:38,807
Michael, Isaac...

855
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,186
Ayana.

856
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,102
And your friend was...

857
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,396
strong enough to stay?

858
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,195
Stay where?

859
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:51,822
On Earth.

860
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,158
After the fire.

861
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:57,911
What fire?

862
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,374
The power cell.

863
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,251
The one I put in the house,
so they could...

864
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:12,754
have reading lights at night,
so they would feel safe.

865
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:17,514
The fire...

866
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,092
It killed them both.

867
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:39,578
<i>Hi, Mina.</i>

868
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:44,077
<i>A little visitor has come to see you.</i>

869
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,953
<i>Hi, Aunty Mina.</i>

870
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,912
<i>We love you.</i>

871
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,417
<i>Yes, sending love.</i>

872
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:53,716
<i>Why don't you tell Aunty Mina
about your soccer results?</i>

873
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,087
<i>I scored seven goals.</i>

874
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,215
<i>- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.</i>

875
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:58,546
<i>You only scored five.</i>

876
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,882
<i>At the 89th minute I scored.</i>

877
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,022
Ava...

878
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:12,185
In this world your family's alive.

879
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,197
They're on Earth.

880
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:22,111
That's why you didn't come up here.

881
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,038
You're down there...

882
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:27,876
with them.

883
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,722
If I divert everything
non-life supporting from the station,

884
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,892
I can get us up to 170,
maybe 180 kilowatts.

885
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,560
- That's not enough.
- 210, I know.

886
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,013
So, I started thinking about
what life supporting elements

887
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:51,224
we could sacrifice.
Which is when I landed on this.

888
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,025
If I shut down the O2,

889
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:55,937
I can get us up to 240.

890
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,237
Power down the O2 pumps.

891
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:58,696
There are six of us.

892
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,070
That gives us two hours of oxygen,
more or less.

893
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,361
So, we turn off the O2 pumps,
fire the Shepard,

894
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:06,618
then route the power generated
by the now-operational Shepard

895
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,119
and restart the pumps.

896
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,209
That's clever.

897
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:10,294
I'm clever.

898
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,170
Kiel,

899
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,630
I need you for a minute.

900
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,973
Anything you need, I'm here to help.

901
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,300
I won't let you down.

902
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:29,582
We're all dealing with a lot.
We've just gotta keep it together.

903
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:30,606
They're alive.

904
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,267
In this place, my children are alive.

905
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,278
I'll do everything you need,
comply with every order,

906
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,151
but if we do get the Shepard to fire again

907
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,681
to get back to where we came from...

908
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:44,527
I won't be here.

909
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,159
You wanna take a pod.

910
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,374
With Volkov and Tam gone,
there are enough vehicles for everyone.

911
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:53,077
- Ava.
- This goes against regulation,

912
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,834
I know, but I don't care.
I need to go to see them.

913
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,004
What about Michael?

914
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,549
And Jensen said you weren't
on the crew of her mission.

915
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,719
- That means you're down there too.
- I know.

916
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:05,138
Ava, that's not your family
down there, that's hers.

917
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,140
What's gonna happen when you get there?

918
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:11,854
You will never understand
what this is like.

919
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,940
No, I won't.

920
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,650
But, as much as you wanna see them,

921
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,353
- this isn't right.
- This isn't just about me.

922
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:23,448
The Ava that's down there wants
the same thing I do. I know her.

923
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:27,365
She'll steal energy for her family,
just like I did.

924
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:29,071
And they won't survive.

925
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,698
I don't just need to see them...

926
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:34,535
I need to save them.

927
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,376
Michael would want me to.

928
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:44,513
Okay.

929
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,739
- If we close...
- Let's turn off the oxygen.

930
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:55,834
The pumps will need to be deactivated

931
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,258
- from the maintenance ring.
- Yeah.

932
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:00,151
That means we'll be working
inside a giant oxygen tank.

933
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:01,854
- One spark, and...
- Kaboom!

934
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,482
Yeah, no, I get it. Kentucky fried Mundy.

935
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:05,406
That's not funny.

936
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,359
I'll be on my comms through 27.

937
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:09,536
Yeah.

938
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:15,836
It's gonna be tight.

939
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,198
Let's have a look at some
of the problems we might come into.

940
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:22,792
Listen, Kiel...

941
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,010
Trust me.

942
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,008
Even with one stumpy arm,
I think I can get this done.

943
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,665
All right, Mundy, what's your progress?

944
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,952
Shutting down the auxiliary O2 pumps
in maintenance room three.

945
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:01,004
<i>I can't understand anything you just said.</i>

946
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,207
I'm nearly ready to transfer the oxygen.

947
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,178
Okay. We're good.

948
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,260
Standing by on X-Deck.

949
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,351
Ready on M.

950
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:14,552
All right, Mundy.

951
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,108
Okay.

952
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,604
<i>The oxygen's pouring in.</i>

953
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,272
<i>I can feel it.</i>

954
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:24,986
Where's the power, Jensen?

955
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,281
Test the actuator.

956
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,786
Mundy, good work.

957
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:44,757
I gotta say,
the pure oxygen in here is sweet.

958
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:47,719
Guys!

959
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:49,179
No.

960
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:50,639
Guys!

961
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:53,892
Mundy?

962
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:02,940
Guys,

963
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,639
you having any magnetic issues...

964
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,030
Mundy.

965
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:16,957
<i>Mundy?</i>

966
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:34,975
<i>Help!</i>

967
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,185
What the hell?

968
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:38,812
Mundy!

969
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:41,147
<i>Guys!</i>

970
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,861
Mina? No!

971
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:56,955
My God.

972
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,947
The Maintenance deck gets more
unstable with every rotation.

973
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,353
It's only a matter of time before
that thing rips the station apart.

974
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:54,215
The ring's spinning off axis
by 17 degrees.

975
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:58,515
Anything more than 25...

976
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:02,062
it won't hold.

977
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,563
We'll all be in pieces.

978
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,854
So we decouple the maintenance ring.

979
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,397
If we're going to survive...

980
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,364
we have to.

981
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,698
Not you, not Jensen.

982
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:17,450
To do that job in the time we have...

983
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:21,856
it will have to be the three of us.

984
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,333
I want to give you some comforting advice,

985
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:32,583
but I have no idea how this is gonna go.

986
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:35,919
Gravity will be unpredictable,
so be sharp.

987
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,430
Follow my lead.

988
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:42,843
The Schmidt that betrayed you,

989
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:45,892
you realize he's not me, right?

990
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,031
Oh, my God.

991
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,638
This isn't gonna hold much longer.

992
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,143
Let's get across.

993
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:29,974
Monk, get moving.

994
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,240
The ring's at 20.2 degrees.

995
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:55,707
<i>Monk, you're almost there.</i>

996
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:57,629
<i>21.5 degrees.</i>

997
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:00,803
No!

998
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:08,345
Monk, look at me.

999
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,108
Give me your arm.

1000
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,152
22.3.

1001
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,111
Hamilton, you need to hurry.

1002
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,377
<i>23. 1 degrees.</i>

1003
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,088
23.4 degrees. Keep moving.

1004
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:44,389
<i>I'm clearing the debris.</i>

1005
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:11,992
It's jammed.

1006
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,377
23.9 degrees.
We have to jettison that ring.

1007
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,356
What is it?

1008
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,152
Kiel?

1009
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,344
We have to shut down the hydraulics.

1010
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:44,117
Let's go.

1011
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,567
<i>24.2 degrees.</i>

1012
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:49,558
Wait. Kiel, what are you doing?

1013
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:52,040
To decouple the ring,
this portal has to be locked.

1014
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,229
Wait, no. Kiel, we can do this remotely...

1015
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,540
I'm the commander of this station.
I have to do this.

1016
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,840
You can get this station home.
You can do it.

1017
01:18:02,303 --> 01:18:03,339
There is no other way.

1018
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,346
You have to.

1019
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,017
It's okay.

1020
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:13,637
Jesus. The ring's at 24.8 degrees.

1021
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:26,407
Oh, God.

1022
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:33,824
<i>24.9 degrees.</i>

1023
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,640
<i>So, Emma just called for a review at six.</i>

1024
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:34,968
<i>- How late?
- Super late.</i>

1025
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,929
<i>- Isaac with Jenny?
- Yeah. I'm getting him at three.</i>

1026
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,060
<i>Thank you. Don't forget his antibiotics.</i>

1027
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:41,816
<i>Yes, no, I won't.</i>

1028
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,814
<i>Yes, you won't. No, you won't.</i>

1029
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,645
<i>- No, I won't forget.
- Okay.</i>

1030
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:48,104
<i>You have something in your hair.</i>

1031
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,315
<i>Where?</i>

1032
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:50,321
<i>- There?
- No.</i>

1033
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,118
<i>- Did I get it?
- No, no, other side.</i>

1034
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:54,641
<i>- Good?
- It's over there now.</i>

1035
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:55,809
<i>- Did I get it?
- You keep missing it.</i>

1036
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,477
<i>- Where is it?
- How do you keep missing it?</i>

1037
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,354
<i>- Oh, my God. What is it?
- It's gone. You're good.</i>

1038
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,273
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah. You got it a few seconds ago.</i>

1039
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:02,297
<i>I was just being stupid.</i>

1040
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:29,115
Hey, beautiful.

1041
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:33,047
Just in case I don't make it
through this...

1042
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,573
What I wanted to say
the last time we spoke was...

1043
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:41,336
maybe we'll try again.

1044
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:47,587
I can't defend the idea now.

1045
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:54,301
There's no time to think about
what we could've done

1046
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:56,345
or what we'll do one day.

1047
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:02,896
The only choice we have

1048
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,585
is to save the people that we still can.

1049
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:08,946
What's our oxygen level?

1050
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,564
We've got 43 good minutes left.

1051
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,224
We'll prep the Shepard to fire twice.

1052
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:17,453
Once to overload,
which should get us home.

1053
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,656
Then again, with Tam's equation
programmed in,

1054
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,350
which should give us the energy we need.

1055
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:24,457
Jensen, copy all of our data
from the Shepard and take it home.

1056
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:26,522
This should eventually help your planet.

1057
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,044
Schmidt, get the Shepard
to countdown mode.

1058
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:31,509
Here's Kiel's firing key.

1059
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:34,845
Jensen and I will take pod three
down before you fire the Shepard

1060
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:36,677
and hopefully get home.

1061
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,018
Okay.

1062
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,270
Okay.

1063
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:23,432
Ava.

1064
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:55,761
Shit.

1065
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:56,929
Jensen.

1066
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,200
No.

1067
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:34,791
We all set on X-Deck?

1068
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:42,808
What are you doing?

1069
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:44,926
I need the firing keys.

1070
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,096
I can't let you take the Shepard.

1071
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:52,318
I can't do that.

1072
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:54,944
It's not a request, Monk.

1073
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:56,614
Please.

1074
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:57,949
Jensen.

1075
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:04,539
I'm sorry.

1076
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,156
But I need that key.

1077
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:24,517
No.

1078
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:25,768
Monk.

1079
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:27,520
Okay.

1080
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,977
I won't let you take the Shepard
away from my world, Schmidt.

1081
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,328
Jensen.

1082
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:47,781
- Please.
- Why've you come back?

1083
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,251
You could've gone home.

1084
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:52,336
We were a crew.

1085
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:53,620
We were never a crew.

1086
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:54,774
Stay away from her, Hamilton.

1087
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,165
This had to happen from the moment
you wiped my crew,

1088
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:58,875
my station, from existence.

1089
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:00,136
No.

1090
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,669
You can't have it both ways, Ava.

1091
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,714
Your family here but the Shepard there.

1092
01:25:04,808 --> 01:25:06,015
You had everything you needed.

1093
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,138
We couldn't rebuild the Shepard
fast enough. Think.

1094
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:10,227
People are dying down there every day.

1095
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:11,764
So, you're just gonna kill us?

1096
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:14,645
If you're asking me if I'm willing
to kill three people

1097
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:17,606
to save eight billion...

1098
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:22,325
Wouldn't you?

1099
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:30,958
Go!

1100
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:32,543
Go!

1101
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:29,809
Ava.

1102
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:32,268
Don't fail them again.

1103
01:26:34,981 --> 01:26:36,813
That is your family down there.

1104
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:47,404
The same kids.

1105
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:50,615
The same man you married.

1106
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:01,835
<i>Love you.</i>

1107
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:03,165
<i>- Love you.
- Yes, sending love.</i>

1108
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:05,238
<i>Why don't you tell Aunty Mina about...</i>

1109
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:07,299
You don't know how bad it is down there.

1110
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:12,683
It'll only get worse.

1111
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,980
Listen to their voices, Ava.

1112
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:30,327
They need you.

1113
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:44,006
You may be willing to kill
your children again.

1114
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:53,011
But, I won't let those people
down there die.

1115
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:37,135
<i>Yes, I did. I learned my back handspring.</i>

1116
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:38,813
<i>And...</i>

1117
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:54,662
Ava.

1118
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:57,373
Ava.

1119
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:24,774
<i>I don't know. Found an extra tickle.</i>

1120
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:52,423
<i>I don't know where to start.</i>

1121
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:00,764
<i>But this isn't my world.</i>

1122
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:07,520
<i>As much as I want it to be.</i>

1123
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:10,988
<i>It isn't mine.</i>

1124
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:20,664
<i>It's yours.</i>

1125
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,292
Ava.

1126
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:26,855
You're not losing your mind. I promise.

1127
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:31,662
There's no other way to say this.

1128
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:35,804
I'm you.

1129
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:39,934
I have to be quick.

1130
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,969
Attached to this message
are detailed construction

1131
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:45,350
and operation plans
for the Shepard Accelerator.

1132
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:48,432
I'm praying it helps your planet.

1133
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:50,980
I have the same hope for mine.

1134
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:56,402
I need to say two things

1135
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:58,659
that won't make sense to you.

1136
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:01,078
But, please, hear me.

1137
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:04,581
And understand how important
these both are.

1138
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:08,003
First...

1139
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,293
If you've installed a power cell
at the house,

1140
01:31:13,677 --> 01:31:14,838
take it out.

1141
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:15,928
Now.

1142
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:18,883
It's wrong and it's dangerous.

1143
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:21,887
And if these plans work,
you won't need to siphon power anyway.

1144
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:25,729
And, two...

1145
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:30,061
Whatever you're doing right now,

1146
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:35,276
whatever meeting you're in
or wherever you're going, stop.

1147
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:40,068
Go to your husband and your children

1148
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:42,705
right now.

1149
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:45,958
Go to them.

1150
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:47,835
And hold them.

1151
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:51,958
Hold them for as long as you can.

1152
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,962
Kiss them. And love them.

1153
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:57,884
And know how blessed you are

1154
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,429
to have them in your life.

1155
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:04,059
That's all there is.

1156
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:08,937
That's all there is.

1157
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:36,675
Three...

1158
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,093
two...

1159
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:39,762
one...

1160
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:40,804
mark.

1161
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:20,627
<i>Cloverfield, do you copy?</i>

1162
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,212
Huntsville, this is Hamilton.
Can you hear us?

1163
01:33:23,306 --> 01:33:24,592
<i>Where have you guys been?</i>

1164
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:26,917
That's something of a conversation.

1165
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:29,144
We can explain later.

1166
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:32,097
Listen, I'd rush an emergency team
up here for repairs.

1167
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:34,644
Schmidt and I are all that's left.

1168
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:41,073
Huntsville?

1169
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:43,528
<i>What did you do up there?</i>

1170
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:44,818
<i>What's going with the Shepard?</i>

1171
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:46,829
Stand by.

1172
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:31,162
We have a stable beam.

1173
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,421
The Shepard...

1174
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:42,426
is working.

1175
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:13,914
<i>Michael, we got them.</i>

1176
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:15,996
You did? You found them?

1177
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:18,577
<i>Ava, the station. We made contact.</i>

1178
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:26,130
<i>She can't wait to see you.</i>

1179
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:27,257
<i>She's coming back.</i>

1180
01:35:27,513 --> 01:35:28,993
You're having her come back to Earth?

1181
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:30,784
Do they know what's happening here?

1182
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:31,808
<i>No, there wasn't time.</i>

1183
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:33,310
<i>We lost contact.</i>

1184
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,982
<i>Listen, just get to the Delaware coast.</i>

1185
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:43,356
<i>- She's splashing down at 4:30.</i>
- Have you lost your mind?

1186
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:44,778
<i>The station's been through hell.</i>

1187
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:46,856
You're having her come back
to these things.

1188
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,358
<i>There's nothing we could do.
They couldn't stay up there.</i>

1189
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:55,822
<i>Michael, there wasn't a choice.</i>

1190
01:35:55,875 --> 01:35:57,832
There is a choice.
Tell them not to come back.

1191
01:35:57,919 --> 01:36:00,627
<i>- Listen to me. You have to listen...</i>
- Tell them not to come back.

1192
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:02,375
Tell them not to come back!

1193
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:05,128
Do you hear me?
Tell them not to come back!

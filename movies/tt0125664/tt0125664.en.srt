00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:46,531
Hello.

3
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:49,864
I am Andy.

4
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:54,698
And I would like to thank you
for coming to my movie.

5
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:59,989
I wish it was better, you know.

6
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:04,656
But it is so stupid. It's terrible.

7
00:01:05,073 --> 00:01:06,906
I do not even like it.

8
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,948
All of the most important things
in my life...

9
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,823
...are changed around and mixed up...

10
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:19,656
...for dramatic purposes.

11
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:22,698
So...

12
00:01:24,198 --> 00:01:28,198
...I decided to cut out all of the baloney.

13
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:34,739
Now, the movie is much shorter.

14
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:43,364
In fact, this is the end of the movie.

15
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,823
Thank you very much.

16
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:00,323
I am not fooling. Good-bye.

17
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:03,406
Go.

18
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,781
Well, you're still here. Okay!

19
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:08,031
I hope you're not upset.

20
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:12,031
I did that to get rid of those folks
who just wouldn't understand me.

21
00:04:12,156 --> 00:04:14,281
And don't even want to try!

22
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:17,698
Actually, the movie is really great.

23
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,031
It's just filled with colorful characters,
like the one I just did...

24
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:24,614
...and the one I'm doing now.

25
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,573
Our story begins...

26
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:33,114
...back in Great Neck, Long Island.

27
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:39,114
<i>This is our house.</i>

28
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:41,948
<i>And that's my father's old car.</i>

29
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,948
<i>That's my father.</i>

30
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:46,198
<i>That's my little brother, Michael.</i>

31
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:48,573
<i>That's my little sister, Carol.</i>

32
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:49,781
<i>And that's my mom.</i>

33
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:53,281
Janice, Andy's up in his room?

34
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:55,489
Yeah.

35
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:04,698
Mr. Bear is saying that Mrs. Cat
made his head fall off.

36
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:08,573
Mrs. Bear is saying, she saw it,
and it's not true.

37
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:12,781
Today's special guest, Mr. Bear.
What's up, Mr. Bear?

38
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:14,031
Andy?

39
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:23,823
Son, this has got to stop.

40
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:28,823
Our house is not a television station.
There's not a camera in that wall.

41
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:33,364
I mean, this is not healthy.
You should be outside, playing sports.

42
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:35,489
But I have my own sports show.

43
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:39,864
Andy, you know that's not what I meant.
I'm gonna put my foot down.

44
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:41,698
No more playing alone.

45
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:44,448
You want to perform,
you have got to have an audience.

46
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:45,698
They're right there!

47
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:48,489
That is not an audience. That is plaster.

48
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:53,114
An audience is made of people.
People who live and breathe.

49
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:07,698
<i>Andy Kaufman and Howdy Doody present,
The Animal Song!</i>

50
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:12,489
Now, I'm gonna say the animal,
and then you tell me what it says, okay?

51
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,031
Okay.

52
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:17,531

<i>The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

70
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,989
So, Mr. Besserman,
same spot tomorrow?

71
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:08,448
I don't know, Andy.
I think I have to let you go.

72
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:13,656
You're firing me?

73
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:17,198
You don't even pay me.

74
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:21,198
<i>I don't want to seem insulting,
but your act is like Amateur Hour.</i>

75
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:25,739
You're doing sing-alongs for 6-year-olds,
puppets that aren't funny, playing records.

76
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:29,531
But it's totally original.
I mean, no one's ever done it.

77
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:31,114
I'm not like everyone else.

78
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,781
Everybody else gets this place cooking.

79
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:37,156
It was cooking. There was a man
over here that was really upset.

80
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:40,489
He stormed out, and many people left
in the middle of your act.

81
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:42,698
I can't sell booze to people walking out.

82
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:44,864
It's just about booze, not comedy or art.

83
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:47,656
<i>I can't sell booze when you sing,
Pop Goes the Weasel.</i>

84
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:48,864
Booze is all that matters.

85
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:51,448
I'm running a business here.
It's show business.

86
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:53,364
Show. Business.

87
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:57,364
Show. Business.
Without the "business" there's no "show".

88
00:07:57,698 --> 00:07:59,281
And there's no show for you.

89
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:02,073
What do you want me to do?
"Take my wife, please!"

90
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,948
Well, at least it's a joke. Try some jokes.

91
00:08:05,073 --> 00:08:07,948
Like: Why did the Siamese twins
go to England?

92
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,739
I don't know. Why did they go to England?

93
00:08:10,864 --> 00:08:13,114
So the other one could drive.

94
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:20,239
Why doesn't the other one
just learn how to drive?

95
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:23,989
Maybe that one isn't for you,
but do jokes about the traffic.

96
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:26,948
Do impressions.
Maybe some blue material.

97
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:59,406
<i>Thank you very much. Good night!</i>

98
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,739
IMPROVISATION

99
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:27,364
Now?

100
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:31,239
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

101
00:09:35,364 --> 00:09:39,573
<i>One thing I do not like is too much traffic.</i>

102
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:42,239
<i>You know?</i>

103
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:48,906
<i>Tonight I had to come from...</i>

104
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:58,281
<i>And the freeway, it was so much traffic.</i>

105
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:03,531
<i>It took me an hour and a half to get here.</i>

106
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:11,198
<i>But, talking about the terrible things...</i>

107
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:17,573
<i>My wife, take my wife. Please take her!</i>

108
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:21,281
<i>No.</i>

109
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,573
<i>I'm only kidding.</i>

110
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:35,073
<i>I love my wife.
But she don't know how to cook.</i>

111
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:38,948
<i>Her cooking is so bad. It's terrible.</i>

112
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:45,781
<i>Now, I would like to do for you...</i>

113
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:48,448
<i>... the imitations.</i>

114
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:54,031
<i>I would like to start with Jimmy Carter.</i>

115
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,698
<i>The President of the United States.</i>

116
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:05,531
<i>Hello. I am Jimmy Carter...</i>

117
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:09,073
<i>... the President of the United States.</i>

118
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:18,614
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

119
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:26,364
<i>Now, I would like to do for you...</i>

120
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,989
<i>... the Elvis Presley.</i>

121

126
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:09,198
Budd, what's the story with this guy?

127
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,239
I think he's from Lithuania.

00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:09,198
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.

136
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:13,364
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
I really liked what you did out there.

137
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:15,281
Thank you very much.

138
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:20,323
So, I understand you're from Lithuania.

139
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:23,864
No. I am from Caspiar.

140
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,656
Caspiar, huh?

141
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:31,448
It is a very small island in the Caspian Sea.

142
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:33,989
It sunk.

143
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:37,448
I'm sorry.

144
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:41,406
Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind...

145
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:45,948
...but I think you're very interesting,
and if you ever need representation...

146
00:14:46,073 --> 00:14:47,573
...we should talk.

147
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:48,614
Okay.

148
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:53,073
"George Shapiro".

149
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:54,823
Mr. Shapiro!

150
00:14:58,406 --> 00:14:59,989
It is an honor, sir.

151
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:02,073
Caspiar, huh?

152
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,073
I want to be the biggest star in the world.

153
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,573
People love comedians.

154
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:12,031
I'm not a comedian. I don't do jokes.
I don't know what's funny.

155
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:14,239
I'm a song-and-dance man.

156
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:15,448
Yeah.

157
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:16,906
Thank you.

158
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:19,823
I particularly suggest the lotus root.

159
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:37,489
You show a lot of promise,
and my concern is...

160
00:15:37,656 --> 00:15:40,989
...I don't know where to book you.
You're not a standup...

161
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:46,573
...and your act doesn't exactly
translate itself to film, so...

162
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:56,614
So, help me. Where do you see yourself?

163
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:01,156
I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.

164
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:04,031
That's funny.

165
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:10,948
See, I don't want to go for cheap laughs.

166
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,864
I want real gut reactions.
I want the audience...

167
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,614
...to have gone through an experience.

168
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:18,448
They love me, they hate me, they walk out.

169
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:20,114
It's all great!

170
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:22,489
Andy, you got a little something.

171
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:33,198
When I'm famous, I'm gonna sell these.
"As worn by Andy Kaufman".

172
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:37,281
You can have this one.
It's probably gonna be worth a lot...

173
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:39,948
...'cause it was actually up my nose.

174
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:43,031
You're insane!

175
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,781
But you might also be brilliant.

<i>He is a psychopath!</i>

190
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:28,114
Now, slowly open your eyes.

191
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:34,239
You should feel rested, relaxed and alert.

192
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:39,573
I would like to thank you, Your Holiness.

193

195

I'm sorry.

196

I have a question.

197
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:02,031
Is there a secret to being funny?

198
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:06,406
Yes.

Hi.

223
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,906
- Right this way, please.
- Okay.

224
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,823
George is expecting you.

225
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:33,406
Andy.

226
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,198
Thanks for coming out.

227
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,406
- Thank you, George.
- Come on, sit down.

228
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:43,614
- Which one?
- Either one.

229
00:20:43,698 --> 00:20:45,114
They're both red.

230
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:48,448
This one, I guess.

231
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:50,323
So, did you have a nice flight?

232
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,573
I did. I had a really good flight.

233
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:55,406
And the stewardess was very nice...

234
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:57,906
...and she allowed me
to keep my headphones.

235
00:20:58,531 --> 00:20:59,823
That's terrific!

236
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:00,948
Yeah!

237
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:02,781
Andy.

238
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:05,114
I got something better.

239
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,656
- You do?
- Yeah.

240
00:21:07,114 --> 00:21:08,281
This is big.

241
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:09,864
Okay.

242
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:11,781
Okay?

243
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:12,531
Okay.

244
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:17,323
You are getting a once-in-a-lifetime,
very lucrative opportunity...

245
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:21,781
...to star on a prime time network sitcom!

246
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:28,573
A sitcom?

247
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:32,198
Yeah! And this is a class act.

248
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:35,614
It all takes place in a taxi stand.

249
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:38,198
And you're gonna be the Fonzie.

250
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:42,781
Fonzie?

251
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:44,448
No.

252
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:50,073
The Fonzie. The crazy breakout character
who all the kids imitate...

253
00:21:50,198 --> 00:21:52,573
...and they put them on the lunch boxes.

254
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:55,489
I hate sitcoms, George.
I've never liked them.

255
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:58,489
These guys have seen
your foreign-man character.

256
00:21:59,114 --> 00:22:01,906
And they want to turn him into...

257
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:05,948
...a lovable, goofy mechanic named...

258
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:12,948
...Latka.

259
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:20,531
No.

260
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:21,823
- No?
- No.

261
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:23,114
No to which part?

262
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:26,198
No to the whole thing.
It doesn't sound good to me.

263
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,614
Andy, this is every comedian's dream!

264
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,073
I'm not a comedian, George.

265
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:34,531
And sitcoms are the lowest form
of entertainment.

266
00:22:34,823 --> 00:22:39,406
I mean, it's just stupid jokes
and canned laughter!

267
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:42,114
And you don't know why it's there,
but it's there.

268
00:22:42,198 --> 00:22:45,698
It's dead people laughing, did you
know that? Those people are dead!

269
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,573
Andy, this is classy.

270
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:49,323
I don't care.

271
00:22:50,198 --> 00:22:53,739
I want to generate my own material.

272
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,989
Look, listen. Listen to me.

273
00:22:58,114 --> 00:23:00,614
I've been in this business
for 20 years, Andy!

274
00:23:00,739 --> 00:23:03,281
I know, I've seen this! I know this!

275
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:07,031
If you pass up this opportunity,
you will never...

276
00:23:07,948 --> 00:23:10,406
...never see another one like it again.

277
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:12,406
Never!

278
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:25,073
Okay.

279
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,364
I'll do it.

280
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,906
But I have some terms.

281
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:32,948
Sure. That's what negotiations
are all about.

282
00:23:36,823 --> 00:23:38,156
What are you doing?

283
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:40,323
I'm writing out my terms.

284
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:53,406
Are you making fun of me?

285
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:54,614
Those are my terms.

286
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:56,239
This is ridiculous, Andy!

287
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,489
It's what I need to do the show.

288
00:23:58,698 --> 00:23:59,989

"Four guaranteed guest spots

Who's Tony Clifton?

291
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:06,864
He's a Vegas lounge singer.

292
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:11,073
I used to do impressions of him,
and we kinda got into a fight over it.

293
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:12,531
This Clifton called me!

294
00:24:12,656 --> 00:24:13,239
He did?

295
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:15,531
He's a loon! He hates you!

296
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:18,906
No. He just talks tough. But I owe him.

Just a little friendly conversation, George.

370
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:18,948

I don't understand this act.

373
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:37,239
It's good, old-fashioned entertainment.
Everyone loves a villain.

374
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:39,573
What about that poor schlep
you humiliated?

375
00:29:39,698 --> 00:29:41,489
Hey, man, excellent show.

376
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,281
- That was a great show.
- Yeah, good show for you.

377
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:48,156
George, this is my writer and old friend,
Bob Zmuda.

378
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:50,989
- How are you? I'm Bob.
- He's very creative.

379
00:29:51,114 --> 00:29:54,989
- Yes, I'm the brains behind this operation.
- Yeah, dream on.

380
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:59,239
He once faked a lion escaping
from the Chicago Zoo.

381
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:01,281
This was fantastic, George.

382
00:30:01,406 --> 00:30:04,239
We got like 40 actors and they're tearin'
through the zoo.

383
00:30:04,364 --> 00:30:06,281
They shut the place down for two days.

384
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:09,073
They're screamin', "There's a fuckin' lion!"

385
00:30:10,531 --> 00:30:12,489
Your name's not Gorsky.

386
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:16,698
Don't believe everything you hear, George.

387
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:18,656
This cannot leave this room.

388
00:30:19,073 --> 00:30:20,698
Do not write this down.

389
00:30:20,823 --> 00:30:21,823
Okay?

390
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:24,739
Tony Clifton is Andy Kaufman.

391
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:28,864
And Andy Kaufman is Tony Clifton.

392
00:30:29,114 --> 00:30:32,239
They'll deny it up and down,
but believe me, it's true.

393
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:35,573
This is great business.

394
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:38,864
You get two Andy Kaufmans
for the price of one.

395
00:30:44,114 --> 00:30:45,198
Andy!

396
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:46,989
- Andy.
- What's up?

397
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:48,531
They said, "Yes".

398
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:51,406
You're gettin' everything. Everything!

399
00:30:54,531 --> 00:30:56,614
- Bonus. Bonus!
- Whatever you want.

400
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:59,489
- Thank you very much.
- It was so good.

401
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:02,823
<i>- I have to do Taxi, don't I?
- You gotta do Taxi.</i>

402
00:31:20,823 --> 00:31:22,739
Party time for Latka.

403
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:25,156
Not until you take off those overalls.

404
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:26,781
This is a good party.

405
00:31:28,323 --> 00:31:31,073
No! Latka, listen to me. Listen to me.

406
00:31:31,198 --> 00:31:33,489
There's a drug in those cookies.

407
00:31:34,531 --> 00:31:35,531
No?

408
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:37,406
- Yeah.
- No.

409
00:31:38,156 --> 00:31:39,156
No!

410
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:47,739
Bed?

411
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:53,031
I have never been so emotional
in all my life!

412
00:31:53,323 --> 00:31:56,448
And this is for my mother!
And this is for my father!

413
00:31:56,573 --> 00:31:58,656
And this is for my grandfather!

414
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:03,073
I hope you have a small family.

415
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:20,781
Thank you very much.

416
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:32,698
- I'm gonna quit.
- What?

417
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:34,823
Every show is worse than the last one.

418
00:32:34,948 --> 00:32:38,114
Forty million people are watching your ass
every week, Kaufman.

419
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:39,406
What do they know?

420
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:41,948
Absolutely nothing! And that's the beauty.

421
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:44,198
Man, look, it's credibility.

422
00:32:44,323 --> 00:32:48,073
You make them love you now,
and then later on, on your special...

423
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:51,573
...you can fuck with their heads.
The sky is the limit, man!

424
00:32:56,531 --> 00:32:58,281
Oh, yeah? I don't care!

425
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:02,823
Sir, there's a problem
down on the Kaufman special.

426
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:05,864
They say he's not following
the technical requirements.

427
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:07,073
Technical?

428
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:09,323
<i>Thanks for coming on my show.</i>

429
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:11,364
<i>Thanks for having me on your show.</i>

430
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,906
- Okay. Right now. Roll it!
- No.

431
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:15,739
It's my special!

432
00:33:16,031 --> 00:33:18,364
I have creative control. Now, roll it!

433
00:33:18,573 --> 00:33:19,448
No!

434
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:21,323
- Do it, man!
- Andy!

435
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:25,948
Be careful, please! Only positive energy
allowed behind this point.

436
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:29,489
I've been hearing fabulous things
about the special.

437
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:32,864
What? Did we hit a little speed bump?

438
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:35,156
And his name is Colin.

439
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:38,364
Kid Genius told me to mess
with the vertical hold.

440
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:39,948
Show me. Show me.

441
00:33:40,364 --> 00:33:41,823
Show him, Colin.

442
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:49,281
<i>Thanks for having me on your show, Andy.
Boy, it's sure...</i>

443
00:33:56,698 --> 00:33:58,198
It'll be great!

444
00:33:58,323 --> 00:34:00,489
People will think their TV is broken!

445
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:03,114
They'll get outta their chairs,
walk over to the TV...

446
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:07,614
...twist the knobs, call the TV store:
"Hey, I paid a lot of money for that TV!"

447
00:34:07,739 --> 00:34:11,406
They'll bang on the television
and they won't be able to fix it!

448
00:34:16,073 --> 00:34:19,364
Andy, we don't want the viewers
to get out of their chairs.

449
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,948
But it's funny!

450
00:34:22,614 --> 00:34:24,656
It's a practical joke.

451
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:29,323
The viewer must be able
to see the program.

452
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:35,823
But, it's only gonna be for 30 seconds.

453
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:37,031
Five.

454
00:34:38,156 --> 00:34:39,114
Twenty.

455
00:34:39,573 --> 00:34:40,448
Ten.

456
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:42,323
Deal.

457
00:34:45,031 --> 00:34:46,656
Okay Andy, ten seconds, huh?

458
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:48,489
Ten seconds, okay.

459
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,656
- Ten seconds is all I really wanted.
- Ten seconds is perfect.

460
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:07,739
<i>I've been watching you
since I was a little boy, Howdy.</i>

461
00:35:07,864 --> 00:35:10,573
<i>I didn't even know what TV was,
but I was watching you.</i>

462

463
00:35:11,573 --> 00:35:13,573
<i>You're the first friend in TV
I've ever had.</i>

464
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:14,698
That is so moving.

465
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,614
<i>You're as real as anyone else
in the show to me.</i>

466
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:19,531
<i>And I love you.</i>

467
00:35:19,656 --> 00:35:20,573
<i>I really do.</i>

468
00:35:20,698 --> 00:35:22,406
This is not funny.

469
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:25,239
This is artsy-fartsy shit.

470
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:27,823
This is the magical part of the show.

471
00:35:27,948 --> 00:35:31,739
The show's not all like this.
It's hysterical! Lt gets very funny.

472
00:35:31,948 --> 00:35:35,614
Christ! We're the Number 1 network.
Can't we afford a decent TV?

473
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:38,614
No, that's part of the show.

474
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:40,948
This is part of the show?

475
00:35:41,073 --> 00:35:41,614
Yes.

476
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,406
What do you mean, part of the show?

477
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:45,698
That's the way Andy wants it,
with the roll.

478
00:35:45,823 --> 00:35:48,698
<i>Thanks, Andy. I love you, too.</i>

479
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,781
Tell Kaufman this network
will never air this program.

480
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,073
Hey, that's Andy Kaufman.

481
00:36:00,323 --> 00:36:01,614
You wanna bet?

482
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:07,156
Excuse me. Are you Andy Kaufman?

483
00:36:09,573 --> 00:36:11,573
I get that all the time.

484
00:36:21,698 --> 00:36:24,573
This is ridiculous. Take off that apron.

485
00:36:27,448 --> 00:36:28,448
No.

486
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:31,031
I'd rather work here than at ABC.

487
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:33,406
I'm sorry. They're a bunch of assholes.

488
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:35,573
Look, we work in a creative business.

489
00:36:35,656 --> 00:36:38,448
There's no telling
what people are gonna like or dislike.

490
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,698
<i>The only reason why I did Taxi...</i>

491
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:43,781
...was that I could have my own special.

492
00:36:43,906 --> 00:36:48,031
I know. Well, I'll tell you what.
Let me book you some colleges now.

493
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:50,073
And then, I'll take the special around.

494
00:36:50,198 --> 00:36:53,739
I'll show it to people
and see if anybody wants to buy it.

495
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:56,656
We'll have a garage sale.
No, I'm over and out.

496
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,781
- You know, you're not over and out.
- Yeah, I am over and out.

497
00:36:59,906 --> 00:37:01,948
- You can't be.
- I'll show you over and out.

498
00:37:02,073 --> 00:37:04,656
You've got a deal with ABC.
You've gotta honor it.

499
00:37:04,781 --> 00:37:07,698
All right. How much longer
is left on my contract?

500
00:37:07,823 --> 00:37:12,364
Well, you signed for five years, so,
four years and seven months.

501
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:40,739
<i>Thank you. It's really great to be here.</i>

502
00:37:41,031 --> 00:37:44,448
<i>We're gonna have a great show tonight.
A really good one!</i>

503
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,906
<i>We're gonna start by singing
some songs and...</i>

504
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:51,406
Do Latka!

505
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:53,281
<i>- Yeah, Latka!
- What?</i>

506
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:56,156
<i>Wait!</i>

507
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,864
<i>Excuse me for one second.</i>

508
00:38:08,073 --> 00:38:09,281
- I saw that.
- What?

509
00:38:09,364 --> 00:38:12,281
- Gimme the book.
- No, I'm not going to give you the book.

510
00:38:12,406 --> 00:38:13,114
Is something wrong?

511
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,739
No, everything's okay. Fine.

512
00:38:14,864 --> 00:38:16,406
Hey, can I squeeze your nuts?

513
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:17,739
Thanks.

514
00:38:18,198 --> 00:38:20,114
They're asking for it.

515
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:33,281
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
since you're such a special audience...</i>

516
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:35,823
<i>Yeah!</i>

517
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:41,448
<i>I am going to reveal,
for the very first time, ever, the real me.</i>

518
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:44,406
<i>That's right.</i>

519
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:51,656
<i>I'm actually British.</i>

520
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:57,448
<i>And though I dabble in clowning,
I do find it so boorish...</i>

521
00:38:58,198 --> 00:38:59,406
<i>... so American.</i>

522
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:01,906
<i>I prefer the fine arts.</i>

523
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:05,573
<i>Henceforth, today,
I am going to grace you with a reading...</i>

524
00:39:06,156 --> 00:39:08,573
<i>... of one of the greatest novels
ever written.</i>

525
00:39:08,698 --> 00:39:11,198
<i>The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.</i>

526
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:17,489
<i>Please.</i>

527
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:21,698
<i>"In my younger
and more vulnerable years...</i>

528
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:23,156
<i>"... my father gave me some advice...</i>

529
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:25,823
<i>"... that I've been turning over
in my mind ever since.</i>

530
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:28,656
<i>"'Whenever you feel like
criticizing anyone, ' he told me...</i>

531
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:31,156
<i>"'... just remember
that all the people of this world...</i>

532
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:32,989
<i>"'... haven't had the advantages
that you've had. '</i>

533

communicative, in a reserved way.</i>

a great deal, more than that. "</i>

535
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:51,198
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

536
00:39:56,864 --> 00:40:00,489
<i>"In consequence, I'm inclined
to reserve all judgments.</i>

537
00:40:00,614 --> 00:40:03,406
<i>"A habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me...</i>

538
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:06,948
<i>"... and also made me the victim
of not a few veteran bones. "</i>

539
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:07,989
Oh, come on!

540
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:12,489
<i>No. Please keep it down.
We've got a long way to go.</i>

541
00:40:13,531 --> 00:40:16,781
<i>"They were the same people,
or at least the same sort of people...</i>

542
00:40:16,906 --> 00:40:18,739
<i>"... the same profusion of cham... "</i>

543
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:21,948
<i>I tell you what.
Would you rather I kept reading...</i>

544
00:40:22,156 --> 00:40:24,698
<i>... or do you prefer to hear
the phonograph record?</i>

545
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:25,989
Record!

546
00:40:26,114 --> 00:40:27,406
<i>I'm sorry, I can't hear you.</i>

547
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:28,864
Record!

548
00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:30,781
<i>Are you positive?</i>

549
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:33,489
<i>Very well then.</i>

550
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:35,031
Yeah, Mighty Mouse!

551
00:40:40,948 --> 00:40:44,948
<i>"Perhaps his presence gave the evening
its peculiar quality of oppressiveness.</i>

552
00:40:45,073 --> 00:40:49,448
<i>"It stands out in my memory
from Gatsby's other parties that summer.</i>

00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:30,364
All right!

564
00:41:53,448 --> 00:41:55,448
You wanna play Arizona State?

565
00:41:55,573 --> 00:41:58,781
You give them Mighty Mouse.
You give them Elvis.

566
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:01,364
<i>I gave them, The Great Gatsby.</i>

567
00:42:01,573 --> 00:42:03,489
F. Scott Fitzgerald's best work.

568
00:42:03,614 --> 00:42:05,739
- A classic.
- His finest piece of work.

569
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,323
I don't care!

570
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:18,323
Andy. You have to look inside
and ask this question:

571
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:23,698
Who are you trying to entertain?
The audience or yourself?

572
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:27,198
Excuse me.

573
00:42:31,906 --> 00:42:33,698
- Bob.
- What, George?

574
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:37,739
I'm worried about Andy. This is not good.

575
00:42:37,864 --> 00:42:39,948
His stress level is affecting his work!

576
00:42:40,073 --> 00:42:43,073
Calm down now, George.
That's not gonna help anything, okay?

577
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:47,989
<i>Look, Tony Clifton is gonna go
on Taxi next week.</i>

578
00:42:48,573 --> 00:42:53,364
That should let him blow off steam
and relieve the stress. Okay?

579
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:57,239
Bob, Andy needs to relax. This is your job.

580
00:42:57,364 --> 00:43:00,114
You have to take him away from all of this.

581
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,114
Would you, come on?

582
00:43:05,198 --> 00:43:06,489
Come on!

583
00:43:07,323 --> 00:43:08,489
Shit!

584
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,364
Hi, how you doin' today?

585
00:43:10,448 --> 00:43:11,573
Fine. Great.

586
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:13,489
Hello. Nice to meet you.

587
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:16,198
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

588
00:43:16,406 --> 00:43:17,614
Peachy.

589
00:43:30,114 --> 00:43:32,239
What do we do now?

590
00:43:32,573 --> 00:43:33,781
Now, you pick.

591
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:38,739
But what if I hurt somebody's feelings?

592
00:43:39,156 --> 00:43:42,156
For Christ's sake, you're not gonna hurt
anybody's feelings.

593
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:43,989
They're all professionals.

594
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:46,364
Okay.

595
00:43:52,906 --> 00:43:54,739
All right, which one?

596
00:43:56,948 --> 00:43:58,281
I will have both!

597
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:05,948
<i>I will have this Fraulein.</i>

598
00:44:06,614 --> 00:44:10,573
<i>Und the one with the big strudels.
Mach schnell, mach schnell!</i>

599
00:44:12,906 --> 00:44:14,323
Zmuda, I'm gonna kill you.

600
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:16,114
Excellent choice.

601
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:18,614
- Hi.
- Hi.

602
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,031
Are you having a good day?

603
00:44:22,698 --> 00:44:26,948
It's kind of a big day.
It's my buddy's first time with a prostitute.

604
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:30,989
What are you talking about?
Andy comes here almost every weekend.

605
00:44:32,448 --> 00:44:33,781
Who, Andy?

606
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,489
He doesn't always call himself that.

607
00:44:36,698 --> 00:44:39,406
Sometimes he's Tony and he wears a tux.

608
00:45:04,573 --> 00:45:07,989
If I gave you both $300...

609
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:10,031
...would you...

610
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:17,281
...come to Hollywood
and help me destroy a TV show?

611
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:21,073
$500.

612
00:45:28,114 --> 00:45:29,948
What am I, Harry Houdini?

613
00:45:31,448 --> 00:45:34,114
We busted through. Come on, girls.

614
00:45:34,406 --> 00:45:36,614
Welcome to the Follies Bree-gere!

615
00:45:36,739 --> 00:45:38,781
Okay, here's the man, Tony Clifton!

616
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:42,073
- Taxi, laxy, just the factsy, Maxie!
- Hi.

617
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,364
Hey, hotshot. How're you doing?

618
00:45:44,531 --> 00:45:48,281
- Ed Weinberger, Executive.
- Take a hike! Okay, all right?

619
00:45:49,448 --> 00:45:51,114
What are we doing, huh?

620
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:52,698
Here's your script, Tony.

621
00:45:52,823 --> 00:45:54,781
- That's the script I was given?
- Yeah.

622
00:45:54,906 --> 00:45:56,448
- That's the one I have to do?
- Yeah.

623
00:45:56,573 --> 00:45:57,739
Okay, let me see.

624
00:45:57,864 --> 00:46:00,948
Okay. Bullshit, bullshit, my line.

625
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:03,489
Bullshit, bullshit, my line.

626
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:06,948
That's hilarious!

627
00:46:07,156 --> 00:46:11,406
You know, I reviewed that script last night
and I was not satisfied.

628
00:46:11,531 --> 00:46:13,906
- Yeah, well...
- I was not satisfied.

629
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:16,698
- Well, why don't we just...
- Listen, I made some changes.

630
00:46:16,781 --> 00:46:19,781
I stayed up all night
with these sweet ladies right here...

631
00:46:19,906 --> 00:46:21,573
This is Lemonade.

632
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:25,364
- Can we get to work?
- That'll keep you going on a hot day.

633
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:26,948
And this is Melonia.

634
00:46:27,073 --> 00:46:29,614
How's my little produce department?

635
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:35,364
<i>This is the new Taxi theme song.</i>

636
00:46:40,948 --> 00:46:43,989
"We drive a taxi"

637
00:46:56,156 --> 00:46:57,114
George.

638
00:46:58,781 --> 00:47:03,989
I can't afford to blow this whole episode,
so, we have to let him go.

639
00:47:07,489 --> 00:47:09,489
I'm not sure how Andy's gonna take this.

640
00:47:09,614 --> 00:47:12,573
Well, we just have to go down and tell him.

641
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:16,031
But that's Tony down there. It's not Andy.

642
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,614
I don't give a fuck who that is,
I'm gonna fire him.

643
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:23,281
Okay, all right.
But we better warn Andy first.

644
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:27,614
He's up in San Francisco, doing a concert.
I'll call my secretary.

645
00:47:31,364 --> 00:47:33,364
Diane, this is George.

646
00:47:33,573 --> 00:47:36,531
I'm trying to reach Andy
up in San Francisco.

647
00:47:36,656 --> 00:47:37,781
<i>Okay.</i>

648
00:47:38,698 --> 00:47:39,989
<i>I'll patch you through.</i>

649
00:47:40,114 --> 00:47:41,239
I'll wait.

650
00:47:43,406 --> 00:47:44,073
<i>Hello?</i>

651
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:46,948
Andy. I'm gonna put you on the speaker.

652
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,906
<i>- Hello, Andy.
- Hello?</i>

653
00:47:49,031 --> 00:47:51,698
<i>Hi. I'm here with Ed, over at Taxi.</i>

654
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:53,031
<i>- Hi, Ed.
- Hi, Andy.</i>

655
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:54,656
<i>- How are you?
- I'm fine.</i>

656
00:47:54,781 --> 00:47:55,364
<i>Good.</i>

657
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:57,823
Andy, there's been some trouble
with Tony.

658
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:00,364
<i>Oh, no! Did he get hurt?</i>

659
00:48:00,948 --> 00:48:01,448
No.

660
00:48:01,573 --> 00:48:03,698
No, Andy, it's nothing like that, no.

661
00:48:03,823 --> 00:48:06,739
<i>- Did he hurt someone else?
- No, it's not that.</i>

662
00:48:06,864 --> 00:48:10,156
Andy, the reason I'm calling you
like this is...

663
00:48:10,281 --> 00:48:13,114
I have the utmost respect for your artistry.

664
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:16,739
<i>Well, may I say
that I've always appreciated that, Ed.</i>

665
00:48:16,864 --> 00:48:20,031
Thank you. But you see, in this instance...

666
00:48:21,156 --> 00:48:24,531
I have to ask your permission to fire Tony.

667
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:35,948
<i>George, this is gonna kill Tony.
He's waited for this his whole life.</i>

668
00:48:36,073 --> 00:48:37,739
Andy, there'll be other shots.

669
00:48:37,864 --> 00:48:40,823
Yeah, we have to do this.
He's just a terrible actor.

670
00:48:42,073 --> 00:48:45,823
Okay. But please, let him down gently.

671
00:48:46,698 --> 00:48:47,739
Trust us.

672
00:48:47,864 --> 00:48:50,448
Fuck you! I'm not going!

673
00:48:52,906 --> 00:48:54,073
We had a deal.

674
00:48:54,323 --> 00:48:57,573
I know who you talked to.
You must have talked to someone else!

675
00:48:57,698 --> 00:48:59,614
Yeah! I was talking to Andy Kaufman!

676
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:01,989
I don't know no Andy Kaufman!

677
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:03,656
Security, get in here!

678
00:49:03,781 --> 00:49:05,656
He is ruining my life!

679
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:08,406
Security! Get in here!

680
00:49:23,948 --> 00:49:26,239
Do not hurt him! He's a talented man!

681
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:28,573
I don't want any pictures leaving this set!

682
00:49:28,698 --> 00:49:29,989
Hey! Give that back! Hey!

683
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:32,323
Get Zmuda, he's one of them!

684
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:37,614
If you guys ever go to Vegas,
you're not getting in!

685
00:49:38,823 --> 00:49:41,823
Hey, come here! Give me the camera!
Come here! Come on!

686
00:49:41,948 --> 00:49:43,489
Give me the camera!

687
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:46,406
I got $20 says you work for me now!

688
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:48,573
I would like to use the phone!

689
00:49:49,198 --> 00:49:50,364
Not on the lot, sir.

690
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:53,156
How about a bathroom?
I may have shit my pants.

691
00:49:54,864 --> 00:49:56,073
- Drink of water?
- No.

692
00:49:56,198 --> 00:49:57,156
- Aspirin?
- No.

693
00:49:57,281 --> 00:49:59,114
- Moist towelette?
- No.

694
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:03,114
In that case, it has been an honor
and a good-bye!

695
00:50:04,073 --> 00:50:05,489
WHO IS TONY CLIFTON?

696
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:06,781
This is great!

697
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:11,239
This is too much, man.
It makes Tony real, you know?

698
00:50:11,364 --> 00:50:13,656
It gives him three dimensions.

699
00:50:14,406 --> 00:50:16,864
It's good for his career, George.

700
00:50:17,156 --> 00:50:21,239
Oh, really? You want to book Tony Clifton
at Harrah's Tahoe?

701
00:50:21,364 --> 00:50:24,114
Well, I know the college kids
really like Andy Kaufman.

702
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:28,281
No, look Gene, let me be really clear
about this.

703
00:50:28,448 --> 00:50:31,323
<i>If you book Tony,
do not expect to get Andy.</i>

704
00:50:31,614 --> 00:50:35,073
Well, you know what,
I'll take my chances, all right?

705
00:50:37,156 --> 00:50:39,489
All right. Be my guest. Book him.

706
00:50:43,531 --> 00:50:44,698
<i>Shut up!</i>

707
00:50:47,281 --> 00:50:49,948
<i>Shut the hell up! All of ya!</i>

708
00:50:50,364 --> 00:50:52,823
<i>You make one more sound,
I'll come down there...</i>

709
00:50:52,948 --> 00:50:55,156
<i>... and put your friggin' head in the soup!</i>

710
00:50:56,073 --> 00:50:59,364
<i>When I go like this,
it means I expect total silence!</i>

711
00:51:01,198 --> 00:51:03,989
<i>There is an artiste on stage.</i>

712
00:51:18,698 --> 00:51:20,364
<i>That's better.</i>

713
00:51:28,323 --> 00:51:29,989
<i>"Oh, whether I'm right</i>

714
00:51:31,573 --> 00:51:33,406
<i>"Or whether I'm wrong</i>

715
00:51:34,948 --> 00:51:40,739
<i>"Or whether I find a place in this world
or never belong</i>

716
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:44,531
<i>"I've got to be me</i>

717
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:47,989
<i>"I've gotta be me</i>

718
00:51:48,656 --> 00:51:53,656
<i>"Willing to try to do it or die"</i>

719
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:07,406
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

720
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:10,781
<i>Thank you. I do all my own stunts.</i>

721
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:15,239
<i>"I've got to be"</i>

722
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,323
<i>What the hell's goin' on?</i>

723
00:52:25,448 --> 00:52:26,448
<i>Kaufman!</i>

724
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:38,739
<i>Kaufman's fucking up my act!</i>

725
00:52:44,864 --> 00:52:47,448
<i>Where's it say Kaufman's in the act?</i>

726
00:52:53,614 --> 00:52:55,948
<i>May I borrow this for a second?</i>

727
00:53:15,573 --> 00:53:17,364
<i>Now, you are all wet!</i>

728
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:21,656
<i>You look like you could use
a little drink up there!</i>

729
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,489
<i>Now, go on, get outta here!</i>

730
00:53:23,614 --> 00:53:25,864
<i>That's what you get
for crapping up my act!</i>

731
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:26,656
No.

732
00:53:26,781 --> 00:53:29,073
<i>You get out of here, little drummer boy!</i>

733
00:53:29,198 --> 00:53:30,864
Stay! No, wait Andy, come back!

734
00:53:30,989 --> 00:53:33,781
<i>"I've got to be"</i>

735
00:53:36,198 --> 00:53:37,364
Go home!

736
00:53:37,864 --> 00:53:41,406
<i>"Volare"</i>

737
00:53:57,656 --> 00:54:00,948
Jesus Christ. Close the goddamn door.
Close it!

738
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,573
Look at you.

739
00:54:05,614 --> 00:54:06,698
You're so proud.

740
00:54:06,823 --> 00:54:09,614
You're like some stupid kid
who comes home from school:

741
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:11,531
"Look, Dad, I got an F!"

742
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:15,073
But wasn't it funny?

743
00:54:15,448 --> 00:54:18,489
"Yes, it was funny, Andy. It was".

744
00:54:20,114 --> 00:54:25,531
Yes, it was funny for a little while, until
the audience realized that Tony wasn't you.

745
00:54:29,906 --> 00:54:32,864
So, what do you have here?
A big elaborate joke...

746
00:54:33,198 --> 00:54:35,781
...that's only funny to two people
in the universe.

747
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:37,239
You and you.

748
00:54:37,573 --> 00:54:41,073
Sure, George, yeah.
And we happen to think that it's hilarious.

749
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,781
But what's the point?

750
00:54:45,906 --> 00:54:47,781
It's fun, George.

751
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:54,989
How is this gonna make you
the biggest star in the world?

752
00:54:58,448 --> 00:55:02,406
At this point the audience expects me
to completely shock them, all the time.

753
00:55:02,531 --> 00:55:05,948
But short of faking my own death
or setting the theater on fire...

754
00:55:06,073 --> 00:55:07,739
...I don't know what else to do.

755
00:55:07,864 --> 00:55:10,281
'Cause I've always gotta be
one step ahead of them.

756
00:55:13,281 --> 00:55:14,948
It's like ballet.

757
00:55:16,573 --> 00:55:18,239
Did you see that?

758
00:55:19,948 --> 00:55:22,614
<i>Dropped to the canvas when the two
engaged in a real...</i>

759
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:24,114
These guys are brilliant.

760
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:26,823
I want to be a bad guy wrestler
in the worst way.

761
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,323
I hate to break it to you,
but the problem is...

762
00:55:29,448 --> 00:55:31,823
...you don't have the build
or the look for it...

763
00:55:31,948 --> 00:55:34,698
These guys are huge.
They would kick your ass.

764
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:41,573
Maybe I could pick on someone
a little smaller than me.

765
00:55:43,489 --> 00:55:46,239
No, women are superior to men
in many ways.

766
00:55:46,906 --> 00:55:48,614
MERV!

767
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:51,489
That's right, when it comes
to cooking and cleaning...

768
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:54,531
...and washing the potatoes,
scrubbing the carrots...

769
00:55:54,698 --> 00:55:59,239
...making the babies, mopping the floors.
They have it all over men.

770
00:55:59,364 --> 00:56:02,614
I believe that.
But when it comes to wrestling...

771
00:56:02,781 --> 00:56:04,031
<i>Shut up!</i>

772
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:07,323
<i>Be quiet when the man is talking!</i>

773
00:56:10,114 --> 00:56:12,823
If there is a woman here tonight
who can come up here...

774
00:56:12,948 --> 00:56:17,573
...and prove me wrong.
I will shut my mouth and pay her $500!

775
00:56:18,864 --> 00:56:20,281
I can do it!

776
00:56:21,614 --> 00:56:22,948
Over here! Pick me!

777
00:56:23,073 --> 00:56:24,781
Who's gonna go? Who'll be the victor?

778
00:56:24,906 --> 00:56:26,864
Come on! You want to take me?
Come on!

779
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:28,698
We'll take one woman! You, ma'am.

780
00:56:28,823 --> 00:56:29,989
What's your name, sweetheart?

781
00:56:30,114 --> 00:56:31,698
- My name is Lynne.
- Lynne.

782
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:33,656
Lynne is the volunteer, all right.

783
00:56:33,781 --> 00:56:35,448
You're pathetic.

784
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:37,364
What are you gonna do about it, Suzy Q?

785
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:38,364
I want a clean fight.

786
00:56:38,489 --> 00:56:40,448
No kicking, biting, scratching, head-butts.

787
00:56:40,573 --> 00:56:42,448
- You understand?
- He's gonna play fair?

788
00:56:42,573 --> 00:56:44,156
I'm not concerned with him...

789
00:56:44,281 --> 00:56:46,948
It's up to you. You pin me.
I don't have to pin you.

790
00:56:47,031 --> 00:56:47,739
Yes, I understand.

791
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:50,156
Very good. Can we please shake hands?

792
00:56:52,281 --> 00:56:55,406
All right, into your respective corners.
Come out wrestling...

793
00:56:55,531 --> 00:56:57,198
...when you hear the bell.

794
00:57:01,948 --> 00:57:03,989
You see? You see this?

795
00:57:09,031 --> 00:57:10,239
Yeah!

796
00:57:14,698 --> 00:57:16,448
Lynne, no choke holds! I told you!

797
00:57:16,573 --> 00:57:18,073
Yeah! Come on!

798
00:57:21,698 --> 00:57:24,114
Hey, stop right there, Kaufman!

799
00:57:25,156 --> 00:57:26,614
- First warning!
- For what?

800
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:30,114
You pulled her hair! You won't be getting
a second warning, Kaufman!

801
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:31,614
That is enough! What'd I do?

802
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,739
Shut up! I am the champion.

803
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:35,406
No woman can...

804
00:57:43,989 --> 00:57:46,031
I'm mopping up the sweat.

805
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:55,948
One, two, three.

806
00:57:56,073 --> 00:57:58,739
That is it! Lt is over! Lt is over!

807
00:57:59,948 --> 00:58:01,698
You are out! You are down!

808
00:58:01,823 --> 00:58:04,656
The winner and still undisputed...

809
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:07,531
...Intergender Wrestling Champion
of the world...

810
00:58:07,656 --> 00:58:09,989
...Andy Kaufman!

811
00:58:10,281 --> 00:58:12,614
I am the winner!

812
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,739
I've got the brains!

813
00:58:27,823 --> 00:58:31,073
Ma'am? Here is your complimentary photo
of Merv.

814
00:58:31,198 --> 00:58:32,781
- Thank you.
- And your Turtle Wax.

815
00:58:32,906 --> 00:58:34,031
I don't want Turtle Wax.

816
00:58:34,156 --> 00:58:36,114
Every guest of Merv's takes Turtle Wax.

817
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:39,281
And here's your gift voucher
to Red Lobster for dinner for two.

818
00:58:39,406 --> 00:58:40,489
Thank you so much.

819
00:58:40,823 --> 00:58:43,906
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for doing such a great job.

820
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:46,281
- I really appreciate it.
- Don't patronize me.

821
00:58:46,406 --> 00:58:47,406
No, wait!

822
00:58:47,614 --> 00:58:48,531
What?

823
00:58:49,073 --> 00:58:51,906
I hope you don't take
everything I did in there seriously.

824
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,698
What I was saying, well,
it's just part of the show.

825
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,031
It's like the old days
of the carnival barker...

826
00:58:57,156 --> 00:58:59,406
...when he could get the crowd all riled up.

827
00:58:59,531 --> 00:59:01,489
So, you just pretend to be an asshole?

828
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,239
That's what I'm good at.

829
00:59:06,614 --> 00:59:10,906
Yeah, you are. You are, you are really,
really good at it. You are.

830
00:59:19,031 --> 00:59:22,031
Merv Griffin got 2,000 pieces of hate mail.

831
00:59:22,906 --> 00:59:25,114
Don't make me laugh, George.

832
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:28,198
Andy, Merv does not get hate mail.

833
00:59:28,323 --> 00:59:31,864
Well, that means we're a success.

834
00:59:33,656 --> 00:59:36,198
We got the room all worked up,
like punk rock.

835
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:37,906
Andy, they detest you.

836
00:59:39,198 --> 00:59:43,073
The next time you make an appearance
women are gonna picket.

837
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:44,698
You think so?

838
00:59:44,823 --> 00:59:48,781
Yes, because you have not given them
any clues that this is a parody.

839
00:59:49,406 --> 00:59:51,364
That's because I've only done it once.

840
00:59:51,489 --> 00:59:52,823
They'll get used to it.

841
00:59:52,948 --> 00:59:56,573
'Cause I'm gonna do it again and again,
and again and again.

842
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:37,739
Time-out!

843
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:46,698
All right, all right, you're out!
You are out! Get...

844
01:00:56,989 --> 01:01:00,281
Two adults, please. Thank you.

845
01:01:00,906 --> 01:01:02,239
Do you want some popcorn?

846
01:01:02,364 --> 01:01:03,656
No, thank you.

847
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:05,489
I really want one.

848
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:09,531
A large tub of popcorn, please.
Extra butter.

849
01:01:09,656 --> 01:01:11,156
So, why did you call me?

850
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:13,781
You are the last person
I expected to call me.

851
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:18,823
Gosh, gee, Lynne, I mean,
I was just so impressed...

852
01:01:18,948 --> 01:01:20,573
...with your wrestling moves, you know?

853
01:01:20,698 --> 01:01:23,864
Yeah, you were impressed with something.
You had a huge boner...

854
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:25,489
...on national TV.

855
01:01:25,614 --> 01:01:27,906
- Oh, man. Come on.
- Yeah, you did.

856
01:01:28,114 --> 01:01:30,323
I had it taped down and everything.

857
01:01:30,448 --> 01:01:31,989
I hope I didn't offend you.

858
01:01:32,114 --> 01:01:33,489
I'm here, aren't I?

859
01:01:33,614 --> 01:01:34,406
Hey!

860
01:01:34,823 --> 01:01:37,906
- What?
- Want to go to Memphis and get married?

861
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:42,489
Do I want to go to Memphis
and get married?

862
01:01:46,614 --> 01:01:48,031
Why Memphis?

863
01:01:48,323 --> 01:01:51,448
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital
of the world.

864
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:56,031
I'll get up in the ring and I'll announce
that I'll marry the first woman...

865
01:01:56,156 --> 01:01:58,114
...who beats me. Then you can get up...

866
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,406
...and we'll wrestle and I'll let you win...
- You'll let me win?

867
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:03,489
I'll let you win. I'll let you.

868
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:06,239
And then we'll run off
and we'll get married...

869
01:02:06,364 --> 01:02:08,156
<i>... on the David Letterman Show.</i>

870
01:02:08,281 --> 01:02:09,114
- God!
- Okay?

871
01:02:15,114 --> 01:02:16,739
What do you say?

872
01:02:18,448 --> 01:02:19,656
Is this for real?

873
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:20,948
<i>Shut up!</i>

874
01:02:21,156 --> 01:02:21,948
Boo!

875
01:02:22,073 --> 01:02:23,323
<i>Shut up!</i>

876
01:02:24,948 --> 01:02:28,364
<i>I demand silence when I am talking.</i>

877
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:32,864
<i>Total lack of respect from Mr. Hollywood.</i>

878
01:02:32,989 --> 01:02:36,489
<i>If there is one woman here tonight
who thinks she can defeat me...</i>

879
01:02:36,614 --> 01:02:41,073
<i>... that lucky little lady
will get to marry me!</i>

880
01:02:42,823 --> 01:02:44,114
<i>Let me ask you, folks:</i>

881
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:46,656
<i>What kind of man
would wrestle a woman, anyway?</i>

882
01:02:46,781 --> 01:02:47,906
Kaufman!

883
01:02:49,906 --> 01:02:51,156
Kaufman!

884
01:02:53,823 --> 01:02:56,031
I'll take you on, you sissy!

885
01:02:56,989 --> 01:02:58,823
<i>The little lady is upset.</i>

886
01:02:58,948 --> 01:03:01,864
<i>Let me tell you somethin', baby.
Go back to the kitchen...</i>

887
01:03:01,989 --> 01:03:04,406
<i>... where you belong,
before you get hurt, okay?</i>

888
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:07,406
<i>No, Kaufman, you get in the kitchen,
'cause I'll make you...</i>

889
01:03:07,531 --> 01:03:08,531
<i>... do my dishes!</i>

890
01:03:08,656 --> 01:03:10,114
<i>Hey! Stop it!</i>

891
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:13,906
<i>Stop it! This woman is a fake!</i>

892
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:18,448
<i>She's nothin' more
than Andy Kaufman's girlfriend.</i>

893
01:03:19,198 --> 01:03:20,073
<i>Right?</i>

894
01:03:20,448 --> 01:03:22,031
<i>Well, there you go.</i>

895
01:03:22,614 --> 01:03:23,906
<i>That's not true!</i>

896
01:03:24,031 --> 01:03:25,281
<i>- Boo!
- That's not true!</i>

897
01:03:25,406 --> 01:03:26,614
You big faker!

898
01:03:27,448 --> 01:03:28,739
<i>That is not true!</i>

899
01:03:28,864 --> 01:03:31,531
<i>Yeah, that's true.
This is all a set-up, Kaufman.</i>

900
01:03:31,614 --> 01:03:34,073
<i>And I'm not gonna allow you
to fool these people.</i>

901
01:03:34,198 --> 01:03:35,281
<i>You understand me?</i>

902
01:03:35,406 --> 01:03:37,031
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

903
01:03:37,448 --> 01:03:40,489
<i>I'm Jerry Lawler,
the King of Memphis wrestling!</i>

904
01:03:41,323 --> 01:03:42,281
<i>He's the King!</i>

905
01:03:42,406 --> 01:03:43,698
Right on!

906
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:50,198
<i>Kaufman, if you want to wrestle
somebody...</i>

907
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:52,281
<i>... I've got a real wrestler.</i>

908
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:55,031
<i>She's trained and she's ready.</i>

909
01:03:55,156 --> 01:03:58,823
<i>Let's see if you can handle Foxy Jackson!
Come on, Foxy!</i>

910
01:03:58,948 --> 01:03:59,781
<i>Oh, my!</i>

911
01:03:59,906 --> 01:04:02,781
<i>Foxy Jackson and Andy Kaufman...</i>

912
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:04,906
<i>... right here, one-on-one.</i>

913
01:04:05,323 --> 01:04:06,781
<i>I never agreed to this!</i>

914
01:04:06,906 --> 01:04:10,989
<i>I will not do this!
Lawler, I did not agree to this!</i>

915
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:12,489
<i>This is against the rules!</i>

916
01:04:12,614 --> 01:04:16,739
<i>I don't think that Kaufman was prepared
for Foxy Jackson.</i>

917
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:19,364
<i>Mr. Hollywood.</i>

918
01:04:22,198 --> 01:04:25,323
<i>Again, Kaufman showing
a total lack of respect.</i>

919
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:28,781
<i>Foxy Jackson's gonna take Kaufman
to the woodshed.</i>

920
01:04:34,656 --> 01:04:37,864
<i>Kaufman hangin' on the ropes
like a little baby!</i>

921
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:41,364
<i>Foxy's about to take Kaufman
right out of his shorts!</i>

922
01:05:03,114 --> 01:05:04,156
One, two, three.

923
01:05:04,281 --> 01:05:06,406
<i>- Can you believe it? Son of a gun!
- I got her!</i>

924
01:05:06,531 --> 01:05:08,614
<i>Come on, you wank, get off of her!</i>

925
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:10,656
<i>Get him off of her, come on.</i>

926
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,281
<i>Now, there goes the King...</i>

927
01:05:12,406 --> 01:05:16,198
<i>Oh, man! He just threw Kaufman down
like a rag doll!</i>

928
01:05:16,656 --> 01:05:18,739
<i>The King took matters into his own hands!</i>

929
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:20,406
- You all right?
- Sit her down.

930
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:23,531
What are you doing? I do not wrestle men!

931
01:05:24,114 --> 01:05:26,239
I am gonna sue you, Lawler!

932
01:05:26,448 --> 01:05:29,281
I am a national TV star...

933
01:05:29,406 --> 01:05:32,073
...and I don't like dumb, stupid crackers...

934
01:05:32,198 --> 01:05:34,364
...comin' into the ring, pushin' me around!

935
01:05:34,489 --> 01:05:36,239
I did not agree to wrestle you!

936
01:05:36,364 --> 01:05:37,406
I did not agree!

937
01:05:37,531 --> 01:05:39,614
This is assault and battery!

938
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:42,864
And I'm gonna get a team of lawyers
to sue you...

939
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:45,864
...and your children,
and your children's children!

940
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:48,156
Let me tell you somethin', Kaufman!

941
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,281
Wrestling's a very serious sport to me!

942
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:53,323
And I don't appreciate a jerk like you
makin' fun of it!

943
01:05:53,448 --> 01:05:55,573
I certainly don't appreciate
a jerk like you...

944
01:05:55,698 --> 01:05:57,531
...makin' fun of people from the South!

945
01:05:57,656 --> 01:06:00,906
So we can go to court if you want to!
Or you can get in the ring...

946
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:02,864
...with a man and wrestle for real!

947
01:06:02,989 --> 01:06:04,781
You wanna wrestle me?

948
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:07,739
You wanna wrestle me, Memphis god?

949
01:06:08,156 --> 01:06:10,156
Let me tell you somethin', Mr. Lawler.

950
01:06:10,281 --> 01:06:13,114
I am gonna make you scream for mercy!

951
01:06:13,364 --> 01:06:15,031
Come on, Kaufman!

952
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:26,614
They didn't know what hit them!

953
01:06:26,739 --> 01:06:28,198
Is it an act?

954
01:06:30,448 --> 01:06:33,323
Or are you just addicted
to causing trouble?

955
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,823
I can quit anytime I want, baby!

956
01:06:36,989 --> 01:06:41,281
You know what? I'm not a prop.
Don't ever treat me like that again.

957
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:43,448
I'm sorry.

958
01:06:46,989 --> 01:06:50,114
I just get caught up, that's all.

959
01:06:50,948 --> 01:06:52,948
Sometimes I get lost.

960
01:06:58,864 --> 01:07:01,698
Please, Andy, enough with the wrestling.

961
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:05,156
You don't think that I can beat him?

962
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:08,489
He's the southern heavyweight champion!
He'll kill you!

963
01:07:09,781 --> 01:07:12,948
I don't know. I've wrestled women
that are bigger than him...

964
01:07:13,073 --> 01:07:15,198
...and I've mopped the floor with 'em.

965
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,948
Well, first you piss off women...

966
01:07:17,073 --> 01:07:19,781
...then you piss off the South,
then you get killed.

967
01:07:19,906 --> 01:07:21,198
And I did the booking.

968
01:07:23,323 --> 01:07:26,864
It's funny. Listen, I got this job
that I want you to take.

969
01:07:27,073 --> 01:07:29,406
<i>It's guest-hosting
the TV show Fridays.</i>

970
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:32,614
It's not a great TV show,
but it'll be good for you.

971
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:36,323
<i>It's live, they'll give you
carte blanche...</i>

972
01:07:36,448 --> 01:07:40,323
...and you can get back in the business
of making people laugh.

973
01:07:41,531 --> 01:07:42,781
You said "live"?

974
01:07:42,906 --> 01:07:43,948
Live.

975
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:47,531
- I don't do drug humor.
- Andy, it's fine.

976
01:07:47,656 --> 01:07:50,739
This is what the show is all about.
Kids love this stuff.

977
01:07:50,864 --> 01:07:54,781
But I don't do drugs,
and I don't enjoy making light of them.

978
01:07:55,198 --> 01:07:57,406
I was promised creative control.

979
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,448
No one promised you creative control.

980
01:07:59,573 --> 01:08:02,323
You got the script three days ago,
and don't say a word...

981
01:08:02,448 --> 01:08:05,031
...until now. We're on live in minutes.
It's too late.

982
01:08:05,156 --> 01:08:07,073
Let's go! Bring the audience in!

983
01:08:07,198 --> 01:08:09,864
<i>- Live from the Los Angeles basin...
- Janice! Lt's on!</i>

984
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:11,198
<i>... it's Fridays!</i>

985
01:08:11,573 --> 01:08:13,864
<i>Tonight's special guest star...</i>

986
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:17,281
<i>... Andy Kaufman!</i>

987
01:08:17,698 --> 01:08:20,948
<i>In this sketch, two married couples
are out to dinner.</i>

988
01:08:21,073 --> 01:08:24,114
<i>Everybody has secretly
brought along a joint.</i>

989
01:08:25,906 --> 01:08:30,448
<i>And Carl was the last one to sneak
to the bathroom to get a little high.</i>

990
01:08:30,989 --> 01:08:33,698
<i>And now he's coming back to the table.</i>

991
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:41,031
Restaurants are amazing, aren't they?
All these strangers...

992
01:08:41,156 --> 01:08:44,448
...just sitting around, stuffing dead animals
into their faces.

993
01:08:44,573 --> 01:08:45,948
Incredible.

994
01:08:47,531 --> 01:08:48,739
Yeah. Gee.

995
01:08:49,406 --> 01:08:51,489
And the bathrooms are...

996
01:08:51,989 --> 01:08:53,948
<i>... so colorful.</i>

997
01:09:08,573 --> 01:09:10,614
Everything okay, Carl?

998
01:09:11,073 --> 01:09:14,156
I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

999
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:16,323
I can't play stoned.

1000
01:09:19,364 --> 01:09:20,573
Read the cue cards.

1001
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:24,739
I can't play stoned. I feel stupid.

1002
01:09:25,031 --> 01:09:26,406
You feel stupid?

1003
01:09:26,698 --> 01:09:28,239
What about us?

1004
01:09:42,698 --> 01:09:43,906
I'm sorry.

1005
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:45,864
I'm sorry.

1006
01:09:49,948 --> 01:09:51,114
Andy.

1007
01:09:54,739 --> 01:09:56,906
You didn't have to do that.

1008
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:02,031
Cut it out!

1009
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,823
Oh, you jerk!

1010
01:10:04,406 --> 01:10:06,489
Okay, that's it!
Joey, go to commercial, now!

1011
01:10:06,573 --> 01:10:08,864
I told you I didn't want to do this, didn't I?

1012
01:10:08,948 --> 01:10:11,656
Kaufman, get off my stage.
Get off my stage, man!

1013
01:10:11,739 --> 01:10:13,364
Get your hands off me.

1014
01:10:13,448 --> 01:10:15,239
Don't you touch me! You're a nut!

1015
01:10:15,323 --> 01:10:16,364
Break it up!

1016
01:10:16,448 --> 01:10:17,448
You are a nut!

1017
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:21,864
Why does Andy do that?

1018
01:10:21,948 --> 01:10:22,698
<i>Jesus, you are a nut! Come on!</i>

1019
01:10:22,781 --> 01:10:24,031
Why? Why?

1020
01:10:24,114 --> 01:10:25,489
<i>I started using Suave...</i>

1021
01:10:25,573 --> 01:10:27,156
We've gone to commercial!

1022
01:10:27,364 --> 01:10:28,281
Excuse me!

1023
01:10:28,364 --> 01:10:30,739
You're never gonna work
for ABC again, ever!

1024
01:10:30,823 --> 01:10:31,781
Excuse me?

1025
01:10:31,948 --> 01:10:34,073
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

1026
01:10:34,573 --> 01:10:37,823
You have all just participated
in a happening.

1027
01:10:46,698 --> 01:10:48,739
Now, okay, now...

1028
01:10:48,823 --> 01:10:52,156
...to make it real, some of you down there
knew what was going on...

1029
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,364
...and some of you didn't. I'm sorry.

1030
01:10:54,448 --> 01:10:57,323
But we don't want to upset
the folks at home...

1031
01:10:57,406 --> 01:11:02,198
...so now, Andy is going to tell them
that it was all just a prank.

1032
01:11:03,781 --> 01:11:06,323
<i>Coming back from commercial, and...</i>

1033
01:11:11,281 --> 01:11:14,114
During the commercials,
the people at ABC...

1034
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:17,989
<i>... told me to explain to you
that this whole fight episode...</i>

1035
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:19,198
<i>... was staged.</i>

1036
01:11:19,281 --> 01:11:20,614
Oh, good.

1037
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:21,906
<i>It's a lie!</i>

1038
01:11:21,989 --> 01:11:24,114
<i>It's a cover-up! Why are you laughing?</i>

1039
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:27,281
<i>I don't understand why you're laughing.
I'm not being funny.</i>

1040
01:11:27,364 --> 01:11:28,864
<i>What you saw was real!</i>

1041
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:31,989
<i>These things occur
all the time at the networks...</i>

1042
01:11:32,073 --> 01:11:33,406
<i>... only they're cut away.</i>

1043
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:34,698
Cut to commercial.

1044
01:11:34,781 --> 01:11:35,698
You see?

1045
01:11:35,781 --> 01:11:36,656
You see?

1046
01:11:37,114 --> 01:11:40,156
<i>Now, for sure they'll fire me.
If you want to see me again...</i>

1047
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:41,781
<i>... you'll have to come to Memphis...</i>

1048
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:43,156
NIBLETS CORN
In Butter Sauce

1049
01:11:44,073 --> 01:11:45,448
What's in Memphis?

1050
01:11:45,531 --> 01:11:48,364
<i>The giant's flavor-tight pouch
lets you cook the corn in...</i>

1051
01:11:48,448 --> 01:11:49,364
<i>That kid is totally meshuga.</i>

1052
01:11:57,489 --> 01:12:01,073
<i>Jerry "the King" Lawler!</i>

1053
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:08,739
<i>The most popular athlete...</i>

1054
01:12:08,989 --> 01:12:11,823
<i>... in the history of Memphis, Tennessee...</i>

1055
01:12:11,906 --> 01:12:14,406
<i>... steppin' inside a square circle.</i>

1056
01:12:17,114 --> 01:12:19,656
<i>At 236 pounds...</i>

1057
01:12:22,031 --> 01:12:26,906
<i>... Jerry "the King" Lawler!</i>

1058
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,906
<i>And introducing, at 191 pounds...</i>

1059
01:12:36,739 --> 01:12:38,073
<i>... the holder of...</i>

1060

<i>... the World Intergender Championship...</i>

1061

<i>... here is Andy Kaufman!</i>

1062
01:12:47,573 --> 01:12:50,781
<i>You can hear the ovation or lack of one
for Andy Kaufman.</i>

1063
01:12:50,864 --> 01:12:52,948
<i>The cheers turn to jeers.</i>

1064
01:12:54,864 --> 01:12:58,406
<i>Yeah, Lawler is gonna settle the score
for each and every one of us...</i>

1065
01:12:58,489 --> 01:13:02,281
<i>... because we've all been insulted
by this hideous Andy Kaufman.</i>

1066
01:13:02,364 --> 01:13:04,989
<i>This man from Hollywood, California...</i>

1067
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:14,073
<i>Before we begin this event,
I just want to say a couple of things...</i>

1068
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:16,406
<i>... to you disgusting people!</i>

1069
01:13:16,573 --> 01:13:17,864
Come on!

1070
01:13:17,989 --> 01:13:20,114
Now, that's just not right.

1071
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,573
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

1072
01:13:25,406 --> 01:13:26,614
<i>Okay!</i>

1073
01:13:27,948 --> 01:13:29,948
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1074
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:33,698
<i>... this is a bar of soap.</i>

1075
01:13:35,531 --> 01:13:36,906
<i>Say it with me.</i>

1076
01:13:36,989 --> 01:13:38,031
<i>Soap.</i>

1077
01:13:38,573 --> 01:13:42,531
<i>All you have to do is wet this bar of soap...</i>

1078
01:13:42,614 --> 01:13:46,073
<i>... and wipe your hands with it
and rub it on your body...</i>

1079
01:13:46,364 --> 01:13:50,614
<i>... and soon that disgusting, filthy dirt...</i>

1080
01:13:50,698 --> 01:13:51,864
<i>... will come off!</i>

1081
01:13:51,948 --> 01:13:53,823
Why is he saying these things?

1082
01:13:53,906 --> 01:13:57,156
He's just engaging the audience.
He's riling them up.

1083
01:13:57,239 --> 01:13:59,073
They are going to lynch him.

1084
01:13:59,156 --> 01:14:01,239
<i>And now for lesson two.</i>

1085
01:14:02,281 --> 01:14:05,489
<i>This is toilet paper!</i>

1086
01:14:05,573 --> 01:14:07,406
<i>- Good grief.
- Use it!</i>

1087
01:14:09,281 --> 01:14:12,781
<i>Let me tell you something, Kaufman.
We've had enough of your crap.</i>

1088
01:14:12,864 --> 01:14:16,614
<i>Now, let's do what we came here to do,
let's wrestle, right now!</i>

1089
01:14:16,698 --> 01:14:20,031
<i>All right, here we go.
The King is ready, and I hope...</i>

1090
01:14:20,114 --> 01:14:22,614
<i>... for Kaufman's sake, he's ready.</i>

1091
01:14:28,656 --> 01:14:31,323
<i>Kaufman's due a trip
to the old woodshed here.</i>

1092
01:14:34,156 --> 01:14:37,114
<i>I never thought I'd see the day that...</i>

1093
01:14:37,281 --> 01:14:39,198
<i>Well, look at Kaufman!</i>

1094
01:14:39,864 --> 01:14:42,656
<i>Yeah, Kaufman doesn't want
any part of Lawler.</i>

1095
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:45,281
<i>He's an absolute embarrassment
to humanity...</i>

1096
01:14:45,364 --> 01:14:46,989
<i>... this man from Hollywood.</i>

1097
01:14:47,073 --> 01:14:49,948
<i>You see, I am from Hollywood.</i>

1098
01:14:50,031 --> 01:14:52,281
<i>- Who cares?

Kaufman!

1110
01:15:23,948 --> 01:15:27,448
Did you come down here
to wrestle or act like an ass?

1111
01:15:28,573 --> 01:15:31,573
Now get in the ring!
I'll give you a free headlock, okay?

1112
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:32,448
Come on!

1113
01:15:32,531 --> 01:15:36,073
<i>Lawler seems to be willing
to offer a free hold here of some kind.</i>

1114
01:15:36,656 --> 01:15:38,823
No, not now, drop it! Drop it, now!

1115
01:15:38,906 --> 01:15:40,364
It'll be okay! Lt's okay.

One, two, three.

<i>I can't believe that the King
is gonna go through with this.</i>

1119

Come on!

1120
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:56,739
<i>That big-mouth son of a gun
has got a free headlock!</i>

1121
01:15:56,823 --> 01:15:58,698
<i>And business may pick up here!</i>

1122
01:15:58,781 --> 01:16:02,448
I did it! This is for real! I did it! Yeah!

1123
01:16:02,823 --> 01:16:04,573
<i>Look out, Kaufman!</i>

1124
01:16:05,489 --> 01:16:07,781

1126
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:14,323
<i>Look out!</i>

1127
01:16:18,989 --> 01:16:22,239
<i>The King folded him up

1128
01:16:23,531 --> 01:16:27,989
<i>And now the King is asking the crowd
if they want to see the piledriver.</i>

1129
01:16:28,114 --> 01:16:31,698
<i>That's illegal. Kaufman is out of it.</i>

1130
01:16:32,364 --> 01:16:34,239

Andy!

1134

<i>And he's hurt bad. That's an automatic
disqualification, right there.</i>

1135

<i>Well, Kaufman wins, but he doesn't
look like a winner, right now.</i>

Hey, George.

1138
01:17:01,989 --> 01:17:04,864
Hey, Lorne. Thanks for seeing me
at such short notice.

1139
01:17:10,823 --> 01:17:14,156
I wanted to talk to you
about putting Andy...

1140
01:17:14,281 --> 01:17:16,781
<i>... back on Saturday Night Live.</i>

1141
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:23,489
George, I don't know whether Andy
works on the show, anymore.

1142
01:17:23,573 --> 01:17:25,823
I mean, the wrestling stuff is...

1143
01:17:26,323 --> 01:17:28,448
- Yeah...
- Just, I think it's worn...

1144
01:17:28,531 --> 01:17:31,864
The wrestling.
Yeah, we all agree completely about...

1145
01:17:32,906 --> 01:17:35,531
...the wrestling, now.
- That's smart.

1146
01:17:37,448 --> 01:17:39,364
Andy is very sincere.

1147
01:17:39,948 --> 01:17:42,489
He's gonna apologize to Jerry Lawler...

1148
01:17:42,573 --> 01:17:45,156
...and repent for all his bad guy
shenanigans.

1149
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:48,198
I apologize for all the wrestling
I've ever done...

1150
01:17:48,281 --> 01:17:51,406
...and I'm sorry for all the grief
I've ever given.

1151
01:17:51,906 --> 01:17:56,323
I was just playing bad guy wrestler,
you know, and it's just a role.

1152
01:17:56,531 --> 01:18:00,073
It's not me. So, I guess Jerry just...

1153
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:02,989
...took it personally.

1154
01:18:03,073 --> 01:18:06,573
I mean, you said some pretty
inflammatory things, obviously.

1155
01:18:06,698 --> 01:18:09,031
Right, I mean,
everything's a joke to this guy.

1156
01:18:09,114 --> 01:18:11,448
Like that thing. Is it a neck brace...

1157
01:18:11,531 --> 01:18:13,531
...or a flea collar?
- That's not true.

1158
01:18:13,614 --> 01:18:16,073
This is very serious. I went to the hospital.

1159
01:18:16,156 --> 01:18:18,823
<i>I was in the hospital for three days,
in traction.</i>

1160
01:18:18,906 --> 01:18:22,198
<i>And I'll tell you something else.
My dad said I could've sued you.</i>

1161
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:24,656
I could have sued you
for everything you've got.

1162
01:18:24,739 --> 01:18:27,614
But I didn't because I'm not that kinda guy.

1163
01:18:29,531 --> 01:18:31,531
What kinda guy are you?

1164
01:18:43,364 --> 01:18:47,239
Tell you what, I think maybe
I'll get a lawyer, you know?

1165
01:18:48,489 --> 01:18:51,573
Listen, if you were a man,
you'd apologize to me right now.

1166
01:18:51,656 --> 01:18:54,281
But you're just poor, white trash,
and so I guess...

1167
01:18:54,364 --> 01:18:56,489
...that's too lofty a concept for you.

1168
01:18:56,573 --> 01:18:59,364
I mean, you know, what are you gonna do?

1169
01:19:06,989 --> 01:19:09,406
<i>Are we, is everything, are you okay?</i>

1170
01:19:12,531 --> 01:19:14,156
I'm sick of this shit, Lawler.

1171
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:16,781
I'm gonna sue you
for everything you've got...

1172
01:19:16,864 --> 01:19:18,031
...I swear to God.

1173
01:19:18,114 --> 01:19:18,906
Fuck you!

1174
01:19:18,989 --> 01:19:20,656
Okay? Okay, Lawler?

1175
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:22,656
Fuck you! I'm sorry Dave. Okay?

<i>This is Saturday Night Live,
the hippest audience in television.</i>

They turned on you.

1194
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,364
Look, it pains me to say this...

...but I don't think you two guys

You don't have to be sorry, Jerry.
You're terrific.

Me, too.

1202

And it was a shining moment
for behavioral science.

1203
01:20:59,906 --> 01:21:02,781
But, why can't I make a gag out of this?
I mean...

1204
01:21:02,864 --> 01:21:05,906
...maybe I could go on the show,
and I could...

1205
01:21:05,989 --> 01:21:09,739
...I could say it was rigged
and that I demand a recount.

Andy, you don't understand.

They don't want you back.

It's just your stress...

Hi.

1220
01:22:01,489 --> 01:22:05,781
This is very difficult for me to say...

1221
01:22:10,906 --> 01:22:13,448
...but we feel that it's best...

1222
01:22:13,531 --> 01:22:16,114
...if you don't attend the retreat.

1223
01:22:18,573 --> 01:22:19,531
Why?

1224
01:22:21,906 --> 01:22:23,573
I go to the retreat every year.

1225
01:22:23,656 --> 01:22:26,906
I know, Andy,
and we don't doubt your devotion...

1226
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:30,489
...to transcendental meditation.
It's just that we feel that...

1227
01:22:30,573 --> 01:22:34,406
...well, you and the program
have grown apart...

1228
01:22:34,989 --> 01:22:36,573
Philosophically.

1229
01:22:36,656 --> 01:22:38,864
"Philosophically?"
What's "philosophically"?

1230
01:22:38,948 --> 01:22:42,281
Well, Andy, the wrestling,
the sexist remarks, the foul language...

1231
01:22:42,364 --> 01:22:45,906
...they're just not becoming of an individual
of spiritual enlightenment.

1232
01:22:45,989 --> 01:22:49,323
It seems you just don't respect anything.

1233
01:22:50,739 --> 01:22:55,906
Of course I do. It's just I think of the world
as an illusion...

1234
01:22:55,989 --> 01:22:58,864
...and we shouldn't take ourselves
so seriously.

1235
01:22:58,948 --> 01:23:00,198
Don't...

1236
01:23:01,948 --> 01:23:06,239
Don't, please do this.

1237
01:23:06,698 --> 01:23:09,864
You've got to let me attend these classes.

1238
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:11,698
It's what keeps me balanced.

1239
01:23:11,781 --> 01:23:14,031
It's apparently not working.

1240
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:17,823
Then help me. Help me, okay? Guide me.

1241
01:23:19,614 --> 01:23:22,364
We just don't wish your presence here.

1242

Hi.

01:23:33,823 --> 01:23:35,823
I brought you some Haagen-Dazs.

1244
01:23:38,156 --> 01:23:40,406
I don't deserve Haagen-Dazs.

1245
01:23:41,781 --> 01:23:42,948
I'm a bad person.

1246
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:44,239
Don't.

1247
01:23:48,781 --> 01:23:50,864
You aren't a bad person.

1248
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:54,239
You are a complicated person.

1249
01:23:55,156 --> 01:23:57,323
You don't know the real me.

1250
01:23:59,323 --> 01:24:01,323
There isn't a real you.

1251
01:24:04,198 --> 01:24:06,239
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

1252
01:24:12,364 --> 01:24:13,531
Baby.

1253
01:24:17,156 --> 01:24:19,531
Do you want to move in with me?

1254
01:24:21,448 --> 01:24:24,198
What? Say it again.

1255
01:24:29,323 --> 01:24:34,489
"Oh, Rose Marie

1256
01:24:35,989 --> 01:24:38,698
"I love you

1257
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:45,156
"I'm always dreaming of you"

1258
01:24:58,614 --> 01:25:00,073

<i>Andy, it's George.</i>

Hey, George. I'm not sure
we can do anything for you.

1262
01:25:15,698 --> 01:25:18,489
<i>Andy, I got some crummy news.</i>

1263
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:22,948
<i>Taxi has been canceled.</i>

1264
01:25:23,031 --> 01:25:24,656
Put that stuff over there.

1265
01:25:24,739 --> 01:25:26,448
And the crummy news?

1266

<i>You want me to come over
and talk about it?</i>

1267
01:25:33,239 --> 01:25:35,448
No. I'm sort of busy, right now.

1268
01:25:35,739 --> 01:25:38,531
I'll see you next week, though. Thanks.

1269
01:25:44,698 --> 01:25:47,448
Yeah, okay. Put it right there. Right there.

1270
01:26:03,989 --> 01:26:04,531
Yuck.

1271

1274

<i>Actually, Budd, you're wrong.</i>

1275
01:26:23,448 --> 01:26:26,739
<i>I found out today
that Taxi has been canceled.</i>

1276
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:28,614
What?

1277
01:26:29,823 --> 01:26:32,323
<i>Not to mention that my wife left me...</i>

1278
01:26:33,948 --> 01:26:35,864
<i>... and she took the kids.</i>

1279
01:26:38,656 --> 01:26:41,781
<i>I don't understand why you're laughing.
I'm not joking.</i>

1280
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:44,656
<i>And then this morning...</i>

1281
01:26:44,739 --> 01:26:49,739
<i>... I got up and I noticed
that I have a cyst, or some kind of boil...</i>

1282
01:26:49,906 --> 01:26:52,031
<i>... on the back of my neck.</i>

1283
01:26:53,114 --> 01:26:53,989
<i>Look.</i>

1284
01:26:54,531 --> 01:26:55,656
<i>See?</i>

1285
01:26:55,948 --> 01:26:58,114
<i>So I was thinking that since...</i>

1286
01:26:58,531 --> 01:27:03,156
<i>... I'm still kind of a quasi-celebrity, that...</i>

1287
01:27:03,656 --> 01:27:06,989
<i>... maybe I could charge people to touch it.</i>

1288
01:27:08,948 --> 01:27:12,198
<i>Would anybody like to pay $1
to touch my cyst?</i>

1289
01:27:14,573 --> 01:27:18,073
<i>I'm serious. I could really use
the money, right now.</i>

1290
01:27:18,448 --> 01:27:20,156
<i>It's a good deal.</i>

1291
01:27:24,864 --> 01:27:25,906
<i>Okay.</i>

1292
01:27:26,364 --> 01:27:28,781
<i>Wait, no, you gotta pay first.</i>

1293
01:27:30,573 --> 01:27:34,489
<i>It's $1 to touch my celebrity cyst.</i>

1294
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:36,573
<i>Okay.</i>

1295
01:27:58,781 --> 01:27:59,906
Thank you.

1296
01:27:59,989 --> 01:28:01,531
Thank you very much.

1297
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:10,656
Would Andy like to tell us
why he called us out...

1298
01:28:10,739 --> 01:28:12,864
...at 4:00 in the morning?

1299
01:28:16,156 --> 01:28:17,156
Yeah.

1300
01:28:19,031 --> 01:28:20,323
I have cancer.

1301
01:28:24,156 --> 01:28:26,739
Forget it. Forget it!

1302
01:28:26,906 --> 01:28:29,281
That is in terrible taste.

1303
01:28:29,989 --> 01:28:32,364
I don't want to have anything
to do with this.

1304
01:28:32,448 --> 01:28:36,489
No, no, no, that's good.
Yeah, we can make that play.

1305
01:28:38,031 --> 01:28:42,198
Yeah, okay. And we'll just, we'll really,
we'll just drag it out.

1306
01:28:42,531 --> 01:28:45,281
All right? You get better, you get worse...

1307
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:50,406
No, you die!
And then, you come back to life.

1308
01:28:51,781 --> 01:28:53,489
That's funny.

1309
01:28:54,114 --> 01:28:57,989
That's funny, but, it's not a gag, Bob.

1310
01:28:58,073 --> 01:29:00,614
I got cancer. I got lung cancer.

1311
01:29:01,739 --> 01:29:05,906
Lung cancer? That's ridiculous,
you don't even smoke.

1312
01:29:06,656 --> 01:29:10,989
I've got some freaky, rare kind.
It's called large cell carcinoma.

1313
01:29:13,573 --> 01:29:15,073
I'm a lucky guy.

1314
01:29:28,448 --> 01:29:30,364
Have you told your family?

1315
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:33,281
No. I don't want to tell them.

1316
01:29:38,073 --> 01:29:39,406
I just...

1317
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:46,281
I've jerked 'em around so much.

1318
01:29:50,948 --> 01:29:55,614
Andy, look in my eye,
and tell me this is true.

1319
01:29:57,614 --> 01:29:59,156
Oh, I'm sorry.

1320
01:29:59,989 --> 01:30:01,573
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1321
01:30:02,364 --> 01:30:03,573
I'm sorry.

1322
01:30:04,489 --> 01:30:06,948
Lynne! Come on.

1323
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:14,989
If I find out that you're behind this,
I'll kill you, Zmuda!

1324
01:30:15,114 --> 01:30:19,406
What the hell are you talkin' about George?
I was the one who didn't believe him.

1325
01:30:19,864 --> 01:30:22,781
That's the kinda thing that you two
would work out to fuck me up!

1326

<i>We want the truth, boy. The truth!</i>

<i>My father said Lassie bit me,
so, I said she did, too.</i>

1328
01:30:28,448 --> 01:30:30,823
<i>Lassie never bit you, and you know it.</i>

1329
01:30:30,906 --> 01:30:32,239
<i>Case dismissed!</i>

1330
01:30:55,073 --> 01:30:55,614
Dad?

1331
01:30:57,114 --> 01:31:00,948
The cancer started here in Andy's lungs
and spread to his left arm.

1332
01:31:01,698 --> 01:31:04,864
We've initiated
an aggressive radiation program.

1333
01:31:04,948 --> 01:31:07,573
See if we can eradicate the affected cells.

- Excuse me, I'll be right back.</i>

1335
01:31:16,448 --> 01:31:17,698
What a crock.

1336
01:31:20,698 --> 01:31:23,114
How dare you make light of this?

1337
01:31:23,281 --> 01:31:26,406
Dad, I cried when he broke his neck.
He's not getting me again.

1338
01:31:26,489 --> 01:31:28,989
Jesus Christ, Carol, he's got lung cancer.

1339
01:31:29,073 --> 01:31:32,906
He wants us scratching our heads,
asking ourselves, "Is this real?"

1340
01:31:33,698 --> 01:31:35,198
Of course it's real.

1341
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:36,823
We're in a hospital.

1342
01:31:36,906 --> 01:31:39,364
Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai.

1343
01:31:40,281 --> 01:31:42,073
It's a show biz hospital.

1344
01:31:42,323 --> 01:31:44,823
Andy's studio friends
probably run this place.

1345
01:31:44,906 --> 01:31:48,198
He plans these things.
He takes over and hires actors.

1346
01:31:49,073 --> 01:31:52,323
Personally, I didn't think that doctor guy
was very convincing.

1347
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:55,948
- Did you notice he had the wrong shoes?
- He didn't have doctor shoes.

NATIONAL

No, that's bullshit!

1350
01:31:59,448 --> 01:32:02,281
No more Kaufman stories.
He's burned us too many times.

1351
01:32:02,364 --> 01:32:05,864
A very reliable source told me,
Andy Kaufman has lung cancer.

1352
01:32:06,031 --> 01:32:08,406
Please, he's definitely not dying.

1353
01:32:09,031 --> 01:32:14,073
Now those big white cells
are attacking the cancer cells.

1354
01:32:15,031 --> 01:32:18,531
Attacking. Attacking.

1355
01:32:18,906 --> 01:32:21,864
- I see them. I see the white cells.
- Attacking.

1356
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,823
Attacking.

1357
01:32:24,364 --> 01:32:26,281
- Attacking.
- Attacking.

1358
01:32:40,573 --> 01:32:42,114
He's an actor.

<i>I recognize him from The In-Laws!</i>

1360

That's true. But he's also ordained
in holistic medicine.

1361
01:32:57,823 --> 01:32:59,239
What am I supposed to do?

1362
01:32:59,323 --> 01:33:03,656
I'm sick and I'm tryin' to get better,
but everybody's lookin' at me funny.

1363
01:33:04,406 --> 01:33:07,489
I feel like I'm being surrounded
by negative energy.

1364
01:33:14,573 --> 01:33:17,281
You're surrounded by what you create.

1365
01:33:17,489 --> 01:33:18,406
Oh, great.

1366
01:33:18,489 --> 01:33:21,823
- Andy, you're the king of negative energy.
- It's gotta stop.

1367
01:33:22,698 --> 01:33:23,573
Andy.

1368
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:28,531
'Cause if these negative vibes get out,
then everyone'll talk about how sick I am.

1369
01:33:28,614 --> 01:33:31,156
And it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

1370
01:33:31,781 --> 01:33:33,573
How can I help you?

1371
01:33:38,864 --> 01:33:41,989
- I want to go back to work.
- You want to tour the clubs?

1372
01:33:42,073 --> 01:33:45,739
No, no clubs. I want to reach the top.

01:33:53,948 --> 01:33:58,073
I want it to be everything that's joyful,
just pile one thing on top of the other...

1376
01:33:58,156 --> 01:34:01,448
...until the audience just turn into children
right in front of me.

1377
01:34:01,573 --> 01:34:04,531
- It might even have Santa Claus.
- Oh, yeah.

1378
01:34:04,864 --> 01:34:08,364
And you can say, "Santa, what am I gettin'
for Christmas this year?"

1379
01:34:08,448 --> 01:34:10,364
And he says, "Cancer".

1380
01:34:10,948 --> 01:34:12,406
No, not that.

1381
01:34:12,489 --> 01:34:15,156
I don't want to do that. That's a bummer.

1382
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:17,698
Okay, positive.

1383
01:34:17,864 --> 01:34:21,573
This is really, great. Santa, snow...

1384
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:24,406
But it's going to cost a fortune.

1385
01:34:24,656 --> 01:34:26,656
That's okay. Not a problem.

1386
01:34:27,614 --> 01:34:30,531
- Well, who's gonna pay for it, Andy?
- Tony Clifton?

1387
01:34:33,989 --> 01:34:36,948
Andy, Tony doesn't have
that kind of money.

1388
01:34:37,073 --> 01:34:40,906
Don't you worry about that, George.
I know Tony a lot better than you do.

1389
01:34:40,989 --> 01:34:45,489
And even if he has to work for another
ten years to pay it off, he'll do it.

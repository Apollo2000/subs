3
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,660
- Hey.
- I got it. That's all right.

4
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:44,931
Shit.

5
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:46,698
Oh...

6
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:49,401
Hey. You're Allison?

7
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:51,736
Yeah. You're Gabe?

8
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:54,139
That bag has wheels.

9
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:56,707
Ah, it's fine.
It's light.

10
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,379
So you're a film director?

11
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,715
Mike told you that?

12
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:06,184
Oh, you know Mike?

13
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:08,988
No, Mike didn't say anything.
Just the vibe I'm pickin' up.

14
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:11,324
Oh, that's funny.
What else did he tell you about me?

15
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:13,325
No... No, nothin'.

16
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:17,129
He said, uh, you used to be an
actress and now you're a director.

17
00:04:17,163 --> 00:04:19,397
- Mmm.
- I swear to... I swear to God.

18
00:04:21,234 --> 00:04:24,669
Why'd you give it up,
acting?

19
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,206
I didn't.

20
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,673
I think people

21
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:30,142
just sort of

22
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:33,346
stopped
hiring me, maybe.

23
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:35,281
But I'm actually happier
doing what I'm doing.

24
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:37,315
At least now I can
eat cookies sometimes.

25
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,219
What was it,
were you difficult?

26
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:42,020
Man, you're nosy.

27
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:43,421
Um, I don't know,
maybe I,

28
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:46,025
maybe I just
wasn't attractive enough.

29
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:49,027
Oh, yeah. Mike mentioned that you
like to fish around for compliments.

30
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,796
Well, that is not true.
I do not like compliments.

31
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:55,333
Well, I don't think
that's why I stopped.

32
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:00,906
You really don't need
to prove anything to me.

33
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,242
I... I prefer weak...

34
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:05,378
sickly men.

35
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,245
Is that what
your husband's like?

36
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:11,850
I don't have
a husband.

37
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:13,385
No?

38
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:15,421
'Cause Mike said that your
husband was gonna be joining us.

39
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:18,323
Yeah, I thought you told me
everything he said about me.

40
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:19,991
I don't have a husband.

41
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:23,396
No one's joining me, Gabe.

42
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:24,996
I'm all alone
in this world.

43
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,331
Okay? Happy?

44
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:28,034
Any other questions?

45
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,302
Well, a few.

46
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:31,002
I bet.

47
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:32,905
So, what kind
of movies do you make?

48
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,375
Um, unsuccessful, small ones

49
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:39,778
that nobody likes.

50
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,259
Hey.

51
00:05:55,493 --> 00:05:56,796
What are you doin'?

52
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:57,997
Morning, honey.

53
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,432
Doctor said second trimester

54
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:01,299
you shouldn't
be lifting heavy things.

55
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,269
Well, it's Friday.

56
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:05,937
- Right? You forgot last week. Can you...?
- I'm looking out for you.

57
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:10,243
- Hi. I'm Allison.
- Oh, I know. I'm Blair.

58
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,478
You're really pretty.

59
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,283
No, I meant that
as a compliment.

60
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:20,252
No, I know. I know.
I, uh...

61
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:22,221
You are too.

62
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:26,224
- You are!
- No. No, it's...

63
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:29,428
You don't have to do that. I was just
telling him how much I hate compliments.

64
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:31,096
Apparently, we have that
in common.

65
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,832
Well, I like compliments.

66
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:34,400
I don't know why I'm spending
all this money on doctors

67
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:36,034
if we're not gonna
take her advice.

68
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:38,503
- "You"?
- We're. Whatever.

69
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:41,172
- I know what the doctor said. I was there.
- I don't want you...

70
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:44,242
I don't want to talk about this right now.

71
00:06:44,276 --> 00:06:45,844
- Gabe.
- I'm looking out for you.

72
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:47,480
Gabe, your wife wants
to move on.

73
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,214
Ah, no, we're not married.

74
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:54,085
Where's your husband?

75
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,856
I don't have a husband.

76
00:06:57,956 --> 00:06:59,492
Anyway, can I just
get her set up?

77
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,459
I was hoping to get into
the studio sometime this week,

78
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:03,795
or century.

79
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:08,433
I like your overalls.

80
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:09,968
They're really cute.

81
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:12,304
I like your bag.

82
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:14,539
I told you,
I don't like compliments.

83
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:59,951
I just feel like
I asked you three or four times

84
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:02,888
and you keep saying you're going to do
it, but then you just don't do it.

85
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:05,090
So, I just did it eventually
because just didn't want

86
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:07,025
to keep asking you to do it.

87
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:09,328
I kept smelling garbage
when making my coffee.

88
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:11,497
I don't understand
how you can drink your coffee

89
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,065
and smell garbage
over here.

90
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,435
Because your sense of smell
is way more sensitive right now.

91
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:18,002
Absolutely.

92
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:06,479
Hi.

93
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:08,012
Hey.

94
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:12,283
- You gonna go for a swim?
- Yeah.

95
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,719
Oh, let me show you down.

96
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:16,255
Okay.

97
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:18,122
I don't know how you do it
this time of year.

98
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:19,257
It's so cold.

99
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,160
I know, I'm weird.
I love the cold.

100
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:36,575
So it's just up the stairs...

101
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:41,199
Mm.

102
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:11,864
Mm. This is really good, Gabe.

103
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:24,275
Did you pick those?

104
00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:26,345
Mm-hm.

105
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:28,714
Did you pick the ones
in my room too?

106
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,248
Yeah.

107
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:32,250
You are a great host.

108
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:38,657
Do you want some wine?

109
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:39,925
Are you gonna have some?

110
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,627
Yeah, I could have a little.

111
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,928
Okay.

112
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:55,908
So do you guys
have a plan for this place?

113
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:57,609
Are you gonna turn it
into a B&B or...?

114
00:13:57,643 --> 00:14:00,512
No. Um, I don't really know
what we're doing.

115
00:14:00,546 --> 00:14:03,348
We just sort of put
the word out to our friends

116
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:05,451
that were creative,
or whatever,

117
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:08,620
that we had this place,
that it would make a great retreat

118
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:10,289
or maybe even a place
to do film shoots or...

119
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:11,724
Yeah, we could meet
some cool people

120
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:13,257
and maybe make
a little money.

121
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,562
Yeah. It wasn't really
about the money.

122
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:18,396
This place has been in Gabe's
family for a really long time.

123
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,365
- Yeah. We...
- Oh. That's cool.

124
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,901
We used to have these, um,
huge family reunion type thing...

125
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:24,937
Now everybody hates
each other though, so... Heh.

126
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,973
No, not everybody.

127
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:29,007
It's just, the family's not
as close as they used to be.

128
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,642
- Mm.
- Point is, no one's ever here anymore.

129
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:34,847
When Blair got pregnant,
we just kind of decided...

130
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,648
Mm, we didn't
really decide exactly.

131
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:39,785
We were... we were
living in Brooklyn

132
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:42,020
and it was getting
so expensive,

133
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:43,822
and we weren't
really working, so...

134
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:44,823
Ah. Yeah.

135
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:45,891
No.

136
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:47,726
- Well, what?
- Nah.

137
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,396
The idea of moving out here
appealed to us, yeah,

138
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,899
but I don't think we would've
left if we had jobs.

139
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:55,433
We had jobs.

140
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,438
We had jobs. Heh.

141
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,572
- Yeah, I mean...
- You...

142
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:03,042
I was a dancer.

143
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,476
Well, I wanted to be,

144
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,478
but I wasn't really
making any money.

145
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:09,048
And I was hostessing, but Gabe really thought that I...

146
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:12,985
Yeah, I just didn't want her being on
her feet all the time, and... late hours

147
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:15,988
and not... never sleeping, and this
place was just sitting here empty, so...

148
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:18,322
He's mom's been trying
to sell it for years.

149
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:20,092
Well, no, it hasn't been years.
It's been a year and a half.

150
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,660
Two years.

151
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:24,696
She's been selling it,

152
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,098
trying to sell it,
for two years.

153
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:28,000
She's...

154
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:30,002
She's not
the most realistic person.

155
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:32,738
It's not that, it's just that
she doesn't need to sell it.

156
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:36,675
Okay. She's not gonna get what
she's asking for it anyway, so...

157
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,544
And she was paying
this caretaker...

158
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:40,113
What about you?
What was your job?

159
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:41,613
Gabe was a musician.

160
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:43,514
I... Well, I am a musician.

161
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:46,385
It's not so... It's not
something you stop being.

162
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:48,053
I just meant
professionally.

163
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,890
I'm still a professional.

164
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,491
I still get royalties.

165
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,463
The last royalty he got
was for 53 cents.

166
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:03,368
It's what I do for my life.

167
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:04,803
I'm a professional musician.

168
00:16:04,837 --> 00:16:06,437
Hm.

169
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,040
I used to play
in different bands.

170
00:16:08,073 --> 00:16:11,043
Real, successful bands.

171
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:13,045
I would be on the road,
depending on the year,

172
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:14,446
six, eight months.

173
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,815
Wow, that must've
been hard for you.

174
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:19,785
Mm, I don't know.
I'm a pretty independent person.

175
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:20,987
Heh, she hated it.

176
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:24,990
I didn't hate it.

177
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:27,026
I... I didn't hate it.

178
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,028
There were a variety
of reasons we moved up here,

179
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:32,431
none of which was
to start a B&B.

180
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:40,372
You're so lucky.

181
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,574
What do you mean?

182
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,577
You've got a guy who cooks.

183
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,781
I can't cook.

184
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:50,816
Like, at all.

185
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:52,818
Like, anything?

186
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:54,519
Can you cook eggs?

187
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,457
I can scramble an egg.
Maybe.

188
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,125
What about a hamburger?

189
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:01,994
Have you ever cooked
a hamburger?

190
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:04,663
Baked a potato?

191
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:05,931
Uh-uh.

192
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:08,101
You never baked a potato?

193
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:10,702
It's not something I'm proud of.

194
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:12,905
You know, I couldn't cook either
till a couple months ago.

195
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:15,174
So your mom never taught you
how to cook anything?

196
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,175
My mother's dead.

197
00:17:20,646 --> 00:17:23,448
Sorry, I know that
that's like a standard joke

198
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:25,650
that people make,
but in my case, it's true.

199
00:17:25,683 --> 00:17:29,554
She's dead. She actually
died right in front of me.

200
00:17:29,588 --> 00:17:32,457
That's... My whole family,
in a restaurant.

201
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,626
She had a stroke.

202
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:37,896
God, I'm sorry.

203
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,703
Oh, my God, no, it's okay.

204
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:46,205
It's fine.

205
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,473
And that's actually not why
I don't know how to cook.

206
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:51,244
My dad is an excellent cook.

207
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:54,079
Yeah, it was
totally intentional.

208
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:56,648
I figured if, um,
I never learned how to cook,

209
00:17:56,682 --> 00:17:58,984
then I would
never become a housewife.

210
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:00,252
It's smart.

211
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:03,588
You think that's smart?

212
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:05,590
It's not that I don't think
that that's smart,

213
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:09,095
it's just, I'm so surprised
to hear him say that,

214
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:11,697
because he's really
into traditional gender roles.

215
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,101
You are.

216
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:16,868
Come on.

217
00:18:16,902 --> 00:18:19,637
You're always talking about
how fucked up feminism is.

218
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,773
Uh, what?!

219
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:23,775
No. That's a...

220
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:26,212
Okay, so now that you're
in front of a real feminist,

221
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:29,047
- you're gonna pretend...
- You're... She's oversimplifying.

222
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:32,118
- A lot.
- Hey, I think feminism is fucked up.

223
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:35,654
Yeah. Hairy armpits
on women, disgusting.

224
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:37,956
On men...

225
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:42,361
I'm kidding.

226
00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:49,768
Were you kidding
about your mom?

227
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:51,536
No.

228
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:54,539
You're really hard to read.

229
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:56,842
Yeah, you know what,
I get that all the time,

230
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,277
but I actually think that
I'm so easy to read

231
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:00,846
that people
just get confused

232
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,614
and they make it harder
on themselves.

233
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:04,683
You're just different

234
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:06,118
than I what I thought
you would be like

235
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:07,853
from watching your films.

236
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:10,689
You've seen my movies?

237
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:13,091
Yeah, we watched them
before you came.

238
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,693
Really?

239
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:20,266
Well, I'm so sorry.

240
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,000
Ah, you don't have
to be sorry.

241
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:24,336
I... I loved them.

242
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:26,172
Thank you.

243
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:30,876
A little more wine?

244
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:33,312
Are you gonna have more?

245
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:35,247
Um, okay. Sure.

246
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:40,585
I'll have some more.

247
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:45,724
What? The doctor said
I could have

248
00:19:45,757 --> 00:19:47,325
a few glasses of wine
every now and then.

249
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,161
She didn't say a few,
she said a couple.

250
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:51,130
Okay, this is my second.

251
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:54,032
This will be your third
that I know of.

252
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:56,135
And "once in a while"
isn't every night.

253
00:19:57,803 --> 00:20:00,939
I had one glass of wine
on Wednesday.

254
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:02,275
Yeah, that was
two days ago.

255
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:10,715
Okay, here.

256
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:13,018
You happy?
I just want you to remember

257
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:14,886
this night when the baby
comes out all fucked up.

258
00:20:18,957 --> 00:20:22,094
Hey, do you know
the foxtrot?

259
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:23,628
You said you were
a dancer, right?

260
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:28,667
Okay, so...

261
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,035
Okay.

262
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:32,405
- I guess I'll be the guy. Um...
- Okay.

263
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:35,273
You put your hand on my
collarbone like that.

264
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:37,275
And I'm gonna get
my hand here like this.

265
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,045
Okay.

266
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:41,813
And... you're gonna lead
with your right foot,

267
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:46,051
so you take two steps
and then a step to the side.

268
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:47,386
Okay.
Two steps.

269
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,889
So, right, left.

270
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:52,991
Side step.

271
00:20:53,024 --> 00:20:54,359
- Right.
- Right again.

272
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:55,894
- Left.
- Side.

273
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:57,696
Yes. You have...
Then you go back

274
00:20:57,729 --> 00:20:58,697
with your left foot.

275
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,165
- Left. Right.
- Right.

276
00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:01,867
Side step.

277
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:03,668
But make your steps small
because it's foxtrot.

278
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:05,270
- Sorry, I'm not...
- No, it's fine.

279
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:07,172
- Left. Left.
- Sorry. Left.

280
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:09,674
Right. Step.

281
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:14,046
There you go, right. Right. But you can
step forward, you're not gonna step on me.

282
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,115
- Okay, sorry.
- You're just stepping forward and back. And...

283
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:18,416
- I don't have good...
- Right.

284
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,119
I don't have the fundamentals.

285
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:24,289
Right. Left. Step. Step.

286
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:26,259
Right. Left.

287
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:29,428
- Side step.
- You have really good posture.

288
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:33,132
Forward. Well, yeah,
I danced my whole life.

289
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,433
And then back and...

290
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:36,801
Right. Side step.

291
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:38,971
You got it.
That's it.

292
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:40,239
Oh, okay. Heh.

293
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:42,474
I'm pretty sure
I don't got it.

294
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:45,211
Why don't you dance with Gabe?
He knows it.

295
00:21:55,086 --> 00:21:56,922
Gabe, dance
with Allison.

296
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:58,257
You're offending her.

297
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:01,894
No, you don't have to.

298
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:45,271
One, two.

299
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,933
- Well... Well...
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

300
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:16,369
If I can't get drunk,
at least let me enjoy watching you.

301
00:23:18,937 --> 00:23:21,806
You know, there's something I've
been really wanting to ask you.

302
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,575
Hm?

303
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:24,577
Do you find it weird,

304
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,379
acting in your own films?

305
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:30,482
Or... do you, like,

306
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:33,219
I don't know, get off
watching yourself or something?

307
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,288
Oh. No. Um...

308
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:38,157
No. I actually find it

309
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,258
kind of humiliating.

310
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,059
Oh.

311
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:43,161
And this, um,
film that you're writing,

312
00:23:43,194 --> 00:23:44,563
are you gonna act
in that?

313
00:23:47,032 --> 00:23:49,134
I'm not exactly writing yet.

314
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:51,103
Really? 'Cause you said earlier
that you were...

315
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,471
Blair.

316
00:23:52,505 --> 00:23:54,205
What?

317
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:56,975
I'm sorry, it's just so rare
to have the opportunity

318
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,577
to pick
a real artist's brain.

319
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:04,383
So, were you thinking
of setting it here?

320
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:05,984
Or did you
just come here to write?

321
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:08,487
Um, I mean,
when I saw the pictures online,

322
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:11,222
it was, it was so beautiful,
I just thought

323
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:13,525
coming here
might inspire me.

324
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:16,961
But, honestly, I don't know
if I'm gonna make another movie.

325
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:19,965
This has happened
to you before, right?

326
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:21,133
Writer's block?

327
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:24,969
Yeah, pretty much every time.

328
00:24:25,003 --> 00:24:27,106
So this is just your process.

329
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:30,275
Well, I wouldn't
really call it a process.

330
00:24:30,308 --> 00:24:33,012
It's more like
I'm just kind of

331
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:35,313
doing something
stupid with my day.

332
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:39,918
Waiting for something meaningful
to happen to me, heh.

333
00:24:41,152 --> 00:24:43,555
But you, you're doing
something meaningful.

334
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:45,890
Me? What am I doing?

335
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,560
You're building a family.

336
00:24:52,264 --> 00:24:54,399
I'm confused.
Didn't you just say

337
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:57,336
that you didn't learn how to cook because
you didn't want to become a housewife?

338
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,606
Lot's of women have families
that aren't housewives.

339
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:03,376
What you said before,
by the way, is bullshit.

340
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:06,878
That, that I'm into
traditional gender roles.

341
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:12,250
I think I'm into
traditional gender roles.

342
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:13,685
Yeah.

343
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:16,020
No, I really,
I mean that.

344
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:18,923
I don't know, I can't say
a part of me doesn't want

345
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:23,529
a man to just...
come along and take care of everything.

346
00:25:26,465 --> 00:25:30,402
Doesn't that kind of
contradict your entire life?

347
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:33,572
What about your films?

348
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:35,674
Don't you think
they're feminist?

349
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:40,011
I don't think about them
one way or the other.

350
00:25:40,044 --> 00:25:42,547
You don't think
about them?

351
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,950
How can you make something
if you never think about it?

352
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,053
Sometimes, when you're, you know,
making something, you're not conscious...

353
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:50,589
I'm talking to her.

354
00:25:53,158 --> 00:25:55,493
Yeah. No, no, no.
I think about it, but I don't,

355
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:58,196
it's not like I have any
really big ideas or anything,

356
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,433
when I'm making something.

357
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:04,102
How can you make something if
you don't have anything to say?

358
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:06,137
I have something to say.

359
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:09,007
I just think the movie
is the only way to say it.

360
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,979
Just seems
a little solipsistic to me.

361
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,549
Oh, I don't know
what that means.

362
00:26:16,582 --> 00:26:18,116
What does that mean?
That word?

363
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,687
Self-involved.

364
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,522
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, it is.

365
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:26,759
Blair likes everything
tied up

366
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:30,028
in nice little bows. Heh.

367
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:32,331
No, I...
I think I get it.

368
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:33,732
Right. Heh.

369
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:37,368
Just, like,
how you get that,

370
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:39,071
just because
I say something

371
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:42,207
about how abandoning
traditional gender roles

372
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,679
has destabilized society doesn't
mean I'm a male chauvinist.

373
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:48,747
Nobody said you were
a male chauvinist.

374
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:52,183
'Cause, you know, it's like,
for hundreds and hundreds of years,

375
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:55,253
the nuclear family meant
everything to people, right.

376
00:26:55,286 --> 00:26:57,223
Everybody had
their defined role.

377
00:26:57,256 --> 00:26:59,123
Now, that's broken down.

378
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:02,094
There's no real sense
of, uh, of family,

379
00:27:02,127 --> 00:27:05,431
- or community anymore.
- Communities that viewed women

380
00:27:05,464 --> 00:27:07,332
as private property.

381
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:09,502
Well, yeah, and from our modern
perspective, that may seem terrible.

382
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:11,336
No, it's objectively terrible.

383
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:12,771
Objectively?

384
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:16,675
I'm 6'1",
that's an objective fact.

385
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:18,476
Are you following this? Heh.

386
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,346
Okay, how can we know

387
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:22,080
women weren't happier

388
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:24,382
prior to
the industrial revolution?

389
00:27:24,415 --> 00:27:26,151
They definitely were not!

390
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:29,254
Fine! All I'm saying
is that the erosion

391
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:31,690
of traditional communities
is part of why things

392
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:33,559
are so chaotic right now, and...

393
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:35,528
Oh, that's why
everything's so chaotic.

394
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:37,630
Look, I'm not say...
I'm not saying that feminism is bad.

395
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:40,266
All I'm saying is that all
these things have disappeared...

396
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,267
you know, religious beliefs,
for example.

397
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,670
You know, delusional or not,
their disappearance

398
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:48,239
has created an absence
in the meaning of our lives.

399
00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:51,143
That's why all these things
that you don't like...

400
00:27:51,176 --> 00:27:53,445
uh, nationalism,
fundamentalism,

401
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:55,146
white supremacy
is on the rise.

402
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:56,815
Right? Globalism,
feminism,

403
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,518
- those things are...
- What's your point, Gabe?!

404
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,620
I'm-I'm-I'm saying
that nature

405
00:28:01,654 --> 00:28:03,622
is just gonna fucking do
what it do,

406
00:28:03,656 --> 00:28:05,791
you know, and the fucking earth
is gonna be consumed

407
00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:07,158
- by the sun...
- Fuck!

408
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:08,794
...and all this shit
like ideology,

409
00:28:08,827 --> 00:28:11,162
religion, consumerism,
you know, it's all

410
00:28:11,195 --> 00:28:13,097
just a bunch of bullshit
that people created

411
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:15,534
to distract ourselves
from the idea that

412
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,303
we live in a fucking
horrible shithole.

413
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:22,675
- Yes.
- It's a big shithole, meaningless fuckhole.

414
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,143
How is it helpful
to think that way, Gabe?

415
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:26,812
I'm not trying
to be helpful, Blair.

416
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:30,348
I'm just trying to tell you
the way it is.

417
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:33,252
It's like she can't stand the fact that
I have a single thought about this world.

418
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:34,820
No, it's not that
I can't stand

419
00:28:34,853 --> 00:28:36,521
that you have thoughts
about the world.

420
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:37,823
It's that I can't stand
the thoughts

421
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:40,392
about the world
that you have.

422
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:53,404
This has been so fun, but...

423
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,310
- Where are you going?
- I'm really tired.

424
00:28:58,344 --> 00:28:59,845
You've alienated our guest.

425
00:28:59,878 --> 00:29:02,314
No, no, no, no, it's okay.

426
00:29:02,348 --> 00:29:04,516
- Please, I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it's fine. It's fine. Thank you so much for dinner.

427
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,852
This conversation was
actually very fascinating.

428
00:29:06,885 --> 00:29:09,722
- Why don't you just...
- I wish I was recording that.

429
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:11,824
That was... Yes.

430
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:13,692
Can you just stay?

431
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:15,527
- I'm... I'm gonna go.
- Please, don't go.

432
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:17,529
- It's fine. Please.
- Please? We can change the subject.

433
00:29:17,563 --> 00:29:18,797
No, Blair, I don't want
to change the subject.

434
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:22,468
- Blair. Blair.
- Change the subject.

435
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,837
- I don't want to... I don't want to change the subject.
- We'll change the subject.

436
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,773
I want you to get it
through your thick fucking skull

437
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:30,809
that there is difference
between saying the upheaval

438
00:29:30,843 --> 00:29:33,846
in traditional gender roles
hasn't been great for society

439
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:35,279
and me being a male chauvinist.

440
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:37,415
No, you just want
to go back in time

441
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,818
to when women spent
their entire adult lives

442
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:41,453
pregnant and never left
the house,

443
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:43,957
so we could protect
your precious male insecurity.

444
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,258
You think women
should be slaves.

445
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,593
That's what you think.

446
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:50,229
You think women
should be fucking slaves.

447
00:29:52,598 --> 00:29:56,568
I-I mean, I do.
You know, bitches be crazy.

448
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:57,870
Shit.

449
00:29:57,903 --> 00:30:00,371
You know, fuck this.

450
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:02,474
No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

451
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:04,610
That was stupid.
I don't know why I said that.

452
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:06,244
I know why you said it.

453
00:30:06,277 --> 00:30:08,580
You said it because you're
uncomfortable with emotion.

454
00:30:08,614 --> 00:30:12,450
Anytime something real comes up,
you have to make a joke.

455
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:23,294
Okay, yeah, you're right.

456
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:28,333
No, she's right,
that-that is something I do.

457
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:32,604
Yeah, but I wasn't joking,
actually.

458
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:36,574
Yeah, I said I was joking
because it came out weird

459
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:39,778
and I got embarrassed,
but I think actually what I meant is,

460
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:42,480
um, not that I think
all women should be slaves,

461
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:44,383
but that maybe
I should be a slave.

462
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,952
Like, maybe I'd be better off being a slave.

463
00:30:46,985 --> 00:30:48,453
Or a prisoner, you know.

464
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:50,889
Or-or-or maybe I should
just get knocked up

465
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:53,257
and have a bunch of babies,
because maybe that would give me

466
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,561
some direction in my life,
because I'm fucking crazy,

467
00:30:55,594 --> 00:30:57,529
and I don't know
what to do with myself.

468
00:30:57,563 --> 00:30:58,997
Um, I don't know.

469
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,899
That's insane.

470
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:03,302
And it's deeply offensive.

471
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:07,806
Okay.

472
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,908
Are you joking right now?

473
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:13,445
- Is this a joke?
- I... I don't know.

474
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:15,581
I'm s...
I'm so high.

475
00:31:15,614 --> 00:31:18,016
I'm so stoned right now.
Please, tell her.

476
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,718
I just... I need...
I want to go to bed.

477
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,287
Blair, can you just calm...
Can you calm down a little bit?

478
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:24,388
Me? You're the one
who had a shit fit.

479
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:26,391
Hey. You're right.

480
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:30,863
I am very, very, very sorry.
It was totally insensitive.

481
00:31:30,896 --> 00:31:35,466
It was a dumb, callous,
ignorant thing to say, okay.

482
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:37,536
- I'm gonna go to bed...
- I'm gonna go to bed!

483
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:40,539
I'm the one who's going to bed! I'm going to bed. You stay up.

484
00:31:40,572 --> 00:31:43,375
Have your weird
fucking anti-progressive

485
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:44,877
conversation in peace.

486
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,378
Good night.

487
00:31:58,757 --> 00:32:00,458
Um...

488
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:02,661
- help yourself to anything you like.
- Yeah.

489
00:32:02,694 --> 00:32:06,098
- I'm really sorry.
- And, uh...

490
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:07,599
Yeah.

491
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,676
Oh, my God.

492
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,946
Blair, really?
What are you doing?

493
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:23,615
You don't love me anymore.

494
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:26,518
And I'm fucking pregnant with your fucking baby!

495
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:28,887
Are we really
doing this right now?

496
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:31,356
I saw the way
that you were looking at her!

497
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,759
You think she's
more interesting than me

498
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,895
because she agrees with
all your dumb, horrible ideas!

499
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:40,699
Blair, I think that you've had
a little bit too much to drink, okay,

500
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:42,835
and your body is...

501
00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:45,003
- You're in love with her. You are, I know it.
- ...and I've been drinking too.

502
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:46,705
Ah... Who? Who? Allison?

503
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:48,740
I-I-I'm not even sure
if I like her.

504
00:32:48,774 --> 00:32:51,009
If you think
you're in love with her,

505
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:52,978
can you just tell me
so I don't feel like

506
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:54,746
I'm going fucking crazy?!

507
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,516
Blair, do you hear the words
that you are saying right now?

508
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:59,051
You love her!
You love her!

509
00:32:59,084 --> 00:33:00,719
- And she is bad.
- Shh!

510
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:02,821
- Oh yeah, she is fucking bad!
- Shh! Why? What did...?

511
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,991
- What did she do? I'm...
- Are you defending her?

512
00:33:06,024 --> 00:33:07,826
I can't believe
you're defending her.

513
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,529
Baby, I barely know
the girl. I don't...

514
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:12,731
You attracted to her?

515
00:33:12,764 --> 00:33:14,499
- I...
- Huh?

516
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:17,102
- I knew it! I knew it!
- Oh, my God!

517
00:33:17,135 --> 00:33:20,772
- I knew it.
- I'm... I'm not attracted to her.

518
00:33:20,806 --> 00:33:23,075
Yeah, well, why didn't
you just say that then?

519
00:33:23,108 --> 00:33:26,778
Because... she's attractive,
so I thought

520
00:33:26,812 --> 00:33:29,715
that you wouldn't believe me
if I said that she wasn't.

521
00:33:29,748 --> 00:33:32,784
You know what...?
No, no, I don't care.

522
00:33:32,818 --> 00:33:35,621
I don't care.
You... Just go and fuck her.

523
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:37,456
- Go and fuck her.
- Hey...

524
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:40,192
- If that's what you want to do, I don't care.
- Just calm...

525
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:42,493
- You just go and fuck her!
- ...down.

526
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:45,898
- I bet her pussy smells like fucking spider shit!
- Calm... down. Shh!

527
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:47,699
What are you saying?

528
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:49,868
This isn't about me,
you know that?

529
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,737
I said I was very clear

530
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,172
that this is about the fact
that you don't love me anymore.

531
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:56,075
Stop. I love you.

532
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:58,677
I-I wouldn't...
I wouldn't be here

533
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,780
if I, if I didn't love...
Oh, my God, I wouldn't have done this

534
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:03,749
if I didn't love you.

535
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:12,490
I wouldn't... I wouldn't have
been through all these moments

536
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:16,128
like this all the time
if I didn't love you.

537
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,696
Hey. I love you.

538
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,532
Blair.

539
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:24,069
So, so, so much.

540
00:34:29,608 --> 00:34:31,043
Please.

541
00:34:32,078 --> 00:34:33,812
Can we stop now?

542
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:35,147
This is insane.

543
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,949
This is brutally insane.

544
00:34:37,984 --> 00:34:39,451
It's over.

545
00:34:41,553 --> 00:34:44,223
Maybe women were
happier in the 1700s.

546
00:34:44,257 --> 00:34:45,490
What do I know?

547
00:34:47,826 --> 00:34:50,096
No. No,
they definitely weren't.

548
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,764
I'm sorry, I was being
such a fuckin' dickhead.

549
00:34:52,798 --> 00:34:53,932
Yeah.

550
00:35:00,806 --> 00:35:02,607
Oh, my God.

551
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:47,706
Hey.

552
00:37:50,876 --> 00:37:51,877
Brought this.

553
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,278
It's a little chilly, so...

554
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:06,391
Okay. Good night.

555
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,368
It's warm.

556
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,442
Yee! Heh.

557
00:38:30,448 --> 00:38:32,318
Oh!

558
00:38:57,443 --> 00:38:59,110
So, are you guys Buddhist?

559
00:38:59,144 --> 00:39:02,847
Oh. No, the sculptor
who stayed here makes them.

560
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:05,717
Hm.

561
00:39:17,062 --> 00:39:19,432
Allison, I'm sorry
about before.

562
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:21,900
We're kind of
in our own little world up here,

563
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:24,169
and... yeah, anyway.

564
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:26,339
I'm sorry.

565
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:29,274
- It's okay.
- Heh.

566
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:30,741
Okay.

567
00:40:00,238 --> 00:40:03,309
Why'd you lie to me
about seeing my movies?

568
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,046
Why'd you lie to me
about your husband?

569
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:12,350
I've been lying since
the second I got here.

570
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:15,454
My mother's fine.

571
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:19,025
Well, she's a bitch,
but she's alive.

572
00:40:19,058 --> 00:40:20,459
She's in Wisconsin.

573
00:40:21,394 --> 00:40:23,561
What...?

574
00:40:23,596 --> 00:40:25,197
I'm a really good cook.

575
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:28,434
Um, I just have zero interest
in having a family.

576
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,835
I think children
are disgusting.

577
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:36,141
And as for my scripts,

578
00:40:36,174 --> 00:40:39,245
I usually start with like
a really simple premise,

579
00:40:39,278 --> 00:40:43,982
like... "Good triumphs
over evil",

580
00:40:44,016 --> 00:40:46,985
and, um...

581
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:48,887
I stopped getting hired
as an actor

582
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:50,256
because I was difficult.

583
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:51,524
Obviously.

584
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:55,594
- Yeah.
- And... what else?

585
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:57,929
I know exactly
what solipsistic means.

586
00:40:57,962 --> 00:41:00,231
Um, I went to Wesleyan
on a scholarship.

587
00:41:00,265 --> 00:41:02,635
I'm a total feminist.
I am.

588
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,103
I think women
are totally superior

589
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:07,139
and all men should die.

590
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,973
So...

591
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,415
Why didn't your husband
come with you?

592
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:28,461
I don't know.

593
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:33,164
I'm glad he didn't.

594
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:07,600
Oh, fuck.

595
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:12,337
Mm.

596
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:28,554
I'm not in love
with her, okay?

597
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:32,658
It was an accident, the...

598
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:34,292
the baby, and...

599
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:36,194
we're not right
for each other.

600
00:42:39,398 --> 00:42:40,666
I mean, she thinks
she loves me,

601
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:42,300
but she actually hates me.

602
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:47,405
I know this is a human being
coming into the world,

603
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,075
and I don't know...

604
00:42:55,714 --> 00:42:57,516
...what's gonna happen,

605
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,685
what's gonna happen
to me, or...

606
00:43:05,423 --> 00:43:07,493
You think
I'm a terrible person?

607
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:09,562
No.

608
00:43:09,595 --> 00:43:12,397
- I am.
- Mm.

609
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,699
Don't say that.

610
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:17,302
- I am.
- No, you're not.

611
00:44:02,147 --> 00:44:04,215
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

612
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,120
I knew it!
I fucking knew it!

613
00:44:08,153 --> 00:44:11,289
You fucking asshole!
I fucking knew it!

614
00:44:11,322 --> 00:44:12,826
You said you...
You fucking homewrecker!

615
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:15,661
Get the fuck out of my house,
you bitch!

616
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,429
You bitch,
get the fuck out of here!

617
00:44:18,463 --> 00:44:20,332
I can't believe you did this!

618
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,333
Get back,
you fucking liar!

619
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:24,402
- Just listen to me... Stop!
- You still fucked up!

620
00:44:24,435 --> 00:44:25,804
Blair! Stop!

621
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:28,206
Ow! Ow!

622
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:30,241
What? What?

623
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:32,444
- Tell me.
- Oh, my God.

624
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:34,680
- What? What-what? What? What?
- Oh, my God...

625
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,548
What? Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

626
00:44:36,581 --> 00:44:38,551
- Ah! Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

627
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:40,418
Hey. Hey, she's bleeding!
Go get the keys!

628
00:44:40,452 --> 00:44:42,620
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, babe, we're gonna go to the hospital.

629
00:44:42,654 --> 00:44:46,124
Okay? Go get the keys to
the truck! By the front door!

630
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:48,493
She's bleeding! Look at me,
we're gonna go to the hospital, okay.

631
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:11,784
I'm so sorry.

632
00:45:11,817 --> 00:45:13,519
- Don't fucking touch me!
- What are you doing?!

633
00:45:13,552 --> 00:45:16,387
Get the car!
Go get the car!

634
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,629
- It hurts.
- Okay...

635
00:45:26,665 --> 00:45:28,166
Okay...

636
00:45:29,835 --> 00:45:31,837
I'm scared...

637
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,305
I'm scared.

638
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:37,876
Just breathe.

639
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:41,780
Drive!

640
00:45:41,814 --> 00:45:44,483
Oh, my God.
I love you so much.

641
00:45:44,516 --> 00:45:46,250
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

642
00:45:46,284 --> 00:45:47,552
I'm sorry, all right?

643
00:45:47,585 --> 00:45:49,622
I did it for whatever.
I'm so sorry.

644
00:45:50,923 --> 00:45:52,858
Don't look at me! Oh!

645
00:47:28,787 --> 00:47:30,455
What's going on?

646
00:47:30,488 --> 00:47:31,824
They cut?

647
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:34,693
I don't know.

648
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:49,508
<i>Gotta go again.</i>

649
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:54,713
<i>Back to one.</i>

650
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,322
Hey! Was that bad?

651
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:05,724
What did I do wrong?

652
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:09,895
<i>On the spot.
Everything was great.</i>

653
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:12,564
Okay...

654
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:16,869
So why are we going again
if it was great?

655
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:23,608
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

656
00:48:23,641 --> 00:48:25,377
<i>It was amazing, okay.</i>

657
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,312
<i>It was... That was the best
silent walk to the cabin</i>

658
00:48:28,346 --> 00:48:30,582
<i>I've ever seen.
Really.</i>

659
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,518
Okay, if it was amazing,

660
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:34,318
then why don't we call
for dinner

661
00:48:34,352 --> 00:48:36,755
and get to the next scene
earlier so we have more time?

662
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,491
It's more important.

663
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:40,926
<i>Can you...?</i>

664
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,063
<i>I'm coming to you.</i>

665
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,856
Can I get off?

666
00:49:10,889 --> 00:49:12,057
Can I go?

667
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,075
What the fuck
is going on?

668
00:49:30,108 --> 00:49:31,643
Nothing is going on.

669
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,545
I don't understand
what's going on with you.

670
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:35,580
I've been doing,
like, 15 takes every time,

671
00:49:35,613 --> 00:49:37,749
every scene and you're
only asking Blair to do three.

672
00:49:37,783 --> 00:49:40,819
- Are you counting takes?
- I don't have to count takes. I'm in the scenes.

673
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,120
We're losing light,
you know that?

674
00:49:42,154 --> 00:49:44,056
And we're losing time.

675
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:45,557
We are.

676
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,394
Why are you crying? Why?

677
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:51,096
I'm... I'm sorry.

678
00:49:51,129 --> 00:49:53,165
I do less takes with Blair,
because when I tell her

679
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,767
to do something,
she actually does it.

680
00:49:56,902 --> 00:49:58,170
Yeah?

681
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,805
Is that good enough
for you?

682
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:01,506
I just wanted
to do one more.

683
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,008
So do the take,
don't do the take.

684
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,010
I really... I don't...
I don't give a shit.

685
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,680
Okay, 'cause it's your fucking
face that's gonna be on camera!

686
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:36,475
Yeah? You good to go?

687
00:50:37,943 --> 00:50:40,545
<i>All right, everybody,
last looks.</i>

688
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:42,949
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

689
00:50:42,982 --> 00:50:44,016
Are you sure?

690
00:50:44,049 --> 00:50:46,618
Want a tissue, Allison?
Water?

691
00:50:46,652 --> 00:50:47,853
I'm okay.

692
00:50:47,886 --> 00:50:49,488
You look beautiful.

693
00:50:59,031 --> 00:51:01,100
<i>Resetting to first position.</i>

694
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,176
Picture's up!

695
00:51:45,677 --> 00:51:47,112
I'm sorry, y'all,
the tilapia,

696
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,216
the tilapia we had for lunch
did not agree with me.

697
00:51:58,023 --> 00:52:00,158
Okay. Roll sound!

698
00:52:02,027 --> 00:52:03,795
Sound speed!

699
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,563
Marker.

700
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,568
Oh, my God.

701
00:52:09,601 --> 00:52:11,970
You need to watch this take
'cause it's gonna be incredible.

702
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:13,572
Look.

703
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:19,544
Oh, my God.

704
00:52:20,912 --> 00:52:21,847
Is that a tear?

705
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,815
Yeah.

706
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,284
Now I'm wondering
what kind of mind games

707
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:26,651
you're playing with me.

708
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,286
No, I don't have to.

709
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,822
Okay, so I think
we should stay in here, right,

710
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:33,225
for like another 15, 20 minutes,

711
00:52:33,258 --> 00:52:34,659
let her start eating,

712
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,261
notice we're
the only ones not there,

713
00:52:36,294 --> 00:52:38,630
and then you should go in
like two minutes before me,

714
00:52:38,663 --> 00:52:41,767
that way it looks like we were together and
then deliberately spaced out our entrances

715
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,336
to give the impression
we weren't together.

716
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,237
- Right? That's amazing.
- I can't.

717
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,105
What? Act like
you're in love with me?

718
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:49,242
No, I can act like
I'm in love with you.

719
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:51,777
- Right, and why, because you're a professional?
- No, because you're adorable.

720
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:55,614
You are, you're adorable in a
neurotic, petulant sort of way.

721
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,316
Okay, I don't like
compliments.

722
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,987
- Can we just get back to the plan?
- I can't. I can't.

723
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,888
What? It's what you do
for a living.

724
00:53:02,921 --> 00:53:05,090
You don't think she knows
what I'm up to?

725
00:53:05,123 --> 00:53:06,291
She knows it's helping her.

726
00:53:06,325 --> 00:53:08,194
Trust me, we've been married
for six years.

727
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,128
I know, it's just,
I'm getting this vibe from her

728
00:53:10,162 --> 00:53:12,631
that feels really real, like
she's actually gonna kill me.

729
00:53:12,664 --> 00:53:14,833
And don't you see how good
that is for the last scene?

730
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:18,070
It's fine.
Oh, God, actually,

731
00:53:18,103 --> 00:53:20,306
you should go in
like five minutes before me.

732
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:22,908
We need to make it look like we were
fucking and now we're trying to hide it.

733
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:24,776
- But we're doing a bad job.
- Exactly.

734
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,245
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- What? Shut up. Stop.

735
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:29,247
Okay, so will you go in first
or am I going in first, or...?

736
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:31,017
- Uh, I'll go in first.
- Okay.

737
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,884
No, you go in first, that way,
if she tries to kill me

738
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,020
- you'll protect me.
- She's not gonna try to kill you.

739
00:53:35,053 --> 00:53:37,223
- Fine, I'll go in first.
- Okay, you go in first.

740
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,091
I'll come in, what,
a couple minutes after you?

741
00:53:39,124 --> 00:53:41,093
Then... Oh! yeah, you should
just sit somewhere

742
00:53:41,126 --> 00:53:43,296
where there's an empty seat
next to you or across from you.

743
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:45,897
I'm gonna come in,
I'll sit by you,

744
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,900
whatever I say, just giggle
or smile or whatever.

745
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,002
You... you think we should
sit near each other?

746
00:53:51,036 --> 00:53:52,771
- Yeah.
- I think we should sit

747
00:53:52,804 --> 00:53:54,407
as far away from each other
as possible,

748
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,409
but we keep looking
at each other from afar.

749
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:57,976
Oh, yes!

750
00:53:58,009 --> 00:53:59,845
Like these quick
little glances?

751
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:01,414
Like we're trying
not to look at each other,

752
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,181
but we can't help it.

753
00:54:03,215 --> 00:54:05,350
Oh, and we can also like play
with our food and not eat it

754
00:54:05,383 --> 00:54:08,053
'cause we, you know, we have no
appetite, 'cause we're nervous,

755
00:54:08,086 --> 00:54:09,754
we're in love, and you know.

756
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,655
I don't know,
I'm actually kinda hungry.

757
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:12,824
Me too.

758
00:54:12,858 --> 00:54:14,693
Uh, skip that part.

759
00:54:14,726 --> 00:54:17,062
Oh, my God, this scene's
gonna be so good tonight.

760
00:54:18,998 --> 00:54:20,899
Oh, shit, she's gonna
see us looking.

761
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,841
Maybe we should mess up
each other's hair.

762
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,878
You're a genius.

763
00:54:37,416 --> 00:54:38,950
That's too much.

764
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,219
- That's good.
- Okay.

765
00:54:54,267 --> 00:54:56,868
Sorry. Uh...

766
00:54:56,902 --> 00:54:58,703
- There you go.
- Oh, thanks.

767
00:54:58,737 --> 00:55:01,307
Okay, uh,
what do you call a bear with no teeth?

768
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,175
- Gummy Bear.
- Gummy Bear.

769
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:04,709
- What...? How did...?
- How did you...?

770
00:55:04,743 --> 00:55:05,977
How do you know all these...?

771
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,480
Don't ruin the surprise
of the whole thing.

772
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:09,748
You just read
the same book as me.

773
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:11,383
It doesn't mean that you...

774
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:17,055
Okay, um, uh, what is
a bear cub's favorite porno mag?

775
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:19,292
- <i>Barely Legal.</i>
- <i>Barely Legal.</i> That's...

776
00:55:19,325 --> 00:55:21,726
- <i>Barely Legal,</i> baby.
- That was off the page.

777
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,064
So, why was the little bear
so spoiled?

778
00:55:25,097 --> 00:55:26,731
Baako, have you seen this bear?

779
00:55:26,765 --> 00:55:28,500
- What?
- Bear.

780
00:55:34,439 --> 00:55:36,741
The jokes are
pretty easy to memorize.

781
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,813
It's like a mutual respect
for everything.

782
00:56:07,006 --> 00:56:10,008
The, uh, last take
was really good.

783
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:52,450
You're amazing.

784
00:57:13,339 --> 00:57:15,474
- Don't really want any in here.
- Oh, yeah? Is it too much?

785
00:57:15,508 --> 00:57:18,144
- It just gets a little build up, you know?
- Totally.

786
00:57:18,177 --> 00:57:20,078
I think it looks great though.
I mean, do you like it?

787
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:22,314
- Mm-hm.
- I'm glad we switched to this new foundation.

788
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:23,948
I'm sorry we found it
on the last day.

789
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,117
- But you happy?
- Yeah, I feel good.

790
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,553
- Okay. Get your coffee.
- Yeah, thank you.

791
00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:32,090
All right, let's get dressed.

792
00:57:32,123 --> 00:57:33,158
Mm-hm.

793
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:34,859
Oh! Shit!

794
00:57:34,893 --> 00:57:37,463
Oh, my God, the coffee
on this show is so fucking hot.

795
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,164
I'm sorry,
but that is

796
00:57:39,197 --> 00:57:41,099
the most attractive man
on set, hands down.

797
00:57:41,132 --> 00:57:42,601
- Right?
- Right.

798
00:57:42,635 --> 00:57:44,236
What? No. Baako!

799
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,104
What? Listen, uh,

800
00:57:46,137 --> 00:57:48,407
we're splitting hairs here,
'cause they both sit on my face.

801
00:57:48,441 --> 00:57:51,976
Yes,
we should do it in this order.

802
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,345
Third and the first...

803
00:57:53,378 --> 00:57:55,281
I think
you need to focus on Mike,

804
00:57:55,314 --> 00:57:58,083
because he's focusing on you.

805
00:57:58,116 --> 00:58:00,952
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

806
00:58:00,985 --> 00:58:03,221
Wait a minute, you're telling me
you got a thing going on with Baako?

807
00:58:03,254 --> 00:58:05,557
I'm not saying I
have a thing going on with him,

808
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,959
I'm just saying, I don't know.

809
00:58:07,992 --> 00:58:10,228
Anyway, I think Mike
might be more into you.

810
00:58:10,261 --> 00:58:12,030
No, that's
not happening, he's straight.

811
00:58:12,064 --> 00:58:13,299
I don't think he's straight.

812
00:58:13,332 --> 00:58:14,500
Yes, he is. His face is.

813
00:58:16,134 --> 00:58:18,137
I think he's gay.

814
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,473
Okay, thank you for telling
the gay person who's gay to them.

815
00:58:20,506 --> 00:58:23,341
Makeup's ready if anyone
has eyes on Allison.

816
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:27,278
All right, so...
It's over here, hon.

817
00:58:27,312 --> 00:58:29,481
Okay, so...
What is he going with?

818
00:58:29,514 --> 00:58:31,117
Is he going with the blue
or the pink?

819
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,151
- Definitely the pink.
- All right, there we go.

820
00:58:33,184 --> 00:58:34,620
- And we're doing it.
- Beautiful.

821
00:58:34,653 --> 00:58:36,155
- Can you take this?
- Mm-hm.

822
00:58:36,188 --> 00:58:38,290
Thank you. Hm.

823
00:58:38,324 --> 00:58:39,958
No one's answering me.

824
00:58:39,991 --> 00:58:42,495
Oh, my God. Cahya, uh,
did you see Allison anywhere?

825
00:58:42,528 --> 00:58:45,330
She's not here?
Oh, God.

826
00:58:45,363 --> 00:58:47,298
Has anybody got eyes
on Allison?

827
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:52,705
- They won't answer me either.
- Does anybody copy me?

828
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:56,040
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'll go
get her, don't worry about it.

829
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,576
- Okay, well, we're waiting.
- I got it.

830
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,444
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

831
00:58:59,477 --> 00:59:01,080
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry.

832
00:59:01,113 --> 00:59:02,248
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God.

833
00:59:02,281 --> 00:59:03,416
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

834
00:59:03,449 --> 00:59:05,083
I'm sorry,
I'm really sorry.

835
00:59:05,116 --> 00:59:07,720
Everything is fine. That's
why we have doubles, okay?

836
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,622
- Ouch.
- Are you okay?

837
00:59:09,655 --> 00:59:11,356
- Here we go.
- I'm so sorry, I'll get you another...

838
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:13,159
- Uh, I can get it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

839
00:59:13,192 --> 00:59:15,059
- Cream, right?
- I don't do dairy.

840
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,562
- She doesn't do dairy.
- Oh.

841
00:59:26,472 --> 00:59:30,342
Guys, do either of you
have eyes on Allison?

842
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:35,981
Oh, my God, are you guys
stoned right now?

843
00:59:36,015 --> 00:59:38,950
Oh, my God. Babe, can you find
Allison for me, please?

844
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:40,952
Please.

845
00:59:43,689 --> 00:59:46,024
You know you're wasting
your time, right?

846
00:59:53,364 --> 00:59:54,999
That-that thing
that you guys suck on,

847
00:59:55,034 --> 00:59:57,235
is it good
for an upset stomach?

848
00:59:57,268 --> 00:59:59,037
Is it...? It's mellow?

849
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,373
- Lay off the coffee.
- It's mellow, no?

850
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,254
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

851
01:00:16,287 --> 01:00:18,023
- Oh shit, oh shit. Holy shit.
- Ow.

852
01:00:18,057 --> 01:00:19,758
I'm... I'm so sorry.

853
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:21,427
I am so sorry.

854
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:39,778
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

855
01:00:39,812 --> 01:00:43,582
Okay, I guess
we're going with the blue.

856
01:00:43,616 --> 01:00:46,017
All right.
Are you okay, honey?

857
01:00:47,552 --> 01:00:49,221
- I guess.
- All right.

858
01:00:49,255 --> 01:00:51,457
You know what, just, yeah,
I'm just gonna take the coffee.

859
01:00:53,324 --> 01:00:54,827
It wasn't my fault then.

860
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,262
What did...?

861
01:01:02,334 --> 01:01:04,202
Joe, what were you thinking?

862
01:01:04,235 --> 01:01:06,071
- Oh, 20.
- Minutes?

863
01:01:06,105 --> 01:01:07,540
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

864
01:01:07,573 --> 01:01:09,340
- Cahya? Cahya?
- Lord have mercy, please.

865
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,242
- Cahya, what's the ETA on Allison?
- We're working on it.

866
01:01:11,276 --> 01:01:13,746
- She's not down there?
- We're working on it. I'm sorry.

867
01:01:16,682 --> 01:01:18,584
<i>Nora for Cahya.</i>

868
01:01:19,518 --> 01:01:20,819

<i>Uh, some cabin?</i>

874
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:30,796
Got it. Flying in.

01:01:33,431 --> 01:01:35,366
Jesus, Caroline,

876

Um, Allison, <i>mamita.</i>

Why'd you stop?

883
01:02:07,466 --> 01:02:09,367
Allison, I need you
to look at me.

884
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,905
'Cause I have to go to set now.

885
01:02:11,938 --> 01:02:14,373
Uh-oh. You.

- It's okay.

You're amazing.
It's okay.

889

Um, so can you
sit up for me?

890
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,652
Yeah, we're gonna
finish the film.

891
01:02:26,685 --> 01:02:29,587
Um, okay, so can you sit up
for me for a second?

892
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,759
- Okay.
- Okay.

893
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:36,428
That was... That was...
Can you...? Is...?

894
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:38,464
Can you stand up
for me now?

895
01:02:38,497 --> 01:02:39,765
You're so pretty.

896
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,235
You should be
in the movie.

897
01:02:43,268 --> 01:02:45,236
You should be
in the movie, not me.

898
01:02:45,269 --> 01:02:46,504
I'm tired.

899
01:02:46,537 --> 01:02:47,772
Okay, let's,
let's stand up now.

900
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:50,442
- I'm tired. I'm tired.
- Okay.

901
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:52,745
No, no, no, just...
We're just gonna get dressed now.

902
01:02:52,778 --> 01:02:55,581
- You should be in the movie. God, I'm tired, I'm tired.
- No, I'm not an actress.

903
01:02:55,614 --> 01:02:57,348
No, no, no, no.
Okay.

904
01:02:57,382 --> 01:02:59,953
Um, okay.

905
01:02:59,986 --> 01:03:01,553
Can... Can you
sit up for me?

906
01:03:01,587 --> 01:03:03,354
- I'm tired.
- Don't...

907
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:04,957
Can you sit up for me
by any chance?

908
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,825
You sure you want
to be doing that?

909
01:03:10,361 --> 01:03:12,898
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>
Eh-he.

01:03:12,931 --> 01:03:14,566
- Oh...
- Hey...

911
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,234
- Sorry.
- Okay.

912

Oh, Lord have mercy.

913
01:03:17,735 --> 01:03:20,272
- I'm up.
- Okay, um...

914
01:03:20,305 --> 01:03:23,809
Can you get dressed now?
Or get w... Yeah.

915
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:25,744
What's the matter
with this?

916
01:03:25,778 --> 01:03:27,913
It's... It hasn't been established
like that, so, you know...

917
01:03:27,946 --> 01:03:31,617
So you're just gonna go and we're
gonna shoot this last scene.

918
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,519
He's punishing me.

919
01:03:33,552 --> 01:03:35,889
You understand
what I'm saying to you?

920
01:03:35,922 --> 01:03:37,823
Cahya, he's punishing me.

921
01:03:45,898 --> 01:03:47,699
First A.D.
coming to set.

922
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,671
Did you hear that?
Do you think it was a bear?

923
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:55,741
What bear? There's a bear?
How come nobody tells me anything.

924
01:03:55,774 --> 01:03:57,943
Okay, Allison, start walking
a little faster now.

925
01:03:57,976 --> 01:04:00,412
- Jesus Christ.
- Are you okay?

926
01:04:00,446 --> 01:04:01,880
No, I'm not okay,
obviously.

927
01:04:01,914 --> 01:04:03,414
And that shit
was not mellow.

928
01:04:03,448 --> 01:04:05,316
Simone. The vape.
Or whatever.

929
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:06,719
You're stoned too?

930
01:04:06,752 --> 01:04:08,754
Why the fuck you smokin'
with that bitch anyway?

931
01:04:08,787 --> 01:04:10,823
I'm not jealous.

932
01:04:10,856 --> 01:04:12,825
I'm just saying,
that shit was not mellow.

933
01:04:12,858 --> 01:04:14,258
- You thought it was mellow?
- No.

934
01:04:14,293 --> 01:04:15,594
I'm totally
freaking out.

935
01:04:15,627 --> 01:04:17,428
I'm totally stoned.

936
01:04:19,765 --> 01:04:21,834
Where are you going?!

937
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:23,937
Okay. All right,
let's go.

938
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,338
Let's go.
Really, let's...

939
01:04:27,806 --> 01:04:29,909
Oh, yeah. No, I like that.

940
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,349
We should probably light it.

941
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:53,498
Um, hey, Baako...

942
01:04:53,531 --> 01:04:54,900
we have to go handheld.

943
01:04:57,002 --> 01:04:58,336
Just do it.

944
01:04:59,037 --> 01:05:01,406
Let's get rid of this track.

945
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,810
I have the ability
to be an actor.

946
01:05:04,843 --> 01:05:06,879
I just choose not to
because I care about my craft.

947
01:05:06,912 --> 01:05:08,914
- No test, bitch.
- Hey. Ooh.

948
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,849
Hey, bud.

949
01:05:10,883 --> 01:05:12,718
Help me.

950
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:13,952
Okay.

951
01:05:13,986 --> 01:05:15,053
Stop!

952
01:05:15,087 --> 01:05:16,454
Oh! Ho-ho!

953
01:05:16,487 --> 01:05:17,957
Heh. You got me.

954
01:05:17,991 --> 01:05:20,859
All right, let's have a seat, huh?

955
01:05:27,933 --> 01:05:30,335
The shit was not mellow,
and now I'm just fucking stoned,

956
01:05:30,369 --> 01:05:31,570
and I have diarrhea.

957
01:05:31,603 --> 01:05:33,471
You asked for it.

958
01:05:33,505 --> 01:05:35,506
Yeah, well, you should have fucking
said that it's not fucking mellow.

959
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:36,875
I wouldn't describe it as that.

960
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,581
- Cahya?
- Yes, sir?

961
01:05:42,614 --> 01:05:44,449
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

962
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:46,651
I, um, just have
explosive diarrhea.

963
01:05:46,685 --> 01:05:48,954
- Oh.
- And I think it was the tilapia we had for lunch.

964
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,689
There was something
a little off with it.

965
01:05:50,722 --> 01:05:52,423
Okay. I had tilapia,
I'm fine.

966
01:05:52,456 --> 01:05:54,459
- You should get some Pepto.
- Somebody got Pepto?

967
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:56,495
I don't know,
Simone gave me some the other day.

968
01:05:56,528 --> 01:05:58,030
Hey, what's the ETA
on Allison?

969
01:05:58,063 --> 01:06:00,532
Cahya for Maude.
ETA on Allison?

970
01:06:00,566 --> 01:06:02,434
What's left?

971
01:06:02,467 --> 01:06:05,469
Whoo-hoo...

972
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,940
Oh. Oh.

973
01:06:11,911 --> 01:06:13,712
You had Pepto all this time?

974
01:06:13,745 --> 01:06:15,714
Hey, thanks for joining us.

975
01:06:15,747 --> 01:06:18,251
So, your first position's
here on this chair.

976
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,090
Do you want to give that
to Maude?

977
01:06:30,063 --> 01:06:33,065
- Allison...
- Hey, did you find that pepperoni?

978
01:06:37,903 --> 01:06:39,504
Allison...

979
01:06:40,839 --> 01:06:42,941
Can I talk to you outside?

980
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:47,511
Outside. Let's go outside.

981
01:06:55,587 --> 01:06:56,955
Do I need to remind you

982
01:06:56,989 --> 01:06:59,892
that all of our money
is wrapped up in this movie?

983
01:06:59,926 --> 01:07:02,561
Now, I do not know
what you think you are doing,

984
01:07:02,594 --> 01:07:05,597
okay, but whatever is going on
between me and you,

985
01:07:05,631 --> 01:07:07,099
we can talk about it
tomorrow,

986
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:09,868
because if we do not
get through this scene tonight...

987
01:07:09,902 --> 01:07:11,169
Look at me...

988
01:07:11,203 --> 01:07:13,805
I promise you,
you are going to regret it.

989
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:15,439
Do you understand?

990
01:07:16,742 --> 01:07:17,911
Okay.

991
01:07:20,712 --> 01:07:24,050
Um, okay, guys. So, um,
so we're just gonna take it

992
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,652
through, "So there is
something to talk about."

993
01:07:26,685 --> 01:07:29,087
Okay, and then,
we're just gonna do a quick reset.

994
01:07:29,121 --> 01:07:30,822
Mike will step between you,

995
01:07:30,856 --> 01:07:34,192
and Blair, you'll
just make your exit.

996
01:07:34,226 --> 01:07:36,662
And that's it, and we're
done, and we're out of that.

997
01:07:36,695 --> 01:07:37,996
Okay?

998
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,464
Allison?

999
01:07:42,701 --> 01:07:44,136
Allison?

1000
01:07:44,169 --> 01:07:45,604
I heard you.

1001
01:07:45,637 --> 01:07:46,872
Okay, great.

1002
01:07:46,905 --> 01:07:48,107
We good to go?

1003
01:07:48,141 --> 01:07:49,808
Yes, sir.

1004
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:00,686
Great.

1005
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:02,487
Okay...

1006
01:08:02,521 --> 01:08:03,822
Where's my monitor?

1007
01:08:05,157 --> 01:08:06,792
Okay, are we good?

1008
01:08:07,826 --> 01:08:09,528
Why is this...? Okay.

1009
01:08:09,561 --> 01:08:10,829
You ready?

1010
01:08:11,897 --> 01:08:13,166
Roll sound.

1011
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,968
Wait, who's coverage is this?

1012
01:08:16,001 --> 01:08:17,501
There's no coverage.

1013
01:08:17,536 --> 01:08:19,138
It's... It's roaming.
It's documentary style.

1014
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:21,139
What about the dolly shot?

1015
01:08:21,173 --> 01:08:23,275
Well, we don't have time
to do it now.

1016
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:24,910
So I'd appreciate it

1017
01:08:24,943 --> 01:08:26,178
if you stop asking questions,

1018
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:28,280
and just please play the scene.

1019
01:08:30,849 --> 01:08:32,050
Okay, call it.

1020
01:08:32,084 --> 01:08:34,152
Roll sound.

1021
01:08:34,186 --> 01:08:35,955
Sound speed.

1022
01:08:35,989 --> 01:08:37,622
Scene 87 Romeo.

1023
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:39,291
Take 1. Mark.

1024
01:08:43,028 --> 01:08:45,297
Camera set.

1025
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,034
Baako,
tilt down just a little bit. Yeah.

1026
01:08:48,067 --> 01:08:50,102
Okay, whenever you're ready.

1027
01:09:20,132 --> 01:09:21,199
What, is it me?

1028
01:09:21,233 --> 01:09:22,968
Oh, my God.
Yeah, it...

1029
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:25,238
- It's my line?
- What's the line?

1030
01:09:25,771 --> 01:09:26,938
Nora?

1031
01:09:31,076 --> 01:09:32,911
- Oh, my God.
- Um...

1032
01:09:32,944 --> 01:09:34,712
What's... What's the line, Nora?

1033
01:09:42,055 --> 01:09:43,588
Nora, please.

1034
01:09:43,622 --> 01:09:46,224
"What's it about,
your dissertation?"

1035
01:09:46,258 --> 01:09:48,760
That's my line?

1036
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:51,730
No wonder I didn't remember it.

1037
01:09:51,763 --> 01:09:54,067
Um, I'm not saying that.

1038
01:09:54,933 --> 01:09:56,334
Uh...

1039
01:09:56,369 --> 01:09:59,171
What, you're gonna start
the scene with a question?

1040
01:09:59,204 --> 01:10:01,174
You should start it
with her answering the question

1041
01:10:01,207 --> 01:10:04,009
so the audience can figure out
what we're talking about.

1042
01:10:04,042 --> 01:10:05,844
That's a better way to do it.

1043
01:10:07,112 --> 01:10:08,747
I mean, she's got a point
with that.

1044
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,749
- Okay, hold on. Okay.
- Thank you.

1045
01:10:10,782 --> 01:10:12,318
No. Guys, if...

1046
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:14,286
You know, if we had
gotten a rehearsal

1047
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:16,822
like, like I had asked for,

1048
01:10:16,855 --> 01:10:20,192
then we can talk about lines, but we do not
have time for a script conference right now.

1049
01:10:20,225 --> 01:10:22,227
I'm not saying the fucking line!

1050
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:29,367
Um...

1051
01:10:33,205 --> 01:10:35,340
Um, Blair, do you mind?
Can we just start with your line?

1052
01:10:35,373 --> 01:10:37,376
Why are you asking her?
It's my line.

1053
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,878
- Blair?
- Whatever you want.

1054
01:10:39,911 --> 01:10:41,346
Okay. Thank you.

1055
01:10:41,379 --> 01:10:43,316
"Whatever you want."

1056
01:10:46,017 --> 01:10:47,819
Are we ready?
Are we still good?

1057
01:10:50,356 --> 01:10:51,756
All right.

1058
01:10:57,229 --> 01:10:59,231
Roll sound.

1059
01:10:59,264 --> 01:11:00,799
Sound speed.

1060
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:04,635
Take 2. Mark.

1061
01:11:07,406 --> 01:11:09,274
Camera set.

1062
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:13,745
Blair, whenever you're ready.

1063
01:11:13,778 --> 01:11:16,281
I would rather talk
about anything else actually.

1064
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,050
What about you?
What do you do?

1065
01:11:18,084 --> 01:11:19,951
No, don't... Don't do that.

1066
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:22,220
Don't try to slither out of it,

1067
01:11:22,254 --> 01:11:24,090
you slippery little snake.

1068
01:11:25,424 --> 01:11:27,826
What?
I'm interested.

1069
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:30,363
I am. I can't remember
the last time

1070
01:11:30,396 --> 01:11:35,033
that we had a PhD
over for dinner.

1071
01:11:35,066 --> 01:11:36,369
Oh, I'm not a PhD yet.

1072
01:11:36,402 --> 01:11:38,170
She... She doesn't want
to talk about it, so...

1073
01:11:38,203 --> 01:11:41,706
Okay, okay,
don't all gang up on me.

1074
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,176
Sweetie, might...
Can you...?

1075
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,181
It's my second drink. Relax.

1076
01:11:48,214 --> 01:11:49,415
Plus, if no one's gonna talk,

1077
01:11:49,448 --> 01:11:52,984
I might as well
get drunk, right?

1078
01:11:53,018 --> 01:11:54,953
I didn't mean
to give you that impression.

1079
01:11:54,986 --> 01:11:57,022
I didn't think you would
think it was interesting.

1080
01:11:57,055 --> 01:11:59,291
Well, honey, if she thinks
we're too stupid to understand

1081
01:11:59,324 --> 01:12:01,394
her highfalutin dissertation...

1082
01:12:01,427 --> 01:12:05,364
Quite the opposite, actually.
You both strike me as highly intelligent.

1083
01:12:05,398 --> 01:12:08,333
Uh, "quite the opposite,
actually," is what she said.

1084
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:10,168
Okay, you're
embarrassing yourself.

1085
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,844
You know what, we all got to
blow off some steam sometimes, right?

1086
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:21,780
Heh, I don't need
to blow off steam.

1087
01:12:21,813 --> 01:12:24,883
And I don't need you to make
excuses for my behavior.

1088
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:27,185
Don't... Don't point.
You're alienating our guest.

1089
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:28,887
No, she's right.

1090
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:32,357
I'm sorry, it's about
the moral complications

1091
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:35,227
that are being engendered
by the cybernetic revolution.

1092
01:12:36,828 --> 01:12:38,129
My dissertation.

1093
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:56,047
Line?

1094
01:12:57,916 --> 01:12:59,452
What's the line?

1095
01:12:59,485 --> 01:13:01,119
What? No, I know my...

1096
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:02,455
I know my line.

1097
01:13:02,488 --> 01:13:04,022
- Okay.
- Okay, fuck it.

1098
01:13:04,055 --> 01:13:05,358
- Can we cut?
- No, keep rolling.

1099
01:13:05,391 --> 01:13:07,393
- I need to cut.
- Okay, fine, cut.

1100
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:10,262
Cut. That's good.
That was good. Yeah?

1101
01:13:10,295 --> 01:13:11,998
- Okay.
- Okay.

1102
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:13,332
That was good.

1103
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,868
Fuck.

1104
01:13:18,037 --> 01:13:20,305
Okay.

1105
01:13:21,339 --> 01:13:22,540
Um...

1106
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:26,344
That was great.
That was amazing.

1107
01:13:26,379 --> 01:13:28,346
- Oh, can I give you, like, a fun note?
- Yeah.

1108
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,349
Um...

1109
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:40,292
- Yeah, that's good.
- That's good.

1110
01:13:40,325 --> 01:13:42,295
- Okay.
- Okay, um...

1111
01:13:42,328 --> 01:13:44,530
Allison,
can I talk to you for a minute?

1112
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:46,998
- Can I talk to you?
- Mm.

1113
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:52,937
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

1114
01:13:52,971 --> 01:13:54,839
What the fuck?

1115
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:01,580
I guess the thing is, um,

1116
01:14:01,614 --> 01:14:04,249
I don't understand
why I say my next line.

1117
01:14:05,618 --> 01:14:07,353
It... It's about
the mark on his neck.

1118
01:14:07,386 --> 01:14:09,287
- Yeah, I know what it's about.
- Okay...

1119
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:11,524
I don't know, I don't know
what I'm doing with it.

1120
01:14:11,557 --> 01:14:13,058
You're marking
your territory.

1121
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:15,393
Okay.

1122
01:14:15,427 --> 01:14:16,995
So when I try
to take care of you,

1123
01:14:17,028 --> 01:14:18,631
you think that
that's what I'm doing?

1124
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:20,965
- What?
- Jesus Christ, you think I'm a fuckin' bitch.

1125
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:22,334
- Allison...
- You do.

1126
01:14:22,367 --> 01:14:24,070
Even when I'm trying
to take care of you...

1127
01:14:24,103 --> 01:14:25,438
- Allison...
- ...you read the worst into it.

1128
01:14:25,471 --> 01:14:27,472
Have you read
the script at all?

1129
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:29,575
'Cause, to me,
it seems like you have,

1130
01:14:29,608 --> 01:14:32,277
because you're wasted and you still
remember every single one of your lines.

1131
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,646
You could've asked me
any questions

1132
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,281
in the last six months,
but you're deciding

1133
01:14:35,314 --> 01:14:37,350
to do it now,
on the last day of shooting,

1134
01:14:37,383 --> 01:14:38,617
when we have
two hours to shoot

1135
01:14:38,651 --> 01:14:40,251
the most important scene
of the film,

1136
01:14:40,285 --> 01:14:41,520
because you decide
to get drunk

1137
01:14:41,554 --> 01:14:43,121
and show up late
to set.

1138
01:14:43,154 --> 01:14:45,023
Okay, not everything
is about you!

1139
01:14:45,056 --> 01:14:46,891
Okay, it's a fucking line
in a movie.

1140
01:14:46,925 --> 01:14:48,260
- Just say it!
- No, it's not! Bullshit!

1141
01:14:48,294 --> 01:14:50,228
You're fucking full of shit!

1142
01:14:50,261 --> 01:14:53,932
All right, um,
okay, everybody, um...

1143
01:14:53,965 --> 01:14:55,900
Oh, you are killing me
with these looks.

1144
01:14:55,934 --> 01:14:58,236
Every single take,
she looks exactly the same.

1145
01:14:58,269 --> 01:15:00,072
I'm sorry,
I'm not trying to be an asshole.

1146
01:15:00,106 --> 01:15:02,508
I'm just under a lot
of stress right now.

1147
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:04,442
Uh...

1148
01:15:04,476 --> 01:15:07,078
Okay, thanks.
Sorry, I'm just...

1149
01:15:08,213 --> 01:15:09,981
Um... Duh-duh.

1150
01:15:10,014 --> 01:15:12,351
- Where are we...? Where are we...?
- What's the line, Nora?

1151
01:15:12,385 --> 01:15:15,320
- What's the line that we just started on?
- Um... Uh...

1152
01:15:15,353 --> 01:15:16,554
Uh...

1153
01:15:18,324 --> 01:15:20,426
"Rachel, cut it out."

1154
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:22,527
- "Rachel, cut it out." We'll got from there.
- That's not a line in the scene.

1155
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,564
Oh, fuck. What's the line
that we just left off on, Nora?

1156
01:15:25,598 --> 01:15:27,298
Oh, my God.

1157
01:15:29,968 --> 01:15:32,003
NORA

1158
01:15:32,036 --> 01:15:34,205
What's the line
that we just started with,

1159
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,041
- just now, just on the last scene?
- Uh...

1160
01:15:36,075 --> 01:15:37,610
The same exact line
we just did?

1161
01:15:37,643 --> 01:15:39,144
Um...

1162
01:15:39,177 --> 01:15:41,280
- Holy God.
- I... I'm so... I'm so sorry.

1163
01:15:41,313 --> 01:15:42,947
God, does anybody know,
what's...?

1164
01:15:42,981 --> 01:15:44,382
"Rachel, you're alienating
our guest."

1165
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:45,984
Fine. Okay.
Let's go from there.

1166
01:15:46,017 --> 01:15:47,520
"Rachel... alienate our guest."

1167
01:15:48,587 --> 01:15:50,955
Oh, my God. All right.

1168
01:15:50,989 --> 01:15:53,492
Let's go. Yeah.

1169
01:15:53,526 --> 01:15:55,494
You're doin' great, guys.
Everyone, honestly.

1170
01:15:55,528 --> 01:15:57,663
Blair, it's really beautiful
work, uh, everyone.

1171
01:15:57,696 --> 01:15:59,097
Thanks so much.

1172
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,666
Are we good?

1173
01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:02,468
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

1174
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:03,501
Are you okay?

1175
01:16:03,535 --> 01:16:05,404
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good.

1176
01:16:05,438 --> 01:16:08,239
All right, um, call it.

1177
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:11,577
Um, roll sound. Ahem.

1178
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:12,678
Sound speed.

1179
01:16:12,711 --> 01:16:14,979
Take three. Mark.

1180
01:16:15,013 --> 01:16:16,247
Camera set.

1181
01:16:19,285 --> 01:16:20,453
Allison...

1182
01:16:24,557 --> 01:16:28,092
Okay. Action.

1183
01:16:28,126 --> 01:16:30,329
Rachel, you're alienating
our guest.

1184
01:16:30,362 --> 01:16:32,765
No, uh, she's right.

1185
01:16:32,798 --> 01:16:34,499
It's about
the moral complications

1186
01:16:34,532 --> 01:16:37,035
that are being engendered
by the cybernetic revolution.

1187
01:16:38,203 --> 01:16:39,504
My dissertation.

1188
01:16:39,537 --> 01:16:41,574
That thing is
still on your neck.

1189
01:16:41,607 --> 01:16:44,710
It's nothing. It's...

1190
01:16:44,743 --> 01:16:46,177
You need
to get it checked out.

1191
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:47,346
Okay.

1192
01:16:49,448 --> 01:16:52,417
- What? It could be malignant.
- It's not malignant, okay.

1193
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:54,520
It's not fucking malignant.
What were you saying?

1194
01:16:54,553 --> 01:16:58,456
The-the moral
implication that you were...

1195
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:00,659
It's about how
morality's changing.

1196
01:17:00,693 --> 01:17:04,295
- Yeah, no, I get it, but, uh...
- You're wasting your time, she thinks we're dumb.

1197
01:17:04,329 --> 01:17:06,131
All right, all right,
that's it.

1198
01:17:06,165 --> 01:17:08,032
Rachel, you're wasted.
That's enough.

1199
01:17:08,066 --> 01:17:10,335
He can't take care
of himself, okay.

1200
01:17:10,368 --> 01:17:12,571
For years, he complains of his stomach ache,
I told him to go to the fucking doctor.

1201
01:17:12,605 --> 01:17:16,174
- Can I get this?
- He wouldn't go. I hassle him for months, he doesn't go...

1202
01:17:16,207 --> 01:17:17,776
- Stop.
- He finally goes, and guess what?

1203
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:20,144
- It's a fuckin' ulcer.
- Rachel, shut up, okay?

1204
01:17:20,178 --> 01:17:22,046
- He's a baby.
- Shut up!

1205
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,549
Shut the fuck up!

1206
01:17:25,818 --> 01:17:30,489
- I-I'm sorry, that's not, that's not how we like normally...
- Why are you talking to her?

1207
01:17:30,523 --> 01:17:32,458
She doesn't care
about you.

1208
01:17:32,491 --> 01:17:34,392
Okay, she doesn't care
about what happens to you.

1209
01:17:34,425 --> 01:17:36,829
I care!
I'm your wife!

1210
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:41,734
She's trying
to steal you away from me.

1211
01:17:41,767 --> 01:17:44,503
- That's fucking insane!
- Don't fucking do that.

1212
01:17:44,537 --> 01:17:46,704
Don't make me
feel crazy, please!

1213
01:17:46,738 --> 01:17:49,575
I am not stupid!

1214
01:17:49,608 --> 01:17:52,410
I'm not! I see how you guys
look at each other!

1215
01:17:52,443 --> 01:17:54,613
It's so fucking obvious!

1216
01:17:54,647 --> 01:17:57,750
Just please, please,
please just be honest with me.

1217
01:17:57,783 --> 01:18:00,219
Just tell me
the fucking truth.

1218
01:18:00,252 --> 01:18:01,787
I'm gonna go.

1219
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,822
No. No, no,
you don't have to do that.

1220
01:18:04,857 --> 01:18:07,426
Rachel, just step aside

1221
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:10,662
and let her go, and then
we can just talk about this.

1222
01:18:10,695 --> 01:18:12,531
So there is something
to talk about.

1223
01:18:12,565 --> 01:18:14,332
- There is nothing going on!
- Okay...

1224
01:18:14,365 --> 01:18:16,634
- Must be.
- Give me the fucking glass.

1225
01:18:16,668 --> 01:18:17,870
There's nothing going on!

1226
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:20,338
He's my husband, okay!

1227
01:18:20,371 --> 01:18:23,442
- Do you understand, bitch?! Get your own fucking husband!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1228
01:18:23,475 --> 01:18:24,743
Jack, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1229
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:28,446
- Oh, fuck!
- Get your own fucking husband!

1230
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:30,115
Uh... cut!

1231
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:31,750
Alli! Cut! Cut! Cut! Alli!

1232
01:18:31,784 --> 01:18:33,484
Alli, cut! Cut! Cut!

1233
01:18:33,518 --> 01:18:35,754
Okay, all right, all right.
All right, you're fine.

1234
01:18:35,788 --> 01:18:38,156
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1235
01:18:38,189 --> 01:18:39,490
Allison, just...

1236
01:18:39,524 --> 01:18:41,160
Allison, you okay?
It's over.

1237
01:18:41,193 --> 01:18:42,695
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1238
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:47,232
I think we need
to take a break, okay?

1239
01:18:47,266 --> 01:18:49,535
Okay, that's fine.

1240
01:18:49,568 --> 01:18:51,436
All right, come on.

1241
01:18:52,837 --> 01:18:54,206
Are you okay?

1242
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:55,374
Oh...

1243
01:18:55,407 --> 01:18:56,875
No. Can somebody
get the kit?

1244
01:18:56,909 --> 01:18:59,578
- Medical kit? Anybody?
- Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm on it.

1245
01:18:59,612 --> 01:19:01,780
- Was it good?
- Yeah, it was great.

1246
01:19:01,814 --> 01:19:03,849
- It was really good.
- Can you use it?

1247
01:19:03,882 --> 01:19:06,251
Yeah, we'll just, um,
we'll change the blocking

1248
01:19:06,285 --> 01:19:08,419
for the last shot,
it'll be great.

1249
01:19:08,454 --> 01:19:10,355
Okay. I need to...

1250
01:19:10,388 --> 01:19:13,692
I think... I have to go.
Medic? Okay? Yeah?

1251
01:19:13,726 --> 01:19:15,493
Thank you.

1252
01:19:15,526 --> 01:19:17,563
Oh, God.

1253
01:19:17,596 --> 01:19:19,498
What'd I miss?

1254
01:19:19,531 --> 01:19:21,800
- Hey, um, set up for the last shot.
- We're not going again on this?

1255
01:19:21,834 --> 01:19:23,802
- No. Here, take this.
- Okay.

1256
01:19:23,836 --> 01:19:25,504
- Oh, there you go.
- There you go.

1257
01:19:27,271 --> 01:19:28,874
That was fucked up. Heh.

1258
01:19:28,907 --> 01:19:32,410
Okay, everybody, let's set up
for the martini.

1259
01:19:40,551 --> 01:19:41,887
No!

1260
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,689
Not right now!

1261
01:19:43,722 --> 01:19:46,357
Just leave me alone!

1262
01:19:46,391 --> 01:19:48,394
Alli, just open the door.

1263
01:19:48,427 --> 01:19:50,529
Don't fucking call me that!

1264
01:19:50,562 --> 01:19:53,399
- Just leave me alone!
- Shh. It's okay, it's okay.

1265
01:19:53,432 --> 01:19:56,935
- Please open the door. Please.
- Go away.

1266
01:19:56,969 --> 01:19:59,672
She just needs some time,
so if you can just give her some time...

1267
01:19:59,705 --> 01:20:01,306
- Please!
- Alli, we need to talk.

1268
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,641
- Now.
- She needs a minute.

1269
01:20:02,675 --> 01:20:05,577
Move. Alli, we need
to talk right now.

1270
01:20:05,611 --> 01:20:08,312
- No.
- Alli, we do not have time.

1271
01:20:08,346 --> 01:20:10,581
Please, just come downstairs.

1272
01:20:10,615 --> 01:20:12,251
You need to leave her alone.

1273
01:20:12,284 --> 01:20:14,318
- Excuse me? Hey...
- I know what you fucking did!

1274
01:20:14,352 --> 01:20:15,788
- Hey. Stop.
- You fucking liar!

1275
01:20:15,821 --> 01:20:17,723
- You fucked her!
- Stop!

1276
01:20:17,756 --> 01:20:20,224
- I know what you did, you fucking asshole!
- Allison, stop. Stop.

1277
01:20:20,258 --> 01:20:22,827
- I know you fucking...
- Stop! Stop!

1278
01:20:22,861 --> 01:20:25,731
- You fucking liar!
- Allison! Stop it.

1279
01:20:25,764 --> 01:20:28,466
Stop it. Allison.

1280
01:20:28,499 --> 01:20:30,836
This is what
you wanted, okay?!

1281
01:20:30,869 --> 01:20:33,906
I fucking told you,
this was going to ruin us!

1282
01:20:33,939 --> 01:20:35,841
I fucking told you that,

1283
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:37,543
but you had
to be in the movie!

1284
01:20:37,576 --> 01:20:40,278
You had to be
the star of the movie!

1285
01:20:40,311 --> 01:20:41,914
How does it feel?

1286
01:20:41,947 --> 01:20:44,248
Allison, how does it feel?
Tell me.

1287
01:20:45,516 --> 01:20:47,486
Just fucking use this.
Just fucking use it.

1288
01:20:47,519 --> 01:20:49,788
- We got one more shot.
- I... Fucking asshole!

1289
01:20:54,993 --> 01:20:56,762
Motherfucker.

1290
01:20:56,795 --> 01:20:57,930
Are you okay, honey?

1291
01:20:57,963 --> 01:20:59,331
No.

1292
01:20:59,364 --> 01:21:00,599
Doin' okay?

1293
01:21:00,632 --> 01:21:01,934
I'm sorry.

1294
01:21:01,967 --> 01:21:03,736
- No, don't be sorry.
- No, no, no, no.

1295
01:21:03,769 --> 01:21:05,871
- You have nothing to be sorry for.
- No, no. No, no, no, no.

1296
01:21:05,904 --> 01:21:07,673
I need Baako.

1297
01:21:09,007 --> 01:21:10,575
- What? Baako?
- Baako?

1298
01:21:10,608 --> 01:21:12,644
- Baako.
- You sure?

1299
01:21:12,678 --> 01:21:14,646
I just want
to talk to Baako.

1300
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,414
- You want me to go get him?
- Yes.

1301
01:21:16,447 --> 01:21:19,051
You want me
to stay with you?

1302
01:21:19,084 --> 01:21:20,753
I'll be okay.
Let me just talk to Baako.

1303
01:21:20,786 --> 01:21:23,288
- Okay.
- I need to talk to him.

1304
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:26,959
Just get him. Yeah.

1305
01:21:46,611 --> 01:21:48,680
But you only have to
probably do it one more time.

1306
01:21:48,714 --> 01:21:49,782
And... Oh, thanks.

1307
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:54,686
She's asking for Baako.

1308
01:22:10,535 --> 01:22:11,737
Hey.

1309
01:22:19,845 --> 01:22:23,348
I love you.

1310
01:22:23,382 --> 01:22:26,985
- I need to talk to you.
- Hey.

1311
01:22:27,019 --> 01:22:28,686
- I just...
- Wh...? Wh...?

1312
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:31,356
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1313
01:22:39,131 --> 01:22:40,967
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1314
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,135
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

1315
01:22:43,168 --> 01:22:44,603
It's okay.

1316
01:22:52,577 --> 01:22:53,912
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1317
01:22:53,946 --> 01:22:56,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1318
01:22:57,548 --> 01:22:59,952
- Hey...
- Hey...

1319
01:23:02,688 --> 01:23:04,488
Just tell me
you love me.

1320
01:23:07,092 --> 01:23:09,061
Please.

1321
01:23:09,094 --> 01:23:11,396
You don't have
to mean it.

1322
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:12,865
You don't have
to mean it.

1323
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:17,603
I love you.

1324
01:23:17,636 --> 01:23:19,438
Except, when you grab her,
when you pull her...

1325
01:23:19,471 --> 01:23:21,173
Last I heard, we're good.

1326
01:23:21,206 --> 01:23:23,442
Looks a lot better.
Can you turn for me?

1327
01:23:32,718 --> 01:23:35,554
Okay, everybody,
we're back in on the martini.

1328
01:23:40,927 --> 01:23:43,862
Hey. Okay.

1329
01:23:43,896 --> 01:23:46,164
Um, we're just gonna go

1330
01:23:46,198 --> 01:23:48,033
from when you're on top of her.

1331
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:51,770
Just don't... don't hit her,
or anything, okay?

1332
01:23:51,803 --> 01:23:54,039
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1333
01:23:54,072 --> 01:23:55,173
No, no, not now.

1334
01:23:55,207 --> 01:23:56,642
She looks perfect
the way she is.

1335
01:23:56,675 --> 01:23:58,110
I do not need
these looks right now.

1336
01:23:58,143 --> 01:24:00,545
Just leave it.
Okay, so you're

1337
01:24:00,579 --> 01:24:03,749
just gonna get on top of her,
Mike is gonna pull you off,

1338
01:24:03,782 --> 01:24:05,751
and that's it. Okay?

1339
01:24:06,885 --> 01:24:08,654
- Okay? Are we good?
- Yep.

1340
01:24:08,687 --> 01:24:10,488
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay, everyone, first position.

1341
01:24:10,521 --> 01:24:13,458
- Yep.
- Roll sound.

1342
01:24:13,492 --> 01:24:15,060
Sound speed.

1343
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:18,463
Take four. Pick up.
Mark.

1344
01:24:21,532 --> 01:24:22,936
Camera set.

1345
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:25,971
Allison, you ready?

1346
01:24:29,741 --> 01:24:31,243
Action.

1347
01:24:31,276 --> 01:24:33,912
- Get out of my house!
- Stop it!

1348
01:24:33,946 --> 01:24:35,647
- God, you guys!
- Stop!

1349
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:37,783
He's my husband!

1350
01:24:37,816 --> 01:24:41,087
You fucking stole him!
He's my husband!

1351
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,155
- Get out of my house!
- Stop it!

1352
01:24:43,188 --> 01:24:45,090
I'll fucking kill you!

1353
01:24:45,123 --> 01:24:49,261
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

1354
01:24:49,294 --> 01:24:51,662
Cut!

1355
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,934
Uh...

1356
01:25:03,075 --> 01:25:05,911
Baako, was that good?
We fine with that?

1357
01:25:05,944 --> 01:25:07,879
It was a little soft.

1358
01:25:07,913 --> 01:25:10,749
- Honestly? Was it really?
- Got a little soft.

1359
01:25:10,782 --> 01:25:11,917
Okay.

1360
01:25:16,088 --> 01:25:19,124
Okay. Give us one second.

1361
01:25:19,157 --> 01:25:21,559
Alli. Allison.

1362
01:25:21,592 --> 01:25:24,830
Do you have another...
another in you? Can you do one more for me?

1363
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:27,165
Can you?

1364
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:30,136
Yeah? Okay.

1365
01:25:30,169 --> 01:25:31,303
Okay, let's go again.

1366
01:25:31,337 --> 01:25:32,971
Okay, everyone,
back to one.

1367
01:25:33,005 --> 01:25:34,306
Right away, please.
No looks, nothing.

1368
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:35,874
Back to one.

1369
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,544
- Yeah, yeah, call.
- Roll sound.

1370
01:25:40,578 --> 01:25:42,114
Sound speed.

1371
01:25:44,716 --> 01:25:48,020
Take five, pick up. Mark.

1372
01:25:51,023 --> 01:25:52,157
Camera set.

1373
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,825
Allison, you ready?

1374
01:25:58,596 --> 01:26:00,899
Action.

1375
01:26:00,932 --> 01:26:02,868
Get out of my house!

1376
01:26:02,901 --> 01:26:04,971
- Get out of my house, you fucking bitch!
- Stop! Get off of her!

1377
01:26:05,004 --> 01:26:06,972
I'll fucking kill you!

1378
01:26:07,005 --> 01:26:09,207
You stole him from me!

1379
01:26:09,241 --> 01:26:11,177
He's my husband!

1380
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:13,812
He's my husband!

1381
01:26:13,845 --> 01:26:15,679
You fucking cunt!

1382
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:18,151
I'll fucking kill you!

1383
01:26:18,184 --> 01:26:19,885
I'll kill you!

1384
01:26:23,289 --> 01:26:25,223
How could you?

1385
01:26:25,257 --> 01:26:27,591
How could you fall
in love with her?

1386
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:30,095
You were supposed
to love me.

1387
01:26:30,128 --> 01:26:32,998
You were supposed
to love me always.

1388
01:26:34,032 --> 01:26:36,968
You're supposed
to love me.

1389
01:26:37,002 --> 01:26:38,303
Why did you...?

1390
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:41,307
You're always supposed
to love me!

1391
01:26:41,340 --> 01:26:42,841
You fuck...

1392
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:46,645
You were supposed
to love me.

1393
01:26:53,852 --> 01:26:56,321
You were supposed
to love me.

1394
01:26:57,655 --> 01:27:00,025
You're always
supposed to love me.

1395
01:27:19,378 --> 01:27:20,912
Okay...

1396
01:27:22,347 --> 01:27:23,982
Okay, cut! Cut!

1397
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:27,786
Okay, Allison,
it's gonna be okay.

1398
01:27:27,819 --> 01:27:30,423
All right? Okay? Okay?

1399
01:27:30,456 --> 01:27:33,358
Allison, Allison,
it's over, it's over.

1400
01:27:33,391 --> 01:27:35,361
It's over.
It's over.

1401
01:27:35,394 --> 01:27:37,996
Allison.
I know.

1402
01:27:38,029 --> 01:27:39,730
It's over, it's over.

1403
01:27:42,401 --> 01:27:43,869
Check the gate!

1404
01:27:45,003 --> 01:27:46,905
Gate is good.

1405
01:27:51,843 --> 01:27:53,179
Hold for room tone.

1406
01:28:43,295 --> 01:28:45,096
Cut on room tone.

1407
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:57,342
Okay.

1408
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:59,045
Okay. Okay.

1409
01:29:01,146 --> 01:29:02,714
Thank you.

1410
01:29:04,349 --> 01:29:07,219
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

1411
01:29:12,458 --> 01:29:13,925
Come on.

1412
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:16,828
Come on.

1413
01:29:21,933 --> 01:29:25,337
Uh, okay, everybody,
that's a wrap on <i>Black Bear.</i>

1414
01:29:45,991 --> 01:29:47,059
Okay?

1415
01:29:47,093 --> 01:29:49,227
- I did a bad thing.
- Mm-mm.

1416
01:29:49,261 --> 01:29:51,162
- I'm sorry.
- Mm. Hey.

1417
01:29:51,196 --> 01:29:53,432
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1418
01:29:56,101 --> 01:29:59,005
- Okay. Okay, come on.
- No.

1419
01:30:07,413 --> 01:30:08,980
Okay.

1420
01:30:10,915 --> 01:30:12,518
No. It's okay.

1421
01:30:12,551 --> 01:30:14,486
It's okay
if you love her, Bear.

1422
01:30:16,888 --> 01:30:19,324
I need you to lift
your legs, baby.

1423
01:30:19,357 --> 01:30:21,326
She's better for you.

1424
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:22,495
She's...

1425
01:30:23,995 --> 01:30:25,997
She's nicer.

1426
01:30:26,031 --> 01:30:28,366
She's prettier.

1427
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,502
She's everything.

1428
01:30:29,535 --> 01:30:32,837
I'm... I'm bad.

1429
01:30:32,871 --> 01:30:35,274
- I'm too much.
- Stop.

1430
01:30:35,308 --> 01:30:36,375
- I am.
- Stop.

1431
01:30:36,409 --> 01:30:38,009
I'm too much.

1432
01:30:42,914 --> 01:30:44,049
No...

1433
01:30:44,082 --> 01:30:46,318
Listen, baby...

1434
01:30:46,351 --> 01:30:48,019
I need you to listen to me.

1435
01:30:51,122 --> 01:30:52,957
You were amazing tonight.

1436
01:30:53,626 --> 01:30:55,327
Hey.

1437
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,595
Look at me.
Look at me.

1438
01:30:57,629 --> 01:30:59,065
Look at me.

1439
01:31:00,031 --> 01:31:01,500
This movie

1440
01:31:01,534 --> 01:31:03,568
is going
to change your life.

1441
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:05,404
- I don't care.
- It is.

1442
01:31:05,438 --> 01:31:07,339
I don't care about that.

1443
01:31:08,506 --> 01:31:10,208
I don't.

1444
01:31:10,241 --> 01:31:12,143
I care about you.

1445
01:31:12,177 --> 01:31:13,912
I love you.

1446
01:31:13,945 --> 01:31:16,181
You should love her.

1447
01:31:16,214 --> 01:31:19,485
You should. I'm fucked up.

1448
01:31:20,585 --> 01:31:21,986
Nothing...

1449
01:31:23,055 --> 01:31:24,923
Nothing happened with Blair.

1450
01:31:38,536 --> 01:31:41,040
You're not...

1451
01:31:41,073 --> 01:31:42,308
You're not in love with her?

1452
01:31:42,341 --> 01:31:43,942
No. Heh.

1453
01:31:45,343 --> 01:31:46,978
You didn't sleep with her?

1454
01:31:47,012 --> 01:31:48,280
No.

1455
01:31:50,382 --> 01:31:52,117
You're not mad at me?

1456
01:32:07,132 --> 01:32:08,266
Okay.

1457
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:15,140
No, don't leave.

1458
01:32:15,173 --> 01:32:16,475
Don't leave, please.

1459
01:32:16,509 --> 01:32:18,176
- Don't leave.
- But honey...

1460
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:21,079
- Come on.
- I got to go thank the crew.

1461
01:32:21,112 --> 01:32:23,015
- Heh, I know.
- They're important.

1462
01:32:23,048 --> 01:32:24,115
- I know they are.
- Yeah?

1463
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:25,350
- I know you know.
- I know.

1464
01:32:25,383 --> 01:32:27,185
- I know.
- You're good.

1465
01:32:27,218 --> 01:32:29,321
- You're a good man.
- Yeah.

1466
01:32:29,355 --> 01:32:30,556
You're a good boy.

1467
01:32:31,657 --> 01:32:34,092
But just stay
with me for a little bit.

1468
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:35,327
- Okay?
- I can't.

1469
01:32:35,361 --> 01:32:37,530
- Just for a minute, please.
- Okay.

1470
01:32:44,602 --> 01:32:47,173
Do you remember what
it was like in the beginning?

1471
01:32:47,206 --> 01:32:48,574
Mm-hm.

1472
01:32:48,607 --> 01:32:50,442
Before all of this?

1473
01:32:51,743 --> 01:32:53,245
Remember?

1474
01:32:54,346 --> 01:32:56,281
Before all the movies?

1475
01:32:57,682 --> 01:33:00,051
We were so happy.

1476
01:33:00,084 --> 01:33:02,120
I want to go back there.

1477
01:33:02,153 --> 01:33:05,024
I just want to be
normal people again.

1478
01:33:10,329 --> 01:33:12,997
- Do you think we could do that?
- Mm-hm.

1479
01:33:13,031 --> 01:33:15,233
Do you think we could go back

1480
01:33:15,266 --> 01:33:16,669
and just be normal?

1481
01:33:16,702 --> 01:33:18,002
Shh...

1482
01:33:18,036 --> 01:33:19,337
And...

1483
01:33:27,145 --> 01:33:29,114
Do you think
those people are gone?

1484
01:33:34,286 --> 01:33:36,355
We killed them, didn't we?

1485
01:33:36,388 --> 01:33:38,022
Hey, hey,

1486
01:33:38,056 --> 01:33:39,057
listen to me.

1487
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:40,559
Listen.

1488
01:33:40,593 --> 01:33:41,993
Baby...

1489
01:33:43,729 --> 01:33:48,334
Look, this has all been
some kind of insane dream.

1490
01:33:48,367 --> 01:33:51,035
You know?
Okay.

1491
01:33:52,103 --> 01:33:54,507
And I think...

1492
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,241
I think
when we wake up tomorrow,

1493
01:33:56,274 --> 01:33:58,243
things are gonna look
a lot different.

1494
01:34:00,579 --> 01:34:02,080
Yeah?

1495
01:34:07,653 --> 01:34:09,220
Yeah.

1496
01:34:14,392 --> 01:34:16,595
I still love you, Bear.

1497
01:34:23,269 --> 01:34:25,270
I still love you.

1498
01:34:28,274 --> 01:34:31,409
I don't care what happened.

1499
01:34:31,443 --> 01:34:33,478
I still love you, Bear.

1500
01:34:37,282 --> 01:34:39,484
I'll always love you.

1501
01:35:32,905 --> 01:35:35,874
- No.
- It smells delicious.

1502
01:35:35,908 --> 01:35:37,910
- Really. Really.
- Stop it.

1503
01:35:37,943 --> 01:35:40,179
- Really good.
- Hm?

1504
01:35:40,212 --> 01:35:41,747
Does it?

1505
01:37:02,895 --> 01:37:04,296
Hey.

1506
01:37:06,331 --> 01:37:07,432
Hey.

1507
01:37:22,481 --> 01:37:24,650
That was some game
we played.

1508
01:37:27,518 --> 01:37:28,721
Yeah.

1509
01:37:29,788 --> 01:37:31,890
I'm not feeling
too proud of myself.

1510
01:37:37,629 --> 01:37:39,831
I think you made
a great movie.

1511
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,468
Movies
aren't everything.

1512
01:37:45,369 --> 01:37:47,372
Is she okay?

1513
01:37:47,406 --> 01:37:48,907
She's out cold.

1514
01:37:51,576 --> 01:37:54,313
Did you tell her
you weren't in love with me?

1515
01:38:30,015 --> 01:38:31,984
You know you can't.

1516
01:38:33,384 --> 01:38:35,387
You...

1517
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:37,990
Okay! Heh.

1518
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:40,592
No!

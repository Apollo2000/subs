2
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,025
Since the beginning
of the drug war in 2006

3
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,071
160,000 have been killed and
53,000 have disappeared in Mexico.

4
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:17,869
Entire areas of some cities
are turning into ghost towns.

5
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,498
There are no numbers
for the children

6
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,459
the dead and the
missing have left behind.

7
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:27,713
Okay. Fairy tales, guys.

8
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:31,800
Name some fairy tale characters.

9
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,218
Fairies!

10
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,721
Princes?

11
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,308
Wishes! 3 wishes!

12
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,270
Foxes! Witches! Ghosts!

13
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,897
- What else?
- Castles!

14
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,650
And tigers!

15
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,654
Now, using those
elements and characters

16
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:57,242
you're going to write
your own fairy tale, okay?

17
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:01,079
No chatting! Concentrate, guys.

18
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,625
Keep quiet. Focus on your story.

19
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,085
No cheating!

20
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:12,716
Once upon a time, there was a
Prince who wanted to be a tiger.

21
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,264
Tigers never forget.

22
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,018
They're hunters.

23
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,814
Their eyes can see in the dark.

24
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,319
They have fangs, to break bones.

25
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,116
Tigers are not afraid.

26
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,217
Where you going, Caco?

27
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:00,097
None of your fucking business!

28
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,395
Leave me alone!

29
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,732
Caco, come on!

30
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,780
But the Prince
couldn't become a tiger.

31
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:45,368
Because he had forgotten
how to be a Prince.

32
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,166
We forget that we are Princes,

33
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,001
warriors,

34
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,337
tigers.

35
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,674
When the things from
outside come to get us.

36
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,781
Stay on the floor...

37
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,577
Estrella!

38
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,751
Here. 3 wishes!

39
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,753
Like in fairy tales...

40
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,755
3 wishes.

41
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,097
It's going to be all right!

42
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,852
Let's go back to
our fairy tale list...

43
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,822
Classes suspended
until further notice.

44
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,813
We forget who we are,

45
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:41,860
when the things from
outside come to get us.

46
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:56,033
TIGERS ARE NOT AFRAID

47
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,338
Mom, I'm home!

48
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,841
With your vote, Servando Esparza

49
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,970
can bring back
safety and peace...

50
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:18,104
Mom, they closed the
school. There's no classes.

51
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,454
Servando Esparza, ♪El
Chino ♪ needs your vote...

52
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,776
Want me to waste you? Huh?

53
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,662
Leggo of my lamp! Ew!!

54
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,964
Whadaya want, Morro?

55
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,842
The tiger?

56
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,221
Shine, he wants you
tellin' the tiger story.

57
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,348
Come on, Morro, again??

58
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,851
Don't come later
saying you can't sleep!

59
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,107
Here. Give it some epic.

60
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,028
There was this very rich dude

61
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,364
he had many wild animals.

62
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,242
He had tigers,

63
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,369
lions,

64
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,203
pumas,

65
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,329
panthers,

66
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,040
jaguars...

67
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,209
But one day the Huascas came.

68
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,129
And they killed him.

69
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,383
Caco and the other Huascas

70
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,011
killed all his animals.

71
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,183
But when they got
to the tiger's cage...

72
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,185
He had escaped.

73
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:27,108
Now he's prowling
the dark alleys

74
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,902
angry,

75
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,695
and hungry.

76
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,906
He feeds on:

77
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,449
dogs,

78
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,451
cats...

79
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,791
and children with no parents.

80
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,133
And that's it.

81
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:28,795
Please, leave your
message after the tone.

82
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,594
Mom, where are you?

83
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,264
I'm hungry.

84
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,934
Please, call me.

85
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,566
I'm a Princess?

86
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,361
No. You are a warrior.

87
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,865
And then?

88
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,826
And then the spell was broken,

89
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,996
and the Prince
was a Prince again.

90
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,331
And then?

91
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,375
And then it's time
to go to sleep,

92
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,962
because tomorrow
is a school day!

93
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,593
Estrella! You have to sleep!

94
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:04,140
Mom! When can I have
your birdies bracelet?

95
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,809
When you"re a big girl...

96
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,357
And I'm not around anymore.

97
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,042
I wish my mom would come back.

98
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,735
Estrella...

99
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,283
Estrella.

100
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,417
I'm here...

101
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,066
You still around?

102
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,112
- Let go!
- No!

103
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,989
Let go, kiddo!

104
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,283
No, this is my mom's!

105
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,119
What do you want??

106
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,372
Your mom needs shit!
The Huascas took her!

107
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,045
'Tis not true! She
came back last night!

108
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,924
Estrella...

109
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,135
Come...

110
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,524
MISSING

111
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,016
Ugly ass movie...

112
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,853
so much anger, dude...

113
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,106
Pure bad vibe, guys.

114
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,568
Dead people and shit.

115
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,279
Let's see what you got us...

116
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,949
Beans? Again? Fancy.

117
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,661
Where did you
steal all this shit?

118
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,205
More phones?

119
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,042
Like we had anybody to call!

120
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,798
We can call each other, asshole!

121
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,718
Another iPhone?

122
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,597
You haven't even sold
that one with the dragon!

123
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,184
- This is not for selling, butthead.
- Gimme that.

124
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,813
You picking the
green peas again?

125
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,690
Tell'im, Shine!

126
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,442
Tucsi, eat them green peas.

127
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,652
I don't like green peas!

128
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,988
Eat them! They're your veggies!

129
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,199
Shit! Shit!

130
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,499
- Who's the chick?
- She's stuck.

131
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,168
- Stuck to what?
- To my ass.

132
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,670
I'm hungry.

133
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,011
We don't give a shit
you're hungry. Right, Pop?

134
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,765
Yeah. Tiger should eat
your ass. True dat, Tucsi?

135
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,892
True. Tiger likes human meat.

136
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,186
Specially female.

137
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,479
Show her, Morro.

138
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,151
Goodbye, kiddo.

139
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,739
No! Please! Don't
make me go home!

140
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,700
- Let her go!
- I don't want to go to my house!!

141
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,622
Let her stay.

142
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,543
The Huascas will grab
her. She won't last long.

143
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,713
- They'll take her to Chino. She's toast.
- She's a chick.

144
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,050
Chicks are bad luck.

145
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,556
Let's cover up. Come on.

146
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,599
Morro, do something, dude!

147
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,560
Stop stuffing your face, runt!

148
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,541
Thank...

149
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,003
Morro! What did I say?

150
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,830
Mom?

151
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,499
Estrella...

152
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,344
What's wrong??

153
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,679
The Huascas??

154
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:12,485
If you wake me up again
I'll kick your pink girly ass!!

155
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,755
Kiddo!

156
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:34,715
The Huascas are coming!!

157
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,525
You run somewhere else! Go!

158
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,070
Shine!

159
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,289
Move it!

160
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,458
Now! Run!

161
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,639
I will kill you, motherfucker!!

162
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,808
That's my gun, asshole!

163
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,520
- Let's go, Shine!
- Where did you get that gun, fucker?

164
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,606
You got my phone,
son of a bitch?

165
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,402
You'll give me that
phone back, asshole!!

166
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,330
Shine!

167
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,460
And Morro?

168
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,794
They took him!

169
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:57,965
They nabbed his little footsie!

170
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,509
He left his plushy tiger, dude!

171
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,183
What happens to
the ones they take?

172
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,518
They grab'em and
take'm to Chino.

173
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,897
Chino chops them off
and they sell the parts.

174
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,317
They're narco-satanics.
They have a deal with the devil.

175
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,987
- And they have satanic virtuals.
- Rituals. Not virtuals.

176
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,574
- They can be virtual!
- No, they are really real, not virtu...

177
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,994
The women, they kill.

178
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,288
The kids... look at me!

179
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,501
The kids they take
who knows where.

180
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,712
And you know why
they took Morro?

181
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,881
Because of you!

182
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:42,676
Because they saw
there's a chick with us!

183
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,013
- No, they wanted that cell...
- No! It was YOUR fault!

184
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,934
I can make that
Huasca disappear.

185
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,157
Go kill him.

186
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,249
We'll take you to his place.

187
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:18,462
You kill him, you
can stay with us.

188
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,017
- How will I get in?
- You jump.

189
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,435
You knock.

190
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,563
And you kill him.

191
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,573
Uhm... I don't think so.

192
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,867
That asshole killed your mom.

193
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,785
Yours too.

194
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,289
You kill him. You're
the man here.

195
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,457
True dat, Shine.

196
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,837
If you don't turn into
a man and kill'im,

197
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,923
tomorrow he'll come
for you, he'll find you

198
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,802
and cut you in pieces and
eat you in a satanic ritual!

199
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:10,306
- Or virtual.
- Virt... I don't give a shit, OK?

200
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,019
Thing is, kiddo...

201
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,607
if he doesn't die, we all die.

202
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:32,244
Go! Move! Go!

203
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,204
Move it!

204
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,643
Go! Keep moving!

205
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:46,694
This candidate, Servando
Esparza, also known as El Chino,

206
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:51,865
has strong ties with
the organized crime...

207
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,828
and the infamous
Huascas gang works for him.

208
00:24:55,869 --> 00:25:01,083
El Chino has been directly
involved in human trafficking,

209
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:05,462
kidnapping, torture,
and multiple homicides,

210
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:09,550
on top of his connections
with the drug-trade.

211
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,434
I wish I didn't
have to kill him...

212
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,344
- Come!
- Come!

213
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,640
- Let us out!
- Come!

214
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,233
You kept all your pieces!

215
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,028
And she goes into the
house, tippy-toe, tippy-toe...

216
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,740
And BOOM! Caco is right
there!! Eating kids! And Pizza Hut!!

217
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:00,035
So she pulls out the gun...

218
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,411
aims at Caco!

219
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,164
No, little girl, please!

220
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,917
I will not eat any
more kids or pizza!

221
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,169
BAM!! She offs him!

222
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,131
No more pepperoni for you!

223
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,426
How did you do it?

224
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,853
I made a wish.

225
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,902
If I had any wishes, I
would have killed him.

226
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,071
But I have shit.

227
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,799
Why are you mad?

228
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,940
That's the phone Caco wanted?

229
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,325
Why do you keep it?

230
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,666
Tucsi's gramma
got shot at a funeral.

231
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,380
Pop's brothers got
picked up by the highway.

232
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:41,011
Morro? They say
he saw something.

233
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,891
Something bad.
Now he doesn't speak.

234
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:50,020
All because of that son of a
bitch and his fucking brothers.

235
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,111
But now Caco is dead, and...

236
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,498
Come show us your moves!

237
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,754
Estrella...

238
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,840
Estrella...

239
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,520
They will come for you...

240
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,481
for his death.

241
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,984
I didn't kill him!

242
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,819
No.

243
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:26,158
The one who killed
him is looking for you...

244
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,412
and he will find you.

245
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,376
You have to bring him to me.

246
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,013
What the...!

247
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,725
Estrella says we
need a better crib.

248
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,644
Where each has our own room,

249
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,689
a soccer field, a zoo, an arcade

250
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,817
a shitload of commodities
and a heated pool.

251
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,111
- She did not!
- But it'd be awesome.

252
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,654
Okay, THAT'S IT!

253
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,199
Everybody calm the fuck down!

254
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,701
My house! My operation!

255
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,828
And there's no houses with...

256
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,706
soccer pool zoos
or any of that shit!

257
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,291
Toldya.

258
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,877
The Huascas know where we are.

259
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,213
And one of them got killed.

260
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,299
You killed him.

261
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,429
That's why we have to go.

262
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,309
Move it, Morro! Grab that box.

263
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:41,441
Hey, Disney Princesses! Move it!

264
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,777
Lazy asshats.

265
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,714
Shine...

266
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,429
You still mad?

267
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,393
What up?

268
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,938
What's their problem?

269
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,316
They're crying 'cause
they miss their brother.

270
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,527
He's with Brayan's gang.

271
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:26,945
Fine. Go!

272
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:31,450
No, 'cause Estrella killed
Caco, so they're afraid.

273
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,955
So? I'm the idiot who's supposed
to take them back to Brayan?

274
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,833
You gotta be kidding me...

275
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,560
Watch this...

276
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,273
Take that, asshole!

277
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,108
200 bucks, pussy!

278
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,401
Chato! Agus!

279
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,362
- No way!
- Hey! Those are my brothers!

280
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:13,617
- Caco took them! They're his!
- Caco is dead, Brayan.

281
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,205
Yeah, right...

282
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,041
We killed him.

283
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,887
Give me a fucking break!

284
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,430
Estrella killed him.

285
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,682
Shit, Shine...

286
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,520
You sent a girl to do your job?

287
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,318
In my gang,

288
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:54,157
girls are tougher than your
bunch of pussywipes, asshole.

289
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,703
They're gonna find you, Shine.

290
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,540
Chino, and what's
left of the Huascas.

291
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,125
If you offed Caco,

292
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,878
they're gonna kill you.

293
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,840
They're gonna kill you all.

294
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,884
We'll hide.

295
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,889
Yeah. Right. Where?

296
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,363
Stop it, Morro.
Don't be such a baby.

297
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,908
One! Two! THREE!

298
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,955
Come, Morro! Run, Tucsi!

299
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,509
Wow! It's like that
Lord of the Rings place!

300
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,974
Dude! Awesome!!

301
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:04,144
Look!

302
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:10,442
- Where did they come from?
- They escaped their fish bowl.

303
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,116
Look! That one
looks like Morrito!

304
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,827
I'll call that one Estrella...

305
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,372
That's you! The troublemaker!

306
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,876
This is like your zoo,
but with only fishies!

307
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,337
If there's a zoo...

308
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,256
There's a gotta
be a soccer field!

309
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,261
Come on, Morro!

310
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,898
Soccer field... my ass.

311
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,578
Estrella...

312
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,789
Come...

313
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,917
Come...

314
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:37,362
Estrella... they are
coming for you...

315
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,408
Come with me...

316
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,380
Estrella... come. Come...

317
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,909
Shine...

318
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,872
What is it?

319
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,880
It should've been me
the one who killed him.

320
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:51,770
Don't answer!

321
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,273
Where the fuck are
you, you fucking kids?

322
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:58,109
You killed my brother,
sons of bitches!

323
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,820
That little bitch did it!!

324
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:04,032
Give that phone
back, or we're gonna...

325
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,867
Fucking Brayan.

326
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,496
Why do you keep that phone?

327
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,803
That's the only photo
I've got of my mom.

328
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:29,390
Caco took it when
he grabbed her?

329
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,318
What happened??

330
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,821
No soccer field,
but we found this!

331
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,728
Make room for number 4.

332
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,360
You moron...

333
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:27,115
That's a Y, not a 4!

334
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,701
Now the name! The name!!

335
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,912
It looks like a claw!

336
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:36,583
Not to worry, Morro! It
will only last a month!

337
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,974
Let me see...

338
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,102
It looks like Caco.

339
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,835
Here.

340
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,674
You drew her
kittens, you ninnie??

341
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,511
They're tigers, asshole.
They'll protect her.

342
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,264
Let's see yours, Morro...

343
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,232
What happened to him?

344
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,568
He fell.

345
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,987
Here, I'll fix him.

346
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:55,161
Be careful. You
can prick yourself...

347
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,082
There. Don't cry.

348
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,215
Look, he's okay now!

349
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,191
Why do you have wishes?

350
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,239
Turn off that light!

351
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,659
People need to sleep! Jeez...

352
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,729
These fishes are
just like the tiger.

353
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,108
They escaped their cage.

354
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,448
Poor tiger.

355
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,243
He had a home.

356
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,038
A mom.

357
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,916
In the jungle.

358
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,543
Now he's all alone.

359
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,879
He's scared.

360
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,839
No.

361
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,803
He's been through
all the bad stuff.

362
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,139
And now he's free to
go anywhere he wants.

363
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,935
He's the King of this
fucked up kingdom.

364
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,899
Tigers are not afraid.

365
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,908
Is your mom's
picture in the phone?

366
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,790
You got any pictures of her?

367
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,670
I left them home.

368
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:59,053
I left mine too.
And they burned.

369
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,098
They burned your house?

370
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:07,562
They spilled gas on it and...

371
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,150
they threw this in.

372
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,837
They grabbed my mom too...

373
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,260
when we were running out.

374
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,518
What are you going to
do with your last wish?

375
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,771
I can't bring your mom back.

376
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:02,283
But maybe you could wish...

377
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,330
that this burn in
my face goes away.

378
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,247
No.

379
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:11,500
And I'll get your mom's
photos from your place...

380
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,962
Every time I make a wish,

381
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,006
something really bad happens.

382
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,592
What do you mean
something bad...?

383
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,340
You fucking thief!

384
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,425
Where's that fucking phone?

385
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,677
Where is it?

386
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,305
Who has it, asshole?

387
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,600
That little bitch who
did my brother in?

388
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:12,103
You'll take me to her, you hear?

389
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,437
Next!

390
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,949
What's your name, contestant?

391
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,910
- Rappop.
- And what's your talent?

392
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,704
I rap.

393
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,331
Okay! Amaze us.

394
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,510
And Shine?

395
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:48,639
Dunno. But you wanna be a star?

396
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,771
Shit...

397
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,982
My twinkles, dude!

398
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,067
That act sucks. Big time.

399
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,819
You stinker!

400
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,904
Get off my stage!

401
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:07,116
- I know where you live!
- Don't think so.

402
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,158
Next!

403
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,135
Right, Chino.

404
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:31,682
I swear we'll get it
this time. Yes, boss.

405
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:33,976
Right, sir.

406
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,749
Estrella...

407
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,378
They're coming to get you.

408
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,649
Bring him.

409
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:29,323
To us. To where
the dead wait for him.

410
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,284
Estrella...

411
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,204
come!

412
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,837
Where's that fucking phone??

413
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,297
I'm gonna loosen you up, slut...

414
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,924
ESTRELLA!

415
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,219
Son of a bitch! Kill
that motherfucker!

416
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,166
Let's go!

417
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:09,048
Why do they want
this phone so bad?

418
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:17,806
Must be something in it...

419
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,726
What's this?

420
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,445
Stop it!

421
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,417
STOP IT!!

422
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,139
- You recording me?
- No, Chino.

423
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,933
It's Chino...

424
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:04,436
Caco recorded this to screw him.

425
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,148
Find Chino.

426
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,527
Call him.

427
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,782
Why would I call him?

428
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,868
Just call him.

429
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,305
You've got something I need.

430
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,516
You will give it back.

431
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:46,687
Or I'll go looking
for it. And I'll find it.

432
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:50,357
We'll give it to you.

433
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,401
When?

434
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,531
When you make the
Huascas disappear.

435
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,909
Tomorrow at seven AM.

436
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,203
Where?

437
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:07,666
There's an old spa by the railroad.
Across an abandoned gas station.

438
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,044
You bring me that phone

439
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:12,880
and the Huascas
are done, right there.

440
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,673
Or you don't come.

441
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:18,844
But then I'll go find you.

442
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:23,057
And I'll do to you the
same thing I did to Caco.

443
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,894
Because you didn't
kill him, did you?

444
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:30,105
Even if you're telling
everyone you did...

445
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,691
It was me who killed him, girl.

446
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:37,488
Because he didn't give me
that phone. Think about it.

447
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,449
LIAR!!

448
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:46,455
You said you killed
Caco! But it wasn't you!

449
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,750
And look what happened!!

450
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,808
Liar! Look after Morro!

451
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:46,515
See you, Morrito!

452
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,578
Estrella...

453
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,791
Another dead one.

454
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,216
Because of him.

455
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:15,062
Here we are... all of us.

456
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,566
Bring him to us...

457
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,920
See? He's not
at the bus station.

458
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:43,006
- Lucky guess.
- No, it was my 5th sense.

459
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,842
Jesus, shut up already.

460
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,177
What do you want?

461
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:50,264
Shine, can I have the phone?

462
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:55,435
- What for?
- I wanna make a call.

463
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:03,360
No, give me Caco's phone. We
don't have the code for this one.

464
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,074
Who you gonna call, anyways?

465
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,618
No! Pop!

466
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,747
Tucsi! Come here!

467
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,457
Come back here!

468
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,223
Bring him...

469
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,023
Bring him to us.

470
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,026
To where he put us all.

471
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,239
Bring him to us!

472
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,420
Tigers are not afraid,
tigers are not afraid!

473
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:05,464
Tigers are not afraid!!

474
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,131
No fucking way!
Cops are the worst!

475
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,842
- They can help us!
- No way!

476
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,553
So give me that phone!

477
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,097
Stop it, Shine!

478
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,016
Here's a video of
Chino killing somebody!

479
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:01,645
- And who catches killers?
- Dunno, but not the cops!

480
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,146
LET GO!

481
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:06,525
- No!
- Come here! You assholes!

482
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,360
Come here, you morons!

483
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,569
Police!

484
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:15,450
- What's up, runts?
- We wanna report a crime!

485
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,036
A crime against human kindness!

486
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,078
Look.

487
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,126
Where did you get that?

488
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,548
- See who that is?
- Fuck that shit.

489
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,216
No! You can't just go!

490
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,760
Why?? You can't go!!

491
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:34,845
WHY??

492
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,645
You sons of bitches!!!

493
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,689
Assholes.

494
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,692
You morons!

495
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,153
What did I say?

496
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:55,323
Gimme that phone, you idiot!
You give me the other one. Retards.

497
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:57,534
What was your master plan?

498
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:01,538
Go to Chino and get whacked?
Huh? Is that your big idea?

499
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,540
- Why do you shush me?
- Shut up!

500
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:06,251
Why do you have to
be the one with the plan?

501
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:07,419
Shut up!

502
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:18,722
- Where are you going?
- We need to find Estrella!

503
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:20,599
I need to tell her something!

504
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,226
- Wait!
- Wait!

505
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,317
Estrella!

506
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,320
She left Morrito all alone!

507
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,452
That's just mean.

508
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,876
Poor little dude.
He must be cold.

509
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:51,254
- We can't leave him.
- But first Estrella needs to...

510
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,964
First, Morro.

511
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,013
Let's cover him.

512
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,475
Cover him.

513
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,728
Give me a hand.

514
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,398
He's all stiff!

515
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,902
That's how it works. Hold him.

516
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:21,243
Wait! Where are we putting him?

517
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,262
They're burying me.

518
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,226
I'm cold.

519
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,524
Where?

520
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,486
All over.

521
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,576
No... where are
they burying you?

522
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:10,167
Oh.

523
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:13,128
Hold it, hold it!
Lemme check the...

524
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,010
How did you find us?

525
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,512
Morrito told me.

526
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,931
Right. Now he even talks?

527
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:30,645
Morrito is here. We tucked
him. After you left him.

528
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:34,858
- You heartless creature.
- You liar.

529
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,235
You heartless lying creature!

530
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,657
I've got something to tell you.

531
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:52,334
The video we saw...

532
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,299
Later.

533
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,096
We need to go see Chino.

534
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,769
Or they'll come
and they'll kill us all.

535
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,481
But first Morro.

536
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,233
Help me here.

537
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,860
Push this side.

538
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:31,039
Rest in peace Maxwell Alexander
Aureliano Villareal Mora Vazquez.

539
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,083
Mora Vazquez.

540
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,380
If we're gonna go to Chino...

541
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,633
We have to.

542
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,447
Estrella!

543
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,514
Give me...

544
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,021
We're so royally screwed...

545
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:40,066
Shut up. Don't talk to me
with that shit on your face.

546
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:42,527
It's war paint. Respect, man.

547
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,155
Right. I'm sure Chino will go:

548
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:49,743
“Don't touch them. They put
shoeshine on their mugs. They're deadly.”

549
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,369
Morons.

550
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:56,207
- Get that shit off.
- Uhm... with what?

551
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,501
With spit. Retards.

552
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,472
Move it!

553
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,579
Estrella...

554
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,668
The lady on the phone's vide...

555
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,839
What if I use my last wish
to make Chino disappear?

556
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,927
But what if it turns out wrong?

557
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,180
There are no wishes.

558
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:57,018
There's nothing.

559
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:01,022
Not even tigers.

560
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:06,152
We're all there is.

561
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,719
Those kids must be here already.

562
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,639
- Do you want us to go find them?
- No.

563
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:39,185
Motherfucking son of a
bitch. I'm not voting for him.

564
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:28,401
Ok, now you're
fucked, son of a...

565
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:33,907
- Lemme go, asshole!
- Tio! Leave him alone.

566
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:40,330
Where's the phone?

567
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,805
What's the password?

568
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,353
What's the password?!

569
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:13,530
That's the one, boss.
That's Caco's dragon.

570
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,074
Ok. Now we waste them?

571
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:21,995
No, Chino!!

572
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,015
We had an agreement, didn't we?

573
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:48,982
Get lost. I don't want
to see you again.

574
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,359
Where's my mom?

575
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:55,238
How the fuck would I know? Go!

576
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:15,466
Here's where they
killed my mom, isn't it?

577
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:19,137
Shine!

578
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,973
I need to know!

579
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,901
We need to go.

580
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,572
I swapped the
phone. But he'll notice.

581
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,751
What are you doing?

582
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,257
There's no wishes!
Don't be stupid!

583
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:12,398
I wish that your
scar disappears.

584
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:22,784
See?

585
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,370
There's nothing.

586
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,502
Shine... Shine!

587
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:37,547
Shine...

588
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,807
When you called me you knew
the password, didn't you, bitch?

589
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,997
Where are you??

590
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,018
Come out!

591
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:37,442
Where are you?

592
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:14,854
Where the fuck are you?

593
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:24,071
I'm gonna kill you, you slut!

594
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:12,370
Come out! I'm
gonna fucking kill you!

595
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,791
Estrella... come!

596
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,336
I'm gonna rip you
apart, you bitch!

597
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,424
I can see you, slut!

598
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,173
Mom...

599
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:47,006
I'm gonna kill
you, fucking bitch!

600
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:03,981
I can see you...

601
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,027
Open up, fucker! Open the door!

602
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,424
Goodbye, kiddo.

603
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:52,488
Goodbye...

604
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,772
Tigers are not afraid.

605
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:32,611
They went through
all the bad stuff.

606
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,830
And came out on the other side.

607
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:49,712
They are Kings...

608
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:59,096
of this Kingdom
of broken things.

609
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,771
Because we have to remember

610
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:11,192
we are Princes.

611
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,656
We are warriors.

612
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:22,244
And tigers.

613
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:28,459
And tigers are not afraid.

613
01:16:29,305 --> 01:17:29,820

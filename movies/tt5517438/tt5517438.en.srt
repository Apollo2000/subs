3
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:50,333
Why do I have to call her? For sex?

4
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,208
-She called me.
-She doesn't get angry?

5
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:55,667
They always do, but they get over it.

6
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,958
That never happens to me
with girls. Never.

7
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,958
That's because you have
a tendency to fall in love.

8
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:03,333
Yeah, but they get angry.

9
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:06,417
You have to learn the difference.
Sex is sex.

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,542
And?

11
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:11,833
You need a sixth sense with girls.
You have it or you don't.

12
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:13,500
And I don't.

13
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,583
Luis, you do have it.

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,667
-Don't touch me.
-You have it.

15
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,750
What's up, dude?

16
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,792
-Did you bring it?
-Yeah, we did.

17
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:29,875
Why do you want it?

18
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,792
-We're going to need it.
-Yeah, but for what?

19
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,292
-I'll tell you later.
-When?

20
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,667
-When Vero gets here.
-Isn't she at a wedding?

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,542
She was in the church,
but I told her to come.

22
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,417
-Did the lawyer call?
-I'll tell you later.

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,125
-Okay. It isn't serious, is it?
-Who dares?

24
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:45,917
-Let's go.
-Carlos.

25
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,542
From the other end.
Did you see that?

26
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,667
Luis...

27
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,292
-What?
-Not here.

28
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,458
Sorry.

29
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,792
Hello.

30
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,042
Why are you smoking?

31
00:02:07,917 --> 00:02:11,125
-Could you stop by your house?
-Yes, I've got it.

32
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,333
Does it fit?

33
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,292
Vero,

34
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,583
-I'm sorry you missed the wedding.
-They won't last long anyway.

35
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,083
What's up?

36
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,417
No one knows.
It's a mystery.

37
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,625
Here's the thing.

38
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,917
Natalia rang me this morning.

39
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,625
Bad news, we're screwed.

40
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,708
No way.

41
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:38,125
They're coming Monday.

42
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,417
Fuck.

43
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,083
-Now what?
-We have to see, but it's difficult.

44
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,292
-Well, then?
-It's ugly.

45
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,875
We'll have to make a decision.

46
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,875
Okay. How much will it cost us?

47
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,667
It isn't a matter of money.

48
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,750
And?

49
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,833
How long could we get?

50
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,542
No, we have to settle something.

51
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,292
No.

52
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,833
Yes. Yes, I'm sorry.

53
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm sorry.
I saw them, but I was in a meeting.

54
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,167
Yes, I'll call you later.

55
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,208
Yes, I'll call you back.

56
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:13,750
No, Chloe...

57
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,542
Fine. Okay, put her on.

58
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,167
The four of us.

59
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,250
All day.

60
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Yes.

61
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:24,583
Nothing, it's Murphy's Law.

62
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,333
You know how it is.

63
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:29,917
Of course.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes.

65
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:33,667
Okay, I don't want to hold you up.

66
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,708
Give my love to everyone.

67
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:37,833
Enjoy yourself.

68
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:40,583
I'll call the restaurant and cancel it.

69
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:41,667
Yes.

70
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,292
I'm really sorry, too.
I was looking forward to seeing you.

71
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,667
Yes, I know.
I know.

72
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,333
Yes, I'll send you a WhatsApp later
to see if you're awake, okay?

73
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,208
Big kiss, sweetheart.

74
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,417
Weren't you going to call the restaurant?

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,667
-To cancel the reservation.
-Yeah, yeah.

76
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,792
You notice everything.

77
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,167
Marcel, will you get me a beer, please?

78
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,333
Have you eaten?

79
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,792
No, I'm not hungry.

80
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,667
Sophie told me
to invite you to the concert.

81
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,750
It's on the 14th.

82
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,875
She's very nervous.

83
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,292
Fuck, poor kid.

84
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,667
What's she playing?

85
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,125
Chopin's Nocturne No. 2 in E-flat Major.

86
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,750
Difficult?

87
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:47,833
Not for her.

88
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,292
Does Chloe know?

89
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,750
When it's all over.

90
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,750
Hey, this isn't beer.

91
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,417
They're finished.

92
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,542
-They're not.
-You've had a lot already.

93
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,875
What?

94
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,875
-I don't want you drinking any more.
-Who are you, my father?

95
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,917
What do you say?

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,333
-It's no big deal.
-Oh, no?

97
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:17,167
-If it was you?
-I wouldn't care.

98
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,375
Yeah.

99
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,000
-Will I get you one?
-No, forget it.

100
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,125
I don't want beer or anything.

101
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,000
Luis, drink water.

102
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,292
-You too?
-Yes, me too.

103
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,417
-I don't want water.
-Open the bottle and drink.

104
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm not thirsty.

105
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,750
Will I open it for you
like you were a kid?

106
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,792
Will you fuck off?

107
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,833
-Yes, I'll fuck off.
-Please, fuck off.

108
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:52,875
Yes, Natalia.

109
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,708
No, he hasn't.

110
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,333
Yes, we're on it now.
Did you locate the IRS official?

111
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,583
Well, whatever it is, call me, okay?

112
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,500
All right, ciao.

113
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,167
-Well?
-He's due now.

114
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,583
And the other thing?

115
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,833
It seems okay.

116
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,792
Sign it.

117
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,083
Can someone help me?

118
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,125
-José?
-Yes.

119
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,500
-I'm Marcel. Pleased to meet you.
-Likewise.

120
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,667
-Did I speak to you on the phone?
-Yes, you did.

121
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,333
Well, well.

122
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:29,125
In the end, I took a taxi.

123
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,292
-What?
-Yes, it was 16.80.

124
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,958
-Okay.
-I'd have come by bus, but...

125
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,917
-Here's the change.
-No, it's okay.

126
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,208
-This is Luis.
-A pleasure.

127
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:46,000
-Hello, I'm Veronica.
-José Veiga.

128
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,625
-Carlos.
-I'm Carlos.

129
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:49,792
-How are you?
-A pleasure.

130
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,167
Likewise.

131
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,333
Please...

132
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:53,417
If I may.

133
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,833
José, what can I get you?

134
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:58,708
-Water.
-Sparkling?

135
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,167
No, still, please.
And no ice.

136
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,042
Anyone else want anything?

137
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,333
Excuse me.

138
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,833
Sorry, just a second.

139
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:10,542
-I'll leave the change here.
-No, don't worry about it.

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,125
Luis, stop.

141
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,042
First of all,
thank you for coming on a Saturday.

142
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,125
No, it's no problem.

143
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,875
I suppose you know the firm.

144
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,250
-Yes, of course.
-But you don't know who we are.

145
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,083
Well, the owners, I guess.

146
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,042
Founding partners, with equal shares.

147
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,333
Very good.

148
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:37,750
If you agree, I'll get to the point.
This is the contract.

149
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,375
There's one copy for you
and another for Human Resources.

150
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,417
Read it at your ease
and tell us what you think.

151
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,333
Is the amount acceptable?

152
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,042
It's very acceptable.

153
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,667
Ignore the budget.
It would be a bit more.

154
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,500
It can be negotiated each year
depending on new recruits.

155
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,458
May I ask how many people
are working in the department?

156
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,583
We don't have a mediation department.

157
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,625
You want to create one?

158
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,667
Yes, we think it's very necessary.

159
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,875
You too, I guess.

160
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,417
What's your objective for the department?

161
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,833
None.

162
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:28,958
-None?
-No.

163
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,958
Really, it's more of a long term approach.

164
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:33,958
Yes, we'd assure you
a ten-year permanent commitment.

165
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:37,792
-Ten years?
-It's on page six.

166
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,208
Are you interested, José?

167
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,708
Well, it's...

168
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:42,917
very attractive.

169
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,583
-When would I have to start?
-Today, immediately.

170
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,625
Now?

171
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,708
Yes, we need you to mediate for us.

172
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,000
If you do it well, the job's yours.

173
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,375
-And if not?
-We'll pay you for today.

174
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,500
That would be your fee.

175
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:07,333
It's quite a bit more than I charge.

176
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,250
For your trouble.

177
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,208
No, it's no trouble.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,250
All this for a mediation?
I don't understand.

179
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,458
This mediation is a bit special.

180
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,458
Special? Why?

181
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:27,750
Because you're doing it with us.

182
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,458
That's right.

183
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,208
-With the four of you?
-Yes.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,083
Well, in principle,
that needn't affect my work.

185
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,292
-No?
-No.

186
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,458
-Perfect.
-Great.

187
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:40,583
All right.

188
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,708
In that case, are you interested?

189
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,708
Yes, I'm interested.

190
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:50,042
I'll fill you in a little.

191
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,000
Do you mind if I take some notes?
Is it a problem?

192
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,500
-I need them.
-Of course you can.

193
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,875
We have a serious problem
with the Internal Revenue.

194
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,667
They've been investigating us,

195
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,375
but today we heard
they're coming after us.

196
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,958
-And?
-Special ops will be here Monday.

197
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:13,917
No, the crime squad will be here
to take computers and documentation,

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,333
so the situation is delicate.

199
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,875
Delicate, because we have
a lot of bread in Switzerland.

200
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,000
Black, I imagine.

201
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,667
Yes, black money.

202
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,458
With what they'll find here,

203
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:27,500
Financial Crimes
can probably justify requesting

204
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,958
a letter rogatory in Switzerland,
and we'll all be caught.

205
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,792
We've been shut in here all day
trying to resolve this situation

206
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,375
and we failed, so we called you.

207
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,167
We have to decide

208
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,708
which of the four of us
will go down for this.

209
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,542
What do you mean by "go down"?

210
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:53,167
Take the blame, and get us
out of the trial while he, or she,

211
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,250
goes to prison.

212
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,917
For how long?

213
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,125
-Seven years.
-Seven years.

214
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,833
And what are you thinking of doing?

215
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,375
All right.
Let's start there.

216
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,083
Do you know what this is?

217
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,375
It's a cryptographer.

218
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,583
It's very simple.
The cryptographer is synchronized

219
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,958
with the bank's server
that does data backup

220
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,125
and encrypts the IP
from where it's connected.

221
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,625
So we manage to get it to work
as if it were...

222
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,792
Okay, in plain English,
it's like a portable safe.

223
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,333
-Exactly.
-Okay.

224
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,875
We each have a personal account
in Switzerland with a password,

225
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,208
and that gadget links us directly
with those accounts

226
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:38,625
and changes the password
every five minutes.

227
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,250
If they're investigating us and one of us

228
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:46,042
makes a transfer to Spain,
the police will only go after him.

229
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,583
I see. And you're going
to make the transfer?

230
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,292
Yes.

231
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,083
Well, only one of us.

232
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,292
If the evidence
points clearly to one person,

233
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:00,958
there's nothing against the others
and the judge can go whistle.

234
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:04,208
Swiss justice won't grant access
to the accounts. They're opaque.

235
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:05,625
They don't exist.

236
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,458
And what will the one
who makes the transfer say?

237
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,833
He'll say that he tricked us,

238
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,375
that he kept a secret set of books.

239
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,583
-And he'll save the other three.
-And the firm.

240
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,167
And the firm.

241
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,875
Well...

242
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,792
Are you sure you want to do this?

243
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,417
Yes.

244
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,500
It's our only option.
We've looked at everything and...

245
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,667
So, to be specific,
what you want from me

246
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,958
is that I help you decide
who should make that transfer?

247
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,125
Please.

248
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,833
In that case, why the contract?

249
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:42,583
-Why not just pay me for the mediation?
-For two reasons.

250
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:46,458
Because, if you do it well,
you deserve the position,

251
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:52,250
and because we want you
to have an interest, too...

252
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,125
in the firm doing well.

253
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,958
Do you all have the same responsibility?

254
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:04,250
-Yes.
-Yes.

255
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,333
-Well...
-What?

256
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:09,583
-What we said earlier.
-Are we back to that again?

257
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:13,500
-We talked about it already.
-If you want, we'll go back to it.

258
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,875
We spent two hours discussing it.

259
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,292
-Tell him about it anyway.
-There's no point.

260
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,917
José, just one question.

261
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,375
Do you prefer to have
as much information as possible?

262
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,917
The more information, the better.

263
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,458
Go on, tell him.

264
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,875
All right, I'll tell him.
Of course I will.

265
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:35,042
Look... I was the one who started it all.

266
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,958
We had a deadline for a government tender.

267
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,708
I remember perfectly that I was exhausted.

268
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,375
I hadn't slept for days.

269
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,625
We were working... What?
Over 100 hours a week?

270
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,292
Some nights we even slept here.

271
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,625
My sister was visiting from Shanghai.

272
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,208
She lives there with her family.

273
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:58,333
She was only here three days,
but I had no time to see her.

274
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,375
I couldn't even take her to the airport.

275
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,333
She had to call me from the taxi
to tell me she was pregnant.

276
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,083
And suddenly I thought...

277
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:13,042
Of all the hours I've worked today,
how many are really mine?

278
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:15,583
Half?

279
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,125
Less, in fact.
Twenty-six minutes per hour.

280
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,208
José, I'm taxed at 56%.

281
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,500
Who owns the rest of the time? The state.

282
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,708
I didn't think it was fair.
Neither did they.

283
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It isn't so much the money.

284
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,250
It's the time.

285
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:40,667
All right, we earn more,
so we pay more. That's fine.

286
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,750
But the time we put in so as to earn more?

287
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,375
Where does it appear?

288
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,750
Where is it written off?

289
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,917
If things worked well in this country,
I wouldn't care. But nothing works.

290
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,208
And you decided to divert money.

291
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:58,625
Let's say I became
a bit more lax with the accounting.

292
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:03,667
First, it was just
with my share of the profits.

293
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,833
But they flipped when they saw
I was somehow making more.

294
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,292
They couldn't stand it.

295
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,458
Because that's how it is.

296
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:16,583
When you have a 50-foot yacht,
you want a 100-foot one.

297
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:17,958
No?

298
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,667
It's normal.

299
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,000
And when you have a house in Ibiza,
you want to add a pool.

300
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,083
No?

301
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:30,167
And if your daughter plays the piano,
it has to be a Steinway.

302
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:37,333
And once you have all those things,
it turns out they're not enough.

303
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,958
You want more and better of everything.

304
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,417
Isn't that right, Carlitos?

305
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,750
It never ends.

306
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,917
We talked about it

307
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,917
and decided between all of us,
as we've always done here.

308
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,375
-Between all of us.
-We're all equally responsible.

309
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes, equally responsible.

310
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,708
I guess you've thought
about having a draw.

311
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:04,500
-That's what I say, but...
-We said no.

312
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,458
-I'm not going to prison for a draw.
-Neither am I.

313
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,917
José, do you have children?

314
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,500
We all have something.

315
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,542
My father is in a residence.

316
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,958
I have a daughter, Sophie.
She's about to turn eight.

317
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:20,458
If I go to prison,
when I come out she'll be 15.

318
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,542
I'll have lost
the best years of her life.

319
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:27,833
I'm not willing to risk
my family's well-being in a draw.

320
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,333
It's a bit late.

321
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,750
What?

322
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,625
-Did you say something, Luis?
-Yes, I did.

323
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,083
We'll do as they say.
That's it.

324
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,500
But you're not very sure.

325
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,500
I think it's easier to have a draw.

326
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,458
Yes, but the easiest
isn't always the best.

327
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:47,500
I know, Marcel,
but I don't see any other option.

328
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,542
That's why José's here.

329
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,125
There are always options.

330
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,250
What are they?

331
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,417
Can I tell you a case?

332
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,875
Sure.

333
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,708
Imagine that two people come to you.

334
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:03,458
They have a problem.
A client has given them an orange.

335
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,083
-An orange.
-A delicious orange.

336
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,458
Like you never see now.

337
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,458
They both want that orange.

338
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:16,333
What would you do to settle that conflict
without either coming off badly?

339
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:19,375
-There's only one orange?
-Only one.

340
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,542
I'd cut it in two and give each a half.

341
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,083
Yes, but then both come off badly,

342
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,583
because each wants a whole orange,
not a half.

343
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,417
Then, what I'm saying...

344
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,500
-A draw.
-Of course,

345
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,708
but the winner gets an orange
and the loser gets nothing.

346
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,417
You could...

347
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:40,167
give one the orange

348
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,000
and promise the other
that he'll get the next one.

349
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,167
But the promise of an orange
isn't the same as an orange.

350
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,833
Like getting married isn't the same
as promising to get married.

351
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,292
Of course.

352
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:54,792
It isn't the same.

353
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,250
-I don't know. It's impossible.
-And if I say

354
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,750
there is a solution
by which neither comes off badly?

355
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,167
Any other ideas?

356
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:15,500
You give one the orange
and the other some compensation.

357
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,833
-Like what?
-A Rolex, a horse, whatever.

358
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,417
Very well.

359
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,083
But let's think a little.

360
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,958
The one with the orange
will feel badly off

361
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,375
because the other has a Rolex.

362
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:31,667
And the one with the Rolex, too,
because the other has an orange

363
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,833
that's so good
it had to be bought with a Rolex.

364
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,333
All right, then.

365
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,375
What would you do?

366
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:45,458
Ask them why they want the orange.

367
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:48,583
And what would you achieve with that?

368
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,625
Discover that one
wants the skin to make a cake,

369
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,500
and the other,
the pulp to make juice.

370
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,708
Come on, José, for fuck's sake.

371
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:02,292
You know they both
want the orange to make juice.

372
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,292
-Why?
-Because that's life.

373
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,000
We all want the same,

374
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,250
the only difference
is that some get it and others don't.

375
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,000
-You're right, Carlos.
-Of course I'm right.

376
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,167
You're right.

377
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,083
In this life, we all want the same.

378
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,417
Exactly the same.
You want the same as her,

379
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,208
you want the same as him,

380
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:25,125
and you want exactly the same as me.

381
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,750
Okay.

382
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,500
Yes, but who wants to go to prison?

383
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:38,625
I don't know. Maybe no one.
But isn't that why we're here?

384
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,833
You decide.

385
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,708
Do you accept the mediation?

386
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:48,167
All right, I accept the mediation.

387
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,125
Very well, let's get down to it.

388
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,167
We'll probably be here for several hours,

389
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,125
so this is the time
to make calls and so on.

390
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,417
I have to make one call.

391
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,583
Yes, of course.

392
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:03,542
-I presume I can't smoke here.
-No. On the terrace.

393
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,000
He's quite a character.

394
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,667
I think he's very normal.

395
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:23,708
Too normal.

396
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,250
No...

397
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,083
Softly, softly, catchee monkey.

398
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:30,750
You'll see that this guy...

399
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,375
<i>Cell phones off, please.</i>

400
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,375
The lawyer has to be able to call.

401
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,083
Leave one on the table,
with the sound off.

402
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:40,208
-No one will call at this time.
-Carlos...

403
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,208
All right, it's off.

404
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:44,292
Thank you.

405
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:48,875
You should know there are
three basic rules in mediation.

406
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,958
First, you must be here willingly.

407
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:55,417
So if anyone feels uncomfortable,
they can leave at any time.

408
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
That includes me.

409
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:59,833
Second, it's essential to listen.

410
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:02,958
And for that, you must respect each other.

411
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,083
You're here because you have a problem.

412
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,375
But the problem
isn't the person beside you.

413
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:11,125
That person is part of the solution,
so you must listen to him.

414
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,458
And third, I have no stake in this.

415
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:17,125
I support no one.
I decide nothing.

416
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,333
I only ease communication.

417
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,625
I make you think.

418
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:23,667
You are the only ones
who can take decisions.

419
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,750
Okay?

420
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,292
So we'll be here as long as necessary,

421
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:32,125
until you agree which of you
will make that transfer.

422
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,625
Agreed?
That is where the mediation ends.

423
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:36,875
Is that clear?

424
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,208
Yes.

425
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:40,292
Yes.

426
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:42,167
Okay.

427
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,000
Did I see a chessboard earlier?

428
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:45,833
Yes.

429
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,917
Can you bring it, please?

430
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll get it.

431
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:59,708
Each of you will choose
a piece from the board.

432
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:01,208
-Whichever we want?
-Yes.

433
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,833
As long as you identify with it.

434
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,583
Identified how? Personally?
In our work? How?

435
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,833
As a person, in the firm,
as you wish.

436
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,583
Fucking spiritually.

437
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Okay.

438
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,542
Veronica has the knight,

439
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:23,708
Marcel, the white rook,
Carlos, the black rook,

440
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,667
and Luis is the bishop.

441
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,542
Now I want you to explain,

442
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,000
using the figure,
what each one does in the firm.

443
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,708
Well, I chose the black--

444
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,833
Wait, wait.
Talk about what the bishop does.

445
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,750
But Luis is the bishop.

446
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,750
Exactly.

447
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,625
All right.

448
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,458
The bishop...

449
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,250
The bishop moves forward.

450
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,875
He always wants to move forward.
He's a free spirit.

451
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:50,083
And he's also our personal genius.

452
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,167
He's our CTO.

453
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,417
Chief technical officer.

454
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,250
He coordinates the engineering teams.
He supervises their work.

455
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:02,833
And a long time ago he invented
the products we sell here today.

456
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:05,333
And only he really understands
what the fuck we sell.

457
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:09,625
Anyone want to add anything?
The bishop himself?

458
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,000
He defined him very well.

459
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,833
Well, Marcel, can you explain
what the black rook does?

460
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,125
The black rook?

461
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,500
The black rook
is always close to the bishop.

462
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,750
He protects him,

463
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,917
and he tells him
when he has to move forward.

464
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,167
Well, the clients set the move.

465
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,000
He knows what they want.
He knows what they'd be willing to buy.

466
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,750
He reads people very well.
That's why he's head of accounts.

467
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:37,167
He's the one who takes
the clients sailing, golfing.

468
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,250
He invites them
to Michelin-starred restaurants.

469
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,542
He makes sure they're happy.

470
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Is that so?

471
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,083
Basically, yes.

472
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,958
Veronica, what about the white rook?

473
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,583
The white rook is the CEO.

474
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:59,667
-Excuse me?
-The managing director.

475
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,833
-He's in charge of everyone, right?
-No, not exactly.

476
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:05,917
The important decisions
are taken by all of us.

477
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,917
But he sets out the path.

478
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,958
His area is strategic thinking,
the long term.

479
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:13,667
He has the vision.

480
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,875
He knows where we have to go
in the future.

481
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,083
He's always two steps ahead.

482
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,917
And in the new technologies,
that's everything.

483
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,750
It's like he had a crystal ball.

484
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,708
-But he can't make a mistake.
-He shouldn't.

485
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:28,667
-It's a difficult position.
-It is.

486
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:33,458
Well, he's also the one
that the clients know.

487
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:39,667
As a kid, he went to school with them,
went on vacation.

488
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:44,542
If you have to know everything,
I think it's an important detail.

489
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:51,292
You invite the clients to dinner,
and they invite him.

490
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,083
It's a bit...

491
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,542
And the knight?

492
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:02,250
-The knight...
-She's an essential piece,

493
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,333
because she's different.

494
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:06,542
She moves with a different logic
on the board,

495
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:09,417
and she runs rings around us.

496
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
She's our CFO.
She controls the numbers.

497
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,458
Well, she controlled them.

498
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,667
Excuse me, Carlos.
What do you mean?

499
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:25,458
A year ago, Vero set up
a little hotel with a friend.

500
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:28,875
And, logically,
that requires dedication,

501
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,583
and we've had to get used
to operating without her.

502
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,833
-You're not serious.
-That's how it is.

503
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,833
I said that you were free
to look for a replacement.

504
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,125
Did you do it? No.
So I wasn't doing it so badly.

505
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,417
I'm at all the meetings,
in all the e-mails.

506
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,708
I'm here every week.

507
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,667
I wouldn't say "all."

508
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,917
-He isn't always here either.
-Hey, stop.

509
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,625
It's no big deal.
You're not that necessary.

510
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,333
-What do you know?
-Come on,

511
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:56,792
anyone can do accounting.

512
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,083
That isn't so.

513
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:01,250
And eating and going whoring
with clients is expert work.

514
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,042
Without me, we'd lose clients.
Without you, no.

515
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,458
-I could do your job.
-And I, yours.

516
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,625
Carlos, you have no idea
about accounting.

517
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,375
And Vero knows about whores?
Do you?

518
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,250
You're a pig.

519
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,542
José, can she insult me like that?

520
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,833
Yes.

521
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:20,667
She can insult you. You can insult her.
You can all insult each other.

522
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,292
And I can leave
if you don't respect each other,

523
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,583
as I said earlier.

524
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:27,708
What do you say?

525
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,792
I'm sorry.

526
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,292
Veronica, do you want
to talk about what you feel?

527
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:41,208
How can you say anyone could do my job?
You know it isn't true.

528
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,167
You're right.

529
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,500
We're all important
in one way or another, okay?

530
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:56,167
But what if we leave that aside
and concentrate on what matters?

531
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,250
Time is short.

532
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,625
We're going to be objective.

533
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:04,375
We all know that there's one person
who'd have it much easier in prison.

534
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:05,750
And that's you, Vero.

535
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,083
Me?

536
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,625
-Me.
-Yes, you.

537
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,167
I've been investigating.

538
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,125
You don't say.
And what did you find?

539
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:18,208
-Really, there's no comparison.
-There isn't?

540
00:30:18,292 --> 00:30:20,167
No, men's prisons are terrible.

541
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,792
There are rapes, gangs,
there's violence...

542
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:25,917
It's horrible. There's no comparison
with women's prisons.

543
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,417
-No, that's true.
-You, too?

544
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Everyone knows that, Vero.
Marcel...

545
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:35,250
-Tell her.
-It's true.

546
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,333
Yes, yes.
There's absolutely no comparison.

547
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,917
No, none at all.

548
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,625
You may not know that, in Spain,

549
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,625
94% of the prison population
is male.

550
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,292
Did you know that?

551
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,667
What does that mean?

552
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,583
That the prisons here
are made by and for men.

553
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,667
And the whole penal system
is designed by men.

554
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,667
Suppose I'm sent to a women's center.

555
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,583
You know how many
women's prisons there are?

556
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:05,000
Take a guess.
Thirty, fifteen,

557
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,417
-twenty... How many?
-Ten, I don't know.

558
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,667
Three.

559
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,458
Only three.

560
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:13,125
And as my family isn't in Ávila,
or Seville, or Madrid,

561
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:16,208
they'd have a long journey
for a 90-minute visit.

562
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,417
The first year, fantastic, great.

563
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:21,792
The other six, no one will visit me.

564
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,625
But it could be worse.

565
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:28,000
I could be sent to a women's block
in a men's prison.

566
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,333
Those really shitty blocks.

567
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:34,500
It's like being in a prison
within a prison.

568
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:38,167
They're all on antidepressants
or tranquilizers.

569
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,208
Don't laugh.

570
00:31:41,292 --> 00:31:44,500
As well, men are separated
by crime, women aren't.

571
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:47,583
As there isn't enough space,
they're all put in together.

572
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:52,125
And you're right.
My cellmates won't rape me, Carlos.

573
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:55,417
In the women's prisons,
the wardens do that.

574
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,583
A group of them, in exchange
for nothing and with total impunity.

575
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,667
-Vero...
-Leave me alone.

576
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:36,208
Let me tell you something.

577
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:40,917
If we didn't find anyone to replace you,
it's because I didn't want to.

578
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,375
They don't know,

579
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:47,417
but I told Human Resources
to stop looking.

580
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,792
-Why?
-Why do you think?

581
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't know.

582
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,958
I don't want you to leave.
I want you to stay.

583
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,625
It didn't seem like that just now.

584
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,083
I won't let it be you.

585
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,167
Yes?

586
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,458
Is there any news?

587
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,625
Okay, I'll put him on.

588
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,208
Yes, Natalia.

589
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,875
-Are you all right?
-I'm great.

590
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:25,125
-Do you want a break?
-No, do you?

591
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,875
This is a fuck-up.

592
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,875
Okay, okay, okay. Ciao.

593
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:45,625
What's happened?

594
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:50,167
They're looking for the IRS official
who's doing the report for the judge.

595
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,250
Yes...

596
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,917
The problem is that
by looking for him,

597
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,708
they've set off alarm bells.

598
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:59,583
-What does that mean?
-They could be here any minute.

599
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,083
-What? Now?
-Yes.

600
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:03,167
-You mean here?
-Shit.

601
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,417
Come on, let's get going.
We have to sort this out now.

602
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,583
Let's focus.

603
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,292
Why don't we take a vote?

604
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,500
A vote, just like that?

605
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,542
It's a fairly regular procedure,
if you all agree.

606
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:18,958
Everyone writes on a piece of paper
the name of the person

607
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:20,708
they think is dispensable.

608
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:24,583
We talk about it, discuss it.
As you said, we vote,

609
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,875
and whoever gets most votes
makes the transfer.

610
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:28,167
Can we leave our paper blank?

611
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,958
-No, no.
-Why not?

612
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:31,333
Because all of us have to participate.

613
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:32,667
Fuck, it's...

614
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,500
What?

615
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:38,250
You're always the same.

616
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,875
If I do more, if you do more, if...

617
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,125
I don't think that's what's important.

618
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,292
What would be important for you, Luis?

619
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:59,375
-It doesn't matter.
-No, no, it matters to me.

620
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:03,875
I wouldn't pick anyone
for what they do or don't do here.

621
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:07,167
I don't think that's a criterion.
That's all.

622
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,958
No one said this was easy,

623
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:11,500
but we have to take a decision, Luis.

624
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,708
Look at my hand.

625
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:18,875
I have a gun.

626
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:22,250
Imagine I'm a murderer
and I'm going to kill someone.

627
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,542
And I ask you, "Who should die?"

628
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:29,625
I only want to kill one,
but if you don't choose anyone,

629
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,208
I'll kill everyone.

630
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,833
There's no option.
You have to choose.

631
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,083
Think of a name.

632
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,750
You only have to think of one,
you don't have to tell me.

633
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,167
All right?

634
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,125
Do you think you've made
the correct decision?

635
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:50,792
Given the circumstances, obviously.

636
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,917
Good. Take the gun, please.

637
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,833
It's a game.

638
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,208
Take it.

639
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:03,500
Good.

640
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,792
Imagine I'm the person you've thought of.

641
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:08,958
Aim at me.

642
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:16,833
I'll ask you for the last time.
Are you sure of your decision?

643
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,417
Shoot.

644
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,917
Shoot.

645
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,083
He can't.

646
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,292
I can't what? Huh?

647
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:33,375
Do something like this.

648
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,542
-I can't do what?
-Do something like this.

649
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:39,167
-What can I not do, Carlos?
-Don't kill me. Don't shoot.

650
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,417
-Come on, you can't do it.
-Because you say so?

651
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,083
-You can't shoot.
-And you can?

652
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:47,667
You can?

653
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,167
Yes, I'd shoot,

654
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,458
and so would they.

655
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,417
No, no, no.

656
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:01,625
What he says isn't true.

657
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,708
-What do you mean?
-No.

658
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:06,833
You're wrong, Carlos.

659
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:11,042
I'm not as good as you think.
I'd shoot, too.

660
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,625
I'd shoot, too.

661
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:19,667
Each one will state their case,
and then we'll take a vote.

662
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,208
Do you all agree?

663
00:37:21,292 --> 00:37:22,292
Good.

664
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,208
Do you mind starting, Carlos?

665
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:27,917
Okay, I'll start.

666
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:33,083
That game with the gun
got me thinking a bit.

667
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:37,792
Luis, do you know
why I said what I said before?

668
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:41,000
-Tell me.
-It's nothing personal, you know.

669
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:45,833
Look, imagine you've got the gun
and you're thinking of me, okay?

670
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,708
That means you've voted for me.

671
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:52,167
Vero and Marcel agree,
so I'm the one going to prison.

672
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:55,333
The day of the trial arrives,

673
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:58,167
you turn up, declare and say
you knew nothing about it.

674
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,292
-So you commit perjury.
-Like them.

675
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:03,458
Yes, like them.
But they're more...

676
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:06,583
more practical than you.

677
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:08,208
Not you.

678
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:10,458
You'd find it harder
to live with something like that.

679
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:12,792
Think about it.

680
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,500
It isn't easy, is it?

681
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,708
They put me in prison,

682
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:22,875
and at first it's fine because I'm tough.

683
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:26,167
I find my place in prison.
Or at least I tell you that.

684
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:29,167
On the fourth or fifth visit,
you think I look bad,

685
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,750
different, I don't know, a bit changed.

686
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:34,542
You think something's happened
but you daren't ask,

687
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:38,125
because you're already
driving yourself crazy wondering,

688
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:41,292
"Christ, how could
I have fucked up his life?"

689
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:46,417
And one day you come,
and I look really bad,

690
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,083
seriously bad, terrible.
I'm unhinged,

691
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,917
I've lost weight, like when
we were studying, remember?

692
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:57,583
And, one day, you stop coming.
You can't bear to see me anymore.

693
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,667
That's where it all gets fucked.

694
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,792
You can't stop thinking about me,

695
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:07,125
about how I am, if I've eaten,
if I've been beaten up.

696
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,625
You can't concentrate on anything.

697
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,417
You can't sleep.

698
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,042
The insomnia starts,
the nightmares, the pills.

699
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,958
I've already got insomnia, Carlos.

700
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:20,958
I've already got it,
and the pills help me, you know?

701
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:23,250
Yes, of course I know.

702
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,000
The question is, how much longer
can you last like that?

703
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,792
Until when?
Until you do something stupid?

704
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,125
Would I be better in prison?

705
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:39,417
Well, in prison
you'd have an easy conscience,

706
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,000
because you'd have saved all of us,
and all of us

707
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:43,875
would be indebted to you.

708
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,292
You know I'm right.

709
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,750
I'd stick it out, Carlos.

710
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,500
I'd stick it out.

711
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,125
Even you don't believe that.

712
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:02,333
Know why I know that?

713
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,583
Because if you really believed it,
you wouldn't insist on a draw.

714
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:10,750
You want a draw
so as not to point to anyone,

715
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:13,958
because you can't.

716
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,083
Luis, think about it.

717
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,333
Seriously?

718
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,792
You're seriously saying
I have to go to prison

719
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:33,417
because I'm the only one
who'd feel remorse?

720
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,292
I don't agree.

721
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,833
-With what?
-With it being Luis.

722
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:45,417
Come on, you know I'm right.

723
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:48,875
And as well, you're going to vote for him.

724
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:51,083
Luis, he's voting for you.

725
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,875
Carlos, have you finished your arguments?

726
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:58,292
-Yes.
-Luis, do you want to add anything?

727
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:00,375
Luis, not here.

728
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,000
-Luis...
-Have you got a light?

729
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,042
Luis, you can't.

730
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,000
-You can't.
-Like fuck I can't!

731
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,125
Like fuck!

732
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,500
I was saying that I see it differently.

733
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:14,708
Of course.

734
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:17,375
Now, what you said was very interesting.

735
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,458
Thank you.

736
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:22,250
But I think that all of us
on the outside will feel bad.

737
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,417
Yes, especially you.

738
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,292
-Will you let me speak?
-Yes, of course.

739
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:30,000
-May I speak?
-Yes, go ahead.

740
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:38,042
I think we have to be less selfish
and think more about the firm.

741
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,000
What's best for the firm?

742
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,542
Earlier, you said you were a fighter.

743
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:45,958
I agree.

744
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:50,250
Seeing you fight is something.
You're like a Roman gladiator.

745
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:55,292
And I think you'd be the one
who could hold out best in prison.

746
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:59,917
But out here, in the firm,
that's irrelevant.

747
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,958
You're here because Luis brought you.

748
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:07,542
But, really, everything is hard for you.

749
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,250
You're always bluffing.
I'm embarrassed to say it,

750
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:12,708
but you always look

751
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:15,917
as if you're about to arrive,
but you don't.

752
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,208
And you're wondering
when we'll realize that, really,

753
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:22,917
you're a fraud. Or not?

754
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,750
Because we think better.

755
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:30,375
Our brains work faster,
but we're aware of everything.

756
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:33,417
You're here as head of accounts

757
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,500
because you have to keep people happy,
and you're great at that.

758
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:39,458
You're an expert.

759
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:42,917
But when our clients need something,
they call me.

760
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:47,375
You're here to play the clown,
to tell a joke,

761
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:51,542
to pay the restaurant
with the firm's credit card.

762
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:53,292
Anyone can do that.

763
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,083
We can all do it.

764
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,542
-I could do your job.
-You?

765
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,708
Do it. If they let you.
I don't care about being CEO.

766
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,458
Don't make me laugh.

767
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,750
-You all asked me.
-You'd never give it up.

768
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:12,667
-It's your toy.
-No, it's my responsibility.

769
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,958
Running everything isn't easy,
and you're not up to it.

770
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:18,125
I work more hours than anyone.

771
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,500
I plan, coordinate, detect errors,
hire people,

772
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:21,583
I fire people.

773
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,542
Now you'll say firing people
has merit, too.

774
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,000
You do it, Charly.

775
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,958
He's right and you know it.

776
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,167
Are you not sick of saving his ass?

777
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,167
I say what I think, if you don't mind.

778
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,208
-Yeah, what you think.
-Yes.

779
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:42,625
Hasn't he humiliated you enough?

780
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:44,833
You're pathetic.

781
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:46,333
At least I don't invent calls.

782
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,000
You really think no one knows?

783
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:52,917
Putting on a show with imaginary calls
so everyone can hear you.

784
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:56,583
If you have no one to call, don't call.

785
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,833
You're not pathetic.
You're ridiculous.

786
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:04,042
So, you couldn't run this even for a day.

787
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,167
Shall we continue?

788
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:09,833
Do you remember Susana?

789
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:14,083
Redhead, big tits...

790
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,625
Anyone else know
that Chloe nearly divorced Marcel?

791
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,917
Didn't know that, did you?

792
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:42,042
Yes, she was going to go back
to Montreal and take Sophie with her.

793
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,375
But I sorted it out.

794
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:48,167
I spoke to the intern.
I paid her to keep quiet.

795
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,792
I got her a job far, far away...

796
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:52,583
and I spoke to Chloe.

797
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:55,500
I told her I was the one
who'd screwed the intern.

798
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,625
Do you remember?
Or not?

799
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,708
Tell me, did I sort it out?

800
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:05,458
Did your wife divorce you?

801
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:08,667
Is your daughter living
thousands of miles away?

802
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:10,833
Don't you remember?

803
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,333
There he is.

804
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:21,458
There you have him.
There's your CEO.

805
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:24,375
The guy in charge,
the one who deals with things.

806
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:29,708
Do I have to remind you
how we got the first loan for the firm?

807
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:32,833
The bank guy shit himself
when I went to see him.

808
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:34,417
Is that right or not?

809
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,500
Don't you remember?

810
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:39,958
Marcel,

811
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:42,333
you may be smarter
and come from a better family,

812
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:44,333
but I'm the one with bigger balls.

813
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:47,000
Come on, what is it?

814
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,667
Does your memory fail you
when it suits you?

815
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,292
You're mistaken.

816
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,958
The one with Alzheimer's is your father.

817
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,792
-Fuck you!
-Carlos! Carlos!

818
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,292
All right, all right, stop!
Are you crazy?

819
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,542
-Fuck.
-Luis...

820
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:12,833
Christ.

821
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:15,250
Sit down, sit down.

822
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:20,417
Don't leave. We haven't finished
the mediation. Please.

823
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:23,875
José...

824
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:28,250
-Listen...
-You don't have to leave.

825
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:34,667
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Forgive me. Okay?

826
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,833
I apologize.

827
00:46:37,917 --> 00:46:38,917
Why?

828
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:44,542
This has never happened to us.
It won't happen again.

829
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:48,292
José, we're tired.
We've been shut in here for hours,

830
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,750
and we lost control.
I'm really sorry.

831
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:52,875
I'm sorry, too.

832
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:56,500
You have my word, José.
You have our word.

833
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:57,958
Please, don't go.

834
00:46:58,042 --> 00:47:02,250
You don't need mediation.
You need another kind of work.

835
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,083
We do need it.
We must finish this, please.

836
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:12,417
Do you all give your word
that it won't happen again?

837
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:14,625
Yes.

838
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,875
Yes.

839
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,458
What's so funny?

840
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:39,042
I always come off worst.

841
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:43,083
I always come off worst.

842
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,625
Do you know what I'm remembering, Marcel?

843
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,167
When we presented
our first software in Las Vegas, 2003.

844
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:06,542
I didn't sleep a wink that night
and I was preparing the presentation.

845
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:10,417
When I fell asleep in the morning
and you called and woke me up,

846
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:15,458
"Luis, swear to me
you didn't fall asleep,

847
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:18,708
or in half a minute
you'll be in the hall."

848
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:21,875
And I said, "Yes, I'll be right down."

849
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,083
Shit. So as not to go.

850
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,542
We were all so nervous.

851
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:31,500
We were taking a gamble,
it was our big moment.

852
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:34,667
I had my white iBook,
I remember it perfectly.

853
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,792
Everything was ready.

854
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:40,125
Mr. Mike Owen willing to listen.

855
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,417
Everything was ready except...

856
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,542
-The charger.
-The charger. Shit.

857
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:49,375
I fucked up, I forgot the charger.
I was in shock.

858
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,292
I couldn't even think.

859
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:54,250
But the machine worked.
The team worked.

860
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:57,917
Vero gave me a one-milligram Lexatin.
Remember?

861
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,875
I think it was my first tranquilizer.

862
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:03,917
And Carlos entertained the American
with a joke about a bear...

863
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,792
Remember? The gay bear.

864
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:09,125
-You don't come here to hunt.
-You don't come here to hunt, exactly.

865
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:13,167
And Marcel found a charger.

866
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,583
We did it, we sold the software.
That's where everything started.

867
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,417
At that moment,

868
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,792
I remember thinking,

869
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,333
"These people are my family."

870
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:35,000
Well, I don't know if you know,

871
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,625
but that night...

872
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:40,792
I got a call with the news
that my father had died.

873
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:48,042
Luis, I didn't know about your father.

874
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:54,833
Sometimes it seems
like we don't even know each other.

875
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:01,500
The family is full of shit,
right, Carlos?

876
00:50:05,542 --> 00:50:07,667
How the story has changed. Shit.

877
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:16,833
Okay. We need to resume.

878
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:19,417
-Yes.
-Okay.

879
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,667
Well, so far we've had arguments
from Marcel and from Carlos.

880
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,958
Carlos has proposed Luis,
and Marcel has proposed Carlos.

881
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,458
We're just missing you two.

882
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,292
Would you start, Veronica?

883
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,000
Yes, I will.

884
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:51,875
Shall we do it together?

885
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:54,625
-Together?
-We'll try to be more objective,

886
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,750
more rational, okay?

887
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,958
This is getting out of control.

888
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:01,500
-Let's see.
-Okay.

889
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:04,500
Point in favor, point against.

890
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:07,708
-Binary code.
-Exactly.

891
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:09,292
I don't understand.

892
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:11,667
Binary code only has zeros and ones.

893
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,333
More black pieces
mean more reasons to go to prison.

894
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:15,750
-Exactly.
-Okay.

895
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:17,625
Some criteria have emerged.

896
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:21,667
One, who could cope best with the guilt
of sending someone to prison?

897
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,208
-Great criterion.
-But it has come up.

898
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:25,417
Me, for example.

899
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,375
Could I live happily
if one of you went to prison?

900
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:33,583
Yes.

901
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:35,833
Marcel...

902
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:38,042
Marcel, too.

903
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:40,833
A point in favor.
Carlos?

904
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:42,000
As well.

905
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:43,667
As well. Yes.

906
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:45,583
And you?

907
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,167
Second criterion.

908
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,792
Who is really necessary to this firm?

909
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,750
I... Well, I...

910
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,708
I offered to leave
because of the hotel, so...

911
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:12,667
I'm not very necessary.

912
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,250
Besides honest.

913
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,458
Point against.

914
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,042
-Marcel.
-Marcel...

915
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:23,958
He brings clients, doesn't he?
And without clients...

916
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,500
Yeah.

917
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,542
-You don't bring clients.
-But I look after them.

918
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:32,250
-It's not the same.
-I think it's just as important.

919
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,208
-But it's zero or one.
-I think it's zero.

920
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:38,125
So do I. Point against.

921
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:41,000
-And the clients come for my ideas.
-Yes.

922
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:44,125
No, no, no, no.
Let's be objective.

923
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,542
When did you last create
something we could sell?

924
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:49,292
Look, Carlos, my work takes time, too.

925
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,625
-How much? Four years? Five years?
-Carlos, come on!

926
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:56,083
Third, the family.

927
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,042
Well, we all have families.

928
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,542
But who is really needed by them?

929
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,833
I'm not.

930
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,625
My father could die any time.
With Alzheimer's you never know.

931
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:23,125
I'd like to be with him
as long as possible.

932
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,625
Yeah, yeah, a point in your favor.

933
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:36,667
Hey, I'm sorry.

934
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,292
When do you visit him, Carlos?

935
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:48,583
What?

936
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,333
When do you visit your father?

937
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,208
When I can.

938
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,208
He thinks you visit him every week.

939
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:03,542
-I said, when I can.
-No.

940
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:06,292
-No, what?
-It's not true.

941
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:07,708
What the fuck do you know?

942
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,083
What's his nurse called?

943
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:14,333
I don't know.
They keep changing them.

944
00:54:16,667 --> 00:54:18,125
What are you doing?

945
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,292
Her name is Rosa.

946
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,750
She's been with him for three years.

947
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:26,208
You visited my father without telling me?

948
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:28,417
You were to tell me when you went,
and you didn't.

949
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,500
-I'm his son.
-Yeah?

950
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:31,292
-Yes.
-Carlos, please.

951
00:54:31,375 --> 00:54:32,792
I spent every Christmas in your house.

952
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:33,875
-Not anymore.
-Why?

953
00:54:33,958 --> 00:54:35,250
-Because.
-Are you going to hit me?

954
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:37,500
Hit me again?

955
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,875
You know he often thinks I'm you?

956
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,375
As if I were you.

957
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:50,208
Triple draw.

958
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:53,625
Yes, triple draw.

959
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:59,583
Well, Veronica, Luis,
have you finished your argument?

960
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:01,250
Yes.

961
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:03,833
If there's nothing more to add,
we'll proceed to the vote.

962
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:05,167
Very well. Let's go.

963
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:08,417
-It really suits you.
-It's what we said.

964
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,458
-What?
-You did a good job.

965
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:12,000
-Clever bastard.
-I did nothing.

966
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,208
-Right, she does it for you.
-Does what?

967
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:16,875
-What did you do in the washroom?
-What?

968
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:18,167
Will you screw her again?

969
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,917
Wait... What are you saying?

970
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,375
-Are you two involved again?
-No.

971
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:28,583
For God's sake,
they never stopped being involved.

972
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,000
Still, Vero?

973
00:55:30,917 --> 00:55:32,167
That's still going on?

974
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:36,250
Wait, wait, this changes things a lot.

975
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,208
They're together.

976
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:40,958
No, that's all in the past.
I wasn't even married.

977
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:44,250
Yeah, sure. You know what he told her
so she'd have an abortion?

978
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,333
Shut up.

979
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:48,500
It wasn't the right time,
the firm was more important.

980
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:51,958
-Shut up!
-Do you know what he said to me?

981
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:55,333
That you were the kind of girl
to screw but not to have kids with.

982
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:56,458
No, that's not how it was.

983
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:03,750
And how was it?

984
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:06,875
-It was your decision.
-Mine.

985
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:08,292
You don't say.

986
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:12,083
-Do we have to talk about it now?
-Yes, why not?

987
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:14,042
I'd like to talk about it.

988
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:17,375
So you never asked me to do it?

989
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:18,833
We did it together.

990
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,542
So you never told me
you wanted a partner, an equal,

991
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,583
someone as committed to the firm as you?

992
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,458
I sacrificed myself for you, Marcel.

993
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:29,750
Yes, I gave everything for this firm.

994
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,042
You said, "This isn't the time,"

995
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,708
but within a year, you'd married
and had your daughter.

996
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,375
Very coherent. Very coherent.

997
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:40,958
-Circumstances were different.
-And?

998
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:42,333
-It was a different time.
-Why?

999
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,958
You know perfectly well.

1000
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:50,375
You loved her and not me.

1001
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:55,958
That's how you explain it. Right?

1002
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,833
You tell me.

1003
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:04,208
Chloe wanted to be a mother,
to have a family.

1004
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:07,292
And you were more ambitious.

1005
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:12,125
-You had no maternal instinct.
-That'll do. Forget it.

1006
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,500
-You wanted...
-Forget it. You've said it all.

1007
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:16,000
Can we finish this now?

1008
00:57:16,917 --> 00:57:19,667
-If you are all in agreement.
-We are.

1009
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,333
Are you in agreement?

1010
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,583
-Yes.
-Very well.

1011
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:26,125
Marcel?

1012
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,417
Yes.

1013
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,875
In that case,
each one of you take a paper,

1014
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:34,292
put the name
of one of the four of you

1015
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:35,667
and give it to me.

1016
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:20,083
I'll now read the result.

1017
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:23,625
"Luis."

1018
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,458
I maintain what I said.

1019
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:29,875
"Marcel."

1020
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:34,250
I'm sorry.

1021
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:38,792
"Luis."

1022
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,917
I said it.

1023
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:45,417
"Marcel."

1024
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,958
Well, we have a draw
between Luis and Marcel,

1025
00:58:57,042 --> 00:58:58,625
with two votes each.

1026
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:23,250
Yes, Natalia.

1027
00:59:26,167 --> 00:59:27,750
No, not yet.

1028
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,375
We're working on it, Natalia.

1029
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:35,042
Natalia, I said not yet!

1030
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:50,417
-Well, it's between you two.
-Yeah? Fuck that.

1031
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,708
-That's the result.
-Now what?

1032
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:53,958
Now what?

1033
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:57,792
If you want,
you two could have a draw.

1034
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:00,750
-A draw is no good.
-It's different now.

1035
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:02,333
Now it is?

1036
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:04,958
We've gotten nowhere.

1037
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:07,292
I don't agree.

1038
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:08,500
It's like at the beginning.

1039
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,667
No, there were four candidates
to make that transfer.

1040
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:15,250
And now, through a system
you all agreed on,

1041
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:16,583
there are only two.

1042
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,792
So we've made some progress.

1043
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Luis, have you ever thought

1044
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,000
what you'd be doing
if we hadn't set up this?

1045
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:34,708
If we hadn't met,
all this wouldn't exist.

1046
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:37,042
Honestly,

1047
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,667
would you be doing well?

1048
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,375
The rest of us would.

1049
01:00:42,292 --> 01:00:44,792
I'm sure the rest of us would.
But you?

1050
01:00:46,417 --> 01:00:49,917
-I don't know.
-Sure, you may be a genius,

1051
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,083
and you had a brilliant idea
that made millions for us.

1052
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:54,542
Yes, a lot of money.

1053
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:57,833
Okay, but that's it.
Now what?

1054
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:00,000
Now what will you do?

1055
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:03,833
You've got no initiative.
You're pulled along.

1056
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:07,750
You're 40, and you've got
kids of 20 under you

1057
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:10,167
-who run rings round you.
-So what are you saying?

1058
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,125
You were indispensable,
but not anymore.

1059
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:16,708
The company is about to take off,
and we have to shed weight.

1060
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:21,500
At any minute, we can be bought out
for heaps of money,

1061
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:23,833
and I'm the only one who can pull it off.

1062
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:27,000
All you have to do is relax

1063
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,083
and pick up the chips

1064
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:31,875
while we take care of this.

1065
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:39,125
The question is,
how many chips do you want?

1066
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:43,083
What do you mean?

1067
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:47,625
What do you want
for spending seven years in prison?

1068
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,250
Luis, listen to him.

1069
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,625
-Would you?
-Yes.

1070
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:57,042
-Yeah?
-Why not?

1071
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:59,792
-And what would you ask him for?
-Money.

1072
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:03,125
-How much money?
-Lots of money.

1073
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:05,542
How much are seven years worth for you?

1074
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:09,125
-How much are seven years worth?
-Let's settle on a price.

1075
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:11,125
How much?

1076
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:13,875
Fifteen million.

1077
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:17,833
Shit!

1078
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:20,833
I'd have said ten.

1079
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:22,125
Fifteen is fairer.

1080
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:25,000
How is that measured?

1081
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:28,083
Why not...

1082
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:29,333
twenty?

1083
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:32,583
You think 20 is right?

1084
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:35,750
Twenty million.

1085
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,625
And 30?

1086
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:44,208
It sounds better, a rounder figure.

1087
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:45,875
Thirty is a number...

1088
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,500
If you leave the firm, yes.

1089
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,583
Marcel, would you leave?

1090
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:56,167
-Me?
-Yeah.

1091
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,292
-No.
-No.

1092
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,917
But I do have to leave.

1093
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,208
I do.

1094
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,917
And you, Vero?
Would you do it?

1095
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:14,375
I don't know.

1096
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,667
-No?
-I don't know.

1097
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,958
You wouldn't take the money?
Thirty million... Thirty million.

1098
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:20,042
No?

1099
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:23,875
I don't know.

1100
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,667
I know why you'd do it.

1101
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,750
Why?

1102
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:33,917
You'd go to prison,
if after those seven years

1103
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,042
you could be with him.

1104
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:40,042
You, him and the child.
Right?

1105
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:42,792
-What do you know?
-Wouldn't that be nice?

1106
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,917
-You know nothing.
-Really nice.

1107
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:56,417
Look, can he do that?

1108
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,042
We're looking at possibilities.

1109
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:00,417
He wants to buy me.

1110
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:05,875
Let's say they want to know
what share you want.

1111
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:07,958
What would you do?

1112
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:12,167
I have no say in it.
I'm just here to help you.

1113
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,375
Yes, but...

1114
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:17,208
What would you do?
Forget about the mediator.

1115
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:18,917
José Veiga,

1116
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,167
in your circumstances,
what would you do?

1117
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:24,875
It has to be one of the four partners.

1118
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:26,125
I know that.

1119
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:29,875
But would you spend
seven years of your life

1120
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:31,750
in prison

1121
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:33,083
for thirty million?

1122
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:43,208
For quite a bit less.

1123
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:48,542
But that would be my share,

1124
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:51,417
and we're here to find out what yours is,

1125
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,750
what you want.

1126
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:15,708
"Smoking kills," it says.

1127
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:20,292
Those warnings are good.

1128
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:26,208
If you smoke, you could die.
Up to you.

1129
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:31,792
Can you imagine
if everything had those warnings?

1130
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:35,292
"Don't go with that woman.

1131
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:38,667
She might ruin your life."

1132
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,375
Or, "Don't take that job.

1133
01:05:42,292 --> 01:05:43,667
You may not be happy."

1134
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:47,167
Or, "Be careful about your friends.

1135
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:50,375
They might be real sons of bitches."

1136
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:54,333
Like everyone, right?
Like everyone.

1137
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,042
It would be good if they warned you.

1138
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,333
It would be really good.

1139
01:06:08,792 --> 01:06:09,833
All right.

1140
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,125
I'll make the transfer.

1141
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:14,208
You will?

1142
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,250
Luis,

1143
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,542
it's for the best.

1144
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,792
But in exchange, I want...

1145
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:32,875
51% of the firm's shares.

1146
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:38,917
That's what I want.

1147
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,917
You're not going to run the firm.

1148
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:46,333
I may do it better than you.
I'll have lots of time, Marcel.

1149
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:48,375
-I won't allow it.
-No?

1150
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:50,708
-No.
-Then you go to prison.

1151
01:06:50,792 --> 01:06:52,583
Anyone want to go to prison?

1152
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,833
No one? All right.

1153
01:06:55,917 --> 01:06:56,958
Then I'll go.

1154
01:06:57,042 --> 01:06:58,625
No, I said no.

1155
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,125
All right.
So, how would this work?

1156
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:06,167
Do we cede them, or do you buy them?

1157
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,625
No, no, I buy them.

1158
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:10,375
-Perfect. At what price?
-The price of the last offer we had.

1159
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:11,917
-I accept.
-Carlos. Carlos.

1160
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,667
-No, no.
-You're crazy.

1161
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:17,208
No, I'm not. I'm fucking fed up
with this and I want to end it now.

1162
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:19,708
-It's this, or we're screwed.
-No, that won't happen.

1163
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:22,500
-Trust me.
-I'm through with you.

1164
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:23,958
With you and your fucking ego.

1165
01:07:24,042 --> 01:07:27,833
We're ending this now.
I accept. You?

1166
01:07:27,917 --> 01:07:30,125
-Fine with me.
-Wait, wait, wait.

1167
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:34,750
We're all very tired
and it's hard to think clearly.

1168
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:35,833
Luis,

1169
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,000
think of another option,

1170
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:43,917
-or we have to start from zero.
-No, no, we're not doing that.

1171
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,625
I sell him 13% of my share,

1172
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:47,125
you do the same,
and Luis has the majority.

1173
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:48,458
We don't need you.

1174
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,875
-Is that it?
-Yes, that's it.

1175
01:07:51,958 --> 01:07:53,292
You want to get rid of me.

1176
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,583
-Well, I refuse.
-You do?

1177
01:07:56,667 --> 01:08:00,167
-I'll tell the judge everything.
-You're kidding.

1178
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,292
No.

1179
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:05,458
You'd send all four of us to prison
so as not to lose control?

1180
01:08:05,542 --> 01:08:08,083
This is a mess, and I won't allow it.

1181
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:12,083
-You won't allow it.
-No, I devoted my life to this.

1182
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:13,500
-And I didn't? And him, and him?
-All of us.

1183
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,458
-We all did.
-It doesn't look like it.

1184
01:08:15,542 --> 01:08:18,667
-Marcel, it's all been settled.
-Luis is useless.

1185
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,500
-And?
-He isn't prepared.

1186
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:21,958
I'm here, too.
Or am I not capable either?

1187
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:23,292
Shut up.

1188
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:34,292
I said I won't allow it.

1189
01:08:35,542 --> 01:08:38,500
Yes, yes, you are going to allow it.

1190
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:40,042
You know why?

1191
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:43,583
I'll call Chloe and tell her everything.

1192
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:45,500
You won't.
It doesn't interest you.

1193
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:49,417
Does it interest you that I tell her
we've been screwing for 15 years?

1194
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,083
Since before you met her.

1195
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:54,542
If you want
I'll call her right now and tell her.

1196
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:57,667
And the times we were in hotels
on business trips

1197
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:00,167
and you knock on my door
asking to screw me.

1198
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,958
Want me to tell her that?
Don't laugh.

1199
01:09:03,042 --> 01:09:05,625
I can also tell her that
you're not just screwing your partner,

1200
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:09,208
you also like to screw the intern
and an occasional client.

1201
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:12,917
If you want,
tell me and I'll do it now.

1202
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,708
-She won't believe you.
-I've got photos of you.

1203
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:16,792
From when?

1204
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:18,542
A dick is a dick.

1205
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:20,083
Chloe has to know.

1206
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
That's how it is.
And given your track record,

1207
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:26,417
she'll get custody of your daughter.

1208
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:28,625
I'm sorry.

1209
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:31,458
Don't worry.

1210
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,375
-Children adapt very quickly.
-Yes.

1211
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:36,417
-I'm sure she'll love Montreal.
-Children love the cold.

1212
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,792
Look, you can't go on like this.

1213
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,583
Why?

1214
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:42,375
All the parties have to agree.

1215
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:45,417
We're just talking.

1216
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,542
Looking at options, like you said.

1217
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:52,125
-Yes, but you have to do it freely.
-Freely?

1218
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:55,583
No, not freely.
Nobody is free.

1219
01:09:55,667 --> 01:09:56,792
Nobody.

1220
01:09:56,875 --> 01:10:00,083
Look at your contract.
It has to be on some page.

1221
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:04,292
Marcel, do you accept or not?

1222
01:10:09,667 --> 01:10:11,958
-You disgust me.
-Yes, we're disgusting.

1223
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,625
We're disgusting,
but is that a yes or a no?

1224
01:10:20,292 --> 01:10:21,333
Yes.

1225
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,375
Very well.

1226
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:27,625
The mediation would end here.

1227
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:31,125
Yes.

1228
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:32,833
Okay.

1229
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:33,958
Yes.

1230
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:35,958
And if you don't mind,

1231
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:38,292
please pass me the contract
so I can sign it.

1232
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:39,708
Sure, here it is.

1233
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,292
Let's do it.

1234
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:47,292
Yes, Natalia.

1235
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:51,792
What?
Stop, stop, Luis.

1236
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:54,750
Wait, I'm putting you on speaker.

1237
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:56,750
What is it?

1238
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:04,417
-Speak now.
<i>-That's it, guys. It's all over.</i>

1239
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:07,000
What's all over?

1240
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,583
<i>There's no case.</i>

1241
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,500
<i>No one will go on trial.</i>

1242
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:12,583
-But how?
-Are you sure?

1243
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,125
<i>Yes, 100% sure.</i>

1244
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:16,750
-Why?
<i>-We've been very lucky.</i>

1245
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:21,083
<i>We located the IRS official</i>
<i>and he wrote the report.</i>

1246
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:25,208
<i>A reasonable man,</i>
<i>open to hearing proposals</i>

1247
01:12:25,292 --> 01:12:28,125
<i>and let's say we came</i>
<i>to an understanding.</i>

1248
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,875
<i>We'll have to recognize his help.</i>
<i>It will cost us.</i>

1249
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:34,583
<i>But the report will be amended</i>

1250
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:36,417
<i>to say that the fraud</i>
<i>is not more than 120,000 euros.</i>

1251
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,250
<i>No one will go to prison.</i>

1252
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:39,667
<i>We'll have to pay a fine.</i>

1253
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,625
<i>At most, an administrative fine.</i>

1254
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:44,708
<i>The important thing is it doesn't matter</i>
<i>what the judge says.</i>

1255
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:47,875
<i>Those who sure will smell the rat</i>
<i>are those of the UDEF.</i>

1256
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,833
<i>They'll be watching for some time.</i>

1257
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:53,375
<i>So you have to be careful,</i>
<i>but just carry on as always.</i>

1258
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:54,875
<i>As if nothing happened.</i>

1259
01:12:54,958 --> 01:12:58,958
<i>Keep going with projects,</i>
<i>meetings, calls. Hmm?</i>

1260
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,750
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1261
01:13:01,833 --> 01:13:03,958
Thanks, we'll call you later.

1262
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,792
Well, good night.

1263
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:14,375
If you don't need anything else from me,

1264
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:15,958
I'll see you on Monday.

1264
01:13:16,305 --> 01:14:16,436

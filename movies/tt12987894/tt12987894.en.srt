2
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,266
Bella, come here.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,466
Hey, guys. My name is Shanann Watts.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,566
I live in Frederick, Colorado.

5
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,066
Say, "Hi, CeCe." Say, "Hi, Bells."

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,533
Hi, Bells.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,000
No, you've gotta say, "Hi."

8
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,100
Hi.

9
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:29,533
And, um...

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,033
We can't forget Dieter.
Here comes Dieter.

11
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:38,100
Daddy won't do it
if you keep falling off.

12
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,000
Baba!

13
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:42,733
When Chris and I got married,
we moved out here after visiting,

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,900
fell in love with the area.

15
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:45,800
It's gorgeous in Colorado.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,133
We created a life for ourselves out here.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,833
Chris found an amazing job
that takes care of him.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,766
They respect him, which is huge

19
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,900
for any job that you have,
and we love it here.

20
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:02,100
I'm making some
Italian cookies today.

21
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:05,666
Gotta be careful 'cause CeCe's allergic
to everything that we love,

22
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,366
like pistachio cookies and walnut cookies.

23
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:12,766
But this guy right here,
he's gonna do all the dishes.

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,933
That's me.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,933
I'd rather bake and he can clean.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,666
- I'll do...
- I can eat it later.

27
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:20,733
See?

28
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,200
Nice.

29
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,000
We'll come back with CeCe and Bella later.

30
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,966
And we'll do
the "Here we go, Steelers!" chants.

31
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:30,300
'Cause they love it.

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,466
Say, "Go, Steelers!"

33
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:35,900
All right, guys.
I'll talk to you guys soon. Bye.

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,600
<i>My name's Nickole,
and I'm calling</i>

35
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,600
<i>because I'm concerned
about a friend of mine.</i>

36
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:51,733
<i>I dropped her off at her house
at two in the morning last night.</i>

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,400
<i>I haven't been able
to get a hold of her this morning.</i>

38
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,666
<i>I've gone to her house
and her car's there.</i>

39
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:59,300
<i>But she won't answer the door.
She won't answer phone calls.</i>

40
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:01,166
<i>She won't answer text messages.</i>

41
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,366
<i>They have two little girls,
three and four.</i>

42
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,933
<i>I mean, there's no movement
in the house whatsoever.</i>

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,133
<i>- What's her name?
- Shanann Watts.</i>

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,166
<i>Alrighty, we'll have an officer
come out that way as soon as we can.</i>

45
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:15,500
<i>I would just advise you</i>

46
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:18,666
<i>to not try to make entry
into the house or anything like that.</i>

47
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,266
- How you guys doing?
- Hi.

48
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,566
- Are you Nickole?
- Yes.

49
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:25,500
Okay, what's going on?

50
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:29,566
So, my friend, um, we were out of town
for a business trip this weekend.

51
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,133
- All right.
- I dropped her off

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,966
at two o'clock this morning.
She was very distraught over the weekend,

53
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:37,066
wasn't eating normally, or drinking,
and we kept trying to force it on her.

54
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,566
Shanann, are you home?

55
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,133
She had a doctor's
appointment this morning at 9:00,

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,066
and she didn't go
to the doctor's appointment.

57
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,900
Okay, no answer on the phone,
husband's on his way.

58
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:54,800
Yes.

59
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:57,200
You can't get in the house
unless you see signs of...

60
00:03:57,266 --> 00:04:01,033
Yep, I've gotta have more unless
I get consent from him to go in.

61
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,466
Um...

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,566
It could be grandparents
came and picked them up.

63
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:12,266
You know, it could be a lot of things.
She left her phone, her phone's dead.

64
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,266
How you doing?
You seen your neighbors today?

65
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,066
- Uh-uh.
- No? Okay.

66
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,500
Why? What's going on?

67
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,433
We're just trying
to get a hold of her.

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,600
Felt like she wasn't feeling too good.

69
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,100
They're just concerned.

70
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,833
Is there a key code, Sandi,

71
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,000
to open the garage from the outside?

72
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,133
What is it?

73
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:37,700
This is her parents.

74
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:42,133
<i>Frank, what's the key code
for the garage?</i>

75
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,300
<i>Shanann's house. The cops are there.</i>

76
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:48,900
Well, I can't go in,
but if they... allow you to go in,

77
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:51,900
I have to have the property
owner's permission to enter.

78
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:53,400
<i>What's going on?</i>

79
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:57,066
Okay... well, he's the property owner.

80
00:04:57,133 --> 00:05:00,400
<i>He told me Shanann
was at a girlfriend's house.</i>

81
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,466
- Do we know who that is?
- Do we know who...

82
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,833
Or a phone number?

83
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,933
<i>He didn't say.</i>

84
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:11,166
Shanann, are you home?

85
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,800
Police department,
if anyone's inside make yourself known!

86
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:23,966
- <i>Nicky.</i>
- I'm here, keep talking.

87
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,966
- <i>Yeah, keep me on the phone.</i>
- Okay, getting out the way.

88
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,933
- Scott, how you doing?
- How's it going?

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,800
So, this is the only vehicle
she would have?

90
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:38,366
- Only one that... yeah.
- She would drive? Okay.

91
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,433
Can we go in the house?

92
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,266
Well, he can.

93
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,700
I mean, that's up to him.
It's his house because...

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,866
<i>Nicky, I'm giving you permission
to walk into my daughter's house.</i>

95
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,533
Mind if I come in, Chris?

96
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,900
- Okay.
- All right.

97
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:56,533
Yeah.

98
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,133
I'm checking the house,
with consent.

99
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,566
And you checked upstairs?
She's not there?

100
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:05,800
I just want to make sure she's not
passed out somewhere. Is she diabetic?

101
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,733
No, if she has low
blood sugar, her...

102
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll ask her.

103
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:17,433
Her parents are out of state?

104
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,100
They're across country, North Carolina.

105
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,233
Oh.

106
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,100
Yeah, so that's not happening.

107
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,166
All the girls' blankies are gone.

108
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:33,500
Um...

109
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:36,233
Their blankies they sleep with.
They don't leave without them.

110
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Okay...

111
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:42,000
Nothing else appears to be missing?
Just stuff you'd take for a quick trip?

112
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,466
- Her phone.
- Her phone's here?

113
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,933
Her phone's here.

114
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:54,633
Does she work?

115
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,500
- Yeah, she works from home.
- From home?

116
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,166
She works and this is her lifeline.

117
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,400
When that thing turns back on,
it's going to start blowing up.

118
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,966
- Oh, yeah, trust me.
- That's what Chris said.

119
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:10,766
- And it was shut down?
- Yeah.

120
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,333
So, that's 1... 31... 8... 19.

121
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,400
What's the first thing?

122
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,233
'Bout to blow up.

123
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,666
What does she do for work?

124
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,466
She works at a direct sales
company called Thrive.

125
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:42,366
- This is her purse?
<i>- </i>That's her purse. Is her medication in?

126
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:43,933
She takes these, uh...

127
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,000
Her medication's still in here.

128
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,600
<i>What about the mobile home?</i>

129
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,533
Hey, everybody.

130
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,200
So, I'm gonna wait till
a couple more people hop on here...

131
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,200
and I just want you guys
to know a little bit of my story.

132
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:05,066
I was in a place for a long time
where I felt very insecure.

133
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:06,233
I was married,

134
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,866
went through a really awful divorce,

135
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:12,833
and that relationship
really took a lot from me.

136
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,733
It took my confidence. It took everything.

137
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,300
It literally took everything.

138
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,433
But I'm not a quitter.

139
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:23,266
And my goal was to buy a house.

140
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,800
My family doesn't come from money.
We always worked hard for what we had.

141
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:32,000
And so I worked and worked
and worked and worked.

142
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:35,033
And I was 25 years old
when I built my first house.

143
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,300
And that was the biggest accomplishment
I felt I've ever done,

144
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,033
because I did it by myself.

145
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,633
I did it by working my tail off.

146
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:51,633
Then, ten years ago, I went from being
super energetic, super happy...

147
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,966
I started losing a lot of my hair.

148
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:57,266
I felt like I had the flu all the time.

149
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,233
I felt miserable.

150
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,766
And then I was diagnosed with Lupus,
which is an autoimmune disease.

151
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,566
I went through
one of the darkest times of my life,

152
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,900
and then I met Chris.

153
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,800
And I couldn't have
asked God for a better man.

154
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:16,333
She doesn't ever black out
or have seizures or anything?

155
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,333
No, I mean, she...
A long, long, long, long time ago.

156
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,900
She got in a car wreck,
and they believe that's what happened.

157
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:26,133
But Imitrex is something
she takes for migraines.

158
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,200
She took more Imitrex this
last month than she ever had before,

159
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,706
but that's because she was
in North Carolina with the humidity

160
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:34,933
and everything like that. She was there
for six weeks, and we got back...

161
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:40,633
Monday or Tuesday, and then
she flew out to Arizona Friday morning.

162
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:44,566
And then she got back last night...
about 2:00 a.m.

163
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:47,433
Flight got delayed. She left about 11:00.
She got here at 2:00.

164
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,333
Okay.

165
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,266
I went to work this
morning around 5:15, 5:30.

166
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:54,666
What do you do?

167
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,466
I work at oil and gas, Anadarko.

168
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:57,766
What do you do for them?

169
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,833
- Operator.
- Oh.

170
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,700
Her wedding ring's here?

171
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,366
It was on the nightstand
next to her side of the bed.

172
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:20,466
There was no note
or anything by the wedding ring?

173
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:21,533
No.

174
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:31,166
I wasn't looking
for a boyfriend,

175
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,500
and all of a sudden,
I get a friend request.

176
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,300
I said, "What the heck,
I'll never meet him.

177
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:38,533
He's just a Facebook friend.
I have a million of them."

178
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,766
But thing about Facebook is you
eventually probably meet the person.

179
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:47,433
When I met Chris, I pushed him away.
I gave him an out every single day.

180
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,566
He went to my colonoscopy.

181
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:53,433
I tortured him. I rejected him.

182
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
But he stuck around.

183
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:58,866
And he stuck around
because he was the one for me.

184
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,033
I couldn't ask
for a better man for her.

185
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,666
He makes her smile,
and she makes him smile.

186
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,533
God bless you both.

187
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,066
I just want to say I love you both.
You look great together.

188
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,833
She's been looking
her whole life for a good guy.

189
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,000
I couldn't ask for a better one.

190
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,233
I love you guys.

191
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,333
And now we have two kids.
We live in Colorado.

192
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,166
And he's the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

193
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,166
Don't eat Turtle!

194
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,733
Ah, he got Turtle! He's got Turtle!

195
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,200
Definitely an odd one.

196
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,633
I don't know what I should do.

197
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,866
Should I drive around, like,
the normal route that she would be?

198
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:55,000
- Where does she normally go to?
- I mean, just like...

199
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,866
Drive where, like, she would
normally take the kids to school. Um...

200
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:04,233
People that I know that live down...
Kristen lives down that way.

201
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,833
That's the only people...
only routes I know she'd take.

202
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Does she go
to their house frequently, or...

203
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:11,366
Not much, but...

204
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,166
Neighbor over there said he has
a camera that sees out into the street.

205
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,033
Now, is this on continually?

206
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,166
- Yep.
- Recording?

207
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:31,000
- Yep, any motion that it...
- Okay, so it's motion.

208
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,200
Any motion event
that happens, I got.

209
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:36,833
But I get cars driving
from this street, from this street.

210
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,233
This is him at 5:17.

211
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,533
I usually park out there on
the side so I can get everything back in.

212
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,866
Be easier instead of lugging everything
out there, tools I had to bring in.

213
00:12:56,366 --> 00:13:00,033
Because if there is any sort
of action out there, I would have got it.

214
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,000
- Right.
- Like, we had issues the other week

215
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:06,966
when people were stealing stuff
out of garages and stuff like that.

216
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:10,533
- And I had to park my truck...
- I have you parked right here.

217
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,433
I had seen someone tried
to jimmy with a flathead screwdriver.

218
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:17,700
- Over there.
- Yeah, I've got nothing.

219
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,700
Nothing for the rest of the day?

220
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:21,966
No, that's it.

221
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,333
She's pregnant as well, sir.

222
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,000
- How far along?
- Fourteen, 15 weeks.

223
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,166
We did it again.

224
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,066
I like that shirt.

225
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:56,166
- Really?
- Really.

226
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,666
That's awesome.

227
00:13:58,266 --> 00:13:59,666
So, pink means?

228
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,300
- That's just the test.
- I know.

229
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,133
I was just...
'cause pink is gonna be girls?

230
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,266
I don't know.

231
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,233
- It's just the test.
- That's awesome.

232
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:15,766
I guess... guess...
guess when you want to, it happens.

233
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:17,566
Wow.

234
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,766
Guess what, girls?

235
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,033
Guess what, guess what, guess what, CeCe?

236
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,566
There's a baby in mommy's belly.

237
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,766
Belly... a baby.

238
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,900
It's in mommy's belly,
you silly.

239
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,133
It is in my belly.

240
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,833
Boy, boy, Chris wants a boy.
I hope it's a boy for him.

241
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,166
It'll make him happy.

242
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,700
We go for our first ultrasound
at three... ish, 3:15.

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And I'm kind of nervous.

244
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:53,133
'Cause every time you go you're like,
"Is there one? Is there two?

245
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,233
Is there three?"

246
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,766
Hey, Bella, how many babies
do I have in my belly?

247
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,666
Five.

248
00:14:57,733 --> 00:15:00,933
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

249
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,366
That's a lot of babies.

250
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,733
I can't tell you guys
how much I am blessed.

251
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:08,633
I was told I couldn't have kids.

252
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,966
That CeCe, Bella?

253
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:12,466
Say, "CeCe."

254
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:18,966
But I had two beautiful girls,
little baby monsters as I call 'em.

255
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,166
She looks shocked.

256
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:22,566
Say, "Hi."

257
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:25,800
CeCe doesn't stop, literally.

258
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:29,600
Bella is just now getting old enough
to know what she's wanting in life.

259
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,233
She wants to be, um...

260
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,133
Uh, Elsa when she grows up.

261
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,833
- All right, appreciate your time.
- Thank you so much.

262
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,200
- Hopefully something comes up.
- Yeah.

263
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,000
You mind if I...

264
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:58,200
You just wanna go talk to him?
I'm gonna get his info real quick.

265
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,366
He's not acting right at all.

266
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:01,433
No?

267
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,600
He's never fidgety.

268
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,800
He's never rocking back and forth.
And if you look here...

269
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:14,500
He never loads his stuff
in and out of the garage, ever.

270
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:15,566
Right.

271
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,133
He's normally...
You can ask them.

272
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,433
He's normally quiet, real subdued.

273
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,766
He never talks. So, the fact that
he's over here blabbing his mouth

274
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,233
makes me kind of suspicious of something.

275
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,033
Yeah, but, I mean,
put yourself in his situation.

276
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,966
Oh, I agree.

277
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,733
You know,
anyone's gonna be nervous.

278
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,066
You don't know what to do.

279
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,633
Do all your friends
have kids the same age?

280
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,566
Mmm-hmm.

281
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,300
- It's hard to...
- It's really hard.

282
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,609
I mean, we've exhausted... I've exhausted
every option I know as far as friends go.

283
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:47,300
Nicky knew more of them because,
uh, she's a woman... and...

284
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,366
that's about as far as we could go as far
as all the friends that we could think of.

285
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,433
- Do you want my card?
- I'll take it.

286
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,000
Just call that number,
someone will answer that phone 24/7. So...

287
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,600
- Okay, sweet.
- And then just leave your contact info,

288
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,900
- and an officer will call you back.
- Thank you.

289
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,933
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

290
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,333
I'm just worried sick.
I don't know where she's at.

291
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,033
This is completely unlike her.

292
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
This isn't right.
I don't know what to do right now.

293
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:19,466
If they're not safe, that's what's...
that's what's tearing me apart.

294
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,242
This is Officer Goodman,
Frederick Police Department.

295
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,700
<i>Yeah, this is Chris Watts.</i>

296
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:43,066
We're just trying to get some of
your wife and kids' information entered in

297
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,000
to put some alerts out there.

298
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:48,533
Bella, do you know her height,
weight, hair color, and eyes?

299
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,500
<i>Height would be 42 inches.</i>

300
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:52,633
Okay.

301
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,400
<i>Weight would be 40 pounds.</i>

302
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:59,100
<i>Hair color would be brown,
eye color would be brown as well.</i>

303
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:02,766
Okay, does she have
any scars, marks, tattoos?

304
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:04,100
<i>No.</i>

305
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,133
Okay, and then on Celeste.

306
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,833
<i>She is... 37 inches tall.</i>

307
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,366
<i>Thirty-seven pounds, blond hair.</i>

308
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:15,166
- Eyes?
- <i>Hazel eyes.</i>

309
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,233
Hazel.

310
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,933
Okay, and again,
no scars, marks, tattoos?

311
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,900
- <i>No.</i>
- Okay.

312
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,733
Does Shanann have
any scars, marks, or tattoos?

313
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,800
<i>She has a scar on her forehead
that only pops out every once in a while,</i>

314
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:31,700
<i>from that car wreck she had
a long time ago, but no tattoos.</i>

315
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:33,866
Okay, yeah, well,
if you hear something,

316
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,233
obviously let us know as soon as you can,

317
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,866
and if you can think of anything,
of anything that might help us.

318
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,300
- <i>Okay, thank you very much, sir.</i>
- All right, bye.

319
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:43,366
<i>Bye.</i>

320
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:01,633
Hi. Officer of the
Frederick Police Department.

321
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,000
We were out earlier
and left a flyer on your door?

322
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:05,066
Yes.

323
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,133
- Have you seen this lady?
- Oh my gosh, I've seen her on Facebook.

324
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,566
Facebook, okay.

325
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:15,633
- Does she live in the area?
- She does, yep.

326
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,566
I'll be on the lookout.

327
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:20,466
Anything different
over the last,

328
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,633
I don't know, two days, three days?

329
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:25,866
Odd vehicles, odd noises, odd lights?

330
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,633
There was a truck out here yesterday.

331
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,000
In fact, that's why I thought
you were here yesterday.

332
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:33,133
- Maybe someone complained about...
- Okay.

333
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,400
That I hadn't seen... seen before.

334
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,833
What type of truck?

335
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,233
Um...

336
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:42,166
it was kind of almost a steel gray.

337
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,033
- Don't ask me the make.
- Okay.

338
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,000
Or year, but that was late afternoon.

339
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:52,833
The dad has a great
big truck and it's gray.

340
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,433
But this one was smaller.

341
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,566
- Okay.
- This one was smaller.

342
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:02,800
Hey, Chris.

343
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:04,906
So, we need to have
everybody step out of the house.

344
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:05,966
- Okay.
- Um...

345
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Mostly we don't want
the dogs to get confused

346
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:09,900
- with all the scents.
- Correct.

347
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:13,233
So, you can leave that there.
You can leave your camera there.

348
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,600
I'll bring it outside.
I don't wanna mess you guys up.

349
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,500
Because my scent has... yeah.

350
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,066
There's an upstairs, yep.
All the bedrooms are upstairs.

351
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,633
You know, maybe I'm just
old-fashioned, but this

352
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,366
almost seems like this place is
a little bit too immaculate to be normal.

353
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,233
It's amazingly clean.

354
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,900
You wanna give me
your first and last name?

355
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:39,666
I'm Chris Watts. W-A-T-T-S.

356
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,600
Do you think she just took off?

357
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,600
I mean, right now I don't even wanna just,
like, throw anything out there, like...

358
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:50,233
I hope that she's somewhere safe
right now and with the kids.

359
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,666
But, I mean, could she have
just taken off? I don't know.

360
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:58,400
But if somebody has her and they're
not safe, like, I want them back now.

361
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,633
This might be a tough question,
but did...

362
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,800
did you guys get
into an argument before she left?

363
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:07,700
It wasn't like an argument.
We had an emotional conversation,

364
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,866
but I'll leave it at that,
but it's... I just want them back.

365
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:14,966
Well, police really don't have
a lot of information right now.

366
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:17,566
We do know that this neighborhood
where Shanann Watts

367
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,133
and her two little girls live

368
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
is the last place that anyone
saw the three missing people.

369
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,566
- Do you want this shut?
- Probably, you know.

370
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:40,000
- Do you have a preference?
- It doesn't matter to me.

371
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,633
All right, let's do this.

372
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:47,166
So, I know it's hard to talk about.

373
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:49,333
You mentioned that
there was a hard conversation

374
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,700
the two of you had about your marriage.

375
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,633
Can you really get
into that conversation with me?

376
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,966
I talked to her about how
I was feeling, about how I felt.

377
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,766
What's been going on
with us for the last six weeks,

378
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,966
'cause she was in North Carolina,
and I was down there just the last week.

379
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:12,500
But, just being apart and just, like,
figuring out who people are...

380
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:16,133
Honestly, like, the best way
for people to find out who they are

381
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,066
- is to spend time apart.
- I agree.

382
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:23,300
When we were together, we could feel,
like, it wasn't there, that spark.

383
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:26,966
I know it's kind of cliché,
but that spark wasn't there anymore.

384
00:22:27,033 --> 00:22:29,866
And that's why I got
so emotional right there.

385
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,800
Okay... emotional for you, too?

386
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:35,033
- Oh, yeah. I was bawling my eyes out.
- Yeah.

387
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,500
Looking back on that conversation,
can you connect the dots between

388
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,800
both of you being upset and crying...

389
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:44,333
and here we are now,
she and the kids are gone?

390
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,500
I think about, like, did I cause this?

391
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,166
Like, did I make her feel,
like, she needed to leave?

392
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,466
Maybe she sat there
and thought about it, like,

393
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,566
"Do I really need to stay here right now?

394
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:58,633
Like, if he doesn't love me,
maybe I should just go."

395
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,933
CeCe!

396
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,333
This way. Come on.

397
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,333
You wanna go see the airplane?

398
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,333
Bella, CeCe, my dad and I are flying
to North Carolina for six weeks.

399
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,833
We're gonna spend time with our families

400
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,333
and friends and everything else.

401
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:29,000
And Chris will be coming
at the end of July.

402
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:31,933
One day, Chris can
travel that long with us.

403
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
We're going up.

404
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:43,700
Who's here?

405
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,233
Hi!

406
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,900
Hi, Nana.

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,266
Careful, oh, my goodness.

408
00:23:57,866 --> 00:24:02,700
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

409
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:07,500
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

410
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,600
<i>Happy birthday, dear Nana!</i>

411
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:13,733
<i>And on...</i>

412
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,700
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

413
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,000
- All right!
- Wow!

414
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:24,800
Hi, there.

415
00:24:24,866 --> 00:24:27,366
- Are you Nickole? Hi.
- Hello. We're gonna... yeah.

416
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,900
Agent Greg Zettner
with Colorado Bureau of Investigation.

417
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:30,800
Okay.

418
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:33,106
So, I understand you and Shanann
are pretty good friends.

419
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,633
Yeah, we hang out a lot,
we have kids the same age.

420
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,766
Did Shanann ever say anything
to you about their relationship?

421
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,266
I think it was
the second or third week

422
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,000
she was in North Carolina.

423
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,400
She got in a fight with Chris's mom,

424
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:49,500
because she went
to Chris's mom's house to visit,

425
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:51,633
and the grandma, her name's Cindy...

426
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,533
Cindy bought ice cream that has everything
CeCe's allergic to in it.

427
00:24:55,933 --> 00:25:01,466
So, Shanann asked Cindy, "Please do not
give this to CeCe. She cannot have it."

428
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:24,800
<i>I knew that Shanann and his mom,
Cindy, were fighting again.</i>

429
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:30,700
<i>This is coming from Cindy
that CeCe had a food allergy.</i>

430
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:35,933
<i>And Shanann came into the living room
and was just yelling at Cindy,</i>

431
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,366
<i>telling her she's trying to kill her baby
or something,</i>

432
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:42,100
<i>because of the food allergy,
and Cindy claims she had no idea about it.</i>

433
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,733
<i>They had this huge argument</i>

434
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,133
<i>and she ended up kicking
Shanann out of the house.</i>

435
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,033
Can you cut the lights?

436
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,400
So, they argued and Shanann
got back to her parents' house.

437
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:56,433
As far as I know, she did not
go back and see his parents.

438
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,033
But they celebrated CeCe's birthday
while they were down there,

439
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,766
and the parents
did not come to the birthday party.

440
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:05,866
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

441
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:11,666
<i>Happy birthday, dear CeCe</i>

442
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:15,633
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

443
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,333
Yay!

444
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,666
There was an incident

445
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:38,666
where she had some ice cream
that CeCe couldn't have.

446
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:40,500
That kind of drove Shanann to where, like,

447
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,466
"All right,
they can't come over ever again

448
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:46,966
if you're gonna have this in this house."
And that's why that happened.

449
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:51,900
I was hurt. I was like, you know, I wanted
my parents to see their grandbabies.

450
00:26:51,966 --> 00:26:55,633
- "Silly monkeys."
- Monkeys, jumping on the bed!

451
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,333
Growing up and in high school,
if you hurt my feelings,

452
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,366
I never told you,
because I didn't like conflict.

453
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:02,866
I really wasn't a big conflict person.

454
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:05,866
I always lived for
other people until recently.

455
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:10,533
Now I live for me and for my
family, my kids. I live for them.

456
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,966
Does your gut tell you that
Shanann and the kids walked out,

457
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,366
or that they were taken out?

458
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,300
At first, I really thought maybe
she was just at somebody's house,

459
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:23,206
- just decompressing.
- Just blowing off steam.

460
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,466
Yeah, but after today, like,
with the onslaught of all the cars,

461
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:31,600
I mean, all the police cars,
all the news, all the K-9 units,

462
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:36,933
it's making me lean the other direction
about someone took her.

463
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,533
- Okay.
- But this is... if someone took her,

464
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,133
it would have to have been
someone she knew,

465
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:49,400
because there's no sign of anything,
like, being disturbed or broken.

466
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,933
And it's freaking me out.

467
00:28:56,633 --> 00:29:00,933
She texted me and said things were bad
and that she didn't know what she did.

468
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,400
Or what was going on with Chris
and she thought that it was his parents.

469
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:08,300
The only other time he's ever
acted like this in the marriage

470
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:10,100
was right after they got married.

471
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:12,766
- I will love you.
- I will love you.

472
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,466
- And stand by you.
- And stand by you.

473
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:18,133
- As long as we both shall live.
- As long as we both shall live.

474
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,833
And it was because his parents
didn't go to their wedding.

475
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,866
So, his parents did not like her?

476
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:25,400
No, they do not like her.
Yeah, they do not like her.

477
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:26,566
His parents do not.

478
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,266
Chris, you may kiss your wife.

479
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,033
- Do you know the reason for that?
- She can be bossy.

480
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,900
But in a good way.

481
00:29:32,966 --> 00:29:36,500
I mean, it's not like... I've teased her,
because I'm like, "You're so bossy."

482
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:40,633
But it's... she's trying to push you
to do good things and, like, motivate you.

483
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,800
It's not like a... bitchy bossy.

484
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:46,200
My mom just never
thought she was good enough.

485
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:48,733
So, what was the blow up
at the wedding about?

486
00:29:49,466 --> 00:29:51,500
It was just... my mom.

487
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:54,533
And very much my sister.
They just didn't like her.

488
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Oh.

489
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:59,766
They just thought that Shanann
had taken me away from them

490
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,366
and taken me off to Colorado.

491
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,666
I'm definitely the...
dominant one in the relationship.

492
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,700
Um, he's very... sweet.

493
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:09,666
He's very calm. Um...

494
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:13,700
I'm the high-strung one
in the relationship.

495
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,833
Santa's here,
but the kids are freaking out.

496
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:24,733
Hey, Santa, where's your phone?

497
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,966
- In the garage.
- I wanted it.

498
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:29,766
Oh.

499
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:33,300
I always say I have more
patience for children than I do adults,

500
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:35,233
and I guess that goes for my husband.

501
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,966
He's such a great guy
to put up with me over the years.

502
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,566
Sit down, Santa. Have a seat.

503
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:45,233
I'll try to get the kids.

504
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:51,233
Ho, ho, ho!

505
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,366
- You're Santa?
- Yes.

506
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,933
Where's the phone?

507
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,500
On top of your car in the garage.

508
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,766
I needed it for pictures,
hold on.

509
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:07,100
I gotta get the phone.
This is hard as one parent.

510
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:11,166
I wanna get the phone,
so I can get pictures. Hold, please.

511
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:13,033
<i>...period garage door.</i>

512
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,400
My husband's a genius.

513
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Doesn't listen.

514
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:21,000
Is there anyone that you think
that maybe your wife got close with?

515
00:31:22,133 --> 00:31:26,233
If she did, it was very, like,
secretive then, if that was the case.

516
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,666
'Cause I had no inkling.
No, it wasn't even a suspicion.

517
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,400
Not one guy? Or girl.

518
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:38,100
I'm... if that was the case, I mean,
I didn't have one suspicion about it.

519
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,166
Like, if it happened...

520
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,300
it wasn't even like...

521
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,300
I wasn't aware.

522
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:47,133
- Now, let's talk about you.
- Okay.

523
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:50,233
I see pictures of you
from a few years ago,

524
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,633
and I see you standing before me now.

525
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,700
- Okay.
- You've gotten pretty fit.

526
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:59,966
You can imagine when guys start cheating
or want to cheat, that's what happens.

527
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:03,266
- So, tell me about it.
- I did not cheat on my wife.

528
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:06,933
- I went from 245 pounds to about...
- You were 245?

529
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,133
- I was 245 pounds.
- Jeez, you look great, man.

530
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,533
Thank you, I'm 185, 180 right now.

531
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,300
Okay, and I've got to imagine that maybe
there was a girl that inspired that.

532
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:21,333
No, I have never cheated on my wife.

533
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,666
Okay, you know that we have to get
to the bottom of this.

534
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:26,033
- You know that.
- Yeah.

535
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
Okay.

536
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:30,566
- Would you take a polygraph?
- Sure.

537
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,900
Okay.

538
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,600
My name is Chris Watts.

539
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:37,733
I'm doing my speech
on relationship deterioration and repair.

540
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,633
You have to ask yourself three questions
when you're in a relationship.

541
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:44,533
"Do I have a desire to keep
this relationship going?"

542
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,700
"Do I have a moral obligation
to stay in this relationship?"

543
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,333
Or, "Is it a necessity for me
to stay in this relationship?"

544
00:32:53,033 --> 00:32:55,333
Sometimes a necessity could be children.

545
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,566
Sometimes, when you have children,

546
00:32:57,633 --> 00:32:59,400
and your relationship
starts to deteriorate,

547
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:01,533
a child could help repair it.

548
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,933
When somebody
is not faithful to their partner,

549
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:09,633
the partners realize that
the relationship cannot be sustained.

550
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,833
Gradual would be
if you met somebody at work

551
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,500
or a new friendship
has occurred, and you...

552
00:33:17,266 --> 00:33:21,566
as it goes on you see that maybe
this relationship has more potential.

553
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:26,933
<i>Anadarko, this is Luke.</i>

554
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,800
Hi, Luke, this is Agent Lee calling

555
00:33:28,866 --> 00:33:30,666
from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.

556
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:32,833
Are you Chris's supervisor?

557
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,100
<i>Yeah, I'm his direct
supervisor, yes.</i>

558
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:38,266
Do you have any idea
if, like, he has like a girlfriend,

559
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:41,366
or if he thought his wife
had a boyfriend or anything like that?

560
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:46,933
<i>He never indicated or said anything
to me that would make me think that.</i>

561
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,200
<i>He never came out
and said that for him or his wife.</i>

562
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:54,566
Sure, okay, can you explain
to me Monday morning?

563
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,000
Where would he go
to go to his job site?

564
00:33:57,566 --> 00:34:00,433
<i>He was out on
what's called the Cervi Ranch.</i>

565
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,100
- Cervi, is that what you said?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

566
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,633
- Okay.
- <i>We have several wells out there.</i>

567
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,600
<i>He and a few of my other guys were
out there pretty much all day with him.</i>

568
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:12,000
Do you have any concerns about him?

569
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:15,400
<i>I don't, other than what
he's going through right now.</i>

570
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:29,966
Go ahead and have
a seat right here, Chris.

571
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:31,733
- Sit on this?
- Yep, I know.

572
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,800
I'll explain what that is in a little bit,
but you don't have to worry.

573
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:36,946
It's not on or anything right now.
It's not gonna...

574
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,866
It's not gonna buzz you or anything.

575
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:40,466
I've never done this before.

576
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:42,700
I know, a lot of people
haven't had polygraphs before.

577
00:34:42,766 --> 00:34:44,633
It's not a normal thing
that people go through.

578
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,833
We're gonna first start by going over
from the beginning and telling someone.

579
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,633
Maybe, you know,
a friend that you hadn't talked to

580
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,166
since any of this has happened,

581
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:56,733
and you're basically going to relay
all the details of exactly what happened.

582
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,200
So, like, I woke her up
after I got ready and everything,

583
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,733
and then we had a talk about, like, uh...

584
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:06,033
selling the house, and about separation.

585
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:08,566
Did she accuse you of anything?

586
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:12,133
I mean, being a woman, I mean,
she's like, "Is there somebody else?"

587
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,600
I'm like, "No, there's nobody else.
I mean, this is...

588
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,500
This is me talking to you about it.

589
00:35:16,566 --> 00:35:20,733
This isn't, like, somebody
came into my life and took me from you.

590
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,066
This is, you know, me talking to you."

591
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:26,300
Okay. So I want you to have confidence

592
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:28,933
in the fact that you had nothing to do
with this disappearance.

593
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,400
We're gonna find that out today.

594
00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:33,600
And obviously, I mean,
I hope that you know

595
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:36,566
if you did have something
to do with their disappearance,

596
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:39,966
it would be really stupid for you
to come in and take a polygraph today.

597
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:42,800
- Exactly.
- Right? Like, it would be really dumb.

598
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:45,700
Like, you should not be here
right now sitting in this chair

599
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:50,166
if you had anything to do with Shanann
and the little girls' disappearance. Okay?

600
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,866
We're just handing out
flyers on this missing person.

601
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,233
Uh, okay.

602
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,233
If you see them, know them,

603
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,433
or if you have cameras on your house
that might have seen something...

604
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,900
- It's a mess.
- It is.

605
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:08,633
- Do they think she's in the area?
- We don't know. I don't...

606
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,566
I got nothing for you on that one, so...

607
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:13,766
...a flyer with a missing lady
and her kiddos? Do you know her?

608
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,633
There's a phone number
at the bottom,

609
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,500
give us a call if you find anything, okay?

610
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:20,666
Police are canvassing
a small town with a big mystery.

611
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:23,600
The disappearance of a pregnant
Frederick woman and her two children

612
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,106
has captured the nation's attention.

613
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:28,433
This is a very visible effort
on the part of Frederick police

614
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,466
to make sure the word
is out about Shanann.

615
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:34,733
Obviously, they said,
"We want to leave no stone unturned.

616
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,666
We don't want to rule anything out."

617
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:39,033
Neighbors I talked to say this is scary.

618
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,533
They want some answers,

619
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,733
but right now all we have
are a lot of questions.

620
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,700
I'm just concerned,
and Shanann, if you're hearing this

621
00:36:47,766 --> 00:36:49,300
or you're out there,

622
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:51,866
please, please let somebody know
you're okay.

623
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,433
The coolest thing about this is right now,

624
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,466
there's only one person in this room
that knows what the truth is,

625
00:36:57,533 --> 00:37:00,500
and in about five minutes,
there's gonna be two of us.

626
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:01,966
That's the coolest part, okay?

627
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:04,333
And then I'm gonna go
share that with them out there.

628
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
- Okay?
- Okay.

629
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:09,000
The test is about to begin.
Please remain still.

630
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,700
Regarding Shanann's disappearance,
do you intend to answer

631
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:15,066
- all of the questions truthfully?
- Yes.

632
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,766
- Is your first name Christopher?
- Yes.

633
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,933
Did you physically cause
Shanann's disappearance?

634
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
No.

635
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:27,933
Are you lying about the last time
you saw Shanann?

636
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
No.

637
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:34,566
I really need your breathing to be normal.
You are, like, all over the place so far.

638
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:35,633
I'm sorry.

639
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:37,633
- That's okay.
- Like, sometimes I feel, like,

640
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,533
I'm not breathing enough,
and I'm, like, uh...

641
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:43,533
- Like that. I don't want it to be that.
- Yeah, yeah.

642
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:50,166
Before 2018, did you ever say
anything out of anger to a loved one?

643
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,466
Yes. Uh, no.

644
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:56,933
- Do you know where Shanann is now?
- No.

645
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:03,433
Did you physically cause
Shanann's disappearance?

646
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
No.

647
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:09,600
Are you lying about the last time
you saw Shanann?

648
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:10,666
No.

649
00:38:17,766 --> 00:38:21,666
All right, how'd you feel?
Same through all of it?

650
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,900
I think I was the same through everything.

651
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:24,966
Good for you.

652
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,300
- It's kind of hard to relax.
- I know. I get it.

653
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm in North Carolina,
those of you that are watching.

654
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:41,466
Go get Uncle Frankie!

655
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,066
Go get Uncle Frankie!

656
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:46,633
Go get him!

657
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,300
Shanann and the kids were
in North Carolina to see my family,

658
00:38:50,366 --> 00:38:52,633
and obviously her family,
and just kind of, like...

659
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,733
'Cause they hadn't seen
the kids in a while.

660
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,300
And I was here
just going to work and working out

661
00:38:58,366 --> 00:39:00,133
and just keeping the house up.

662
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,666
- Can I see, CeCe?
- CeCe, let Bella have one.

663
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,166
CeCe, let me see the frog.

664
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:52,400
She's not getting her.

665
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:56,066
She's like, "You growl, bark at me?"

666
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:59,400
<i>My daddy is a hero</i>

667
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:02,833
<i>He helps me grow up strong</i>

668
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,366
<i>He reads me books</i>

669
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:07,433
<i>He ties my shoes</i>

670
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,733
<i>You're a hero, through and through</i>

671
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,000
My flight was July 31st.

672
00:40:14,066 --> 00:40:17,866
And I flew out there for a week,
so I could fly back with them.

673
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,933
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

674
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:40,033
Can't run.

675
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,833
- Now, I can hug you. Come here.
- Daddy.

676
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,200
Come here, little girls.

677
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,166
Hey. Hey.

678
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,033
Daddy was on a plane.

679
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,100
Airplane?

680
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:58,400
I know.

681
00:40:58,466 --> 00:40:59,700
You went on an airplane?

682
00:40:59,766 --> 00:41:00,766
I did.

683
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:02,600
You did?

684
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:03,666
Yes, I did.

685
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:11,300
Hey, everybody. So, this is the girls'
first time to the beach.

686
00:41:11,366 --> 00:41:13,366
Come here, girls. Get on the sand.

687
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:16,466
Wowee. Look at that.

688
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,666
You like the sand, CeCe?

689
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:22,500
Yeah? You wanna go by the lifeguard?

690
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:24,866
Not yet, Bella.

691
00:41:25,466 --> 00:41:26,833
CeCe, come here.

692
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:30,166
Bella, come here first.
Let's go over here. Let's go find...

693
00:41:30,233 --> 00:41:31,700
a spot so we can sit.

694
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,066
-No, no no!

695
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,000
Turn her slightly this way.
I wanna get a picture.

696
00:42:14,066 --> 00:42:15,500
Turn her slightly this way.

697
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:19,300
Good job, B!

698
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,633
No, no, CeCe, let Pop Pop help you.

699
00:42:26,866 --> 00:42:27,866
All right, CeCe.

700
00:43:57,566 --> 00:44:01,866
I brought Graham in here, 'cause we wanted
to talk to you about the results, okay?

701
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,066
So, um, it is completely clear that you
were not honest during the testing,

702
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:14,066
and I think you already know that.
Um, you did not pass the polygraph test.

703
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:15,000
Okay.

704
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:18,400
Okay, so, now we need to talk about
what actually happened,

705
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:21,066
and I feel like
you're probably ready to do that.

706
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:24,933
I didn't... I didn't lie to you
on that polygraph, I promise.

707
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:26,966
- Chris...
- I'm... I'm not...

708
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:28,200
Time to stop.

709
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,166
- It's time.
- I'm...

710
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:32,200
Just stop for a minute,
take a deep breath.

711
00:44:33,466 --> 00:44:35,900
I want you to take
a deep breath right now.

712
00:44:42,433 --> 00:44:44,900
There's a reason
you feel sick to your stomach.

713
00:44:44,966 --> 00:44:48,533
When people hold stuff inside,
it makes you physically ill.

714
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:53,233
I can just tell on your face. I could
tell from the second that you walked in

715
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,266
that you were wanting to...

716
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,500
just come clean
and just be done with this.

717
00:44:58,233 --> 00:45:01,433
And I appreciate that, because you knew,
sitting down in that chair,

718
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,200
that you weren't gonna pass today.

719
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:06,066
And you knew I was gonna find out,
'cause I told you that,

720
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:11,600
and then you continued to stay,
knowing that you could at the end say,

721
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:14,566
"You know, what?
I just need to get this off my chest.

722
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:17,333
Like, I just wanna tell you
what happened."

723
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,066
We're not here to play games.
We're not here to do any of that with you.

724
00:45:21,133 --> 00:45:22,700
We just want to know what happened.

725
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,933
So, can you start from the beginning
and tell us what happened?

726
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:31,466
Everything that I told you...
I did not lie on this polygraph.

727
00:45:31,533 --> 00:45:36,366
I am... I don't know how much I could...
I... could tell you right now.

728
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,766
- Like, I did not...
- Chris, it's not even an option right now.

729
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:42,633
You did not pass the polygraph.
I know you were being deceptive.

730
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,366
So, that's not even an issue right now.
The issue right now is

731
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:48,133
what happened to Shanann...

732
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,566
Bella, and Celeste.

733
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,666
That's the issue right now.

734
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:55,333
- Okay.
- Okay, so, let's talk about that.

735
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:59,833
CeCe, you're making me more sad,
because I miss Uncle Frankie.

736
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,066
I miss him.

737
00:46:03,766 --> 00:46:05,266
Can we go visit Frankie?

738
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:06,533
What's wrong, baby?

739
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,100
I miss Uncle Frankie.

740
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,600
You miss Uncle Frankie?

741
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:10,666
Yes.

742
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:12,233
Where's the truck going?

743
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,833
To the airplane!

744
00:46:16,366 --> 00:46:19,533
That's the wrong way, Bella.
Wrong way.

745
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,233
That would've been funny.

746
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:26,633
Turn your bag so it's easy.
This way. You gotta carry it.

747
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,100
Missed you, Dieter.

748
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,300
I love my Dieter dog.

749
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,133
<i>Today's date is August 15, 2018.</i>

750
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,033
<i>Interviewing, uh... Nichol Kessinger.</i>

751
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,133
<i>There's a whole bunch of us
working on this,</i>

752
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,000
<i>and we will until we resolve it.</i>

753
00:48:34,066 --> 00:48:37,166
<i>He has no idea that I'm talking
to you guys. Nobody does.</i>

754
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:38,900
<i>I think he's a really good guy,</i>

755
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:42,966
<i>and, you know, I'm worried
about his wife and kids.</i>

756
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:45,200
<i>And we appreciate any insight.</i>

757
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:48,866
<i>So, I met Chris at work,</i>

758
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:51,300
<i>probably around the beginning of June.</i>

759
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,866
<i>And he informed me
that he did have two daughters.</i>

760
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,900
<i>Um, he also told me
that he was currently in the process</i>

761
00:48:59,966 --> 00:49:02,333
<i>of the separation from his wife,</i>

762
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,700
<i>and that's how it started.</i>

763
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:04,933
<i>Sure, okay,</i>

764
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,066
<i>and then did your relationship develop
beyond friendship?</i>

765
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,366
<i>Yes.</i>

766
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:13,900
You're so damn sexy.

767
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,633
Thank you so much for coming
out here with me, Christopher.

768
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:23,600
I'm having a wonderful time.
You mean a lot to me.

769
00:49:24,466 --> 00:49:28,366
And I'm glad that you're having a blast.
I am so out of breath.

770
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:35,233
<i>One thing I did wanna
let you guys know is that...</i>

771
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,066
<i>I found out that she is 15 weeks pregnant.</i>

772
00:49:38,866 --> 00:49:42,966
<i>I did not know that. Uh, I had
to find that out through the media.</i>

773
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:48,166
<i>It's really concerning me that this woman
and her children cannot be located.</i>

774
00:49:48,233 --> 00:49:53,200
<i>It's... it's not okay. It scares me,
and I'm worried for all of them.</i>

775
00:49:55,866 --> 00:49:58,600
This is where
the rubber meets the road, Chris.

776
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:02,100
Like, don't let this
continue any longer, please.

777
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,366
I'm not trying to make anything continue.

778
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:07,933
I want them back home like...

779
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,800
But you know they're not
coming back home. You know that.

780
00:50:12,866 --> 00:50:16,066
I don't know... in the back of my head
I hope they come back home.

781
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,400
- But you know they're not.
- Uh, I hope they come back home.

782
00:50:23,033 --> 00:50:24,700
We just can't figure out...

783
00:50:25,866 --> 00:50:27,366
why there's two Chrises.

784
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:29,666
So we need to talk about that, okay?

785
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:31,033
I cheated on her.

786
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
I know.

787
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,533
That five weeks I was alone,
I was with her most of the time.

788
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:41,866
She's a wonderful person.
I mean, she knew I was married, yes.

789
00:50:41,933 --> 00:50:44,500
I told her we were going
through issues, yes.

790
00:50:44,566 --> 00:50:46,533
I told her that we were gonna get...

791
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,000
At the end, we were gonna be separated.
Like, once I figured out what that was.

792
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:54,266
I didn't know what that was gonna be.
I saw her, took my breath away, and...

793
00:50:54,366 --> 00:50:57,166
I'd never thought
in a million years that could happen.

794
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,166
I'm not proud of it.
Shanann accused me of it, I denied it.

795
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:10,666
I didn't hurt her. I cheated on her.
I hurt her emotionally. I cheated on her.

796
00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:14,266
Here's the challenge that we have.

797
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:18,333
We knew about Nikki and so we didn't need
to ask you about her in the polygraph.

798
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,133
I don't think this girl
did anything to hurt anybody.

799
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,066
- We can leave her out of it.
- Okay. Okay.

800
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:27,300
And get back
to your wife and daughters.

801
00:51:27,366 --> 00:51:29,633
- These are your baby girls.
- My girls.

802
00:51:30,066 --> 00:51:32,100
And you have not shed one tear.

803
00:51:32,466 --> 00:51:36,000
Don't look into that, like,
I don't love my kids or my wife.

804
00:51:36,066 --> 00:51:38,866
Explain to me. You're crying
with your wife that you're leaving her.

805
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:39,766
Yeah.

806
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,900
But you don't cry that your two little
baby girls are missing?

807
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,500
I'm hoping they're
still around somewhere.

808
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:47,000
But you don't have them right now.

809
00:51:47,066 --> 00:51:48,966
You're not reading
stories to them at night.

810
00:51:49,033 --> 00:51:51,633
- I know.
- You're not giving them midnight snacks.

811
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,233
- I love those girls to death.
- Then show us that.

812
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,666
Show us that.

813
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:59,600
- Chris, did Shanann do something to them?
- No, I don't know.

814
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,233
- I'm serious.
- I have no clue.

815
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,333
No, you would've known,
'cause they didn't leave the house.

816
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,800
- I think when...
- Did Shanann do something to them?

817
00:52:06,866 --> 00:52:09,866
And then did you feel like you
had to do something to Shanann?

818
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:13,300
Chicks are crazy.

819
00:52:13,366 --> 00:52:15,266
Can I talk to my dad or something?

820
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:18,200
Absolutely. Do you want
to bring him in here?

821
00:52:18,266 --> 00:52:22,266
No, I just can't talk to my dad.
Like, he flew across the country.

822
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,320
- Hey, Chris. How about this?
- I can't... I'm...

823
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:30,366
If we bring your dad in here,
would you please tell him what happened?

824
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,100
Can I just go talk to him out there?

825
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:37,766
I've been in here for like,
five or six hours and I'm, like...

826
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:41,200
Absolutely.
He deserves an answer.

827
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,033
He's your best friend.

828
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:56,366
Hey, Chris, we're gonna let you
have as much time you need, okay?

829
00:52:56,433 --> 00:52:58,100
Okay.
You're gonna leave us in here?

830
00:52:58,166 --> 00:52:59,600
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah.

831
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:00,666
Okay.

832
00:53:05,233 --> 00:53:07,300
- I'm not gonna tell anyone.
- I know.

833
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:13,833
You gonna tell me what's going on, or...

834
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,466
I messed up the polygraph.

835
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,400
I failed it.

836
00:53:19,733 --> 00:53:21,533
- Failed it?
- Yeah, because there's...

837
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:23,033
Too much emotions?

838
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,433
So, I mean they're...

839
00:53:27,933 --> 00:53:29,566
not gonna let me go.

840
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:36,366
Is there any reason why they shouldn't?

841
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:40,000
They know I had an affair.

842
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:43,100
They... they... they know.

843
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:45,766
I came clean about that.

844
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,833
Is there anything else you wanna tell me?
What's going on or what happened,

845
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,766
or anything you can think of?

846
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,400
When...

847
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:58,566
we had that conversation that morning,

848
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:02,833
it was emotional, and...

849
00:54:03,766 --> 00:54:06,006
I told her about the separation
and everything like that.

850
00:54:06,066 --> 00:54:07,233
Mmm-hmm.

851
00:54:12,366 --> 00:54:14,333
- I don't want to protect her.
- What?

852
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,933
I don't want to protect her.

853
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,633
You don't want to protect her?

854
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,166
I don't know what else to say.

855
00:54:23,766 --> 00:54:25,300
Do you know what happened?

856
00:54:26,066 --> 00:54:27,066
What?

857
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,100
- Did she hurt them?
- Yeah.

858
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,000
And then I had to kill her.

859
00:54:34,066 --> 00:54:35,133
What now?

860
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,533
- I have to tell them I hurt her.
- You hurt her?

861
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,033
So, she started hurting the kids?

862
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Help me, Chris. What happened?

863
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,500
She...

864
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,666
- She...
- What?

865
00:54:57,733 --> 00:55:00,066
- She smothered them.
- She smothered them?

866
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,400
Or choked them?

867
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,200
Did she kill them?

868
00:55:07,633 --> 00:55:09,866
They were... they were blue.

869
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:13,533
Both of them?
She choked both of them to death?

870
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:16,333
I freaked out
and did the same thing to her.

871
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:19,266
Oh, my God.

872
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:26,800
So, she killed both CeCe and Bella,
choked them to death?

873
00:55:32,466 --> 00:55:35,266
And you lost it
and then choked her, or...

874
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,433
Mmm-hmm. I just... that was just...

875
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:40,033
rage. I mean, I hadn't...

876
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:46,033
Good God almighty, son.

877
00:55:58,266 --> 00:56:00,700
I am live right now outside the home

878
00:56:00,766 --> 00:56:04,300
of Chris Watts and Shanann Watts,
and you can see behind me,

879
00:56:04,366 --> 00:56:08,300
police are here right now, processing
the evidence inside the home.

880
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,633
Folks are here
to pick up the dog.

881
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,266
I'll try to catch her first.

882
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,433
Yep.

883
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,300
Police have been towing a truck

884
00:56:20,366 --> 00:56:22,666
that was parked
just a couple of houses down.

885
00:56:22,733 --> 00:56:26,033
We didn't know it's connected
to the house, but they towed that as well.

886
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,866
And they just came out
with the family's dog in a cage.

887
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:32,666
Police have also went in there
with evidence bags.

888
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,033
- What's that?
- Tell them.

889
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:45,500
You doing okay? You sure?

890
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:58,466
You did the hard part.

891
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,500
All you have left
is to tell us where they're at.

892
00:57:02,566 --> 00:57:04,433
We can help you get them out of the cold.

893
00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:09,333
They're gone.
There's no bringing them back.

894
00:57:10,233 --> 00:57:11,600
Well, where are they?

895
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,266
They're at the first location
I went to that day.

896
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:26,666
Where did you put them out there?
Chris, that's really important.

897
00:57:27,433 --> 00:57:30,409
- I didn't know what else to do.
- I know, just tell me, where are the kids?

898
00:57:30,433 --> 00:57:31,300
I know.

899
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:34,566
I didn't know what else to do.
I was so scared.

900
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:35,633
I know.

901
00:57:36,633 --> 00:57:37,833
Will you show us?

902
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,666
What's going to happen?

903
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,300
We're gonna help them get out of there.

904
00:57:43,233 --> 00:57:45,514
Chris, I know they're gone,
but they're still your babies.

905
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:47,809
- You're still their dad.
- You don't want them out there.

906
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:49,466
I don't want them out there.

907
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:56,500
And you don't want someone else to find
them out there. You don't, I promise you.

908
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,766
Can you give us a second,
so we can get some... things arranged?

909
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,100
Can you do that?

910
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:08,900
Ronnie, do you want
to stay in here with him?

911
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,033
The problem is I don't even know
if they believe me or not.

912
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:31,766
- Are they buried in something or...
- Shanann is.

913
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:36,566
What about the babies?

914
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:41,066
That's what I'm worried about.
They're in a freaking oil tank.

915
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,500
I didn't know what else to do.

916
00:58:50,066 --> 00:58:52,933
Please, God... forgive me.

917
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,000
I think we have a picture of,
is it Cervi 319?

918
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,300
Does that look familiar to you?
What is that?

919
00:59:07,366 --> 00:59:09,900
That's Cervi 319.

920
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:10,966
Okay.

921
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:12,633
Whereabouts...

922
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:15,500
is Shanann and the girls?

923
00:59:18,366 --> 00:59:20,166
How old is this picture?

924
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:21,933
- Today.
- Oh, it's today?

925
00:59:24,733 --> 00:59:25,900
Shanann's right here.

926
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,533
Is that "S" for Shanann, okay,
and where are the girls at?

927
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,300
They're in here.

928
00:59:35,433 --> 00:59:37,066
Are they in the tanks?

929
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:41,033
They're like...
there's just a hatch on the top,

930
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,233
and they're, like, 20 foot tanks.

931
00:59:45,933 --> 00:59:48,466
- There was a sheet found down here.
- Mmm-hmm.

932
00:59:48,533 --> 00:59:49,966
What is that from?

933
00:59:50,666 --> 00:59:52,800
That was
what Shanann was wrapped in.

934
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,666
You're good with the public
knowing Shanann killed her daughters?

935
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:04,100
I did not hurt these girls.

936
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:06,400
You okay with the public
knowing that Shanann...

937
01:00:06,466 --> 01:00:08,333
Yes, because I did not hurt these girls.

938
01:00:11,966 --> 01:00:13,733
What it looks like is that...

939
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,200
you got a new life...

940
01:00:16,966 --> 01:00:20,066
and the only way to get that new life
was to get rid of the old life.

941
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:25,200
And I think that you killed these girls
before their mom came home

942
01:00:25,266 --> 01:00:27,466
- and then killed Shanann.
- No, no, no.

943
01:00:28,033 --> 01:00:31,466
It just doesn't make sense.
It just doesn't add up.

944
01:00:31,933 --> 01:00:35,100
So... either you're this monster,

945
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,200
"So, I just want this young,
hot girlfriend,

946
01:00:38,266 --> 01:00:41,866
so I'm gonna kill everyone
and hope it works out," or something.

947
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:46,566
So, I think we're
very, very close to the truth,

948
01:00:46,633 --> 01:00:48,000
but not quite there yet.

949
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:55,666
- So, if you're not that monster...
- I'm not a monster.

950
01:00:55,733 --> 01:00:56,733
I didn't...

951
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,633
kill my babies.

952
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,700
Okay.

953
01:01:10,866 --> 01:01:14,933
<i>On August 10, Shanann
flew out to Arizona with Nickole.</i>

954
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,433
<i>And I had the kids
from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.</i>

955
01:01:20,866 --> 01:01:22,366
<i>How long have you known Shanann?</i>

956
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:24,300
<i>Three to four years,
I would say.</i>

957
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,133
<i>So, you guys... was there, like,
a convention this last weekend?</i>

958
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,900
<i>There was a training in Arizona</i>

959
01:01:28,966 --> 01:01:31,600
<i>that some of the top leaders
of the company were putting on.</i>

960
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:32,666
<i>Okay.</i>

961
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:34,833
<i>So, you picked her up from her house.</i>

962
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,600
<i>She was waiting
on the front porch.</i>

963
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:37,666
<i>Oh, she was, okay.</i>

964
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,200
<i>Then we drove to the airport.</i>

965
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:41,066
<i>Do you remember
when you picked her up?</i>

966
01:01:41,133 --> 01:01:42,266
<i>It was around 4:30.</i>

967
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:43,566
<i>- In the morning?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

968
01:02:48,133 --> 01:02:50,833
Chris, come stand up for me.

969
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,733
I'm gonna have you
face that wall over there.

970
01:02:54,433 --> 01:02:56,166
That one, just face it.

971
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,500
Lift up your hands.

972
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:13,800
In just the last ten minutes,

973
01:03:13,866 --> 01:03:16,166
we have confirmed that Shanann's husband

974
01:03:16,233 --> 01:03:19,933
and the father of her two children,
Chris Watts, has confessed.

975
01:03:29,866 --> 01:03:33,233
Neighbors here, some of them are still
outside tonight. They're all on edge.

976
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,933
They are saddened by this horrific news
if this indeed is the case.

977
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,066
Sir. Can you step over here
for me, please?

978
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:43,333
Face this bar right here.
Sir, you got anything on you?

979
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:00,066
At this point,
we have been able to recover

980
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:04,066
a body that we're quite certain
is Shanann Watts' body.

981
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:06,300
We have strong reason to believe

982
01:04:06,366 --> 01:04:09,333
that we know where the bodies
of the children are,

983
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,400
and recovery efforts
are in process on that.

984
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:18,466
This is absolutely the worst possible
outcome that any of us could imagine.

985
01:04:23,533 --> 01:04:27,200
Thank you everyone
for coming out to the candlelight vigil,

986
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,533
and saying all your prayers.
They are greatly appreciated.

987
01:04:33,033 --> 01:04:35,833
And keep the prayers coming
for our family.

988
01:05:21,966 --> 01:05:23,433
You talk about...

989
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:27,666
children, and he's got his own kids,

990
01:05:27,733 --> 01:05:29,166
and that makes you uncomfortable,

991
01:05:29,233 --> 01:05:31,500
because you'd like to have
your own family.

992
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,300
Put that in context for me.

993
01:05:34,366 --> 01:05:37,300
Is that... is that a fair statement,
the way I'm saying it?

994
01:05:38,366 --> 01:05:41,633
I mean, I guess, but that was never
anything I, like, said to him, though.

995
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:46,300
Okay, that's what I wanted to know.
Did you ever say anything to him about...

996
01:05:46,366 --> 01:05:48,033
Never, never...

997
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,633
- Anything about his kids being a problem?
- No.

998
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:54,100
- Anything about his wife being a problem?
- Never, never.

999
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:58,666
This shocked me just as much as
I think it shocked the rest of the world.

1000
01:05:59,866 --> 01:06:00,866
All of it.

1001
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:02,633
Like, he lies so much.

1002
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:06,166
Now, I go back and think of all the shit,
and I'm like, "It's lies."

1003
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:09,266
I really thought she left. I was like...

1004
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,100
"Let her fucking go.
You know, she'll come back in a day."

1005
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:16,500
"She'll get right. Let her cool down.
She'll be here. It'll be okay."

1006
01:06:16,566 --> 01:06:19,366
You know, like, had me convinced, like,

1007
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:22,166
"I think she's just upset."
And then... and then...

1008
01:06:26,033 --> 01:06:29,033
Um, all right,
we can move past that.

1009
01:06:29,566 --> 01:06:33,133
Did you meet at your house?
Did you guys go to any restaurants?

1010
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,866
Did you go to establishments?

1011
01:06:35,966 --> 01:06:37,466
He came to my house,

1012
01:06:37,533 --> 01:06:41,466
and this past Saturday, we went to, um...

1013
01:06:41,533 --> 01:06:44,300
What's the name of that bar
that we used to go to?

1014
01:06:44,366 --> 01:06:46,500
It's not the same... the Lazy Dog.

1015
01:06:46,566 --> 01:06:49,100
So, he had to get a babysitter that night.

1016
01:06:50,633 --> 01:06:54,266
Chris said he went
to a Rockies game on Saturday night.

1017
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:55,733
They got a babysitter.

1018
01:06:56,533 --> 01:06:59,766
And then she checked her bank statement
and he went out to dinner,

1019
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:02,433
which, that's not odd,
but the total was 60-some dollars.

1020
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,500
- You remember where that was?
- The Lazy Dog in Westminster.

1021
01:07:06,466 --> 01:07:10,066
- It's like a bar and grill type...
- You'd have to work at it to get 65 bucks.

1022
01:07:10,133 --> 01:07:12,400
Yeah, well, that's what
we were talking about.

1023
01:07:12,466 --> 01:07:15,333
So, then she gets off the phone with him,
and we come back.

1024
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,333
She's upset and she was like,
"Well, what did he spend that on?"

1025
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,976
And I'm... "Food. Like, I don't know,"
and she looked up the menu.

1026
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,933
He said he had salmon and a beer,
and she's like, "That's only 30 bucks.

1027
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,833
Where's the other 40 dollars?"

1028
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,066
So, then she started
going through their bank statement

1029
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:30,700
to see if there was any other
kind of charges while she was gone.

1030
01:07:30,766 --> 01:07:33,833
We went back to my house for
a little bit, and then he had to leave.

1031
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,600
Do you recall the time he left?

1032
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:38,666
I remember he was, like,
gonna be late to be back at 10:00.

1033
01:07:38,733 --> 01:07:43,166
I think there's a text message where he
starts texting me when he's at his house.

1034
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:46,066
I remember, I texted him back,
and I was like, "Damn, that was quick."

1035
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:49,233
He's like, "Yeah, I even had time to stop
at the gas station to get money

1036
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,466
to pay the babysitter."

1037
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:53,733
He didn't get home until 10:30,
which she found that to be odd,

1038
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,800
because it was well after dinner.

1039
01:07:57,066 --> 01:07:58,700
And she knows when he gets home,

1040
01:07:58,766 --> 01:08:01,366
because their security system
tells you when you open the door.

1041
01:08:04,933 --> 01:08:08,700
A Colorado man charged in the murders
of his pregnant wife and two daughters

1042
01:08:08,766 --> 01:08:10,366
will be back in court today,

1043
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:14,800
but in an unsealed affidavit, he says
he is not the one who killed his children.

1044
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:18,533
I was just hoping
he would be man enough today

1045
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,866
to just be like, "Know what?
This is what happened."

1046
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:23,300
There's no doubt in my mind.

1047
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:26,433
My sister would never,
ever, ever hurt her children.

1048
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,733
She loved her kids, loved them
more than anything in this world.

1049
01:08:30,633 --> 01:08:33,800
Chris Watts learned
that he could get life in prison

1050
01:08:33,866 --> 01:08:36,533
without the possibility
of parole or death.

1051
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,966
Lots of you have asked about when
the death penalty decision will be made.

1052
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:43,100
That is not something that's going
to happen, even in the next few weeks.

1053
01:08:44,633 --> 01:08:49,933
There is so much being said online
in the dozens of Facebook groups

1054
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,066
and the tens of thousands of followers
of these Facebook groups, these members.

1055
01:08:55,133 --> 01:09:01,200
Everyone is tearing each piece
of interaction between this couple apart.

1056
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:04,900
I just have to wonder
if she even wanted Bella and CeCe.

1057
01:09:04,966 --> 01:09:07,933
Her parent-raising ideas
were disturbing.

1058
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,400
The one that I would
label the narcissist is Shanann.

1059
01:09:11,466 --> 01:09:14,466
I think she drove him
to lose his shit.

1060
01:09:14,533 --> 01:09:16,866
Oh, my God,
she did not drive him to do this shit.

1061
01:09:16,933 --> 01:09:18,000
She did, she did.

1062
01:09:18,066 --> 01:09:20,300
You don't know what
went on behind closed doors.

1063
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:21,566
She drove him insane.

1064
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:24,000
Come on,
why are you victim-blaming?

1065
01:09:24,066 --> 01:09:25,633
She was a bitch.

1066
01:09:26,866 --> 01:09:30,066
There are people out there
who believe he is innocent.

1067
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:33,233
And those conspiracy theorists
are using social media

1068
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,900
to relentlessly attack Shanann's family.

1069
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:38,742
Shanann's father, Frank Rzucek,
says his daughter and his grandchildren

1070
01:09:38,766 --> 01:09:40,300
have been ridiculed,

1071
01:09:40,366 --> 01:09:44,366
demeaned, slandered, and mocked
in the most vicious ways you can imagine.

1072
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:49,133
Please just stop.
Get on with your lives.

1073
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,200
Leave ours alone.

1074
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:56,766
One, two, three. Four, Daddy!

1075
01:09:57,766 --> 01:09:58,766
Five!

1076
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,200
Six.

1077
01:10:14,066 --> 01:10:16,633
She called him that night
when we were at the airport.

1078
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,740
She's like, "Will you watch my stuff,
I'm gonna go talk to Chris real quick."

1079
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:22,776
She came back, it couldn't
have been more than five minutes.

1080
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,466
I said, "Are you okay?" She's like, "No."

1081
01:10:24,533 --> 01:10:28,400
She's like, "I haven't talked to him
all day or hardly at all this weekend,

1082
01:10:28,466 --> 01:10:30,033
and he wants to work out.

1083
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,666
He started working out
while he was on the phone with me.

1084
01:10:32,766 --> 01:10:34,133
So, I just let him go!"

1085
01:11:47,966 --> 01:11:50,400
I dropped her off around 1:45.

1086
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:54,000
Then I went home
and I didn't talk to her again that night.

1087
01:12:15,366 --> 01:12:17,066
Good afternoon, everyone.

1088
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:19,200
For those of you not present
in the courtroom today,

1089
01:12:19,266 --> 01:12:22,500
I want to take a minute to summarize
the nature of the proceedings

1090
01:12:22,566 --> 01:12:25,266
on <i>People v. Christopher Watts</i>
this afternoon.

1091
01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:31,333
Mr. Watts entered a plea of guilty
to all nine counts. Those counts include

1092
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,900
murder in the first degree
after deliberation as to Shanann Watts,

1093
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:38,333
murder in the first degree
as to Bella Watts,

1094
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,366
murder in the first degree
as to Celeste Watts,

1095
01:12:41,433 --> 01:12:45,333
unlawful termination of a pregnancy
as it relates to Nico Watts,

1096
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,366
and three counts of unlawful,
tampering with a deceased human body.

1097
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:54,166
As a result of his plea of guilty,
he will not face the death penalty.

1098
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:57,933
Sandi said it very, very poignantly to me.

1099
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,566
"He made the choice to take those lives.

1100
01:13:00,633 --> 01:13:03,400
I do not want to be in a position
of making the choice to take his."

1101
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,966
The last thing we talked
about was where the girls were.

1102
01:13:13,466 --> 01:13:15,966
But we never really got
to talk about that night.

1103
01:13:21,233 --> 01:13:23,166
<i>She got home,
like, at two o'clock.</i>

1104
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,033
<i>I just had a feeling that she knew, like,</i>

1105
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,900
<i>you know, what I did.</i>

1106
01:13:27,966 --> 01:13:29,566
<i>Saturday night was the last straw.</i>

1107
01:13:31,433 --> 01:13:35,100
<i>Going out with somebody
and using our actual bank account card,</i>

1108
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:37,533
<i>and just, like,
not trying to hide it at all.</i>

1109
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,266
<i>I felt her get into bed.</i>

1110
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,066
<i>She started rubbing her hand on me,
and we ended up having sex.</i>

1111
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,666
<i>When I woke up later on in the morning,</i>

1112
01:13:49,733 --> 01:13:52,933
<i>like, you know, I pretty much,
you know, told her, like,</i>

1113
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,366
<i>you know, I didn't think
it was gonna work anymore.</i>

1114
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,233
<i>And she was like, "What happened?
What was last night?" You know?</i>

1115
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:03,433
<i>She was like,
"I knew there was somebody else."</i>

1116
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,000
<i>I couldn't just say,
"Yes, there is somebody else."</i>

1117
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:08,666
<i>Then she said, "You're never
going to see your kids again.</i>

1118
01:14:08,733 --> 01:14:10,766
<i>You're never going to see them again.
Get off me."</i>

1119
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:16,600
<i>If I'd never met Nikki, would I ever
have thought our relationship was bad?</i>

1120
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:17,666
<i>Probably not.</i>

1121
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:20,366
<i>So, then, when did it turn?</i>

1122
01:14:20,433 --> 01:14:22,333
<i>I told her
I didn't love her anymore.</i>

1123
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,500
<i>That's when it happened.</i>

1124
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,266
<i>What happened?</i>

1125
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:28,966
<i>She told me to get off her,
and then I put my hands around her.</i>

1126
01:14:33,566 --> 01:14:35,400
<i>I don't even wanna say
I felt like I had to.</i>

1127
01:14:35,466 --> 01:14:38,076
<i>I felt like it was already something
in my mind that was implanted.</i>

1128
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,933
<i>I was gonna do it when I woke up
that morning, and it was gonna happen.</i>

1129
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,933
<i>I had no control over it.
Why couldn't I just let go?</i>

1130
01:14:44,666 --> 01:14:45,966
<i>What was she doing?</i>

1131
01:14:46,466 --> 01:14:47,666
<i>She wasn't fighting.</i>

1132
01:14:51,466 --> 01:14:53,133
<i>Then Bella came in the room.</i>

1133
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,666
<i>What did she say?</i>

1134
01:14:55,933 --> 01:14:57,600
<i>"What's wrong with Mommy?"</i>

1135
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:01,166
<i>She had her little pink blanket with her.</i>

1136
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,400
<i>And where was
Shanann at that point?</i>

1137
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,500
<i>Pretty much on the bed,
but she was face down.</i>

1138
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,766
<i>I put Shanann in that sheet,
carried her downstairs.</i>

1139
01:15:15,533 --> 01:15:16,800
<i>I pulled my truck up.</i>

1140
01:15:17,633 --> 01:15:19,933
<i>So, you put Shanann in the truck</i>

1141
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,466
<i>and then you put
the two girls in the truck?</i>

1142
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,500
<i>Sitting in the back with the...
like, in that... that bench seat.</i>

1143
01:15:26,566 --> 01:15:28,700
<i>So, Shanann was back there, too?</i>

1144
01:15:28,766 --> 01:15:30,066
<i>On the floor.</i>

1145
01:15:30,133 --> 01:15:33,200
<i>What did they say about
Shanann being on the floor?</i>

1146
01:15:33,266 --> 01:15:35,300
<i>"Is Mommy okay?"</i>

1147
01:15:35,366 --> 01:15:36,800
<i>What'd you tell them?</i>

1148
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:38,666
<i>"She'll be fine."</i>

1149
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,766
<i>When I was driving up there,</i>

1150
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:46,466
<i>they were just sitting there,
kind of asleep or kind of</i>

1151
01:15:46,533 --> 01:15:48,900
<i>just holding onto each other,
laying in each other's laps.</i>

1152
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:53,933
<i>Honestly, like, I try to picture
that whole ride.</i>

1153
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,700
<i>It's like 45 minutes
to an hour ride out there.</i>

1154
01:15:56,766 --> 01:15:58,000
<i>And it's just like...</i>

1155
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,100
<i>couldn't I have, like...</i>

1156
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,200
<i>saved my girls' life?</i>

1157
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:05,133
<i>Couldn't I have done something?
Why did I do it? I don't know.</i>

1158
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,133
<i>I wanted all my life was to be a dad,</i>

1159
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,966
<i>just to have, you know, kids
and they love me, they... all that.</i>

1160
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:13,166
<i>I just haven't... nothing made sense.</i>

1161
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,500
<i>So what happened
when you got out there?</i>

1162
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,833
<i>CeCe was... first.</i>

1163
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,666
<i>I put the blanket over her head.</i>

1164
01:16:23,033 --> 01:16:24,600
<i>Did she struggle at all?</i>

1165
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,700
<i>I don't think so...</i>

1166
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:31,066
<i>Then what happened to Bella?
Tell me what happened there.</i>

1167
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:33,533
<i>She said, "What happened to CeCe?"</i>

1168
01:16:34,766 --> 01:16:36,333
<i>Every time I close my eyes,</i>

1169
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,233
<i>I start to see her saying, "Daddy, no,"
and that was it.</i>

1170
01:16:40,066 --> 01:16:41,500
<i>I hear that every day.</i>

1171
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:54,066
After he disposed of
their bodies, he made several phone calls.

1172
01:16:54,133 --> 01:16:58,266
One was to the school, telling the school
that they were being unenrolled.

1173
01:16:58,733 --> 01:17:02,700
He contacted a realtor to start
discussing the selling of his house,

1174
01:17:02,766 --> 01:17:05,433
and he texted
with his girlfriend about their future.

1175
01:17:06,933 --> 01:17:09,500
None of this answers
the questions of why, however.

1176
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:11,466
If he was this happy

1177
01:17:11,533 --> 01:17:14,100
and wanted a new start, get a divorce.

1178
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:19,266
You don't annihilate your family
and throw them away like garbage.

1179
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:25,300
Why did Nico, Celeste, Bella,
and Shanann have to lose their lives...

1180
01:17:25,366 --> 01:17:27,366
in order for him to get what he wanted?

1181
01:17:28,133 --> 01:17:30,666
Your Honor, Sandi Rzucek
would like to address the court.

1182
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:35,300
I wanted to say thank you
for this moment.

1183
01:17:35,366 --> 01:17:37,933
We loved you like a son. We trusted you.

1184
01:17:38,966 --> 01:17:40,900
Your faithful wife trusted you.

1185
01:17:41,733 --> 01:17:45,200
Your children adored you,
and they also trusted you.

1186
01:17:47,633 --> 01:17:50,300
Your daughter Bella Marie
sang a song proudly.

1187
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,200
I don't know if you got to see it,
but it was "Daddy, You're My Hero."

1188
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:56,733
I have no idea...

1189
01:17:57,633 --> 01:17:59,833
who gave you
the right to take their lives.

1190
01:18:00,966 --> 01:18:01,966
But I know...

1191
01:18:03,133 --> 01:18:05,433
God and his mighty angels were there...

1192
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,133
at that moment
to bring them home to paradise.

1193
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:10,566
Thank you, Your Honor.

1194
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,233
Introduce yourself for the record.

1195
01:18:16,933 --> 01:18:18,466
I'm Cindy Watts.

1196
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:23,766
I am still struggling to understand
how and why this tragedy occurred.

1197
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:29,800
This might be hard for some
to understand how I can sit here

1198
01:18:29,866 --> 01:18:34,500
under these circumstances
and tell you all that we are heartbroken.

1199
01:18:34,566 --> 01:18:38,233
Although we can't imagine
what could have led us to this day.

1200
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
We love you...

1201
01:18:42,366 --> 01:18:44,400
and we forgive you, son.

1202
01:18:45,566 --> 01:18:47,833
Mr. Watts,
as I indicated when we began,

1203
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,766
you have the right to make a statement
if you choose to.

1204
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:52,333
Would you like to make a statement?

1205
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,400
No, sir.

1206
01:18:53,933 --> 01:18:58,200
This is perhaps the most inhumane...

1207
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:01,666
and vicious crime that I have handled

1208
01:19:01,733 --> 01:19:04,500
out of the thousands of cases
that I have seen.

1209
01:19:05,633 --> 01:19:08,366
And anything less than
the maximum sentence

1210
01:19:08,433 --> 01:19:11,266
would depreciate
the seriousness of this offense.

1211
01:19:11,766 --> 01:19:16,700
Deputies, I would respectfully ask
that you take this defendant into custody

1212
01:19:16,766 --> 01:19:20,300
and have him serve the rest of his life
in the Department of Corrections.

1213
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,866
<i>A dramatic showdown
in court today</i>

1214
01:19:26,933 --> 01:19:29,800
<i>as a Colorado man
received three life sentences</i>

1215
01:19:29,866 --> 01:19:32,133
<i>for murdering
his pregnant wife and two daughters</i>

1216
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,200
<i>in a case that shocked the nation.</i>

1217
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:40,300
<i>My daughter, even though
she was pregnant, is a fighter.</i>

1218
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:44,700
<i>I still say he did this
while she was sleeping,</i>

1219
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:49,666
<i>because he would not look the way
he looks right now if she was up.</i>

1220
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,133
<i>What I can tell you
most affirmatively today</i>

1221
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:01,100
<i>is the spotlight that he tried to
shine on Shanann falsely, incorrectly,</i>

1222
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:03,900
and frankly a flat-out lie
has been corrected.

1223
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:07,166
The spotlight shines directly
where it belongs, on him.

1224
01:20:13,633 --> 01:20:15,300
<i>Hi, Stacy, my name's Nickole,</i>

1225
01:20:15,366 --> 01:20:17,933
<i>and I'm calling, because I'm concerned
about a friend of mine.</i>

1226
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,166
- Scott, how you doing?
- How's it going?

1227
01:20:20,233 --> 01:20:21,733
All the girls' blankies are gone.

1228
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,966
- Her phone's here.
- This is her lifeline.

1229
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:33,700
Her wedding ring's here?

1230
01:20:33,766 --> 01:20:35,566
He's not acting right at all.

1231
01:20:35,633 --> 01:20:36,633
No?

1232
01:20:37,733 --> 01:20:39,366
She's pregnant as well, sir.

1233
01:20:39,433 --> 01:20:43,366
Shanann, Bella, Celeste,
if you're out there, just...

1234
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:44,733
just come back.

1235
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,200
I need to see everybody again.

1236
01:20:46,266 --> 01:20:49,433
This house is not complete with...
without anybody here.

1237
01:20:57,033 --> 01:20:59,700
I can say, at the end of the day,
I've done everything

1238
01:20:59,766 --> 01:21:04,566
in my heart and my soul that
I could do to make my family's life better

1239
01:21:04,633 --> 01:21:07,433
and to give my family
what they deserve.

1240
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,800
You guys are so silly.
Okay, let's go to school.

1241
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,700
I love school.

1242
01:21:12,766 --> 01:21:17,800
Because of my health challenges,
because I got so sick,

1243
01:21:17,866 --> 01:21:18,866
I let him in.

1244
01:21:18,933 --> 01:21:21,300
He only knew me at that time.

1245
01:21:21,366 --> 01:21:23,233
He knew me at my worst,

1246
01:21:23,733 --> 01:21:24,966
and he accepted me.

1247
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:29,933
We're not promised tomorrow, you know,
we're not promised anything.

1248
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,300
Oh, my goodness!

1249
01:21:31,366 --> 01:21:36,466
But we'll be able to enjoy our children
and every crazy moment...

1250
01:21:36,533 --> 01:21:38,666
- I love you girls.
- And give the baby a hug!

1251
01:21:38,733 --> 01:21:39,966
You wanna give the baby a hug?

1252
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:43,333
It can be super crazy,
but I love them.

1253

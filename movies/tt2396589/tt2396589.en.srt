00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:55,370
You better get a hurry along.

3
00:00:58,665 --> 00:00:59,916
We ain't gonna make it.

4
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,340
Oh, we will. We have to.

5
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:12,929
Take a break. Come on.

6
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:15,556
My turn.

7
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:36,911
"We will. We have to."

8
00:01:39,622 --> 00:01:41,374
That was my brother, Henry.

9
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:45,837
Absolutely certain
whatever he wanted to happen would.

10
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:52,802
The weather would dry out in time
to resow the cotton.

11
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:58,475
We would get this hole dug
before the storm hit.

12
00:01:58,558 --> 00:02:00,602
God damn it!

13
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:02,145
- Jesus Christ!
- What is it?

14
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,896
It's a slave's grave.

15
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:05,690
How do you know that?

16
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:08,360
Shot in the head.

17
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,570
Must've been a runaway.

18
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:15,367
Well, that settles it.

19
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,451
Settles what?

20
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:19,037
I ain't burying my father
in no slave's grave.

21
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:21,414
Nothing he would've hated more.

22
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:23,500
Help me up.

23
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:27,295
We ain't got a choice.

24
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:41,101
That's it, brother! Come on!

25
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:42,769
- Huh?
- That's it!

26
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:44,229
Get you out of there!

27
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:50,109
Come on!

28
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:54,030
Come on.

29
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:56,241
God damn it!

30
00:02:57,492 --> 00:03:00,912
- Come on, Jamie. Hang on!
- No.

31
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:03,498
I'm gonna fetch a ladder!

32
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:06,334
Huh?

33
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,255
Henry!

34
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:25,395
Henry!

35
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:27,146
Henry!

36
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:29,191
Henry!

37
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:34,737
- Henry, where are you?
- Right here! I'm here!

38
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:38,158
That was my brother Henry.

39
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:42,412
Absolutely certain
whatever he wanted to happen would.

40
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:46,666
And his little brother...

41
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:47,750
Jamie.

42
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:50,503
...would never betray him.

43
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:55,633
Come on. Come here. Come on.
What's the matter with you? Huh?

44
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:59,136
I thought you were...
gonna leave me down there!

45
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:02,265
Come on. Why would I do that?

46
00:04:03,015 --> 00:04:04,642
Why would I do that?

47
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:47,059
When I think of the farm, I think of mud.

48
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:50,897
Encrusting knees and hair.

49
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:55,276
Marching in boot-shaped patches
across the floor.

50
00:04:57,612 --> 00:04:59,572
I dreamed in brown.

51
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:11,167
All right. Come on, lift it up.

52
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,920
- Come on.
- You know, just get... Come on!

53
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:17,006
- Hang on. Just let it... Hang on.
- Hold on.

54
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,926
- Lift it, Jamie. Lift it.
- Just get a little more...

55
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:21,511
Just stop, okay? Let's set it down.

56
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:24,556
Why don't we just run the ropes
lengthwise? We stand at either end.

57
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,224
No, the coffin's too narrow.
If it falls again, it might break.

58
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:29,519
- Well, we can try.
- No!

59
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:34,441
- Hap!
- Henry.

60
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:36,233
- Hap!
- Henry, don't.

61
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:38,277
- It ain't my fault what happened.
- Whoa.

62
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:40,613
- I warned that boy. Warned both of 'em.
- Just let 'em go.

63
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:41,781
Hap!

64
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:43,950
Hap, can you hold on?

65
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:50,957
Can you lend us a hand, Hap?

66
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,127
Need to get that coffin in the ground.

67
00:06:00,758 --> 00:06:01,759
Hap?

68
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:05,763
I was a 31-year-old virgin

69
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:09,476
when I met Henry McAllan
in the spring of 1939.

70
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,230
I lived with my parents
in the house I grew up in.

71
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:17,817
My world was small,

72
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,319
and he was my rescuer
from a life in the margins.

73
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:24,449
Oh, really? He tells me
that, uh, you are actually a college man.

74
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:25,575
Engineering.

75
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:28,995
- An engineering degree from Ole Miss.
- Yes.

76
00:06:29,078 --> 00:06:31,581
Did you hear that, Laura?
An engineering degree from Ole Miss.

77
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:32,957
My, my, my.

78
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,752
You know, Laura is a college graduate.

79
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:38,963
She got her teaching certificate from
West Tennessee State. We're very proud.

80
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:42,008
Mm-hmm. My dear sister's
the smartest one in the family.

81
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:45,178
Made better grades than I ever did.
Never heard the end of it.

82
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,096
She is smart.

83
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:52,769
Laura, you should, uh,
play the piano for us after dinner.

84
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:53,895
Hmm?

85
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:58,149
You should hear her sing.
She sings like an angel.

86
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:00,610
Yeah, you should play something
for Mr. McAllan later.

87
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:02,945
- Mama. Mama.
- "Ave Maria." That's my favorite.

88
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:05,239
- You will love that. It's so beautiful.
- Mama.

89
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:06,574
What?

90
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:09,994
I'm quite sure that Teddy did not bring

91
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:12,372
his new boss, Mr. McAllan,
over to hear hymns.

92
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,583
Well, why don't we just ask him.

93
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,168
- Mr. McAllan?
- Mm-hmm?

94
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:19,962
Would you like to hear some music
after dinner?

95
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,136
I like hymns.

96
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:30,973
He likes hymns.

97
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:37,855
I was unused to male admiration
and knew only that I wanted more.

98
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:42,402
It was at least a reprieve
from the sincere pity

99
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:45,780
and insincere kindness
directed at old maids.

100
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:48,574
- Right.
- So...

101
00:07:48,658 --> 00:07:52,036
He didn't feel the need
to fill the air with words like I did.

102
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:54,288
He had the self-confidence I lacked.

103
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:55,531
- That's it?
- Uh-huh.

104
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,500
Well...

105
00:07:57,584 --> 00:08:00,252
I can't say
I was truly in love with him then...

106
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:05,633
but I was so grateful to him,
it dwarfed everything else.

107
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:11,305
My brother Jamie's coming up
from Oxford next weekend.

108
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,725
I'd like for him to meet you.

109
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:29,616
There he is, right there.

110
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,535
Brother! Brother!

111
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:44,255
- You look good, brother.
- Likewise.

112
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,883
The air up here in Memphis
agrees with you.

113
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,093
Or is it something else?

114
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:52,597
Miss Chappell,
this here is my brother, Jamie.

115
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,974
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleasure's all mine.

116
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:58,144
Oh, he thinks he's one of them characters
in his plays.

117
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:02,690
Yes, but which play is it, dear brother?
Hamlet? Faust? Prince Hal?

118
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:05,192
One of them fellas that could earn you
a decent wage someday.

119
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:07,904
What do you think, Miss Chappell?

120
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:12,199
I think you're more of a Puck.

121
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:15,119
- Who's Puck?
- "Lord, what fools these mortals be."

122
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:16,746
Puck's a kind of mischievous sprite.

123
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:18,665
He's a hobgoblin.

124
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:21,668
Forgive me, brother.
I'm only trying to impress her.

125
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:25,129
Oh, you'll find Miss Laura is not
the impressionable type.

126
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:28,925
- Shall we?
- We shall.

127
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:32,845
I went ahead and told Pappy
you were here today.

128
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,525
Uh-huh.
I wanna hear. I wanna hear.

129
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:48,611
Next thing I knew,
I was sucked under,

130
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:51,989
concussed and bleeding,
and I was as good as gone,

131
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:55,117
another victim of the Great Flood of '27.

132
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:57,829
- I can't believe you never told me this.
- There's more.

133
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:58,996
Then what happened?

134
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,708
Well, I saw a shimmering light,

135
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,591
- like a falling star.
- "Shimmering."

136
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:05,002
And a great big hand reached out of it

137
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:07,421
and I thought it was God himself
come to take me.

138
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:10,675
But it wasn't.
It was my dear big brother, Henry.

139
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:15,429
- You saved his life. You're a hero.
- Indeed, he is.

140
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:18,349
Well, what was I supposed to do, huh?
Let him drown?

141
00:10:18,432 --> 00:10:21,602
Here's to the future,
whatever it may hold.

142
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:25,356
May you be blessed
with happiness, health, prosperity,

143
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:28,568
and if she'll have you,
a house full of children.

144
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:33,239
My love to you both.

145
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:43,499
Bubbly.

146
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:49,463
Would you mind terribly
if I had a dance with your girl?

147
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:57,346
Miss Chappell, care to take a spin?

148
00:10:58,014 --> 00:10:59,682
I'd be delighted.

149
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:24,040
Jamie saw in a different way.

150
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:31,005
And when his eyes were on me,
I felt like I was no longer invisible.

151
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:15,174
Thanks a lot, guys.

152
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,638
- I'll be back.
- Absolutely.

153
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:33,526
You look especially pretty tonight.

154
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,321
Thank you.

155
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:39,490
Jamie has that effect on girls.

156
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:42,118
They sparkle for him.

157
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:46,873
He likes you. I can tell.

158
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,626
I'm sure he doesn't dislike anyone.

159
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:55,131
Well, at least not anyone in a skirt,
anyways.

160
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:03,765
Henry's marriage proposal
didn't play out like I pictured it would.

161
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:09,728
He wasn't kneeling and the question
came out as more of a statement.

162
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:13,524
Henry wasn't a romantic.

163
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:16,485
He was made of sturdier stuff.

164
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:28,372
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

165
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:29,791
I loved domestic life.

166
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,336
Yielding to Henry
and waiting for him to come home to me

167
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,380
was what I'd been put on Earth to do.

168
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:42,929
And when Amanda Leigh was born,
I became hers completely.

169
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:47,016
Then came the day that changed everything.

170
00:13:47,933 --> 00:13:48,934
Forever.

171
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:56,483
December 7th, 1941,

172
00:13:56,567 --> 00:14:00,696
a date which will live in infamy.

173
00:14:02,031 --> 00:14:04,074
The United States of America...

174
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,661
was suddenly and deliberately attacked...

175
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:13,084
by naval and air forces
of the Empire of Japan.

176
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:18,255
The United States was at peace
with that nation,

177
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,176
and at the solicitation of Japan...

178
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:26,305
Daddy borrowed Mr. Robert
and 'nem truck to take me.

179
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,183
That's what I remember most.

180
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:33,104
The first things and the last things...

181
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,273
they always stick the hardest.

182
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:39,776
Thank you.

183
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:46,492
We'll be praying for you.

184
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:48,702
All right.

185
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:51,737
Don't forget about us.

186
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,542
Oh, I won't.

187
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:59,463
I won't. Okay?

188
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:03,926
You take care.

189
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,136
I will.

190
00:15:08,347 --> 00:15:11,308
Y'all pitch in good around here, yeah?
Help your mother, now.

191
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,979
- All right?
- We will.

192
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:19,566
Keep them no 'count boys off Lilly May.
Don't let her get old so fast.

193
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:28,450
- You just come back.
- I will.

194
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:31,662
You come all the way back. You hear?

195
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,668
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

196
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:57,063
Thank you.

197
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,578
I can't look back.

198
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:15,539
I didn't look back.

199
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,588
They say it's bad luck
to watch somebody leave.

200
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:29,511
I held his heartbeat in my hand.

201
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:32,348
I remember every beat.

202
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,727
He was warm and alive.

203
00:16:38,437 --> 00:16:40,230
I know every place in him...

204
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:47,321
and it was all I could do
to not look back.

205
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:51,283
No, I don't have favorites.

206
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:54,078
I love them all equally.

207
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,080
Every mother does.

208
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,670
But during all those four years...

209
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:07,258
all that time he was gone...

210
00:17:09,468 --> 00:17:11,303
I only prayed for him.

211
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:15,975
God will forgive me.

212
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:31,365
Come on, now.

213
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:35,702
Dig that hole in there.

214
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,981
Come on, Ruel. Let's go. Come on.

215
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:08,235
Keep going.
Supper's gonna be ready when we get in.

216
00:18:09,194 --> 00:18:10,988
What good is a deed?

217
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:18,454
My grandfathers and great uncles,
grandmothers and great aunts,

218
00:18:18,537 --> 00:18:20,289
father and mother,

219
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:25,419
broke, tilled, thawed,
planted, plucked, raised,

220
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:28,714
burned, broke again.

221
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:32,093
Worked this land all their life,

222
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:34,762
this land that never would be theirs.

223
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:40,726
They worked until they sweated.
They sweated until they bled.

224
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:43,229
They bled until they died.

225
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:47,691
Died with the dirt of this same 200 acres
under their fingernails.

226
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:54,990
Died clawing at the hard, brown back
that would never be theirs.

227
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,661
All their deeds undone.

228
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,335
Yet this man, this place, this law...

229
00:19:07,002 --> 00:19:10,714
say you need a deed. Not deeds.

230
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:21,016
Calvin Augustus got his land here...

231
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:24,144
and then Bud Leo bought land here.

232
00:19:25,896 --> 00:19:29,858
Now I figure
there's a couple acres right here.

233
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:32,278
If only fences can be put up with lead.

234
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:35,447
They get taken down with lead
all the time.

235
00:19:36,698 --> 00:19:38,367
Won't be too much longer, Papa, will it?

236
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,535
Around this time next year,

237
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:41,495
I'm gonna have me
about 50 acres of cotton,

238
00:19:41,578 --> 00:19:43,664
50 acres of oats, 50 acres of rice.

239
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:45,291
Fool, rice don't grow here.

240
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:46,875
Never call your brother a fool.

241
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:49,170
I'm gonna grow some anyway.

242
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:52,798
That's why I'm not gonna be no farmer.
I'm gonna be a stenographer.

243
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:55,050
- A Ste... what?
- It's kind of like a typist.

244
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:59,138
- They don't allow no colored typists.
- Your sister will be the first.

245
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:26,331
Honey, by the way...

246
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:29,459
I bought a farm in Mississippi.

247
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:34,047
And we'll be moving there
in three weeks' time.

248
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:41,597
It's 40 miles south of Greenville.

249
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:44,015
Big old...

250
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,811
porch, fig tree...

251
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,856
Girls are gonna love the four bedrooms.

252
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:53,442
But we love this house.

253
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:56,862
But now they get their own room each
and Pappy gets his own space.

254
00:20:56,945 --> 00:20:58,029
Pappy?

255
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:02,075
Honey, now Mama's gone,
we gotta look after him.

256
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:07,497
We got 200 acres of fertile land.
Imagine that.

257
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:14,838
- You're mighty quiet.
- I'm mighty surprised.

258
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:19,009
You always knew
I wanted my own farm someday.

259
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:20,552
- No.
- I told ya.

260
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:22,888
Henry, I had no idea.

261
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:24,640
- I'm...
- I would have remembered that.

262
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:30,687
Well, I'm telling you now.

263
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:33,815
You're gonna love it.

264
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,902
You will. Wait and see.

265
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,864
Hmm?

266
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:56,379
Honey.

267
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,853
Huh?

268
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:55,731
- I like the porch a lot.
- Yeah.

269
00:22:56,231 --> 00:22:57,316
Huh?

270
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:00,151
Yeah? Who's gonna get which room?

271
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:02,028
Come on, come on. Come on. You, too.

272
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:04,406
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You wait up there, huh?

273
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,575
You're gonna get the best room
for yourself, huh?

274
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:08,494
Is that it, huh?

275
00:23:09,035 --> 00:23:10,036
Huh?

276
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:12,539
What's 'round the back
over there?

277
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:16,752
There should be a key right under the mat.

278
00:23:16,835 --> 00:23:19,129
- Go on. Get it. Get it.
- Who the hell are you?

279
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:22,883
We're the McAllans.

280
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,220
New tenants of this house. Who are you?

281
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:30,181
Orris Stokes.
I'm the new owner of this house.

282
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:33,685
Well, I rented this place off
of George Suddeth just three weeks ago.

283
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,687
Suddeth sold me this house last week.

284
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:38,607
He didn't say nothing about no renters.

285
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:43,445
Well, looks like I'm gonna have
to refresh his memory, huh?

286
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:45,864
- He left town three days ago.
- I gave him a $100 deposit.

287
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:48,784
- You get anything in writing?
- No, Pappy, I shook on the deal.

288
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:53,038
I gave him $100, cash,
right there in the front room.

289
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:56,207
Had dinner with him and his wife. I did.
I showed him...

290
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:59,920
- Y'all best be getting on.
- I showed him pictures of my little...

291
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:02,881
You got swindled, boy. Damn fool.

292
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,258
You damn fool.

293
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:09,763
Never thought a son of mine would be
so damn stupid.

294
00:24:16,978 --> 00:24:19,815
Come on, we can stay on the farm.
There's a house there.

295
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:21,058
We're gonna stay on the farm.

296
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:23,819
We can make it work. Come on.

297
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,988
Out there with the niggers
and the farmhands?

298
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:29,700
There's no place in town big enough
for all of us, Pappy.

299
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:32,244
Believe me, I checked.
Huh? Come on, sugar.

300
00:24:43,088 --> 00:24:46,341
Honey! This is it!
This is our land, honey!

301
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:13,368
One of my great uncles, Uncle Willie,

302
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:16,622
got a hold of a piece of land
down Reconstruction.

303
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:18,081
He had a deed.

304
00:25:18,164 --> 00:25:22,335
Four white men on horses rode up one day,
aimed a pistol...

305
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,546
said he was dead.

306
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:27,132
My uncle's good deed,

307
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:30,552
torn into 40 pieces
and thrown to the wind.

308
00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:36,892
And so I ask, what good is a deed?

309
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:48,737
That mule made me a share tenant,
not a sharecropper.

310
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,116
And had me dreaming
about having my own piece of land.

311
00:25:54,535 --> 00:25:56,286
Maybe that's where the problem started.

312
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,079
You'll be coming to us for all your food.

313
00:25:58,163 --> 00:25:59,873
We're gonna be getting
all your stenographer money.

314
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:03,376
Nuh-uh.
'Cause I'mma be in California or Chicago,

315
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,794
where all the good colored jobs at.

316
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:06,421
- War gonna be over by then.
- No, it won't.

317
00:26:10,258 --> 00:26:13,720
- But Ronsel might be home early.
- I don't want him home early.

318
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:16,640
- Early means...
- He ain't coming back early.

319
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:21,019
Y'all finish up.
Get these dishes rinsed off before bed.

320
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:46,669
Howdy.

321
00:26:47,713 --> 00:26:48,922
Evenin', mister.

322
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:50,882
McAllan. Henry... Henry McAllan.

323
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:54,511
- You're Hap Jackson.
- Yes, sir.

324
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:57,847
My family and I, we just arrived.

325
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,475
I'll need your help to unload.

326
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:02,393
- So you're the new owner?
- I am.

327
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:04,237
Thought y'all weren't comin'
until next week.

328
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:09,025
Need to get unloaded,
get a fire on before it gets dark.

329
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:11,111
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

330
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,321
Evenin'.

331
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:20,954
Then tell him to walk.

332
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:24,750
It's too far, and we don't have time.
It's getting late in the day.

333
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,626
I ain't movin' for no nigger.

334
00:27:27,252 --> 00:27:29,295
He can't ride with Laura
and the girls alone so...

335
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:32,883
There's no room in the back of truck.
Pappy, please.

336
00:27:49,858 --> 00:27:51,818
Mr. McAllan was from Memphis,
and my guess was

337
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:54,988
he ain't know the eating end of a mule
from the crappin' end.

338
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:02,578
Told me he intended to bring in
one of them infernal tractors.

339
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:04,790
Imagine that.

340
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:09,920
Using a machine to work his land
instead of the hands the Lord gave 'em.

341
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:12,422
Huh? Gonna do some fishin'.

342
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:14,507
You all right, Mrs. McAllan?

343
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:15,800
Fine. Thank you.

344
00:28:16,342 --> 00:28:19,304
You better get him to fix them shutters
or we're gonna freeze to death.

345
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:22,107
We gotta get that truck unloaded
before that rain comes down.

346
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,643
Just leave it right here.

347
00:28:28,146 --> 00:28:30,732
You relax yourself there, Pappy.
We'll take it.

348
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:33,234
Girls are done in. I need their blankets.

349
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,028
All right.

350
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,906
There has to be some in here somewhere.

351
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:40,200
All right, girls, come on.

352
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,911
- Just stack 'em in the corner.
- Yes, ma'am.

353
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:51,294
"A Tale of Two Cities.

354
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,171
Wuthering..."

355
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:54,254
You can read?

356
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,758
My son Ronsel taught me.

357
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:59,010
He gonna be fightin' under General Patton.

358
00:28:59,094 --> 00:29:01,805
You mean diggin' ditches
and peelin' potatoes?

359
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:03,765
No, sir, he a tank commander.

360
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:07,518
Oh, there's no way the army's gonna
turn a tank worth thousands of dollars

361
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:08,812
over to a nigger.

362
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:11,481
Now my son Jamie,
now there's a fighting man.

363
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:13,859
He's flying bombers.

364
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,279
Uh, my son's a sergeant. 761st Battalion.

365
00:29:18,363 --> 00:29:19,823
Calls 'em the Black Panthers.

366
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:21,407
Hey.

367
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,326
Boy.

368
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,996
You know what they call a nigger
with stripes?

369
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,499
A raccoon.

370
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:33,586
Honey, where you wanna put this piano?

371
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:35,505
Let me get the girls to bed first.

372
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:37,590
Ain't no room for that piano.
Where am I gonna sleep?

373
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:38,925
We'll have to put you in the lean-to.

374
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:40,468
I ain't sleepin' out there.

375
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:42,888
- It don't even have a floor.
- Henry, please.

376
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:44,806
- There's no room.
- Get rid of that piano,

377
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,351
we can put a bed right there.
Put a curtain around it.

378
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:49,644
It's true, we could.

379
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:51,562
I don't want a bedroom
in the living room.

380
00:29:51,646 --> 00:29:52,814
She puttin' me out.

381
00:29:52,898 --> 00:29:55,498
- We're not puttin' you out.
- Henry, may I speak to you in private?

382
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:57,027
- Honey! Not puttin' you out.
- Henry.

383
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,030
When you told me that you were bringin' me
to this godforsaken place,

384
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:01,031
I barely said a word.

385
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:03,491
When you informed me he was comin'
to live with us, I went along.

386
00:30:03,574 --> 00:30:05,201
And when Orris Stokes told you

387
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:07,787
you'd been fleeced by that man you rented
the house from, I kept my mouth shut.

388
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:10,915
But I am tellin' you now,
we are not gettin' rid of that piano.

389
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:13,251
It's the one civilized thing
in this place.

390
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:16,171
So your father can either sleep
in the lean-to or in the bed with you,

391
00:30:16,254 --> 00:30:18,054
because I'm not stayin' here
without my piano.

392
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:19,758
You know what? You're overtired.

393
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:21,092
No, I'm not.

394
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:25,596
God damn it!

395
00:30:32,812 --> 00:30:34,132
My great-great-granddaddy

396
00:30:34,189 --> 00:30:36,816
and his slaves built the farm
that I grew up on.

397
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:40,403
One time, my granddaddy told me to go out,

398
00:30:40,486 --> 00:30:43,364
grab a handful of dirt from the yard
and bring it in.

399
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:47,452
He said, "What are you holdin', son?"
And I said, "Dirt."

400
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,954
"That's right. Now give it to me."

401
00:30:50,705 --> 00:30:53,917
So I did, and he says,
"Now what's this I've got in my hand?"

402
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,336
"Dirt," I says.

403
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,714
"No, boy, this is land that I've gotten.
Do you know why?"

404
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:04,928
Because I own it. Because it's mine.

405
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:07,096
"And one day, it'll be yours."

406
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:10,809
Except that land never became mine.

407
00:31:10,892 --> 00:31:13,186
No, Pappy sold it after the flood.

408
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:16,815
He told people
that the river wiped him out.

409
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:19,567
But that was just a lie.

410
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:23,654
He walked away from that land gladly.

411
00:31:40,046 --> 00:31:42,423
The army made Jamie a bomber pilot.

412
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:45,301
It was my fault that he's up there.

413
00:31:46,302 --> 00:31:49,055
I made him promise
if he ever had to be a soldier,

414
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:50,765
he would get up to the sky.

415
00:31:51,807 --> 00:31:54,227
They say battle is cleaner up there.

416
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,430
It all looks clear.

417
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:01,985
Adam's on the left.

418
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:04,695
He sure is.

419
00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:06,905
All right.

420
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:13,038
Missed my daughter's birthday.
She's not too happy about that.

421
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:16,582
We'll get back soon.
I'll get you back safe, Rog.

422
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,543
All right, I'll hold you to that.

423
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:21,671
You got your pinup girl. I got mine.

424
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:24,215
Yeah, but mine's from a magazine.

425
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:31,222
Dear family...

426
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:37,645
I'm writing you
from a village in Belgium called Tillet.

427
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:43,443
Belgium is a country just north of France,
and it's beautiful.

428
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,739
Daddy would like it around here.
There's lots of farms.

429
00:32:47,822 --> 00:32:49,449
What's this?

430
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:52,076
- "Come out fighting"?
- Yeah, man.

431
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,953
Of course,
by the time you get this,

432
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:55,997
I'll probably be long gone from here.

433
00:32:56,998 --> 00:32:59,209
We always seem to be on the move.

434
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:01,836
- Man all guns!
- On me!

435
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,629
Move out! Let's go!

436
00:33:03,713 --> 00:33:05,798
Come on! Roll out! Roll out!

437
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,055
- These people ready to go?
- Let's move!

438
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,894
Did you shoot your horse?

439
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:21,139
- What kind of man shoots his horse, Carl?
- Someone...

440
00:33:21,189 --> 00:33:23,524
- Can't even get his feeding on time.
- My horse ate my tobacco!

441
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:25,648
- It's my property!
- Carl, I've heard enough, okay?

442
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:26,861
I don't wanna hear no more!

443
00:33:26,945 --> 00:33:29,530
Okay? If you can't do your job,
I can't keep you on!

444
00:33:29,614 --> 00:33:30,991
- Henry, no.
- Now, you know that!

445
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:32,450
Henry. Henry, I got...

446
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:35,245
Please. I got Vera and the girls
and I got one on the way!

447
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:36,829
- I mean...
- Man, I got...

448
00:33:36,912 --> 00:33:38,206
I got a wife. I got kids, Carl.

449
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:41,459
- I don't got anyplace else to go.
- I got a wife. I got kids, okay?

450
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:42,835
I'm runnin' a farm, not a charity.

451
00:33:42,918 --> 00:33:44,879
- You got till the end of the week!
- Please!

452
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:46,839
The end of the week.

453
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:48,383
Then I want you gone!

454
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:29,257
Violence is part and parcel
of country life.

455
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:33,553
You're forever being assailed
by dead things.

456
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:41,561
Dead mice, dead rabbits, dead possums.

457
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:43,729
You find them in the yard.

458
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:46,607
You smell them rottin' under the house.

459
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:49,736
And then there are the creatures
you kill for food.

460
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:56,451
Chickens, hogs, deer, frogs, squirrels.

461
00:34:57,118 --> 00:35:03,333
Pluck, skin, disembowel, debone, fry.

462
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:07,587
Eat, start again, kill.

463
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:13,134
I learned how to stitch up
a bleeding wound...

464
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:15,678
load and fire a shotgun...

465
00:35:16,512 --> 00:35:20,224
reach into the womb of a heavin' sow
to deliver a breeched piglet.

466
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:23,686
My hands did these things...

467
00:35:24,729 --> 00:35:26,606
but I was never easy in my mind.

468
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:33,946
Howdy, Mrs. McAllan.

469
00:35:35,948 --> 00:35:37,617
Hello, Miss...

470
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,245
Vera. You can call me Vera.

471
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,080
Hello, Vera.

472
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:44,082
This here's one of my daughters, Alma.

473
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:48,002
We need to talk to you.

474
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:12,067
You can't put us off.

475
00:36:13,027 --> 00:36:13,944
Excuse me?

476
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:16,322
We ain't got nowhere to go
if you put us out.

477
00:36:16,822 --> 00:36:19,284
Ain't nobody gonna hire us this late
in the season.

478
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:23,663
It's not up to me, Vera.
It's up to my husband.

479
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:26,040
I'm asking you to keep us on.

480
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:28,417
I'm tellin' you it's not my decision.

481
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:32,713
And if it was?

482
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:38,719
Alma.

483
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:01,075
Dear family...

484
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:04,620
The locals treat us real nice.

485
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,333
They ain't like the white folks back home.

486
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:11,836
I get homesick.

487
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:15,965
And they do all they can
to make us feel right at home.

488
00:37:17,717 --> 00:37:19,219
I'm mighty grateful for that.

489
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:21,846
Ronsel.

490
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:36,819
Henry!

491
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:39,822
Henry!

492
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:43,534
- What?
- Henry, your wife wants you.

493
00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:47,121
Isabelle's sick and the other one's
comin' down with it, too.

494
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:49,081
I'm comin'!

495
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,961
It's whooping cough. Go get the doctor.

496
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:56,422
And tell your father
to put water on to boil.

497
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,466
Henry, go!

498
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:00,008
Go!

499
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:24,074
"I wish you were all there to see it."

500
00:38:24,158 --> 00:38:28,913
Her dress was so glitty... glittery.

501
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,001
Even the white GI's couldn't
take their eyes off her.

502
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:36,837
Tell Lilly May

503
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:43,386
even the great Lena Horne hasn't got
half the voice she does.

504
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:49,309
Make sure Ruel stays practicing
his fastball.

505
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:52,312
Tell Marlon.

506
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:59,318
I tried to save him some snow,
but it melted.

507
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:04,907
"So I'll be bringin' him
a glass of water instead."

508
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,534
All right.

509
00:39:08,494 --> 00:39:09,412
"And..."

510
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,044
- Hap!
- Comin', sir!

511
00:39:19,505 --> 00:39:21,757
Hap, I need your wife. I need Florence.

512
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:23,634
My girls are comin' down sick
with a whooping cough,

513
00:39:23,718 --> 00:39:26,637
and I can't get to town on account
of the bridge been washed out.

514
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:28,681
I remember you said she was a midwife.

515
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:31,183
- My wife ain't no doctor, sir.
- I realize that, Hap,

516
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:33,102
but my wife needs some help
and I thought...

517
00:39:33,185 --> 00:39:36,939
- When did they start the whooping?
- Isabelle started a couple of days ago

518
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:39,775
and Amanda Leigh started coughing
a few hours back.

519
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:40,859
They still catching.

520
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:43,904
She can get you some remedies to take,
but she can't go with you, sir.

521
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:45,740
I can pay you.

522
00:39:47,408 --> 00:39:49,702
I won't be able to come home
for about three or four days.

523
00:39:49,785 --> 00:39:51,996
- Who's gonna look after my own family?
- Please.

524
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,873
My wife is afraid.

525
00:40:05,259 --> 00:40:08,178
I didn't have the luxury
of only lovin' my own children.

526
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:13,601
My own mother, I remember being blue.

527
00:40:14,643 --> 00:40:16,354
Blue from the dark of the mornin'.

528
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:19,106
When the moon would still be up,

529
00:40:19,189 --> 00:40:21,567
she kissin' me and my sisters
on the eyelids,

530
00:40:21,651 --> 00:40:23,152
us pretendin' to be asleep.

531
00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:26,155
She goin' off to work...

532
00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:29,909
to wake and kiss some other woman's
children in the sunlight.

533
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:33,704
I swore that my own children would have
all of me.

534
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:37,087
Mind your step.

535
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,626
- This is Florence.
- Who's this?

536
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:39,627
She's a midwife.

537
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,171
- Do you see anybody giving birth here?
- The bridge is washed out.

538
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:43,839
- She might be able to help.
- The girls need a doctor...

539
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:44,799
Damn bridge is flooded.

540
00:40:44,882 --> 00:40:46,442
- What do you want me to do?
- Take her.

541
00:40:52,682 --> 00:40:54,725
I've seen this with my own children.

542
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:56,729
We gotta get liquid down 'em.

543
00:40:56,811 --> 00:40:59,439
But first we gotta clear out
some of this phlegm.

544
00:40:59,522 --> 00:41:01,982
And that's real good
you makin' that steam for 'em.

545
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:04,902
Mr. McAllan, would you kindly boil
some more water, sir.

546
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:06,737
I want Mama!

547
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:09,114
That'll draw the phlegm
right out of them.

548
00:41:09,198 --> 00:41:11,992
I should've taken them to the doctor
as soon as they started coughing.

549
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:13,619
If anything happens...

550
00:41:15,955 --> 00:41:18,416
Now I know
what my mother must've known.

551
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,460
Your girls are gonna be just fine.

552
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:21,752
Okay.

553
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:25,130
That if something had ever
happened to that other woman's children,

554
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:28,133
that would have been the end of us.

555
00:41:29,802 --> 00:41:33,514
Now I know that she left us
not just out of duty...

556
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,016
- but out of love.
- I'm thirsty.

557
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:40,104
Do you hear me, gal? I want some damn...

558
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:42,648
- You put that knife up to me...
- Now I know...

559
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:46,026
- I will slap the piss out of you.
- That love is a kind of survival.

560
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,230
We're taking hits.
What's going on back there?

561
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:51,118
I have visual. I have visual.
Bring it around. Bring it around.

562
00:41:51,198 --> 00:41:52,950
They took out the tail gunner!

563
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,286
Take it down!

564
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:03,210
I need some altitude.

565
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:06,213
Grab a left! Grab a left!
Pull it up!

566
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:07,840
Here we go, Captain!

567
00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:16,515
Roger! Hey, hey! Roger!

568
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,433
We broke formation!

569
00:42:19,143 --> 00:42:20,478
Roger, come on!

570
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,022
Front gunner, are you up there?

571
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:25,357
I'm still with you!
I got him! I got him!

572
00:42:27,693 --> 00:42:30,488
- We got some coming on the left!
- I see 'em!

573
00:42:32,448 --> 00:42:36,494
Cover me! Cover me!

574
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:44,168
Oh, no!

575
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:48,839
No!

576
00:43:14,406 --> 00:43:15,406
Mama?

577
00:43:17,409 --> 00:43:18,619
Mornin'.

578
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:21,539
Glad to see you feelin' better.

579
00:43:25,918 --> 00:43:27,878
Well, we have
some good news for ya.

580
00:43:27,962 --> 00:43:29,672
We'd like to offer you a job.

581
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:31,507
Workin' here for me.

582
00:43:32,382 --> 00:43:33,926
I'll need help with the girls.

583
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:36,053
Cookin', cleanin', that sort of thing.

584
00:43:38,055 --> 00:43:40,558
It means extra money
for you and your family.

585
00:43:44,228 --> 00:43:46,105
We don't belong to them.

586
00:43:47,857 --> 00:43:51,694
We pay rent, work our crops for us.
That's it.

587
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:53,988
They can't just pick us up,
set us down like we tools.

588
00:43:54,655 --> 00:43:56,782
You're the one
always talkin' about saving,

589
00:43:56,866 --> 00:43:59,910
how owning our own parcel the only way
to get out from under their foot.

590
00:43:59,994 --> 00:44:02,955
- We right there.
- I don't want you workin' for them.

591
00:44:03,038 --> 00:44:06,000
I won't be workin' for them.
I'd be workin' for us.

592
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,751
I already said yes.

593
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,634
"For the husband is the head of the wife,
even as Christ is the head of the church."

594
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:18,012
"An excellent wife, who can find?"

595
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:19,930
She's more precious than jewels.

596
00:44:20,014 --> 00:44:24,143
"Her husband trust in her,
and he will have no lack of gain."

597
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:28,397
All those Sundays.

598
00:44:29,815 --> 00:44:32,735
- You really are listenin', huh?
- Yes.

599
00:44:32,818 --> 00:44:35,070
And now you must listen to me.

600
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:45,915
"In my father's house are many mansions."

601
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,169
I know that to be so.
If it wasn't so, I would've told you.

602
00:44:51,796 --> 00:44:53,923
I go to prepare a place for you.

603
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:59,011
"That where I am, ye may be also."

604
00:45:01,346 --> 00:45:03,057
I know that brings me comfort.

605
00:45:04,641 --> 00:45:06,852
It brings me comfort to know that...

606
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,229
one day, my getting up gonna be

607
00:45:09,313 --> 00:45:11,356
just a little bit easier
than it was the day before.

608
00:45:13,192 --> 00:45:14,694
One mornin'...

609
00:45:15,444 --> 00:45:17,654
my children ain't gonna wake up
to this place.

610
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:21,533
They gonna open their eyes up
on a new sky.

611
00:45:22,785 --> 00:45:27,581
One mornin', we're gonna break this boot
from 'round our neck

612
00:45:27,665 --> 00:45:30,000
and shake these chains
from 'rounds our feets.

613
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:32,962
One mornin'.

614
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:36,173
And I ain't talkin' about the hereafter.
I'm talkin' about the right now.

615
00:45:36,256 --> 00:45:37,256
Right now!

616
00:45:37,717 --> 00:45:40,344
- One mornin'!
- One mornin'!

617
00:45:40,427 --> 00:45:41,595
I said...

618
00:46:32,772 --> 00:46:34,064
Fire!

619
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:35,065
Fire!

620
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:38,861
Nice shot, baby! Nice shot!

621
00:46:42,447 --> 00:46:44,825
Out of the tank! Out of the tank!

622
00:46:47,912 --> 00:46:52,374
Out, out, out!
Out of the tank! Out of the tank!

623
00:46:54,168 --> 00:46:55,669
Dad! Dad!

624
00:46:59,298 --> 00:47:00,674
I got you!

625
00:47:01,842 --> 00:47:04,094
Move! Move! Move! Get down!

626
00:47:05,763 --> 00:47:08,390
I need a medic! I need a medic!

627
00:47:52,142 --> 00:47:55,520
Lingered along. Lingered along.

628
00:47:58,315 --> 00:48:01,944
Laid in that bed knowing
my wife out doin' my work for me.

629
00:48:03,988 --> 00:48:06,281
Florence's hands all blistered up.

630
00:48:08,075 --> 00:48:11,453
And I seen her rubbin' her back
when she thought I wasn't lookin'.

631
00:48:34,184 --> 00:48:36,353
The rain came that next day.

632
00:48:37,729 --> 00:48:40,983
A big, hard rain that packed the fields
tight as wax.

633
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:49,825
Nothin' we could do.

634
00:48:51,201 --> 00:48:56,498
Sat there, watchin' and frettin'
for two days till it finally cleared up.

635
00:49:26,653 --> 00:49:28,322
Hap, you in there?

636
00:49:28,405 --> 00:49:29,614
Yes, sir.

637
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:37,372
- How you feelin'?
- Gettin' better by the day, sir.

638
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,375
Well, you look like
you know what you're doing there.

639
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:42,586
Family tradition.

640
00:49:42,669 --> 00:49:45,172
How much longer you reckon
you're gonna be laid up for?

641
00:49:45,965 --> 00:49:49,426
Oh, well, Doc Turpin says six weeks.
It's already been four.

642
00:49:49,509 --> 00:49:51,178
I bet I'll be out there by Monday.

643
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,139
- Monday, you reckon? Well...
- Yes, sir.

644
00:49:54,931 --> 00:49:56,808
I'll come to it. I don't...

645
00:49:56,892 --> 00:50:00,270
I don't think you're gonna get everythin'
in the ground on time.

646
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:03,232
You're cuttin' it close.

647
00:50:05,025 --> 00:50:08,695
Florence and the boys are
out there workin' double time, sir.

648
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:11,823
And you know field needs to be rebroke
'cause of that rain.

649
00:50:11,906 --> 00:50:15,285
Mmm, don't I know it? Yeah,
wish we could control the rain.

650
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:18,914
Y'all ought to be
well into plantin' by now,

651
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:21,041
and you haven't even
gotten your fields laid by.

652
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:26,296
Can't afford to wait any longer, Hap.
You're a farmer. You understand that.

653
00:50:26,963 --> 00:50:28,298
Yes, sir.

654
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,510
Of course, if you had a mule...

655
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,055
you'd be done in no time.

656
00:50:36,598 --> 00:50:39,393
- We lost that mule to lockjaw, sir.
- I know.

657
00:50:40,644 --> 00:50:42,021
Florence and the boys out there...

658
00:50:42,104 --> 00:50:43,944
You're gonna have to rent one
of my mules, Hap.

659
00:50:44,856 --> 00:50:46,942
You'll go on half shares
till you pay it off.

660
00:50:51,405 --> 00:50:54,074
Send one of your boys around after dinner
to fetch that mule.

661
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,951
Yes, sir.

662
00:52:53,568 --> 00:52:55,779
Honey, by the way,
I forgot to tell ya.

663
00:52:55,862 --> 00:52:57,864
Florence ain't gonna be able
to work with us for a while.

664
00:52:57,947 --> 00:53:00,116
What do you mean
Florence isn't comin' back?

665
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,995
Well, not till the end of July, anyways.
Until we get the seed in the ground.

666
00:53:04,078 --> 00:53:07,499
- Where's Hap?
- Hap broke his leg. I told ya.

667
00:53:07,582 --> 00:53:08,708
- No.
- I did.

668
00:53:08,792 --> 00:53:09,959
- You didn't, Henry.
- I did.

669
00:53:10,043 --> 00:53:12,283
I need help with the girls.
Can't you lend them a mule...

670
00:53:12,337 --> 00:53:15,048
No, I can't lend him a mule.

671
00:53:15,131 --> 00:53:16,758
You don't just lend somebody a mule.

672
00:53:17,217 --> 00:53:20,178
Why don't I just give 'em the whole farm
while I'm at it?

673
00:53:22,306 --> 00:53:25,141
I mean, if they can't get the seed
in the ground in time,

674
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:28,228
they need to rent one of ours,
and they can pay us a half share for it.

675
00:53:28,312 --> 00:53:30,564
It's tough on them, but it's good for us.

676
00:53:30,647 --> 00:53:32,023
Hap hurt himself working for us.

677
00:53:32,106 --> 00:53:35,610
No, Laura, Hap Jackson hurt himself
workin' for Hap Jackson.

678
00:53:35,694 --> 00:53:38,029
- Farming's a business.
- I just think...

679
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:41,616
You just think. Well, I just sank
everything we have into this farm.

680
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,700
Everything.

681
00:53:43,285 --> 00:53:47,038
We need to make some money this year,
or our family's in trouble.

682
00:53:48,206 --> 00:53:49,624
Now, do you understand that?

683
00:53:53,378 --> 00:53:54,378
Do you?

684
00:53:55,088 --> 00:53:56,172
Yes, Henry.

685
00:53:57,882 --> 00:54:00,302
All right, then. Hmm? Come on.

686
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:07,684
8-30-62.

687
00:54:10,729 --> 00:54:14,858
The date the Confederate forces crushed
the Union army in the Battle of Richmond.

688
00:54:16,192 --> 00:54:19,112
I don't think he knew
that I knew the combination.

689
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:28,413
- Hello. Mrs. Jackson?
- Yes?

690
00:54:28,496 --> 00:54:32,792
I'm Dr. Pearlman.
I'm here to treat your husband.

691
00:54:33,377 --> 00:54:37,088
Oh, thank you. Come in.

692
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,473
If you'd asked me before then,

693
00:54:46,556 --> 00:54:48,934
I'd have told you
all white folks was the same.

694
00:55:05,158 --> 00:55:07,118
Henry stayed mad at me...

695
00:55:08,036 --> 00:55:10,413
and he showed it by ignoring me
in our bed.

696
00:55:13,082 --> 00:55:16,085
I hadn't always enjoyed
Henry's lovemaking,

697
00:55:16,169 --> 00:55:18,087
but it made me feel like a true wife.

698
00:55:35,897 --> 00:55:37,899
I never thought of refusin' him.

699
00:55:39,818 --> 00:55:41,445
How could he refuse me?

700
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:51,705
This is a solemn but glorious hour.

701
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:54,749
General Eisenhower informs me...

702
00:55:55,249 --> 00:56:00,339
that the forces of Germany
have surrendered to the United Nations.

703
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:04,801
The flags of freedom fly all over Europe.

704
00:56:06,219 --> 00:56:10,181
For this victory,
we join in offering our thanks

705
00:56:10,264 --> 00:56:14,185
to the providence
which has guided and sustained us...

706
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:39,461
- Hitler is dead!
- War is over!

707
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:43,548
Hitler's dead!

708
00:57:06,237 --> 00:57:07,906
This is over, yes?

709
00:57:19,543 --> 00:57:20,919
War is over!

710
00:57:22,754 --> 00:57:24,338
Boom!

711
00:57:24,423 --> 00:57:26,841
We're in enemy territory.
We're in enemy territory.

712
00:57:26,925 --> 00:57:29,428
You dead, cracker, you dead!

713
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,848
We're runnin' over 'em.
Watch your right, gunner.

714
00:57:48,071 --> 00:57:49,072
Bang!

715
00:57:50,114 --> 00:57:51,114
You dead.

716
00:57:59,082 --> 00:58:01,668
Saturday was my favorite day of the week.

717
00:58:03,628 --> 00:58:06,465
It was the only day I felt truly clean.

718
00:58:06,548 --> 00:58:08,800
- Am I sitting down?
- Yes. Sit down.

719
00:58:09,884 --> 00:58:13,430
The rest of the time, we stank.

720
00:59:03,897 --> 00:59:05,899
Mama, somebody's coming!

721
00:59:05,982 --> 00:59:09,443
- Uncle Jamie!
- Uncle Jamie!

722
00:59:09,527 --> 00:59:11,863
Now come give
your Uncle Jamie a hug.

723
00:59:12,572 --> 00:59:13,615
Who's that?

724
00:59:13,698 --> 00:59:15,617
Is that my little Amanda doll?

725
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,161
- And who is this? My little Bella.
- Jamie!

726
00:59:18,244 --> 00:59:20,705
- Oh! Give your Uncle Jamie a hug!
- Jamie! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

727
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:23,625
- You have grown so big!
- Whoo-hoo! Jamie!

728
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:26,460
- Now, who's that?
- Oh!

729
00:59:26,545 --> 00:59:27,754
Come on, girls.

730
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:31,758
You look good, brother.

731
00:59:32,217 --> 00:59:33,593
You look like hell.

732
00:59:34,218 --> 00:59:36,499
- Don't sugarcoat it now.
- "Don't sugarcoat it." Come on!

733
00:59:37,263 --> 00:59:38,347
Huh?

734
00:59:38,431 --> 00:59:39,891
You see him in his uniform?

735
00:59:39,974 --> 00:59:41,768
Oh, my sweet sister-in-law.

736
00:59:42,602 --> 00:59:44,979
- Welcome home, Jamie.
- Come here.

737
00:59:47,649 --> 00:59:50,652
- All right.
- You gonna see what he's got? Huh?

738
00:59:52,946 --> 00:59:55,532
How you enjoyin' it here
in Henry's version of paradise?

739
00:59:56,533 --> 01:00:00,119
You'd think a son would see fit
to say hello to his own father.

740
01:00:00,203 --> 01:00:03,540
Oh, dearest Pappy.
God, how much I missed you.

741
01:00:03,623 --> 01:00:06,250
He's missed you, too,
though he won't admit it.

742
01:00:08,044 --> 01:00:13,341
Yeah. Well, I bet he's quit chewing chaw
and joined the NAACP, too.

743
01:00:17,554 --> 01:00:19,513
Come on,
I can't believe you walked out here!

744
01:00:19,598 --> 01:00:20,682
Well...

745
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:23,602
I didn't wanna bother you guys.

746
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:24,978
It's, uh...

747
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:35,113
That's the last thing that she said.

748
01:00:37,949 --> 01:00:39,158
Boy!

749
01:00:39,242 --> 01:00:41,285
Oh, Lord!

750
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:42,829
Oh, boy.

751
01:00:42,912 --> 01:00:46,040
So, what's it like being a big war hero?

752
01:00:46,124 --> 01:00:49,502
- Shit, I wouldn't know.
- No, don't give me that.

753
01:00:49,586 --> 01:00:51,838
Army wrote me letters
about your fancy medals.

754
01:00:51,921 --> 01:00:55,383
Said it was the highest honor
an airman could achieve.

755
01:00:57,135 --> 01:00:58,720
- They did?
- Well...

756
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:01,139
I was lucky.

757
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:04,768
- Other men weren't.
- Yeah. Well...

758
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:07,771
I bet you got plenty of tail
out if it, too.

759
01:01:07,854 --> 01:01:10,690
Oh, Jamie never needed medals
to get girls, Pappy.

760
01:01:10,774 --> 01:01:11,858
Mmm?

761
01:01:11,941 --> 01:01:14,110
- Take after me that way.
- Hmm.

762
01:01:14,193 --> 01:01:17,446
Your mama was the prettiest girl
in Greenville.

763
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:20,825
And I had 'em all sniffing up after me.

764
01:01:23,202 --> 01:01:25,872
Yeah. I'll tell you one thing for sure.

765
01:01:27,206 --> 01:01:32,128
You had to kill a whole lot of Krauts
to get them medals.

766
01:01:32,211 --> 01:01:35,632
How many did you take out, you reckon?
Fifty? Fifty? A hundred?

767
01:01:35,715 --> 01:01:38,342
- Oh, I don't know.
- Well, take a guess.

768
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:41,262
I don't know.

769
01:01:41,846 --> 01:01:43,807
What... What's the matter?

770
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:46,600
Man ought to know
how many men he's killed.

771
01:01:51,522 --> 01:01:52,522
Well...

772
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,860
I'll tell you one thing.

773
01:02:01,991 --> 01:02:03,910
It was more than one.

774
01:02:12,585 --> 01:02:13,795
Well, son...

775
01:02:15,588 --> 01:02:20,009
at least I looked my one in the eye
before I shot him.

776
01:02:22,636 --> 01:02:25,932
Not like dropping bombs
from a mile up in the air.

777
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:31,688
Pappy.

778
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,607
- Pappy, come on.
- To hell with him.

779
01:02:35,692 --> 01:02:38,361
Why'd you have to go and do that?
Hmm?

780
01:02:40,113 --> 01:02:41,530
He's just proud of you.

781
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,658
- That's all.
- Mmm.

782
01:02:46,786 --> 01:02:48,913
- Yeah.
- Got a point, though.

783
01:02:48,997 --> 01:02:50,498
We should hit the hay.

784
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:52,917
You'll be okay on the couch?

785
01:02:54,085 --> 01:02:55,169
Yeah.

786
01:02:58,589 --> 01:02:59,673
Come on.

787
01:03:05,346 --> 01:03:07,306
Good to see you, little brother.

788
01:03:08,725 --> 01:03:10,977
Appreciate you and Laura for having me.

789
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:13,104
Okay.

790
01:03:14,438 --> 01:03:15,689
You need a good night's sleep.

791
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,737
Feed you up. Get some meat on those bones.

792
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:22,238
Actually, it was more like four.

793
01:03:23,948 --> 01:03:25,074
Four what?

794
01:03:26,617 --> 01:03:30,579
Miles up in the air.
The altitude we dropped those bombs from.

795
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:33,583
The hell you even see anything
that high up?

796
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:36,085
You'd be surprised.

797
01:03:36,836 --> 01:03:38,838
Roads, cities, factories.

798
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:41,800
Just not people.

799
01:03:44,552 --> 01:03:47,096
20,000 feet, they ain't even ants.

800
01:03:51,768 --> 01:03:53,186
Pappy's right.

801
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:56,898
Man ought to know.

802
01:04:02,611 --> 01:04:03,822
Good night.

803
01:04:27,804 --> 01:04:30,639
Home again, home again. Jiggity-jig.

804
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:39,899
Tupelo! Next stop, Tupelo!

805
01:04:45,613 --> 01:04:49,450
Coon, spade, darky, nigger.

806
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,286
Went off to fight for my country

807
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,705
to come back
and find it hadn't changed a bit.

808
01:05:08,011 --> 01:05:09,428
Thank you.

809
01:05:17,186 --> 01:05:18,562
Howdy, Miss Tricklebank.

810
01:05:18,646 --> 01:05:21,482
Ronsel... is that you?

811
01:05:21,565 --> 01:05:23,317
Yes, ma'am, it is, last time I checked.

812
01:05:23,401 --> 01:05:25,987
Oh, I declare, aren't you grown up!
How are ya?

813
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:28,364
I am mighty fine. How've you been?

814
01:05:28,447 --> 01:05:31,159
Oh, I'm getting' along fine.
I'm getting along fine.

815
01:05:31,242 --> 01:05:32,285
You seen your folks yet?

816
01:05:32,368 --> 01:05:36,455
No, I just wanted to stop by and get 'em
a couple of things before I went home.

817
01:05:37,123 --> 01:05:41,127
Hello, Ronsel. I'm Mrs. McAllan.
Your parents work on our farm.

818
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:42,211
How you do, ma'am?

819
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:44,422
Your mother talks about you
all the time.

820
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:46,465
I know they'll be mighty glad to see you.

821
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:48,176
Is that everything?

822
01:05:48,259 --> 01:05:55,141
Oh, no. Uh, I just needed to get
some sugar and some candy.

823
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:56,642
Sugar and candy?

824
01:05:56,725 --> 01:06:00,646
Yes. The sugar's for my mama,
and the candy's for Marlon and Lilly May.

825
01:06:00,729 --> 01:06:02,690
Figured I'd spoil 'em a little bit.

826
01:06:02,773 --> 01:06:05,776
- Sergeant's pay.
- I'm sure they'll appreciate that.

827
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:06,945
Yes, ma'am.

828
01:06:08,946 --> 01:06:11,115
You have a great day. Mrs. McAllan.

829
01:06:14,243 --> 01:06:17,705
Look what we got here. A jig in a uniform.

830
01:06:20,374 --> 01:06:22,126
Where do you think you're goin', boy?

831
01:06:22,919 --> 01:06:25,713
I beg your pardon, sir. I'm just tryin'
to get home to see my folks.

832
01:06:25,796 --> 01:06:28,077
- Not that way you ain't.
- Pappy, this is Ronsel.

833
01:06:28,591 --> 01:06:30,843
Hap and Florence's son.
Just returned from overseas.

834
01:06:30,927 --> 01:06:32,345
Oh, oh!

835
01:06:32,428 --> 01:06:36,182
Well, that explains why you're tryin'
to leave by the front door.

836
01:06:36,265 --> 01:06:39,268
You must be confused
as to your whereabouts.

837
01:06:39,352 --> 01:06:43,106
- No, sir, I'm not confused at all.
- Oh, I think you are, boy.

838
01:06:43,689 --> 01:06:46,109
I don't know
what they let you do over there,

839
01:06:46,192 --> 01:06:48,778
but you're in Mississippi now, nigger.

840
01:06:49,445 --> 01:06:51,197
You use the back door.

841
01:06:54,408 --> 01:06:58,162
Go on, son.
Son, we don't want no trouble here. Go on.

842
01:06:58,746 --> 01:06:59,956
Go on.

843
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,001
You know what? You're absolutely right.

844
01:07:03,084 --> 01:07:07,005
When we was overseas,
they didn't make us use the back door.

845
01:07:07,088 --> 01:07:09,882
General Patton put us on the front line.

846
01:07:10,508 --> 01:07:13,052
Yes, sir. You know what we did?

847
01:07:14,595 --> 01:07:17,515
We kicked the hell out of Hitler
and them Jerries.

848
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:22,020
While y'all at home safe and sound.

849
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,527
Henry, I'm almost done here.

850
01:07:34,573 --> 01:07:36,575
Home again, home again.

851
01:07:40,371 --> 01:07:43,541
Bless us, O Lord, and these
thy gifts which we are about to receive

852
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:46,252
from thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord and savior.

853
01:07:46,335 --> 01:07:49,380
And, Lord,
thank you for the sun you've been sending

854
01:07:49,463 --> 01:07:52,508
to make the cotton grow,
and for the health of all here present.

855
01:07:53,217 --> 01:07:57,513
And, Lord Jesus,
please watch over my boy Ronsel,

856
01:07:57,596 --> 01:07:59,973
wherever in creation he may be.

857
01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:02,393
Amen.

858
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:05,270
Ronsel!

859
01:08:07,023 --> 01:08:09,317
Hey, hey, hey.

860
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,819
Oh, my baby!

861
01:08:15,031 --> 01:08:17,075
Oh, look at you. You're so grown.

862
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:19,910
- Handsome, too.
- Lilly May! Hey.

863
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,081
Oh, Marlon, look at you.
You about my size. You shot up, huh?

864
01:08:24,915 --> 01:08:26,750
- What'd you get them medals for?
- How was the trip home?

865
01:08:26,834 --> 01:08:27,994
For killing Germans?

866
01:08:28,044 --> 01:08:31,044
- Why you ain't tell us you was coming?
- Quit fussing over him now...

867
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,757
and let him come say hello to his father.

868
01:08:54,987 --> 01:08:57,865
I knew you'd come. I prayed for it.

869
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,245
Thank you, God. Look at you.

870
01:09:03,287 --> 01:09:04,288
Look at you.

871
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:18,969
What in the devil happened to you?

872
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:23,807
Mom, I brought you some groceries.

873
01:09:23,891 --> 01:09:25,143
Oh, thank you, baby.

874
01:09:28,854 --> 01:09:30,063
Come on, sit down.

875
01:09:30,898 --> 01:09:33,859
Providence.

876
01:09:33,942 --> 01:09:35,778
- Want some rice?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

877
01:09:35,861 --> 01:09:37,863
- Thank you, God.
- Amen.

878
01:09:50,584 --> 01:09:52,670
I ain't never known you
to smoke, son.

879
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:57,591
Well, a lot's changed, Pop.

880
01:10:00,386 --> 01:10:02,066
You sure you get enough to eat?

881
01:10:02,513 --> 01:10:03,514
Yes.

882
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,019
I'm stuffed. I used to be dreamin'
about them biscuits, too.

883
01:10:09,102 --> 01:10:10,979
Yeah, I dreamt about you, too.

884
01:10:14,942 --> 01:10:16,026
What'd you see?

885
01:10:18,571 --> 01:10:21,323
You back with us now, safe and sound.

886
01:10:22,074 --> 01:10:23,909
Be nice to have
another pair of hands.

887
01:10:24,493 --> 01:10:27,705
With you home, we might can make up
what we lost after my accident.

888
01:10:27,788 --> 01:10:31,417
Pay off the lien, get a new contract,
go back to being tenants next year.

889
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,045
Maybe he got plans of his own.
Let him follow his own mind, Hap.

890
01:10:35,128 --> 01:10:36,297
No, no, Mama.

891
01:10:38,257 --> 01:10:40,343
Yes, of course, I'll stay.

892
01:10:41,385 --> 01:10:42,470
Of course.

893
01:10:44,388 --> 01:10:48,434
Give me time to figure things out
and put this war behind me.

894
01:10:57,485 --> 01:10:59,152
What's he want now?

895
01:11:07,536 --> 01:11:08,996
Evening, Mr. McAllan.

896
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:11,915
Evening, Hap. Florence.

897
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:15,878
This our son Ronsel I told you about.

898
01:11:15,961 --> 01:11:17,338
Yeah, we already met.

899
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:21,884
- Hap, I'd better speak to you alone.
- Huh.

900
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:25,012
I'm not a child, sir.

901
01:11:26,013 --> 01:11:28,807
Anything you can say to my daddy,
you can say in front of me.

902
01:11:31,352 --> 01:11:35,189
All right, then. You're asking for
a whole heap of trouble...

903
01:11:35,773 --> 01:11:38,609
acting the way you did
at Tricklebank's earlier.

904
01:11:39,985 --> 01:11:42,112
Now, I know
you don't want that kinda trouble.

905
01:11:42,863 --> 01:11:46,074
Not for yourself, or for your family.

906
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:47,785
Boy, what'd you do?

907
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:50,246
He couldn't have done anything.

908
01:11:50,329 --> 01:11:53,957
- I just tried to walk out the door is all.
- The front door.

909
01:11:56,585 --> 01:11:59,046
When my father and another man
corrected him, he gave a fine speech.

910
01:11:59,129 --> 01:12:01,173
Put us all in our places, didn't you?

911
01:12:04,217 --> 01:12:05,469
Is that true?

912
01:12:09,682 --> 01:12:11,809
Then I reckon you best apologize.

913
01:12:14,978 --> 01:12:16,439
I'm sorry, sir.

914
01:12:27,741 --> 01:12:28,741
All right.

915
01:12:30,744 --> 01:12:32,413
My father's gonna want an apology, too.

916
01:12:32,496 --> 01:12:34,832
Ronsel will pay him a visit
after church tomorrow, sir.

917
01:12:35,374 --> 01:12:36,583
Won't you, son?

918
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:38,336
Yes, sir.

919
01:12:42,465 --> 01:12:44,633
- Welcome home.
- Thank you, sir.

920
01:12:44,717 --> 01:12:46,051
You have a good night.

921
01:12:52,391 --> 01:12:56,186
No point in fightin'.
They just gonna win every time.

922
01:13:01,149 --> 01:13:04,528
Just not used to walking away
from a fight, Daddy, that's all.

923
01:13:06,364 --> 01:13:07,740
Not no more.

924
01:13:14,872 --> 01:13:16,624
How long you been back?

925
01:13:16,707 --> 01:13:18,417
Oh, just couple of weeks.

926
01:13:18,501 --> 01:13:20,503
Mm-hmm. And how are you liking Marietta?

927
01:13:20,586 --> 01:13:22,963
Oh, it's a lovely little town.
Just lovely.

928
01:13:23,881 --> 01:13:27,009
Oh, I got that one right there.
Put that there.

929
01:13:27,092 --> 01:13:29,762
Much obliged, Miss Tricklebank.
You have yourself a wonderful day.

930
01:13:29,845 --> 01:13:30,846
- Take care.
- Yeah.

931
01:13:35,393 --> 01:13:36,393
Look at that.

932
01:13:36,435 --> 01:13:38,270
- What's that about?
- What's wrong with him?

933
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:43,692
He must've just come back from the war.

934
01:13:52,743 --> 01:13:53,743
It's all right.

935
01:13:54,495 --> 01:13:57,873
It's just a car. It must've backfired.
Stuck intake valve.

936
01:14:13,055 --> 01:14:14,807
They say it stops eventually.

937
01:14:20,396 --> 01:14:22,690
You're Ronsel. Hap's son.

938
01:14:24,525 --> 01:14:26,193
Jamie McAllan. Henry's Brother.

939
01:14:27,069 --> 01:14:28,404
Pleasure to meet you.

940
01:14:33,158 --> 01:14:34,158
You walk here?

941
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:35,911
Yes.

942
01:14:36,328 --> 01:14:37,621
Let me give you a lift.

943
01:14:39,873 --> 01:14:40,999
Come on.

944
01:15:12,865 --> 01:15:14,865
This is Bob Dunning
with the highlights

945
01:15:14,908 --> 01:15:16,785
for the 15th Annual All-Star Game.

946
01:15:17,828 --> 01:15:20,998
- Come on up front!
- I'm fine right where I am.

947
01:15:21,749 --> 01:15:23,709
Get in, soldier. That's an order.

948
01:15:23,792 --> 01:15:25,711
In the National League, heavy artillery.

949
01:15:25,794 --> 01:15:29,089
John Mize, Walker Cooper,
Ralph Kiner and Stan Musial.

950
01:15:30,298 --> 01:15:32,843
The American League pioneers,

951
01:15:32,926 --> 01:15:35,971
Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio,
George Kell and Lou Boudreau.

952
01:15:40,058 --> 01:15:43,020
- How'd you know you outrank me?
- I was a captain.

953
01:15:44,354 --> 01:15:47,024
They got Negro captains.
I served under plenty of 'em.

954
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:53,405
Well, you obeyed my order.
I bet you was a sergeant.

955
01:15:54,364 --> 01:15:56,408
761st Tank Battalion.

956
01:15:57,701 --> 01:15:58,952
"Come Out Fighting."

957
01:16:01,371 --> 01:16:03,415
We spearheaded for General Patton.

958
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:06,084
You?

959
01:16:07,377 --> 01:16:09,087
I flew B-25s.

960
01:16:10,255 --> 01:16:12,925
So, Sergeant, how do you like
being back here in the delta?

961
01:16:19,973 --> 01:16:21,517
Yeah, me, too.

962
01:16:22,475 --> 01:16:25,145
- Heard you and my pappy had some words.
- I apologized for that.

963
01:16:25,229 --> 01:16:28,273
He's a disagreeable son of a bitch.
I'm sure he had it coming.

964
01:16:30,901 --> 01:16:33,987
- Here's to you.
- I'm fine, thank you.

965
01:16:34,822 --> 01:16:36,114
Boy, you always this stubborn,

966
01:16:36,198 --> 01:16:38,701
or just around white people
tryin' to be nice?

967
01:16:42,746 --> 01:16:43,831
Go on.

968
01:16:51,296 --> 01:16:53,757
Now, what kind of NCO are you?

969
01:16:59,721 --> 01:17:03,183
Now, don't waste it, now.
That's my medicine.

970
01:17:03,642 --> 01:17:04,643
I need every drop.

971
01:17:10,065 --> 01:17:12,610
You tanker boys ever piss in your helmets?

972
01:17:14,903 --> 01:17:18,240
- Plenty of times.
- We had a relief tube up in the cockpit.

973
01:17:19,032 --> 01:17:22,077
Sometimes it was easier just to go
in our flak helmets.

974
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,246
But at 20,000 feet,

975
01:17:24,329 --> 01:17:26,832
that piss freezes solid
in less than a minute.

976
01:17:29,001 --> 01:17:30,711
It's that cold up there?

977
01:17:31,378 --> 01:17:34,757
Shit. I'm talking 20, 30 below.

978
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,592
One time we were on this long haul,

979
01:17:36,675 --> 01:17:39,261
I pissed in my helmet,
I forgot all about it.

980
01:17:39,344 --> 01:17:42,723
We were just over the target.
I put the helmet back on.

981
01:17:42,806 --> 01:17:45,058
We're doing this bombing run,
dodgin' enemy flak,

982
01:17:45,142 --> 01:17:49,146
and all of a sudden, I started feelin'
something runnin' down my face.

983
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:51,273
Yeah, I thought I was hit.

984
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,610
I smelled like a damn latrine.

985
01:17:56,612 --> 01:17:59,740
Yeah, you must've caught hell
back at that officer's club, too.

986
01:17:59,823 --> 01:18:02,034
Boy, my friends never let me hear
the end of it.

987
01:18:02,993 --> 01:18:05,120
The ones that made it back, anyway.

988
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:10,458
Yeah, I lost some friends, too.

989
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:14,504
Well, here's to them.

990
01:18:25,766 --> 01:18:29,602
"I wouldn't get home until..."

991
01:18:42,365 --> 01:18:45,869
- Everythin' all right, Mr. Jamie?
- Oh, everything's just fine.

992
01:18:45,953 --> 01:18:48,706
Just gave Ronsel here a little lift
from town.

993
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:53,919
I'll be heading back to town
next Saturday afternoon.

994
01:18:54,002 --> 01:18:56,546
If you like, I'll stop by here
and see if you want a ride.

995
01:18:57,673 --> 01:18:58,924
That'd be fine.

996
01:19:00,133 --> 01:19:01,133
Well, all right.

997
01:19:02,052 --> 01:19:03,136
Hap.

998
01:19:42,342 --> 01:19:45,303
Oh!

999
01:19:46,722 --> 01:19:48,598
Oh, Lord.

1000
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:02,070
I got you somethin', Mom.

1001
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:04,531
Oh.

1002
01:20:06,449 --> 01:20:07,993
This is so much.

1003
01:20:09,036 --> 01:20:11,204
I'll save it for your brother and sister.
They'll love it.

1004
01:20:11,288 --> 01:20:12,288
No.

1005
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:15,500
- I got it for you.
- Oh, baby, I can't.

1006
01:20:16,877 --> 01:20:18,461
I'm gonna watch you eat it.

1007
01:20:27,512 --> 01:20:28,513
Hmm.

1008
01:20:31,558 --> 01:20:32,893
Mm-hmm.

1009
01:20:36,188 --> 01:20:37,397
Thank you, son.

1010
01:20:39,732 --> 01:20:42,778
Finish it, Mom. Don't save it.
Don't save it, Mom.

1011
01:20:44,612 --> 01:20:47,407
I better not see Lilly May or Marlon
with none of that.

1012
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:48,741
All right.

1013
01:20:52,162 --> 01:20:53,580
I love you.

1014
01:20:53,663 --> 01:20:55,165
I love you, too, sweetie.

1015
01:20:58,877 --> 01:20:59,920
Thank you.

1016
01:21:00,963 --> 01:21:02,172
I can't...

1017
01:21:06,718 --> 01:21:07,718
I tried.

1018
01:21:09,805 --> 01:21:13,600
I'm sorry.

1019
01:21:17,062 --> 01:21:18,355
I can't...

1020
01:21:19,982 --> 01:21:21,441
I can't swim.

1021
01:21:23,735 --> 01:21:24,945
Oh, God.

1022
01:21:27,364 --> 01:21:28,866
Oh, God.

1023
01:21:30,408 --> 01:21:31,869
Oh, my God.

1024
01:21:33,578 --> 01:21:37,332
Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Jamie.
It's okay. It's okay.

1025
01:21:37,415 --> 01:21:42,546
It's me. It's me. It's okay. It's okay.

1026
01:21:46,758 --> 01:21:48,760
It's okay. Come here, come here.

1027
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,101
No.

1028
01:21:57,519 --> 01:21:59,563
No, I can't.

1029
01:22:00,313 --> 01:22:01,606
- Jamie.
- I gotta go.

1030
01:22:17,873 --> 01:22:20,750
As usual,
when anything bad happened,

1031
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:22,294
Henry was away.

1032
01:22:23,962 --> 01:22:28,049
He and Pappy had gone to see about
some hogs, so I was alone with the girls.

1033
01:22:40,061 --> 01:22:41,061
Vera?

1034
01:22:43,315 --> 01:22:45,025
You need to take me to town.

1035
01:22:46,443 --> 01:22:48,361
I'm gonna kill Carl.

1036
01:22:51,448 --> 01:22:53,825
Vera, why don't you come
and sit down and we'll talk...

1037
01:22:53,909 --> 01:22:56,119
I don't have time to sit down.

1038
01:22:56,912 --> 01:22:58,746
He's with her now.

1039
01:22:59,205 --> 01:23:01,875
Started in on Alma, just like with Renie.

1040
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:04,836
Amanda Leigh,
take your sister into the house.

1041
01:23:05,795 --> 01:23:09,091
Amanda, go on. Go on 'round the back, go.

1042
01:23:12,177 --> 01:23:15,472
- Vera?
- You gotta take me to town now.

1043
01:23:18,683 --> 01:23:20,393
- I can't drive.
- I seen you drivin'...

1044
01:23:20,477 --> 01:23:23,647
And I got in trouble for it.
My husband took the keys away.

1045
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:28,360
Come on.

1046
01:23:50,298 --> 01:23:54,261
They found Carl's body
laying in the road halfway to town.

1047
01:23:56,388 --> 01:24:00,016
Florence said she'd seen her walking
down Main Street covered in blood.

1048
01:24:02,185 --> 01:24:04,854
She said it looked like
she'd bathed in it.

1049
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:09,901
Vera had stabbed him 17 times.

1050
01:24:11,194 --> 01:24:13,946
But I didn't find out those details
till later.

1051
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:18,410
I was too lost in my own misery.

1052
01:24:30,963 --> 01:24:32,715
What's wrong, Mama?

1053
01:24:32,799 --> 01:24:35,552
Amanda Leigh, I need you to be a big girl
and go and get Florence.

1054
01:24:36,094 --> 01:24:39,264
You remember how to get there?
Good girl, run as fast as you can.

1055
01:24:43,185 --> 01:24:45,062
No!

1056
01:24:46,604 --> 01:24:48,065
No!

1057
01:25:29,856 --> 01:25:31,983
I lost one of my babies once, too.

1058
01:25:36,571 --> 01:25:38,198
His name was Samuel.

1059
01:26:13,024 --> 01:26:15,151
I used to come here all the time
when I was a boy.

1060
01:26:16,778 --> 01:26:20,615
Just when I needed to be alone
and clear my mind.

1061
01:26:21,407 --> 01:26:23,284
Well, I like what you've done
with the place.

1062
01:26:30,583 --> 01:26:31,793
Here.

1063
01:26:35,922 --> 01:26:37,632
Why are you being so nice to me?

1064
01:26:38,258 --> 01:26:40,593
You look like you could use it.

1065
01:26:52,897 --> 01:26:54,316
Bullshit.

1066
01:27:06,453 --> 01:27:08,663
We were somewhere over Austria.

1067
01:27:09,789 --> 01:27:12,917
We made contact
with a whole swarm of Messerschmitts.

1068
01:27:14,336 --> 01:27:16,754
I mean, they was everywhere.

1069
01:27:19,174 --> 01:27:21,884
Took out my tail gun, co-pilot...

1070
01:27:23,928 --> 01:27:26,389
Made a deal with God right there.

1071
01:27:26,473 --> 01:27:29,226
Swore if he saved me,
I was gonna do somethin' good.

1072
01:27:32,729 --> 01:27:34,981
I don't know what that was, but...

1073
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:38,276
I promised anyway.

1074
01:27:42,739 --> 01:27:46,451
Before you know,
whole bunch of P-51s show up...

1075
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:49,412
just like goddamn cavalry.

1076
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:53,416
They cleared those Germans
right out of the sky.

1077
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:59,088
And I swear, they were angels sent
by the Lord himself.

1078
01:28:01,841 --> 01:28:06,137
Those P-51s, their tails was painted red.

1079
01:28:07,305 --> 01:28:09,599
One of 'em buzzed me
right after the flight.

1080
01:28:10,516 --> 01:28:12,894
I looked over.
I thought I was seeing things.

1081
01:28:13,978 --> 01:28:15,647
That fighter pilot...

1082
01:28:18,191 --> 01:28:19,442
he was colored.

1083
01:28:23,905 --> 01:28:25,490
He saluted me...

1084
01:28:28,535 --> 01:28:30,202
I saluted him back.

1085
01:28:35,207 --> 01:28:39,546
Men that died that day...
they were husbands, fathers.

1086
01:28:40,672 --> 01:28:42,006
They were good men.

1087
01:28:43,967 --> 01:28:45,385
A lot better than me.

1088
01:29:12,329 --> 01:29:13,705
Oh, well.

1089
01:29:56,205 --> 01:29:58,916
We brought this for you, Mama.

1090
01:30:00,209 --> 01:30:03,588
This is for you, Mama.

1091
01:30:04,547 --> 01:30:06,299
Now, you gotta...

1092
01:30:07,467 --> 01:30:11,804
You can't have a shower
without the screen up.

1093
01:30:12,472 --> 01:30:14,932
Now, where do we put that?

1094
01:30:15,517 --> 01:30:18,395
What are you thinkin'?
Maybe here, in the water?

1095
01:30:19,061 --> 01:30:23,357
Now you gotta help me figure out
where to put this.

1096
01:30:23,441 --> 01:30:26,611
What do you think? In there?
You can smell it.

1097
01:30:26,694 --> 01:30:30,031
Mommy,
Uncle Jamie's building you a shower.

1098
01:30:30,114 --> 01:30:31,658
You little angel.

1099
01:30:31,741 --> 01:30:33,993
You were supposed to tell me
if she was gonna be comin'.

1100
01:30:38,831 --> 01:30:40,792
Thought you might want a little privacy...

1101
01:30:41,668 --> 01:30:44,253
every now and then,
if you were havin' a bath.

1102
01:30:45,797 --> 01:30:47,339
What you think?

1103
01:30:51,302 --> 01:30:52,887
I think it's marvelous.

1104
01:30:54,221 --> 01:30:55,221
Thank you.

1105
01:30:55,264 --> 01:30:56,264
Well...

1106
01:31:00,687 --> 01:31:02,021
I'll fetch some water.

1107
01:31:05,316 --> 01:31:06,734
They smell good, baby.

1108
01:31:53,615 --> 01:31:57,827
He hardly eats... hardly sleeps.

1109
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:02,499
Can't sit still... can't move.

1110
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:05,668
It's like he's just stewing.

1111
01:32:06,753 --> 01:32:08,170
Waiting for somethin'.

1112
01:32:09,171 --> 01:32:11,841
Waiting for whatever didn't happen
to happen.

1113
01:32:13,801 --> 01:32:17,388
Come on!
This bottle ain't gonna drink itself.

1114
01:32:18,681 --> 01:32:19,682
Whoo-hoo!

1115
01:32:20,892 --> 01:32:22,434
Already losing daylight!

1116
01:32:22,518 --> 01:32:26,355
Hold your horses. How you doin'?

1117
01:32:27,982 --> 01:32:31,027
I'd be happy to see me, too.

1118
01:33:02,391 --> 01:33:03,976
Woman, you ain't tired?

1119
01:33:04,769 --> 01:33:07,855
- We gotta let him go.
- We ain't holdin' him.

1120
01:33:07,939 --> 01:33:10,399
He's staying for us. I know he is.

1121
01:33:11,025 --> 01:33:12,484
Well, what if he wants to stay?

1122
01:33:14,946 --> 01:33:17,073
It's not always gonna be like this.

1123
01:33:20,367 --> 01:33:21,911
Soon as I'm healed...

1124
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:24,997
we'll move out of here.

1125
01:33:26,165 --> 01:33:27,333
We'll be okay.

1126
01:33:28,668 --> 01:33:31,754
He'll be okay once he has his own place.

1127
01:33:31,837 --> 01:33:33,047
We'll be okay?

1128
01:33:33,547 --> 01:33:35,758
I guarantee it.

1129
01:33:54,276 --> 01:33:55,612
Remember that?

1130
01:33:55,695 --> 01:33:58,865
Yes, I do.

1131
01:33:59,824 --> 01:34:03,953
You know what? You ain't supposed to be up
on that broke leg all the time, Jackson.

1132
01:34:05,246 --> 01:34:07,623
If you don't let it heal,
you ain't never gonna walk.

1133
01:34:08,499 --> 01:34:10,585
Why walk if I can't dance?

1134
01:34:11,335 --> 01:34:13,420
Lovely woman, you are.

1135
01:34:35,693 --> 01:34:36,944
Silver Star?

1136
01:34:37,904 --> 01:34:39,196
- Yeah.
- Damn.

1137
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,116
Don't be impressed.
I got it for being stupid.

1138
01:34:42,199 --> 01:34:44,368
What?

1139
01:34:46,037 --> 01:34:48,289
You ever miss it sometimes?
Being over there.

1140
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:53,836
I don't mean being shot at,
but sometimes, I actually miss it.

1141
01:34:58,549 --> 01:34:59,717
Yeah, me, too.

1142
01:35:03,262 --> 01:35:05,181
Over there, I was a liberator.

1143
01:35:07,725 --> 01:35:10,394
People lined up in the streets
waiting for us.

1144
01:35:11,771 --> 01:35:13,690
Throwing flowers and cheering.

1145
01:35:17,068 --> 01:35:19,654
And here,
I'm just another nigger pushing a plow.

1146
01:35:23,074 --> 01:35:24,658
Some of the men, too.

1147
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:30,623
- Yeah, I think about 'em every day.
- Seeing different parts of the world.

1148
01:35:31,498 --> 01:35:34,335
Italian girls, English girls...

1149
01:35:37,254 --> 01:35:41,425
Some of those hairy Greek girls
with those big old hairy muffs...

1150
01:35:41,508 --> 01:35:46,013
Yeah, it was somethin' else.
It was somethin', man.

1151
01:35:50,309 --> 01:35:52,269
You ever been with a white girl?

1152
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:08,953
Shit, well... I'll be damned. Huh?

1153
01:36:09,703 --> 01:36:11,831
Oh, yeah? Tell me.

1154
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:19,005
Army gave us separate barracks,

1155
01:36:19,088 --> 01:36:23,092
separate blood supply, separate latrines.

1156
01:36:28,722 --> 01:36:31,768
But them European girls
didn't have a problem with us at all.

1157
01:36:34,186 --> 01:36:36,063
One day, we were up in Wimborne,

1158
01:36:36,147 --> 01:36:38,983
old English girl walked past
and slapped me right on my butt.

1159
01:36:39,066 --> 01:36:40,484
Never laid eyes on her.

1160
01:36:41,193 --> 01:36:46,490
Said the white GI's told her
that we was more monkey than human.

1161
01:36:49,243 --> 01:36:50,702
And she was checking for a tail.

1162
01:36:52,288 --> 01:36:54,498
I'm sorry to laugh.

1163
01:36:55,374 --> 01:36:59,586
So every opportunity we got,
we showed 'em just how human we were.

1164
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:04,801
- Yep.
- German girls, too, huh?

1165
01:37:07,178 --> 01:37:08,179
Mm-hmm.

1166
01:37:10,514 --> 01:37:11,515
Uh-oh.

1167
01:37:12,183 --> 01:37:14,518
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1168
01:37:14,601 --> 01:37:16,437
I seen that look before.

1169
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,729
Huh?

1170
01:37:18,522 --> 01:37:20,482
She must have been somethin' special.

1171
01:37:30,910 --> 01:37:34,621
But that was then, this is now,
and I guess I'm right where I should be.

1172
01:37:35,414 --> 01:37:38,876
Yep. Right where I need to be.

1173
01:37:48,469 --> 01:37:50,637
Throwing my life away.

1174
01:38:24,171 --> 01:38:27,091
- I'll get you back safe, Rog.
- I'll hold you to that.

1175
01:38:27,674 --> 01:38:29,969
We got some coming on the left!

1176
01:38:30,052 --> 01:38:31,762
They took out the tail gunner!

1177
01:38:32,805 --> 01:38:35,307
Roger, come on, talk to me!

1178
01:39:00,041 --> 01:39:01,625
Oh, shit.

1179
01:39:20,394 --> 01:39:22,479
We'll get it hauled out tomorrow, Henry.

1180
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:36,744
I'm sorry.

1181
01:39:51,175 --> 01:39:53,760
Check? All right.

1182
01:39:59,683 --> 01:40:01,769
It's half past nine.
You just now gettin' up?

1183
01:40:05,314 --> 01:40:08,734
So I guess you gonna lay around all day
while your brothers and sisters work?

1184
01:40:09,693 --> 01:40:10,694
Hmm?

1185
01:40:10,777 --> 01:40:12,404
What's wrong with you, son?

1186
01:40:14,115 --> 01:40:15,824
What's wrong with you, boy?

1187
01:40:15,907 --> 01:40:18,827
Letter came for you.
Says it's all the way from Germany.

1188
01:40:19,495 --> 01:40:20,746
Germany.

1189
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:24,458
Who's, uh, Resl? Ress...

1190
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:27,003
Is that a man or a woman?

1191
01:40:27,086 --> 01:40:30,839
How you... R-E-S-L. Ressil, Reecil...
How you pronounce that?

1192
01:40:30,922 --> 01:40:32,258
Somebody that I knew.

1193
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:36,095
Where... Where you goin'?

1194
01:40:36,178 --> 01:40:37,471
I'll be back!

1195
01:40:37,554 --> 01:40:39,390
Ronsel!

1196
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:03,747
Oh, you think it's funny, do you?
Spilling good milk.

1197
01:41:04,206 --> 01:41:07,501
Well, you know what they say.
"No use crying over it."

1198
01:41:08,044 --> 01:41:11,213
Yeah, at least,
when it's somebody else's, that is.

1199
01:41:11,297 --> 01:41:15,926
What do I... what do I owe you here,
like, a buck fifty? Maybe two?

1200
01:41:16,009 --> 01:41:17,886
Let's just make it even.

1201
01:41:17,969 --> 01:41:20,972
- I'm not talkin' about money!
- What do you want from me?

1202
01:41:21,057 --> 01:41:22,724
What's the matter with you? Be a man!

1203
01:41:22,808 --> 01:41:24,893
Oh, yeah? One pail of spilled milk
and I ain't a man?

1204
01:41:24,977 --> 01:41:27,187
You sure as hell ain't actin' like it!

1205
01:41:27,688 --> 01:41:30,357
You come and go as you please,
you disappear for days on end,

1206
01:41:30,441 --> 01:41:32,318
and when you are here, you're drunk.

1207
01:41:32,401 --> 01:41:34,320
I don't answer to you.

1208
01:41:34,403 --> 01:41:36,988
When you're under my roof
and you work on my farm, you do.

1209
01:41:37,073 --> 01:41:38,699
Oh, I'm sorry there, Mr. Boss Man.

1210
01:41:38,782 --> 01:41:42,244
Ain't my fault your damn farmin' dreams
ain't working out.

1211
01:41:42,994 --> 01:41:45,872
Ain't my fault that
your damn cotton fields are flooded out!

1212
01:41:45,956 --> 01:41:49,210
You know your problem, Jamie?
You don't know your own worth, brother.

1213
01:41:49,293 --> 01:41:51,879
You don't know what a man needs to know.
A man ought to know.

1214
01:41:53,755 --> 01:41:56,383
- You better open your eyes, big brother.
- Open my eyes to what?

1215
01:41:56,467 --> 01:41:58,094
You're so busy walkin' around here

1216
01:41:58,177 --> 01:41:59,511
- like God Almighty...
- Huh?

1217
01:41:59,595 --> 01:42:01,012
Worryin' about yourself and your farm,

1218
01:42:01,097 --> 01:42:02,681
you can't even see
your own wife is miserable!

1219
01:42:02,764 --> 01:42:04,124
Just watch your mouth.

1220
01:42:10,189 --> 01:42:11,857
- Or what?
- Or what? Huh?

1221
01:42:20,574 --> 01:42:24,620
- Yep. You know what, brother?
- Yeah?

1222
01:42:24,703 --> 01:42:27,581
Fine, Jamie, go.
Be whatever kind of man you want to be.

1223
01:42:27,998 --> 01:42:29,583
Just do it someplace else.

1224
01:42:30,834 --> 01:42:34,087
- That's fine. I'll go to town.
- I'm not talkin' about town.

1225
01:42:34,171 --> 01:42:37,799
I'm going to Greenville tomorrow
for a few days to see about livestock.

1226
01:42:37,883 --> 01:42:40,219
I'll expect you gone when I get back.

1227
01:43:04,576 --> 01:43:06,328
What's wrong with you?

1228
01:43:19,299 --> 01:43:22,136
You should have seen the look
on your face.

1229
01:43:22,845 --> 01:43:23,887
It ain't funny.

1230
01:43:24,555 --> 01:43:27,015
Au contraire, my friend. It is indeed.

1231
01:43:27,516 --> 01:43:29,142
You about crazy as hell.

1232
01:43:29,685 --> 01:43:31,937
Well, I can't argue with that.

1233
01:43:32,521 --> 01:43:35,399
What you...
What you doin' walking in the rain?

1234
01:43:38,985 --> 01:43:40,737
It don't matter.

1235
01:43:45,826 --> 01:43:46,906
What's the matter with you?

1236
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:53,417
What's the worst thing you ever did?

1237
01:43:54,210 --> 01:43:56,212
Something bad.

1238
01:43:56,295 --> 01:43:58,505
Real bad and you knew
it was gonna hurt someone...

1239
01:44:01,008 --> 01:44:02,426
but you did it anyway.

1240
01:44:12,644 --> 01:44:14,438
Leavin' this woman right here.

1241
01:44:27,117 --> 01:44:28,285
Well, I'll be.

1242
01:44:29,703 --> 01:44:32,038
Congratulations, you're a father.

1243
01:44:35,166 --> 01:44:36,710
His name's Franz.

1244
01:44:38,003 --> 01:44:39,713
Franz, that's a good name.

1245
01:44:41,256 --> 01:44:42,591
What you gonna do now?

1246
01:44:46,177 --> 01:44:49,556
- She wants me to come back to Germany.
- That's a long haul.

1247
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:50,640
Yeah.

1248
01:44:52,225 --> 01:44:53,394
Long way.

1249
01:44:55,979 --> 01:44:58,440
So, what about you?
What's the worst thing you ever done?

1250
01:45:01,192 --> 01:45:04,070
Who, me? I'm a saint.

1251
01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:10,118
I bet. I bet.

1252
01:45:36,395 --> 01:45:37,813
Shit, put your head down.

1253
01:45:44,528 --> 01:45:46,279
You think they seen us?

1254
01:45:46,363 --> 01:45:47,906
I don't know.

1255
01:46:02,963 --> 01:46:04,298
Well, here we are.

1256
01:46:06,883 --> 01:46:08,134
Yeah.

1257
01:46:09,302 --> 01:46:10,971
Yeah, I'm leaving town soon.

1258
01:46:12,306 --> 01:46:13,626
I wanted to say good luck to you.

1259
01:46:15,684 --> 01:46:16,684
You've been a friend.

1260
01:46:19,145 --> 01:46:20,772
I want you to know that.

1261
01:46:23,317 --> 01:46:24,317
Yeah.

1262
01:46:29,239 --> 01:46:30,907
You've been a friend, too.

1263
01:46:33,494 --> 01:46:35,537
You might be one of the good ones.

1264
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:44,921
Take care.

1265
01:47:00,062 --> 01:47:02,189
I hope you find your way to your boy.

1266
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:08,278
To your family.

1267
01:47:17,746 --> 01:47:19,498
Take care of yourself, huh?

1268
01:47:21,792 --> 01:47:22,793
You, too.

1269
01:47:34,346 --> 01:47:35,346
Hey, Mama.

1270
01:47:35,764 --> 01:47:38,016
- You hungry?
- No, I'm good.

1271
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:40,018
Where is everybody?

1272
01:47:40,101 --> 01:47:42,438
Gone up to church. Late service.

1273
01:47:47,984 --> 01:47:49,069
Hmm.

1274
01:47:49,152 --> 01:47:50,529
Here.

1275
01:48:00,038 --> 01:48:05,669
- And there he is, drunk again.
- Uncle Jamie!

1276
01:48:05,752 --> 01:48:07,963
Hello there, dear family.

1277
01:48:08,797 --> 01:48:10,924
Who the hell was that with you
in the truck?

1278
01:48:11,007 --> 01:48:13,802
The one I seen you drivin'. Who was it?

1279
01:48:15,053 --> 01:48:16,304
Ronsel Jackson. What's it to you?

1280
01:48:16,388 --> 01:48:20,392
You wanna tell me why that nigger
was ridin' upside you in the truck

1281
01:48:20,475 --> 01:48:21,977
like two peas in a pod?

1282
01:48:23,228 --> 01:48:25,856
He can ride wherever I say. Anything else?

1283
01:48:25,939 --> 01:48:29,818
You. You son of a bitch.

1284
01:48:34,823 --> 01:48:38,076
- You ain't worth a damn, you know that?
- Yeah, I know that.

1285
01:48:38,159 --> 01:48:40,996
Mr. Big, Big War Hero, is ya?

1286
01:48:41,079 --> 01:48:44,457
You're nothin' but a damn drunk!
Give me them keys.

1287
01:48:45,291 --> 01:48:46,668
Just go.

1288
01:48:47,461 --> 01:48:49,880
Oh, you want him all to yourself,
huh, gal?

1289
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:52,674
Too bad he's all liquored up.
He can't do you any good.

1290
01:48:52,758 --> 01:48:55,135
- I beg your pardon?
- I seen you sniffin' after him.

1291
01:48:55,218 --> 01:48:59,473
- Pappy.
- Maybe Henry is too thick to notice,

1292
01:48:59,556 --> 01:49:00,556
but I ain't.

1293
01:49:44,267 --> 01:49:47,353
- You seen the letter, Mama?
- The one from Germany?

1294
01:49:47,437 --> 01:49:49,773
Oh, God, okay. All right. Hold on.

1295
01:49:49,856 --> 01:49:52,609
Don't fret. Just wait
till your father come back, okay?

1296
01:49:52,693 --> 01:49:55,236
Ronsel? Ronsel!

1297
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:00,950
Hi, there.

1298
01:50:01,451 --> 01:50:05,330
- You'll be here for supper tonight?
- Uh, no.

1299
01:50:08,124 --> 01:50:09,585
You goin' someplace?

1300
01:50:10,501 --> 01:50:13,046
Yeah. Might, uh, head out west.

1301
01:50:13,129 --> 01:50:15,757
Got a war buddy who lives in Los Angeles.

1302
01:50:15,841 --> 01:50:19,510
Los Angeles?
Jamie, what are you talking about?

1303
01:50:20,136 --> 01:50:22,973
- He didn't tell you?
- Who didn't tell me what?

1304
01:50:23,682 --> 01:50:24,682
Henry.

1305
01:50:25,684 --> 01:50:27,102
Told me to leave.

1306
01:50:28,979 --> 01:50:31,690
- Probably for the best.
- So just like that, you up and leave?

1307
01:50:32,398 --> 01:50:34,610
Were you even plannin' on sayin' goodbye?

1308
01:50:36,527 --> 01:50:40,490
'Course. First bus don't leave till 2:00.

1309
01:50:40,574 --> 01:50:43,326
What about the girls?
This will break their hearts.

1310
01:50:44,202 --> 01:50:45,871
Laura, I can't stay here.

1311
01:50:46,872 --> 01:50:47,872
I don't...

1312
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:53,795
You don't need to go, Jamie.

1313
01:51:54,522 --> 01:51:56,900
- Whoo! Come here!
- Get him!

1314
01:52:01,571 --> 01:52:03,651
- Come here, boy!
- Get him! Get him!

1315
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:06,409
Get him! Get him!

1316
01:52:11,581 --> 01:52:13,166
Hold him down, boys!

1317
01:52:17,253 --> 01:52:20,090
- Yeah, punch that nigger!
- Hit that nigger!

1318
01:52:24,302 --> 01:52:25,762
- Get him up.
- Come on.

1319
01:52:41,069 --> 01:52:43,363
Put your shoes on. Come with us.

1320
01:53:05,135 --> 01:53:08,138
- Good Lord. You turn him loose.
- Shut up!

1321
01:53:08,221 --> 01:53:10,515
Like hell, I will!
You turn him loose, damn it!

1322
01:53:10,598 --> 01:53:12,017
- You best listen, son.
- I ain't your son!

1323
01:53:13,059 --> 01:53:17,063
Now I suggest you use that thing,
or you better point elsewhere.

1324
01:53:17,147 --> 01:53:18,731
Otherwise, you better kill us both.

1325
01:53:18,815 --> 01:53:23,236
You betray your own blood
for the sake of a nigger?

1326
01:53:23,319 --> 01:53:24,320
You do it.

1327
01:53:24,404 --> 01:53:25,321
Come on!

1328
01:53:25,405 --> 01:53:28,283
- Go on. You do it.
- Bring forth the evidence.

1329
01:53:29,367 --> 01:53:31,411
- He's guilty!
- Kill him!

1330
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:35,915
Did you rut with this woman?

1331
01:53:35,999 --> 01:53:39,002
What the hell do you fellas care
about some Kraut whore anyway?

1332
01:53:39,502 --> 01:53:42,798
All those Fräulein cunts
got a lot of our boys killed.

1333
01:53:42,881 --> 01:53:44,007
I say if Ronsel here

1334
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:47,803
gave her a little half-breed bundle of joy
to remind her of it, I call it justice!

1335
01:53:47,886 --> 01:53:49,429
Shut up, nigger lover!

1336
01:53:49,512 --> 01:53:52,140
How the hell do you know
that Ronsel here's the father anyway?

1337
01:53:52,223 --> 01:53:54,767
Let's ask him.
Are you the father of this...

1338
01:53:54,851 --> 01:53:57,479
I ain't gonna say "child..."
This abomination?

1339
01:54:02,067 --> 01:54:04,152
Go on! Say it!

1340
01:54:09,574 --> 01:54:11,659
- Yes.
- He said it!

1341
01:54:11,742 --> 01:54:14,245
The penalty for abomination is death.

1342
01:54:17,123 --> 01:54:18,291
Huh?

1343
01:54:21,294 --> 01:54:22,628
Pappy?

1344
01:54:24,089 --> 01:54:25,090
Huh?

1345
01:54:26,757 --> 01:54:28,885
No.

1346
01:54:30,261 --> 01:54:31,804
He ain't gonna shoot.

1347
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:39,855
You don't have the balls
to kill a man up close, do you, son?

1348
01:54:41,106 --> 01:54:43,108
Unh-unh.

1349
01:54:44,692 --> 01:54:47,028
You ain't gonna kill your own Pappy.

1350
01:55:16,391 --> 01:55:20,145
You make one more wrong move,
these boys are liable to kill you.

1351
01:55:21,521 --> 01:55:22,813
What we gonna do with him?

1352
01:55:22,897 --> 01:55:26,734
I already told you, he won't talk.
Ain't that right, son?

1353
01:55:27,568 --> 01:55:29,237
You set him loose.

1354
01:55:30,821 --> 01:55:34,034
You ain't exactly in a position
to be making demands.

1355
01:55:35,243 --> 01:55:37,412
Nigger still needs to be punished.

1356
01:55:39,330 --> 01:55:42,125
You let my son there decide how.

1357
01:55:43,418 --> 01:55:44,878
All right, then.

1358
01:55:46,254 --> 01:55:48,590
What'll it be?

1359
01:55:48,923 --> 01:55:51,217
I'll give you a choice.

1360
01:55:52,177 --> 01:55:56,472
You don't want him killed,
then you decide the punishment.

1361
01:55:56,848 --> 01:55:58,057
No!

1362
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:03,021
His tongue, his eyes, or his balls?

1363
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:05,773
Choose.

1364
01:56:12,405 --> 01:56:14,490
Choose, God damn it!

1365
01:56:26,252 --> 01:56:28,046
His tongue.

1366
01:57:02,247 --> 01:57:04,415
- Hold him up.
- Get the ladder!

1367
01:57:06,417 --> 01:57:07,794
Take your time.
Gonna be all right.

1368
01:57:11,506 --> 01:57:12,506
I got you.

1369
01:57:13,174 --> 01:57:15,468
- Hold his legs out.
- Hold them out, straight.

1370
01:57:15,926 --> 01:57:18,471
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1371
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:48,084
It's gonna be all right.
Hold that light up, Marlon.

1372
01:57:50,336 --> 01:57:51,879
Lift him up. Lift him up.

1373
01:58:06,894 --> 01:58:09,022
I held his heartbeat in my hand.

1374
01:58:10,606 --> 01:58:12,067
My boy!

1375
01:58:12,150 --> 01:58:13,901
I remember every beat.

1376
01:58:15,861 --> 01:58:17,613
He was warm and alive.

1377
01:58:20,783 --> 01:58:22,868
I know every place in him.

1378
01:59:31,312 --> 01:59:33,106
Pappy?

1379
01:59:34,857 --> 01:59:36,109
Pappy?

1380
01:59:41,281 --> 01:59:42,990
It's exactly what you think it is.

1381
01:59:46,119 --> 01:59:47,870
They got Ronsel.

1382
01:59:50,123 --> 01:59:51,832
There were too many of them.

1383
01:59:53,083 --> 01:59:56,003
What? Jamie, what happened to him?

1384
01:59:56,086 --> 01:59:57,630
They were too many of 'em. I...

1385
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:01,301
- Jamie...
- I couldn't stop 'em.

1386
02:00:02,426 --> 02:00:04,762
What did they do to him? Is he alive?

1387
02:00:05,388 --> 02:00:08,183
- They made me choose.
- Choose what?

1388
02:00:11,394 --> 02:00:12,562
Wake up.

1389
02:00:20,278 --> 02:00:23,113
I wanted to make sure
I looked you in the eye.

1390
02:01:02,570 --> 02:01:05,740
I appreciate it, sir. I'll, uh...

1391
02:01:06,407 --> 02:01:08,701
I'll see you in a couple of days, huh?

1392
02:01:21,214 --> 02:01:24,967
It's your father. He died last night.

1393
02:01:30,014 --> 02:01:33,934
- How?
- In his sleep, peacefully.

1394
02:01:59,877 --> 02:02:01,296
- Hap!
- Henry.

1395
02:02:02,087 --> 02:02:03,589
- Hap!
- Henry, don't.

1396
02:02:03,673 --> 02:02:05,758
It ain't my fault what happened.

1397
02:02:05,841 --> 02:02:08,177
- I warned that boy. Warned both of 'em.
- Just let 'em go.

1398
02:02:08,261 --> 02:02:09,345
Hap!

1399
02:02:09,887 --> 02:02:11,347
Hap, can you hold on?

1400
02:02:18,479 --> 02:02:20,815
Need to get the coffin in the ground.

1401
02:02:28,448 --> 02:02:29,490
Hap?

1402
02:02:41,001 --> 02:02:42,002
Hap?

1403
02:02:49,093 --> 02:02:50,093
Appreciate it.

1404
02:02:55,808 --> 02:02:56,928
Why don't you use your boys?

1405
02:02:57,393 --> 02:02:59,770
My sons are not gettin' down
out of that wagon.

1406
02:03:01,981 --> 02:03:03,148
Okay.

1407
02:03:07,236 --> 02:03:08,153
There we go.

1408
02:03:08,237 --> 02:03:12,033
"Man who is born of a woman
is of few days and full of trouble."

1409
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:15,370
He cometh forth like a flower
and is cut down.

1410
02:03:15,453 --> 02:03:18,497
He fleeth as a shadow and continueth not.

1411
02:03:19,039 --> 02:03:21,751
And doth thou open thine eyes
upon such a one,

1412
02:03:21,834 --> 02:03:24,253
and bringest me into judgment with thee?

1413
02:03:25,004 --> 02:03:29,216
Who can bring a clean thing
out of an unclean? Not one.

1414
02:03:29,884 --> 02:03:31,051
For there is hope of a tree,

1415
02:03:31,135 --> 02:03:33,888
if it be cut down,
that it will sprout again.

1416
02:03:34,805 --> 02:03:37,099
But man dieth and wasteth away.

1417
02:03:37,683 --> 02:03:40,520
As the waters fell from the sea
and drieth up,

1418
02:03:40,603 --> 02:03:43,314
so man lieth down and riseth not.

1419
02:03:44,565 --> 02:03:48,486
'Til the heavens be no more,
they shall not awake,

1420
02:03:48,569 --> 02:03:50,780
"nor be raised out of their sleep."

1421
02:03:54,659 --> 02:03:55,701
Amen.

1422
02:03:57,202 --> 02:03:59,246
- Amen.
- Amen.

1423
02:04:07,630 --> 02:04:08,672
All right, then.

1424
02:04:09,549 --> 02:04:12,593
Come on, brother. Amen, Pappy.

1425
02:04:26,399 --> 02:04:28,159
- Come on, girls.
- Florence?

1426
02:04:31,236 --> 02:04:32,780
Give this to Ronsel...

1427
02:04:37,493 --> 02:04:39,161
if you see him.

1428
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:05,855
Jamie!

1429
02:05:08,941 --> 02:05:10,192
Jamie!

1430
02:05:16,449 --> 02:05:17,825
Jamie!

1431
02:05:26,959 --> 02:05:28,836
My nightmare's always the same.

1432
02:05:31,088 --> 02:05:33,382
First, I'm in a tank wearing a helmet.

1433
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:38,012
Then I'm in the back of a car
with a burlap sack over my head.

1434
02:05:39,972 --> 02:05:44,351
I scream.
My lips move, and I can feel the strain.

1435
02:05:45,310 --> 02:05:47,146
But there's nothing coming out.

1436
02:05:50,983 --> 02:05:52,985
I hope that my pappy's untimely death

1437
02:05:53,068 --> 02:05:55,946
brought the Jackson family
some measure of peace.

1438
02:05:56,989 --> 02:05:59,449
Though I must admit it brings me none.

1439
02:06:02,202 --> 02:06:04,371
All the while hoping that,
by some miracle,

1440
02:06:04,454 --> 02:06:06,916
- my friend Ronsel found happiness.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1441
02:06:11,837 --> 02:06:13,673
But should my story end there?

1442
02:06:15,424 --> 02:06:17,176
Silenced and defeated?

1443
02:06:18,677 --> 02:06:22,723
Oppression, fear, deformity.

1444
02:06:24,725 --> 02:06:27,728
It would take an extraordinary man
to beat all that.

1445
02:06:29,605 --> 02:06:32,399
I would have to wean myself off
laudanum and self-pity...

1446
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:36,946
and travel with a little card
in my shirt pocket that said "mute."

1447
02:06:41,825 --> 02:06:43,118
And then, finally...

1448
02:06:44,411 --> 02:06:47,206
I would have to cross the Atlantic
yet again.

1449
02:06:50,292 --> 02:06:51,835
This time not for war.

1450
02:06:55,756 --> 02:06:57,174
But for love.

1451
02:06:58,425 --> 02:07:00,052
Ronsel.

1452
02:07:03,598 --> 02:07:04,724
Mama?

1453
02:07:33,460 --> 02:07:35,295
And so I ended with that.

1454
02:07:39,091 --> 02:07:40,175
With love.

1454
02:07:41,305 --> 02:08:41,376

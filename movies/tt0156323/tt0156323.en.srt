1
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:54,000
Willard, bring in
the videocassette recorder.

2
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,083
Aah!

3
00:01:30,834 --> 00:01:34,291
Suddenly, I realized that,
uh, I don't have a pension plan.

4
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:38,417
I don't have a health plan.
I don't have a dental plan.

5
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,458
I don't have--

6
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,542
Willard.

7
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,208
Willard!

8
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:37,000
Willard!

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,375
Willard!

10
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:43,625
Willard!

11
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,708
Where the hell
is my blue hat?

12
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,542
I, uh, I don't know,
Miss Crock.

13
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:52,166
Do you expect me
to go to my 10:00 meeting
like this?

14
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,417
Oh, no, no.
Absolutely not, Miss Crock.

15
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,542
I'll-- I'll help you
find it.

16
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:11,542
I'm cold!
Taking a coffee break,
lazy bones?

17
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:14,083
All right,
this is a good job.
This is a good job.

18
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,125
Aha!
I should have known
it was you.

19
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:34,750
Uh, you know, Miss Crock,
you have such an appreciation
of fine clothing,

20
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,583
I was thinking
maybe it was time
you buy me a new uniform.

21
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:41,000
You look just fine
to me, Willard.

22
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,125
And you're dismissed.

23
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,625
But it's disintegrating.
The buttons are barely
hanging on.

24
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,250
Oh, Willard,
that is a terrific suit.

25
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,750
Your father worked
for me for 30 years.

26
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,333
Wore that suit every day.
Never complained.

27
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,583
Yeah, and then he died,
and then at the funeral,

28
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,792
you made the undertaker
give it back to you...

29
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:02,583
so you could stick me in it
for another 15 years.

30
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,458
Just what
are you implying?

31
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,125
Miss Crock,
it's Christmastime.

32
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,792
I'm only asking
for a new uniform.

33
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,125
Only a new uniform?

34
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,500
And pretty soon it'll be
only a new broom, maybe.

35
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,750
And before you know it,
I will be only bankrupt.

36
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,083
Now, would you please
get out of my sight...

37
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:29,000
before I kick you
in the ass?

38
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:46,542
It's not my fault you have
frost on your strawberries.

39
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:49,166
We have a contract.

40
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:53,542
Oh, well, then,
I'll see you in court.

41
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:57,166
Excuse me, ma'am.
I've got the Danish.

42
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,917
Okay, bring them in.

43
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:02,375
Miss crock,
I'd like you to meet...

44
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,583
Gunn Froling,
Erland Vetterlund,

45
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,625
Per Malmsjo
and Bertil Guve.

46
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,917
The executive team
from Copenhagen Snak Food.

47
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:13,291
I'm just flattered
that you're even considering
my little factory.

48
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,875
Ja.
Ja.
Lovely output.

49
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,708
Oh, that's terrific, Gunn.
You are truly a great Dane.

50
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:24,041
Come, gentlemen.
I'd like to show you
the bun room.

51
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,041
I'm sure
you're gonna love it.

52
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,125
It's just past
jellies and creams.

53
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,208
What a bunch of bores.

54
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:35,166
I never know what the hell
those guys are saying.

55
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,834
Never mind about that.
Do you think
we've got a deal?

56
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:39,792
Does Big Boy
have a weight problem?

57
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:42,750
Mm-hmm.
Soon you're going to be
the richest,

58
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,083
prettiest, sexiest lady
in the entire pastry industry.

59
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,500
I've told you, Chip,

60
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,708
not in the office.

61
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:21,083
Hey, nothing says
Christmas eve like some
hot spicy chicken wings.

62
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,083
All right!

63
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,083
If they're so goddamn yummy,
how come you only show up
when it's free?

64
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,959
- Hey, there he is.
- About time.

65
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,000
Can you believe it?
The old prune had me
cleaning her chimney.

66
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,458
Oh, she thinks
Santa's coming
to pay her a visit.

67
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:44,667
Now, look here.
Be careful with this
'cause it's kind of strong.

68
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,750
Willard, you need to make
a new year's resolution--

69
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,875
quit working
for the ball buster.

70
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,792
Show her who's boss, man.
Take a shit in her soup.

71
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,000
Thanks. That's
real constructive.

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,708
You know the way things are:
a man has a job,
he holds onto it.

73
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,917
In your case,
till he dies of old age.

74
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,125
Yeah, like my old man.

75
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,542
You know what he said
to me on his deathbed?

76
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:14,667
He said,
"Stick with Miss Crock.
You'll get ahead."

77
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't know what
he was talking about.

78
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,333
Merry Christmas, Willard.

79
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,583
Merry Christmas, Rusty.

80
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,166
# Good King Wenceslas
looked out #

81
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,667
# On the feast
of Stephen #

82
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:32,417
Oh, chip,
it's beautiful.

83
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,417
Now open yours.

84
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,458
Oh, I'm so excited.

85
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,083
Oh, Virginia,
what a sweet gift!

86
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,959
Well, I know how much
you like money.
It's $50,000.

87
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,500
You can buy anything
you want with it.

88
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,166
What are you standing
around for, Willard?

89
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,834
We don't want a mess now,
do we, on Christmas?

90
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,875
Will that be all?

91
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,708
That will not be all.

92
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,792
Merry Christmas.

93
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,250
Miss Crock,
I wasn't expecting this.

94
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,333
I thought of something,
and I knew you'd be thrilled
to death with it.

95
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:32,208
Oh, Miss Crock,
God bless you.

96
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,792
Open it! Open it!
You are
a good woman.

97
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:39,250
- Hey, what's this?
- Your favorite.

98
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,625
Mincemeat pie.

99
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,875
Where the hell
is my suit?

100
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:48,708
Oh, goodness gracious.
Sakes alive.
I thought you'd like it.

101
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,834
Like it?
Yes.

102
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,834
I-I put
a pair of cuff links
in there as well.

103
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:57,083
Oh, you went all out,
didn't you?

104
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,875
A pair of
crackerjack cuff links
and one shitty pie!

105
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,458
Hey. Hey, man.
What are you doing?

106
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,125
I thought we were going to
Leroy's Christmas kegger?

107
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,125
Yeah, well, Miss Crock
said I gotta spend a night
in the box.

108
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:16,333
Damn, it's like
a Filipino prison.

109
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,750
Get in that sweatbox!
Leave me alone!

110
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,417
Fine.

111
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:27,625
Uh, feliz navidad.

112
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,083
Oh, just in case
you get hungry.

113
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,792
- Beat it.
- This is my dinner.

114
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:50,792
Oh, you rat,
I'll squash you.

115
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,959
Come here.

116
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,959
Whoa.

117
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:07,458
I can't believe
I've tolerated him
for as long as I have.

118
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,166
He's just a user.
Willard's exploited
your generosity.

119
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,667
That's exactly right.

120
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:16,458
I mean, his father,
Teddy, was a nice man.

121
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,000
- But enough is enough.
- Really.

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,458
Well, tomorrow, we'll--
we'll fire him.

123
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,291
Throw his stuff
in the furnace.

124
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,375
Santa Claus must be stopped.

125
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,166
- There will be no Christmas
this year.
- You got that right.

126
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,542
You're not gonna
believe this.

127
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:42,250
The old grinch
is gonna fire me.

128
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,750
That's ridiculous, man.
Why would somebody fire
their slave?

129
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,708
Because she's mean.
She picked Christmas day
to do it.

130
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,500
Damn!
You need revenge.

131
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Revenge!
We need revenge!

132
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,583
Revenge!
We need revenge!

133
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:02,083
Let's kidnap Santa Claus.
We'll break into his North Pole
toy shop and seize him.

134
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:07,166
Maybe those moon men
are, uh, are onto something.

135
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,667
You mean we should
kidnap Santa?

136
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,500
Wait a minute.
Why don't we just kidnap
Miss Crock?

137
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,250
That's crazy.
No, that's brilliant.

138
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,500
We'll grab granny,
we'll hold her ass
for ransom.

139
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,458
And if they don't pay,
we start hacking off
her fingers.

140
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,750
First her thumb,
then her pointer,

141
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,750
then her little
nasty finger.

142
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,708
Hey, man, what are you
talking about?

143
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,834
We're not criminals.
You fry chicken,
I drive a car.

144
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:33,250
When that money
comes rolling in,
I'll go crazy, man.

145
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,333
I'll-- I'll laminate
my menus.

146
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,583
Hey, shut up, okay?

147
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,083
We know nothing about
kidnapping an old lady.

148
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,125
Hey, but
what about her dog?

149
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,125
You mean Biscuit?
No, Muffin.

150
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,667
Yeah, she loves him
more than anything
in the world.

151
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:53,792
I bet she'd pay plenty
for that old bag of fleas.

152
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:57,708
Yeah, I bet she'd pay
a million bucks.

153
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:01,542
# A million bucks
a million bucks #

154
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:08,458
# A million bucks
a million bucks #

155
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,708
Remember,
we have to be quiet
inside the house.

156
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,792
Miss Crock
is a light sleeper.

157
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,959
You ain't gotta worry
about me.

158
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,792
This place is nice.

159
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,125
What the hell
are you doing?

160
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,166
I'm checking for
electric eyes.

161
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,041
There's no electric eyes.

162
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,333
How do you know that?
They're invisible.
Trust me.

163
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,625
I've lived here
my entire life.

164
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,125
So, this is where
the old bitch sleeps, huh?

165
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,125
Shh.

166
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,500
Okay, give me the weenie.

167
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,041
Okay, Muffin.
I have a special treat
for you.

168
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,083
Oh, cripes.

169
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,583
What kind of aim
was that?

170
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:40,792
Muffin, Muffin,
bite my weenie.

171
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:54,875
Oh, the hell with this.
Plan B.

172
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,333
Will you shut
that dog up?

173
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,166
Aah!

174
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,375
- Shh.
- You bastard!

175
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,667
Oh. Mm. Shh.

176
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:21,542
Aah!

177
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:32,333
Aah!

178
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,542
Hey, would you
keep it down?

179
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:39,125
Ow! Keep it down?
This thing is eating
my hand!

180
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,125
Aah!

181
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:48,166
Oh, Jesus,
this is a nightmare!

182
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,125
Put him in the box!

183
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,125
Who's smarter, huh?
Now who's smarter?

184
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,959
What should it say?

185
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,375
Um, um, we've got him.

186
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:12,291
Pay us $1 million,
or he's a dead dog!

187
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,792
How does that sound?
Fine.

188
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:17,041
Let's get
the hell out of here.

189
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:34,834
One million dollars!
This is the happiest day
of my life.

190
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,291
- Yeah, with that money,
we can do anything.
- I know what I'm gonna do.

191
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,500
I'm gonna buy me
a four-star chicken hole.

192
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
I'll get a better
neighborhood and a listing
in the Zagat guide.

193
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,333
I'm gonna go someplace warm
where you don't need
layered clothing.

194
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,333
Start over. I got
some good years left in me.
I can better myself.

195
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,834
I'm gonna register
at one of them
four-year universities.

196
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:13,041
My friend, here's
to second chances.

197
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:19,917
Did you have
a lovely sleep, Muffin?
Oh, yes.

198
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:23,917
Now we'll have
a lovely breakfast,
you and--

199
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,583
oh, my... God!

200
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:36,417
Oh, my God.
Look at me.

201
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:41,458
Muffin, look
what they've done
to your mother.

202
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,625
I don't know--

203
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,875
"We've got him.

204
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:53,125
Pay us $1 million,
or he's a dead dog."

205
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,125
Who's a dead dog?

206
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,458
Willard? Willard!

207
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,792
Man, we've got
so many choices.

208
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,875
I'm just trying
to get out
of Pittsburgh.

209
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,834
You said it.
Hey, check out this, huh?
Bora Bora.

210
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:10,875
I was thinking more
like the Caribbean
myself.

211
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,417
Yeah, well, whichever one
has a school with a strong
liberal arts program.

212
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,333
Oh, my lord!
I'm dead!

213
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,834
We're going to jail.
What do you mean "we"?

214
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,333
That's my picture
on the front page.

215
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,458
Who would have thought
kidnapping a dog would make
the front page?

216
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,792
Wait a minute.
They think it was me.

217
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:39,333
They think I was kidnapped.
They-- they don't even
mention Muffin.

218
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,667
Ridiculous.
Why would somebody
kidnap you?

219
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,750
I don't know,
but they think someone did.

220
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,834
"There were signs
of a scuffle,

221
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,875
"the chauffeur's blood
was found on the wall...

222
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:53,708
and a note demanded
one million dollars,
or he's a dead dog."

223
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:12,542
Sweet Jesus!
We kidnapped a turd.

224
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,542
According to sources,
the missing chauffeur...

225
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:17,792
had been a loyal employee
for over 15 years.

226
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:21,000
Virginia Crock,
known for her
mouthwatering treats,

227
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,208
awoke this morning to news
that was not so sweet.

228
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,917
Do you have
any enemies?

229
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:43,458
Not that I know of.
I'm just an elderly lady
who makes pies.

230
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,834
Well, uh,
does Mr. Fillmore
have any enemies?

231
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:51,667
Who?
That's Willard's
last name.

232
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,542
Oh.

233
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,917
Not that I know of.

234
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:59,500
Did he have anybody
that he used to, uh,
bring around the house?

235
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,708
Not that I know of.

236
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,250
Does he have
any living relatives?

237
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,083
Not that I know of.

238
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:16,250
Ma'am, excuse me,
but, uh,

239
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,667
this man worked for you
for over a decade,

240
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:24,625
and you don't know
if he has any friends
or any relatives?

241
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,875
Detective, Miss Crock
has told you
everything she knows.

242
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,125
What are you talking about?
She hasn't told me anything.

243
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,959
Sir, if it
makes you happy,

244
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:35,792
you go right ahead
and find Willard Fillmore.

245
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,125
As for me,

246
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,125
it's time for my nap.

247
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,000
According to sources,

248
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,959
Fillmore moved to Pittsburgh
at the age of six.

249
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,166
Here's the thing.
I hardly knew Willard.

250
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,750
Police say if you have
any information,

251
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,750
call the Pie Hunt hotline
at 1-800--

252
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,500
How did this get so big?
Rusty, we gotta
turn ourselves in.

253
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,417
How? They think
you're the victim.

254
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:05,166
Shit. You have to be
really dumb to accidentally
kidnap yourself.

255
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,750
Wait a minute.
This is all gonna
get pinned on me!

256
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,208
You gotta get un-kidnapped!
You gotta escape!

257
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,208
The kidnappers,
they go out to dinner,

258
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,166
you chew through the ropes,
you get away.

259
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,708
Yeah, that's good.
That's good, but--
but it should be real.

260
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,875
Uh, there was a struggle,
and I got all bruised
and beat up.

261
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,500
This is an airtight alibi.

262
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,917
Here.
Let me help you.
Good. Good.

263
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,500
You like that, right?
Yeah, wait a minute.
Oh!

264
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,500
What?
Oh, I got an idea.

265
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:44,000
What are we worried about?
Why don't I just
stay kidnapped?

266
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,041
Why?
It makes perfect sense.

267
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,166
Instead of them paying
a million dollars
for Muffin,

268
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,458
they pay it for me.

269
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,583
Why would somebody pay
a million dollars for you?

270
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,333
'Cause I'm a man.
Muffin's a dog.

271
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,041
But he got a pedigree.
Gimme a break.
I'm better than he is.

272
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:06,041
Come on!
I'm better than a dog!

273
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,208
I'm five times better.

274
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:14,375
"Five million dollars."

275
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,000
It's repugnant.

276
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,417
It's like
a rising stock.

277
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:23,083
Why did he jump
from one to five?

278
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:35,208
All right now, let's see
some real emotion here.
You're kidnapped.

279
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,792
Let's see some tears.
I want to feel
something real.

280
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:42,750
- And action.
- Help! Save me!

281
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,583
Miss Crock,
I'm begging you,
please, oh!

282
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:52,083
Hey, whoa.
I got into MSNBC.
How do you plug that camera in?

283
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,625
I think like this.

284
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,917
And in a startling development
in the Pittsburgh kidnapping,

285
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:06,291
this shocking videotape
was e-mailed to MSNBC.

286
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:09,750
Help, Miss Crock, save me.
I'm begging you.

287
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,917
They got me
wearing chains!

288
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:14,917
I'm living in a-a cage.

289
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:18,625
Oh, they're gonna kill me.
They're gonna kill me
if you don't pay.

290
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,959
Oh, open your wallet,
you tight ass!

291
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:25,583
Jesus, somebody
has to do something.
Oh!

292
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,583
Dinnertime, dog.

293
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,625
Oh!

294
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,959
They got me
eating kibble. Aah!

295
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,375
I don't know
how much longer
I can last.

296
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:44,041
Oh, God, Chip.
He's wearing a collar.

297
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:48,166
Oh, collars don't hurt.
He's trying to intimidate us.

298
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,125
Ow! What is that?

299
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,250
Oh, is that urine?
Oh, it is!

300
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,542
- It is!
- It's human urine!

301
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:59,708
Chip, we're late.

302
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,667
Miss Crock! Miss Crock!

303
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:04,083
Do you have a reaction
to the kibble video?
I don't--

304
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,333
Have you changed your mind
about paying the ransom?

305
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,000
Miss Crock will not deal
with criminals.
This is a police matter.

306
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Your chauffeur was
chained up like a dog.
Don't you have any compassion?

307
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,667
I'll show you compassion.

308
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:18,291
Get your asses
off my property!

309
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,708
I'm afraid
you didn't hear me.

310
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:25,041
I'm afraid
you didn't hear me!

311
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:28,375
Today, dessert baron
Virginia Crock reiterated...

312
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:31,208
she will not
pay the ransom.

313
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,875
We went to
the man in the street
to find out what he thinks.

314
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:36,417
She-- she's rich.
She can afford it.

315
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:40,375
If I worked for that
slut,

316
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:44,792
I'd tell her to
get down, get busy
on my , man.

317
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:48,667
More concerned citizens
have started a formal protest.

318
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:51,417
No more pies
if Willard dies!

319
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:54,500
Hey, is that Hillary?

320
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,750
Oh, she's looking good.

321
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:08,750
- Whoo!
- Rich people are no good.

322
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,083
I never gonna eat
her pie again.

323
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,458
This media blitz
is killing us.

324
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,708
Our sales
have dropped 50%.

325
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:32,375
Miss Crock, go to hell.
Miss Crock--

326
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:41,083
Miss Crock,
many bad things
are happened.

327
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:44,041
We thought we were buying
your wholesome
American image.

328
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:48,625
But it's terrible shock
that you don't rescue
your loyal houseman.

329
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:51,333
Sweet old lady on pie box
is now super-villain.

330
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,250
I'm sorry, honey.
They're playing hardball.

331
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,917
If you don't pay up,
they're gonna walk.

332
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,625
Fuck!

333
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,625
Of course
I'm gonna pay the ransom.

334
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:13,583
I just didn't want
to encourage those
underworld criminals.

335
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:16,583
But now I want Willard
home again with me.

336
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:20,667
The old hag
is coughing up!

337
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:23,708
Thank you, Miss Crook.
And thank you Hillary
for kicking her ass.

338
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:26,166
I'm free!

339
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,166
We are millionaires!
Millionaires!

340
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,500
Anybody here?
Hello?

341
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,000
Hey, what can I do
for you?

342
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Are you Rusty P. Hayes?

343
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,333
Yes, I am.
Can I interest you
in my shrimp boat special?

344
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,208
No, I'm here investigating
the kidnapping
of Willard Fillmore.

345
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:50,333
- Who?
- You must have read
about him.

346
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,959
I don't read newspapers.

347
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,000
We thought
you might know him.

348
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,041
We were going through
Mr. Fillmore's belongings,

349
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:02,792
and we found this, uh,
chicken dinner special
punch card.

350
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:06,917
Oh, really.
Oh, yeah, this guy.

351
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,708
I was wondering
what happened to him.
He was kidnapped.

352
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:12,708
Look. When he came
in here, did he, uh,

353
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:17,166
ever do anything unusual
that would draw attention
to him?

354
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:22,208
Well, one time I seen him
eat 50 chicken gizzards
all by himself.

355
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:27,250
- Oh.
- Look, if you come across
anything that might help us,

356
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,333
give me a call.
Sure.

357
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:34,041
I hate loose ends,
and I want this case to end.

358
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:54,083
I was so scared, I thought
I was gonna pee in my pants.

359
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:56,417
He knows something.
He had a funny look
on his face.

360
00:27:56,417 --> 00:28:00,166
Why'd you have to
tell him so much?
I didn't tell him nothing.

361
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,583
All I told him
was about the time you
ate 50 chicken gizzards.

362
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:06,417
That wasn't me.
That was some Chinese guy.

363
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,583
Oh, Fong did do that,
didn't he?

364
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,625
I'm telling you
we got problems.

365
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:12,708
That evil Kojak
hates loose ends.

366
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:15,792
And when they pay
and I don't show up,
that's a loose end.

367
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:19,625
He'll go nuts.
But you'll be someplace
nice, like Jamaica.

368
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,583
Yeah, well,
he'll track me there.
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

369
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:25,333
What if we fooled them
and made them think
I was dead?

370
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:28,083
Like, uh, like maybe
if we borrowed a corpse.

371
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:31,750
Hey, don't we know somebody
who knows somebody
who works at the morgue?

372
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,125
Hillary.
Yeah, Hillary used to live
across the street...

373
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,667
from a fat dude who was
in the army with this guy
who worked at the morgue.

374
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:40,375
Oh, I forgot
it was Hillary.

375
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:43,125
Oh, yeah, you can't
hit her up, man.

376
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,083
She just walked
a picket line for you.

377
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:05,792
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

378
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:07,875
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

379
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:10,041
I never thought
I'd see you again,
and here you are.

380
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:13,750
I brought you flowers.
Oh, my God.

381
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,917
Wow. You're such
a class act.

382
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:18,875
You get ransomed,
then you buy me flowers.

383
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:23,000
Well, I didn't
get ransomed, per se.

384
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,333
Did you escape?
No, I didn't escape
literally.

385
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:36,333
- Aah!
- Shit.

386
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:42,375
Where'd they go?

387
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,083
All right,
how did you do it?

388
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,917
It was really no problem.

389
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,166
I told her the truth,
we had a little sex,

390
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,208
she told me
the guy's name, Grover.

391
00:29:56,208 --> 00:30:00,000
Damn. Did all that
in ten minutes.

392
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,375
Ooh, spooky.

393
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,333
Grover?

394
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:45,208
Grover.

395
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,583
Hmm?

396
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:53,041
Hey, what are you doing?
Get away from that.

397
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:57,625
I'm-- I'm sorry.
Oh, it's just a rock.

398
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,875
Oh, it's not
just a rock.

399
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:04,583
It's a pet rock.

400
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:07,041
Oh, jeez, a pet rock.

401
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,250
Man, I haven't seen
one of these in years.

402
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,166
Yeah. I just dug it out
of his colon.

403
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:16,000
- Aah!
- Oh.

404
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,125
Yeah, yeah,
it's still warm.

405
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,750
I got a whole collection.

406
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,041
Yeah, it's--
it's really amazing...

407
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:30,041
what you dig out of
the inside of dead people
when you cut them open.

408
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,792
People swallow everything.
Here's some dice.

409
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,041
The guy must have been
to Vegas.

410
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:39,291
Yeah, got all kinds
of stuff here.

411
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:42,667
This beautiful harmonica.

412
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,792
Oh, oh, don't put that
in your mouth.

413
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:49,291
This is interesting here.
Ah, yes.

414
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:53,708
You gotta go in that way.
It couldn't have gone it
this way.

415
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,959
He would have noticed.
A broom.

416
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,375
Oh.

417
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:04,208
Oop! Where'd it go?

418
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:08,625
Ooh, forget about it.
Oh, he's dead,
and then you find it.

419
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:11,000
You know, it's all kinds
of stuff like that.

420
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,917
Oh, this is good.
Yeah. This is a clicker.

421
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:18,083
Hey, honey,
where's the clicker?

422
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,583
I don't know.

423
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:24,500
Inside me.
Here. Look at this.

424
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,250
A perfectly good comb.

425
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,834
Grover, how would you
like to make $100,000?

426
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,542
That's a lot of cheese.
What do I got to do?

427
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:41,041
Well, I want... people
to think that I'm dead.

428
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,333
Dead?

429
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,542
Yeah, you just take
one of those dead bodies...

430
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:50,000
and dress it up
like my man Willard here,

431
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,083
and when they find it,
they think it's him.

432
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,875
Oh, oh, you think
it's that easy?

433
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,041
I can just take up
any old body
and give it to you?

434
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,333
I-I got filing slips.

435
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:02,208
My bodies are catalogued.
This is a tight ship.

436
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,708
Uh, why don't you
just take some old bum
that nobody would notice?

437
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,750
A bum? Hmm.

438
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,291
Come on, man. If you do it,
there's a hundred grand
in it for you.

439
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:14,291
- Will it show up on my W-2?
- No. No, tax-free.

440
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,500
Okay, good.
Because why should my money...

441
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
go to pave roads
and build schools?

442
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,041
Yeah, good point.
Listen. This is the plan.

443
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:26,083
Dump the body tomorrow night
and make sure you get somebody
that looks like me, okay?

444
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,125
No problem.
Piece of cake.

445
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:31,208
Now, here's
some clothes of mine
that you can put on him.

446
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,708
And, uh, I got
my driver's license.

447
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:36,166
You put that
in his pocket.
Yes.

448
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,750
And, uh,
here's some jewelry.

449
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,417
Jewelry.
Oh, those are nice.

450
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:47,041
Oh, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

451
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,417
Isn't this suit
kind of ratty?

452
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:52,667
Ain't it gonna be
degrading for a dead man
to have to wear this trash?

453
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,583
Just do it.

454
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:58,834
All right.
All right.
I'll do it.

455
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:02,250
Miss Crock,
I just want to thank you...

456
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,750
for agreeing
to pay the ransom.

457
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:08,000
'Cause most folks--

458
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,208
most folks
just don't appreciate
the work we cops do.

459
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,083
- Virginia.
- Hmm? What?

460
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:21,208
Willard, bring in
our guests some coffee.

461
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:24,417
Willard!

462
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:27,291
- Willard?
- What's that?

463
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,667
I don't know.

464
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:37,083
The cover page
is from Pick 'N Shop.

465
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,166
It's from the kidnappers.

466
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:46,000
"Miss Crock, bring the cash
to Three Rivers Stadium
at 10 p.m.

467
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,625
No cops
or the chauffeur dies."
No cops?

468
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:54,667
What if those bums
run off with my money?
Don't worry, ma'am.

469
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:59,792
That ballpark is so gigantic,
we're gonna be able to hide
a million cops in there.

470
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:01,667
I thought these guys
were smart,

471
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,125
but they're in
way  over their heads.

472
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:16,208
You think those cops
are gonna show up
at the stadium?

473
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:20,834
You kiddin' me, man?
It's gonna be like rush hour
at Dunkin' Donuts.

474
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:22,875
Yeah.

475
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:25,625
I'll be waiting for you
in the runway lounge.

476
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:28,375
- Don't forget.
The flight's at midnight.
- then, tomorrow,

477
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,291
we'll be lying
on the beach.

478
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:33,375
- Sipping margaritas.
- Smoking a fatty.

479
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:41,542
This is the most
distressful day
of my life.

480
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:44,250
Do we have to pay them
all the money?

481
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,500
I mean, couldn't we,
I don't know, sort of
shortchange them a little?

482
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Virginia,
bite the bullet.

483
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,333
I'm sure your tax men
will figure a way
to write it off.

484
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,083
Hmm.
That's a lot of green.

485
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:05,750
Jesus Christ,
what the hell is the wheel
doing on this side of the car?

486
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,750
God almighty.
I don't know how poor Willard
ever put up with this shit.

487
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,750
- Hello?
- This is the kidnapper.

488
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,583
- How did you get my number?
- Shut up. There's been
a change in plan.

489
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,583
Don't go to no stadium.

490
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,917
I gotta go to the stadium.

491
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:31,125
You're not gonna do nothing
until I tell you to,
you smelly old bitch.

492
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:35,083
Now listen.
You meet me
at midtown park.

493
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,333
That place isn't safe
after dark.

494
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:41,083
Oh, cork it.
I'll see you there
in ten minutes.

495
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:48,917
Quick, get me the police!

496
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:52,542
I'm still here!

497
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:56,792
Try any more games like that,
and I'll put a bullet
right through Willard's head.

498
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:29,458
Give me the money!

499
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:32,542
Oh, you're the kidnapper.

500
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,291
You no-good hooligan!

501
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:38,708
You decimate my house.

502
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:41,500
You violate
my public goodwill.

503
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,125
And why? Why me?
What did I ever do
to you?

504
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:50,208
- Gimme the money!
- You oughta be ashamed
of yourself.

505
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:54,166
Does your mother know
the kind of work that you do?

506
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:58,291
Don't you ever
stop talking?
Gimme the money!

507
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:03,208
Gimme the money.

508
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,625
Now I expect you
to return Willard...

509
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:08,625
in exactly
the same condition he was in.

510
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,583
He was a strong worker,

511
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,000
and he had good teeth.

512
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:16,875
I got the money!
I got the money!

513
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,291
Ha ha!
I gotta buy Hillary
a nice dinner.

514
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,375
Yeah, and I'm gonna buy
my mom a new headstone.

515
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,917
Yeah, one with her name
on it and everything!

516
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:27,166
I got the money!
Mister.

517
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:30,542
Hey, mister.
What's in the suitcase?

518
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,708
- Get away from me.
- Hey, mister.
What's in the suitcase?

519
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:36,041
- Hand it over.
- Get away from me,
you little shit.

520
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:39,041
- Mister,
what's in the suitcase?
- Show us some respect.

521
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:43,125
- What's in the suitcase?
- Hand it over.
I don't like your attitude.

522
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,542
Ah, take a hike.
Hey!

523
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:49,083
Ow, Jesus Christ!

524
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,917
Harder!

525
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:54,500
- Oh!
- Zap him!

526
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,250
Aah!

527
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,083
Oh.

528
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:09,375
You can't let 'em down now.
You can't let 'em down.

529
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,875
Yeah, let's see.

530
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:23,875
No.

531
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:43,917
Nah. That's no good.

532
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:58,083
Hmm. Oh.

533
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,959
Not bad.

534
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,959
Not bad.

535
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,667
Uh--

536
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,291
Don't pay any attention
to me.

537
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:20,041
I'm just gonna take
some work home.

538
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:23,500
I'm very conscientious.

539
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,125
I'll-- oh, boy.

540
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:31,041
I'll go get it.

541
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:41,125
Wake up.

542
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:44,208
Where am I?
What is this?
What's going on here?

543
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:48,542
The police found you
beat up in the park.

544
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,792
But, of course,
those incompetents...

545
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:53,959
let the kidnappers
get away with my money.

546
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:56,000
So, I was in the park,

547
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,166
and-- and they got away
with the five million--

548
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:03,875
You owe me,
and you're going
to work off that ransom...

549
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:08,875
until the day
Jesus calls you home.

550
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,542
Just the chunk light
in spring water,

551
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,667
not in olive oil,
and a Diet Coke.

552
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:20,542
Got it.
Oh, there you are,
as I live and breathe.

553
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:23,500
Pittsburgh's finest.
I'm truly sorry, ma'am.

554
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,750
But if it's any consolation,
we had every inch
of that stadium covered.

555
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,083
We had snipers.
Who-o-o cares?

556
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,542
Would you do me a favor?

557
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:42,625
Find... my... cash.

558
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,792
I gotta get outta here.

559
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,875
Aah!

560
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:03,959
Mr. Fillmore, I, uh,

561
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:06,083
I was wondering
if I could have
a few words with you.

562
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:09,917
Sure, of course.
How can I--
how can I help you?

563
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:14,625
I wonder, Mr. Fillmore--
Mr. Fillmore--

564
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:18,166
Mr. Fillmore,
I wonder if you would, uh,

565
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:20,458
give me a description
of the kidnappers?

566
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:25,625
The kidnappers.
Well, I-I never actually
saw the kidnappers that well...

567
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:29,291
because I was, uh,
I was kept blindfolded.

568
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:31,166
- Blindfolded.
- Uh-huh.

569
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:34,125
But you were not blindfolded
on the video.

570
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:36,125
No. No, I wasn't.

571
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,708
Uh, no, I wasn't blindfolded
on the video, you see,

572
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:42,792
but I didn't see
the kidnappers then either
because, uh, uh, uh,

573
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:47,208
they hired a TV crew
to shoot the video.

574
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:51,000
Yeah, yeah,
we did it in a vid--
in a studio with a crew.

575
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,125
You got any Nuprin?

576
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:04,834
No. Why?
What happened in there?

577
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:08,291
The bozo's covering
for the kidnappers.

578
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:10,500
I really gotta
get out of here.

579
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:18,708
Where do you think
you're going?
Rusty!

580
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,875
Yeah, Rusty.
Where you been?

581
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:23,125
Rusty, the drop-off
did not go as planned.

582
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,166
Yeah, I concur,
because the plan
never mentioned...

583
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:28,583
my best friend
two-timing me.
I didn't two-time you.

584
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:31,333
Come on, man.
"I'll do the drop
all by myself,

585
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,792
that way Rusty
won't get in trouble."

586
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:37,375
Where's the bag of money?
Why ain't you
at the airport?

587
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:41,333
- What are you doing
in a hospital, hmm?
- A street gang took the money.

588
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:44,041
Bullshit.
You're ripping me off.

589
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:48,083
I swear to God.
It was these big muscle men
in the park.

590
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,458
They-- they beat me up,
and they took
the five million bucks.

591
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:56,458
They had guns and tattoos
and-- and they had those
two sticks on a chain...

592
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,708
that you swing
and you hurt people with.

593
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,834
You expect me to believe
that you were mugged?

594
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:03,375
Mugged?
It was more like a rape.

595
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:08,959
Well, not a real rape.

596
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:12,125
Look, grand inquisitor,
if you had ripped me off,

597
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:15,667
would you barricade yourself
in a hospital room
with 20 cops outside?

598
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:18,792
You make
an interesting point.

599
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:21,708
It's not imaginable
that things could be
more botched.

600
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:25,542
Oh, yeah?
What about Grover?

601
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:30,250
Oh, no.
That fruitcake's gonna be
dumping my fake body.

602
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:35,000
Hello. County morgue.
Rita speaking.
Can I help you?

603
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,708
I'd like to speak
to a Grover Cleaver.

604
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,333
I'm sorry. Mr. Cleaver
no longer works here.

605
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:42,542
Bitch, what are you
talking about?

606
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,625
Mr. Cleaver
quit yesterday.

607
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:50,708
He said he was joining
the super rich.

608
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:52,083
Aah!

609
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,250
Grover retired
from the morgue.

610
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,750
Too wealthy
to hold a job.

611
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,750
Man, we are no good at this.
We gotta stop this guy.

612
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,750
How? We don't know
where to find him.

613
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,959
Call Hillary.
Hillary doesn't know him.

614
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:07,250
She knew his name
because he was in the army
with that fat dude...

615
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,250
who used to live
across the street
from her.

616
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,792
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
You're so defeatist.

617
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:15,542
Fine. I'll track him
down myself.

618
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:18,500
If you did it,
you'd probably
muck it up anyway.

619
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,667
The guy can't do
anything right. Oh!

620
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:27,583
Oh, d-detective.

621
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:31,041
Mr. Hayes,
what are you doing here?

622
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:34,000
Huh?
Well, I was, um,

623
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,542
I'm visiting--
I'm visiting my Aunt Mabel.

624
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:39,500
She's real--
she's real sick.

625
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,250
She got polio and emphysema.
All that shit together.

626
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,208
It's-- it's gonna kill her.
I swear.

627
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:49,083
She, uh, she's staying
in this room right here.
I'm gonna go say hi.

628
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:57,792
Aunt Mabel,
come give me
some sugar, girl.

629
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:03,875
I told you don't listen
to them doctors.
No!

630
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:06,959
Hey, Aunt Mabel!

631
00:46:06,959 --> 00:46:09,000
Okay, you're convulsing.
You gotta relax.

632
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,500
All right, Aunt Mabel!

633
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,041
I'm gonna let you
get some rest!
Get some rest, Aunt Mabel!

634
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,542
All right,
give Uncle Gordon my love.

635
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:25,291
Oh.

636
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:29,792
That medicine got Aunt Mabel
real irritable, man.
She's crazy.

637
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:32,333
She's normally
a real sweetheart.

638
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:34,166
Detective!

639
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,750
Detective,
you're not gonna believe
what's happened.

640
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,875
We've just discovered
a dead body.

641
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:45,041
Oh, shit.

642
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,542
They found the body!
They found the body!

643
00:46:53,542 --> 00:46:57,083
Oh, my Lord.
That dumb-ass Grover.

644
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,250
He's the only one of us
who follows directions.

645
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,375
We're going to jail.
We're going to jail.
We're gonna be somebody's bitch.

646
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:06,875
Maybe if we confess--
maybe if we confess,
they'll go easy on us.

647
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:10,208
Yeah. Yeah, maybe
we'll just get
community service.

648
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:13,291
Or maybe they'll take us
to one of those
country club prisons.

649
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:15,583
We'll talk stocks
with bankers.

650
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:19,458
- We could really make
some connections.
- You're insane.

651
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:21,583
We're gonna be
somebody's bitch.

652
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:29,500
Willard.

653
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,208
I have some shocking news.

654
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:34,917
They found
your kidnapper.
Oh!

655
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:39,041
You sure it was
the kidnapper?

656
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,000
Of course I'm sure.

657
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,417
They found his dead body
on the front steps
of the Quaker Wax Museum.

658
00:47:45,417 --> 00:47:48,125
He was wearing
all your clothes...

659
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:51,458
and those divine
cuff links I gave you.

660
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:55,375
Any idea why the kidnapper
would be wearing your clothes?

661
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,792
Huh?
Um, no.

662
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:03,041
Any idea why the kidnapper
would be dead?

663
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:06,750
W-well, that kidnapping den
was a real hothouse of emotion
you know.

664
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,291
Anything
could have happened.

665
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:13,792
Well, let's just hope
that body isn't so ripped up
that you can't identify it.

666
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Yep, that's the guy.
No question.
That's the kidnapper.

667
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,792
- That's the guy?
- Uh-huh.

668
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:29,834
That's the guy
who beat you up
and held you prisoner?

669
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:32,625
Uh, yeah, well, he was
a lot more ferocious...

670
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:35,417
back when he was,
uh, alive.

671
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:38,583
Ferocious?
He's an old midget.

672
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:42,166
Yeah, but he had
a real low voice.
You know, very intimidating.

673
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:44,875
Uh, uh,
"Put your hands
behind your head.

674
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:46,834
Get in the corner."
That's him.

675
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:51,125
That's him.
I'd recognize
that voice anywhere.

676
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:59,166
Okay. Okay.

677
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:03,583
Well, in some weird, screwy way
that I will never understand,

678
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,625
that is the kidnapper.

679
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,583
I'm telling you,
this whole thing stinks.

680
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,708
That Fillmore
and that Hayes,
they're connected.

681
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:11,583
Yeah, well, that midget
was no tough guy.

682
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:15,000
No shit, Sherlock.
They are definitely hiding
something or someone.

683
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,792
Detective?
Our 1-800 line
produced an eyewitness.

684
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:22,583
Meet Edgar Kettle.
He saw the drop.

685
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:27,000
Yeah, I saw
the whole thing.
The whole  thing.

686
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,750
Last night, I was in
my check-cashing store.

687
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:35,125
I look out, and I see a man
toss a body onto the steps.

688
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:38,375
- What kind of man?
- Oh, he was ugly.

689
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,333
Real ugly.

690
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:42,708
Get me the sketch artist
in here right now.

691
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:45,041
This case
is about to break.

692
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:48,667
#

693
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:58,542
That looks just like me.

694
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:02,500
"Wanted. Crock kidnapping."

695
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:16,625
Make this go away.

696
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:20,875
Make this go away.
Make this go away!

697
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,083
Oh!

698
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,125
I'm screwed!
I'm screwed!
I'm screwed!

699
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:55,375
Willard,
take away my salad plate.

700
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:59,625
I'm ready for
the second course!
Yeah.

701
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:02,917
"Stick with Miss Crock.
You'll get ahead."

702
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:16,667
Apologize to the man!
Apologize for what you did!

703
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:18,959
I'm sorry for misbehaving
in the park.

704
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:21,291
You better be!
This is the man
you wronged, Tito?

705
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,291
Now, give him back
what you took from him.
Here it is, mister.

706
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:28,792
- I didn't even open it.
- That's 'cause you couldn't,
liar!  It was locked!

707
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:32,166
Soon as I noticed the address
on the luggage tag,
we drove it straight over her.

708
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:34,792
Oh.
Uh, thanks.

709
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:37,667
Come on!
Your hide has an appointment
with my hand!

710
00:51:49,834 --> 00:51:52,667
Whoo! Yeah!
Let's party!

711
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,291
"Willard,
clear my salad plate!"

712
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,208
Yeah, well, lick me,
you old bag!

713
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:00,667
Your busboy's gone to Bermuda!

714
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:03,125
We're going to Bali,
so I can date her.

715
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:06,291
- Yeah!
- Get some Bali booty.

716
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,834
# I'm gonna get
some Bali booty #

717
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,542
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

718
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,291
Come on!
Come on!

719
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:22,125
Hey! You can't park there!
That's a tow-away zone!

720
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:26,000
We ain't never comin' back.
Go park it up your ass.

721
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:38,500
Whoo-hoo!

722
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,208
Excuse me.
We'd like two tickets to Bali.

723
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:47,208
First class.

724
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:51,041
- And how will you be
paying for that?
- Oh, that's a good question.

725
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:53,250
That hadn't really
occurred to us, really.
Well, I don't know.

726
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,125
How about this?
Cash!
Cash!

727
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,750
Uh-oh.
Oh.

728
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,625
- Don't worry, we got money.
- Back off there, lady.

729
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:12,083
There's no money!
Oh!

730
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:15,583
There's no money.
Miss Crock double-crossed us!
The old crow never paid!

731
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:17,583
She didn't care
if I lived or died!

732
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:19,834
She just ransomed me
with cabbage!

733
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:21,834
The white zone is for...

734
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:23,917
the immediate loading
and unloading of passengers.

735
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,083
I told you
not to park there.

736
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:38,208
She double-crossed us.
We'll triple-cross her.

737
00:53:38,208 --> 00:53:40,291
But this time,
we'll kidnap Miss Crock...

738
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:42,917
like I said we do
in the first place.

739
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:44,959
Nah, man, it's over.

740
00:53:56,792 --> 00:54:01,583
Hey, listen, sorry
I had to leave so, you know,
quickly the other day.

741
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03,875
That's all right, speedy.

742
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:06,708
I know you had a crime wave
to get to.

743
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:12,125
So what do you need tonight,
dynamite? Nitro?
A getaway driver, maybe?

744
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:15,834
No, no, no.
None of that.
Our gang's gone straight.

745
00:54:15,834 --> 00:54:20,458
All I need now is a--
a new life.

746
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:27,291
Willard, answer the door.

747
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:28,959
Willard!

748
00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:31,500
Oh, God.

749
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,291
Honest to God, he kills me.

750
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:36,500
His father never would have
goofed off like this.

751
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,458
He's never around when--
I'm coming!

752
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:46,166
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

753
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:48,917
This is who the hell I am!
Huh?

754
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:51,458
I'm wanted by every cop
in Pittsburgh!

755
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:55,000
I don't even know
what I did wrong!
Oh, my God.

756
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,959
You're the son of a bitch
who's got my money!

757
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:01,458
What money?
I never got no hundred grand.

758
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:03,875
A hundred grand, my ass!

759
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:07,041
- It was five million big ones!
- What are you, batty?

760
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:10,125
The deal was for
a hundred thou.
What deal?

761
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:12,834
You ripped me off!
Oh, yeah?

762
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,417
Good shot, huh?

763
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,834
Would you get the hell
out of my house?

764
00:55:21,834 --> 00:55:23,917
No!
Where's Willard?

765
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:26,333
No, no, no.
Wh-where's Willard?
Where is he?

766
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:29,208
You want Willard?
I'll get him. Please--
Don't-don't do that to me!

767
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:32,166
You think I'm stupid?
You think I'm stupid?
I'll get him! I'll get him!

768
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:35,208
You sons of bitches
ain't ripping me off no more!
Holy shit!

769
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:38,875
- Go on!
- Oh, my God!
Help me!

770
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:44,041
- Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
- Come here, sweetie pie!

771
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:46,667
- Oh, God!
- I got ya!

772
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:50,959
I got ya.
Watch your head.

773
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:56,417
Come on!

774
00:55:57,625 --> 00:56:00,792
Muffin!
Muffin, attack!

775
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:02,959
Muffin!

776
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:06,083
Nice doggie.

777
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,375
Please, attack!

778
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,750
Come on, lady!

779
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,125
Miss Crock,
I got news for you!

780
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:22,083
I'm quitting!

781
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:25,917
Miss Crock,
where are you?

782
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:29,458
Hey, Miss Crock!
I got some news
for you, whore!

783
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:32,542
I'm packing up and
moving out of this dump!

784
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:34,458
That's right, you heard me!

785
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,625
Good-bye, pie hag!

786
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,417
Where's she at?

787
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:54,542
Oh, my God.

788
00:56:54,542 --> 00:56:56,834
Grover stole my idea.

789
00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:59,959
Virginia! Where are you?
We're late.

790
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:02,834
Virginia,
the party starts at 9:00.
Are you ready?

791
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
Hey.

792
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,041
- What's going on here?
- W-w-w-we were just
turning down the sheets.

793
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:12,208
- Where's Miss Crock?
- Huh?

794
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:16,041
Who are you?
What's that note in your hand?

795
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:23,917
What'd you do that for?

796
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:26,250
I was scared.

797
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:30,500
- What do we do now?
- Run!

798
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:35,000
This is so bad!
Oh! Jesus forgive me!

799
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,041
Help. Police.

800
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:47,542
That stupid Grover!

801
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:49,792
What kind of kidnapper
uses his own stationery?

802
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:51,875
You know they're gonna
catch him.

803
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:55,083
And when they do,
he's gonna blab all about us!

804
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:02,834
Oh, my God!
They're hunting us down!

805
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:09,458
Stop! This is the police!

806
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:13,625
- No shit!
- Let's jump that fence!

807
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:17,542
I'm gettin' a charley horse!
I gotta start workin' out!

808
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,917
Freeze!
You're under arrest!

809
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:30,959
Details are sketchy,
but in a twist
stranger than bizarre,

810
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:33,917
Miss Virginia Crock herself
has been kidnapped.

811
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:36,000
Oh, my God.

812
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,208
Snowball, baby, let me in!

813
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,375
Open up!

814
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,875
Have you heard the news?
Yes, I know.
It's terrible.

815
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,917
Roger,
what are we gonna do?
I don't know.

816
00:58:51,917 --> 00:58:54,834
But this is not our fault.
You said it wouldn't
hurt anyone!

817
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:58,250
You said if we switched
the ransom money with cabbage,
nothing would happen.

818
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:02,083
The kidnappers would be stuck!
All I meant was they couldn't
complain to the police.

819
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:04,834
Yeah!
Now we've pissed them off!

820
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:07,834
You deserve that money.
She's been a figurehead
for years.

821
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:11,291
Oh, stop it!
You're the only one that's been
holding that bakery together.

822
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:13,250
I had to.
She's out of her mind.

823
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:19,083
Exactly.
So, why don't we just
let the kidnappers keep her?

824
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:24,375
Get me out of here!

825
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:27,667
I was framed!
I got a medical condition!

826
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:29,708
All right, Fillmore.
Time to talk.

827
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:31,917
My dick hurts!

828
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:40,792
I want the truth.
Now, what's your connection
to Rusty P. Hayes?

829
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:43,875
I've known Rusty my whole life.
Our mothers were in
church choir together.

830
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:47,291
I don't even know this
chauffeur guy, all right?

831
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:50,333
The first time I seen him
was in my restaurant
two weeks ago.

832
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:53,291
Last night, like every week,
I called up Rusty...

833
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:55,667
and I told him to come over and
watch Monday Night Football.

834
00:59:55,667 --> 00:59:57,792
Last night was Thursday.

835
00:59:57,792 --> 01:00:02,583
Oh.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.
It wasn't Monday Night Football.
It was Oprah.

836
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:05,542
Last night, I get this call
to make a delivery...

837
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:07,667
to this Wilbur guy.

838
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:10,417
- So--
- You mean Willard.

839
01:00:10,417 --> 01:00:12,875
Yeah, right, right.
Willard.

840
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:17,917
So anyway,
I drive up to this mansion
in my chicken delivery truck.

841
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:22,291
You know your truck
was impounded at the airport
earlier that day?

842
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:24,250
It was?

843
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,917
Oh, yeah, right, right.
No, I was on foot.

844
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:31,542
Anyways, the doorbell rings,
and it's the kidnappers!

845
01:00:31,542 --> 01:00:35,041
So, so, uh,
they started chasing us.

846
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:37,542
And then Miss Crock,
I remember she showed up.

847
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:41,500
She ran in, and she'd
just been-- just been taking
a bath, so she was nude.

848
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,041
Of course, naturally,
this upset everybody.

849
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:46,500
Gunshots started goin' off, man.

850
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,125
The windows was explodin'.
I heard screamin'.

851
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,834
So I run to my truck
as fast as I can.

852
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:56,083
I mean, I run away...
because I was scared.

853
01:00:56,083 --> 01:01:01,333
Chip Oswald says you hit him
over the head with a desk lamp.

854
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:03,291
Huh?

855
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:05,583
No, no, he's mistaken.

856
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:07,542
He's mistaken.
That-that was not me.

857
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:11,667
So Rusty's got this desk lamp,
and he's beating the hell
out of Chip.

858
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:14,500
And, uh, he's pounding him
and pounding him.

859
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,083
So I say, I say,

860
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:21,125
"Rusty, that's not
the kidnappers.
That's Chip!"

861
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:24,542
That's when the cops showed up
and they distracted everybody,

862
01:01:24,542 --> 01:01:27,583
and, uh,
the kidnappers got away.

863
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,083
One final question.

864
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:34,542
Let's forget
all this other crap.

865
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:37,250
Where is Miss Crock?

866
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,917
- I don't know.
- Who is Miss Crock?

867
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:46,750
Come on. Open your mouth.

868
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,708
Come on.
You want some food, Blackie?

869
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,708
Come on. Eat some dinner.
Yum, yum, yum.

870
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:53,125
Come on. Eat it, Blackie.
It's good. Look.

871
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:58,500
Come on, Blackie.
His name is Muffin.
It is not Blackie.

872
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,959
Hey, shut up!

873
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,208
The dog's name
is whatever I say it is...

874
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:05,458
until somebody takes you
off my hands.

875
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:08,625
The sooner the better, poopy.
The sooner the better!

876
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,000
Yeah, go on.
Yeah, go on.

877
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,417
Help!

878
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:16,625
#

879
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:19,500
That's my favorite TV program.
We're gonna watch it, Blackie.

880
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,000
This is it.
Ooh, look at that.
Look at that.

881
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,667
See that?  Hmm?
Hawaii Five-0.

882
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:29,000
What do we got, Danno?
Klaus Marburg.
West German passport.

883
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,125
How bad?
How bad?

884
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:33,125
Pretty bad.
Went right through him.
Any witnesses?

885
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:35,667
Any witnesses?
Yeah, lots of them.

886
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:38,500
- Only one shot?
- Only one shot?
- Just one.

887
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:42,834
He was hit just after
he stepped off the ramp.

888
01:02:42,834 --> 01:02:46,834
Steve, take a look.
Finished.

889
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:50,458
What is your obsession
with that guy?

890
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:53,083
Hey!
It's Jack Lord!

891
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:56,250
I'm the vice president
of his national fan club.

892
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,125
Clam up, will ya?

893
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,792
Hey, what are you, crazy?

894
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,667
The show's not over yet.

895
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:13,291
Give me that.

896
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,041
- Excuse me. May I have
your attention, please?
- Oh, my God.

897
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:20,708
I am pleased to announce that
Miss Crock's bakery...

898
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:23,166
is now merging with
Copenhagen Snak Food.

899
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:26,375
What the hell
are you talking about?
Additionally,

900
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:30,208
in accordance with Miss Crock's
established policy
regarding kidnapping,

901
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:33,291
we will not pay the ransom.

902
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:37,250
I know Miss Crock
will be proud of us
standing behind her like this.

903
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:40,667
Hey, wait a minute.
I'm gonna get screwed
on this deal.

904
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:45,500
That's two dozen anthuriums.

905
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:54,708
What?

906
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:58,291
What did I do?
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

907
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:02,291
I swear I'm innocent!
No! No, please! Don't!

908
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:06,417
Who's the crybaby?
We just busted the guy.

909
01:04:06,417 --> 01:04:09,458
He was trying
to pass the marked bills
from the Fillmore kidnapping.

910
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:11,750
Well, what do you know?

911
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,750
The brains
behind the operation.

912
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,834
Hey, get me
Fillmore and Hayes!

913
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:19,708
Whatever you do, don't
tell them about Grover.
Why not?

914
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:22,917
Because things are bad enough
without us getting blamed
for killing that old midget...

915
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:25,875
at the wax museum.

916
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:28,458
Maybe we should just
tell them the truth.
Yeah, right.

917
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:31,708
Like they're gonna believe
this all started 'cause
we kidnapped Muffin's turd.

918
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:35,917
There you are.
Get in here!
Sit down!

919
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,834
All right, the days
of dicking Dewey are over.

920
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:47,959
We found the kidnapper.
Your partner extraordinaire
is in our custody.

921
01:04:47,959 --> 01:04:50,500
So tell me all about Roger.

922
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:53,917
Who?

923
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:55,792
Oh, no.

924
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:58,083
You can't play
those games anymore.

925
01:04:58,083 --> 01:05:01,917
We nailed him with
marked bills.
All that
five million
was traceable.

926
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:04,125
What five million?
Miss Crock never paid.

927
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:09,291
What do you mean,
she never paid?

928
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:13,625
Uh-- uh--
I-I-I don't know.

929
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:16,291
You just said
Miss Crock never paid.

930
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,166
What do you mean,
she never paid?
What do you mean?

931
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:20,291
- I didn't say that.
- You did say that.
I just heard you say that.

932
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:23,000
You said that.
You said
Miss Crock never paid.
I didn't!

933
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,667
- I wanna know
what you meant by that.
- I don't know.

934
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:30,166
What did you mean by that?
What did you mean,
Miss Crock never paid?

935
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:32,333
What did you mean by that?
What did you mean by that?
What did he mean by that?

936
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:41,166
What the hell are you doing?
That man's a cop!

937
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:43,125
I was scared.

938
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:47,000
Every time you're scared,
you hit a guy
with a desk lamp!

939
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,542
I'm gettin' out of here.

940
01:05:57,792 --> 01:06:01,083
Who gave you
the marked money?
I don't know!

941
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:03,917
It was change
in a restaurant.

942
01:06:03,917 --> 01:06:08,917
If you don't tell us,
you're spending three years
in hard labor.

943
01:06:08,917 --> 01:06:10,834
It was Chip Oswald.

944
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:13,500
Hey!

945
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:19,500
Come on!

946
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:31,500
Willard, this is a cop car.
Should we really be taking
a cop car?

947
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:34,542
I'm gonna kill you!

948
01:06:34,542 --> 01:06:38,375
Put your ass to the gas!
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

949
01:06:41,542 --> 01:06:44,583
Where are we goin'?
I don't know!

950
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:52,667
Oh, shit. We're not
making things any better.

951
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:55,458
We gotta find
Miss Crock and Grover
and clear this whole thing up.

952
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:58,083
How are we gonna do that, man?
We don't know nothin'
about the guy.

953
01:06:58,083 --> 01:07:01,667
We don't know where he lives,
how to reach him.
He's a complete mystery.

954
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:04,417
Hold on.
I got an idea.

955
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,708
Directory assistance.
What city, please?

956
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:11,583
Pittsburgh.
Grover Cleaver.

957
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:14,000
Is that a business
or residence?
Uh, residence.

958
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,917
Is that Kleaver with a "K"?

959
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:20,083
No, with a "C,"
like cupcake.

960
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:22,458
Thank you.
Press 1 to be connected.

961
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:25,417
Got it.

962
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,708
#

963
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:31,875
Aloha. You've reached
the Jack Lord fan club.

964
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:35,625
- I got the Jack Lord fan club.
- The who?
- For membership, send $25...

965
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:37,834
to the Jack Lord fan club.

966
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:40,625
Attention: Grover Cleaver.
Wait!
It's Grover!

967
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:42,583
He lives at
910 Mabley Terrace.

968
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:46,000
Mabley Terrace?
That's a shitty neighborhood.

969
01:07:51,542 --> 01:07:53,959
Damn it!
Turn around!

970
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:05,917
Hey, we got away!

971
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:12,625
As you can see
from our skycam,

972
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:14,959
they are traveling in
a stolen police car.

973
01:08:14,959 --> 01:08:17,375
Again, to recap for
those viewers just tuning in,

974
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:21,917
less than 15 minutes ago
the two key suspects
in the Crock kidnapping...

975
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:24,083
escaped from
a downtown police station.

976
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:26,500
We'll stay with this story
until its conclusion.

977
01:08:29,667 --> 01:08:33,500
#

978
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,667
Hi!

979
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:39,000
Here we go.
I got it all.

980
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:42,291
Here it is.

981
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:45,792
One box of Fixodent.

982
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:51,041
One bag of prunes
for the old chute.

983
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:56,375
And four pounds
of lamb and rice...

984
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:58,208
dog chow!

985
01:08:58,208 --> 01:09:01,208
- That's for you.
- Where's my Bengay?

986
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:05,708
You forgot my Bengay,
didn't you? You know
my muscles get sore!

987
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:09,667
"You know how sore
my muscles get."
Zip it, you nag!

988
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:12,500
I wish I never met
that dang chauffeur.

989
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,708
Come on.

990
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:18,708
The first rule of life,
Blackie:
never do no favors.

991
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:21,000
You call kidnapping a man
doing him a favor?

992
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:25,333
I didn't kidnap that guy.
He kidnapped himself.

993
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:28,834
What did you say?

994
01:09:28,834 --> 01:09:32,083
Hmm?
Uh-oh.

995
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,708
You ain't gonna
take me alive!

996
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,750
Grover!

997
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:01,458
Jesus Christ!
Why is he shootin' at us?

998
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,583
He thinks we're the police!

999
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:09,834
Grover, we are not the police!
We are not the police!

1000
01:10:09,834 --> 01:10:13,959
Oh, yeah! Tryin'
to fool stupid Grover, huh?

1001
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:16,500
I'll show ya!

1002
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:23,583
Grover!
Grover, it's us!

1003
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:26,125
Don't shoot!

1004
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:28,542
Oh, it's you guys.
Come on up!

1005
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:31,125
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

1006
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,667
Any word yet on that car?
Yeah, it's been spotted
on Mabley Terrace.

1007
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:39,583
Mabley Terrace?
Ah, Jesus.

1008
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:41,917
I'm gonna need some backup.
Let's go!

1009
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:45,291
Grover, you have to let
Miss Crock go, man!
Grover!

1010
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:47,542
Too much shit's goin' on.
No way!

1011
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:50,208
I'm out 18 bucks
for groceries.
What?

1012
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,834
All right. Look,
here's a twenty, all right?
Yeah!

1013
01:10:52,834 --> 01:10:56,041
I can't break no twenty.
Keep the change!

1014
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:58,125
All right.

1015
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:04,208
- Miss Crock,
we're here to rescue you.
- How dare you kidnap yourself!

1016
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,250
Oh!

1017
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,208
You tried to swindle me?

1018
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,834
I am going
to have your ass!

1019
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:15,333
- Miss Crock, I'm sorry.
- What nerve!

1020
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:17,333
After all I've done
for you.

1021
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:22,125
I was under a lot of pressure,
and-and I--

1022
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:25,458
After all you've done for me?

1023
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:29,625
Oh! Oh!

1024
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:33,917
Willard Fillmore,
the building is surrounded!

1025
01:11:33,917 --> 01:11:36,959
What exactly, Miss Crock,
did you ever do for me?

1026
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,542
I've been your slave
for 15 years!
I worked my butt off!

1027
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:44,583
And then when I got kidnapped,
you wouldn't even pay
the ransom money!

1028
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:46,792
Well, after all, you--

1029
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:49,208
you were just
a hired servant.

1030
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:51,083
Hired--

1031
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:54,750
Well, does a hired servant
watch TV with you
when you're lonely?

1032
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,875
Does a hired servant
read to you that time
you broke your glasses?

1033
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:03,291
Does a hired servant
visit you in the hospital
when nobody else does?

1034
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:06,166
I did everything
my father would've.

1035
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:11,250
Mmm--
not everything.

1036
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,291
Hmm?

1037
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:18,750
Your father was, uh,
a very special man.

1038
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:22,750
He provided...
extra services.

1039
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:27,417
Oh, my God.

1040
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:31,208
Your dad didn't say,
"Stick with Miss Crock.
You'll get ahead."

1041
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:33,875
He said,
"stick with Miss Crock
and you'll get head."

1042
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:38,041
Would you butt out?
We're talking here!

1043
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:40,333
Yuck! Oh!

1044
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:43,625
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move, move!

1045
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:50,083
Can you see them?
I think they're on
the third floor.

1046
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:51,959
Oh, man!

1047
01:12:51,959 --> 01:12:54,375
That's why I couldn't
compare to my dad?

1048
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:56,208
Oh, now, now, now.
Don't be silly.

1049
01:12:56,208 --> 01:13:00,625
It's just that your father
was... very gifted.
Oh!

1050
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:03,917
- That's some big shoes
to fill.
- I don't wanna hear this!

1051
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:07,417
Man, you must've been
a total letdown.

1052
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:09,667
No wonder she ransomed you
with an empty suitcase.

1053
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:12,000
That suitcase wasn't empty.

1054
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:15,083
I paid every cent.

1055
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:18,291
Oh, yeah?
Then why do Roger and Chip
have the money?

1056
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:20,625
Roger and Chip?

1057
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:23,125
Wait!

1058
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:26,792
Stop! Don't shoot!
They're stupid and confused!

1059
01:13:26,792 --> 01:13:29,291
Position! Move out!

1060
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:32,542
- I'm goin' in.
- Come on!  Come on!

1061
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,792
I can't believe it.

1062
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:39,792
I can't believe
Chip shafted me.

1063
01:13:39,792 --> 01:13:43,000
I can't believe
you came through.

1064
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,083
Beaver team, move in!
Go, go, go, go!

1065
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:49,875
Ooh! It's like
an army out there.

1066
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:54,834
I'm on parole for mail fraud.
I gotta hide.

1067
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:02,708
Grover!
How'd you get in there, man?

1068
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:04,834
I mean,
Come on, Grover!

1069
01:14:04,834 --> 01:14:09,708
I-I-I took care of
all of Chip's gambling debts.

1070
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,583
Grover!

1071
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,500
I-I-I paid for all
his methadone treatments.

1072
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,500
I guess we both
got the big screw.

1073
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:21,667
Come on, Grover!

1074
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:25,667
Don't move!
Hayes and Fillmore,

1075
01:14:25,667 --> 01:14:29,333
you're under arrest again
for the abduction
of Virginia Crock!

1076
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:31,750
And this time,
it's gonna stick!

1077
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:36,500
You clod.

1078
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,542
They didn't kidnap me.

1079
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:42,083
They rescued me.

1080
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:46,708
If Willard hadn't shown up,
I'd be dead and buried
in this hellhole!

1081
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:50,417
I don't understand.
Then who's the kidnapper?

1082
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,708
#

1083
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:58,458
First, I wanna upgrade
the assembly line.

1084
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:01,417
Toss out mincemeat.
Ooh.
Ooh.

1085
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:03,375
Bring in vanilla custard.

1086
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:05,375
Ahh!
Ahh!

1087
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,625
Then I'm gonna mix strawberry
into the rhubarb.

1088
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:10,500
Muffin?

1089
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,375
Freeze!
You're under arrest.

1090
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:17,291
Chip Oswald,

1091
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:21,667
you are hereby apprehended
for the kidnappings of Willard
Fillmore and Virginia Crock.

1092
01:15:21,667 --> 01:15:25,417
That is ridiculous!
How dare you!

1093
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:28,583
I demand you leave my house!

1094
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,667
Put on your pants.
You're goin' to jail.

1095
01:15:36,667 --> 01:15:38,917
All right, let's keep
them hands behind your back.

1096
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,250
Oh, my God!
It's the new Village People.

1097
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,125
You're all crazy!

1098
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:48,125
- Put down that gun!
- I'm not goin' back to prison!

1099
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:50,792
What do you mean "back"?
Up yours!

1100
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:55,291
I've got nothing from all
of those years of suffering,
working for you!

1101
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:57,417
- Chip, nobody  does.
- Stay out of this!

1102
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:01,291
I'll see you all in hell!

1103
01:16:01,291 --> 01:16:04,875
I'll slice you
and I'll dice you...

1104
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:07,917
and I'll bake you all
into meat pies!

1105
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:18,291
Well, it's an ugly ending,
but the case is solved.

1106
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:21,500
I knew he was the kidnapper
the whole time.

1107
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,625
Never trust a black man
named Chip.

1108
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:34,291
This is so beautiful.

1109
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:37,708
I can spend
the rest of my life here.
Yeah.

1110
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:40,625
And we found a place where
almost everyone speaks English.

1111
01:16:51,959 --> 01:16:54,625
Oh, there's my juicy,
succulent chicken.
Come here.

1112
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:58,333
- How's business, baby?
- Great, Rusty.

1113
01:16:58,333 --> 01:17:00,500
You guys got a package.
Huh? Oh.

1114
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,166
Oh! Hey.
Look.

1115
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:06,166
It's from Miss Crock.

1116
01:17:06,166 --> 01:17:09,458
What did she send?

1117
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:14,166
Wow! Check it out.
It's an Armani suit.

1118
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:16,333
And there's a letter.

1119
01:17:19,792 --> 01:17:20,917
Dear Willard,

1120
01:17:20,917 --> 01:17:24,125
I hope you're enjoying
your retirement money.

1121
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:28,708
Here's a suit you can wear
when you graduate from USC.

1122
01:17:28,708 --> 01:17:32,583
Back in Pittsburgh, I decided
not to sell the company.

1123
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:37,208
And I have a new man
in my life.

1124
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:39,667
Grover's quite special.

1125
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:43,834
He's a little slow,
but he does what he's told.

1126
01:17:43,834 --> 01:17:47,875
So, thanks again
for introducing us.

1127
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,917
Your everlasting friend,
Virginia.

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,350
Stand still. Eyes to the floor.

3
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,480
Walk on.

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,400
Address him as 'Captain!'

6
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,350
Enter.

7
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,810
Sit down.

8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,690
Hands under your thighs, palms down.

9
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,690
What do you have to tell us?

10
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,480
I've done nothing.

11
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,230
I know nothing.

12
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,270
You've done nothing, know nothing...

13
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,480
You think we imprison people on a whim?

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,440
No...

15
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,020
If you think our humanistic system
capable of such a thing,

16
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,310
that alone would justify your arrest.

17
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,730
We'd like to jog your memory, prisoner no. 227.

18
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,400
On September 28th, Dieter Pirmasens,

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,100
your friend and neighbor, fled to the West.

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,020
We believe that he had help.

21
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,600
I know nothing.

22
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,730
He didn't even tell me he wanted to leave.

23
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,770
I first heard about it at work.

24
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,480
Please recount what you did on September 28th.

25
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,770
- It's in my statement.
- Tell me again.

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,270
I was at Treptow Park memorial with my children.

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,270
Where I met my old friend Max Kirchner.

28
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,310
We went to his place
and listened to music until late.

29
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,270
He has a telephone,
you can call him to confirm this.

30
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,690
I can give you the number.

31
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,600
The enemies of our state are arrogant.

32
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,600
Remember that.

33
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,400
It takes patience. About 40 hours worth.
(STASI COLLEGE, POTSDAM-EICHE)

34
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,980
Fast forward...

35
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,480
I want to sleep.

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,940
Please, let me sleep!

37
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,520
Hands under your thighs.

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,770
Tell me again
what you did on September 28th.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,060
Please, just one hour,
just a little... a little sleep.

40
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,310
Tell me again what you did on that day.

41
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,520
Why keep him awake for so long?

42
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,520
It's... inhuman.

43
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,690
An innocent prisoner
will become more angry by the hour,

44
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,810
due to the injustice suffered.

45
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,560
He will shout and rage.

46
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,350
A guilty prisoner
becomes more calm and quiet...

47
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,230
Or he cries.

48
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,770
He knows he's there for a reason.

49
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,150
The best way to establish guilt or innocence

50
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,020
is non-stop interrogation.

51
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,600
...school friend Max Kirchner.

52
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,020
We went to his place...

53
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,350
and listened to music until late.

54
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,350
He has a telephone,
you can call him to confirm this.

55
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,400
Do you notice anything about his statement?

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
It's the same as at the beginning.

57
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,560
Exactly the same. Word for word.

58
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,940
People who tell the truth
can re-formulate things,

59
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,100
and they do.

60
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,150
A liar has prepared sentences,
which he falls back on

61
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,690
when under pressure.

62
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,060
227 is lying.

63
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,230
We have two important indicators,
and can increase the intensity.

64
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,600
If you don't give names,

65
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,850
We'll have to arrest your wife.

66
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,810
Jan and Nadja
will be put into state care.

67
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,600
Is that what you want?

68
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,900
Who was the person who helped him flee?

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,730
- Glaske...
- Again! Speak clearly!

70
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,020
Glaske... Werner Glaske.

71
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,190
Werner... Glaske.

72
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,350
Quiet!

73
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,980
Quiet!

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,770
Listen!

75
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,650
Does anyone know what that is?

76
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,230
It's the odor sample for the dogs.

77
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,190
It must be collected at every
interrogation. Never forget it!

78
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,980
Your subjects are enemies of Socialism.

79
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,850
Never forget that! Goodbye.

80
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,730
That was good, really good.

81
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,390
You remember

82
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,850
how we sat there 20 years ago?

83
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,890
They've offered me a professorship.

84
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,020
Life's not about good grades, though
mine weren't that bad, thanks to you.

85
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,980
So what's up?

86
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,100
Why do you always think I'm scheming?

87
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,480
- I wanted to invite you to the theater.
- The theater?

88
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,230
I heard that Minister Hempf is going.

89
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,270
As head of the Culture Department,
I should show my face.

90
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,230
It starts at 7 p.m. We should get going.

91
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,270
THE LIVES OF OTHERS

92
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,600
Minister Hempf at one o'clock.

93
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,560
He used to be in State Security, you know.

94
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,730
He really cleaned up the theater scene.

95
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,060
Georg Dreyman, the writer.

96
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,980
An arrogant type, the kind I warn my students about.

97
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,640
But he's loyal.

98
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,140
If they were all like him, I'd be out of a job.

99
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,310
He's our only non-subversive writer
who is also read in the West.

100
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,310
He thinks the GDR is the greatest country on earth.

101
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,350
It starts.

102
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,770
What's wrong, my child? A new vision?

103
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,560
Speak, Marta! Speak!

104
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,890
Your Arthur...

105
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,350
is dead.

106
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,810
Arthur? Can't you be wrong, just this once?

107
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,890
No, sister. Believe me.

108
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,600
He fell to his death.

109
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,730
Crushed by the mighty wheel.

110
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,850
I see it,

111
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
though I'd rather see any other horror.

112
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,890
Why am I not spared these visions?

113
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,480
Elena! Go home... and mourn.
I'll finish your shift.

114
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,480
Did you like it? Dreyman's good, eh?

115
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,440
I'd have him monitored.

116
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,730
Monitored? All that teaching
is ruining your instincts.

117
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,020
I could oversee it myself.

118
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,020
He's clean, I tell you. Even Hempf likes him.

119
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,730
We'd be shooting ourselves in the foot.

120
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,060
I'm going down.

121
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,560
"Faces of Love"

122
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,600
I hear a lot about your work.

123
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,810
They say culture's in good hands.

124
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,690
Your name is mentioned in Party circles.

125
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,230
We're the Party's 'shield and sword'.

126
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,390
I'm aware of that at all times.

127
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,230
What do you make of him?

128
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,640
Of Georg Dreyman?

129
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,940
Maybe...

130
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,390
Maybe what?

131
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,560
Maybe he's not as clean as he seems.

132
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,390
Grubitz! That's why you and I are on top.

133
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,310
Your average Stasi chump would have said,

134
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,520
"One of our best! So loyal!" etc.

135
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
But we can see more.

136
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,520
You're heading to the very top, Grubitz.

137
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,140
There's something fishy about him.

138
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,480
I can feel it in my gut.

139
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,100
Dreyman's having a party next week.

140
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,350
Some dubious types are going, Hauser and that rabble.

141
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,390
Try to wire the place discreetly by then.

142
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,770
Measures A and B.

143
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,140
Only in his rooms. Nothing conspicuous.

144
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,690
He has powerful friends.

145
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,520
No one is to know about this

146
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,810
until we've found something.

147
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,770
But if you get something on him,

148
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,730
you'll have a good friend in the Central Committee.

149
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,730
You understand what I'm saying?

150
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,480
Have a nice evening, Comrade Minister.

151
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,850
Why is he staring at us?

152
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,060
What's he doing here, anyway?

153
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,190
I think he's got a crush on you.

154
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,310
I can't let the evening pass
without raising a toast to our artists.

155
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,520
A great Socialist,
I can't recall who it was, once said:

156
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,440
Writers are engineers of the soul.

157
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,940
So Georg Dreyman is

158
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,520
one of our country's greatest engineers.

159
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,770
- What charming bed-fellows you have.
- Paul!

160
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,600
And to Christa-Maria Sieland,

161
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,480
the loveliest pearl of the GDR.

162
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,810
I believe that
nobody contradict my opinion.

163
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,520
Let's raise our glasses

164
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,690
to Christa-Maria Sieland:
Three cheers to her.

165
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,350
Someone like him doesn't even deserve
to address you.

166
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,980
Stay with me!

167
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,940
And now something for the soul...

168
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,440
May I?

169
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,350
- How did you like my speech?
- Many thanks.

170
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,890
I liked your play too.

171
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,560
Really, it was good.

172
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,560
"Engineers of the soul."
That was a Stalin quote.

173
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,850
Really?

174
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,310
I, too, like to provoke, Mr. Hauser.

175
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,060
But unlike you, I know how far I can go.

176
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,060
I'm more like our dear Dreyman.

177
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,390
He knows that the Party needs artists,

178
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,440
but that artists need the Party even more.

179
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,940
If you're going to talk politics,
I'll find another dance partner.

180
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,850
- I'm willing.
- Too late!

181
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,980
I follow our theater with interest.

182
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,060
It used to be theater people...

183
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,100
- Paul!
- It's okay,

184
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,060
I've known Mr. Hauser for years.

185
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,310
Comrade Schwalber!

186
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,440
You did a good job tonight too.

187
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,560
Dreyman, I'm glad you're working
with such directors.

188
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,480
It wasn't always so.

189
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,020
You're referring to Jerska?

190
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,310
I think you judged him too harshly.

191
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,190
Sure, he went too far in what he said.
Without a doubt.

192
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,140
But

193
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,310
put yourself in his shoes for a moment.
You, as a man of honor.

194
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,270
He can't remove his name
from that statement.

195
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,770
He could work for any theater in the West.

196
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,600
But he wants to stay here.

197
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,940
Because he believes in Socialism
and in this country.

198
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,730
- His black-listing is...
- Black-listing?

199
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:39,940
We don't do that here!
You should choose your words more carefully.

200
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,980
Comrade Hempf, just between us:

201
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,390
My plays are not strong enough

202
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,020
to survive Schwalber's direction.

203
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,850
I need Jerska,

204
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,890
and I think you judged him too harshly.

205
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,690
Well, I don't.

206
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,190
But that's what we all love about your plays.

207
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,440
Your love for mankind...

208
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,350
your belief that people can change.

209
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,310
Dreyman,

210
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,480
no matter how often you say it in your plays,

211
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,350
people do not change!

212
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,600
How is he, by the way?

213
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,060
He hopes that his black- ...

214
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,940
that he can work again soon.

215
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,270
Is he right in hoping?

216
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,520
Of course he is.
As long as he lives, and even longer.

217
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,390
Because as you know, Dreyman,
hope always dies last.

218
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,560
The team will be ready
to wire the place as of tomorrow.

219
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,100
It needs to be finished by Thursday.

220
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,560
You should plan everything carefully.

221
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,810
Think you can do it?

222
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,810
Good night.

223
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,560
I'll get in trouble if I don't go.

224
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,140
- With who?
- My girlfriend.

225
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,890
Twenty minutes.

226
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,980
Yes?

227
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,230
Frau Meineke... One word of this to anyone,

228
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,350
and Masha loses her spot at the university.

229
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,770
Is that understood?

230
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,770
Yes.

231
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,640
Send Mrs. Meineke a gift for her cooperation.

232
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,810
It must be Thursday again.

233
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,680
Time passes so quickly...
Perhaps that's a good thing.

234
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,520
- How are you?
- Not bad.

235
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,180
It's not always this noisy.

236
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,560
Only on Thursdays, I know.

237
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,180
Yes.

238
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,850
We missed you at the premiere.

239
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,600
Did Schwalber do a good job?

240
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,390
His good bits were stolen from you.

241
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,890
That keeps my ideas alive.

242
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,600
Don't bear it.

243
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,100
I can't bear those fat, dressed-up people

244
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,140
at premieres anymore.

245
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,270
Doesn't sound like me, does it?

246
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,680
But maybe this is the real me,

247
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,850
not the old Jerska.

248
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,890
He was friendly and caring, nourished by success...

249
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,140
all thanks to the grace of the bigwigs.

250
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
But I won't complain much longer.

251
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,020
In my next life, I'll simply be an author.

252
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,980
A happy author
who can write whenever he wants.

253
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,560
Like you.

254
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,270
What is a director if he can't direct?

255
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,480
He's a projectionist without a film,

256
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,390
a miller without corn. He is nothing.

257
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,730
Nothing at all.

258
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,310
Albert, the Minister was at the premiere.
Minister Hempf.

259
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,770
I spoke to him about your blacklisting.

260
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,060
It looks promising.

261
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,770
He gave me hope, concrete hope. Literally.

262
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,730
Really?

263
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,680
That's great.

264
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,930
Cheap Georgian wine. Chateau Jerska.

265
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,890
So is our holy drinker coming?

266
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,310
I forgot to ask him.

267
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,980
You're strong and forceful.
That's how I need you.

268
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,810
Don't let this blackness into your life.

269
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,060
- Albert is my friend.
- And you're my boyfriend.

270
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,350
Looks like a 50th.

271
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,180
But I'm going to be 40, right?

272
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:17,770
Don't forget, you promised
to wear a tie for your birthday.

273
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,430
I would, but I don't have one.

274
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,310
Bon anniversaire!

275
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,350
Atie?

276
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,180
You said you didn't want any books.

277
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,980
Or can't you tie a tie,

278
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,230
you old working-class poet?

279
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,730
What?

280
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,100
I was born wearing a tie!

281
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,480
I had to "fight my way out

282
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,230
of my middle-class fetters".

283
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,310
Then put those fetters on again, just for me.

284
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,270
Alright... It's no

285
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,350
big deal to tie a tie.

286
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,730
Frau Meineke, would you come in for a moment!

287
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,100
Can you tie a tie?

288
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,180
You've no idea how thankful I am.

289
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,770
- Are you feeling unwell?
- No... I'm feeling fine.

290
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,560
Finished?

291
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,100
Wonderful. It's perfect.
It couldn't be better.

292
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,140
It'll be our secret.
You can keep a secret, right?

293
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,060
Of course.

294
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,390
I'll be damned! And I thought you couldn't do it.

295
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,390
You don't normally hide your talents.

296
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,270
You've no idea of the things I can do!

297
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,680
The first guest.

298
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,230
Our dear neighbors locked the main door again.

299
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,270
- Can you go?
- Yes, I'm going.

300
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,850
Maestro! Our humble offerings.

301
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,770
- I expressly said no books!
- But thanks.

302
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,600
Would you like a drink?

303
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
- A soda.
- Vodka for me.

304
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,600
I'll get it.

305
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,480
Why the hell's Albert sitting all alone?

306
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,810
He won't talk to us.
He sent us all away.

307
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,890
I brought you something too.

308
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,890
- Did you really come here to read?
- It is Brecht!

309
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,640
I feel like a fraud among these people.

310
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,640
A fraud?

311
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,810
Come off it, Albert!
You're losing your grip on reality.

312
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,560
You know how we admire you,

313
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,430
how everybody admires you.

314
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,560
For something I did 10 years ago...

315
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,930
and could probably never do again.

316
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,560
My favorite director! Wait!

317
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,140
I need to talk to you a moment.

318
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,270
Tell me again how you got into this position.

319
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,890
Pure talent.

320
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,770
Of course!

321
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,890
But what else did you have to do?

322
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,270
Everyone knows you're with the Stasi!

323
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,810
- What an outrageous insinuation!
- Don't forget it!

324
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,640
- Paul!
- What?

325
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,230
Excuse my friend, he's had too much to drink.

326
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,310
But you know he's with the Stasi!

327
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,020
No, Paul. I don't know that.

328
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:46,770
You're such an idealist
that you're almost a bigwig.

329
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,980
It was informers and conformists
like that who ruined Albert.

330
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,140
Spy, betrayer!

331
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,890
If you don't take a stand, you're not human!

332
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,230
If you ever want to take action, call.

333
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,140
If not, we don't have to meet again.

334
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,890
Your friends don't have much taste.

335
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,020
That's really unfair.

336
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:40,230
Here! Look at this beautiful backscratcher.

337
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,930
That's a salad fork!

338
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,430
Still, it's beautiful... And look at this.

339
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,810
I'll write my new play with this.

340
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,980
You have no taste either!

341
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,310
I do in some things.

342
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,310
- It's from Jerska.
- So he did give you a book!

343
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,310
"Sonata for a Good Man"

344
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,230
"'Lazlo' and CMS unwrap presents,

345
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,140
then presumably have intercourse."

346
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,310
You're late.

347
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,600
Sorry, Captain.

348
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,730
Those red lights made me
lose all of four minutes.

349
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,930
You know how it is.

350
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:25,140
They're already at it! Unbelievable! These artists!

351
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,230
They're always at it!

352
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,520
That's why I prefer monitoring artists
to priests or peace activists.

353
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,810
See you tomorrow at 11 a.m.

354
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,640
Albert Jerska, operation 'Engerling'.
Systematic as usual, Wiesler.

355
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,600
The files will be sent. Let's have lunch.

356
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,980
The BSG Volleyball team will meet at 7 p.m.

357
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,350
Did you forget? Bosses sit over there.

358
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,100
Socialism must start somewhere.

359
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,730
About the license plate of the car

360
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,560
that brought Ms. Sieland home...

361
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,270
It's Minister Hempf's car.

362
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,310
Wiesler,

363
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,520
we can't monitor top officials.
I removed the entry in your report.

364
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,640
Nothing written from now on,

365
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,890
just oral!

366
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:50,390
So we're helping a Committee member
get a rival out of the way.

367
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,390
You know what this could mean

368
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,100
for my career. And for yours.

369
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,770
If we find something...

370
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,560
Is that why we joined?

371
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,810
You remember the oath we took?

372
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,390
"We are the Party's shield and sword."

373
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,930
What is the Party, if not its members?

374
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,480
And if those members
are highly influential, all the better!

375
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,060
I've got a new one.

376
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:27,270
Honecker comes into his office,

377
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,390
opens the window, sees the sun, and says...

378
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,560
What's wrong?

379
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,890
Oh, excuse me... I just...

380
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,100
No, carry on, colleague!

381
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,730
No harm in laughing about
the Party Chairman, is there.

382
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,230
I probably know the joke anyway.

383
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,930
Come on, tell us!

384
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,850
Well... Honecker...

385
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,680
I mean, the Comrade General Secretary
sees the sun and says,

386
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,770
- "Good morning, dear sun!"
- More like, "Good morning, dear sun!"

387
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:16,520
The sun replies, "Good morning, dear Erich!"

388
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,060
And at noon, Erich goes to the window and says,

389
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,680
"Good day, dear sun!"

390
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,100
The sun replies, "Good day, dear Erich!"

391
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,560
In the evening, Erich says again,

392
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,890
"Good evening, dear sun!"

393
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,640
and the sun doesn't reply.

394
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,180
"Good evening, dear sun..."

395
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,180
"What's wrong?" he asks.

396
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,480
And the sun replies,

397
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,770
"Screw you, I'm in the West now!"

398
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,640
Name?

399
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,020
Rank? Department?

400
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,140
Me?

401
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,850
Stigler.

402
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:59,520
2nd Lieutenant Axel Stigler. Dept. M.

403
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,230
I don't have to tell you

404
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,560
what this means for your career.

405
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:11,480
Please, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,
I was just...

406
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,680
You were just deriding the Party!
That's incitement,

407
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,180
and likely just the tip of the iceberg!

408
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,680
I will report this to the Minister's office.

409
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,680
Just kidding! Good one, huh?

410
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,480
But yours was good too.
I know a better one though.

411
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:44,230
What's the difference between Honecker and a phone?

412
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,350
None at all.

413
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,850
Hang up, try again!

414
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,810
- No, I have to get home.
- Bye.

415
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,970
Cold?

416
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,770
Christa, you forgot our meeting on Thursday.

417
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,930
Or did your poet have two birthdays in a row?

418
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
Come on, get in.

419
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:00,810
Get in!

420
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,890
You don't know what's good for you.

421
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,310
Don't worry.

422
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,100
I'm looking after you.

423
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,390
Tell me you don't need it too.

424
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,520
Just say so, and I'll let you go.

425
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,270
I'm meeting someone.

426
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,890
Where do you think we're going?

427
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:20,770
I'm taking you to him!
You'll be there even quicker.

428
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,140
Time for some bitter truths.

429
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,020
Yes?

430
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,350
Those idiots!

431
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,720
Next Thursday at the Metropol.

432
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,520
Drive!

433
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,810
Christa?

434
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,810
Just hold me.

435
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,520
Good evening, comrade!

436
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:18,100
You're 5 minutes late again.

437
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,680
Evening. 11th floor, right corridor.

438
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,020
I'm already up here.

439
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,140
How did you get into the building?

440
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,890
A bunch of you guys live here.

441
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:21,140
I don't think I've been here before.

442
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,270
No, I don't think you have.

443
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,560
Well? Was that nice?

444
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,350
- Stay awhile.
- I can't,

445
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,890
my next customer is at half-past.

446
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,720
I work on a schedule.

447
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,640
At one-thirty?
You won't make it.

448
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,310
Sure I will. Don't you worry.

449
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,430
Book me for longer next time.

450
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,140
Bye.

451
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,470
Georg? Did you hear about Hauser?

452
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:29,520
No, what happened?

453
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,810
He can't get a travel permit

454
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,390
for his lectures in the West.

455
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:37,350
Are you surprised?

456
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,890
If he acts so arrogantly,
he should expect it.

457
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,430
Would you let him go,
if you were in their position?

458
00:50:50,020 --> 00:51:00,270
"CMS comes home. 'Lazlo' approves of
Hauser's foreign travel ban."

459
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:09,680
Have you seen my Brecht book?

460
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,430
- What?
- My Brecht book.

461
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,310
I don't know where it is.

462
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,850
Strange. I could've sworn...

463
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:25,270
One day in blue-moon September,
silent under a plum tree,

464
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,020
I held her, my silent pale love,
in my arms like a fair

465
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,560
and lovely dream.

466
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,770
Above us in the summer skies

467
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:37,430
was a cloud that caught my eye.

468
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:41,520
It was white and so high up.

469
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,180
And when I looked up,
it was no longer there.

470
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,390
- Yes?
- Georg? Wallner here.

471
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:09,680
What's up?

472
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:13,220
Georg, it's about Jerska.

473
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,810
He hanged himself last night.

474
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,060
Georg?

475
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:30,270
I'm going to hang up, okay?

476
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,310
"Sonata for a Good Man"

477
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:22,600
You know what Lenin said
about Beethoven's 'Appassionata'.

478
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,520
"If I keep listening to it,

479
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,060
I won't finish the revolution."

480
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,390
Can anyone who has heard this music,

481
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:38,810
I mean truly heard it,

482
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:42,600
really be a bad person?

483
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,270
Are you really with the Stasi?

484
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,970
Do you even know what the Stasi is?

485
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:32,600
Yes. They're bad men
who put people in prison, says my dad.

486
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,720
I see.

487
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,350
What's the name of your...

488
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,430
My what?

489
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,600
Ball! What's the name of your ball?

490
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:50,270
You're funny! Balls don't have names.

491
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,890
It's all in place, Minister.

492
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,060
The latest technology.

493
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:04,350
Behind every light switch, even in the toilet.

494
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:07,770
- Measure C in the hall...
- You said you'd find something!

495
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:08,930
Find something!

496
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,680
I'd advise even my worst enemy
not to disappoint me.

497
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,810
Now get out of here!

498
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,850
Nowack, you're to watch Christa-Maria.

499
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,600
You'll report on every minute
that she's not with me.

500
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,600
We revoked Hauser's travel permit
for the culture conference.

501
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,970
Maybe that'll lead to something.
The two of them are very close.

502
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,430
How's it going between CMS and the Minister?

503
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,020
They're meeting tomorrow night, I think.

504
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,270
That's good! Very good!
We have a lot to gain from this love story.

505
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,310
Or a lot to lose.

506
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,140
Don't forget that.

507
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,810
I used to be afraid of just two things:

508
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,430
Being alone, and not being able to write.

509
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,720
Since Albert's death,
I don't care about writing

510
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,020
or about other people.

511
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:31,270
All I'm afraid of now is losing you.

512
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:35,390
You needn't be afraid tonight.

513
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,180
I'm just going out for a few hours.

514
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,770
Where to?

515
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:44,270
An old classmate's in town.

516
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,430
Really, Christa?

517
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,640
- Really?
- How dare you!

518
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,430
I know.

519
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,720
I know where you're going.

520
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,640
And I'm asking you not to go.

521
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,970
You don't need him.

522
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,060
You don't need him.

523
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,180
I know about your medication too.

524
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,390
And how little faith you have in your talent.

525
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:31,510
Have faith in me, at least.

526
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,890
Christa-Maria.

527
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:39,010
You are a great artist.

528
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:45,390
I know that.
And your audience knows it too.

529
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:48,640
You don't need him.

530
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:52,600
You don't need him.

531
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,680
Stay here.

532
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,560
Don't go to him.

533
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:08,600
No? Don't I need him?
Don't I need this whole system?

534
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,930
What about you?

535
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,220
Then you don't need it either.
Or need it even less.

536
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,100
But you get in bed with them too.

537
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,060
Why do you do it?

538
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:26,510
Because they can destroy you too,

539
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,640
despite your talent and your faith.

540
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:36,260
Because they decide what we play,
who is to act,

541
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,560
and who can direct.

542
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,180
You don't want to end up like Jerska.

543
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:46,720
And neither do I.

544
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,760
That's why I'm going now.

545
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:56,310
You're right about so many things,
and I want to change so much.

546
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,350
But I ask you,

547
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:03,930
I implore you: Don't go!

548
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,930
Well, boss, am I on time?

549
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:10,470
Let me guess what those two are doing...

550
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,890
Come on, I'll take over.

551
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:17,890
I don't want you
to do overtime because of me.

552
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:30,010
"Don't go through that door."

553
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,100
Where's she going?

554
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:36,060
To meet an old classmate.

555
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,220
You'll have my detailed report tomorrow.

556
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:45,930
I can manage.

557
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:51,510
Good night.

558
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,430
What are you staring at?

559
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:57,720
Soda water.

560
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,390
No, uh... Vodka.

561
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:05,640
Double.

562
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,260
Another one.

563
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:31,510
Can I have a cognac, please?

564
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,140
Madam?

565
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:28,510
Go away, I want to be alone.

566
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,720
Ms. Sieland.

567
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:34,760
Do we know each other?

568
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,930
You don't know me, but I know you.

569
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:41,720
Many people love you

570
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,060
for who you are.

571
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,220
- Actors are never 'who they are.'
- You are.

572
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:01,220
I've seen you on stage.

573
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:07,260
You were more who you are...

574
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:12,260
than you are now.

575
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,850
So you know what I'm like.

576
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,060
I'm your audience.

577
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:29,890
- I have to go.
- Where to?

578
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:34,720
I'm meeting an old classmate. I...

579
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:38,680
You see?
Just now you weren't being yourself.

580
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:41,890
No?

581
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:43,310
No.

582
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,310
So you know her well,
this Christa-Maria Sieland.

583
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:04,600
What do you think...

584
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:08,970
Would she hurt someone
who loves her above all else?

585
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:16,010
Would she sell herself for art?

586
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:18,140
For art?

587
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:22,060
You already have art.
That'd be a bad deal.

588
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,350
You are a great artist.

589
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,180
Don't you know that?

590
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:35,430
And you are a good man.

591
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:14,640
"When I begin my shift, 'Lazlo' and CMS

592
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,720
are arguing about whether CMS
should meet her classmate.

593
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:23,890
Eventually, she leaves.
'Lazlo' seems unhappy about this.

594
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:30,100
But after about 20 minutes, CMS returns,

595
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,470
to 'Lazlo's' surprise, and mine.

596
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,140
He seems very happy about this.
Vigorous acts of intimacy follow.

597
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,510
She says she'll never leave again.

598
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:50,060
He says repeatedly: 'Now I'll have the strength,
now I'll do something.'

599
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:54,510
This likely refers to writing a new stage play.

600
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:59,930
In recent weeks, 'Lazlo's' playwriting
had been plagued by difficulties.

601
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,850
What she means by her statement is unclear.

602
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:07,390
Perhaps she intends to
take better care of his household.

603
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:10,310
The rest of the night was peaceful."

604
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:18,010
Oh, comrade... uh... It's just because...
He's sleeping too...

605
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:20,100
Good report.

606
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,890
Really?

607
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:45,430
I didn't know he was in such a bad way.

608
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:50,850
Neither did I.

609
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,510
"On One Who Made it to the Other Side:

610
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,720
The statistics office on Hans Beimler Street

611
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:06,430
counts everything, knows everything.

612
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,970
How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.

613
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:12,560
How many books I read a year: 3.2.

614
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:19,310
And how many pupils graduate
with straight A's every year: 6347.

615
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,560
But there is one thing they don't count,

616
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:26,430
maybe because even bureaucrats find it painful,

617
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,310
and that's suicides.

618
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,680
If you call Beimler Street to ask

619
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,510
how many people between the Elbe and the Oder,

620
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,600
between the Baltic Sea and the Ore
Mountains despair drove to their death,

621
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,970
our numbers oracle is silent.

622
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:42,470
But it may just note your name
for State Security...

623
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,560
Those grey men

624
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:50,430
who ensure safety in our land... and happiness.

625
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:55,060
In 1977, our country
stopped counting suicides.

626
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:59,140
They called them 'self-murderers'.

627
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:03,010
But it has nothing to do with murder.

628
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:08,100
It knows no bloodlust,\no heated passion,

629
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:13,310
it knows only death, the death of all hope.

630
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:16,140
When we stopped counting,

631
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:19,680
only one country in Europe
drove more people to their death:

632
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:21,220
Hungary.

633
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:26,100
We came next, the land of
'Real Existing Socialism'.

634
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:29,260
One of the uncounted
is Albert Jerska,

635
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:31,100
the great director.

636
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,350
It's him I want to talk about today..."

637
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,810
I tried to get statistics that show...

638
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,310
...that State Security operates more
effectively than we think!

639
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:44,760
I foolishly rehearsed

640
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:56,640
my speech for the West in here.

641
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:02,140
Since then, I've become very musical.

642
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:06,010
We can meet at my place.

643
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,560
"3 p.m., Pankow Memorial"

644
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:24,350
Well? Is this safe enough?

645
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:31,260
My own 'bodyguard'.

646
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:34,100
I call him Rolf.
That's probably his name, too.

647
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:38,220
Fire away.

648
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:40,310
Here.

649
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,640
You want to publish this?

650
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,470
In the West, with your help.

651
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:04,760
Will you help? Have you told Christa?

652
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:06,060
No.

653
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:08,510
I'll help you,

654
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,180
as long as you don't tell her anything.

655
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,390
What?

656
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,680
Georg, it's for her own protection.

657
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,850
This could be right for the 'Spiegel'.

658
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,890
I'm friends with an editor there.

659
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,810
Gregor Hessenstein. Know him?

660
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:23,970
Not personally.

661
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,600
You have to meet him.

662
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:29,720
But you can't publish using your real name.

663
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:34,930
Unless your idea of fun
is a 48-hour interrogation.

664
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,060
I'm cold!

665
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:40,600
We could go to my place?

666
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:44,470
There's no State Security at my place!

667
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,140
A friend of Margot Honecker,

668
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,760
winner of the National Award...

669
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:50,510
Second class!

670
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,640
My apartment is clean, I tell you!

671
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,760
If only we could be sure...

672
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,430
I have an idea
how we can check your apartment.

673
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,100
You know my uncle Frank,

674
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,850
who visits from West Berlin every Saturday,

675
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:10,390
with his big gold Mercedes.

676
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,930
It seems a bit risky to me, Mr. Hauser.

677
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,310
Yes, I agree with Georg.

678
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:20,260
Hiding your nephew under the back seat?

679
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,310
I'm really not sure.

680
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:25,760
Come on, they won't search under the seats.

681
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:28,610
They'll look under the axles, tap the exhaust,

682
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,400
then I'll be across. Paul too.

683
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,820
The border guards aren't very bright.
You've got the wrong idea there.

684
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:42,950
- Which border will you cross?
- Heinrich-Heine Street.

685
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,740
Good old Henrich Heine.

686
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:48,110
They know me and my gold Mercedes.

687
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,150
I'm friends with the guards.

688
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,820
Trust me, I'll call you in 2 hours,

689
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,990
a Schultheiss beer in my hand,

690
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:58,900
and report the news:

691
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:00,650
Paul's across.

692
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,320
No! What about Paul's Stasi man?

693
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:09,610
Rolf! Rolfy, Rolfy...
He'll think that Paul's at home.

694
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,280
Okay, I have to go.

695
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:17,610
We wouldn't want him to suffocate, would we?

696
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,530
Another beer?

697
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,990
Border control, Heinrich-Heine Street.

698
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:46,150
Who is this?

699
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,450
Who is this?

700
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,280
No reply.

701
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,320
Just this once, my friend.

702
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:24,150
- Dreyman.
- Okay,

703
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,530
Paul's plan worked!

704
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,740
No border control at all?

705
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,820
No, no special checks.

706
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,780
Those boys aren't so bad.

707
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:35,860
It worked as planned.

708
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:38,530
Thanks for doing this, Mr. Hauser.

709
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:43,360
Forget it, it wasn't all that dangerous.

710
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:45,450
- Yeah, true.
- Yeah.

711
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:48,030
See you soon, and thanks a lot.

712
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:49,070
Bye.

713
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:02,030
What do we do if they ask
what we're doing together?

714
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:09,860
Then... we'll say

715
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:15,780
We'll say we're writing a stage play together.

716
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:19,400
For the GDR's 40th anniversary.

717
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:21,450
Yes!

718
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,450
And it's kind of true.

719
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:29,030
Who'd have thought our State Security

720
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:32,150
was so incompetent?

721
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:39,700
Who'd have thought they were such idiots?

722
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:45,320
Just you wait...

723
01:15:55,070 --> 01:16:08,780
"7.32 p.m. No further noteworthy incidents."

724
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:23,240
Hello, comrade. Listen to this here!

725
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:30,150
Sure, in 1967 there were many suicides.

726
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,700
But why in 1977? You must explain.

727
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,530
You must describe
the social conditions more clearly.

728
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:38,990
It should remain literature,

729
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:40,740
not political agitation.

730
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:42,490
The text is great.

731
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:46,110
I just want to be sure people
understand it in the West.

732
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,320
It'll cause a sensation either way.

733
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,950
- That's Hauser!
- Of course it's Hauser.

734
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,610
He's not in the West!

735
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,990
They're writing a play together.

736
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:08,200
For the 40th anniversary.

737
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:11,820
It doesn't sound like a play to me.

738
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,280
No? Then what?

739
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:20,070
I don't know... but not a play.

740
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:24,240
You think a lot, Sergeant Leye.

741
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:26,700
You're not an intellectual, are you?

742
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:29,610
Me? No... I'm not one of those.

743
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,110
Then don't behave like one.

744
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,950
I chose you because you know
the equipment

745
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:38,650
and don't ask questions.

746
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:41,610
Leave the thinking to your superiors.

747
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,070
Yes, Captain. I'll be off, then.

748
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:48,490
Have a nice day...

749
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:51,860
of work... I mean, I hope you enjoy your work.

750
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:58,490
Maybe I can re-write this part.

751
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,440
I'll send you

752
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:03,240
all the material we have.

753
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,570
Can you do it in two weeks?

754
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:08,860
Then I could run it as a cover story

755
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,150
for the first week in March.

756
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:14,820
It's Christa.

757
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:17,650
Georg?

758
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:22,780
Christa, this is Gregor Hessenstein.

759
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:26,820
- Christa Sieland.
- Of course, I know that!

760
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,280
So, what conspiracy are you cooking up?

761
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:34,690
Hauser and I are writing a play
for the GDR's 40th anniversary.

762
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:35,820
Together?

763
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:39,240
The 'Spiegel' may do an article on it.

764
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,280
- And who'll play the lead role?
- We planned to ask you.

765
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,400
Christa, who would you rather play:

766
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,530
Lenin or his dear old mother?

767
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:48,400
You can choose.

768
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,360
I see I'm not welcome here.

769
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,320
I'll go for a nap.

770
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:03,360
Your caution is praiseworthy.

771
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,780
The fewer people know, the better.

772
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:08,490
The Stasi is not to be toyed with.

773
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,150
On that note, I brought something for you.

774
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,940
I'd have preferred the whole pie.
I already have a typewriter.

775
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:29,070
The Stasi can identify its typeface.

776
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,900
If they intercepted the text at the border,

777
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:32,690
for your typewriter using,

778
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:34,610
you'd end up in Hohenschonhausen.

779
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:36,990
And that's no fun,

780
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:38,860
as Paul can confirm, right?

781
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:43,440
I'm afraid I could only get
a red ink ribbon for this model.

782
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:47,820
Do you mind writing it in red?

783
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,610
That won't be a problem.

784
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:53,570
Is there somewhere you can hide it?

785
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:57,900
- Yes, I'll find a place.
- Don't take it lightly.

786
01:19:58,610 --> 01:20:00,610
I don't want my next article to be about

787
01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:03,070
your disappearance!

788
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:06,110
Nobody may know that this typewriter exists!

789
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,650
Is this apartment really safe?

790
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,190
Yes.

791
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:15,860
It's the only place left in the GDR

792
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,940
where I can say what I want.

793
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:21,190
Fine, then let's drink to that!

794
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:26,610
This is the real stuff.

795
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:32,940
To you! To letting all of Germany
see the true face of the GDR!

796
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,530
Cheers. It's better than the Russian stuff!

797
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:45,820
To your success!

798
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,280
I must see Comrade Grubitz.

799
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:12,280
Tomorrow at 2.30 p.m...

800
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:18,360
Tell him that if he blows the cover,
we'll shut down the entire parish!

801
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,740
It's easy!

802
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:22,860
He can call the Pope and complain!

803
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:25,940
Okay, I've spent enough time on this nonsense.

804
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,940
Wiesler, I'm glad you're here.

805
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,400
I have to show you something.

806
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:38,690
"Prison Conditions for Subversive Artists
Based on Character Profile."

807
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,030
Pretty scientific, eh?

808
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:43,150
And look at this:

809
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:49,860
"Dissertation supervisor: A. Grubitz."
That's great, isn't it?

810
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:54,280
I only gave him a B...

811
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,320
They shouldn't think
getting a doctorate with me is easy.

812
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,440
But this is first-class.

813
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:04,990
Did you know that there are just 5 types of artists?

814
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,570
Your guy, Dreyman,

815
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:11,320
is a type 4. A "hysterical anthropocentrist."

816
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,320
Can't bear being alone,

817
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,240
always talking, needing friends.

818
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,690
That type should never be brought to trial.

819
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,440
They thrive on that.

820
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,940
Temporary detention is the best way

821
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:24,780
to deal with them.

822
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,650
Complete isolation and no set release date.

823
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:29,610
No human contact the whole time,

824
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:31,320
not even with the guards.

825
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:33,530
Good treatment,

826
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:36,110
no harassment, no abuse, no scandals...

827
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:38,570
nothing they could write about later.

828
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:42,690
After 10 months, we release.

829
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,650
Suddenly.

830
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,030
That guy won't cause us any more trouble.

831
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:48,690
Know what the best part is?

832
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:52,360
Most type 4s we've processed in this way

833
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:56,110
never write anything again! Or paint anything,

834
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:58,780
or whatever artists do...

835
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,610
And that without any use of force...

836
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:04,610
Just like that! Kind of...

837
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,740
like a present.

838
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,440
What brings you here?
Developments with Dreyman?

839
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:14,740
That's why I'm here.

840
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:17,940
I think the time has come...

841
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:19,820
For what?

842
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:23,860
For us to slim down the operation.

843
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:27,030
I don't want to run day and night shifts

844
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:30,190
for such an uncertain case.

845
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,740
Uncertain, eh?

846
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:35,400
You don't think we'll find anything

847
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:36,610
for the Minister?

848
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:39,400
Maybe if we're more flexible...

849
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:43,490
If we watch 'Lazlo' outside his own four walls.

850
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:49,240
Shall I give the case to Udo?

851
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:52,240
I'd like to continue it myself.

852
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:54,570
Why?

853
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,320
It could produce results.

854
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:01,110
I just need to plan more flexibly,

855
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:06,400
when I come and go, days and nights...

856
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:09,400
Maybe he's up to something outside.

857
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:16,360
Something doesn't feel right here.

858
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,570
There's something you're hiding.

859
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:32,610
Alright, I'll take Udo off the case.

860
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:36,320
I can use him for this church case.

861
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,990
Give me a request in writing.

862
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,780
Write as a reason:"Lack of suspicious acts."

863
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:48,900
And, Wiesler!

864
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:52,740
A piece of advice for you:

865
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:55,190
We're not at school anymore.

866
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:57,530
Projects aren't about grades,

867
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:59,690
but success.

868
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:18,860
"The state statistics office

869
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:21,150
counts everything, knows everything.

870
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:24,190
How many shoes I buy a year: 2.3.

871
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:26,900
How many books I read a year: 3.2.

872
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:35,070
And how many pupils graduate
with straight A's every year: 6347."

873
01:25:43,900 --> 01:26:01,150
"5 p.m. Lazlo reads the first act of
his anniversary play to Hauser and Wallner."

874
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:40,820
DENTAL PRACTICE

875
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,940
We're not writing a play, Christa.

876
01:27:48,030 --> 01:27:49,320
You don't have to tell me.

877
01:27:50,110 --> 01:27:52,690
But I want to. It's a text...

878
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:54,690
Don't tell me.

879
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,860
Maybe I am as unreliable as your friends say.

880
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,070
But I... I'm with you now...

881
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,110
No matter what.

882
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:45,240
Minister Riesenhuber, author of the report,

883
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:49,780
said there is no quick fix
for saving damaged forests.

884
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,690
East-West German relations under strain.

885
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:56,190
'Spiegel' magazine today published

886
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,740
a text by an unnamed East German author

887
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:03,150
about suicide in the German Democratic Republic.

888
01:29:03,990 --> 01:29:07,570
This follows a series of suicides by prominent

889
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:10,610
East-Berlin artists, the latest being Albert Jerska.

890
01:29:11,150 --> 01:29:14,280
After being blacklisted for 7 years,

891
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,280
Jerska committed suicide on January 5th.

892
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:22,320
In 1977, the GDR ceased publishing
any data relating to suicides.

893
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:26,320
That year, Hungary was the only country
in Europe with a higher suicide rate.

894
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,280
Yes, Sir...

895
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,490
But we...

896
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:36,400
General, our man at the 'Spiegel'

897
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:38,990
got us a photostat of the original.

898
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,940
Congratulations! So who wrote it?

899
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:45,030
He doesn't know, but using the typeface, we'll...

900
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:47,570
You're hopeless! Get me names!

901
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:50,530
I will, as soon as we get the results.

902
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:52,820
If not, you'll be put against the wall.

903
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:02,320
Andrea, where's the graphologist?

904
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:06,780
Thus I conclude that it is a domestic
typewriter produced for export,

905
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:09,490
most likely a 'Kolibri' travel model,

906
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:13,780
made by the VEB Groma.

907
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:16,440
If the ink were black, I could be more precise.

908
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:19,780
Who owns such a typewriter?

909
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:22,320
There are none registered in the GDR.

910
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:25,320
What does that mean?
What does Hauser use?

911
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,690
Paul Hauser uses a 'Valentino' typewriter,
made by Olivetti.

912
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:34,280
- That model has a more horizontal...
- Yes, yes! And Wallner?

913
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,740
He writes on an Optima 'Elite'.

914
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,070
Georg Dreyman?

915
01:30:42,110 --> 01:30:44,740
He writes his first drafts by hand,

916
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:47,820
then types them up
on a Wanderer 'Torpedo'.

917
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,530
He's never used anything else.

918
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:56,070
How big is this 'Kolibri' typewriter?

919
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:59,240
It's one of the smallest available:

920
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,320
19.5cm x 99cm x 19.55cm.

921
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:06,860
So it's as easy to smuggle as a book.

922
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:11,940
Thank you. You may go.

923
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,440
Goodbye, comrade.

924

"The Secret Suicide Statistics"

925
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,400
Andrea, put me through to Wiesler.

926
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:44,320
"4 p.m. The group is exhausted
from so much writing."

927
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:58,940
- Yes?
- Have you heard about this article?

928
01:31:59,570 --> 01:32:02,440
- In the 'Spiegel'? Yes.
- How so?

929
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:06,940
Hauser called Dreyman
and told him about it.

930
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:12,320
Wiesler, this is very important.
Both for my career and for yours.

931
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,860
Did he mention who may be behind it?
Or do you have any ideas?

932
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:22,860
I don't think he mentioned anything.
No... nothing at all.

933
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:31,360
A 'Spiegel' editor crossed the border
using a false name on the 27th,

934
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:34,440
and spent four hours here.

935
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:38,190
Dept. VI followed him to Prenzlauer Berg,
then lost his trail.

936
01:32:39,030 --> 01:32:41,320
Did he have contact with Dreyman?

937
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,740
- Wouldn't I have noted it in the report?
- Yes, of course.

938
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:49,320
But I smell a writer behind this text.

939
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,490
I'd be astonished if I'm wrong.

940
01:32:52,190 --> 01:32:54,110
So keep your ears open!

941
01:33:01,190 --> 01:33:02,490
Shit!

942
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:20,440
Get in.

943
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:39,110
If one of your staff deceives you,
you punish him, right?

944
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:40,900
Sure, sure!

945
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,650
Even a woman? Right?

946
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:46,030
But of course!

947
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:52,360
Isn't everyone who serves a great man
part of his staff?

948
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:54,240
You could see it like that...

949
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:57,570
Indeed, you'd have to see it like that.

950
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:05,110
This is where she gets her illegal medication.
Christa-Maria Sieland.

951
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:09,570
You should know this, it's your department.

952
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:14,280
It's up to you whether you ruin her or not,

953
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:19,150
but I never want to see her
on a German stage again.

954
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,740
Now get out.

955
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,690
Shut the door!

956
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:38,150
Ms. Sieland? Please follow us.
We have some questions.

957
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,740
Come along.

958
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:03,360
So...

959
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,480
Comrade Sieland, a beautiful career you had, hm?

960
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:12,650
A pity really. You were good.

961
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:14,940
You were very good indeed.

962
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:18,650
Just too short-lived.

963
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:21,110
Do have a seat.

964
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:32,610
What do actors do when they can't act anymore?

965
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:39,070
Please...

966
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,860
Isn't there anything I can do for you?

967
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:50,900
- For... State Security?
- It's a little late for that.

968
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:54,730
I know nearly all our artists.

969
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:56,610
I could find out a lot.

970
01:35:56,690 --> 01:36:00,110
I believe you.
But it won't help you now.

971
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:13,780
Maybe there's something else I could do?

972
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,980
Something we might both find agreeable.

973
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:25,690
Unfortunately,

974
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,070
you've made an enemy
of a very powerful man.

975
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:32,610
Therefore, I have less freedom
than would normally be the case.

976
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:38,110
Is there no way I can save myself?

977
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:42,400
I'm sorry, madam.

978
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,940
There is one possibility.

979
01:36:55,690 --> 01:37:00,780
Since you spend so much time
with writers and artists...

980
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:06,480
You don't know anything about an article
from this week's 'Spiegel', do you?

981
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:09,360
An article about suicide.

982
01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:04,860
State Security! Open the door!

983
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:14,110
Open up!

984
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,900
He's turned on the light in his study.

985
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,610
Go in before he destroys any evidence.

986
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:27,360
Crowbar!

987
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,530
I don't think that'll be necessary.

988
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:36,320
- What's the matter, comrades?
- We have a warrant to search the premises.

989
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:37,780
Warrant is here.

990
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:41,190
- What are you looking for?
- It's confidential.

991
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:44,650
Boysen, Muller: bedroom.

992
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:46,610
Greska: kitchen, bathroom, hall.

993
01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:49,780
Heise and Thomas: living room, study.

994
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:50,690
Go!

995
01:39:41,150 --> 01:39:42,820
What do you burn in here?

996
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:45,480
Substandard texts.

997
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:54,190
A lot of Western literature, eh?

998
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:58,030
That book was a gift from Margot Honecker.

999
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:04,230
- Status?
- All according to plan.

1000
01:40:08,730 --> 01:40:13,320
We found nothing,
except Western books and newspapers.

1001
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:18,440
- No trace to be found!
- Did you search thoroughly?

1002
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:22,320
Yes, Comrade! What's our next move?

1003
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:31,280
- Comrade?
- Pull out your men!

1004
01:40:33,730 --> 01:40:38,730
In the unlikely event that damage has
occurred, you may claim compensation.

1005
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:42,070
I'm sure everything's in perfect order.

1006
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:06,320
Yes?

1007
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:09,730
Wiesler, I'll be expecting you
in Hohenschonhausen at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

1008
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:16,570
Okay, I'll say what we're all thinking:

1009
01:41:16,650 --> 01:41:18,440
It was Christa-Maria.

1010
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:20,860
The Stasi got her, and she ratted on you.

1011
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:24,820
It wasn't her.

1012
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:26,820
How can you be so sure?

1013
01:41:27,820 --> 01:41:30,610
You yourself said she wasn't home last night.

1014
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:36,730
She knows the hiding place.

1015
01:41:38,150 --> 01:41:39,280
Yes, she knows.

1016
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,280
So if you're right,

1017
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:49,690
and the search was due to her,

1018
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,940
then she's our guardian angel.

1019
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,690
I'm here to see Lt. Col. Grubitz.

1020
01:42:01,110 --> 01:42:02,480
Captain Wiesler.

1021
01:42:03,570 --> 01:42:05,110
Interrogation room 76.

1022
01:42:22,230 --> 01:42:24,110
Yes! Come in.

1023
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:29,730
Sit down.

1024
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,280
So?

1025
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:42,650
What was that about?

1026
01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:45,570
You're asking me what that was about?

1027
01:42:48,230 --> 01:42:50,190
What do you suspect Dreyman of?

1028
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,980
He wrote the 'Spiegel' article.

1029
01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:00,280
Who alleges that?

1030
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,900
Come with me!

1031
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:17,780
Here.

1032
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:22,860
I don't know how you could be
so sloppy as to miss all of this!

1033
01:43:24,690 --> 01:43:27,360
But I know you differently,
especially as an interrogator.

1034
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,360
So I'm giving you one last chance.

1035
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:33,860
Bring in prisoner 662, now!

1036
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:40,440
Are you still on the right side?

1037
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:45,860
Yes.

1038
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,730
Then don't screw it up again.

1039
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:14,230
Shall I restrain the prisoner?

1040
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:18,480
No, she's an informant now. You may go.

1041
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:26,610
So you're my commanding officer?

1042
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:28,780
Write.

1043
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:30,730
Then command me.

1044
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:48,900
In another 10 hours...

1045
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:52,780
No, in 9 and a half,

1046
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:55,320
Mr. Roessing will tell the audience that

1047
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:58,980
you, for health reasons, cannot appear.

1048
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:04,190
And that will be your last mention
in the acting world.

1049
01:45:06,030 --> 01:45:07,030
Is that what you want?

1050
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:13,070
Tell us where the evidence is hidden.

1051
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:16,070
There is no evidence,

1052
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:19,980
and no typewriter. I made it all up.

1053
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:22,570
I hope not.

1054
01:45:24,190 --> 01:45:26,440
If so, we'll have to keep you here.

1055
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:31,690
A false statement is perjury,
which carries around 2 years in prison.

1056
01:45:34,730 --> 01:45:36,780
Dreyman will go to prison anyway,

1057
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,110
on account of your statement...

1058
01:45:41,570 --> 01:45:45,150
and the material
we've already found in the apartment.

1059
01:45:48,730 --> 01:45:51,190
Save yourself, at least.

1060
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:55,070
You have no idea how many people

1061
01:45:55,110 --> 01:45:57,530
are in jail here for senseless heroics.

1062
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:02,820
Don't forget your audience.

1063
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:07,570
"Don't forget your audience!"
He has some funny ideas!

1064
01:46:12,110 --> 01:46:14,690
Don't forget what the state has done for you...

1065
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:19,110
Your whole life long.

1066
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,780
Now you can do something for the state.

1067
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:23,780
And it will thank you.

1068
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:28,610
Tell me where the typewriter's hidden.

1069
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:33,400
Dreyman will never find out.

1070
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:35,860
I'll let you go immediately,

1071
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:38,820
and we'll strike only after you're back with him.

1072
01:46:40,570 --> 01:46:43,570
You'll manage to feign surprise, I'm sure.

1073
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,940
And tonight you'll be back on stage.

1074
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:51,980
In your element.

1075
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:55,730
In front of your audience.

1076
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:07,860
Tell me where the documents are.

1077
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,690
Where are they?

1078
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:26,480
They're in the apartment...

1079
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:31,860
Under the doorsill,

1080
01:47:32,230 --> 01:47:37,320
between the living room and the hallway.

1081
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:43,150
You can remove it.

1082
01:47:57,150 --> 01:48:00,610
Is this where you mean?
Mark the exact place with a cross.

1083
01:48:31,070 --> 01:48:34,900
You look worn out.
Remember, you're an informant now.

1084
01:48:35,030 --> 01:48:38,110
That means responsibilities,
like conspiracy and confidentiality,

1085
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:42,940
but also privileges...

1086
01:49:05,690 --> 01:49:07,070
Guard!

1087
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:09,110
Call Wiesler for me!

1088
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:12,110
Col. Wiesler has left the premises, comrade.

1089
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:13,980
I see!

1090
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:17,530
Alright. Stand down.

1091
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:36,320
What does a rider do when he's thrown?

1092
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:37,980
He gets back on again.

1093
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,280
Go inside. Sleep it off.

1094
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:43,610
What happened has nothing to do with the house.

1095
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:45,980
No, but with the whole country.

1096
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:52,820
Christa!

1097
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:57,650
Stop, I was at Kerschner's and they had no water.
I need a shower.

1098
01:51:15,570 --> 01:51:18,150
You were in a hurry to get here!

1099
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:20,480
- Operation 'Lazlo' is still in progress!
- Are they both inside?

1100
01:51:20,570 --> 01:51:21,730
Yes.

1101
01:51:23,190 --> 01:51:24,650
Here's today's report.

1102
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:29,150
The last report for Operation 'Lazlo'.

1103
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:52,150
Why didn't you call me?

1104
01:51:53,150 --> 01:51:54,230
What?

1105
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,030
Why didn't you call me?

1106
01:51:58,230 --> 01:51:59,480
I was out in the country.

1107
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:04,030
Can you hand me the nail brush?

1108
01:52:09,230 --> 01:52:11,980
The Stasi was here.
They searched the apartment.

1109
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,320
Who was here?

1110
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:18,690
State Security! Open up!

1111
01:52:19,610 --> 01:52:20,650
Stay here.

1112
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,820
Hello, Comrade Dreyman.
I'm Lt. Col. Grubitz from State Security.

1113
01:52:33,190 --> 01:52:36,980
I just wanted to make sure
they did a thorough job last night.

1114
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,820
Your study? We'll start there.

1115
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:50,900
Men, search carefully
for notes hidden in the books.

1116
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:13,150
Oh, what do we have here?

1117
01:53:16,150 --> 01:53:18,270
This doorsill doesn't look kosher to me.

1118
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:27,440
Could it be... a secret compartment?

1119
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,480
Let her go. She's not a suspect.

1120
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:01,270
The actress...

1121
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:35,270
I was too weak.

1122
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:37,980
I can never put right what I've done wrong.

1123
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:40,520
There's nothing to put right!
You understand? Nothing.

1124
01:54:40,610 --> 01:54:43,020
I moved the ty...

1125
01:54:53,520 --> 01:55:01,860
Forgive me, forgive me... Forgive me, forgive me...

1126
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:32,570
Take your men back to headquarters.
This mission is over.

1127
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:52,570
I've concluded the mission, Comrade Dreyman.
We must have received an erroneous tip-off.

1128
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:55,070
Sorry.

1129
01:55:57,610 --> 01:55:59,110
Come on.

1130
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:01,150
There's one thing you should understand, Wiesler.

1131
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:03,820
Your career is over.

1132
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:08,110
Even if you were too smart to leave any traces.

1133
01:57:09,610 --> 01:57:13,900
You'll end up in some cellar,
steam-opening letters until you retire.

1134
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:16,770
That means the next 20 years.

1135
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:19,110
20 years!

1136
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:21,900
That's a long time.

1137
01:57:32,110 --> 01:57:35,520
"Mikhail Gorbachev elected as leader
of the Soviet Union's Communist Party."

1138
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:41,690
4 YEARS AND 7 MONTHS LATER

1139
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:01,440
The Wall has come down!

1140
01:58:06,570 --> 01:58:07,820
Yes, the Wall has come down!

1141
01:58:13,730 --> 01:58:18,270
The border guards have opened the gates.
The excitement is enormous!

1142
01:58:18,270 --> 01:58:21,650
People are streaming out in thousands!
It's unbelievable!

1143
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:25,520
Dear listeners, November 9th, 1989,

1144
01:58:25,650 --> 01:58:29,860
will go down in history!

1145
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:56,940
TWO YEARS LATER

1146
01:58:59,110 --> 01:59:01,770
What's wrong, my child?

1147
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:04,270
Your Arthur is dead.

1148
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:11,520
Arthur... Can't you be wrong, just this once?

1149
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:14,020
I saw him this morning!

1150
01:59:14,150 --> 01:59:17,320
No, sister. Believe me.
He fell to his death.

1151
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:21,770
The loyal men surround him, as you do me,

1152
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:24,110
and despite the high sun, cast

1153
01:59:24,230 --> 01:59:28,480
seven shadows on his noble dead body.

1154
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:33,520
Crushed by the mighty wheel. I see it,

1155
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:36,610
though I'd rather see any other horror.

1156
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:42,110
Why am I not spared these visions?

1157
01:59:43,650 --> 01:59:47,900
Elena! Go home and mourn.

1158
01:59:48,650 --> 01:59:50,980
I will finish your shift.

1159
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:02,570
Too many memories, eh?

1160
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:09,690
I couldn't stay in there either.

1161
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:14,190
But what's this I hear?

1162
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:17,900
You've not written since the Wall fell?

1163
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,070
That's not good.

1164
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,190
After all our country invested in you.

1165
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:28,320
Although I understand you, Dreyman.

1166
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,610
What is there to write about in this new Germany?

1167
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:35,270
Nothing to believe in, nothing to rebel against...

1168
02:00:39,230 --> 02:00:41,770
Life was good in our little Republic.

1169
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:44,940
Many people only realize that now.

1170
02:00:45,230 --> 02:00:49,690
- There is one thing I do need to ask you.
- Whatever you want.

1171
02:00:50,070 --> 02:00:51,650
Why was I never under surveillance?

1172
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:56,190
Everyone else was. Why not me?

1173
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:04,270
You were under full surveillance!

1174
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:07,360
We knew everything about you.

1175
02:01:08,730 --> 02:01:10,110
Full surveillance?

1176
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,940
Every inch was bugged. The full program.

1177
02:01:16,190 --> 02:01:17,190
Impossible!

1178
02:01:20,070 --> 02:01:22,650
Take a look behind your light switches.

1179
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:24,730
We knew everything.

1180
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:32,320
We knew that you couldn't give
our little Christa what she needed.

1181
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:41,270
To think that people like you
once ruled a country...

1182
02:03:06,230 --> 02:03:09,150
RESEARCH SITE AND MEMORIAL

1183
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:23,070
It'll be a moment, there should be
more than one file in your case.

1184
02:04:07,570 --> 02:04:09,940
I ordered them chronologically.

1185
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:12,980
Old ones at the top,
and the newer ones underneath.

1186
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:16,270
My respects!

1187
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:43,770
Operation 'Lazlo'. Operation 'Lazlo', subject:
Georg Dreyman, code-name 'Lazlo', is launched.

1188
02:04:44,110 --> 02:04:47,650
The lead came from Minister Bruno Hempf.

1189
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:56,610
'Lazlo' takes delivery of a daily Western newspaper
without official permission.

1190
02:04:56,860 --> 02:04:59,900
I suggest not taking any action

1191
02:04:59,980 --> 02:05:03,070
so as not to arouse suspicion of surveillance.

1192
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:07,520
'Lazlo' and CMS unwrap presents,

1193
02:05:07,610 --> 02:05:10,400
then presumably have intercourse.

1194
02:05:19,770 --> 02:05:23,690
The visitor was Paul Hauser's uncle from West Berlin.

1195
02:05:23,980 --> 02:05:27,860
They tell him about a play
that Hauser

1196
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:31,150
and 'Lazlo' will write
for the GDR's 40th anniversary.

1197
02:05:34,520 --> 02:05:37,940
We expect further information on the play,

1198
02:05:37,980 --> 02:05:40,230
a plot summary etc.

1199
02:05:41,860 --> 02:05:43,900
Contents of act 1:

1200
02:05:44,900 --> 02:05:46,820
Lenin is in constant danger.

1201
02:05:47,610 --> 02:05:51,980
Despite increasing external pressure,
he sticks to his revolutionary plans.

1202
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:56,150
Lenin is exhausted.

1203
02:06:02,900 --> 02:06:03,730
HGW...

1204
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:08,900
HGW XX-7...

1205
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:24,360
I, Christa-Maria Sieland,

1206
02:06:24,690 --> 02:06:29,570
freely commit myself to work unofficially
for State Security.

1207
02:06:30,650 --> 02:06:35,070
This decision is the result of my conviction that...

1208
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:41,190
Georg Dreyman

1209
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:44,520
wrote the 'Spiegel' article
"One Who Made it to the Other Side."

1210
02:06:45,110 --> 02:06:48,360
His accomplices were the journalist Paul Hauser...

1211
02:06:57,190 --> 02:07:00,860
Christa Sieland was arrested on March 10th

1212
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:04,230
for drug abuse, on Minister Hempf's indication.

1213
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:07,860
She was released at 1.50 p.m. on March 11th,

1214
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:11,190
having revealed 'Lazlo's hiding place

1215
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:15,190
and signing up as informant 'Marta'.

1216
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:22,320
1.50 p.m...

1217
02:07:24,070 --> 02:07:25,480
So when did she...

1218
02:07:26,070 --> 02:07:28,610
After the unsuccessful house
search of March 11, 1985,

1219
02:07:28,690 --> 02:07:33,110
and 'Marta's' fatal accident,

1220
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:35,360
Operation 'Lazlo' was terminated.

1221
02:07:39,650 --> 02:07:43,820
Note: HGW's promotion ban
takes effect immediately.

1222
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:46,480
Transfer to Dept. M,

1223
02:07:46,610 --> 02:07:50,770
with the recommendation not to entrust him
with missions under his sole responsibility.

1224
02:07:53,150 --> 02:07:58,110
10:50 a.m.: Resume surveillance
outside 'Lazlo's' house.

1225
02:08:00,650 --> 02:08:04,820
At 3.10 p.m., 'Marta' comes directly from
Hohenschonhausen to his apartment.

1226
02:08:06,150 --> 02:08:08,900
House search and report to follow.

1227
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:14,360
End of Operation 'Lazlo'. HGW, 3.15 p.m.

1228
02:08:32,730 --> 02:08:34,570
Who is HGW XX-7?

1229
02:09:19,690 --> 02:09:21,190
Stop.

1230
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:14,230
Back to Hufeland Street.

1231
02:10:39,230 --> 02:10:42,020
TWO YEARS LATER

"Sonata for a Good Man"

1234
02:11:58,860 --> 02:12:00,230
29,80.

1235
02:12:01,150 --> 02:12:02,020
Shall I gift-wrap it?

1236
02:12:03,860 --> 02:12:06,480
No, it's for me.

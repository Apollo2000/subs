00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:18,038
The Gold Trail
Montana 1873

3
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:25,956
Every new mining town's gotta have a
hanging tree.  Makes folks feel respectable.

4
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,813
Everything for sale?

5
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:15,530
I wouldn't sell except
I'm needing a grubstake.

6
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:18,032
How about that cabin over there?

7
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:23,412
That belongs to the fellow that runs
the general store, but he ain't selling.

8
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:28,337
- How much?
- How much would you say?

9
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:33,968
- If you left it up to me: 5 cents.
- How about 1,000 - dust or nuggets?

10
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:39,337
- $ 500.
- Oh, she's worth more than that, lock stock and barrel.

11
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:42,301
$500 in gold coins.

12
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:59,990
Come on, let's go!

13
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:03,158
I'll throw her in for another
$5 gold piece.

14
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,243
No, thanks.

15
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:44,080
- Hey!
Sluice robber!

16
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:54,881
Hey, I think I got him!

17
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:59,045
Sluice robber! Sluice robber!

18
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:07,061
I got him real good!
Keep your eyes open for blood spots!

19
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:20,942
Hey!

20
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,069
Sluice robber!

21
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:39,060
I don't suppose
you would help me.

22
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:41,273
Sluice robber!

23
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,283
- Sluice robber? Why should I?
- I'm bad hurt.

24
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:21,446
- Where is my shirt?
- I burned it.

25
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,529
What for? That's the
only shirt I've got.

26
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:27,609
If you wore that out of here,
they'd hang you.

27
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:32,124
- How did it feel?
- I've been better.

28
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,909
It ought to.
After what I dug out of you.

29
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,839
Leave a big hole?

30
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:43,961
Yes, but it will heal.

31
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,590
- What's your name?
- What's yours?

32
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,267
Doctor Joe Frail.

33
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,972
My name's Rune.

34
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,726
- Rune what?
- That's all. Just Rune.

35
00:09:03,155 --> 00:09:05,195
- Where are you from?
- Where are you from?

36
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:08,279
Will you stop answering my questions
with another question?

37
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:12,486
Stop asking me questions, then!

38
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,115
How do you expect to pay me
for my professional services?

39
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:20,463
I can pay you nothing.

40
00:09:20,673 --> 00:09:24,753
If I had any money, do you think I'd be dumb enough
to rob a sluice box and get myself hung?

41
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:28,551
Do you think I want to doctor you and
treat you for nothing?

42
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:32,300
Of course, you could earn your keep.

43
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:44,191
I could use a manservant.

44
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:47,690
All gentlemen should have one to black his boots
and swamp out the cabin.

45
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:52,120
- You can cook, I hope.
- No! And I ain't no servant!

46
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:55,785
All forms of life can be taught.

47
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,660
Even fleas.

48
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, you will be my bond servant.
And do as I tell you.

49
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:05,335
You can go to hell!

50
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,556
You know what that is?

51
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:17,306
It's the bullet I dug out of you.

52
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:20,095
An unusual calibre.

53
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:24,100
Even if they didn't see your face, this
could be your mark for the hanging tree.

54
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:30,866
How long will I have to work as your
servant before we get even?

55
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:34,909
As long as I say.
Maybe forever.

56
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:39,167
If I had let you bleed to death

57
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:41,079
You'd be dead forever.

58
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:48,002
You can start by cleaning up
this cabin from top to bottom.

59
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:55,509
Then you go down and pass the word
that Dr. Frail is open for business.

60
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:06,642
Doctor in town up on the hill!

61
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:08,819
There's a doctor up there.

62
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:12,898
What would we want with a doctor?

63
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:16,990
Come here.

64
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:19,033
How old are you?

65
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:29,253
New doctor in town!

66
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:32,209
A doctor in town up on the hill!

67
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:35,430
Open all hours!

68
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:38,017
Hey, boy!

69
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:42,518
- What's that doctor's name?
- Frail.

70
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:44,767
- Joe Frail?
- Yes.

71
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:47,518
You tell him you saw Tom Flaunce.

72
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:49,563
- All right.
- Thanks.

73
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,034
A doctor in town!
A doctor in town!

74
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:03,456
Doctor up there!

75
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:07,371
- Where is he?
- Dr. Frail. Up on the hill.

76
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:52,422
Let me see your teeth.

77
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,090
Nothing the matter here
except malnutrition.

78
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,559
What's that, Doc?

79
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:08,437
Not the right kind of food
and not enough of it.

80
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:13,111
I ain't had luck at the diggings, Doc.
We do the best we can.

81
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:16,525
There's a cow tied up in back,
coming fresh pretty quick.

82
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:19,150
Take it with you. I'm packing
this child on milk.

83
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:22,117
I can't pay for no cow.

84
00:13:22,873 --> 00:13:24,913
I'll loan it to you.

85
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,620
Oh.

86
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:30,749
Thank you, Doc.

87
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,790
How much do we owe you, Doctor?

88
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:37,926
Give me a kiss.

89
00:13:40,307 --> 00:13:44,008
- I'm paid.

90
00:13:55,364 --> 00:13:57,072
Who is that?

91
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:01,068
Now hear me, brethren!

92
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:06,498
If you bring your sick to the butcher
doctor, they will die!

93
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,367
His instruments are foul with sin!

94
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:14,540
If you are sick,
come unto me!

95
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:17,463
And I will lay my hands on you

96
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:20,881
And my hands will make you well.

97
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:26,639
Don't enter this place! Don't succumb to
the black magic of this devil's spawn!

98
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:28,473
Hello Grubb.

99
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:32,730
Don't turn your evil
eyes on me, Joseph Frail.

100
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:36,397
Brethren beware!
The Bible says...

101
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:38,606
Here's his Bible!

102
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:43,654
Beware, Joseph Frail. He who
diggeth the pit...

103
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,999
will fall into it!

104
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:09,970
Well, who's next?

105
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:15,812
Me, Doc. Remember me?
I was over at Oldrich Gulch last year.

106
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:19,648
Well, Frenchy. Are you ill
or looking for a stake?

107
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:22,617
No, I have a carbuncle on the rump.
Figured you could lance it for me.

108
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,160
That costs one ounce of dust,
or $20 hard money.

109
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:29,907
- Can you pay this time?
- Well, I got a little bit in the poke.

110
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,620
Come on in.

111
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:50,510
- Got yourself a helper, Doc?
- That's right.

112
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:53,303
Drop your pants and
bend over the table.

113
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:57,189
Rune, this is Frenchy Plante.
Don't believe a word he says

114
00:15:57,403 --> 00:16:00,487
And don't ever let him
get behind you in the dark.

115
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:04,861
- The Doc's sure a caution, kid.
- I've found out.

116
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:09,490
-  I just wish I could swing a gun like Doc here.
- Be sure to burn it.

117
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:12,661
Ever swing a gun, kid?

118
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:17,955
Doc! I came for a cure
not a killing!

119
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:25,676
If I could swing a gun like that,
I'd be the biggest man in Montana.

120
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,634
Ow! Doctor!

121
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:30,851
People would sure back off
the street when I'd come to town.

122
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:34,015
Kid, it's not old Frenchy, it's the Doc
you gotta watch out...

123
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:36,390
Oh! Ah!

124
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,148
Ahhhh!

125
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,659
Hey, quit it. Nobody's listening.

126
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:01,126
300.

127
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,673
Society Red bets 300.

128
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:08,388
- Too dear for me.
- I can't do it.

129
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:14,099
- Check that 300.
- And raise you 300.

130
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:27,280
I'd like to call and raise with
this gold claim.

131
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:30,909
- Where is it located?
- Around the bend.

132
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:33,161
I'll allow 2,000.

133
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,452
- How much of it?
- All of it.

134
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:50,550
Take your time, Doc.

135
00:17:57,231 --> 00:18:02,142
Like the man says, when the wind blows
too hard, tree's gotta bend.

136
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:06,947
Now wait a minute.
The tree hasn't blown down yet.

137
00:18:10,286 --> 00:18:11,780
Call.

138
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:18,623
Ace high.

139
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:26,385
A pair of deuces.

140
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:37,521
What you gonna do
with all that, Doc?

141
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,181
Buy a ticket back to Illinois
and burn down another house?

142
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:49,606
I ain't gonna slap no
leather with you, Doc Frail.

143
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:55,238
Take the money, Rune.

144
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,180
What's that about him
burning a house down?

145
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:29,276
He hit that fella. He did nothing
and he nearly killed him.

146
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,407
Unsaddle my horse and
stake him out.

147
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:36,320
All he said was something
about a house burning down.

148
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,789
Are you gonna kill
a man for that?

149
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:41,994
Rune...

150
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,208
We're starting a new regime.

151
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:48,665
We rise at 4:30...

152
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:51,542
work the claim until 8:30...

153
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:55,843
Then we come here and take care of patients.
Any questions?

154
00:19:58,102 --> 00:20:02,479
Any questions about my life
or my way of life?

155
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:07,853
- No.
- Good. Go unsaddle the horse.

156
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,651
That Frenchy wasn't far wrong.

157
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:21,865
If you aren't the devil,
he's sure sitting on your shoulder.

158
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:03,762
- 15,000. Take or leave.
- Okay.

159
00:22:03,978 --> 00:22:05,472
Hey, Doc!

160
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:07,932
Hey, Doc!

161
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:14,692
There's a fellow in town.
He needs you bad. Stagecoach driver.

162
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:19,484
- He staggered in half dead - took 3 days to get here.
- What happened to the passengers?

163
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:23,238
- The coach got held up and all the passengers killed!
- All except for a lady.

164
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:27,834
- She got lost.
- And the driver says she was a real looker.

165
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:33,465
Mr. Flaunce, you know the canyons around here.
Would you lead a posse to find that lady?

166
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:36,758
- Yes, all right.
- You take the posse back down that road.

167
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:39,050
Coming, Doc?

168
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:43,344
I'd better stay.  There's the stage driver
and I have patients waiting for me.

169
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:46,259
Want to ride with us, kid?

170
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,723
I got no horse.

171
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:51,977
Take mine.

172
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:56,060
How come?
What if I just kept on going?

173
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,194
No matter where you went,
that bullet hole would tell its story.

174
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:08,454
Which posse are you riding with?

175
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,667
- I'm gonna look for that Lost Lady.
- That figures.

176
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:21,879
Watch yourself. I don't want my
bondservant crippled.

177
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:26,762
Don't worry, I'll take good care of
your property and your horse too.

178
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,278
There!

179
00:24:10,396 --> 00:24:12,721
She isn't here.

180
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:20,187
There's something.

181
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:28,954
Letter's to her.

182
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:34,503
Name's Elizabeth Mahler, from
Switzerland. This is to her father.

183
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:38,662
Well, he sure can't read it
in his grave.

184
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:43,842
Well, the lord only knows which way she headed.
Let's all fan out...

185
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:48,012
And meet us up
at Stump Meadow.

186
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:52,437
She'll need good clothes to
survive these cold nights.

187
00:24:52,646 --> 00:24:56,596
Well, if you find her dead,
fire two shots. If alive, three.

188
00:25:07,995 --> 00:25:10,154
- Any luck?
- No.

189
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:13,907
- How many are still out?
- About a dozen.

190
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:17,044
Well, all right.
We'd better bed down for the night.

191
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:24,344
Stinking country. You get fried days
and froze nights.

192
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:28,385
At least we got
blankets and a fire.

193
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:36,514
But she?
We're gonna find her dead.

194
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:41,858
- You know you're bleeding, son?
- Sure, a thorn bush tear.

195
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:46,318
- You known Doc Frail long?
- Not too long.

196
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:50,488
Have some jerky.

197
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:53,910
Thank you.

198
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,247
I've known Doc Frail 5 years.
Ever since the Bannock strike.

199
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:04,792
We do a little business together
off and on.

200
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:09,127
The Doc could have had it pretty
easy half a dozen times

201
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:13,263
But he can't seem to get away
from that little black bag of his.

202
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:18,554
- Maybe he carries his soul in it.
- That's good...what soul he's got.

203
00:26:18,941 --> 00:26:24,280
Once I asked the Doc
about that name of his: Frail.

204
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,116
All he said was...

205
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:36,998
...it suited a man with frail hope.

206
00:26:37,835 --> 00:26:40,243
You knew that wasn't his
real name, didn't you?

207
00:26:40,504 --> 00:26:41,999
No, I didn't.

208
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,584
- A strange man, the Doc.
- Yes.

209
00:26:47,136 --> 00:26:49,841
Tried to get himself killed.

210
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:52,345
I know he slammed a fellow,

211
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,093
because this fellow asked
about a house that burned down.

212
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,972
A wonder the Doc
didn't shoot him.

213
00:27:00,191 --> 00:27:02,349
Why would he have shot him?

214
00:27:02,568 --> 00:27:05,486
There's a story about the Doc.

215
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:09,231
A man named Temple
was a doctor.

216
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,317
He lived in a town where
the Ohio runs into the Mississippi.

217
00:27:13,537 --> 00:27:17,749
Seems the doctor lived in a fine grand house
on the point that overlooked the joining of the waters.

218
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:21,209
And something happened in
that house one night.

219
00:27:21,671 --> 00:27:23,912
A man and a woman were killed.

220
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:28,665
And the doctor...

221
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:32,718
...put a torch to the house
and burned it to the ground.

222
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,217
You can still see the burned fingers sticking
above the willows where the rivers meet.

223
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:31,441
- See anything?
- Rattlesnakes.

224
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:35,157
I dunno, something.
Hey, you looking to kill a snake?

225
00:28:52,345 --> 00:28:53,839
Lady!

226
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:57,134
Lady!

227
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,725
Lady!
I've got water. I've got water!

228
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,982
Water. Water.

229
00:29:17,203 --> 00:29:20,572
No, no.
Not so fast, lost lady.

230
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,952
Please, lady. I...

231
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:31,373
... I'm going
to shoot off a gun, ma'am.

232
00:29:32,426 --> 00:29:34,086
Lady...

233
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:39,759
Lady, don't be scared.

234
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:42,727
I'm going to shoot off a gun

235
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:47,515
to call the other searchers here.

236
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:52,691
You're going to be all right, Ma'am.
Frenchy promises.

237
00:30:16,804 --> 00:30:19,260
- Come here!
- Is she alive?

238
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:22,095
Yes, but she sure is cooked.
She's cooked good.

239
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:30,811
Come here. Look, how she's
hanging on to my canteen.

240
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:33,981
She won't let go, see?

241
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:36,439
The poor thing ought to be dead.

242
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:42,404
Ain't much left from the neck up.

243
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:46,240
But she still is all woman
from there down.

244
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:54,082
I was only trying to
pay her a compliment.

245
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,838
There's nothing wrong in that.

246
00:30:59,597 --> 00:31:04,389
We're going to make a litter
and take her to the cabin in Stump Meadow.

247
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:08,014
I'll ride after Doc Frail and
pass the word that you found her.

248
00:31:08,606 --> 00:31:11,013
Just look here.

249
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:23,737
Maybe she was pretty.

250
00:31:26,624 --> 00:31:29,957
Hey! The lost lady's found!

251
00:31:34,465 --> 00:31:38,878
I found her!
At the canyon.

252
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:40,637
Me! She's alive!

253
00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:49,221
I've found the lady, Doc. I want you to
come right away. She needs you.

254
00:31:49,438 --> 00:31:51,811
I have a patient here.

255
00:31:59,156 --> 00:32:01,694
What's  the red head doing at your place?

256
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:06,405
She's dying. She didn't want to
do it where she works.

257
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:10,699
The Lost Lady is real bad.
They're taking her to Stump Meadow.

258
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,710
I'll be over as quick as I can.

259
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:17,547
- You ain't doing the red head no good, are you?
- No. I guess nobody ever has.

260
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:20,428
But I'm not leaving her now.

261
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:24,670
- How long will you be?
- Couple of hours, maybe.

262
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:29,351
Do you want me to strangle her
to hurry it along?

263
00:32:29,562 --> 00:32:32,729
I don't want nothing from you, Doc.
Nothing at all.

264
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,436
I have done my duty in finding her.
You do yours when you see like it.

265
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:47,446
Glad you're here, Doc.
Let us know how she is, will you?

266
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:55,494
We took turns watching her.

267
00:32:58,215 --> 00:33:01,466
She didn't move once
the whole night.

268
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:05,715
The red head kick off?

269
00:33:06,098 --> 00:33:09,302
Sure glad you got here, Doc.

270
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:13,352
- You own this place?
- Yes.

271
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,529
- Who put the axle grease on her?
- I did.

272
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:29,037
Good. You did right.
Bring the lantern over, Rune.

273
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:37,836
Did it ever occur to you
to clean this place up?

274
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:04,145
I'll need plenty of clean water. Collect it
from the men's canteens. All they can spare.

275
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,991
She's talking to her father.
They killed him in the hold up.

276
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,081
- What's her name?
- Elizabeth Mahler.

277
00:34:19,297 --> 00:34:22,297
That's my canteen, Doc.

278
00:34:29,682 --> 00:34:32,849
[Moaning.]

279
00:34:33,144 --> 00:34:37,355
She's suffering from second
degree burns, exposure

280
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:41,894
and possible concussion.
And she's been blinded.

281
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:47,781
- Will she ever see again?
- It's hard to tell how deep the burn is.

282
00:34:52,038 --> 00:34:56,913
- We have to get her out of this filth.
- Maybe we can borrow this man's wagon.

283
00:34:57,543 --> 00:35:02,004
There's a small summerhouse
right behind the store.

284
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:04,622
You can put her in my place.

285
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:08,293
Okay, I'll get the water.

286
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:12,548
Here's all the water we got.

287
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:16,681
Put it beside the stove,
We'll have to boil it.

288
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,018
All right, get out of here.

289
00:35:21,692 --> 00:35:26,817
Doc, I know you'll be too busy
to take care of her.

290
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:30,067
When I'm done with my chores

291
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:33,369
and she needs somebody
to get her dinner...

292
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:36,249
Maybe I could get it.

293
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,576
Fine, Rune. Thank you.

294
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:52,803
Hey, kid!
Fancy wanting all that water!

295
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:54,640
He's got to wash her, don't he?

296
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:58,096
All over?

297
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:01,605
It's different with doctors.

298
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:09,846
They're bringing in the Lost Lady!

299
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:17,307
They're bringing her in!
Come on!

300
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:35,051
I hear how she's a foreigner.
Is she of loose virtue?

301
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:41,020
What's that mean? She's foreign and
she's blind and she's hurt bad.

302
00:36:55,953 --> 00:37:00,699
Dr. Frail? I think my husband acted
hastily in offering our place.

303
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:04,749
- What if she dies in there?
- She's not going to die.

304
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:19,298
It's going to be all right, Miss.
You're all right now.

305
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,677
We're home now.

[Mumbling]

307
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:44,536
- I do not like this - one bit.
- Let's get back to the store, Edna.

308
00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:13,896
Close the shutters.
This room must be kept dark.

309

Elizabeth. Can you understand me?

310
00:38:26,627 --> 00:38:31,622
The stage was held up.
The horses ran away with you.

311
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:35,755
- But you're safe now.
- Oh, God. You are not my father...

312
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:40,466
-  How's....they are killing him!
- You must remain quiet.

313
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:57,652
I've found some more tea.

314
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:00,278
Add some to the pot.

315
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,999
I never heard of putting
tea on anybody.

316
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,169
Fool book. It says
stupor or semi-consciousness may

317
00:39:13,382 --> 00:39:16,751
be induced by a
sharp blow on the head.

318
00:39:17,178 --> 00:39:22,136
I learned that the first time
I ever fell off a horse.

319
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:27,600
Why don't they try to
learn what happens inside?

320
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:31,016
That's where the
damage is done.

321
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:34,895
Bring the lamp.

322
00:39:51,295 --> 00:39:54,213
She's looking kind
of human.

323
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:58,338
Took us two days. Why can't
we get the canteen?

324
00:39:58,553 --> 00:40:03,974
If you'd gone through what she has,
you wouldn't let go of it either.

325
00:40:08,855 --> 00:40:10,349
She's awake.

326
00:40:13,484 --> 00:40:15,311
Only half awake.

327
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:19,360
The other half
is still somewhere else.

328
00:40:38,843 --> 00:40:41,215
By golly, Doc.

329
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:54,641
I think you can you take
the canteen now.

330
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:05,610
- But she's got a hold of you now, Doc.
- That's all right.

331
00:41:07,246 --> 00:41:10,995
I'll sit here
until she lets go.

332
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:16,623
Go to bed.

333
00:42:04,428 --> 00:42:06,302
Who are you?

334
00:42:06,806 --> 00:42:08,383
I'm a doctor.

335
00:42:08,766 --> 00:42:11,471
Why are my eyes covered?

336
00:42:12,353 --> 00:42:15,105
You've been badly burned
by the sun.

337
00:42:16,524 --> 00:42:18,148
The sun.

338
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:22,855
- Can I see you?
- Not yet.

339
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:27,450
You are temporarily -

340
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,233
remember, temporarily - blind.

341
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:37,495
My father...

342
00:42:38,963 --> 00:42:40,754
...dead, isn't he?

343
00:42:42,884 --> 00:42:44,294
Yes.

344
00:42:45,011 --> 00:42:47,716
He was killed in the hold up.

345
00:42:53,102 --> 00:42:56,471
And he didn't even live
for the payback.

346
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:06,605
Where is he buried?

347
00:43:07,074 --> 00:43:09,482
By the road where it happened.

348
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:13,244
Now I'm going
to get you something to eat.

349
00:43:13,456 --> 00:43:19,245
Don't be frightened of being alone.
My cabin is only a few paces away.

350
00:43:21,422 --> 00:43:25,586
Doctor, is there someone
for me?  A woman?

351
00:43:26,052 --> 00:43:27,463
No.

352
00:43:32,058 --> 00:43:33,635
What am I wearing?

353
00:43:34,018 --> 00:43:36,889
They sent your trunk
and your traffic bag.

354
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:40,687
- I took a nightgown from your trunk.
- Thank you.

355
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:44,352
Don't be disturbed about anything.
I'll take care of you.

356
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,170
- Morning, Rune.
- I was just going to call you to breakfast.

357
00:44:04,382 --> 00:44:07,502
- Got enough for three?
- Sure.

358
00:44:07,718 --> 00:44:09,758
Is she going to be all right?

359
00:44:09,971 --> 00:44:13,470
She'll need quiet and
protection from strangers.

360
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:17,763
Rig that up on the porch
so she can call us.

361
00:44:45,465 --> 00:44:50,257
- Is that all to it, Mr. Flaunce?
- Yes, that's all we've got to ship.

362
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:54,799
- The gold crease petering out?
- Never has been a big strike.

363
00:44:55,016 --> 00:44:59,891
Nobody's had any glory holes here.
Well, good luck!

364
00:45:07,612 --> 00:45:09,651
Good morning, Rune.

365
00:45:10,031 --> 00:45:12,273
Where did you get the horse?

366
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,659
Doc took it in on a fee.

367
00:45:16,621 --> 00:45:19,990
Doc sent me to see
if you got them eggs.

368
00:45:20,374 --> 00:45:22,996
Yeah, I got a dozen and
I saved three for you.

369
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,626
How's the Lost Lady?

370
00:45:31,844 --> 00:45:35,794
She's sitting up for the first time.
but is still weak.

371
00:45:36,015 --> 00:45:40,392
- And still blind?
- The doc says it will take some time yet.

372
00:45:40,895 --> 00:45:44,394
These are mighty precious
this far out.

373
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:48,936
- You tell the Lost Lady we're all pulling for her.
- All right.

374
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,365
That will be $3, pay the missus.

375
00:45:59,205 --> 00:46:02,704
Isn't $3 mighty high for eggs?
That's $1 apiece.

376
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:05,953
That's not bad. They came
all the way from Sour Creek.

377
00:46:06,587 --> 00:46:10,965
I suppose the Doctor's busy with
his various practices up there.

378
00:46:11,342 --> 00:46:12,836
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

379
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:26,813
Well, looks like church!

380
00:46:27,525 --> 00:46:30,692
A few of us women have
decided to see about that girl.

381
00:46:30,903 --> 00:46:34,522
If the Doc wanted help
he'd ask for it.

382
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:39,118
She may be the one who needs help.
She's hardly in the hands of saints.

383
00:46:39,328 --> 00:46:41,487
Edna, don't stick your nose in
where it's not wanted.

384
00:46:41,706 --> 00:46:45,205
If she's decent, she doesn't
belong up there.

385
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:48,834
If she isn't, we'll
soon know.

386
00:46:49,672 --> 00:46:53,836
It was a bad winter.
My mother died that year.

387
00:46:54,052 --> 00:46:57,551
My father said:
''Let's go somewhere else

388
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,730
A place that is new and bright
and not ever hungry.''

389
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:05,556
Oh, it was wonderful.
The steam train to St. Louis.

390
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:09,852
and the steam boat
up the Missouri.

391
00:47:10,068 --> 00:47:14,895
And then the coach over the mountains
and through wide lands.

392
00:47:15,114 --> 00:47:19,860
This was why we
had come so far.

393
00:47:20,244 --> 00:47:22,071
''And now,'' my father said,

394
00:47:22,455 --> 00:47:28,042
''While you're thinking,
try and find the right place''.

395
00:47:28,419 --> 00:47:31,254
Did you think that
this would be the right place?

396
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:34,204
When I can see again,
I'll know.

397
00:47:34,842 --> 00:47:40,429
What you will see is a raw,
wild little gold camp.

398
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,266
The crawling ants here will blow away
with the first wind from the next site.

399
00:47:45,478 --> 00:47:49,013
And you'll see some of
the scum of the world.

400
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:53,728
- Not a place you'd want to live.
- Why are you here? And Rune?

401
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:58,899
- Maybe we belong here.
- I got no place else to be.

402
00:47:59,117 --> 00:48:01,821
Tell me what Rune's like?

403
00:48:02,036 --> 00:48:05,452
And you, Doctor Frail?
What are you like?

404
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:11,413
Rune? He's kind of cross-eyed
and has two thumbs on each hand.

405
00:48:13,548 --> 00:48:17,877
Doc's got a long
gray beard and no teeth.

406
00:48:17,878 --> 00:48:18,260
We're poorly paired.

407
00:48:18,261 --> 00:48:23,421
I know that's not true.
Rune is very handsome.

408
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,884
But it's mainly that I have
no such description at all.

409
00:48:28,771 --> 00:48:31,179
I only know of his hands.

410
00:48:31,816 --> 00:48:35,564
They are burned from the sun
and gentle.

411
00:48:37,363 --> 00:48:43,033
And his legs must be very long because
he crosses the room in 3 steps.

412
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:52,619
We've also got some customers.
Or some fancy visitors.

413
00:48:53,129 --> 00:48:56,332
One of them's the landlady.

414
00:48:59,635 --> 00:49:01,545
What have we here?

415
00:49:01,763 --> 00:49:06,140
- Four ladies in trouble?
- We've come to see Miss Mahler.

416
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:10,644
- Miss Mahler isn't receiving visitors.
- Isn't that for her to say?

417
00:49:10,855 --> 00:49:15,316
No, Miss Mahler is in my care.
Until she's well, that will continue.

418
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:19,643
The decent element of this town...
What are you doing, Doctor?

419
00:49:19,864 --> 00:49:22,533
I'm aiding your departure.

420
00:49:22,742 --> 00:49:25,826
And unless all of you ladies are pregnant
and need my services

421
00:49:26,037 --> 00:49:29,785
I suggest you
mind your own business.

422
00:49:35,254 --> 00:49:40,841
- Am I a prisoner, Rune?
- Doc tells everybody what to do.

423
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:49,386
Rune? Is someone there?

424
00:51:49,847 --> 00:51:53,097
Just good old Frenchy Plante,
come to pay his respects.

425
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:58,849
I'm the one that found you
in the wilderness, remember?

426
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:03,394
I was wondering if you
can spare my canteen.

427
00:52:07,532 --> 00:52:11,446
I'm sorry, I'm
not dressed for company.

428
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:16,074
- Would you mind the door?
- Sure, ma'am. Sure.

429
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,204
Hey!

430
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,838
You almost fell, Lost Lady.

431
00:52:24,298 --> 00:52:27,383
Well, I saved you a
second time!

432
00:52:27,593 --> 00:52:32,137
Well, not that it matters. If I didn't
find you, someone else might have.

433
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:34,471
But then it might
have been too late.

434
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:39,013
- I wish there was something I could do for you.
- As a matter of fact there is.

435
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:43,975
I was just going to ask
if you could help me out.

436
00:52:44,193 --> 00:52:47,562
- What can I do?

437
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:53,700
I've got this spot all
picked out

438
00:52:53,911 --> 00:52:57,909
that looks like it might produce
real color if I could just boost it.

439
00:52:58,124 --> 00:53:00,580
Color?
You are talking about gold?

440
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,124
Gold? Lost Lady, more gold
than anybody has dreamed of!

441
00:53:05,506 --> 00:53:08,507
- How would you like to be rich?
- I would love to be rich.

442
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:13,677
Whoever grubstakes Frenchy,
is going to be mighty lucky.

443
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:19,050
- Grubstake? It means you need money?
- That's right, Lost Lady.

444
00:53:20,355 --> 00:53:25,349
I'm afraid I haven't any.
My father was carrying our money.

445
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:29,815
I would have been happy
to lend you some.

446
00:53:30,782 --> 00:53:33,451
Oh, that don't matter none.

447
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,863
I just came here on
a social call anyway.

448
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:48,047
But maybe you... just a
little kiss, huh?

449
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:50,832
Like what?

450
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:58,093
- Mr. Plante came for his canteen, Doctor.
- Yes, yes.

451
00:54:00,395 --> 00:54:02,968
He has it.

452
00:54:05,066 --> 00:54:09,277
- I'd better be going, ma'am.
- Good night, Mr. Plante.

453
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:25,368
- Are you all right, Elizabeth?
- Yes.

454
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,416
If you don't need anything,
I have some business to attend to.

455
00:54:37,557 --> 00:54:39,217
Rune! Rune!

456
00:54:40,852 --> 00:54:45,679
Fix the warning bell.
It's been cut.

457
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:49,399
From now on, you'll
sleep under her stairs.

458
00:55:15,261 --> 00:55:17,799
Joe!
Stow this behind the bar!

459
00:55:34,948 --> 00:55:40,108
I ain't afraid of you, Doc.
But I ain't packing a gun!

460
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:50,295
I want you all to witness that
I ain't packing a gun!

461
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,676
I just paid a visit to the Lost Lady
and Doc is taking offence.

462
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:06,808
Unclip that razor from your neck
and I'll get rid of this gun.

463
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:14,527
Doc, you mean you'd stoop to dirty
your hands on common folk like me?

464
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,398
Yes.

465
00:57:31,898 --> 00:57:35,481
If I ever find you on this hill again

466
00:57:35,693 --> 00:57:38,528
It makes no difference whether
you're wearing a gun or not...

467
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:41,110
I'll kill you.

468
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:04,302
Now you listen.
I warn you again.

469
00:58:05,098 --> 00:58:08,597
That butcher doctor
is the devil

470
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:11,468
and you must cast him out!

471
00:58:14,315 --> 00:58:19,310
Looks like the doc is going to keep
the little lady all to himself.

472
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:26,111
Kick my dog. It can
sleep around.

473
00:58:26,327 --> 00:58:28,997
Then I kick them back.

474
00:58:30,957 --> 00:58:33,115
With a good friend.

475
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,796
- Did you kill him?
- No.

476
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:44,797
- She said he did nothing to her, Doc.
- I don't care.

477
00:58:45,013 --> 00:58:48,631
- I don't want any of them near her.
- You don't own her, Doc.

478
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:51,300
Is that how it was before?

479
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:56,265
You tried to own somebody
until they hated you?

480
00:58:57,692 --> 00:59:00,479
Go ahead. Hit me!

481
00:59:00,695 --> 00:59:02,901
You own me, Doc!

482
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,627
Close the shutters.

483
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:28,336
To avoid shock to your eyes,
we are darkening the room.

484
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:32,516
Now, sit up and face me.

485
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:40,434
Light the lamp.

486
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:55,287
I have removed
the outer bandage.

487
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,034
Turn the lamp down a little.

488
01:00:06,386 --> 01:00:09,885
Now I am removing
the inner bandage.

489
01:00:13,184 --> 01:00:17,727
Remember, you can't expect
immediate vision.

490
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,358
Now, there are just
the pads over your eyes.

491
01:00:23,236 --> 01:00:26,237
I am going to soften them
with cool water.

492
01:00:29,033 --> 01:00:31,524
Turn the lamp very low, Rune.

493
01:00:32,704 --> 01:00:35,373
Now bring it over
to my right.

494
01:00:39,586 --> 01:00:42,255
Ready, Elizabeth?

495
01:00:43,882 --> 01:00:46,337
Pray for me, Doctor.

496
01:00:48,303 --> 01:00:50,876
Hold the lamp high, Rune.

497
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,929
Open your eyes.

498
01:01:07,947 --> 01:01:10,154
Can you see anything?

499
01:01:14,454 --> 01:01:16,493
No.

500
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,916
Move the lamp from
right to left.

501
01:01:34,849 --> 01:01:36,343
Nothing.

502
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:41,471
Not quite nothing, Elizabeth.
Your eyes are following the lamp.

503
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,272
- Tell me what you see.
- Please, Lady. Try.

504
01:01:52,825 --> 01:01:57,902
- I see a little light moving through a fog.
- A little light? That's a lot.

505
01:01:58,289 --> 01:02:01,705
That's more than
most of us see.

506
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:05,455
And tomorrow you'll see much more.

507
01:02:11,636 --> 01:02:14,092
I can not see anyone.

508
01:02:15,181 --> 01:02:18,052
I love you first.

509
01:03:29,797 --> 01:03:31,624
What's wrong?

510
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:34,166
My eyes! They
are hurting me!

511
01:03:34,385 --> 01:03:36,959
Her eyes hurt.

512
01:03:37,597 --> 01:03:40,005
They burn! Like fire!

513
01:03:40,391 --> 01:03:42,384
When did this begin?

514
01:03:42,602 --> 01:03:47,762
It got dark again.

515
01:03:47,982 --> 01:03:51,316
I'm blind again!
I know it!

516
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,189
Go to the cabin.

517
01:03:54,072 --> 01:03:57,690
- Let me see your eyes.
- No!

518
01:03:58,076 --> 01:04:01,030
Let me see your eyes.

519
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:08,700
Suppose we go outside
and try again.

520
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,957
- No.
- Why not?

521
01:04:12,173 --> 01:04:15,673
There was a stagecoach.

522
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:18,127
One of the red men
was shooting.

523
01:04:18,346 --> 01:04:22,510
- I'm blind again.
- Your eyes are all right.

524
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:50,128
Take your hands down.

525
01:04:55,133 --> 01:04:57,339
Now listen to me.

526
01:04:57,552 --> 01:05:02,344
If you keep your eyes closed,
you'll think from the sounds

527
01:05:02,557 --> 01:05:04,431
that the world is falling on you.

528
01:05:04,642 --> 01:05:09,221
But if you open your eyes and look,
you'll see things as they are.

529
01:05:11,316 --> 01:05:13,143
I can not.

530
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:19,521
Now I'm going to leave you here.
You are on the edge of a cliff.

531
01:05:19,741 --> 01:05:21,698
I don't advise you
to go through life

532
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:25,724
with your eyes closed.

533
01:06:25,473 --> 01:06:27,300
She's all right.

534
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,844
She's free now.

535
01:07:17,275 --> 01:07:19,944
Thought I told you
to go up on the hill.

536
01:07:21,321 --> 01:07:23,776
I'm not going
until you go.

537
01:07:26,701 --> 01:07:29,785
Well, it's going to be
quite a wait.

538
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:34,826
Listen, Doc.

539
01:07:35,794 --> 01:07:40,087
She spent all afternoon picking out
supper for us. You know that.

540
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,797
Give her my apologies and
tell her I'm busy here.

541
01:07:46,012 --> 01:07:48,681
You just can't treat
her that way.

542
01:07:49,641 --> 01:07:52,891
You're minding my
business too much.

543
01:07:53,103 --> 01:07:56,970
Aren't you a little confused
about who owns who?

544
01:08:02,821 --> 01:08:04,481
Cards, Doc?

545
01:08:05,406 --> 01:08:07,233
Do you want cards?

546
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:10,446
Yes.

547
01:08:33,226 --> 01:08:37,140
- We were waiting for you.
- I'm sorry I couldn't come.

548
01:08:37,522 --> 01:08:40,891
Are you afraid of me,
because I'm well now?

549
01:08:41,276 --> 01:08:44,645
No, I'm glad you're well.

550
01:08:45,029 --> 01:08:47,865
If you'll excuse me,
I'll say good night.

551
01:09:05,258 --> 01:09:09,587
- You shouldn't have come in here.
- I know.

552
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:33,905
Go back to your own cabin. You're getting
out of here tomorrow on the stagecoach.

553
01:09:34,287 --> 01:09:36,908
Where should I go?

554
01:09:37,123 --> 01:09:40,575
New York. Back to Switzerland. Wherever people
go when they've come the wrong way.

555
01:09:40,794 --> 01:09:44,245
- What would I do there?
- You have relatives.

556
01:09:44,464 --> 01:09:48,129
There's no one here to look after you.
There is no place you here.

557
01:09:48,343 --> 01:09:50,632
There's no way
you can make a living.

558
01:09:50,845 --> 01:09:52,802
Why do you do this?

559
01:09:53,681 --> 01:09:57,347
Because you have to go.
And because I intend to stay.

560
01:09:59,572 --> 01:10:02,522
Why do you do this?
Don't send me away.

561
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:07,979
You’ll be packed in the morning
and I'll take you to the stage.

562
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:12,523
No, you won’t.

563
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:17,867
And you will not again
tell me what to do or not.

564
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:21,331
I will not take the coach
in the morning.

565
01:10:21,543 --> 01:10:25,291
I came to make
this my home.

566
01:10:25,505 --> 01:10:27,332
And I will do it.

567
01:10:30,009 --> 01:10:33,010
In 6 weeks, this could be a ghost
town, with no-one left in it.

568
01:10:34,514 --> 01:10:36,174
I'll be here!

569
01:10:36,391 --> 01:10:40,887
I’ll plant ghost wheat
and raise ghost cattle.

570
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:44,555
- And watch when I build my ghost house!
- With ghost money?

571
01:10:44,983 --> 01:10:49,027
I will get some money.
Somehow I will.

572
01:10:49,571 --> 01:10:54,197
Even if it’s only to pay you
for your services, Doctor.

573
01:11:10,175 --> 01:11:14,303
I’ll cover you for that bullet
you’ve been holding on me.

574
01:11:14,512 --> 01:11:17,182
Oh, I threw that away
a long time ago.

575
01:11:19,267 --> 01:11:20,761
You threw it away?

576
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:24,477
You mean I’ve been working
for you and didn’t have to?

577
01:11:26,066 --> 01:11:29,020
- Looks that way.
- I'm free too?

578
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:36,198
You're the damndest, contraryest
human being I have ever seen.

579
01:11:36,409 --> 01:11:37,405
Rune?

580
01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:42,162
You better keep the old gray, too,
so you and the lady won't be afoot.

581
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:49,543
Good morning. My name is
Elizabeth Mahler. Thank you very much.

582
01:11:54,386 --> 01:11:57,470
Hey, Rune.
Is that the Lost Lady?

583
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,800
- My name is Elizabeth Mahler.
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

584
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:02,013
Thank you very much.

585
01:12:11,986 --> 01:12:14,608
- Welcome to Skull Creek, ma'am.
- Thank you.

586
01:12:14,823 --> 01:12:18,488
You're a strange lady. You like
to talk to them strangers.

587
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:23,031
They speak and I speak back.
Good morning.

588
01:12:24,165 --> 01:12:27,369
- Allow me, Lost Lady.
- We don't need no help!

589
01:12:27,585 --> 01:12:31,001
Thank you very much.
My name is Elizabeth Mahler.

590
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:34,665
- Come on in before you start a riot.
- It's a great pleasure, madam.

591
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:40,378
Good morning.

592
01:12:44,811 --> 01:12:47,302
- Are you Mrs. Flaunce?
- Yes I am.

593
01:12:47,522 --> 01:12:51,389
- I'd like to talk to your husband.
- I'm here, Miss Mahler.

594
01:12:52,444 --> 01:12:55,195
Thank you.

595
01:12:57,949 --> 01:12:59,360
How do you do.

596
01:12:59,576 --> 01:13:03,075
Rune tells me that you have been
very kind to me when I was found.

597
01:13:03,371 --> 01:13:05,993
Nice to see you
up and around.

598
01:13:06,374 --> 01:13:09,874
Thank you.
I would like a grubstake.

599
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,914
What did you say?

600
01:13:12,297 --> 01:13:15,463
Rune and I
want to dig for gold.

601
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:19,510
I see. Isn't it unusual
for a lady?

602
01:13:19,721 --> 01:13:23,801
- I'll be right with her.
- I'm not afraid of hard work.

603
01:13:24,017 --> 01:13:27,267
Would you lend me
a grubstake on this?

604
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:31,311
It is worth much money.
It is a family heirloom.

605
01:13:32,901 --> 01:13:36,067
The stones are very regal.

606
01:13:42,869 --> 01:13:47,864
This is a very interesting piece.
I have a jeweller’s glass in the back room.

607
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:51,831
Do you mind if I take a look
at it through that?

608
01:13:51,945 --> 01:13:54,400
No, of course not.

609
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:10,436
- Doc, they want a grubstake.
- That's what I thought.

610
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:15,605
She wants to borrow money on
this. She says it's an heirloom.

611
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:18,689
Looks to me like
it's not worth $20.

612
01:14:19,197 --> 01:14:23,147
Tell her it's worth
whatever they want.

613
01:14:23,368 --> 01:14:27,366
All right, Doc.
Seeing as you're paying for it.

614
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:46,385
Old Frenchy wasn't lying!

615
01:14:46,599 --> 01:14:50,431
If you just give me the money,
I'll start the development.

616
01:14:50,645 --> 01:14:54,346
No, first we must
discuss the agreement.

617
01:14:54,566 --> 01:14:58,813
It's embarrassing talking business
with a lady, especially a pretty lady.

618
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:02,695
- Mr. Plante, tell us everything about this claim.
- Good point.

619
01:15:02,907 --> 01:15:04,532
All right.

620
01:15:04,909 --> 01:15:09,370
How about 20% of everything?
I can't be more generous than that.

621
01:15:09,831 --> 01:15:14,292
I can get a grubstake
at any time for 5 or 10%.

622
01:15:14,669 --> 01:15:17,077
Why didn't you?

623
01:15:19,424 --> 01:15:21,582
No, I don't think 20% will do.

624
01:15:22,177 --> 01:15:24,004
We want 50%.

625
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:28,504
- Now, take it or go with it.
- Or leave it.

626
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:30,219
Yes, or leave it.

627
01:15:30,852 --> 01:15:32,928
- 50%.
- 50%.

628
01:15:35,023 --> 01:15:38,190
Just for you, ma'am, I go with it.
You want to shake on it?

629
01:15:38,443 --> 01:15:42,904
No, we just to Mr. Flaunce
and write out our agreement

630
01:15:43,114 --> 01:15:47,064
And then we will shake hands.

631
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:56,085
''... it is agreed that should
any co-locator withdraw

632
01:15:56,294 --> 01:16:00,921
from sharing in and the
working of said claim... ''

633
01:16:03,134 --> 01:16:04,629
Whoa!

634
01:16:06,513 --> 01:16:09,514
I set the sluice
up there at the waterfall,

635
01:16:09,724 --> 01:16:12,927
aim her down past the tree
into the creek.

636
01:16:13,478 --> 01:16:15,886
I'll start cutting brush.

637
01:16:16,106 --> 01:16:18,182
Well, Lucky Lady?
If you just

638
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,729
sit in the shade, old
Frenchy will unload the wagon.

639
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:27,738
Mr. Plante, I will do my share of the work
if you would treat me as a man.

640
01:16:28,827 --> 01:16:31,911
That ain't gonna be easy.

641
01:16:32,998 --> 01:16:37,624
It will be easy if you find something to do with
your hands besides putting them on me.

642
01:16:41,423 --> 01:16:46,548
You're something, you know that?
You're really something!

643
01:17:00,859 --> 01:17:03,895
Go up and start
cutting sluice lumber.

644
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:51,148
Rune!  Get up there
with the water!

645
01:18:12,681 --> 01:18:16,346
Now we're ready
to start washing dirt.

646
01:18:17,519 --> 01:18:19,844
Let her come!

647
01:18:36,204 --> 01:18:38,909
Now we can start digging gold.

648
01:18:39,124 --> 01:18:42,290
Now we can tear out the gold
that's been behind a shield

649
01:18:42,502 --> 01:18:46,452
for over a million million years.

650
01:18:53,013 --> 01:18:56,263
10 yards of towelling.
Who's having a baby?

651
01:18:56,474 --> 01:18:58,467
Wonder Russell's wife.

652
01:18:58,685 --> 01:19:04,024
Well, if I know her she'll cause trouble.
You'd better take 12.

653
01:19:05,442 --> 01:19:09,570
Listen, have you heard anything
from up the river?

654
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:11,902
You aren't getting lonesome,
are you, Doc?

655
01:19:12,115 --> 01:19:15,614
No, I just wanted to know
how things are going.

656
01:19:15,827 --> 01:19:18,994
- Well, they got the sluice in.
- Get anything out?

657
01:19:19,748 --> 01:19:21,787
Kind of a let down.

658
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,950
Only 5 ounces in 3 weeks.
Kind of slim return on your money.

659
01:19:27,172 --> 01:19:29,081
It takes time.

660
01:19:29,299 --> 01:19:32,216
They're into your account
for over  $1,000.

661
01:19:32,427 --> 01:19:36,092
- You want me to go on giving her whatever she wants?
- Yes.

662
01:19:36,306 --> 01:19:41,134
- Even if it's a bust?
- Even if it's a total bust.

663
01:19:42,854 --> 01:19:45,096
I don't pry into folk's affairs.

664
01:19:45,315 --> 01:19:50,024
But as a business man I don't understand
what you're trying to prove.

665
01:19:50,236 --> 01:19:54,815
Seeing as I'm not a businessman, Tom,
I don't have to justify my reasons.

666
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:59,033
Thanks for
keeping it confidential.

667
01:19:59,245 --> 01:20:01,571
I haven't even told the wife.

668
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:05,787
I promised Wonder
I'd stay up with him.

669
01:20:06,002 --> 01:20:10,498
He's more scared than his wife.
Funny about a man.

670
01:20:10,715 --> 01:20:15,626
Funny that the woman got
such a hold on him.

671
01:20:49,754 --> 01:20:54,500
Don't avoid that dog leg.
Over the ridge and down along the creek.

672
01:21:22,888 --> 01:21:26,755
Here a solid month
and not one full poke to show for it.

673
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:30,753
I never had any luck. Always
on the outside looking in!

674
01:21:30,754 --> 01:21:35,463
- We have to be patient.
- Patience is something I'm fresh out of.

675
01:22:18,009 --> 01:22:22,588
Hello, Doctor. I wondered
when you would come to see.

676
01:22:22,973 --> 01:22:25,261
I had to make a call
up the canyon.

677
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:31,312
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.

678
01:22:41,992 --> 01:22:43,320
Thank you.

679
01:22:47,497 --> 01:22:50,996
Doesn't a doctor always say
''How are you feeling?''

680
01:22:51,209 --> 01:22:53,831
And: ''Stick out your tongue''?

681
01:22:54,045 --> 01:22:56,287
I can see how you are.

682
01:22:58,258 --> 01:23:00,085
Am I well?

683
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:06,385
- Let me see your hands.
- They're dirty.

684
01:23:09,961 --> 01:23:13,391
Perhaps I should ask
how are you? Are you well?

685
01:23:14,482 --> 01:23:20,022
The next time you're in town stop by
and I'll give you something for your hands.

686
01:23:23,617 --> 01:23:25,075
Thank you, Doctor.

687
01:23:27,537 --> 01:23:30,242
"Lucky Lady".
Is it lucky?

688
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:34,908
Not yet, but it doesn't hurt to hope.

689
01:23:35,795 --> 01:23:37,373
I suppose Rune is fine?

690
01:23:38,465 --> 01:23:40,457
We both miss you, Doctor.

691
01:23:53,313 --> 01:23:56,848
What are you doing?
Spying on us?

692
01:23:57,901 --> 01:24:01,104
What is there he shouldn't see?

693
01:24:24,553 --> 01:24:26,047
Rune?

694
01:24:39,901 --> 01:24:41,645
Rune! Get back to work!

695
01:24:42,028 --> 01:24:44,650
I only own 50% of this hole

696
01:24:44,865 --> 01:24:48,399
and I ain't digging more
than 50% of this dirt!

697
01:24:59,629 --> 01:25:02,334
Why don't we quit?

698
01:25:02,549 --> 01:25:06,381
You can. But if you do the claim
belongs to Rune and me.

699
01:25:06,595 --> 01:25:09,465
You want my share?
I'll sell cheap.

700
01:25:09,681 --> 01:25:13,548
And I ask you why would Mr. Plante
have so much money

701
01:25:13,768 --> 01:25:16,306
if it wasn't a wonderful claim?

702
01:25:30,911 --> 01:25:33,615
Do you always look
at a woman like that?

703
01:25:33,997 --> 01:25:39,240
A partner has some rights, eh?
Don't even get a free look?

704
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:42,545
I suppose you gotta be
a doctor to get that.

705
01:25:42,756 --> 01:25:47,334
I suppose a doctor
could get an eyeful.

706
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:03,274
I liked that real well.

707
01:26:04,152 --> 01:26:05,860
Wait.

708
01:26:06,071 --> 01:26:08,478
That's better than nothing.

709
01:26:16,373 --> 01:26:17,867
Rune!

710
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:22,453
I'm going into town to get supplies.
I want you to come with me.

711
01:26:22,671 --> 01:26:26,799
You don't have to go.
There's no panic.

712
01:26:27,259 --> 01:26:29,500
I'll see you tomorrow, Frenchy.

713
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:33,386
After this I'm going to spend
my nights in town

714
01:26:33,598 --> 01:26:35,970
and work here days only.

715
01:26:42,148 --> 01:26:43,975
I'm poison, eh?

716
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,188
Poison, eh.

717
01:26:50,574 --> 01:26:53,824
Just a moment, and
I'll get you your change.

718
01:26:56,788 --> 01:26:58,532
Good evening.

719
01:26:58,915 --> 01:27:02,747
Good evening, Mrs. Flaunce.
We are just about out of everything

720
01:27:02,919 --> 01:27:06,502
and I'm sorry to ask you for
another advance on my pin.

721
01:27:06,882 --> 01:27:11,460
Your pin? Your priceless pin?
That pin wasn't worth a sack of potatoes.

722
01:27:15,473 --> 01:27:17,550
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what you mean.

723
01:27:17,767 --> 01:27:19,974
I came across your
private accounts.

724
01:27:20,187 --> 01:27:22,808
That pin ain't down
for two cents.

725
01:27:23,732 --> 01:27:27,682
- What do you mean?
- Stop the innocent lady act.

726
01:27:27,903 --> 01:27:32,280
In plain tongue, Dr. Frail has been
paying your way from the start.

727
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:37,034
And ain't none of us has to ask
how you've been paying him back.

728
01:27:37,621 --> 01:27:40,159
It's all down in black and white:

729
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:45,416
$ 1119 worth you're being kept.
That's being private!

730
01:28:08,068 --> 01:28:12,895
Liar. Stupid female snake.
You ain't fit to crawl.

731
01:28:26,378 --> 01:28:29,960
Some how, some way
I pay every cent of it back.

732
01:28:30,173 --> 01:28:33,091
- Pay what back?
- I was in the store.

733
01:28:33,301 --> 01:28:38,047
Mrs. Flaunce says you were keeping me.
She even called me a whore.

734
01:28:38,557 --> 01:28:41,890
I didn't want that to happen.
I'm sorry.

735
01:28:42,144 --> 01:28:46,640
- I can still arrange for you to leave.
- You have arranged enough!

736
01:28:47,023 --> 01:28:50,938
What makes you think you
can play with people's lives?

737
01:28:51,153 --> 01:28:54,818
It is very cruel the way you throw
women away if they get too close.

738
01:28:55,198 --> 01:28:59,030
- You like them closer?
- No I don't.

739
01:28:59,244 --> 01:29:02,613
But you do! You do it to
Rune! You do it to me.

740
01:29:02,831 --> 01:29:07,707
- Someday life will do it to you.
- How do you know it hasn't?

741
01:29:08,795 --> 01:29:11,630
Then it's true the story
they tell about you.

742
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,834
- And the woman who killed herself.
- Yes, it's true.

743
01:29:21,141 --> 01:29:25,886
The woman was my wife.
And the man was my brother.

744
01:29:26,271 --> 01:29:29,106
And I have no right to forget.

745
01:29:36,323 --> 01:29:39,027
You want to tell me why?

746
01:29:42,954 --> 01:29:47,782
This is a tincture of benzoin ointment.
I made it up for your hands.

747
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:51,915
It will heal them and
toughen them, too.

748
01:30:22,702 --> 01:30:26,700
I'm done! I'm through!
I can't take this no more!

749
01:30:27,124 --> 01:30:30,327
But them nuggets you found
must come from some place!

750
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:36,713
Some place, yeah! It was probably
left here by that flood in the Bible!

751
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:45,930
- What's that?
- Listen!

752
01:30:50,647 --> 01:30:52,889
Feel the ground move?

753
01:30:53,108 --> 01:30:55,147
Run, the tree!

754
01:31:22,554 --> 01:31:24,463
- Rune!
- Here I am!

755
01:31:25,891 --> 01:31:27,551
- Rune!

756
01:31:27,934 --> 01:31:30,093
- It's gold!
- What is it?

757
01:31:30,312 --> 01:31:31,806
Gold.

758
01:31:33,565 --> 01:31:37,064
The roots of this tree has
been hanging on to them.

759
01:31:37,444 --> 01:31:40,445
Sluice is busted.
Clean in two.

760
01:31:41,239 --> 01:31:46,067
Where are you?

761
01:31:46,068 --> 01:31:48,388
What are you doing in that hole?

762
01:31:51,124 --> 01:31:52,618
Look.

763
01:31:54,878 --> 01:31:56,456
It's a glory hole?

764
01:31:57,589 --> 01:32:01,338
Look. Look!

765
01:32:01,551 --> 01:32:05,549
It's a glory hole!

766
01:32:05,931 --> 01:32:07,970
- Look!
- It's a glory hole!

767
01:32:17,526 --> 01:32:19,649
Glory hole!

768
01:32:20,278 --> 01:32:22,070
Glory hole!

769
01:32:32,499 --> 01:32:34,741
Glory hole!

770
01:32:39,756 --> 01:32:44,418
The Lucky Lady and me,
we've got the gold!

771
01:32:44,636 --> 01:32:49,796
We've got the deepest, biggest, glory hole
in the history of the territory!

772
01:32:50,183 --> 01:32:53,718
How's that?

773
01:32:54,438 --> 01:32:56,596
Yeah!

774
01:33:02,737 --> 01:33:06,356
Tomorrow I'll put the mine first.

775
01:33:06,575 --> 01:33:09,860
But tonight Frenchy's throwing the biggest
party in the history of the territory!

776
01:33:10,245 --> 01:33:13,910
- Yeah!

777
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:20,083
We've got tons of it!
It's running out of our ears!

778
01:33:20,297 --> 01:33:25,089
Lady Luck! Rub some
of it off on me!

779
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:31,807
No, no, not all of them.
I want them to take home.

780
01:33:32,184 --> 01:33:34,307
That's all right, partner.

781
01:33:39,675 --> 01:33:43,395
I'm high grading a couple
 of big sacks for myself.

782
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:44,620
Do what you want.

783
01:33:44,721 --> 01:33:49,299
All those in favor of busting
this place wide open, follow me!

784
01:34:00,962 --> 01:34:03,204
Come on, guys! Come on!

785
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:14,724
Frenchy is buying the store.

786
01:34:15,102 --> 01:34:18,352
Free drinks for the whole 
of Montana all day!

787
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:22,348
Give us bottles!

788
01:34:32,411 --> 01:34:37,487
Remember last Saturday night?
No pay no play?

789
01:34:37,707 --> 01:34:41,290
What a difference a
little gold makes, eh?

790
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:51,133
- I still think it safer with Flaunce.
- I want it here.

791
01:34:51,346 --> 01:34:54,762
Well, this will be quite a night!

792
01:34:54,975 --> 01:34:58,973
Now you know why they hunt
for it or kill for it.

793
01:34:59,187 --> 01:35:00,598
Yes, now I do.

794
01:35:00,814 --> 01:35:04,646
- You'll never be poor again.
- No.

795
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:07,814
I wish Doc was here.

796
01:35:08,321 --> 01:35:12,402
Go and get dressed and
cleaned up so we can celebrate.

797
01:35:33,305 --> 01:35:37,967
Burn them stinking clothes.
Burn them! Burn them!

798
01:35:38,685 --> 01:35:42,813
Bring a bonfire!
Celebrate!

799
01:36:21,812 --> 01:36:25,940
Frenchy, you ought to see this fire.

800
01:36:43,291 --> 01:36:45,201
Is Doc Frail around?

801
01:36:45,419 --> 01:36:48,870
Mine caved in up at Dry Canyon.
He left yesterday.

802
01:36:50,132 --> 01:36:51,840
Caved in, eh?

803
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:55,668
What we do is kind of a joke see.

804
01:37:11,778 --> 01:37:14,103
Bucket brigade!

805
01:37:14,322 --> 01:37:16,066
Bucket brigade!

806
01:37:18,243 --> 01:37:19,986
Bucket brigade!

807
01:37:20,203 --> 01:37:21,947
Bucket brigade!

808
01:38:01,703 --> 01:38:06,745
Hey Doc, is that you?
Did you hear the big news?

809
01:38:07,292 --> 01:38:09,119
What do you want?

810
01:38:09,419 --> 01:38:13,334
- Doc's not back yet.
- Just dropped in to wet your tonsils.

811
01:38:13,715 --> 01:38:18,591
Thanks, I'm not drinking.
I'm going to a party.

812
01:38:28,271 --> 01:38:32,400
- What's going on?
- The party's already started, son.

813
01:38:38,615 --> 01:38:41,450
I brought you flowers.

814
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,868
They're very nice.

815
01:38:45,288 --> 01:38:49,867
I guess you wouldn't want to
wear them with the roots, eh?

816
01:38:49,868 --> 01:38:50,148
No.

817
01:38:52,129 --> 01:38:55,414
Would you please go, Frenchy?

818
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:04,801
Why?

819
01:39:05,058 --> 01:39:09,554
I'll be ready in just a few moments.
Then we'll get Rune and celebrate.

820
01:39:09,771 --> 01:39:12,689
Why go?
You and me are partners.

821
01:39:12,899 --> 01:39:18,735
You and me can have
our party right here...

822
01:39:19,448 --> 01:39:21,773
Let's drink first.

823
01:39:30,042 --> 01:39:31,868
Come to Frenchy.

824
01:39:33,837 --> 01:39:37,087
Or do you want
Frenchy to come to you?

825
01:39:37,299 --> 01:39:39,422
Either way, Frenchy is willing!

826
01:40:08,622 --> 01:40:12,536
His house! The butcher
doctor's house!

827
01:40:33,563 --> 01:40:36,315
- Where's Elizabeth and Rune?
- Right up on the hill.

828
01:40:36,525 --> 01:40:39,976
That crazy Grubb has been screaming
to set fire to your place.

829
01:40:42,906 --> 01:40:45,575
Frenchy has waited long enough.

830
01:42:18,835 --> 01:42:21,243
Murderer! Butcher!

831
01:42:22,047 --> 01:42:26,625
Lynch him!
Nail him to the tree!

832
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,635
Lynch him!

833
01:42:40,607 --> 01:42:41,936
Rune!

834
01:43:41,376 --> 01:43:45,125
They say this is a real humane
way to kill you, Frail.

835
01:43:45,339 --> 01:43:48,209
The wagon gets pulled out
from under you... simple as that.

836
01:43:48,759 --> 01:43:52,009
Say the word, Grubb.

837
01:43:52,929 --> 01:43:55,800
Blood will have blood. And
whosoever sheddeth man's blood

838
01:43:56,016 --> 01:44:01,472
by man shall blood be shed.
Genesis, 9th Chapter, 6th verse.

839
01:44:10,072 --> 01:44:12,111
Go back!

840
01:44:20,791 --> 01:44:23,033
You can have our gold.

841
01:44:23,251 --> 01:44:26,336
You can have everything
we have.

842
01:44:26,546 --> 01:44:30,081
Rune is my partner.
He agrees.

843
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:34,428
Please take it.
There's bags of gold.

844
01:44:34,805 --> 01:44:37,925
There is so much.
Please take it.

845
01:44:39,559 --> 01:44:42,430
You. Please take it.

846
01:44:47,567 --> 01:44:50,652
You can even have our claim.

847
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:55,029
Here it is.

848
01:44:55,492 --> 01:44:58,943
You know what it means.
Please take it.

849
01:45:01,415 --> 01:45:03,324
Please take it.

850
01:45:04,334 --> 01:45:06,291
Rune.

851
01:45:07,212 --> 01:45:11,340
Know what?
She's trying to buy her man.

852
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:13,708
She wants him that bad.
Let her have him.

853
01:45:14,094 --> 01:45:17,297
Frenchy said
it was worth a million.

854
01:46:06,688 --> 01:46:08,645
Elizabeth.

855
01:46:09,305 --> 01:47:09,513

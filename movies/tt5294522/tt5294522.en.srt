[woman narrating] <i>This is
my half-brother's story.</i>

5
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,009
<i>I tell it because
it's all I can do</i>

6
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,011
<i>with the way
things turned out.</i>

7
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,251
<i>Eugene left me with something more
important than any of the facts.</i>

8
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:12,223
<i>Now, first thing people
get wrong about his story</i>

9
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:14,158
<i>is the beginning.</i>

10
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,961
<i>It didn't start
with the Wells lady.</i>

11
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:21,198
<i>It started with the first
train full of homesteaders.</i>

12
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:27,637
<i>Amongst the heartbroken fearful
who arrived in Bismark on that day</i>

13
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:33,210
<i>were John, Olivia
and Eugene Baker.</i>

14
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,813
<i>The Bakers had moved
their lives West</i>

15
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:39,383
<i>into the Great Plains,
on a promise.</i>

16
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:44,754
<i>A promise that now looked as
rotten as the dirt they stood on.</i>

17
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:50,161
<i>They prayed for rain and began to
build a new life up from scratch.</i>

18
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,265
<i>But John wasn't convinced.</i>

19
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,203
<i>He believed there was something
cursed about this land.</i>

20
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:04,607
<i>Over the next years,
John's drinking worsened...</i>

21
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,743
- [shouting]
- <i>...and he became paranoid.</i>

22
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,913
<i>His mind filled with visions
of some other life...</i>

23
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:13,350
<i>where he could live
in God's grace again.</i>

24
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:17,887
<i>And just like that,
when Eugene was five years old,</i>

25
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:20,824
- <i>he lost his father.</i>
- You're just leaving?

26
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:27,231
<i>An absence was created that would
haunt him for the rest of his life.</i>

27
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,603
<i>Eugene only ever got
one postcard from his father.</i>

28
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,208
<i>In it, John claimed
he had found the eye of God</i>

29
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,776
<i>in the most beautiful place
on Earth,</i>

30
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:43,147
<i>the Gulf Coast of Mexico.</i>

31
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:48,185
<i>Olivia quickly tried to fill
that absence in Eugene's life,</i>

32
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,155
<i>and a year later
she married George Evans,</i>

33
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:55,392
<i>a county deputy, farmer
and my father.</i>

34
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,262
<i>But John Baker
and the world he wrote about</i>

35
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:00,930
<i>were never far
from my brother's mind.</i>

36
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:06,270
<i>He wondered what his father
had really found out there.</i>

37
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:12,842
<i>Then, when Eugene was 17,</i>

38
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:15,412
<i>something else
took his attention.</i>

39
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:18,015
[wind howling]

40
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:21,018
<i>All of ours, for that matter.</i>

41
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,093
<i>Just like the curse John had spoken
of, the land turned on us.</i>

42
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:33,497
[man] <i>My fellow Americans,
I have been on a journey to nine states.</i>

43
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:36,167
[narrator] <i>Fourteen storms
hit Bismark in the first year.</i>

44
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,570
[man] <i>I saw a group of families
who had lost their wheat crops,</i>

45
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:41,238
<i>lost their corn crops,</i>

46
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:43,407
<i>basically withered
without food.</i>

47
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,909
[narrator] <i>The more we
tried to start over,</i>

48
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:47,710
<i>the worse they got.</i>

49
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:49,913
<i>And the banks came
for Bismark.</i>

50
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:57,288
<i>Crazy preachers would scream
about God and salvation,</i>

51
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:00,357
<i>while families did the only
thing they still could...</i>

52
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,791
[indistinct prayers]

53
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:04,995
<i>...until they couldn't even
do that anymore.</i>

54
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,301
<i>Eugene hid away
in the abandoned family barn.</i>

55
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,504
<i>He would daydream
about his destiny,</i>

56
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:16,440
<i>fantasizing about a life
like his heroes...</i>

57
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:18,108
- [gunfire]
- [screaming]

58
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:21,145
<i>...the outlaws and
adventurers he read about.</i>

59
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,183
- Phoebe, come back here!
- [Phoebe laughing]

60
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:30,120
[adult Phoebe] <i>I suppose no one
warned Eugene about what can happen</i>

61
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:32,456
<i>when you dream about
something so much.</i>

62
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,766
<i>That's how Allison Wells
entered this story...</i>

63
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,605
[siren wailing]

64
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:49,806
<i>...like a bat out of hell...</i>

65
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,142
<i>headed straight...</i>

66
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,579
<i>for my brother.</i>

67
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,181
[indistinct chattering]

68
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:59,116
[rooster crows]

69
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:13,830
Roadblock for me,
would you?

70
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,920
Look at this cold bastard.

71
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:40,890
I bet he'd be in bed with a different
broad every night if he were real.

72
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:45,763
I bet he knows exactly the right thing
to say to a girl to make her crazy.

73
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,299
That's all it takes really...
words.

74
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,634
Unless you live in a
dead old town like this.

75
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,902
- Amen to that.
- [chuckles]

76
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,205
Hey, what's going on?

77
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:57,474
[man] Harold,
he'll tell you all about it.

78
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,043
- Check it out?
- Mm-hmm.

79
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:02,012
[man] All right, folks, we got
some things need to be said.

80
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:04,782
So, y'all quiet down now
so that they can be heard.

81
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,016
- [man 1 shushing]
- [man 2] Ma'am?

82
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,385
During their raid
on a Missouri bank,

83
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,189
the thief and murderer,
Allison Wells,

84
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,758
sent a nine-year-old
little girl to heaven.

85
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:17,361
- [crowd gasps and murmurs]
- Nine years old.

86
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:20,564
And that was just
one of five human souls

87
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:22,899
that were taken on that day.

88
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,670
If you see this woman,

89
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,105
do not confront her.

90
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:32,242
She will not hesitate
to take another life.

91
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:34,478
Now, all and all,
she's just one little lady

92
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,115
with half the Texas law
enforcement trying to find her.

93
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,217
And find her we shall.

94
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:42,720
Is this real, this reward?

95
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:45,356
Ten thousand dollars
if we find her?

96
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,460
You're Deputy Evans' boy,
ain't you?

97
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:52,329
Yes, sir.
He's my stepfather.

98
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:54,998
Well, I appreciate
your interest, son,

99
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,000
but we've already got
all the help we need

100
00:06:57,134 --> 00:07:00,170
from the Evans family,
so just run on home.

101
00:07:01,772 --> 00:07:04,907
[man] Search party meeting
at church after the service.

102
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:07,644
God and coincidence

103
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:10,214
cannot occupy the same Earth.

104
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,149
We know this,
ladies and gentlemen,

105
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:16,153
for where there is a sign,
there is the hand of God.

106
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:19,957
And our community
is under his palm now.

107
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,592
And now we see why...

108
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,794
women like Allison Wells...

109
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:27,164
[chattering]

110
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,898
Eugene.

111
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:35,339
[scoffs] What a drag.

112
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,674
Ready to go?

113
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,611
Eugene?

114
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:43,013
Hey, Joe.

115
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:46,916
- I want you at home today.
- Why?

116
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,519
With that Wells lady
on the loose,

117
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:50,920
it's not safe
around these parts.

118
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,557
We're going with
the search party, Ma.

119
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,225
We'll be safe.

120
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,529
We'll look after
each other, all right?

121
00:07:58,662 --> 00:07:59,797
You have my word.

122
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,931
Mmm, home by dark.

123
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,933
- Yes, ma'am.
- And stick together.

124
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,369
Give me that.

125
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:07,638
- Can I come?
- No, you cannot.

126
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,440
- By dark.
- Yeah.

127
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:13,477
Can you even imagine
having that much money?

128
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,113
[Joe] I sure as hell can.
Can't you?

129
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,881
No, not really.

130
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,717
I bet you actually
can't neither.

131
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:23,220
Fighting words, Evans.

132
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:25,689
Hell, you best give me your
share so as I don't whup ya.

133
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:29,226
I will die of laughing
before you whip me, boy.

134
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,134
Think we'll
find her dead?

135
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,636
[sighs]
I don't know. Probably.

136
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,077
You okay?

137
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:51,381
- Hey? What's the matter?
- Nothing.

138
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,984
Come on, tell me.
What's up?

139
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,722
We're going to California.

140
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:03,126
They told us this morning.

141
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,329
Said we are giving up
on Texas.

142
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,332
Shit, man.

143
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:10,367
How long you going for?

144
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:12,769
Well, forever.

145
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:16,540
I mean, when you think about
it, why would we come back?

146
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,448
Yeah.

147
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:31,221
Guess you'll have to find
someone else to bitch to.

148
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:35,259
Ain't no one I'd rather
bitch to than you, Garza.

149
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:38,997
- Can you handle that?
- Let go, you jackass!

150
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:40,965
[Eugene] No. I gotta
get it in before you go.

151
00:09:41,098 --> 00:09:42,332
Yeah.

152
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,935
[Eugene] Come get me!
Come get me!

153
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:47,170
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

154
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:49,439
- [both laugh]
- [Eugene] Come on! Come on!

155
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:50,707

I think you should

No, no, no.
You're my doctor now, okay?

- Okay.

That's the point.

319
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:12,949
You got that much on you?

320
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,652
I don't have a nickel.

321
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,288
But I know my way around a
bank, even a Mexican one.

322
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:20,857
And I can have you that money
before you even know I'm gone.

323
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,795
All you need to do
is get me a car.

324
00:22:27,364 --> 00:22:29,899
[scoffs] Well, that ain't an
easy thing to get around here.

325
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:31,535
Especially
with an empty wallet.

326
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:34,871
Maybe I'm wrong, but you seem
like a pretty capable fella.

327
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,508
I need a few days
to rest up.

328
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:41,111
And if you apply yourself to our
problem between now and then,

329
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:43,913
well, then, I'd say we're
in business, wouldn't you?

330
00:22:50,054 --> 00:22:52,089
I've seen your fields, Eugene.

331
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:55,825
I know your family's in trouble,
same as mine was.

332
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,362
I mean, if there's a simpler
way to fix things for you,

333
00:22:58,495 --> 00:23:00,897
I don't have the faintest
what that would be.

334
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,302
I could turn you in.

335
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:19,616
Sure. You could.

336
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,658
But, Eugene, and I say this with
all seriousness and sincerity.

337
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,129
If that's the choice you make,
and it is your choice to make,

338
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:35,532
have no illusions
of the consequences.

339
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,335
I won't be another victim
of their lies.

340
00:23:39,436 --> 00:23:41,572
I'd rather die by my own hand.

341
00:23:42,806 --> 00:23:44,441
Or yours.

342
00:23:58,088 --> 00:24:00,624
This is
a land of burden, kid.

343
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:04,528
Right now,
you get to pick yours.

344
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,133
Makes you
one of the lucky ones.

345
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:44,701
- Why are you naked?
- Shh!

346
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:47,337
Okay, but...
what the hell?

347
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:49,973
Don't worry about it, okay?
And don't swear.

348
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:51,575
I ain't worried.
I'm curious.

349
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:52,942
Don't be.

350
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,546
All right, just go back
to sleep. Come on.

351
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:17,067
[wind chimes tinkling]

352
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:22,473
You're heading
into town today.

353
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,074
Look for some work.

354
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,576
Take your sister with you.

355
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:27,578
[groans] Yes, sir, okay.

356
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:30,113
And gear up.

357
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:32,583
They're saying
it's a windy one.

358
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:02,479
[door opens]

359
00:26:03,714 --> 00:26:05,048
Hey.

360
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:09,186
- Hi.
- I thought you might want to change.

361
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:12,389
[sighs]

362
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:18,362
It's perfect.

363
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,600
I hope it fits okay.
It's my mother's.

364
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:27,204
She don't wear it much, so
she shouldn't notice it's gone.

365
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:29,239
[Allison] She'll notice.

366
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:31,909
Maybe she'll come in here
looking for it.

367
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,478
What, in here? No, no.

368
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:37,748
They ain't got much use for
this since the drought started.

369
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:45,155
Okay. Thank you.

370
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,065
Oh, excuse me.

371
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:58,769
[door closes]

372
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:19,289
- What are you looking at?
- Uh, nothing.

373
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:20,657
You're supposed to
take me to town.

374
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,593
- Yeah, well, I'm busy.
- You ain't.

375
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,029
- I am.
- What were you looking at?

376
00:27:25,162 --> 00:27:27,564
Nothing. I was just seeing how
it looked in there, that's all.

377
00:27:27,698 --> 00:27:28,967
I ain't dumb.
What's in there?

378
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:31,535
Ain't nothing
in there. Christ!

379
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:36,573
Okay, I'll tell you
if you promise me

380
00:27:36,707 --> 00:27:38,842
you ain't gonna go in there
and look for yourself.

381
00:27:38,977 --> 00:27:42,212
I don't want Mama or George going
in there until I clean it up.

382
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:43,680
Clean up what?

383
00:27:43,814 --> 00:27:44,748
You promise?

384
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:46,550
Yeah, tell me.

385
00:27:51,188 --> 00:27:56,460
Two dead dogs. Lying there with their
blood and their guts all in the dirt.

386
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:58,428
Flies all around.

387
00:27:59,063 --> 00:28:00,731
Dogs? Whose dogs?

388
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:02,933
Nobody's.

389
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,501
The blue yonder's.

390
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:06,770
What killed 'em?

391
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:09,306
Coyotes or something.
How should I know?

392
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,575
That's sad.

393
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:13,777
That's life.

394
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:16,146
Wait, where you going now?

395
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,748
[Eugene]
Going to meet Joe Garza.

396
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:21,119
- [Phoebe] What about? Can I come?
- [Eugene] Nothing and no.

397
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:24,755
Hey, Eugene
[panting]

398
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:30,761
Why the hell you drag me
out here, Evans?

399
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:39,236
I got some private words
for you, Garza.

400
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:44,142
You know, I thought we was
gonna look for that woman today.

401
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:46,978
So I got up
butt-crack of dawn.

402
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:48,779
And then
you don't even show.

403
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:51,348
Now this.

404
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:55,919
How long have I known you?

405
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:59,489
- Years and years, by my count.
- You stand by me.

406
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:02,225
And in those years,
I've gone and trusted you.

407
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:06,630
Okay? And that's why what I'm
about to ask might seem unfair,

408
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:09,266
but it could save
both our necks.

409
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:13,770
Spit it out.

410
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:19,977
I need your family's truck...

411
00:29:20,111 --> 00:29:21,645
for good.

412
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:24,715
I'll send you the money
as soon as I get to Mexico.

413
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:29,453
You getting stupid
on me, Eugene?

414
00:29:29,586 --> 00:29:31,321
We are leaving in it
next week.

415
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:33,790
What the hell's going on?

416
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:36,693
I can't tell you everything right
now, but I've met somebody.

417
00:29:36,827 --> 00:29:39,296
And they're gonna pay me
20,000 to get them to Mexico.

418
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:41,364
Twenty-thousand!
Do you believe it?

419
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:43,867
No, Evans, I don't.

420
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:47,471
And even if I did, shit,
I'd tell you to eat a toad.

421
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:52,409
If you're saying
what I think you're saying,

422
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,311
then me just saying it
could wind me dead.

423
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,879
No, no, no.
No one's gonna wind up dead.

424
00:29:56,013 --> 00:29:58,548
They're chasing me out
of town enough as it is.

No, not yet.
I'm still trying.

Are you gonna tell me
what's eating you?

444
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,976
I need to get
out of here, Eugene!

445
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:14,078
Yeah, I know that.

446
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:17,248
- Did something happen?
- No.

447
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:19,216
Something could.

448
00:33:20,051 --> 00:33:22,019
It's not safe, me being here.

449

It's not safe for anyone.

450
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:26,623
Yeah, I know.

451
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:29,826
Just...

452
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:32,729
I'm going crazy in here.
[stammers] I'm cooped up.

I'm hurt. I'm dirty.

454
00:33:35,732 --> 00:33:37,801
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, I didn't...

455
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,903
I didn't mean
to yell at you.

456
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:42,706
Sorry.

457
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:51,848
I may have just thought of
something that will cheer you up.

What's that?

459
00:34:06,563 --> 00:34:07,864
You can wash here.

460
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,734
This is a clean
swimming lake.

461

Property's abandoned,
so, we're safe.

462
00:34:18,342 --> 00:34:22,213
We can clean your leg and then
dress it after. How about that?

463
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:27,650
All right then.

Sit down.

Where is Eugene?

I'm missing my blue dress.
Have you seen it anywhere?

Um, no, Mama.

Hello?

Anyone hear me?
I said, "Where is the boy"?

Oh, nothing. I was, uh...

00:36:03,613 --> 00:36:06,217
I was just thinking
about my father.

490

He took me swimming here once
when I was real little.

I'd forgotten about it

And why is that?

513
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:16,920
Well, 'cause what's
the big hoopla about some dummy

before the age of 30, huh?

00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:27,064
This ain't about
when he died.

516
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,002
It's about
how long he'll live.

517
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,775
You see,
the worst part of dying...

is being forgotten.

519

That's why I like Billy.

he died before 30,

He's like a ghost

You see, you can't really die if
people still want you to live.

Not in any meaningful way,

00:48:20,151 --> 00:48:22,253
<i>I would have
recognized that look.</i>

637
00:48:22,385 --> 00:48:24,588
[watch ticking]

638
00:48:27,724 --> 00:48:29,559
Sheriff wants to see you
in his office.

639
00:48:29,693 --> 00:48:31,329
I'm looking
for him too, Janice.

640
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:33,097
- George.
- What's up?

641
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:36,733
Sir, she is still here.

642
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:39,303
I found that on the edge
of the Hartwell property

643
00:48:39,436 --> 00:48:42,372
after he claimed
that he had seen her.

644
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:44,941
And no one's safe
until we find her.

645
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:48,712
Now, the way I see it,
is if we raise the bounty,

646
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:52,382
we could get every farmer
and every farmhand

647
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:55,418
in the county on her ass.

648
00:48:57,654 --> 00:49:00,924
What the fuck do you think
I brought you in here for?

649
00:49:03,361 --> 00:49:07,331
- Huh?
- You send your boy in here at night to steal evidence

650
00:49:07,464 --> 00:49:10,533
and expect me
not to fire your ass?

651
00:49:33,623 --> 00:49:35,558
Where you been, kid?

652
00:49:40,597 --> 00:49:42,766
I know about Perry Montroy.

653
00:49:51,441 --> 00:49:53,077
You lied about him.

654
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:57,447
You could be lying
about everything.

655
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:11,128
I didn't... I didn't tell you about
him because it's hard to talk about.

656
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,465
Was you in love with him?

657
00:50:18,169 --> 00:50:19,903
Are you jealous?

658
00:50:25,508 --> 00:50:26,943
Yeah.

659
00:50:34,918 --> 00:50:36,020
[sighs]

660
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:02,679
I've never seen
anything like it.

661
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:07,751
You're right.

662
00:51:08,486 --> 00:51:10,620
It ain't safe for you here.

663
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:15,525
Or for any of us,
for that matter.

664
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:18,928
You said 20,000, right?

665
00:51:19,063 --> 00:51:21,165
Find me a car,
and I'm history.

666
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:25,202
Same as your family debt.

667
00:51:32,642 --> 00:51:34,911
Oh, shit.
George is back early.

668
00:51:49,659 --> 00:51:51,795
- [grunts]
- Sheriff cut me loose.

669
00:51:51,928 --> 00:51:53,464
- You know why?
- [panting]

670
00:51:53,596 --> 00:51:55,266
The evidence you took,
where is it?

671
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:58,635
- It's gone.
- Gone where?

672
00:51:58,768 --> 00:52:00,337
I forget.

673
00:52:01,938 --> 00:52:04,375
Okay, all that stuff was
lies and made-up nonsense!

674
00:52:04,508 --> 00:52:07,044
Where in God's creation you get the
idea of calling that woman innocent?

675
00:52:07,178 --> 00:52:09,113
- Well, I know things.
- Oh, you "know things"!

676
00:52:09,246 --> 00:52:11,948
The apple don't fall far
from the tree, now, does it?

677
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,218
Full of foolish thoughts,
like your old man.

678
00:52:14,351 --> 00:52:15,585
Well, I may have raised you,

679
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:17,555
but you sure as shit
ain't my son.

680
00:52:17,687 --> 00:52:19,356
Well, thank God for that.

681
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,026
[George] Son of a...

682
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:23,527
- [blows landing]
- [Eugene groaning]

683
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,530
[George]
Where is it, huh? Huh?

684
00:52:26,663 --> 00:52:29,599
You're gonna break your mama's heart
when you end up dead like John Baker.

685
00:52:29,732 --> 00:52:31,835
But he ain't dead.
He's in Mexico.

686
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:33,870
I'm gonna find him
one day.

687
00:52:34,004 --> 00:52:35,439
Sure.

688
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:36,974
Mexico.

689
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:43,047
And this door,
from here on out, stays open.

690
00:52:45,149 --> 00:52:46,183
Shit.

691
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,122
[Phoebe playing piano]

692
00:53:12,742 --> 00:53:15,312
Come on. Shit.

693
00:53:15,446 --> 00:53:16,880
Shit.

694
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:20,884
- Come on.
- [groaning]

695
00:53:28,025 --> 00:53:30,995
[Allison talking indistinctly]

696
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:41,704
Don't stop now.

697
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:47,877
Oh, God. It's fine.
It's fine.

698
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:50,047
I'm seeing stars, Allison.

699
00:53:50,514 --> 00:53:52,316
No. No!

700
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:54,884
No, no, you can make it.

701
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:57,454
Come on. We can make it.
Come on.

702
00:53:57,588 --> 00:53:58,989
Keep running.

703
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:02,892
No. No.

704
00:54:04,295 --> 00:54:06,930
[panting]

705
00:54:10,134 --> 00:54:12,069
I'll see you in Mexico.

706
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:16,839
[sighs]

707
00:54:26,684 --> 00:54:28,751
[wind blowing]

[wind rushing]

709
00:54:55,812 --> 00:54:57,248
Jesus.

710
00:54:58,349 --> 00:54:59,916
Hey, Papa.

711
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,485
Glad you're home.

712
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:05,888
What's wrong now?

713
00:55:06,523 --> 00:55:08,359
[coughing]

714
00:55:08,492 --> 00:55:12,496
[wind howling]

715
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:19,403
No, you ought
to stay inside.

716
00:55:19,536 --> 00:55:22,139
[George] If he's hiding
it, it's in that barn.

717
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:23,741
Don't.

718
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:25,808
That boy needs his mother.

719
00:55:27,278 --> 00:55:30,514
Maybe he'll tell you
what the hell is going on.

720
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:05,416
George, he's sorry
what happened.

721
00:56:06,883 --> 00:56:09,320
But he told me
what you did.

722
00:56:12,523 --> 00:56:13,724
Just trying to help.

723
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:15,693
Help who?

724
00:56:16,193 --> 00:56:18,329
George was dismissed.

725
00:56:19,997 --> 00:56:22,232
Eugene, look at me.

726
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:26,036
We're less than a month away
from being homeless.

727
00:56:30,374 --> 00:56:32,976
George said
John Baker was dead.

728
00:56:35,912 --> 00:56:37,815
And he was right.

729
00:56:38,881 --> 00:56:44,355
Do you remember that postcard
he wrote you when you were six?

730
00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:46,457
Of course, I do.

731
00:56:47,691 --> 00:56:49,460
Yeah, well, he sent more.

732
00:56:50,427 --> 00:56:53,297
But I burned every one of them
after the first.

733
00:56:55,299 --> 00:56:57,234
Every month, he'd write,
and every month,

734
00:56:57,368 --> 00:56:59,536
each card was worse
than the last.

735
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:03,307
They'd be full of talk
about God and people

736
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,710
and strange things he'd seen,
but it was all jumbled up.

737
00:57:06,844 --> 00:57:12,216
He was drinking himself to death,
and his mind was falling apart.

738
00:57:13,784 --> 00:57:17,454
I couldn't let a little boy
read what he wrote.

739
00:57:18,756 --> 00:57:20,524
I only lied
because I love you.

740
00:57:20,657 --> 00:57:24,261
- You're lying to me now, Mama.
- No, Eugene, I'm not.

741
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:27,831
After five years,
the cards stopped.

742
00:57:27,965 --> 00:57:30,534
And I believe that was
'cause he died.

743
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:33,771
No. No, you can't be sure
of that. You can't.

744
00:57:33,903 --> 00:57:35,105
Eugene!

745
00:57:36,073 --> 00:57:37,940
Eugene, I...

746
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:41,879
I'm sorry.

747
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:43,480
Oh, God.

748
00:58:00,631 --> 00:58:02,332
[grunting]

749
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:23,720
He shut that door?

750
00:58:24,822 --> 00:58:26,123
I did.

751
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:41,071
He say anything meaningful
about what he done?

752
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,942
No.

753
00:58:48,545 --> 00:58:52,449
I need your help with this, George.
He ain't going nowhere.

754

Okay, I'm going.
I'm here to say goodbye.

Take me with you.

You don't even know
where we're going.

That don't matter.

Phoebe, we're going
to Mexico.

765

Mexico. I'll learn
Spanish, okay?

766
01:00:09,893 --> 01:00:12,296
No. You gotta stay here.

767

I'm gonna send lots of it.

- Well, that don't matter, does it?

01:00:19,069 --> 01:00:20,304
This is a good thing.

770
01:00:20,437 --> 01:00:22,806
Why you doing this?

[chuckles] You don't neither.

776
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:36,453
I know that if you loved us,
you'd stay.

01:00:36,587 --> 01:00:38,922
- If you loved me.
- Phoebe, I do love you.

Well, then stay.

01:02:34,105 --> 01:02:35,405
[Olivia]
Why are you saying that?

798
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:37,175
[Phoebe] Because I'm
telling the truth.

799
01:02:37,307 --> 01:02:38,875
The damn truck's gone.

800
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:44,347
Papa! Papa, Phoebe here's been saying
strange things about her brother.

801
01:02:44,481 --> 01:02:47,217
I want you to tell her
they isn't true.

802
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:49,786
What things
she been saying?

803
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,623
She says Eugene's been helping
Allison Wells, the fugitive?

804
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,726
But that just isn't possible.

805
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:58,261
It's just
a little girl's fantasy.

806
01:02:58,395 --> 01:03:01,398
- Isn't it?
- [Phoebe] No, it ain't.

807
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:06,503
Phoebe, you best tell us
where he's gone.

808
01:03:09,207 --> 01:03:12,375
You don't want your brother
to get hurt, now, do you?

809
01:03:21,384 --> 01:03:24,454
I'm gonna miss you,
but I hate goodbyes.

810
01:03:24,588 --> 01:03:26,656
You should pull over soon.
We don't draw this one out.

811
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:29,026
No, no, no. There ain't
gonna be any goodbyes.

812
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,561
You don't gotta
fret about it.

813

Oh, no. Kid, no.

814
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,503
I'm going to Mexico alone.

815
01:03:39,971 --> 01:03:40,972
Afraid not.

816
01:03:41,105 --> 01:03:43,473
Afraid so.

817
01:03:43,607 --> 01:03:45,876
What about your family?
You just gonna leave 'em?

818
01:03:47,111 --> 01:03:48,812
You know what, Allison?

819
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:52,482
I've got family
in Mexico too.

820
01:03:53,017 --> 01:03:54,252
Your father.

821
01:03:54,384 --> 01:03:55,552
Right.

822
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,654

823
01:03:58,588 --> 01:04:00,357
High damn time
I track him down.

824
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:03,894
I don't think you understand
what it entails to find somebody,

825
01:04:04,028 --> 01:04:05,529
let alone in Mexico.

826
01:04:05,662 --> 01:04:07,697
What does it matter to you if
I come to Mexico or not, huh?

827
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:12,402
- It matters 'cause you're in love with me, and you expect...
- No. No. No, I ain't.

828
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:19,110
You know what, Allison?

829
01:04:20,178 --> 01:04:23,014
Last night I said to myself,
there is no way in hell

830
01:04:23,147 --> 01:04:25,715
that you're going to Mexico
by yourself.

831
01:04:27,118 --> 01:04:28,919
There ain't.

832
01:04:29,053 --> 01:04:33,590
So, whether you love me back
or not is besides the point.

833
01:04:35,126 --> 01:04:36,827
I don't love you back.

834
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:42,332
Well... it's a long drive.

835

God, what did I do wrong?

836
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:53,010
How did they
come across one another?

837
01:04:53,144 --> 01:04:56,847
I don't know, but if word gets out
that that woman was hiding here,

838
01:04:56,981 --> 01:04:59,549
and I'm not the one
to bring her in...

839
01:04:59,683 --> 01:05:01,418
Makes me sick
to even think about.

840
01:05:01,551 --> 01:05:03,887
You think I care right now
about any of that?

841
01:05:04,021 --> 01:05:05,990
What's gonna happen
to my son, George?

842
01:05:06,123 --> 01:05:08,159
I'm calling Tade,
and I'm calling Lomax.

843
01:05:08,292 --> 01:05:11,062
We're gonna find him
before anyone else does.

Tade? George Evans.

845

Have you still got
that buck shooter?

846
01:05:15,899 --> 01:05:17,601
- Don't shoot my son, George!
- Hey!

847
01:05:17,734 --> 01:05:20,503
Ain't no one getting shot
until he's free and clear.

848
01:05:20,637 --> 01:05:22,139
All right, Tade,

- Just bring my son back to me,

853
01:05:33,483 --> 01:05:36,553
or you don't bother
coming back.

Do you have the gun?

- No, we ain't using...
- Please, tell me you have the gun.

We ain't using it though,
right, Allison?

861

Not if we don't have to,
but we do have to pull over.

What's the problem, sir?

867
01:06:50,194 --> 01:06:54,165
Well, the problem is you ran
a clearly placed stop sign.

868
01:06:55,099 --> 01:06:57,168
You leave your good sense
at home, son?

Oh, uh, no, sir.

870
01:06:59,836 --> 01:07:04,208
I'm sorry. I didn't see the stop sign
till it was too late, that's all.

I don't know him.

You know, there's

and ready to kill.

that I associate with,
so I ain't seen her.

883

If I do, I'll be sure
to let the authorities know.

I wasn't even thinking.
I just... I just did it.

1112
01:25:55,206 --> 01:25:56,873
Because you had to.

1113
01:25:57,007 --> 01:25:59,176
Eugene, it would have
been me otherwise.

1114
01:25:59,843 --> 01:26:01,078
And if someone
had to die today,

1115
01:26:01,212 --> 01:26:03,147
I'm sure glad
that choice was yours.

1116
01:26:03,746 --> 01:26:05,949
A man is dead because of me.

1117
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:08,718
I know.
I know how you feel.

1118
01:26:08,852 --> 01:26:10,854
I know how you feel,
but we need to move.

1119
01:26:10,988 --> 01:26:12,856
You need to get
in the car, Eugene.

1120
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:14,924
Allison, I don't think
you understand.

1121
01:26:15,059 --> 01:26:16,659
I don't think I can do this.

1122
01:26:16,793 --> 01:26:18,229
- I do understand...
- You don't!

1123
01:26:18,362 --> 01:26:20,064
I understand! Maybe
"I understand" doesn't mean

1124
01:26:20,197 --> 01:26:23,067
I'm just gonna sit down
and wait to die myself.

1125
01:26:28,606 --> 01:26:30,241
How would you understand?

1126
01:26:33,277 --> 01:26:34,478
Eugene, please.

1127
01:26:34,612 --> 01:26:35,945
Please, get in
the goddamn car.

1128
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,814
Who did you kill, Allison?

1129
01:26:42,652 --> 01:26:45,389
You're everything
they said you was, ain't ya?

1130
01:26:50,561 --> 01:26:54,231
- I don't know if it was me who killed her.
- How could you not know?

1131
01:26:55,099 --> 01:26:56,766
Because it was happening
all at the same time.

1132
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,202
If you weren't there,

1133
01:26:58,335 --> 01:27:01,405
would that girl
still be alive today?

1134
01:27:09,246 --> 01:27:11,482
You made me into something
that I ain't.

1135
01:27:11,615 --> 01:27:15,452
I didn't make you into anything
you didn't already want to be.

1136
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:24,361
- [Eugene sighs]
- Eugene.

1137
01:27:27,264 --> 01:27:28,731
Please.

1138
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:38,841
Eugene!

1139
01:27:41,979 --> 01:27:43,314
Ain't that your truck?

1140
01:27:45,915 --> 01:27:47,484
[Allison] Eugene!

1141
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:54,824
[George]
Stay here with her.

1142
01:27:57,161 --> 01:28:00,598
Eugene, we can still
get to Mexico.

1143
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:01,999
Don't you want
to find your father?

1144
01:28:02,132 --> 01:28:05,336
He's gone, Allison!
He's dead.

1145
01:28:06,736 --> 01:28:08,938
I ain't gonna find nobody!

1146
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,858
This is goodbye.

1147
01:28:41,804 --> 01:28:43,340
Don't shoot me.

1148
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:57,454
[gunshot]

1149
01:28:58,389 --> 01:29:00,991
[George] Phoebe,
get in the car!

1150
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:02,393
Go.

1151
01:29:04,328 --> 01:29:05,529
[gasps]

1152
01:29:08,132 --> 01:29:11,201
If you want the bounty,
you can take me in and get it.

1153
01:29:11,335 --> 01:29:13,437
[panting]

1154
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:15,439
Or we can stick to the plan.

1155
01:29:15,572 --> 01:29:18,042
I said, get in the car.

1156
01:29:18,642 --> 01:29:19,909
But Eugene's out there.

1157
01:29:20,044 --> 01:29:22,912
I won't let nothing happen
to him. I promise.

1158
01:29:23,047 --> 01:29:25,182
It's all right.
It's all right.

1159
01:29:26,317 --> 01:29:27,384
Stay here.

1160
01:29:33,057 --> 01:29:35,225
Either way,
I'm leaving it up to you.

1161
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:48,505
I'll tell them
I made you do everything.

1162
01:29:50,341 --> 01:29:52,842
You can go on with your life.

1163
01:29:58,848 --> 01:30:01,085
You got to pick
your burden, kid.

1164
01:30:09,093 --> 01:30:10,927
[whispers] Hey.

1165
01:30:12,262 --> 01:30:14,465
I never wanted to lie to you.

1166
01:30:15,632 --> 01:30:18,868
I told you all the truths
I knew how to.

1167
01:30:19,869 --> 01:30:22,206
And I am
who you thought I was.

1168
01:30:25,075 --> 01:30:27,177
It's a little more
complicated is all.

1169
01:30:34,118 --> 01:30:35,885
I'm scared, Allison.

1170
01:30:37,721 --> 01:30:39,223
Yeah, me too.

1171
01:30:40,457 --> 01:30:43,360
I'd rather be scared
with you than alone.

1172
01:30:46,463 --> 01:30:47,498
Please.

1173
01:30:49,066 --> 01:30:51,934
We can baptize ourselves
in the ocean.

1174
01:31:04,815 --> 01:31:06,049
Let's go.

1175
01:31:14,358 --> 01:31:16,160

- [both gasp]

Get out of the way!

1177

We can make it.

1178

[whimpering] Oh, my God. No.

Put your guns down.

Put your guns down!

Put it down!

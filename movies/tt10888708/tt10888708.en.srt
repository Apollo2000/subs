2
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,958
So, there my grandfather was.

3
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,708
Alone, injured,

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,875
scared, in space.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,083
{\an8}And the only way he could survive
until his crew came back to rescue him

6
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,291
{\an8}was by growing vegetables…

7
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,875
{\an8}In his own poop.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,666
OK, Kevin...
I'm gonna stop you right there.

9
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,083
I'm having a hard time
believing this is true.

10
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,833
Mrs. Westenfeldt,
I don't know what would make you think...

11
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:49,041
Well, for one thing,
it's the plot of <i>The Martian.</i>

12
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,875
- Come on.
- Enough already, Kev.

13
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,166
Where do you think they got the idea?

14
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,583
Ow!

15
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:53,833
My God. Oh, my God.

16
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,333
Clancy?

17
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,833
Is your head OK?

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,791
Uh, hey, Travis.

19
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,291
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

20
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,083
So, I'm having this party tonight.

21
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,916
My parents are out of town.
You should come by. Here, um…

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,666
- Give me your number, so I can...
- Oh, um, I don't have that.

23
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,666
- You don't have a number?
- No. I don't have a phone.

24
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,375
My mom won't let me.

25
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,791
She thinks social media's
where serial killers

26
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,625
and college admissions
get their information about you.

27
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,708
That's… That's really weird.

28
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,666
Yeah.

29
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,708
- Hey, Trav.
- Hey, Emma.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,375
Your party is going to be wicked awesome.

31
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,583
Oh, and shouldn't you be
in rehearsal, band nerd?

32
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,083
Don't worry about them.
They're annoying.

33
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,875
Hope I see you tonight.

34
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,625
Louisa, thank you.
Violin sounded excellent.

35
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,458
Alright, guys, practice, practice.

36
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,625
Alright. Bye, kids.

37
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,541
- Great job today, Clancy.
- Thanks.

38
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,791
Did you finish your... your audition tape?

39
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,750
Um, not yet.

40
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,458
Not yet?

41
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,000
Clancy, the application deadline
is in two weeks.

42
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,250
I know, I…
I filmed one last night, but I deleted it,

43
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,958
'cause at ends, I was a little pitchy,
and the high notes were flat. I…

44
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,708
- I just need...
- Hey, listen...

45
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,000
Make the tape this weekend,
get it to me by Monday.

46
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,958
That's it. You got this.

47
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,333
- OK.
- OK. You got this.

48
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,125
Kids class. You wanna practice? Fine.

49
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,541
Ooh!

50
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,083
Ooh, you look good!

51
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,833
Yeah, I didn't...
didn't think I'd see you here.

52
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,875
You look fierce.

53
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,625
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,833
Yeah!

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,875
{\an8}<i>Nice moves, loser.</i>

56
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,791
{\an8}<i>- This is so good, man.</i>
<i>- It was just a joke.</i>

57
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,666
{\an8}- <i>Where you going? Get back here.</i>
<i>- Leave me alone.</i>

58
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,083
Where you going? Come on.
Give me one more move.

59
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,166
I knew you were there the whole time.
It was just a joke.

60
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,750
- You're gonna be famous.
- Hey.

61
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,000
- Everything OK here, boys?
- Yep. All good.

62
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:43,916
Sure.

63
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,416
Alright. Why don't you head back to lunch?

64
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,875
Not so fast, you three.
You're eighth graders.

65
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,666
You think you should be
picking on younger kids?

66
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,333
What are <i>you </i>gonna do about it?

67
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,541
Oh... Jeez, well.

68
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,791
I guess, first I would find out
who your parents are.

69
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,166
Then I'd find out where they live.

70
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,041
And one night,

71
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,833
when you're all sound asleep,
I'd cut a small hole in their brake lines.

72
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,291
So, one minute you've got brakes,
and the next,

73
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,416
you're rolling right through a stop sign

74
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,083
and getting smashed into little,
unrecognizable pieces by oncoming traffic.

75
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,583
Oops! You missed lunch.

76
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,583
Better not be late for class.

77
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,000
Guys, wait up!

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,416
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey!

79
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,708
Hey, guys!

80
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,208
TGIF! How was school?

81
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,291
Fine.

82
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,833
- Did anything interesting happen?
- No.

83
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,083
OK.

84
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,125
Dad, you really brought
those weird finger things to school?

85
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,291
Uh, no, I didn't bring these
with me to school, OK?

86
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,833
I have a spare set in the car.

87
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,208
- That's even weirder.
- Kevin, can you tell your sister

88
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,500
that being a pastry chef

89
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,500
requires enormous finger strength
for kneading dough?

90
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,208
- Look at that muscle.
- Yeah, look at it. He's the finger ninja.

91
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,041
- Hola. What's goin' on, Finch family?
- Hi.

92
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,625
Thanks for always letting me
catch a ride, Mr. Finch.

93
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,208
- You're basically family, Mim.
- Don't be a perv! Close the door.

94
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,541
So, Mim...

95
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:47,916
Oh, boy.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,208
Well, looks like we're all here.
Let's hit it, Dad.

97
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,458
I'd love to, but I can't jump the line.

98
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,916
Yeah, it's just, idling like this
is super bad for the environment.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,291
Oh... Do you have to take a number two?

100
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,583
Dad, what? No!

101
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,250
No, I'm just saying.
I know you don't like going in school,

102
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,250
and I remembered last year,

103
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,500
when you held it in for five days,
and finally...

104
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,625
Dad, stop! You're killing me!

105
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm killing you?
You were killing us, when you...

106
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,666
Hey!

107
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,583
- Mr. Finch…
- Hey, Mrs. W.

108
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,166
You know what I just realized?

109
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,291
Mrs. W and Mrs. Westenfeldt
have the same amount of syllables,

110
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,333
so me calling you "Mrs. W"

111
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,625
doesn't save any time.

112
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,291
- Isn't that funny?
- Ha-ha.

113
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,166
- She doesn't care.
- It's funny to me.

114
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,583
Mr. Finch, Kevin gave a very interesting
oral presentation

115
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,166
in social studies class today.

116
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,125
Really?

117
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,458
It was a project on their family history

118
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,083
and Kevin had fascinating things to say
about your family.

119
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,375
Oh, well...

120
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:47,166
And how they were a troupe of traveling
Russian acrobats turned astronauts

121
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,416
- NASA trained for secret space missions.
- That...

122
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,041
Kevin tends to live
in his own imaginary little world,

123
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,458
- which can be great…
- Yes.

124
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,583
…except when it comes at the expense
of participating in real life.

125
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,625
Except then.

126
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,875
So... I will give him the weekend
to redo his project.

127
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,291
- That seems fair.
- He can present again on Monday.

128
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,083
- Hm.
- Well, I appreciate that.

129
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,625
And she's gone.

130
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,583
Alright. Everybody, buckle up,
the correct way.

131
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,708
- Who puts ketchup on pizza?
- OK, Kevin.

132
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,041
- Hey, hon!
- Hey, guys.

133
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,000
You should've seen me.
I was a tiger in the carpool line.

134
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,708
You are the king of carpool.

135
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,291
Guess what.
I had a chat with Mrs. W.

136
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,458
- Kevin's at it again.
- Kevin, are you telling tales again?

137
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:35,500
- How was lunch duty today?
- You know, same as usual.

138
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,750
Actually, an 8th grader got into trouble
with his phone. I had...

139
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,208
Wow! An 8th grader has a phone,
and I don't.

140
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,583
Mom, can we talk about this?
Please. It's time. I need a phone.

141
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,791
I'm literally the only one in my grade
without one. I'm a total freak.

142
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,500
Just 'cause you don't have a phone,
doesn't make you a freak.

143
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,333
Mmm... It's not like
"sit with the counselor at lunch

144
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,708
'cause you stink like cheese" freak, but...

145
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,333
You know, in high school
we had this foreign exchange student

146
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,750
who smelled like cheese.
We called him Frankie Fromage.

147
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,583
Ew, Dad! Mom!

148
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,375
- He liked it. Frankie Fromage.
- Focus! Phone.

149
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,000
Honey, we've been over this.
What do you need a phone for?

150
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,041
Travis Schultz asked for her number
to invite her to his party.

151
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,583
Do you know what that means?
He's a senior.

152
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:14,666
Senior.

153
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,875
Wait, a senior? Who? What?

154
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,583
- Travis who? What party?
- Hmm?

155
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,791
What? No. What party? No parties.

156
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,625
- Sorry.
- Are his parents be there?

157
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,708
- Oh my God. I don't know, Mom.
- We can call his parents.

158
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,958
We should call his parents.

159
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,291
- We should call everybody.
- Oh my God. Don't do that.

160
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,625
Absolutely not. Do not call anybody.
That's <i>so </i>embarrassing.

161
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,166
Honey, listen...

162
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,250
I know you think I don't get it,
but I was 15 once too.

163
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,625
I know a thing or two about parties.

164
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,541
- Really?
- Yeah.

165
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:46,000
All you ever talk about is how you spent
every waking moment in the library.

166
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,125
Yeah, well, you know,
parties came and went,

167
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,750
but the library was always there for me.

168
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,833
You're about to quote
your dead poet guy.

169
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,791
- "There are no strangers here, just…"
- "Friends you haven't met."

170
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,083
William Butler Yeats.

171
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,208
Feel like if you can quote that by heart,
you <i>didn't </i>go to a lot of parties.

172
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,208
No parents, no parties.

173
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:06,041
- Come on! Nobody else's mom even cares.
- Well, I'm not everyone else's mom.

174
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,250
Obviously! Everybody else's moms
have a life of their own,

175
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,833
not worrying
about what their daughter is doing

176
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,708
and the scary things that might happen.
God, it's pathetic!

177
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,333
- Hey.
- Oh, so, I'm pathetic?

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,083
Yeah. It's sad.

179
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,666
You know what else is sad?
You're grounded.

180
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,083
Yeah, you're grounded!

181
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,708
She hates me.

182
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,625
Oh, come on, honey…

183
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,416
She's ruining my life, Mim.

184
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,208
Yeah, baby. She's cray.

185
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,416
She lose it when you told her
you were going to Boston for the summer?

186
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,625
You didn't ask her, did you?

187
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,666
- Clancy, do you even wanna go?
- Yes, of course! I…

188
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,291
I mean, I'm probably
not gonna get accepted anyway.

189
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,166
The Berklee Summer Workshop
is a really prestigious music program.

190
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,583
They get a ton of applicants every year
and very few get accepted.

191
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:02,625
Clance...

192
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,833
You're the best cellist I've ever seen.

193
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,833
OK.

194
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:13,541
I might be the best cellist
in our tiny, little corner on Cape Cod.

195
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:18,291
Know what I think? You're secretly glad
your mother never lets you go anywhere

196
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,083
or do anything, 'cause then
you don't have to put yourself out there.

197
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,708
Wha... That's so not true.

198
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,500
Mim! She's grounded. Time to go.

199
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,458
Great.

200
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,500
Then prove it.

201
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,125
We are sneaking out
to Travis's party tonight.

202
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,791
- Mi...
- Shh! Yes. Yes.

203
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,791
Put on your skinny jeans
and your red tank.

204
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,458
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

205
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,000
Angus, stop! Angus! Calm down!

206
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,875
Angus, heel!

207
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,916
Sit. Heel! Heel! Heel!

208
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,208
Ah, he got me! Get down! Lay down!

209
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,875
Stay! I'm the alpha!

210
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,416
Ah... animals.

211
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,041
- Hey, Lewis. What's happenin'?
- Hi.

212
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,875
Kevin's is very excited
about tonight's sleepover.

213
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,291
Thanks for inviting him.

214
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,083
- Here's a bag with some of his stuff.
- Great.

215
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,750
Including his special
nighttime underpants,

216
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,250
which have sensors
that sound a small alarm

217
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,125
- when they get wet.
- Ah. That's cute.

218
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,000
Lewis has a bit of a problem with
wetting the bed.

219
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:28,916
Mom!

220
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,041
Oh, don't worry about it, buddy.
It happens to the best of 'em.

221
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,250
It happens to me
from time to time.

222
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,500
Ron! Get your prostate checked.

223
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,250
Oh, no, I was, I was…

224
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,833
Ye... I will. I should.

225
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,833
- I definitely should. I will. Uh, K-Kevin!
- Uh-huh.

226
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:44,750
Lewis is here!

227
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,958
Come down. Quickly. Like the wind, boy.

228
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,875
Come on, buddy.

229
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,583
No.

230
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,875
- Bye, honey! Be careful.
- Let's go!

231
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,458
Those guys are like the three musketeers,
without, you know, the...

232
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,458
I'll collect him in the morning.

233
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,416
- Eight o'clock sharp.
- OK.

234
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,166
He'll be fine.

235
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,750
Ooh...

236
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,166
Right at the video games.

237
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,291
How about you guys
do something a bit more, uh, productive?

238
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,708
We are! We just took over Tilted Town.

239
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,125
I meant something a little more physical.

240
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,416
My guy's running.

241
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,625
OK, Kevin, I think that this is
what Mrs. W was talking about.

242
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,958
You spend way too much time
in these imaginary worlds.

243
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,416
Why don't you go outside into
the real world and run around a bit?

244
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,500
Oh... Here, Mr. Finch.

245
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,958
- What's this?
- A list of my known allergens.

246
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,666
It's laminated for protection.

247
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,416
Mom was concerned
about your cavalier parenting style.

248
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,250
- It means...
- I know what it means.

249
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,250
OK. I'll make it simple. How about this?
Who wants pizza for dinner?

250
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,208
Me!

251
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,666
- I'm not allowed half-processed cheeses.
- Well, Lewis, it'll be our little secret.

252
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,875
- I'm not allowed to have secrets.
- Oh, it's gonna be a long night.

253
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,875
Honey, I mean, almond milk, soy milk...

254
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,541
Can we just get regular milk for once?

255
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,916
You can't just squeeze something
and call it milk.

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,166
That's just nut water.

257
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,750
You like nut wa... What? Wait a minute.

258
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,083
<i> It was a joke.</i>

259
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,750
H-honey, honey, I-I gotta go.

260
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,208
<i>Everything OK here, boys?</i>

261
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,250
Oh, crap!

262
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,166
Hey! No! Angus, no! Angus! Angus!

263
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,125
- Whoa!
- No! Stop! No!

264
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,333
Here you go, bud.
I happen to have a dog treat for ya.

265
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,250
Gotta be prepared for anything
in this line of work, man.

266
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,458
That was impressive.

267
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,875
- What do I owe ya?
- Uh, it's gonna be 18.45.

268
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,625
Forty-five. You got it. I have… Oh...

269
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:40,791
- I only have a twenty. That's a bad tip.
- Oh, don't sweat it.

270
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,208
No, no, no, I don't wanna be that guy.

271
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,500
Take that, but don't go.
Hold on. Take this.

272
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,333
I own the bakery on Wyndhurst.
Stop by, OK?

273
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,375
- Anything you want, on the house.
- OK.

274
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,625
- Cool. Thank you, man.
- Cool, man.

275
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,666
Nice guy.

276
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,750
It's her.

277
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,083
Wow! You guys picked
the perfect night for a campout.

278
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,000
This is gonna be so cool.

279
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,541
- I don't get why we're being punished.
- Kev, you're not being punished.

280
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,666
- It's fun. It's an adventure.
- Uh, Mr. Finch.

281
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,166
I'm not allowed to play in unfamiliar
frontier settings unsupervised.

282
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,750
Good news, it's not a frontier.
You're in our backyard.

283
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,000
There's a fence.
You're gonna be perfectly safe.

284
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,000
Come on, guys. Inside.

285
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,125
There you go. You got it.

286
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,333
Look at this tent.
We haven't used this tent in ages.

287
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,708
Yeah, because it sucks!
There are bugs everywhere.

288
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,375
- That thing's cocooning!
- There are not bugs everywhere! Ju... Oh!

289
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,458
There he goes...
just back to his little spot, see?

290
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,125
Do me a favor.
Sleep with your mouths closed, OK?

291
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,375
Anyway, have a good time, guys!
This is fun! Camping out!

292
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,291
What now?

293
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,166
- We could tell scary stories.
- OK.

294
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,750
That sounds cool.

295
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,333
You go first.

296
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,041
What was that?

297
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,750
Air? Wolf?

298
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,916
Badger?

299
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,333
- Probably not a badger.
- Alien?

300
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,875
With hooks for hands?

301
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,250
- My God!
- Jeez, Mim.

302
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,166
Oh, you guys should see your faces.

303
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,125
What are you little turds doin' out here?

304
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,875
- S-sleeping in the tent.
- Duh. Why?

305
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,458
My dad thinks it's good for us,
or something.

306
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,041
Parents are so weird.

307
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,166
What are you doing?

308
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,041
Sneaking out, obviously. Cute jammies.

309
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,083
Busted!

310
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,666
- Sorry, I was just, uh...
- Oh... I know what you were doing.

311
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,333
You were trying to sneak one of these.

312
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,416
- Yes.
- Yes! I know.

313
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,458
Every time

314
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:45,333
I bake a new tester recipe, there's always
one or two missing in the morning.

315
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,375
I always thought it was Kevin,
but now I know, it's my daughter.

316
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,875
Guilty.

317
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,958
OK...

318
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,166
Brown sugar, banana,
with avocado frosting.

319
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,625
Gettin' crazy, Dad.

320
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,208
A little wild, but tell me what you think.

321
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,250
You were a little hard on Mom tonight.

322
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,958
She was hard on me.

323
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,250
She grounded me for no reason.

324
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,166
Well, she had her reasons.
You can't talk to Mom like that.

325
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,333
You know, you two are more alike
than you know.

326
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,541
OK.

327
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,458
Alright, enough with the lecture.
What do you think?

328
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
- It's actually really good.
- Good! I picked the right profession.

329
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,708
Yeah.

330
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,541
Alright. Well, you finish that one.

331
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,791
- Do not touch any of the other ones.
- OK.

332
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,583
If Kevin asks, you were never here.

333
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,458
- Alright. Don't stay up too late.
- OK.

334
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,416
- Alright. I love you.
- Love you, too.

335
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,833
So... where you sneakin' out to?

336
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,833
You sneakin' out to meet a guy? Dude? Man?

337
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,875
Don't tell him anything.
He's just gonna tell on us.

338
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,000
- He's a total tattletale.
- I am not!

339
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,208
And we sneak out all the time, right?

340
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,708
You do not sneak out.

341
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:11,625
- You're too afraid of the dark.
- No, we love the dark. Right?

342
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,458
Says the boy with the Captain America
night-light in his room.

343
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,333
Hey, it's not a night-light,
it's an area illuminator,

344
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,250
in case I have to pee
or get a drink in the middle of the night.

345
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,500
He makes crap up. He's a liar.

346
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,625
I'm telling Mom
you called me a liar.

347
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,000
I have to use the restroom.

348
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,958
- Don't look at the Gatorade.
- Oh!

349
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,958
You got this. You're a big boy!

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,791
- Dog?
- Neutralized.

351
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,708
Come on, Lewis.

352
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,333
You've had nothing to drink since noon.
Yesterday.

353
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,708
You got this, man!

354
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,166
OK, here we go.

355
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,583
Hey, Clancy?

356
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,458
Like mother, like daughter.

357
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,041
Are you gonna kill me with carbs?

358
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,666
- Should have brought backup.
- He did.

359
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,625
Hey. Is this about the tip?

360
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,208
Hello again, Mathilde.

361
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,791
Mathilde? No, that's Margot.

362
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,583
Oh! OK. I understand.

363
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,666
So, apparently this is...
a huge misunderstanding.

364
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,875
I see you've met my friend Baxter.

365
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,250
Jean-Paul asked us to swing by,
get the old band back together.

366
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,500
- No, thanks.
- Honey, you know these two?

367
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,958
The crown of Durámuran, it's here.

368
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,875
Looks like you'll get
one more shot at it after all.

369
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,416
I really think that you guys
are in the wrong place.

370
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,541
You're talking about crowns.
The Neidmeyers live two houses down.

371
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,583
He's a dentist,
does lot of crown work, so...

372
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm not interested.

373
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,875
Oh, that's a shame. We need both of you.

374
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,041
Both?

375
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,041
Both.

376
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,291
- Are you guys talking about me too?
- No.

377
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,208
Oh, well, you said both, so that's...

378
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,500
- Time's up. Are you in or dead?
- OK!

379
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,666
No! No. That is not the saying.
It's not "in or dead," it's "in or out."

380
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,583
It's "in or out."

381
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,958
I would like to speak for my wife,
and we're gonna respectfully say

382
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,833
w-w-we are out.

383
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,541
I'm in.

384
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,666
W-What? Honey…

385
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,458
- Honey, wh...
- Good night.

386
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,000
Margot!

387
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,541
- Relax! It's just a mild sedative.
- Margot.

388
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,666
Your wife is a dangerous woman, Mr. Finch.

389
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,333
At least, she used to be.

390
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,666
Margot!

391
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,875
Stuff 'em in the car.
Let's get going.

392
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,125
Guys! Guys! Guys!

393
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,625
Guys! Guys! Guys!

394
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,708
Hey, you're gonna wake up my parents!

395
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,375
No, they're gone!
Ninjas just stole your parents.

396
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,375
S-See? I never lie.
I was telling the truth!

397
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,666
Oh, my God.

398
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,458
- Mom?
- Why would they take your parents?

399
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:04,000
No offense, your dad owns a bakery,
your mom's a housewife.

400
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,916
- It's not thrilling.
- I don't think your mom's really your mom.

401
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,708
I think she was, like, the head ninja,
and she was a very dangerous woman,

402
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,166
and they kept calling her... Mathilde.

403
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:14,791
What?

404
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,625
Mom has another name than "Mom"?

405
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,291
No! Mom doesn't have another name, OK?
She's not a ninja.

406
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,708
She won't go in the basement,
she's afraid of crickets.

407
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:24,916
- They're back!
- Oh my God.

408
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,333
- Who's <i>they? </i>What?
- Shh!

409
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,791
Oh my gosh.

410
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,375
Hello?

411
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,958
Anybody here?

412
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,458
Ooh, hey!

413
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,166
Kevin! I'm not here to hurt you, buddy.

414
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,958
I'm-I'm a friend of your mom's.
Remember me? Henry?

415
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,166
Hmm?

416
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,166
OK. That is… a really cool sword.

417
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,041
Yeah. It's a pirate sword.

418
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,000
Uh-huh.

419
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,458
- Don't make me use it!
- Oh, OK. Whoa.

420
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,583
Kevin, you are really brave,

421
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:26,916
but, I mean, we both know
that's not a real sword, right?

422
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,208
- Hee-yah!
- Ow!

423
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,333
He looks way too fat to be a ninja.

424
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,250
You know, I can hear you.

425
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,041
These things keep your ears warm,
but don't keep the sound out.

426
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,000
- Where are our parents?
- OK, listen.

427
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:49,125
Kids, this is gonna sound confusing

428
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,875
and a little scary.

429
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,000
My name is Henry Gibbs
and I'm a U.S. Marshal.

430
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:57,916
I work for the division of WITSEC.
You might know that as Witness Protection.

431
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,916
About 15 years ago,
your mom entered the program.

432
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,583
Wait.

433
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:06,541
You mean to tell me
our mom's in witness protection?

434
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,041
- Like what they do with mob guys?
- I'm not allowed to get involved

435
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:13,291
- with criminal activity.
- Kids, look, a long time ago,

436
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:17,041
your mom got into some bad things
with some very dangerous people:

437
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,541
the Pescatrici Syndicate.

438
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,166
They were going to jail,

439
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,208
and we convinced them to rat out
a very big crime boss.

440
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:25,708
After that,
we had to get them new identities.

441
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,666
It was my job to protect your mom.

442
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:31,875
Our mom had a whole different life?
What's her real name?

443
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,041
Well, I mean, that's classified informa...

444
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:39,958
Mathilde Tremblay.
Born November 7th, 1976, Ontario, Canada.

445
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,875
We're Canadian?

446
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,333
Wait, is that my phone?
How did you get my passcode?

447
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,916
What? The first four digits
of your badge number?

448
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,916
- Yeah, that was tough to crack.
- OK. Don't like her.

449
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,083
Alright, listen.

450
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:56,375
A video of Kevin dancing,
with his mom in it, got on the internet.

451
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,708
It went viral.
It got, like, a million hits.

452
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,166
The bad guys must have seen it
and tracked her down.

453
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,416
A video of me...

454
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,541
Oh, no. Um, that...
No, that didn't happen.

455
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:10,333
- Nice job, Kevin.
- Fiancé: Leo Beauchamp.

456
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:13,583
Born May 11th, 1974.

457
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:16,916
- Whoa, check out this hottie.
- What? She had a fiancé?

458
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,416
- He is pretty cute.
- He's a musician?

459
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,875
- How long ago were they engaged?
- This was so long ago.

460
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,250
It's before you guys were even born.

461
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:29,708
Kids, your mom is a completely
different person than what she was.

462
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:33,625
Tss! Yeah, no kidding.
She was some Canadian named Mathilde!

463
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,208
What bad things did she do?

464
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,708
She stole things. Very expensive things.

465
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:43,958
I knew it! She always takes
the free samples at the grocery store.

466
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:47,416
Not just one.
I'm talking entire handfuls, OK?

467
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,750
They said they were "getting the band
back together." She said she was in.

468
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,666
Uh, no, no. Hey, hey, stop it.

469
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,666
We're jumping to conclusions.

470
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,583
Y-Your mom...

471
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,500
Mom? Whose mom? Is she even our real mom?

472
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,000
Is anything real?

473
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:03,875
- My whole life has been a lie!
- Oh, Kevin…

474
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:05,791
Is that even my real name?

475
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,541
Of course it's your real name.

476
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,416
I hate hockey and Canadian bacon.
It's just ham.

477
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,000
I said some really,
really mean stuff to her today.

478
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:15,541
I called her pathetic.

479
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:18,458
- ...video off the internet?
- Yeah, it was adorable.

480
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,208
No, that didn't happen.

481
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:23,416
Wait. This is Mom's necklace.
She wears this every day.

482
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,583
- She never takes it off.
- Yea, she never does.

483
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:26,750
Whoa, look at this.

484
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,625
Ooh, she left a message!

485
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:31,375
- What?
- Yes, what is this? Uh, Ang...

486
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,208
- Am... Anger...
- Ak... An...

487
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:34,875
Oh, Angus! Angus!

488
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,041
Who's Angus?

489
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,125
Who's Angus?

490
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,500
- Your dog. Oh my God.
- Yes. OK.

491
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:44,125
Hey, Angus.

492
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:45,666
Angus!

493
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,541
What do you need to tell us?

494
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,250
Hello? Anybody home?

495
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:53,250
Ah, it's no use.

496
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:56,291
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know. He's out cold.

497
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,583
Dude, he's drugged.

498
00:27:57,666 --> 00:28:00,666
Take off his collar
so he's more comfortable. Poor baby.

499
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,000
Wait.

500
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,791
One, nine, nine, Fayette Street.

501
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,416
That's not our address.

502
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Wait a second.

503
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,916
Look! The symbols match.
That has to mean something, right?

504
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,041
What would that mean?
Who's at that address?

505
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,875
I don't know. Uh, maybe Mom's trying
to tell us something?

506
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,916
- We should go!
- Children, listen.

507
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,958
- Whatever you're trying to do right now...
- No!

508
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,625
Guys, whatever's at this address
could help us find them.

509
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,500
We can fix this.

510
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,166
- Let's go get Mom and Dad back.
- Uh, no way!

511
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,666
Those are dangerous people.

512
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,625
You need to leave this to the adults

513
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,375
and trained professionals such as myself.

514
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,166
Baby, you're tied to a chair
with Christmas lights.

515
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,958
Hey! You kids can't just leave me here.
Oh... Oh, see?

516
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:51,250
You know what? I may have misjudged you.

517
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,166
If you could just ke...

518
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:59,250
Oh, she is the worst.

519
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,833
- Miriam?
- Yeah, that's me.

520
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,458
It's night.

521
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,291
- Your parents know you're out?
- Yes!

522
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,375
- Of course.
- They joined a gang of ninjas.

523
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,875
- Shh!
- Is this weird?

524
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,375
- Will I get in trouble?
- No, dude. Seriously?

525
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,541
You're making it weird.
You want me to give you the one star?

526
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:23,958
- I'll do it.
- She'll do it.

527
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,541
Lewis, come on, man.

528
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:38,291
This is our chance
to be heroes in the real world.

529
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:41,291
Not some imaginary world
everyone says we live in.

530
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,666
Come on. Let's go save my parents.

531
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,750
OK.

532
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:52,250
- Boys, let's go.
- Get in the car.

533
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:55,916
Buckle up.

534
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,208
- Go.
- OK. Alright.

535
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,583
Witness protection.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

536
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,666
Honey, that's the point
of witness protection.

537
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,333
- You can't tell anyone.
- So, what?

538
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:10,416
You were loosely associated with bad guys
who were involved in criminal activity?

539
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,250
Sure, we'll go with that.

540
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,583
So you're not really from Nebraska?

541
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:17,083
- Yes.
- Yes, you're from Nebraska.

542
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,875
OK, well, at least that's true.

543
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:21,875
No. I mean, yes, I'm not from Nebraska.

544
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:24,000
What about your Cornhuskers T-shirt?

545
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,125
They gave it to me.

546
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:28,208
- I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you.
- Is our marriage a lie?

547
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,625
No. I know this is traumatic.

548
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:32,291
Yeah! We're being held at gunpoint!
We've been kidnapped!

549
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,416
- Shut up before I kill you both.
- Shutting up.

550
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:40,541
Angus?

551
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:44,083
Angus! Hi, buddy.

552
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,125
Oh, you got old.

553
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:49,416
Who's there?

554
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,083
Mathilde.

555
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,583
- Leo.
- Who's that?

556
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,875
- Her fiancé.
- Her <i>what?</i>

557
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,500
Oh, that's great.

558
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,250
That's… that's great.

559
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,291
- What are you doing here?
- I don't...

560
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:19,875
I'm sorry.

561
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,625
For what?

562
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,291
For this!

563
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:30,500
What is happening?

564
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:33,916
This is it, kids.

565
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:37,166
Great. Creepy storage unit place.

566
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,833
- It's cute. It's great.
- This night keeps getting better.

567
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:43,666
I'm not allowed
to break into private property.

568
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,541
- Your choice, Lewis.
- Nobody's allowed to trespass.

569
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:50,375
Thanks, team.
We got this. Thanks, guys.

570
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:52,666
Wait for me.

571
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,916
OK, wait!
I wanna make sure I get this straight.

572
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,041
You got the same exact kind of dog,

573
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,125
and then gave it the same exact name.

574
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:05,458
Know what I wanted to name it?
Indiana Bones.

575
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:08,250
But you insisted on Angus
and now I know why.

576
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,583
I wasn't allowed to bring him
into the program and I missed him.

577
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:15,291
There's a midnight gala tonight
in the Grand Concert Hall.

578
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:18,625
The royal crown of Durámuran.

579
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:21,833
The crown will be on the head
of the Queen of Moldana.

580
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,875
- The King and the Queen...
- Sorry, don't mean to interrupt, ma'am.

581
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,833
Honey, is there a second set of children
who look exactly like ours

582
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,333
that I should know about?

583
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,750
Wait. You have kids?

584
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:35,125
- Course you do.
- Yeah.

585
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,125
Oh, man.

586
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,625
I mean, when we both
went into the program, I just…

587
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,750
I guess I just never found…
the right person.

588
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:49,333
You know what else you didn't find, Leo?

589
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:52,333
Your sleeves.
You couldn't find your sleeves.

590
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:54,583
- It's cold out! What's he trying to prove?
- Ron!

591
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:56,958
You know what?
The answer is no. We won't do it.

592
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,041
Then, we have no use for you.

593
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,250
- Nah.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

594
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,458
If we steal this,

595
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:03,708
that's it.

596
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:05,208
We're done. We're even.

597
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,750
You leave my family alone.

598
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:11,708
We pull this off,
we never have to work again.

599
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:14,500
We'll disappear.
Those kids will be safe and sound.

600
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:16,833
No... it's too dangerous.

601
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,041
God, he's so big!

602
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:21,000
You heard what they said.
If we commit another crime in the program,

603
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,708
we go to jail for a long time.

604
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,666
There's no second chance for us this time.

605
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,541
Well then, we just won't get caught.

606
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,666
Oh, this is unit seven.

607
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,041
But it's locked. Of course.

608
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:38,166
And we don't have the combination.

609
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,333
I mean...
I use my birthday for my locker.

610
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:42,625
Try my birthday.

611
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,416
My birthday is March 20th.

612
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:55,250
My birthday.

613
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,375
Huh!

614
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:03,875
It's dark in there.

615
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,625
This is a bit of a letdown.

616
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:32,416
It's just Nana and Grampy's old crap.

617
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,916
There's nothing cool here.

618
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:38,958
I don't know, babe.
There's just a lot of chairs in here.

619
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:42,583
We won't find anything.

620
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:45,291
There's at least four chairs
in this corner.

621
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:48,833
I'm just really put off
by the amount of chairs in front of us.

622
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,583
<i>DNA recognized.</i>

623
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,375
Kevin, what did you do?

624
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,750
Nothing! That was already there.

625
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:05,958
Uh...

626
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:18,541
Um...

627
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,041
What?

628
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:23,916
- Kevin?
- Kevin?

629
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,833
Kev?

630
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,458
Kevin?

631
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,291
Oh, yeah.

632
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:36,750
I don't think your mom was just
a regular smash-and-grab thief.

633
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:40,333
- Yeah.
- I saw this bad boy on <i>Forza Horizon!</i>

634
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,458
- What?
- Like the rarest car ever!

635
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,916
Can't believe Nana and Grampy
have one of these!

636
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:48,750
Whoa!

637
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,583
Dude there's, like,
a lot of handcuffs in here.

638
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,916
OK, OK.

639
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,875
Your mom is getting cooler by,
like, the second.

640
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,250
Is this hers?

641
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,375
Whoa! Look at this!
Look, it's a lollipop knife!

642
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,208
Whoa!

643
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,625
What do we think?

644
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,458
Hmm?

645
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,458
You need to take off that jacket.

646
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:15,708
Because I'm falling in love with you.

647
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:17,083
What's this do?

648
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,375
- Let's not touch that!
- Um, yeah.

649
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,291
- There's stuff in the pockets.
- What?

650
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:27,083
Oh, my God! Is that my mom?

651
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,875
- Oh!
- She won't even let me dye my hair.

652
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,291
What is...?

653
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:36,166
- Who's William?
- I don't know.

654
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,541
It's missing the last digit
of his phone number.

655
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,791
There's an address.
Maybe we can find him there.

656
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,750
It's all the way in the city, though.

657
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,416
How are we gonna get there?
None of us have a license.

658
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,416
Honestly, even if we did,
Cape traffic on Friday is a nightmare.

659
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,000
- That's, like, three hours.
- But it's only 30 nautical miles.

660
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,333
Junior Marine Biologist Camp.

661
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,625
Thirty miles. We could do that, right?

662
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,333
Oh, but we need a boat.

663
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,958
I know someone who has a boat.

664
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,041
- No.
- Yeah.

665
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:09,250
- No.
- Yes.

666
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,166
- Mim!
- Clancy!

667
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,166
- Are you insane?
- Are <i>you </i>insane?

668
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,125
We're doing this.

669
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:16,166
- Mim, you know I can't do this.
- We have to! You have to do this!

670
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,208
- You're crazy!
- Shut up!

671
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,833
It's to save your parents.

672
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,583
And maybe to get a boyfriend.

673
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,875
I'm not doing this.

674
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:32,750
Boys, you comin'?

675
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,541
Yeah, we're just gettin' some gear.

676
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:36,875
OK, how about this?

677
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:41,125
- It's just a pen.
- Ah, you're right. I'll go put it back.

678
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:47,291
A pen that shoots lasers!

679
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,375
Score!

680
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:51,458
Put that thing down, OK?
Quit touching stuff! Let's go!

681
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,250
We might need this.

682
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:57,125
How you gonna get us to Boston?
You have your permit, not your license.

683
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,958
You've driven dad's van twice,
and almost killed us twice.

684
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:03,041
OK, I did not almost kill us…

685
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,000
The second time.

686
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,791
It's fine! I got this. I'm a great driver.

687
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,750
Also, that wig is awful.
Please take it off.

688
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,958
Oh, you're right.
I don't look good as a redhead.

689
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,291
- Hey!
- Oh, what's this button do?

690
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,833
No...

691
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:22,250
- What?
<i>- Predator mode engaged.</i>

692
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,666
<i>State your destination.</i>

693
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:26,666
- What are you doing?
- Kevin! Oh my God!

694
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,708
Are you guys kid...

695
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,250
Slow down!

696
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,583
I'm not doing anything!
It's, like, driving by itself!

697
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:40,541
I'm not allowed to drive in Predator mode!

698
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,583
I'm too handsome to die!

699
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:51,416
OK... OK.

700
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,291
We're good, we're good. OK.

701
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,375
Oh my God!

702
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,791
- No, Kevin, why are you getting out?
- We're coming!

703
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:59,166
You're not.

704
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,041
- Stay here!
- It's dark outside.

705
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,958
And don't push any more buttons. OK?

706
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,208
- But it's dark!
- We need to go.

707
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,041
Oh my God, there's so many people.

708
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,708
Mim. Whoa, Mim, what are you doing?

709
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:25,583
- We have to figure out what to say...
- We'll say, "Give us your boat."

710
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,125
- You can't just go...
- Act natural.

711
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,375
- No! I'll embarrass myself.
- Have fun! It's fine.

712
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,208
Travis.

713
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:33,708
Hey. You came.

714
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,583
Hey.

715
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,666
Cool party.

716
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,583
Thanks.

717
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:42,958
OK, we need to get to Boston.

718
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,458
- What?
- Well, well, well.

719
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,208
If it isn't Clancy Finch.

720
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,875
Didn't think you had it in you
to show up to a seniors' party.

721
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:52,750
I just thought, once a band nerd,
always a band nerd.

722
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,041
- Hey, Mim, nice outfit.
- Really? Yours is terrible.

723
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,375
- Mm... Thanks.
- Hey! What's up?

724
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:59,333
Hey, little man, what's up?

725
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,958
My God. Did you bring
your little brother to the party?

726
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:03,791
- Call me.
- So weird.

727
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:05,791
How'd you get here?
Your mom drop you off?

728
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,125
No, she got kidnapped by ninjas.

729
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,375
And she drove us here in a super cool car.

730
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:14,166
Wait. Aren't you
the dancing dork from the bathroom?

731
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,041
Yeah, he's so weird.

732
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,291
Alright.

733
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:23,166
OK. Hi. Hello. Yeah, we need to get
across the bay to the city. It's urgent.

734
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,500
You can't just drive
across the bay at night.

735
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:29,458
Yuh-huh. Me and my brothers go across
all the time to go night fishing.

736
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,916
- It's totally cool.
- Yeah, we could take you. Right, Joey?

737
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:35,291
Whatever then. Have fun
with band nerd and the freak fest.

738
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,750
Love you, too.

739
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:39,375
- We're gonna prep the boat now.
- OK.

740
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,250
You go "prep the boat."

741
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:45,375
Uh, do you guys have
proper flotation safety devices?

742
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,208
- Definitely not.
- No.

743
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:52,750
Alright, here's what's gonna happen.
Baxter will run intel. I'm interference.

744
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:56,250
You two, Count and Countess Van Der Holt
of Belgium…

745
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,458
Secure the crown.

746
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:02,541
Escape routes are here on the east side
through the ladies' room vents.

747
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:05,166
Get the Queen there
and the crown's an easy grab.

748
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,666
You got rid of your tattoo?

749
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:11,041
A tattoo? You said that was a birthmark.

750
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,291
You both had the same tattoo?

751
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:18,333
- Um...
- Get ready.

752
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:19,416
Wheels up in ten.

753
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:23,458
- Honey, you said that was a birthmark.
- I didn't know what to tell you.

754
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:24,916
- I'm sorry.
- The...

755
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,750
- You thinking the Vermeer in Dubai?
- Exactly.

756
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,208
Make the Queen sick,
corner her in the bathroom.

757
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:31,583
Dubai?

758
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:33,625
You... you went to Dubai?

759
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:34,583
OK, that's it!

760
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:38,833
I wanna know what the both of you
are involved in, right now!

761
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,333
- Rob…
- Ron.

762
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:41,666
OK.

763
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,625
Look, we were just a couple
of dumb broke kids

764
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:47,875
looking for a bigger life and...
I just wanted it the easy way.

765
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,666
I got us involved
with Jean-Paul Deauxville.

766
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,208
Jean-Paul....

767
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:55,125
- Jean-Paul Deauxville.
- Jean-Paul....

768
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,583
- Deauxville.
- Jean-Paul....

769
00:41:57,708 --> 00:41:59,416
- OK.
- I'm saying what you're saying.

770
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,375
Yeah, close enough.

771
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:04,750
He's a very dangerous, very connected man.
Big-time smuggler and trafficker.

772
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,791
You guys are smugglers?

773
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,041
Of... drugs?

774
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,833
No, honey, don't worry.
Nothing like that.

775
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:14,666
I was a thief of expensive things.

776
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,583
Very expensive things.

777
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:19,375
Priceless artifacts
we'd sell on the black market.

778
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,791
Mathilde… was the best of the best.

779
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:25,125
OK, that's not...
I was not the best.

780
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:29,083
You stole the Sultan of Brunei's
favorite polo pony during the polo match.

781
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,625
OK. Well, yeah, that… that <i>was </i>good.

782
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,291
What a fun walk down memory lane,

783
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:44,250
when you both were
big fat lying smugglers.

784
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,875
- Y-y-you're right, Ross.
- My name is Ron!

785
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,458
The point is,
it was dangerous and illegal.

786
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:51,166
- It was all my fault.
- Ron.

787
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,541
- We were wrong.
- You opened my eyes.

788
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:57,333
She convinced me that we had to get out.
Witness Protection was the only option.

789
00:42:57,416 --> 00:43:01,166
Our testimonies put Jean-Paul
behind bars, where he belongs.

790
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,166
We did the right thing.

791
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,416
Wow.

792
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:10,958
But it cost me everything.

793
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:15,375
I'm coming with you.

794
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,458
- What?
- I'm going with you.

795
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:20,541
- I'm not gonna leave you...
- No! Absolutely not. It's too dangerous.

796
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,458
- No, he could be useful.
- Thank you.

797
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:23,750
- As a diversion.
- Oh!

798
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:26,250
Especially if another situation
like Romania happens.

799
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:28,791
- Romania? When did you go to Romania?
- Honey, no...

800
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,458
Listen. Hear that?

801
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,000
It's a helo. We're taking a helo.
You don't have Dramamine.

802
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:36,208
- What about your motion sickness?
- I don't get motion sickness. This is...

803
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:37,708
Yes, you do.

804
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:40,916
Remember, in the cabin,
throwing up for four days on the cruise?

805
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,916
For the last time, that was
the King Neptune's potato salad.

806
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,916
You don't make
a mayonnaise-based side dish,

807
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,750
leave it out for six hours
and expect no repercussions.

808
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,333
Guys, I'm really at home
on the open water! Loving this.

809
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,708
- Is he OK?
- He gets seasick like his dad.

810
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,166
<i>U.S. Coast Guard.</i>

811
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,666
<i>Cut your engine and prepare
for immediate boarding of your vessel.</i>

812
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,583
<i>Repeat, U.S. Coast Guard. Cut your...</i>

813
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,375
Uh, Travis, what's happening?

814
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:17,708
I don't exactly have my license, so, uh…
we might get arrested now.

815
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,166
- What?
- What do you mean we might get arrested?

816
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,458
We can't get arrested!
We have to find my mom!

817
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:24,708
We can stall them,
say we were messing around, got lost.

818
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:25,625
You guys can swim.

819
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:27,250
- I mean…
- No way!

820
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,958
I-I we don't have a choice, guys!

821
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,750
It's dark so they won't see you,
but you gotta hurry.

822
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:32,666
OK.

823
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,166
Are there things in there
that can, like, eat us?

824
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,958
- No.
- Come on, you guys gotta go.

825
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,416
Clancy, what are you doing?

826
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,875
- We have to do this, guys.
- No! Don't!

827
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:43,375
Wow.

828
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,041
Guys, come on.

829
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:47,416
- Hurry! Jump!
- I don't think I can, Kev.

830
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,708
We can do this, together.

831
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,666
- Hurry! Jump!
- It'll be fine.

832
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,708
- <i>This is the U.S. Coast Guard.</i>
- Come on, guys. Hurry up!

833
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:57,166
You got this, Mim.

834
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,291
One. Two…

835
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:02,958
Three!

836
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,375
I never understood that.

837
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:17,291
They come, sing carols, demand cookies,
they don't leave until they get 'em.

838
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:20,250
Where's the Christmas spirit in that?
It's just plain extortion.

839
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:22,458
Do you know what I mean?

840
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:26,583
OK, calm down.
We are gonna be friends.

841
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,291
Right? We're fr...

842
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:29,416
Oh, look.

843
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,333
Ha! Cupcakes, huh?

844
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:34,041
You want cupcakes?
Let's get some cupcakes.

845
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,916
Get that...

846
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,208
No!

847
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,916
There will be a receiving line

848
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,958
for the King and Queen
in the grand ballroom.

849
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,000
Leo, you install the poison strip
on Mathilde's right palm.

850
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:49,708
Mathilde, once you shake the Queen's hand
and transfer the poison to her,

851
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,041
the oils will absorb into her skin.

852
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,458
You'll have approximately three minutes
before she gets sick.

853
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:58,833
She won't die,
but she'll feel pretty awful for a while.

854
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:03,166
Make sure nothing and no one
besides the Queen touches that right hand.

855
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,500
Honey, are you sure you're alright?

856
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:08,000
That helicopter ride
really did a number on you.

857
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,291
Oh, no, I'm fine.

858
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,708
- Are you sure you're OK?
- No, I'm-I'm totally fine. I'm...

859
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:17,000
Are you gonna...

860
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,708
Yeah, I swallowed it.

861
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,791
I just need bread to settle my stomach.
They're gonna have food at this thing?

862
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:30,041
Uh, we're not really going to have time
to eat tonight, Roy.

863
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:31,083
Yeah, Ron!

864
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,541
It's Ron, Leo.

865
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,625
And I'm not talking about
a sit-down dinner, Leo, OK?

866
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:38,458
I'm talking about appetizers,
or like, a little dip.

867
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:40,833
You know,
I just think it's real interesting

868
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:42,083
that you happen to find

869
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,708
a sleek-fitting tuxedo
in that bag of yours,

870
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:47,041
but here I am, looking like…

871
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,875
like a hobo's butler.

872
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:50,916
Oh, and it's hot like a Berber carpet.

873
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,333
You know what?

874
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:54,500
Next time the three of us
plan a heist together,

875
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:57,000
I'll make sure
we pack more options for you, Raj.

876
00:46:57,083 --> 00:46:59,375
At this point,
I know you know that it's Ron.

877
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:27,500
Baxter has eyes on you. Don't get cute.

878
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,291
Excuse me.

879
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:48,458
Why are we doing this?

880
00:47:48,541 --> 00:47:51,000
- That wasn't so bad.
- That was bad.

881
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:53,416
That was really bad.

882
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,000
Hey! You're a really good swimmer, Kev.

883
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,083
Thanks. I played Jaws in <i>Jaws.</i>

884
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:02,916
Kevin, shut up. No, you didn't.
You're so weird.

885
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,250
OK, seriously, he just, like,

886
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,375
swam that whole way
with me on his back.

887
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:10,000
So, maybe, let's not be mean right now.

888
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:14,083
My entire life flashed
before my eyes back there.

889
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,958
- Kev?
- Yeah?

890
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:21,416
It was really short... and <i>really </i>boring.

891
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:23,541
Lewis...

892
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:24,583
What is it?

893
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,666
I just felt <i>boob </i>on my <i>back.</i>

894
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,083
I think that's first base.

895
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:31,916
Totally worth it, dude.

896
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:44,166
- Is your underwear beeping?
- No. Is yours?

897
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:46,583
No.

898
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:53,541
It was from bay water.
They've clearly malfunctioned.

899
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:54,916
Oh my God, bay water! Ew!

900
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,166
Why are we sitting here talking?
My God! Ew!

901
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,750
No, no, I can't. I literally cannot.
We have to change right now.

902
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:04,333
- There's a gift shop. Let's go in there.
- Ooh, OK!

903
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:07,666
Hey, dude, we should check that out.

904
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:34,375
Wait, you... OK.

905
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:39,916
Passports.

906
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,041
Uh...

907
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,333
Ah...

908
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:52,166
Welcome, Count and Countess Van Der Holt.

909
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:53,625
And…

910
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:56,500
This is our personal secretary,

911
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:58,750
- Suzanne.
- Su...

912
00:49:58,833 --> 00:49:59,791
Suzanne.

913
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:08,375
Hello! Haw, haw, haw.

914
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:12,666
Yeah, Suzanne is my family name,

915
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,500
but, eh, my friends, they call me…

916
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:16,666
Frankie Fromage,

917
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:20,333
because cheese is so strong,
and I am strong, like cheese.

918
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:23,666
I am a little bit more
than a "secretary," yes?

919
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,666
<i>Oui. Sí. Sí. Oui.</i>

920
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:30,041
Yes, I am their bodyguard
because I can punch, and my hands

921
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:33,250
are lethal weapons, you know,
so watch out for me.

922
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,708
I will...

923
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,041
- Oh!
- Whoa!

924
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:38,541
Step back.

925
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:41,208
He will pay for this.
He is a count. He is very wealthy.

926
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:44,000
So put it on his tab.
Where are you taking me?

927
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,500
It's just a precaution.
He's not on the list.

928
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:49,333
Once my men are done searching him,
he'll join you both inside.

929
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,625
Be as thorough as you need.

930
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:57,041
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

931
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:02,958
What are you wearing?

932
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:04,500
We brought you guys cloaks.

933
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,291
We are not wearing those.

934
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:11,291
- OK, it's cold. I'll make it work.
- Whoa, whoa, hey!

935
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:15,625
Where'd you kids get those costumes, huh?
You stay right there! I'm comin' down!

936
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:18,833
Shoot! Come on! And take off the wigs.
You look ridiculous.

937
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,416
But the hats make us look older?

938
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:22,750
Totally.

939
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,833
What? It's just a dry cleaner's.
Where's Carp and Clam?

940
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:58,083
Oh, excuse me. Do you know
where Carp and Clam is?

941
00:51:58,166 --> 00:51:59,083
- The bar?
- Yeah.

942
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:04,333
Uh, this used to be it. They had a fire.
Closed down maybe six years ago.

943
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:05,958
OK. Thank you.

944
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,333
- What are we supposed to do now?
- I don't know.

945
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:21,750
Guys, look.
What's that thing Mom's always saying?

946
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:24,458
"Stop wiping boogers everywhere?"

947
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,041
Ew, no. The other thing.
About the library?

948
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:28,666
Oh! She's always talking about

949
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,916
how she always went to the library,
'cause she had no friends.

950
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,041
She's just trying
to trick me into reading.

951
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:35,375
I'm not falling for it.

952
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:38,250
William is the dead poet guy
she's always quoting.

953
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:41,250
Guys, this is Mom's library,
and this number,

954
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:43,375
it's not a phone number,
it's a Dewey decimal system.

955
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:46,000
It's a call number for a library book.
Come on!

956
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:54,208
It's locked.

957
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,583
How are we gonna get in?

958
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,666
That's convenient.

959
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,375
OK, um, think...

960
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:15,291
OK.

961
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:19,416
W.

962
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,750
I don't know who Dewey is,
but his system sucks.

963
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,500
Got it. Top floor. OK.

964
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,416
Phew...

965
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:52,833
Maybe there's some kind of message
written inside the books.

966
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:55,291
Oh my God.
So we have to read all of these?

967
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,416
No. No way.

968
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:00,791
This is where the book's supposed to be.

969
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:01,875
It's gone!

970
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:05,750
Maybe that Henry guy was right.
Maybe this is a job for the police.

971
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,166
Wait.

972
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,833
That's William Butler Yeats.
That's her favorite.

973
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:16,750
I mean, that can't be a coincidence.

974
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:20,958
Maybe we're not supposed to find a book,
maybe we're supposed to find… this?

975
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:27,916
"Although you hide in the ebb and flow
of the pale tide when the moon has set,

976
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,375
the people of coming days
will know about the casting of my net."

977
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:37,208
Dude, your mom is into
some <i>Da Vinci Code </i>stuff.

978
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,375
What are we looking for?

979
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:43,416
Wait.

980
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,791
- What's that?
- It's Mom's. I brought it.

981
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:58,083
No. Nope. No, no. No.

982
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:02,041
Not doin' it.
Not doin' the stairs of doom tonight. No.

983
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:04,500
Whatever's down there
is gonna lead to my parents.

984
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:05,750
Will it? Will it?

985
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:08,541
Or is this the part
where the four spunky kids

986
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:12,125
go headfirst into the scary,
dark unknown.

987
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,833
And she's getting the stool.

988
00:55:13,916 --> 00:55:15,833
Oh my God. Don't do this.

989
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:18,875
I don't think we should do this.
I think this is a bad idea.

990
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,583
Now the children are getting in.

991
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,416
I don't want this!
I don't want this adventure!

992
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:30,500
No, no, no.

993
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:31,958
Oh my God, no.

994
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:34,166
Where's my night-light when I need it?

995
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,875
Give me it!

996
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:38,333
Don't worry, we... we got this!

997
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,750
Ugh, gross.

998
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:48,750
Ah! What is that? Satan?
No! I hate that. I hate that.

999
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:51,666
I hate this. I hate this tunnel.
What is this? Where are we?

1000
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,500
We should not be down here right now.

1001
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:55,791
I mean, OK, look, I know,

1002
00:55:55,875 --> 00:56:00,333
this night's been insane, and we might not
make it out of this tunnel alive...

1003
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:04,000
- Dude!
- But, I mean, you... you're Mim.

1004
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,583
- Yes?
- You're not afraid of anything.

1005
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:09,875
I mean, you're the bravest person I know.

1006
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,166
I can't do half of the stuff that you do.

1007
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,125
Clancy, look where we are right now.

1008
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:23,000
We are walking through this dark,
disgusting tunnel at your request,

1009
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,416
in the worst all-nighter ever,

1010
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,291
and we're doing it
wearing the worst outfits on the planet.

1011
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:31,750
What is this? I hate these shorts.
They come to such an unnatural length.

1012
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,416
They stop mid-thigh.

1013
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,291
You want brave? <i>Mid-thigh</i> is brave.

1014
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:44,125
Give me a hug. What are you doing?

1015
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:46,458
Aw, bring it in.

1016
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:53,125
Just bring it out.
Just you two. Do your thang.

1017
00:56:58,375 --> 00:56:59,291
Spiderweb!

1018
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh, man. That was a gookie one.

1019
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,708
Hate to see the monster
that made that thing.

1020
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:07,458
Also, what is that?

1021
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,958
How was your cavity search?

1022
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:25,666
- Fun.
- Need to find a way to reach Henry.

1023
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,500
No, it's too risky.
We just do what they want.

1024
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,750
They'll disappear.
Your family will be safe.

1025
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:34,041
Wait a second, who's Henry?
Henry, your best friend from college?

1026
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:36,541
Let me guess.
You didn't go to college together?

1027
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:39,083
Honey, he's the U.S. Marshal
assigned to my case.

1028
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,875
He came over for Thanksgiving
when Kevin was a baby.

1029
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,250
I baked him cranberry cornbread,
and he said he loved it.

1030
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:49,000
It was a prescheduled home visit.
He did love the cornbread. We all did.

1031
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,083
Well, why wouldn't he love the cornbread?

1032
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:54,541
Your Excellencies,

1033
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:57,041
my wife, the Countess Van Der Holt.

1034
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,333
Very beautiful.

1035
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:02,791
Yes, I'm a very lucky man.

1036
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:05,500
I have never forgotten that.

1037
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:12,750
OK, that's it. That's it. That's it!
Alright, we're going home.

1038
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:14,750
Oh! Oh!

1039
00:58:14,833 --> 00:58:16,833
Ah! I... Shh...

1040
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:23,166
It touched my mouth.
What happens if it goes in my mouth?

1041
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,916
Remember when Kevin drank a glow stick
and poison control said to give him milk.

1042
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,791
Can I get milk?
I need some milk! Can I get some milk?

1043
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:32,541
Please excuse our assistant,
he has not been feeling well.

1044
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,250
Food poisoning. Terrible.

1045
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:38,500
Poisoning of the brain.

1046
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,416
You know, you know what?

1047
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:49,583
I think I'm OK.

1048
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,416
I'm alright, I'm OK.

1049
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,375
You know what? I think… I overreacted.

1050
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:59,416
I've a strong immune system. I'm...
I overreact a bit. Nice to meet...

1051
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:05,541
Oh God... I think I'm OK.

1052
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,416
Move back!

1053
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,666
No... I... Wait...

1054
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,750
Oh!

1055
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:20,291
It just looks like
somebody's gross house.

1056
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:23,541
What kind of freak
would actually live down here?

1057
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:26,833
What kind of freaks
would go snooping around

1058
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,291
when they didn't live here?

1059
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:29,708
Good point.

1060
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:34,750
- No! Kevin, no!
- Start talking.

1061
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,083
How did you find this place?

1062
00:59:36,166 --> 00:59:38,041
Our mom had a key!
Her name's Margot Finch!

1063
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:40,083
Don't know her. Wrong answer.

1064
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:41,875
No. Mathilde Tremblay!

1065
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,666
He means Mathilde Tremblay.

1066
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,083
I think she sent us here.

1067
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:48,458
- How do you know Mathilde?
- She's our mom!

1068
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:50,750
I think she's our mom.
Please don't hurt me.

1069
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:55,166
Oh, yeah. You have her eyes.

1070
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,458
So, you know her?

1071
00:59:57,791 --> 00:59:59,458
Yeah. We were like sisters.

1072
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:02,583
Wow. Mom is not like I thought she was.

1073
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,541
Oh. Right.

1074
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,250
I just got off a job.

1075
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,375
Oh, where do you wo...

1076
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:13,500
Oh, you... you stole that stuff.

1077
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:17,250
Not like a big deal or anything.
We steal stuff all the time, right?

1078
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:20,375
One time, I took two puddings at lunch.
I'm a real bad boy.

1079
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,583
Kevin. Could you maybe just…

1080
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:25,833
Tell us everything you know about my mom?

1081
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:29,375
We grew up together. Pulling jobs.
Just kids' stuff, you know.

1082
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:34,083
Scamming tourists, pickpocketing,
petty theft, your basic B and E.

1083
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:38,208
Your idea of "kid stuff" is, like,
a lot different than ours.

1084
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:42,500
Then we got mixed up in some bad stuff
with this guy named Jean-Paul.

1085
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:45,208
J-Jean-Paul!
That's the guy Henry was talking about.

1086
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:48,791
He's in prison now, but his people,
they came after my mom

1087
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:52,375
and now they're planning this huge job,
and we're trying to find her.

1088
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:54,625
Hm.

1089
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:58,583
What makes you think she wants
to be found?

1090
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:01,083
That necklace you're wearing.

1091
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:03,416
She left us the same one
to get down here.

1092
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,750
She left us tons of clues,
they all led here.

1093
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:08,541
I think she wanted us to find you
so you could help us.

1094
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,833
Your mom gave me something

1095
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:17,958
before she went into witness protection.

1096
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:21,875
She said I would know
if it ever came time to open it.

1097
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:36,708
- What is that?
- It's a pager.

1098
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,750
My God, the olden days were tragic.

1099
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,166
It's not a pager.

1100
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,916
It's an old tracking device.

1101
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,916
OK, I'm much better now.

1102
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:52,041
Ahh... OK.

1103
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,250
Yeah. That's all.

1104
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:56,125
No more is comin'...

1105
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,458
Yeah, I think I'm done.

1106
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:03,416
Oof! Stay away from the seafood dip.

1107
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:06,416
If I'm giving advice,
stay away from the seafood dip

1108
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,208
because it's mayonnaise-based.

1109
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,750
So, it's just not a good call.

1110
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:12,958
So, just stay awa...

1111
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:18,833
Ah!

1112
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:25,875
Mm, OK. I thought
it was coming out of both ends.

1113
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:29,125
But it didn't… It didn't.

1114
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,916
We're good. Everybody, we're good.

1115
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:33,208
What happened to your accent?

1116
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,458
What happened to my...

1117
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:39,125
How dare you, sir?

1118
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:42,083
What? Who? Sir!

1119
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:43,750
How dare you...

1120
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,083
say something like that to me

1121
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:48,708
- in front of the royal family?
- Save it.

1122
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:51,166
- Do what?
- We put in a call to your consulate.

1123
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,083
These... are fake.

1124
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:56,750
There is no Count
or Countess Van Der Holt.

1125
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:59,208
Well, what time did you call?

1126
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:01,416
- Maybe it was lunch and they...
- Keep on them.

1127
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,666
- I'm gonna go and get this sorted out.
- Yeah.

1128
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,958
No, I'm saying, to get a croissant or…

1129
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:10,875
Both ends.

1130
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:16,125
Alright, she must have had
a personal tracking device

1131
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:18,750
implanted on her
in case something ever happened.

1132
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,250
The Grand Concert Hall downtown.

1133
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:27,000
Duran Duran! They said something about
the Crown of Duran Duran!

1134
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,291
Durámuran? The Crown of Durámuran?

1135
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:33,166
Oh, Lord... It's the Holy Grail.

1136
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,208
They've been tracking that for years.

1137
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:38,208
Your mom and I tried to steal it
from the Louvre.

1138
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,916
That's a good bedtime story.

1139
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,125
There's an event tonight
at the Grand Concert Hall. A big gala.

1140
01:03:43,208 --> 01:03:46,166
You know what? If the crown
is at that gala, so is your mom.

1141
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:49,250
OK, great! Let's go!

1142
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:53,375
Um... no. I'll handle it. OK?
You guys stay here. It's not a kids' job.

1143
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:56,708
No. We have to go.
We're not gonna get hurt, I promise.

1144
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,208
Aw, that's so sweet.
I don't care if you get hurt.

1145
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,083
You'll slow me down, blow my cover.

1146
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:04,708
Uh, we're not slowing anybody down.
We can blend in, right?

1147
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:06,958
Is that so, General?

1148
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:10,250
Actually, this insignia
is for the rank of commander.

1149
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:14,375
<i>But</i> historically correct facts
are not important right now.

1150
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:15,833
Non-negotiable, OK?

1151
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,750
Your mom sent you here so I would keep
you safe, not send you off to get killed.

1152
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:23,291
Make yourselves comfortable.
There are video games, peanut butter…

1153
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:25,166
- I'm allergic to peanuts.
- Same.

1154
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:28,791
You're not coming.

1155
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:30,708
OK, fine.

1156
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:35,083
But, uh, just out of curiosity,
what is your plan?

1157
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:37,333
I'll go into an air vent
that'll lead me to the subway

1158
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:39,625
and take me directly
to the Grand Concert Hall downtown.

1159
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:40,666
Anything else?

1160
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,500
Yeah, which vent was that?

1161
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,916
The one right over...

1162
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:51,958
Please don't find me and kill me.
I just need to get my mom back.

1163
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:54,375
Not bad.

1164
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:57,458
Although I definitely will find you
and kill you.

1165
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:03,375
- You'll kill her, but we're cool, right?
- Thanks, lady.

1166
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:12,791
Oh! Come on!

1167
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,708
- I'm not allowed on public transport...
- We know!

1168
01:05:26,541 --> 01:05:27,375
Where now?

1169
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:29,708
- Um... This way! Come on.
- OK!

1170
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:38,583
We're never getting past that security.

1171
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:42,500
I don't know about you guys,
but we might be able to get in.

1172
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:45,291
Have you seen yourself?

1173
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:49,375
Oh, you're right. It's the cravat.

1174
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,250
Hey, what about up there?

1175
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:10,208
Window's open.

1176
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:14,208
You'll never fit.

1177
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:16,875
I'll do it.

1178
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:21,291
Oh, doesn't your mom have a rule
about breaking into buildings at night?

1179
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:24,666
My mom is not here.

1180
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:27,750
- He took off the cape.
- OK.

1181
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:29,916
- Hold my hat.
- Snap!

1182
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,208
Come on, Lewis.

1183
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,458
Make it happen, Lewis.

1184
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:47,666
- You can give me a hand with <i>this </i>part.
- Right.

1185
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,666
- We were watching.
- I had the hat.

1186
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,833
- Sorry. There you go. OK
-There it is.

1187
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:55,000
You got this!

1188
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:57,291
Squeeze! Squeeze!

1189
01:06:58,291 --> 01:06:59,583
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

1190
01:06:59,666 --> 01:07:00,625
Look at that.

1191
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,625
He's really doin' it-

1192
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:04,750
Uh-oh. It's OK. Walk it off.

1193
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:06,625
You're good.

1194
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:08,583
- Does he know where to go?
- I hope so.

1195
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:09,500
OK.

1196
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,041
Huh.

1197
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:35,250
Hey! What are you guys doing back here?

1198
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:38,000
Uh, we... We were just, um…

1199
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:41,750
Oh my gosh, we've been wandering
around this place forever.

1200
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:45,166
So, uh, which way to the stage?
Yeah, we just need to set up.

1201
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:49,250
Just got in from Denver. What a cluster
that airport is. Am I right?

1202
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,458
Never been there.

1203
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:53,041
We're the kid musical ensemble
booked for tonight.

1204
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:54,750
Paul Revere's Midnight Ride?

1205
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,875
Never heard of us?
We're pretty big on YouTube.

1206
01:07:57,958 --> 01:07:59,500
Mim, show him the video.

1207
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,250
The viral one.

1208
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:03,708
Uh...

1209
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,541
Two-point-three million hits and climbing.

1210
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,333
Uh...

1211
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,791
Come on.
You think we dress like this for kicks?

1212
01:08:16,666 --> 01:08:18,041
Alright, alright, come on.

1213
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:18,958
Come on.

1214
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:28,583
Good evening. Tut-tut.
We are Paul Revere's Midnight Ride.

1215
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,916
We have an amazing performance planned

1216
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,208
for everyone here.

1217
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:34,000
So, to kick the night off,

1218
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:36,416
we have Cool Clancy on the cello.

1219
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,833
Let's strike up the band!

1220
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,250
Sit down.

1221
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:45,208
Kevin...

1222
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:50,500
No.
I can't... I'm not like you.

1223
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:14,875
I knew it. I knew it!

1224
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:16,708
Uh... Security?

1225
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,541
We got a mess down here on the stage.
Kids in pilgrim shoes.

1226
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:22,000
Clancy, we need you to go. Now.

1227
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:24,083
I can't play in front of all these people.

1228
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:27,208
Of course, you can. You got this! Quickly!

1229
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:29,041
- I'm not ready.
- Yes, you are.

1230
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:32,208
- You're so talented.
- I need backup ASAP, please.

1231
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:34,708
We got kids in puffy shirts.
I need backup!

1232
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:37,000
- Backup ASAP, please! Thank you.
- Wait, wait.

1233
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:53,458
Alright, we've got new orders
to take 'em to the embassy.

1234
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:57,041
FBI is involved.
Apparently, there's some security risk.

1235
01:09:58,041 --> 01:09:58,916
Take care of it.

1236
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:01,416
Yes, sir.

1237
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:07,041
Oh, you two have a secret code now,
a secret language.

1238
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:10,000
Is that what's going on?
That's... perfect.

1239
01:10:10,083 --> 01:10:12,333
What does that mean, Leo?

1240
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,666
- Duck!
- What?

1241
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,083
Whoa!

1242
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,291
What's happening?

1243
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:59,750
Uh, cancel that. They're legit.

1244
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:05,875
Let's go.

1245
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:08,250
Woo-hoo! Oh!

1246
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:10,791
Where'd you learn that?
Did you just kill that guy?

1247
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,541
No, I just crushed his windpipe a little.

1248
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:14,416
He'll be fine
with immediate medical attention.

1249
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,250
"Crushed his wind pi..."
Have you ever killed anyone?

1250
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:20,625
No! Our paramilitary training taught us
how to neutralize a target

1251
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:22,958
in under four seconds
using mostly non-fatal tactics.

1252
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:25,500
"Paramilitary training"? "Non-fatal"?

1253
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:28,833
You made me open up a jar of mustard
for you last week.

1254
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,458
You faked it!

1255
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:33,166
- I faked it.
- Oh my God. Is our whole life a lie?

1256
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,250
What do we... What do we... What...

1257
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,250
Oh!

1258
01:11:40,541 --> 01:11:41,958
Who did I marry?

1259
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,625
Shh!

1260
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:45,958
Is that Clancy?

1261
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,083
Sounds like Clancy.

1262
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:57,250
Clancy.

1263
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,500
Ah!

1264
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,333
- Um...
- Mom?

1265
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:10,583
Kids, stay there.
I'm coming for you.

1266
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,250
Whoa!

1267
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:35,125
Oh!

1268
01:12:38,541 --> 01:12:39,416
Mom!

1269
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,500
Is this what Mom does when we're asleep?

1270
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:02,583
Oh... knock it off!

1271
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,541
- Dad does not look good.
- Nuh-uh.

1272
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:08,375
Oh my God, she looks amazing!

1273
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,166
There's a guy there.

1274
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:20,625
Oh!

1275
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:22,708
Make way! Move!

1276
01:13:22,791 --> 01:13:24,708
Let's go! Make way. Move aside, folks!

1277
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:26,375
Oh!

1278
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:29,041
Crown. Get the...

1279
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,375
Back up!

1280
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:39,875
Come on, jump!

1281
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:47,041
- Clancy.
- Hi.

1282
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:48,291
We gotta get outta here.

1283
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:50,666
- Come on!
- How did you guys get here?

1284
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:55,333
Is that gonna be my car?
Can I learn to drive?

1285
01:13:55,416 --> 01:13:57,583
So great.
Then we found a secret hideout.

1286
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,458
Then, Jay tracked you with your GPS chip.

1287
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:03,291
Kids, I'm sorry
I got you involved in all this.

1288
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:05,291
No, Mom. I'm sorry for what I said.

1289
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:08,666
You're not pathetic, you're amazing,
and I know you might miss your old life,

1290
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,791
but we had to find you
and try and get you back.

1291
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:12,208
Just please don't go.

1292
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:14,500
Honey, I would never leave you!

1293
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:17,833
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1294
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:21,041
Hey, old friend.

1295
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:24,541
Looks like your grand plan worked.
Here I am. And I…

1296
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:25,916
Pulled a twofer.

1297
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:27,291
Course you did.

1298
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:29,166
- Yeah.
- Sorry, do we know her?

1299
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,916
Oh, don't worry, she's a good guy.
Well, kind of a bad guy.

1300
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,791
She's a good bad guy.

1301
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:35,125
- We should go.
- Go.

1302
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:37,541
I'm gonna keep 'em busy,
erase all the footage…

1303
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:38,958
Hey, you. No, no, no.

1304
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,250
Hand over the Rolex.

1305
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:43,708
You have, like, a thousand.

1306
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:46,416
Thank you, good bad guy.

1307
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,666
Thank you. I knew you'd know what to do.

1308
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:54,208
Yeah. I was ready.
I just never pictured it with… kids.

1309
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:56,416
- Yeah.
- Your kids. But…

1310
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,791
I kind of like it.

1311
01:14:59,041 --> 01:14:59,875
Thank you.

1312
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:14,958
You live here? In downtown?

1313
01:15:15,291 --> 01:15:18,958
It's actually more of a safe house
that I keep for emergencies, but, yeah.

1314
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:21,333
That's so cool!
Dad, isn't that cool?

1315
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:24,583
Eh, is it cool?
Or is it fiscally irresponsible?

1316
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:27,291
You know, because rent downtown
is very expensive, son.

1317
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:29,291
Hey, thanks for sittin'
on the towel, bud.

1318
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:31,875
I appreciate you not getting vomit
on the Corinthian leather.

1319
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:35,333
- You understand, right?
- Yeah, I understand, Leo.

1320
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:37,291
Honey, how's your arm?
What happened?

1321
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,291
Oh, I don't know. It was a blur.

1322
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:43,166
Lot of fists were flying around.
And I think I punched a couple of guys.

1323
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:44,583
Uh, I mean...

1324
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:47,583
I think that may have happened
when you fell down, awkwardly.

1325
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:50,750
- Probably only a bruise.
- I think it's a bit more than a bruise.

1326
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:54,666
- Uh, maybe like a funny bone.
- Nah, I don't think it's a funny bone.

1327
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:55,666
Uh, you know.

1328
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,625
- Uh-huh.
- OK, well, you know.

1329
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:59,333
- I mean...
- Agree to disagree.

1330
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:02,208
Actually, I'm gettin' a bit numb,
so it's probably gonna affect my work.

1331
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:04,208
Oh. Uh, you're a surgeon?

1332
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:06,416
No, Leo. I am…

1333
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:10,791
A pastry chef, and I need my finger
strength and dexterity, so there you go.

1334
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:12,541
Is that a real Capicchioni?

1335
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:15,916
- We're all safe.
- You know that. Yeah, it is.

1336
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,083
- Can you play?
- Sure.

1337
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:21,291
There he goes, exposing more flesh.
Who is he doing that for?

1338
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,666
His arms are like Popeye's.
It's unbelievable.

1339
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:24,666
Alright.

1340
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,416
I activated emergency protocol.
We're all safe now.

1341
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,625
Just have to wait for Henry to contact me.

1342
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:31,291
How much is this worth, anyway?

1343
01:16:31,375 --> 01:16:33,958
I'd say somewhere
in the ballpark of 20 million.

1344
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:35,625
Crazy! Twenty million?

1345
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:37,541
We're giving it back.
It doesn't belong to us.

1346
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:41,666
But, Mom, you used to steal stuff
all the time when you were younger.

1347
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,166
- It was pretty cool.
- No.

1348
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,541
Why can't we just say we lost it
or something?

1349
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:48,875
Kev, listen to me. I was wrong.

1350
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:50,750
I paid a hefty price for it.

1351
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:53,166
And now,
it's put the people I love in danger.

1352
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:56,125
OK? I don't ever want any of you guys
doing anything I did.

1353
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:59,291
I made a lot of bad choices,
and hurt a lot of people.

1354
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:01,916
And we really regret it. Don't we, Leo?

1355
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,583
Well, eh…

1356
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,708
Of course, we do. We had to go into
witness protection to escape Jean-Paul.

1357
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:11,833
Well, actually,
<i>you </i>went into witness protection.

1358
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:14,250
I just couldn't get on board with that.

1359
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:17,666
With Jean-Paul away in prison,
which I have you to thank for,

1360
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:20,791
there was an opening
for a new Head of Operations.

1361
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:23,125
Whoa.

1362
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:26,041
- Mom, what's going on? Who is that?
- You remember Elise?

1363
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,583
She's with me. I sent her to get you.

1364
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:34,041
Oh! OK, I knew it.

1365
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:36,541
I knew he was a bad guy.
Well, how about this?

1366
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:38,083
Huh?

1367
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,666
How about that on your Corinthian leather?

1368
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:42,583
That's not cool, Ron.

1369
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:44,500
You're not cool.

1370
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,208
After we found you this time,

1371
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:49,583
with the help of that little meatball
and his video...

1372
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:52,333
Hey! Don't call my brother a meatball.

1373
01:17:52,416 --> 01:17:55,500
I knew the only way I was going to get you
to help me steal the crown

1374
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,833
was if you thought
our lives were in danger.

1375
01:17:57,916 --> 01:17:59,000
Your moral compass,

1376
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,750
always getting in the way
of us having a good time.

1377
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:04,375
- So you never went into protection.
- No.

1378
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:06,541
I mean, come on, admit it.

1379
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:08,375
You must be bored out of your mind.

1380
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:10,541
Driving carpool, going to Costco.

1381
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,416
You're happy with Strawberry Shortcake?
No offense, Ron.

1382
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:18,250
- Offense taken, Leo.
- You can't talk to our dad like that.

1383
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:20,250
The plan was simple in the beginning.

1384
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:23,333
Get you to help steal the crown,
frame you for it, then we disappear.

1385
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:24,375
But admit it…

1386
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:27,500
You had fun.

1387
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,541
Spark's still there.

1388
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:31,625
Come with me.

1389
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,375
What's it gonna be, Mathilde?

1390
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,125
You're right.

1391
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:45,125
Spark is still there.

1392
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:50,333
And the name is Margot.

1393
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:56,500
How about that, Leo? Margot and Ron.

1394
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:59,708
- Right? Like a power couple. Like Rargot.
- Gross.

1395
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:02,958
- We could be Rargot or Maron.
- Meet me at the dock when it's done.

1396
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:04,708
Baxter will have the boat ready.

1397
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:06,541
I believe this belongs to me.

1398
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:09,875
Well...

1399
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,208
I guess this is goodbye, Mathi...

1400
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:13,958
Margot.

1401
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:16,958
Have fun explaining this to the Feds.

1402
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,958
In the chair. Both of you.

1403
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,208
Yes, is this the police?

1404
01:19:24,291 --> 01:19:27,208
- Yes, I-I'm calling because…
- It's OK.

1405
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:30,250
I think I have some information
on somebody who's committed a crime.

1406
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:32,958
I think it's a... a couple.

1407
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,166
Um...

1408
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:39,250
I mean, it's a man and a woman,
and the woman is clearly the ringleader.

1409
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:42,000
Yeah, well,
she has blonde hair, blue eyes.

1410
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:45,666
Um, she's wearing a sparkly,
awful pink dress.

1411
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:47,125
And the man is…

1412
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:49,125
- What?
- Um, a mismatched...

1413
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:54,666
No, the woman is clearly the one
who's running the show. Yeah.

1414
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,458
Rain?
Why are you doing rain? It's not...

1415
01:19:57,541 --> 01:20:00,958
I'm hoping you can get here quickly,
because I'm not sure what to do.

1416
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:03,375
No, I'm just a neighbor,
I saw them walking in,

1417
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:05,875
I was just minding my own business…

1418
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,041
What hat? You need a hat?

1419
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:12,416
…I would say you should
bring everybody possible.

1420
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,833
- I got it.
- What?

1421
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:17,208
I got it.

1422
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,083
- I got this.
- There's so many.

1423
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,625
What are you doing?

1424
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,125
Oh!

1425
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,125
Mrs. Finch!

1426
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,750
- Yeah!
- Mom!

1427
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:42,166
Oh my God. No, no, no. Oh, man!

1428
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,541
Mom! Dad, do something!

1429
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:46,541
I got it. I got it.

1430
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:57,541
Honey, I-I have the gun.
Want me to throw it to you?

1431
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,916
- Shoot her!
- What? Shoot her? I...

1432
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,583
I-I-I can't shoot a gun.
I've never shot a gun before in my life!

1433
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:09,041
I could really use some help!

1434
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,958
OK, OK, OK.

1435
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,125
Oh no.

1436
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:22,500
Oh!

1437
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:24,708
- Hey, are you OK? Are you alright?
- Yeah.

1438
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:25,750
- OK.
- Ow!

1439
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:27,208
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

1440
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:28,625
Oh my God.

1441
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:31,958
I killed someone. I killed somebody.

1442
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:36,833
Dad, she's moving.

1443
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:39,875
- Yeah, she's moving!
- You didn't kill her!

1444
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:42,750
I didn't kill somebody.
Oh, she's waking up.

1445
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:46,333
We gotta go before Leo gets away,
or this whole thing becomes my mess.

1446
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:49,166
- Come on. Let's go!
- Right, right. Go, go, go.

1447
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:55,291
I can't believe you picked up that spider,
Mr. Finch. That was so brave!

1448
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:58,375
Oh, I don't know about brave, Lewis.
And I knew it was harmless.

1449
01:21:58,458 --> 01:22:02,000
Harmless? That was a wolf spider,
one of the most poisonous in the world.

1450
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:05,791
It had an egg sac on its back, too,
which is, like, millions of poison babies.

1451
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:06,916
Oh.

1452
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,083
Mom, no, no. This isn't our car.

1453
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:11,541
Oh my God, she's hot-wiring that car.

1454
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:15,416
Mom, you can hot-wire a car?

1455
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,791
Teach us to do that!

1456
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:18,666
No! You should never do this.

1457
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:21,375
OK, what if our phones are dead,
there's a zombie apocalypse,

1458
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:23,500
there's a virus going around,
then, can you...

1459
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:25,666
Kevin!

1460
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:28,708
Look, guys! Look, it's Leo.

1461
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:31,125
There he is!

1462
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:33,250
My God, Mom!

1463
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,000
We got it. Come on, get in!

1464
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:37,666
Come on.

1465
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:38,583
- Hey, honey!
- Yeah?

1466
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:40,375
- Leo was wrong about one thing.
- What?

1467
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:42,416
I'm the one who drives carpool.

1468
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,166
Yeah, you are.

1469
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:47,041
You got this!

1470
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:49,708
Let's save our family.

1471
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:52,500
Woo-hoo... Oh...

1472
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:55,291
- Look at this! This is limited edition!
- Alright.

1473
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:56,916
- Heated seats!
- Belts on.

1474
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:58,750
Nice, this is so nice.

1475
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,708
- Focus. We gotta go.
- Here we go.

1476
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:02,791
Not that way!

1477
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:04,333
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- Dad!

1478
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:06,375
- No! Mr. Finch!
- The adrenaline pumping.

1479
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:08,208
- Go!
- Honey, drive!

1480
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:09,375
Here we go!

1481
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:11,916
Oh, wow, this handles great!

1482
01:23:12,875 --> 01:23:14,458
Oh! This thing's got some pickup!

1483
01:23:14,541 --> 01:23:15,708
Limited edition!

1484
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:18,333
There he is!

1485
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:19,458
He's going left!

1486
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:25,833
This is an adrenaline rush for sure.

1487
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:27,166
You're doing great, honey.

1488
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:37,625
Oh! See how I took that turn?

1489
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:39,791
Cut the curb.
Don't swerve so big.

1490
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:40,750
Dad! What now?

1491
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:43,750
What? I don't know.
I hadn't thought that far in advance, pal!

1492
01:23:43,833 --> 01:23:44,875
What?

1493
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,416
- Dad, I have an idea.
- What?

1494
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:48,916
This is a laser pen. Maybe I could...

1495
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,250
What are you doing with a laser pen?

1496
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:54,041
No!

1497
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:55,500
Oh!

1498
01:23:56,916 --> 01:23:58,375
Oh, man!

1499
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,125
What is happening?

1500
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:02,666
Oh, no, I don't think that came from us.

1501
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:04,125
That was us!

1502
01:24:04,208 --> 01:24:06,208
- That was us.
- We'll leave a note.

1503
01:24:10,708 --> 01:24:12,041
OK. Here we go. I got him.

1504
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:15,416
Ron, watch out!

1505
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:26,625
We are all going to die.

1506
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:32,583
- Roll down the window. I have an idea!
- What? OK.

1507
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,125
Hey! Hey, Leo!

1508
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:40,000
Leo! You wanna dance
with the minivan, man?

1509
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:43,000
Well, check out this side-impact safety!

1510
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:44,375
What?

1511
01:25:00,708 --> 01:25:02,541
Everybody's OK? OK.

1512
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,791
I got Leo! You get the kids!

1513
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:06,958
- Uh, everyone OK?
- Yeah.

1514
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,666
Leo!

1515
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,833
Leo!

1516
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:17,541
I got him, honey. I got him.

1517
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:24,208
Oh, any excuse
to whip out the guns, right?

1518
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:25,750
- Uh...
- Mom?

1519
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:27,875
- Yeah?
- Dad might need you more than we do.

1520
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,041
I think you're right.

1521
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:34,666
I got him!

1522
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:42,375
Why are your fingers
so freakishly strong?

1523
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:45,416
Oh, you mean my incredible
finger strength and dexterity?

1524
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,208
I'm a pastry chef, Leo!

1525
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:52,375
I'm not going to jail.
I have lunch duty on Monday.

1526
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:20,500
Dude.

1527
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:21,666
- Dude!
- We did it!

1528
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,208
- Whoa.
- Yes!

1529
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:25,875
Don't mess with a pastry chef,
<i>or </i>his family,

1530
01:26:25,958 --> 01:26:28,166
'cause you will get the hammer!

1531
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,958
Yeah! You meatball!

1532
01:26:34,333 --> 01:26:36,291
You're my daughter alright.

1533
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:48,250
And then we went up
to this super cool house,

1534
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:50,458
but really, it was just his safe house.

1535
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:54,291
And then he told us that he's a bad guy
and not the good guy.

1536
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,916
- What?
- Yeah, basically, Leo...

1537
01:26:59,041 --> 01:26:59,916
So...

1538
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:01,708
wow.

1539
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:07,750
Wow. You certainly had an exciting life.

1540
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:10,791
- Before me.
- Yeah.

1541
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,208
You know, you, you...

1542
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,708
You and me, we were always…

1543
01:27:18,791 --> 01:27:22,958
I mean, I always knew you were
out of my league, but now I get it.

1544
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:24,625
I was your cover.

1545
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:26,750
Right?

1546
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,416
- This life we built...
- Honey, we are real.

1547
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,000
- We are?
- Yeah.

1548
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:33,916
Of course this is real.

1549
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,291
Yeah, no, I thought,
I mean, I thought so.

1550
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:45,000
I love you, and I love our family.

1551
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:48,166
Mr. and Mrs. Finch, my mom and dad
are gonna pick me up at eight o'clock.

1552
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:50,500
- Oh!
- Lewis, you're right.

1553
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:52,250
- Sugar balls.
- Yeah.

1554
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:56,083
- Henry!
- Henry!

1555
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:57,166
Angus!

1556
01:27:57,541 --> 01:27:59,083
Henry, we're comin' to you.

1557
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:03,666
Well, well, well.

1558
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:06,791
Old roommate Henry
from University of Nebraska.

1559
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,250
Go Huskers!

1560
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:10,791
Hope there's no hard feelings.

1561
01:28:13,416 --> 01:28:15,500
You know,
you were kind of a hero tonight.

1562
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:19,958
Seriously. You totally saved us
with the whole fake kid band story.

1563
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:22,166
Then when we were swimming, too.

1564
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:25,583
Ye-Ye-Yeah, but it wasn't, like,
a big deal or anything...

1565
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:28,541
No... it was a big deal, Kev.

1566
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:33,083
You're a really brave, kid.

1567
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:36,791
Oh my God.

1568
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:41,666
This was literally the craziest night
we are ever going to live...

1569
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:44,041
and I didn't post any of it.

1570
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:45,583
Waste.

1571
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:46,833
Hey.

1572
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:48,833
Um...

1573
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:52,500
I'm sorry. I've been kinda mean lately.

1574
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:56,041
I think, sometimes, I get jealous.

1575
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:57,541
Jealous of me?

1576
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,625
Yeah. I dunno. It's just...

1577
01:28:59,708 --> 01:29:02,375
It seems so easy for you
to be yourself,

1578
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:04,416
not care what anyone thinks.

1579
01:29:05,291 --> 01:29:06,916
I wish I could be more like that.

1580
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,083
I wish I could be more like you.
You're the best cellist ever.

1581
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:12,958
I mean, I'm not good at anything.

1582
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:16,000
What? You tell the most amazing stories!

1583
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:17,125
You're so creative.

1584
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:19,541
I mean, the stuff you make up, it's crazy,

1585
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:22,083
and-and weird, and smart.

1586
01:29:22,541 --> 01:29:26,416
- You're a pretty cool little brother.
- Thanks. You're a pretty awesome sister.

1587
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:33,958
Um, Mom…

1588
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:37,083
I wanna go to Boston.

1589
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:41,041
I want to apply to the Berklee School
of Music Summer Program.

1590
01:29:41,416 --> 01:29:42,916
And I know what you're gonna say.

1591
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,333
I'm too young,
I can't stay in the city by myself...

1592
01:29:45,416 --> 01:29:46,250
Yes.

1593
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:48,958
Y-Yes what?

1594
01:29:51,041 --> 01:29:53,166
Henry, I'm going through your files, OK?

1595
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:01,958
Wait, what? You were a musician?

1596
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:05,625
Not just a musician. You were a cellist.

1597
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,833
- Yeah.
- Wow.

1598
01:30:07,916 --> 01:30:10,291
The Pescatrici Quartet
wasn't just a crime syndicate.

1599
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:12,833
How do you think
we got into those fancy events?

1600
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:17,458
Berklee's one of the best programs
in the world, and you're ready for it.

1601
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:20,583
- Wait, for real?
- You're a fantastic cellist.

1602
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,708
I happen to know a thing or two
about that subject.

1603
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:26,708
I happen to know absolutely nothing
about that subject.

1604
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:28,666
But I do agree with your mom.

1605
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:30,333
You are fantastic.

1606
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,208
You're going to Boston.

1607
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:33,833
It's time.

1608
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,416
This mean I get a phone, too?

1609
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,583
- Yeah, sure.
- No.

1610
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:42,666
Oh, no.

1611
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,875
- Y-Yeah.
- Yeah. OK.

1612
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:47,375
To Boston!

1613
01:31:13,166 --> 01:31:14,000
Hey.

1614
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,833
Hi.

1615
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:18,541
You, um... you left your jacket
on Joey's boat.

1616
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:21,208
Right. Thank you.

1617
01:31:21,291 --> 01:31:22,625
How was the swim?

1618
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,583
Awful. Yeah.

1619
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:27,458
Well, it was a really nice jump.

1620
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:30,333
- Is that the senior?
- Glad to see you're not in jail.

1621
01:31:30,416 --> 01:31:32,208
- No, not in jail.
- Right. Yeah.

1622
01:31:35,166 --> 01:31:36,375
I'll talk to you at school.

1623
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:37,416
- See you.
- Bye.

1624
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:41,375
Hi, guys. Why are you all in costume?

1625
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:43,041
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

1626
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:43,958
Totally!

1627
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:46,333
- Yeah.
- Couldn't be better if you ask me.

1628
01:31:46,416 --> 01:31:48,375
Yeah, we're just watering the flowers.

1629
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,416
- No.
- Uh-oh.

1630
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,625
Lewis, there's obviously
something going on here...

1631
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:56,916
and I think I know what it is.

1632
01:31:58,625 --> 01:32:00,000
Mrs. Patoc, I can explain...

1633
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:03,125
Lewis, you forgot to wear
your special pee-pee underpants.

1634
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,333
Mom, I don't need 'em anymore.

1635
01:32:09,708 --> 01:32:10,625
Awesome sleepover.

1636
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:11,916
Totally.

1637
01:32:13,125 --> 01:32:13,958
Yeah!

1638
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:16,958
- Thanks for everything.
- Yep.

1639
01:32:17,041 --> 01:32:19,625
- Anytime.
- We should do it again sometime.

1640
01:32:19,708 --> 01:32:20,833
- Nope.
- Or not.

1641
01:32:20,916 --> 01:32:23,083
- Bye!
- Thanks, Mr. Finch.

1642
01:32:23,166 --> 01:32:24,333
- OK.
- Take care.

1643
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:25,750
That's it, right?

1644
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:28,250
We can get back
to our normal lives now, right?

1645
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:30,666
Probably.

1646
01:32:31,958 --> 01:32:32,791
Probably?

1647
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:35,750
- Probably?
- Gotta get these shoes off.

1648
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:38,583
OK, take them off,
then can you answer the question?

1649
01:32:38,666 --> 01:32:40,958
- I did.
- You said "probably," which means...

1650
01:32:41,041 --> 01:32:42,500
Yes, that's the answer.

1651
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:44,708
That implies there's more I need to know.

1652
01:32:44,791 --> 01:32:46,208
Any cupcakes left?

1652
01:32:47,305 --> 01:33:47,529

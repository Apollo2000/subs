"...and the raven,
never flitting,

3
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:11,760
still is sitting, still is sitting

4
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:14,263
on the pallid bust
of Pallas

5
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:16,266
just above my chamber door.

6
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,768
And his eyes have
all the seeming

7
00:03:18,836 --> 00:03:21,270
of the demons
that he's dreaming.

8
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:22,772
The lamp light streaming

9
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,776
throws his shadow
on the floor.

10
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:28,870
And my soul, from out that shadow,
that lies floating on the floor

11
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:32,383
shall be lifted...
nevermore."

12
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:37,723
Pretty good, huh?
Okay.

13
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,157
Read The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow.

14

You'll like it.

A teacher gets chased
by a headless demon.

16
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,641
Hi.

17
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,315
Can teachers be expelled
for kissing?

18
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:04,819
- They get fired.
- Thank God it's Friday.

19
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,820
You sound
like my students.

20
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,822
Why don't you
carry my books?

21
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,723
I hope you
haven't made plans.

22
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:15,230
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

23
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:52,666
You okay?

24
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:58,710
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

25
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:01,713
It didn't used
to bother me.

26
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,715
Enjoy the ride, folks?

27
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:16,930
Take it away.

28
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:54,096
Do you want to come in?

29
00:05:54,171 --> 00:05:56,435
I'd better not.

30
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,942
Are you all right?

31
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,875
I'm okay.

32
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,954
I had a wonderful time.

33
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:20,466
Are you sure you don't want
to come in?

34
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:23,469
You could spend
the night here.

35
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:26,972
I'd better not.

36
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,976
Some things are
worth waiting for.

37
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:38,318
My books.

38
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:46,260
Johnny, wait!

39
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,005
I'm so crazy about you.

40
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:59,837
I'm going to marry you.

41
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,843
You better.

42
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:16,192
- Drive carefully.
- I will.

43
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:10,920
Where's Intensive Care?

44
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:38,124
Johnny.

45
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:43,459
Johnny, don't leave me,
please.

46
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,035
Johnny, you're going to
get better. I know you are.

47
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:54,905
Can you hear me?

48
00:09:57,546 --> 00:10:00,140
We're going to get married.

49
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:02,150
Don't leave me.

50
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:57,872
Hello, John.

51
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:00,244
My name's Weizak.

52
00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:03,216
I'm Dr. Sam Weizak.

53
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:06,048
I'm the director
of this clinic.

54
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:09,249
You've been
our guest for a while.

55
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:12,794
Guest?

56
00:11:15,297 --> 00:11:18,061
That's a funny way
of putting it.

57
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:20,068
How do you feel?

58
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:25,441
My throat hurts.

59
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:30,746
Try a little water.

60
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:33,749
Come.

61
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:39,112
Hey, slow down.

62
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,351
Not so fast.
Slow down.

63
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:53,567
You've been involved
in a terrible traffic accident.

64
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,267
Do you remember?

65
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:00,878
Am I okay?

66
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:03,749
Well...

67
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:06,752
you've been
smashed up pretty badly.

68
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:13,760
What is it?

69
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,933
No bandages.

70
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:33,448
How come?

71
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,852
Your parents are here.

72
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,911
They're right next door.

73
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:43,857
I'll bring them in now.
Is that okay?

74
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:46,157
Sure.

75
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,969
Do come in.

76
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,602
Hi, Mom, Dad.

77
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:01,611
John.

78
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,379
Johnny.

79
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:09,387
Johnny, Johnny.

80
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,124
It's a miracle, John.

81
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,594
I know.

82
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,724
I was lucky. Look.

83
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,769
Not a scratch.

84
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,237
The Lord has delivered you
from your trance.

85
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,178
Remember what we discussed,
Mrs. Smith.

86
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:37,717
What is she
talking about?

87
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:39,275
Shh!

88
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:44,587
You've been in a coma,
Johnny. Not a trance.

89
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,594
Coma?

90
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,291
For how long?

91
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:53,994
We're just glad
to have you back.

92
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,506
Dad, how long?

93
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:04,246
Five years.

94
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:07,250
Five long years, John.

95
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:10,753
Lost for five years.

96
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:14,655
And now reborn unto me.

97
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:19,729
Five... years?

98
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:23,663
What about Sarah?

99
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:29,138
Cast her
from your thoughts.

100
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:33,235
She's turned
her back on you.

101
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:36,509
She cleaves now
unto another man,

102
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:38,516
a husband.

103
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:42,888
Husband?

104
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:02,638
- Amy.

105
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,281
Amy!

106
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:15,382
- Amy.
- Amy is my daughter's name.

107
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,054
Your daughter's screaming.
The house is burning.

108
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:21,597
Your daughter's
in the house.

109
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:24,225
It's not too late.

110
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:26,236
Amy.

111
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:29,203

is screaming.

Amy's screaming.
It's not too late.

115
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:49,256
Hurry up!

116
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,347
First, we will get your body
back into shape.

117
00:17:14,423 --> 00:17:17,085
Although you've
been exercised regularly,

118
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:20,094
the ligaments have shortened
a little.

119
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:22,995
Must I live
in a wheelchair?

120
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,000
Not permanently.

121
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:29,732
And not for very long.
Not if I can help it.

122
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:34,209
I, uh--
I won't deceive you, John.

123
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:37,372
Your therapy will be
long and painful.

124
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,483
But you will walk.

125
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,521
Thank you.

126
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:07,003
The wolf is loose.

127
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,775
John, are you all right?

128
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:17,683
No match for them.

Are you all right? Hmm?

137
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,605
Tell me...
what about the boy?

138
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:36,006
You keep saying,
"The boy is safe."

139
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:39,773
- What boy?
- You. You're the boy.

l am the boy?

141

- She saved you. She's alive, Sam.
- Who?

142
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:48,351
Your mother.

143
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:54,725
- No, that's not possible.
- She survived.

144
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:57,493
John, my mother is dead.

145
00:19:57,566 --> 00:20:02,868
She's alive. I know her name
and where she lives.

146
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:05,873
But that is
not possible, John.

147
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:08,877
How could you know that?
How--

148
00:20:10,313 --> 00:20:12,247
I'm scared, Sam.

149
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:17,252

Well...

you are either
in possession

back on your feet.

00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,602
No, I didn't.

172
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,763
I, um--

173
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,273
She came to the phone,

174
00:22:08,341 --> 00:22:11,538
but I just
couldn't talk to her.

175
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:13,545
I hung up.

176
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:15,479
Why?

177
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:17,483
Why?

178
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:23,189
Because it wasn't
meant to be.

179
00:22:23,257 --> 00:22:25,607
It wasn't meant to be.

180
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:29,644
Chug, chug, chug.
Come on. Keep it moving.

181
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:31,646
Weight down, knees up.

182
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,983
Keep it moving.

183
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:39,155
- That's it.
- That's it?

184
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:45,991
- That's what I get, 8 lousy steps?
- I counted 10.

185
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:49,555
I'd like you to do
some serious chugging.

186
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,660
I'm going to run
around the building.

187
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:55,171
- Keep chugging?
- Okay.

188
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,174
See you.

189
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,341
Johnny.

190
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,619
They told me
you were outside.

191
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:11,657
I am.

192
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:16,185
I didn't know
if I should come or not.

193
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:18,527
It's all right.

194
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,709
You got your hair cut.

195
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:32,712
Yeah, a long time ago.

196
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,714
You lost weight.

197
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:36,978
They call it coma diet--

198
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:39,213
lose weight while you sleep.

199
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,225
You know I got married.

200
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:47,558
I heard that.

201
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,732
You'd like him.

202
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:53,769
You still teach?

203
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:57,238
Uh-uh. Mothering's
a full time job.

204
00:23:57,307 --> 00:24:00,004
Kids, too?
I didn't know that.

205
00:24:00,077 --> 00:24:02,477
I'm sorry.

206
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:06,448
I thought your father
would have told you.

207
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:12,522
He's a wonderful little boy.
His name's Denny.

208
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:16,118
- How old is he?
- Ten months.

209
00:24:24,103 --> 00:24:26,537
I'm glad for you.

210
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:41,220
Don't look at me
like that.

211
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:44,223
What am I going to do?

212
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:46,226
For you,
five years have passed.

213
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:48,819
For me, it's the next day.

214
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:52,526
My feelings
haven't changed yet.

215
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,534
Oh, Johnny.

216
00:24:56,805 --> 00:24:59,673
Why did it
have to happen?

217
00:24:59,742 --> 00:25:02,233
Bad luck.

218
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:09,412
I never should have
let you go that night.

219
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:12,319
It was my idea,
remember?

220
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:14,857
What a jerk.

221
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:23,867
Everybody's
talking about you.

222
00:25:23,935 --> 00:25:26,870
You're the talk
of the town.

223
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:29,668
'Cause I got
my head bashed in

224
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:31,675
and I'm alive?

225
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:35,145
Because you have
the power of second sight.

226
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:37,205
Is it true, Johnny?

227
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:40,718
The papers
won't let up about it.

228
00:25:40,786 --> 00:25:43,448
I keep thinking
about a line

229
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:45,218
from The Legend
of Sleepy Hollow,

230
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:51,059
the last thing I gave my class
before the accident.

231
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:53,793
Ichabod Crane disappears.

232
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:56,735
The line goes,
"As he was a bachelor

233
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:58,738
and in nobody's debt,

234
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:02,242
nobody troubled their head
about him anymore."

235
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:05,244
Is that what
you're afraid of?

236
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:09,807
That's what I want.
That's what I want.

237
00:26:43,922 --> 00:26:46,186
I don't approve.

238
00:26:46,257 --> 00:26:49,192
The press
has been hounding me.

239
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,694
I want it over with.

240
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:55,700
Once you've set something
like this in motion,

241
00:26:55,768 --> 00:27:00,205
it seems you never know
where it will lead.

242
00:27:00,272 --> 00:27:02,206
It's already in motion.

243
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:04,640
I want to stop it.

244
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,702
They put it out,

245
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,214
and that's all there is.

246
00:27:09,282 --> 00:27:12,183
Clement Dardis,
WJGE-TV.

247
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:14,777
What happened to the girl?

248
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:17,450
I understand she's fine.

249
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:19,459
Well, uh...

250
00:27:19,527 --> 00:27:22,963
would you call this
a psychic experience?

251
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,091
- No, I would not.
- Ever had one before?

252
00:27:27,168 --> 00:27:29,103
No.

253
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:32,606
How about
a demonstration, John?

254
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:35,370
- A what?
- You know, a demonstration.

255
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:38,277
You got any predictions?

256
00:27:38,347 --> 00:27:40,281
You think Greg Stillson

257
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:43,285
is going to unseat
Senator Proctor?

258
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:45,878
- Who?
- Greg Stillson.

259
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,585
Uh... thank you, sir.

260
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,392
- No more.
- Wait, wait a minute!

261
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,399
How about the election?

262
00:27:56,467 --> 00:28:00,233
I don't even know
who you're talking about.

263
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:04,366
Well, you didn't know
anything about this nurse.

264
00:28:04,442 --> 00:28:06,376
That was different.

265
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:12,341
Well, I--

266
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,442
I touched her hand.

267
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,921
Oh. All right.
All right!

268
00:28:20,092 --> 00:28:22,686
Now, touch my hand.

269
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:27,028
Tell me,
is my house on fire, John?

270
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:30,069
- Shall I stop this?
- No.

271
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:36,042
You want to know
if you're going to die?

272
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:41,548
We'll all die. You want to know
if you'll die tomorrow.

273
00:28:41,616 --> 00:28:43,516
Is that right?

274
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:48,582
You want to know why
your sister killed herself.

275
00:28:48,656 --> 00:28:50,591
All right.
Go on.

276
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,059
- It's not all right.
- It's okay.

277
00:28:53,128 --> 00:28:55,790
It's not okay.

278
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:58,059
Okay.
I won't talk about that!

279
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:02,264
- Let go, you fucking freak!
- Please stop it!

280
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:04,034
Leave him alone!

281
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:06,803
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

282
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:09,777
You're hurting him!

283
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,626
Dr. Danvers, call 1522.

284
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:25,127
Dr. Danvers, call 1522.

285
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,131
Oh, yes, Nurse.

286
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,635
She knows you're coming.

287
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,442
Doctor, thanks for
bringing the boy.

288
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,994
Herb?

289
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:57,121
It's Johnny, Mom.

290
00:29:58,232 --> 00:30:01,828
Ohh...Johnny.

291
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:08,971
Leave your boots
outside the door.

292
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:14,278
Don't go tracking snow
all over the house.

293
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,284
I won't.

294
00:30:16,352 --> 00:30:18,912
You're a good boy.

295
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:06,702
You're wasting
your time here, Sheriff.

296
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,204
You know that,
don't you?

297
00:31:11,276 --> 00:31:13,710
Well, you never know, Frank.

298
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:15,712
It's worth a try.

299
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:28,220
- Mr. Smith?
- Yeah, I'm Herb Smith.

300
00:31:28,294 --> 00:31:32,230
Sheriff Bannerman,
Castle Rock. May I come in?

301
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:34,233
Yeah, sure. Come in.

302
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:39,238
It's a little nippy
out there.

303
00:31:41,308 --> 00:31:44,243
- That's a nice tree.
- Thanks.

304
00:31:44,311 --> 00:31:47,748
May I do something
for you, Sheriff?

305
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:51,251
Actually, I came
to see your son.

306
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,911
Are you John?

307
00:31:52,987 --> 00:31:55,421
Sheriff Bannerman.

308
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,125
Castle Rock.

309
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:02,129
I've come to you

310
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:05,428
with what you
could call a proposal.

311
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,436
It concerns
the Castle Rock Killer.

312
00:32:08,504 --> 00:32:13,134
- Have you heard of him?
- Sure.

313
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:20,617
I don't know whether
it's true or not, John...

314
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:23,619
about these psychic
powers of yours.

315
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:35,594
If it's true,
I could use your help.

316
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,192
Maybe you should
give him--

317
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:42,439
Think about it,

318
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:45,944
but bear in mind
some decent young women

319
00:32:46,012 --> 00:32:48,446
from homes just like this

320
00:32:48,514 --> 00:32:51,540
have met with terrible,
terrible deaths.

321
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:54,552
Now, I'm at my wits' end.

322
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,557
I've exhausted about every
approach to this situation.

323
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,991
I've come up with nothing.

324
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,065
I feel you can help me.

325
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,404
You made a mistake.

326
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:22,982
I was sorry to hear
about your mother's death.

327
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:25,179
I understand
she was a good woman,

328
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:27,586
Christian woman.

329
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:32,094
I'm not a religious man,
I'm sorry to say,

330
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:37,600
but if God has seen fit
to bless you with this gift,

331
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,601
you should use it.

332
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,707
Bless me?

333
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:48,108
You know
what God did for me?

334
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:51,114
He threw a truck at me,

335
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:54,448
bounced me into nowhere
for five years!

336
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,785
My girl was gone,
my job was gone,

337
00:33:58,857 --> 00:34:00,950
my legs are useless.

338
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:02,960
Bless me?

339
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:05,691
God's been a real sport to me.

340
00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:16,809
All right, John.

341
00:34:19,313 --> 00:34:23,545
If you change your mind,
you know where I am.

342
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:29,817
Merry Christmas to you.

343
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,641
Well?

344
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,344
Well what?

345
00:34:50,412 --> 00:34:52,847
See? What did I tell you?

346
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:11,658
Them murders,
god-awful things.

347
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:14,865
Went on during the time
you were in that coma.

348
00:35:17,943 --> 00:35:21,435
Don't have the knack
for tinsel.

349
00:35:21,513 --> 00:35:25,677
It was your mother who kept
the tree looking good.

350
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:30,445
I wish to God
she was here now

351
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:34,391
so she could talk to you
about this thing.

352
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,395
I'm not much help to you.

353
00:35:37,463 --> 00:35:39,398
Sure you are.

354
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:47,398
You, uh, want
to talk about it?

355
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:50,637
Not that much to say.

356
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:54,845
It don't bring you
much happiness.

357
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,850
When it happens...

358
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,446
when the spells come,

359
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:05,085
it feels like--
I don't know.

360
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:09,188
It feels like
I'm dying... inside.

361
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,810
No snow.

362
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:24,983
It should snow
for Christmas.

363
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:12,097
Hi.

364
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:15,331
I brought you a visitor.

365
00:37:15,404 --> 00:37:18,339
I didn't know
you were coming.

366
00:37:19,775 --> 00:37:21,709
I wasn't sure myself.

367
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:25,814
If I'd known
you were coming,

368
00:37:25,882 --> 00:37:27,816
I'd have cleaned up.

369
00:37:27,884 --> 00:37:29,943
You look wonderful.

370
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:34,357
You lost the crutches, I see.

371
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:37,292
Yeah.
I still got the limp.

372
00:37:39,464 --> 00:37:41,625
Is your father home?

373
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:44,793
He won't be back till later.

374
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:47,395
Is that who I think it is?

375
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,101
His Majesty.

376
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:53,042
- Danny?
- Denny.

377
00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:54,841
Say hi.

378
00:37:54,913 --> 00:37:56,847
Denny.

379
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,886
It's cold.
Come on in.

380
00:38:25,414 --> 00:38:27,348
He's asleep.

381
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:39,421
Last time
we were alone together,

382
00:38:39,495 --> 00:38:42,726
you said some things
were worth waiting for.

383
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:46,093
Well...

384
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,468
haven't we waited
long enough?

385
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:27,570
Charlene MacKenzie's
got Dad building things.

386
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:31,982
If you ask me, it's the company
she wants more than the bookcases.

387
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:33,987
I heard that.

388
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,062
That's a boy.

389
00:39:46,335 --> 00:39:48,269
There you are,
young fella.

390
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:51,500
I made that when
John was born.

391
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:53,507
It's an excellent chair.

392
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:57,945
What have you two
been up to all day?

393
00:39:58,014 --> 00:39:59,948
Making bookcases.

394
00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:06,055
Sit down.
Dinner's ready.

395
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:19,796
That smells good.
I'm starved.

396
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:24,103
- I hope you like it.
- He's fed up with my cuisine.

397
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,315
For our bounty,

398
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:33,318
may the Lord make us grateful.
Amen.

399
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:45,498
It feels good
to have a family

400
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:48,000
eating around
this table again.

401
00:41:03,117 --> 00:41:05,746
Will I see you again?

402
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:08,221
Not like today.

403
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,395
Go inside,
you're freezing.

404
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:17,229
- It doesn't have to--
- Don't say it.

405
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,598
Don't say it, Johnny.

406
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:25,740
I'll just say good night.

407
00:42:07,353 --> 00:42:09,651
Guess I'll hit the hay.

408
00:42:09,722 --> 00:42:12,282
I'm going to watch TV.

409
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:15,385
Good night, son.

410
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:17,794
Despite efforts
of police forces,

411
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:22,427
the killer is at large,
and is likely to remain so.

412
00:42:22,503 --> 00:42:25,803
We spoke to
Sheriff Bannerman

413
00:42:25,874 --> 00:42:27,808
outside the courthouse.

414
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:31,312
We have no new leads
at this time.

415
00:42:31,379 --> 00:42:33,813
However, there is the hope

416
00:42:33,882 --> 00:42:37,319
that some citizen might
have some information

417
00:42:37,386 --> 00:42:39,547
that would be very helpful.

418
00:42:39,622 --> 00:42:41,556
My line is open.

419
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:45,025
l'd welcome any help
we can get.

420
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:48,826
That's all I have to say.

421
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,333
Nine murders
have been attributed

422
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:55,531
to the Castle Rock Killer,
dating back almost 3 1/2 years.

423
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:58,699
The most recent victim

424
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:01,370
was 15 year old
Debbie Linderman,

425
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,346
a sophomore at
Castle Rock High School.

426
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:09,079
Her partially clad body
was found one month ago today.

427
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,590
Asin the other
Castle Rock killings,

428
00:43:12,658 --> 00:43:16,094
cause of death was
multiple stab wounds.

429
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,196
Next on News Eight,

430
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,596
sports and weather
with Ron,

431
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,602
after this message.

432
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:27,401
I'm going to help.

433
00:43:28,474 --> 00:43:30,499
What?

434
00:43:31,678 --> 00:43:35,114
The sheriff
that came here...

435
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,116
Bannerman.

436
00:43:39,687 --> 00:43:43,179
I'm going to help him.

437
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:45,191
We think the killer

438
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:49,629
hid down at the end
of the tunnel there.

439
00:43:49,698 --> 00:43:52,132
When the girl
came through,

440
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,135
the bastard was
waiting for her.

441
00:43:55,203 --> 00:43:57,637
Kids shouldn't
come through here,

442
00:43:57,706 --> 00:44:02,644
but they use this
as a short cut to school.

443
00:44:07,216 --> 00:44:09,150
He stood right here.

444
00:44:09,218 --> 00:44:13,155
Found a lot of cigarette butts,
same brand.

445
00:44:13,223 --> 00:44:15,657
Eight or nine butts here.

446
00:44:15,726 --> 00:44:17,660
This help you any?

447
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:21,164
I don't know.
Have you got something

448
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:24,167
he might have touched
or worn?

449
00:44:24,235 --> 00:44:26,669
Frank, give me
that package.

450
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:33,677
It's our only real evidence.

451
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:37,147
Found it in the bushes
back there.

452
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,150
Same brand as the butts.

453
00:44:42,755 --> 00:44:44,689
Here.

454
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:35,612
Nothing.

455
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:42,752
I thought I'd
feel something, but--

456
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,255
Can't say we didn't try.

457
00:45:45,323 --> 00:45:47,291
Dispatch to
Sheriff Bannerman.

458
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:52,763
Yeah, this is Bannerman.

459
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:54,765
We got another body.

460
00:45:56,335 --> 00:45:57,768
Oh...

461
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:00,499
damn it!

462
00:46:00,573 --> 00:46:02,507
What's the word?

463
00:46:02,575 --> 00:46:06,774
- Is it the Castle Rock Killer?
- Hey, Sheriff!

464
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,782
What's the word
about the robbery?

465
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,284
That's the psychic,
isn't it?

466
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,286
Give us a break.

467
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,790
We're trying
to do a story here.

468
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,293
You'll just have to wait.

469
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,795
Looks pretty grim to me.

470
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,804
Anyone know who she is?

471
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:33,398
Dodd?

472
00:46:48,124 --> 00:46:51,150
I know her.
Alma Frechette.

473
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:54,823
She works at
the Coffee Pot Cafe.

474
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:57,993
Was this psychic
your idea, George?

475
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,832
Get these people out of here.

476
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:04,363
Move them back.
Move the people back.

477
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:08,674
Knock it off with
those cameras. No more.

478
00:47:08,747 --> 00:47:10,772
- Dodd!
- Yeah?

479
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,451
- Nobody comes up here.
- You got it, Sheriff.

480
00:47:25,364 --> 00:47:27,298
You want to try?

481
00:48:09,412 --> 00:48:12,347
Hey, Alma!
Hi.

482
00:48:12,415 --> 00:48:14,349
What are you doing?

483
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:17,148
Waiting for
a smile from you.

484
00:48:17,221 --> 00:48:20,486
She knows him.

485
00:48:20,558 --> 00:48:23,026
What?

486
00:48:28,233 --> 00:48:30,326
She knows him.

487
00:48:39,445 --> 00:48:42,380
Why waste a smile on you?

488
00:48:42,448 --> 00:48:45,849
You want to see
the damndest thing?

489
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:49,377
- What?
- Come up to the gazebo.

490
00:48:56,964 --> 00:48:58,898
She knows him.

491
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,979
Not scared.
She knows him.

492
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:10,884
All right.

493
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:23,899
What did you
want to show me?

494
00:49:25,602 --> 00:49:29,538
Gazebo.
You like that word, Alma?

495
00:49:29,606 --> 00:49:31,540
Come here.

496
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:35,373
Look at this.

497
00:49:35,445 --> 00:49:38,313
Jesus! Let go!

498
00:49:38,382 --> 00:49:41,408
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- No joke.

499
00:49:57,502 --> 00:49:59,231
No, no! Wait!

500
00:50:01,007 --> 00:50:04,773
You all right?
Dodd, give me a hand.

501
00:50:04,844 --> 00:50:07,369
I saw him.
I was there.

502
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:11,179
- I saw his face.
- Who?

503
00:50:11,251 --> 00:50:15,449
I stood there and watched him
kill that girl. Dodd!

504
00:50:15,522 --> 00:50:18,013
- What are you saying?
- I did nothing.

505
00:50:18,092 --> 00:50:21,960
I stood there and watched him
kill that girl.

506
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:24,965
- What are you saying?
- Dodd!

507
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:30,265
I stood there.
I did nothing.

508
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,475
Dodd?

509
00:50:35,878 --> 00:50:38,039
Dodd, get up here!

510
00:50:38,114 --> 00:50:41,083
He took off in your car.

511
00:50:44,854 --> 00:50:49,383
I saw his face.
I saw his face.

512
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:08,311
You stay there.

513
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:33,839
Sheriff.

514
00:51:33,908 --> 00:51:37,901
I told you
to stay by the car.

515
00:51:37,978 --> 00:51:39,707
Who's there?

516
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,275
I want to talk
to your son, Mrs. Dodd.

517
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:46,479
He ain't here.

518
00:51:46,555 --> 00:51:49,547
His patrol car
is out here.

519
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:51,956
His car's here.
He ain't.

520
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:54,928
I saw him
in the window.

521
00:52:02,638 --> 00:52:05,698
- He ain't home!
- I'm coming in.

522
00:52:05,775 --> 00:52:07,710
No!

523
00:52:17,488 --> 00:52:20,151
Leave my boy alone!

524
00:52:25,396 --> 00:52:27,523
You knew.

525
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,329
Didn't you?

526
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,604
You knew.

527
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:36,266
You--

528
00:52:36,342 --> 00:52:38,902
You're a--

529
00:52:38,978 --> 00:52:41,208
You're a devil...

530
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,215
sent from hell!

531
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:46,385
Yes.

532
00:52:50,157 --> 00:52:52,284
Yes.

533
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,304
Frank?

534
00:55:29,897 --> 00:55:32,422
- No!

535
00:56:44,814 --> 00:56:46,748
Hello, John.

536
00:56:48,652 --> 00:56:50,711
May I come in?

537
00:57:08,774 --> 00:57:11,209
How did you find me?

538
00:57:11,277 --> 00:57:12,710
My father?

539
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:14,713
Stopped off to see him.

540
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:18,217
He said you moved
to a new town.

541
00:57:18,284 --> 00:57:20,309
He's worried about you.

542
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:22,082
And so am I.

543
00:57:22,156 --> 00:57:25,683
Don't worry.
I'm taking care of myself.

544
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,693
It's about time.

545
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:29,729
I'm still your doctor.

546
00:57:29,797 --> 00:57:32,231
You're still under my care.

547
00:57:32,299 --> 00:57:36,168
We have to...
well, stay in touch.

548
00:57:36,237 --> 00:57:38,398
Well--

549
00:57:38,473 --> 00:57:42,136
How's the, uh--
All healed up now?

550
00:57:43,945 --> 00:57:46,744
The bullet...

551
00:57:46,816 --> 00:57:48,750
went right through me.

552
00:57:48,818 --> 00:57:51,252
- It's nothing.
- Good.

553
00:57:54,156 --> 00:57:56,590
Nice place you have here.

554
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,598
It's home.

555
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:11,366
Those headaches
are getting worse, aren't they?

556
00:58:11,442 --> 00:58:14,741
Three, four times
a day sometimes.

557
00:58:16,848 --> 00:58:19,009
I brought you
some new medication.

558
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:21,848
No! No more pills.

559
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,016
It takes time to recover.
The healing process is slow.

560
00:58:26,091 --> 00:58:29,652
I'm not getting better.
I'm getting worse.

561
00:58:31,731 --> 00:58:34,256
Isn't that right?

562
00:58:40,773 --> 00:58:42,707
All right.

563
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:50,215
Now listen.
I've done some research

564
00:58:50,284 --> 00:58:53,219
into the area
of psychic phenomena.

565
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:57,952
Several cases, such as yours,
have been documented.

566
00:58:58,026 --> 00:58:59,960
I was surprised
to discover.

567
00:59:00,028 --> 00:59:03,464
And the pattern
is always the same.

568
00:59:03,532 --> 00:59:06,900
As the spells,
the visions,

569
00:59:06,969 --> 00:59:09,733
grow stronger
and more powerful,

570
00:59:09,805 --> 00:59:11,796
the body weakens.

571
00:59:11,874 --> 00:59:15,241
I don't need any research
or documentation

572
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:20,750
to see this thing is
sucking the life out of you.

573
00:59:20,817 --> 00:59:23,547
One look tells me that.

574
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:26,589
You mean I'm going to die?

575
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:29,851
How long?

576
00:59:29,928 --> 00:59:33,261
I think we can
arrest the process,

577
00:59:33,331 --> 00:59:35,299
reverse it even.

578
00:59:35,366 --> 00:59:37,561
- How?
- Come back with me.

579
00:59:37,635 --> 00:59:40,263
- Where?
- To the clinic.

580
00:59:40,338 --> 00:59:43,274
No. Absolutely no.

581
00:59:43,342 --> 00:59:45,276
John, please.
You must!

582
00:59:45,344 --> 00:59:47,574
So you can study me?

583
00:59:47,646 --> 00:59:50,774
No. So I can
protect you.

584
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:55,549
You need to be in
a controlled environment, John.

585
00:59:56,856 --> 00:59:59,416
I want to
show you something.

586
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,028
Come with me.

587
01:00:04,197 --> 01:00:07,133
Cards and letters
keep pouring in.

588
01:00:08,669 --> 01:00:10,637
What is all this?

589
01:00:10,705 --> 01:00:14,937
It's people with lost dogs,
lost children, lost lives.

590
01:00:15,009 --> 01:00:17,808
You haven't
even opened them.

591
01:00:17,879 --> 01:00:19,813
I don't have to.

592
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:22,816
They all want reassurance,
help, love...

593
01:00:22,884 --> 01:00:25,284
things I can't give them.

594
01:00:25,354 --> 01:00:29,189
Father sends it.
I let it pile up.

595
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,692
Why do you keep it?

596
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,594
This is why
I can't go out...

597
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:36,689
live my life,

598
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,702
why I stay
locked up here.

599
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:43,706
I'm already living in
a controlled environment, Sam.

600
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:48,210
Nothing can touch me here.

601
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:52,140
I'm alone.

602
01:00:53,518 --> 01:00:55,418
I'm safe.

603
01:00:57,222 --> 01:01:00,714
"But instead of dying,

604
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:05,730
she shall only
fall into...

605
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:08,232
a profound sleep

606
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:14,068
which shall last
a hundred years."

607
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:17,838
- That's my mom.

608
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:22,338
Okay.

609
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:26,016
- Bye.
- Bye.

610
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:27,645
John Smith?

611
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:34,192
Hi. I'm Roger Stuart.

612
01:01:34,262 --> 01:01:36,890
I'd like to talk to you.

613
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,274
Sit down.

614
01:01:52,348 --> 01:01:54,873
What can I do for you?

615
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:58,887
Um... it's, uh--

616
01:01:58,955 --> 01:02:01,891
It's my boy,
my son, Chris.

617
01:02:01,959 --> 01:02:04,894
He needs help.

618
01:02:04,962 --> 01:02:06,896
I've inquired around.

619
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:09,398
You come highly recommended.

620
01:02:10,634 --> 01:02:13,103
What's the matter with him?

621
01:02:13,171 --> 01:02:15,571
I wish I knew.

622
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,904
He's bright,
I know he is,

623
01:02:17,976 --> 01:02:21,412
but he won't
take part in school.

624
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,641
He won't join in.
He won't learn.

625
01:02:23,715 --> 01:02:26,844
God! He's so shy.

626
01:02:29,489 --> 01:02:32,515
You think you
could help him?

627
01:02:32,592 --> 01:02:35,720
I wouldn't know
unless I met him.

628
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:38,765
He wouldn't
come with me today.

629
01:02:38,832 --> 01:02:42,768
You'd have to come out
to the house.

630
01:02:42,836 --> 01:02:45,430
No. That's out
of the question.

631
01:02:45,506 --> 01:02:48,943
It's just not
the way I do it.

632
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:51,774
It won't work otherwise.

633
01:02:51,846 --> 01:02:53,871
Please.

634
01:02:53,948 --> 01:02:56,439
He'll get to know you,

635
01:02:56,518 --> 01:03:00,580
then you can bring
him here for the lessons.

636
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:02,590
Please.

637
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:05,490
Okay.

638
01:03:05,561 --> 01:03:07,859
Great. Tomorrow
morning's Saturday.

639
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:10,865
I'll send a car
to pick you up.

640
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:15,207
Thank you.

641
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:15,903
That reminds me of when
I ran for the senate.

642
01:04:15,973 --> 01:04:18,908
My opponent
went to the ghetto

643
01:04:18,976 --> 01:04:23,414
and handed out dollar bills
trying to buy votes.

644
01:04:23,481 --> 01:04:26,917
I said,
"You folks keep that money

645
01:04:26,985 --> 01:04:28,919
'cause times is rough.

646
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:33,925
But I want you to vote
for whoever you please."

647
01:04:33,993 --> 01:04:36,928
- We won by... what?
- 29.

648
01:04:36,996 --> 01:04:40,090
29 percentage points.
Those people spent that money

649
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:42,134
with a clear conscience.

650
01:04:45,005 --> 01:04:48,441
John, good morning.
Nice to see you.

651
01:04:48,508 --> 01:04:52,137
Gentlemen, meet my son's tutor,
John Smith.

652
01:04:52,212 --> 01:04:54,772
- This is Greg Stillson.
- Hello.

653
01:04:54,848 --> 01:04:57,784
- This gentleman is--
- Sonny Elliman.

654
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:01,288
Well, Greg,
you got some good ideas.

655
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:03,654
Let me think about them.

656
01:05:03,725 --> 01:05:07,719
Roger, I want you
to be part of this.

657
01:05:07,796 --> 01:05:12,460
I need your support,
your expertise, your input.

658
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,367
And most importantly,
I need your money.

659
01:05:15,437 --> 01:05:19,340
- God bless, Roger.
- Thanks for dropping by.

660
01:05:19,409 --> 01:05:21,673
See you. Bye-bye.

661
01:05:21,745 --> 01:05:24,714
My God!
What a glorious day!

662
01:05:25,949 --> 01:05:27,883
Amen.

663
01:05:31,956 --> 01:05:34,891
Sorry about that.

664
01:05:34,959 --> 01:05:37,291
Well, let's go see Chris.

665
01:05:40,464 --> 01:05:43,662
Chris.
This is Johnny.

666
01:05:43,735 --> 01:05:47,535
Remember I said
he was coming?

667
01:05:48,807 --> 01:05:52,243
I'll leave you alone
to get acquainted.

668
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,941
Your father wants me

669
01:06:21,009 --> 01:06:24,445
to bring you
out of your shell.

670
01:06:25,513 --> 01:06:28,448
I don't know what to do.

671
01:06:28,516 --> 01:06:31,452
You don't have
to do anything.

672
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,388
My dad lives in a shell,
not me.

673
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:21,829
Chris has really
taken to you, John.

674
01:07:21,908 --> 01:07:24,900
- You made progress.
- We just talked.

675
01:07:24,978 --> 01:07:27,914
Well, with Chris,
that's an achievement.

676
01:07:27,982 --> 01:07:29,882
You want a drink?

677
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,418
- No.
- Want a beer?

678
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:35,353
- Okay.
- Get him a beer.

679
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:48,492
Let's listen to this.

680
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,094
99...

681
01:07:50,172 --> 01:07:52,107
100!

682
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:55,943
l'm Greg Stillson,

683
01:07:56,012 --> 01:08:00,949
just stopping by
on my way to the U. S. Senate.

684
01:08:01,017 --> 01:08:02,952
Greg Stillson.

685
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:05,454
Remember you met him
this morning?

686
01:08:05,522 --> 01:08:07,956
...you got to be
in good shape

687
01:08:08,025 --> 01:08:13,726
to go the full distance
with those boys in Washington.

688
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:17,700
What the hell is happening
to this country?

689
01:08:17,769 --> 01:08:19,964
Can anybody tell me?

690
01:08:20,038 --> 01:08:22,700
I read in a localpaper--

691
01:08:22,774 --> 01:08:25,242
Do you believe this guy?

692
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:28,610
He's just getting
warmed up.

693
01:08:28,681 --> 01:08:30,615
You voting for him?

694
01:08:32,985 --> 01:08:34,919
I'm not even registered.

695
01:08:34,987 --> 01:08:37,718
- Not registered?
- No.

696
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:41,090
Get registered, pal,
and vote against this turkey.

697
01:08:41,161 --> 01:08:43,152
He's dangerous.

698
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:45,425
...I see so many unemployed.

699
01:08:45,499 --> 01:08:50,437
Why are you people here
in the middle of the day?

700
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:52,439
Look at each other!

701
01:08:52,507 --> 01:08:54,441
How do you feel?

702
01:08:54,509 --> 01:08:58,946
Would you send your friend
to the U. S. Senate?

703
01:08:59,013 --> 01:09:01,949
A real man of the people.

704
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:05,043
Jesus, what an act.

705
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,953
Can't they see
through this guy?

706
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:10,491
You acted like friends
this morning.

707
01:09:10,559 --> 01:09:12,960
With guys like Stillson,

708
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:15,463
you walk a thin line.

709
01:09:15,532 --> 01:09:18,968
If they lose,
they'll drag you down.

710
01:09:19,035 --> 01:09:23,472
But if he wins,
and this turkey just might,

711
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:27,807
you make sure you're thought of
as a good friend.

712
01:09:27,878 --> 01:09:31,041
Know what I mean?

713
01:09:31,115 --> 01:09:33,982
...l've got a job for everyone

714
01:09:34,051 --> 01:09:37,488
and a challenge for all of you!

715
01:09:37,556 --> 01:09:40,491
l'm challenging you
to join me,

716
01:09:40,559 --> 01:09:42,993
to join a growing army

717
01:09:43,061 --> 01:09:46,729
of volunteer workers
on my campaign.

718
01:09:46,864 --> 01:09:49,958
Let's send Greg Stillson
to the U. S. Senate

719
01:09:50,034 --> 01:09:51,968
and mediocrity to hell!

720
01:10:18,264 --> 01:10:21,062
What can I do for you boys?

721
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:25,332
You work late.
That's admirable.

722
01:10:25,405 --> 01:10:27,600
I'm Greg Stillson.

723
01:10:27,674 --> 01:10:32,008
I know who you are,
Mr. Stillson.

724
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:35,516
Take your paid gorilla
and get out.

725
01:10:38,086 --> 01:10:42,045
We've got a little problem here.

726
01:10:42,123 --> 01:10:44,751
Get to the point,
Mr. Stillson.

727
01:10:44,826 --> 01:10:47,990
I'm damned near even
in the polls.

728
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,997
The people need me.

729
01:10:50,065 --> 01:10:52,397
I'm going to win big.

730
01:10:52,468 --> 01:10:54,402
I've had a vision

731
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:59,408
that I'm going to be President
of the United States someday.

732
01:10:59,476 --> 01:11:01,410
I've accepted
that responsibility,

733
01:11:01,478 --> 01:11:03,605
and nobody,

734
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,114
will stop me.

735
01:11:09,487 --> 01:11:11,421
Imagine how I felt

736
01:11:11,489 --> 01:11:13,923
when I read your editorial

737
01:11:13,991 --> 01:11:16,425
that's hitting
the streets tomorrow.

738
01:11:16,494 --> 01:11:19,429
You don't seem
to like me, Brenner.

739
01:11:19,497 --> 01:11:21,432
But that's okay.

740
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,934
I don't like you either.

741
01:11:24,002 --> 01:11:26,766
How did you get that?

742
01:11:26,838 --> 01:11:32,072
I'm not at liberty
to reveal my sources.

743
01:11:32,145 --> 01:11:34,443
It doesn't make
any difference.

744
01:11:34,514 --> 01:11:38,245
That editorial is hitting
the streets tomorrow morning.

745
01:11:38,317 --> 01:11:40,751
Not if we make a deal.

746
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:43,312
What's that mean?

747
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:46,951
You staying out of
the campaign business,

748
01:11:47,027 --> 01:11:50,963
and me staying out
of the publishing business.

749
01:11:51,031 --> 01:11:54,467
Show him what
we've got to publish.

750
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:03,204
That's your best shot.

751
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:07,147
I got many loyal people
on my side--

752
01:12:07,216 --> 01:12:10,344
Like that lady in
the photograph with you.

753
01:12:10,419 --> 01:12:13,354
I never met Mrs. Brenner,

754
01:12:13,422 --> 01:12:15,822
but I'm sure
that ain't her.

755
01:12:15,891 --> 01:12:18,793
What do you think, Sonny?

756
01:12:25,735 --> 01:12:27,669
Is this Mrs. Brenner?

757
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:38,173
- Doesn't look like her.
- You son of a bitch!

758
01:12:38,249 --> 01:12:40,843
Who you calling
a son of a bitch?

759
01:12:40,918 --> 01:12:45,015
Let's give
Mr. Brenner a chance

760
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:48,025
to think about
his wife, kids,

761
01:12:48,093 --> 01:12:50,527
his position
in the community.

762
01:12:59,606 --> 01:13:02,837
What if I don't make a deal?

763
01:13:02,909 --> 01:13:04,878
You'll make a deal.

764
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:08,745
Otherwise Sonny
will take your head off.

765
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:15,054
Good idea.

766
01:13:15,122 --> 01:13:19,059
I told you he was
a reasonable man.

767
01:13:19,127 --> 01:13:21,061
He's a nice man.

768
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:23,063
I like your wife too.

769
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:32,406
"Prophets, said I,
thing of evil.

770
01:13:32,475 --> 01:13:34,909
Prophets still
of bird or devil,

771
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:37,912
by that heaven
that bends above us,

772
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,415
by that God
we both adore,

773
01:13:40,484 --> 01:13:42,918
tell this soul
with sorrow laden,

774
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:44,920
if within
the distant Aden,

775
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:47,081
it shall clasp
a sainted maiden

776
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:49,455
whom the angels
named Lenore."

777
01:13:49,526 --> 01:13:52,223
Skip to the part
where he talks about,

778
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:54,697
"Will I ever
see her again?"

779
01:13:56,467 --> 01:13:58,765
"Eagerly I wish the morrow.

780
01:13:58,836 --> 01:14:01,100
Vainly I had sought
to borrow

781
01:14:01,172 --> 01:14:03,607
from my books,
surcease of sorrow,

782
01:14:03,676 --> 01:14:05,610
sorrow for
the lost Lenore.

783
01:14:05,678 --> 01:14:08,112
For the rare
and radiant maiden

784
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:10,114
whom the angels
named Lenore,

785
01:14:10,182 --> 01:14:12,116
nameless here forevermore."

786
01:14:14,486 --> 01:14:17,388
Stop. I'll be right back.

787
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:28,134
Good afternoon, sir.

788
01:14:28,202 --> 01:14:31,137
We're out talking
about Greg Stillson.

789
01:14:31,205 --> 01:14:33,639
You're familiar
with our candidate?

790
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:36,142
What do you think?

791
01:14:37,612 --> 01:14:39,638
Yeah, right.

792
01:14:39,715 --> 01:14:44,015
Are you aware of what
Greg Stillson stands for?

793
01:14:44,086 --> 01:14:48,147
Greg Stillson's mounting
a successful third party movement.

794
01:14:48,223 --> 01:14:52,160
Stillson represents
both the poor and the well-off.

795
01:14:52,228 --> 01:14:56,164
Could you come back?
I have a student.

796
01:14:56,232 --> 01:14:59,395
Sure. You're busy.
Can I leave some literature?

797
01:14:59,469 --> 01:15:01,529
Honey, bring some brochures!

798
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:21,184
Hello, Johnny.

799
01:15:25,831 --> 01:15:27,765
Hi.

800
01:15:29,001 --> 01:15:31,561
You live here?

801
01:15:31,637 --> 01:15:34,435
Yeah. I'm back to teaching.

802
01:15:34,507 --> 01:15:37,033
This is my husband Walt.

803
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:40,045
Nice to meet you
finally, John.

804
01:15:40,113 --> 01:15:43,048
Sarah's talked
about you often.

805
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,714
Come on back, Johnny.

806
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,054
It's no fun reading alone.

807
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:53,821
Chris,
Walt and Sarah.

808
01:15:53,895 --> 01:15:55,863
Hi.

809
01:15:57,465 --> 01:16:00,902
We'll let you
get back to work.

810
01:16:02,838 --> 01:16:04,965
Nice to meet you.

811
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,600
Don't forget
who to vote for.

812
01:16:15,385 --> 01:16:17,353
Bye.

813
01:16:25,663 --> 01:16:27,096
Who was that?

814
01:16:32,169 --> 01:16:34,103
Hey.

815
01:16:34,171 --> 01:16:36,106
You okay?

816
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:42,946
Why are you crying,
Johnny?

817
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:48,119
Johnny?

818
01:17:25,812 --> 01:17:27,746
What's the matter?

819
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:29,748
- Nothing.

820
01:17:29,816 --> 01:17:34,015
- My ride's here.
- I'm going with you.

821
01:17:43,698 --> 01:17:47,635
- I got to talk to you.
- Hi, Johnny.

822
01:17:47,703 --> 01:17:50,399
- What are you doing?
- Pretty good stuff, huh?

823
01:17:50,472 --> 01:17:53,873
I organized
a hockey team.

824
01:17:53,943 --> 01:17:57,175
We're practicing this afternoon.
I'm the coach.

825
01:17:57,247 --> 01:17:59,010
Call it off.

826
01:17:59,082 --> 01:18:02,381
There's going
to be an accident.

827
01:18:02,452 --> 01:18:06,650
Call it off?
Chris is looking forward to this.

828
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:10,455
- He's really coming out, John.
- Wait.

829
01:18:10,528 --> 01:18:13,656
I got to talk to you.

830
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:17,666
Eat something,
then we'll go.

831
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:22,196
There's going to be an accident.
Call it off.

832
01:18:22,274 --> 01:18:25,038
We skate on that pond
until March.

833
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:27,670
You'll kill your own son!

834
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:29,577
I'm scared, Dad.

835
01:18:29,648 --> 01:18:31,708
For Christ sake, John!

836
01:18:31,784 --> 01:18:34,048
Don't be scared.
Go eat.

837
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:37,055
Don't you know who I am?

838
01:18:37,123 --> 01:18:41,719
You think I'd hire you
without checking you out?

839
01:18:41,794 --> 01:18:45,322
I hired you as a teacher,
not a fortuneteller.

840
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:53,636
The ice is going to break!

841
01:18:53,707 --> 01:18:55,869
I want you out.

842
01:18:55,944 --> 01:18:59,436
I don't want you
in my boy's life !

843
01:18:59,514 --> 01:19:03,348
You do exactly
what I'm telling you!

844
01:19:03,418 --> 01:19:06,479
No, Dad.
You don't know.

845
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:08,921
It's not safe.

846
01:19:10,659 --> 01:19:13,594
All right.
To hell with it!

847
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:17,326
Forget everything,
but I want you out.

848
01:19:17,401 --> 01:19:20,768
Whatever you say.
I'm sorry about that.

849
01:19:20,837 --> 01:19:23,601
I'll send your final check.

850
01:19:23,673 --> 01:19:26,005
I'm not crazy, you know.

851
01:19:26,076 --> 01:19:29,444
Don't let the boy
think I am.

852
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,505
I'm right about this.

853
01:19:31,582 --> 01:19:34,517
But we'll never know,
will we?

854
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:39,456
Give me your hand.

855
01:19:49,935 --> 01:19:52,370
Nothing to worry about now.

856
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:55,374
My driver will
take you home.

857
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:59,044
You were right.

858
01:20:03,616 --> 01:20:05,551
I'll see you.

859
01:20:15,296 --> 01:20:17,231
Chris?

860
01:20:19,768 --> 01:20:21,895
Hey, what's going on?

861
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:23,904
You're not even dressed.

862
01:20:26,808 --> 01:20:28,743
You called it off.

863
01:20:28,811 --> 01:20:31,746
I thought you
called it off.

864
01:20:31,814 --> 01:20:34,578
Just to get rid of him.

865
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:36,584
We going or not?

866
01:20:38,654 --> 01:20:42,591
Are you going
to pout like a baby

867
01:20:42,659 --> 01:20:46,595
or come and play hockey
with your friends?

868
01:20:50,668 --> 01:20:52,602
Great.

869
01:21:59,709 --> 01:22:01,610
Hello.

870
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,840
Who is it?

871
01:22:04,815 --> 01:22:07,010
Johnny.

872
01:23:18,662 --> 01:23:22,099
- Sarah, see you down there.
- Okay.

873
01:24:43,381 --> 01:24:45,315
Stillson! Stillson!

874
01:24:47,652 --> 01:24:49,586
Stillson! Stillson!

875
01:24:49,654 --> 01:24:52,384
Stillson! Stillson!

876
01:24:57,897 --> 01:24:59,831
Stillson! Stillson!

877
01:25:03,869 --> 01:25:05,769
Stillson! Stillson!

878
01:25:05,838 --> 01:25:07,773
Stillson! Stillson!

879
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:12,244
Stillson! Stillson!

880
01:25:14,181 --> 01:25:16,081
Stillson! Stillson!

881
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:18,414
Stillson! Stillson!

882
01:25:21,923 --> 01:25:23,857
Good to see you.

883
01:25:26,093 --> 01:25:27,958
Hi. How are you?

884
01:25:28,029 --> 01:25:29,861
Good to see you.

885
01:25:29,932 --> 01:25:31,957
Hi. How are you?

886
01:25:32,034 --> 01:25:36,266
How you doing?
Good to see you.

887
01:25:46,049 --> 01:25:47,812
Do it, General.

888
01:25:47,884 --> 01:25:49,818
You're insane.
I won't.

889
01:25:49,886 --> 01:25:54,790
Do it! You'll go down
in history with me!

890
01:25:54,859 --> 01:25:58,295
As what? The world's
greatest mass murderers?

891
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:00,227
You cowardly bastard!

892
01:26:00,297 --> 01:26:03,164
You're not the voice
of the people!

893
01:26:03,234 --> 01:26:05,465
The people speak through me!

894
01:26:05,537 --> 01:26:10,133
It came to me while I slept--
my destiny.

895
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:14,167
I must get up now
and fulfill my destiny!

896
01:26:14,246 --> 01:26:18,650
Put your hand on that,
or I'll hack it off!

897
01:26:18,718 --> 01:26:20,652
Do it!

898
01:26:32,933 --> 01:26:34,867
May God forgive me.

899
01:26:45,146 --> 01:26:47,137
Congratulations, General.

900
01:26:49,784 --> 01:26:52,720
Complete the sequence,
Mr. President.

901
01:27:11,441 --> 01:27:13,500
My destiny.

902
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:23,753
Thank you, Sonny.

903
01:27:32,097 --> 01:27:34,930
Let them come up.

904
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:39,772
Mr. President, we have
a diplomatic solution.

905
01:27:39,839 --> 01:27:42,273
Mr. Vice President,
Mr. Secretary,

906
01:27:42,342 --> 01:27:44,606
the missiles are flying.

907
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:47,771
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.

908
01:27:53,654 --> 01:27:56,020
You okay, Greg?

909
01:27:58,158 --> 01:28:00,922
Get out!

910
01:28:00,995 --> 01:28:02,930
Stillson! Stillson!

911
01:28:02,998 --> 01:28:05,831
Stillson! Stillson!

912
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:08,391
Stillson! Stillson!

913
01:28:18,214 --> 01:28:22,548
If you could go back
in time to Germany,

914
01:28:22,618 --> 01:28:25,315
before Hitler came to power,

915
01:28:25,389 --> 01:28:27,823
knowing what you know now,

916
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:30,382
would you kill him?

917
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:34,021
Is that why
you sent for me,

918
01:28:34,097 --> 01:28:37,329
to ask me this, uh...
this question?

919
01:28:41,406 --> 01:28:44,842
I have to talk
to you, Sam,

920
01:28:44,909 --> 01:28:48,209
because I've had
another episode.

921
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,214
Oh, yes?

922
01:28:50,282 --> 01:28:53,149
Go on.

923
01:28:53,218 --> 01:28:56,813
I've been tutoring
this boy named Stuart.

924
01:28:56,889 --> 01:29:00,155
In the vision,
I saw him drown.

925
01:29:00,226 --> 01:29:02,717
But that's
not the point.

926
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:05,822
In the vision,
something was missing.

927
01:29:05,899 --> 01:29:08,697
How-- How do you mean?

928
01:29:08,768 --> 01:29:13,934
It was like... a blank spot,
a dead zone.

929
01:29:19,914 --> 01:29:22,508
First of all, tell me,

930
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:25,678
did the boy in fact drown?

931
01:29:25,754 --> 01:29:28,450
His father wanted him
to play hockey.

932
01:29:28,523 --> 01:29:30,787
I talked him out of it.
The boy's alive.

933
01:29:30,859 --> 01:29:35,695
Ah. Yes.

934
01:29:35,765 --> 01:29:39,201
Don't you see
how clear it is?

935
01:29:39,268 --> 01:29:44,103
Not only can you
see the future, you can--

936
01:29:44,173 --> 01:29:47,610
- I can change it.
- You can change it, exactly.

937
01:29:49,179 --> 01:29:51,272
Here.

938
01:29:53,851 --> 01:29:57,446
Yes, John.
That is your-- your dead zone.

939
01:29:57,521 --> 01:29:59,547
The possibility of...

940
01:29:59,624 --> 01:30:03,458
of altering the outcome
of your premonitions...

941
01:30:03,528 --> 01:30:07,464
it's fascinating.
Let me make a note.

942
01:30:09,201 --> 01:30:12,227
What about my question?

943
01:30:12,304 --> 01:30:14,795
Huh?

944
01:30:14,874 --> 01:30:18,640
Oh, you mean
the one about Hitler?

945
01:30:18,711 --> 01:30:22,478
- What would you do?
- I don't like this.

946
01:30:22,549 --> 01:30:24,915
What are you getting at?

947
01:30:24,985 --> 01:30:28,477
What would you do?
Would you kill him?

948
01:30:31,725 --> 01:30:33,660
All right.

949
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:37,164
All right.
I'll give you an answer.

950
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:39,791
I'm a man of medicine.

951
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:43,826
I'm expected to save lives
and ease suffering.

952
01:30:43,905 --> 01:30:45,840
I love people.

953
01:30:45,908 --> 01:30:48,342
Therefore,
I would have no choice

954
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:52,346
but to kill
the son of a bitch.

955
01:30:58,755 --> 01:31:01,189
You'd never get away alive.

956
01:31:01,257 --> 01:31:04,693
It doesn't matter.
I would kill him.

957
01:31:04,761 --> 01:31:07,227
Nasdro via. Skol.

958
01:32:31,653 --> 01:32:33,587
"Dear Sarah,

959
01:32:33,655 --> 01:32:37,250
lt is a hard letter to write,

960
01:32:37,325 --> 01:32:39,691
so I'll make it short.

961
01:32:39,761 --> 01:32:43,095
I can't go on hiding anymore.

962
01:32:43,165 --> 01:32:45,599
That's what l've been doing--

963
01:32:45,668 --> 01:32:47,602
running and hiding.

964
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:50,264
I had this
figured out all wrong.

965
01:32:50,339 --> 01:32:54,276
I always thought
my power was a curse,

966
01:32:54,344 --> 01:32:58,280
but now I can see it 's a gift.

967
01:32:58,348 --> 01:33:01,784
By the time you get this letter,

968
01:33:01,852 --> 01:33:03,786
it'll be all over.

969
01:33:03,855 --> 01:33:06,289
You never will understand why.

970
01:33:06,357 --> 01:33:10,794
Nobody ever will,
but I know what I'm doing.

971
01:33:10,862 --> 01:33:13,126
And I know I'm right.

972
01:33:13,197 --> 01:33:19,068
Just remember there's never
been anyone for me except you.

973
01:33:20,706 --> 01:33:25,143
Just wasn't in the cards
for us, I guess.

974
01:33:25,210 --> 01:33:27,441
I'll always love you,
Sarah.

975
01:33:27,514 --> 01:33:29,448
Johnny."

976
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:41,817
How you doing?

977
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:55,471
Thanks very much.
What's your name?

978
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:58,476
Greg, my husband Walt.

979
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:00,978
Hi, Walt.
This your baby?

980
01:36:02,215 --> 01:36:04,615
Bring him up on stage.

981
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:19,157
I want to thank you
for the support

982
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:21,166
you've given this campaign.

983
01:37:21,234 --> 01:37:24,431
You made this campaign
the most exciting,

984
01:37:24,504 --> 01:37:28,998
the most important campaign
in this state's history.

985
01:37:29,075 --> 01:37:32,409
I've come here personally
to thank you for that.

986
01:37:42,156 --> 01:37:44,057
Johnny!

987
01:37:48,496 --> 01:37:50,430
Give me him!

988
01:37:50,498 --> 01:37:52,295
Don't!

989
01:37:52,367 --> 01:37:54,528
No!

990
01:37:54,603 --> 01:37:57,471
Sonny! The man's
trying to kill me!

991
01:38:37,072 --> 01:38:39,700
You son of a bitch!

992
01:38:39,774 --> 01:38:42,835
Who sent you?
Huh?

993
01:39:07,138 --> 01:39:09,299
It's over.

994
01:39:13,711 --> 01:39:16,009
You're finished.

995
01:39:18,884 --> 01:39:21,546
Where's that kid
with the camera?

996
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:23,713
I don't see him.

997
01:39:23,789 --> 01:39:25,484
You asshole!

998
01:39:34,834 --> 01:39:37,803
It's okay.
It's all right.

999
01:39:52,354 --> 01:39:54,720
Oh, Johnny, why?

1000
01:39:55,791 --> 01:39:57,725
Why?

1001
01:40:02,999 --> 01:40:04,990
Good-bye.

1002
01:40:08,704 --> 01:40:10,672
I love you.

1003
01:40:11,305 --> 01:41:11,203

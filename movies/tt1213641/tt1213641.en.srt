with candidates about the program.</i>

177
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:51,328
As you know, our decision to forgo direct ascent
in favor of a lunar orbit rendezvous approach

178
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:54,533
to the eventual Moon mission has
had a major impact on Gemini.

179
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:57,235
Do you have any thoughts on that decision?

180
00:16:57,236 --> 00:17:00,305
Well, even considering von
Braun's initial criticism,

181
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:04,976
it seems that the payload saved by
parking the primary vehicle in orbit

182
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:09,882
and sending a smaller ship down to the lunar
surface is well worth the resulting challenges.

183
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:13,684
- What do you see as the challenges?
<i><font color=#FF551>- NEIL:</font> Cislunar navigation, for one.</i>

184
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:17,956
- And rendezvous and docking.
- Why do you think space flight's important?

185
00:17:19,691 --> 00:17:26,097
I had a few, uh, opportunities in the
X-15 to observe the atmosphere.

186
00:17:26,098 --> 00:17:32,104
It was so thin, such a small part of the
Earth, you could barely see it at all.

187
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:33,685
<i>And when you're down here in the crowd</i>

188
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:39,109
and you look up, it... it looks pretty big, and
you don't think about it too much, but...

189
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,816
when you get a different vantage point,
it changes your... perspective.

190
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:50,102
I don't know what space
exploration will uncover,

191
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:55,760
but I don't think it'll be exploration
just for the sake of exploration.

192
00:17:55,761 --> 00:18:00,933
I think it'll be more the fact that
it... allows us to see things

193
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:04,803
that maybe we should have seen a long time ago

194
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:09,775

<i><font color=#FF551>- MAN:</font> Yeah.</i>

you think it will have an effect?

199
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:39,372

that it wouldn't have some effect.

<i>When it's time to return,</i>

because it puts you into a higher orbit,

305
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:10,891
so you have to reduce thrust and drop
into a lower orbit in order to catch up.

00:27:10,892 --> 00:27:14,560

they teach you as a pilot, but...

coming in too slow to reach the runway.

You know Deke had his doubts about him.
That's why he moved Elliot off Eight.

455
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:24,919
- Deke gave Elliot his own command.
- Elliot wasn't aggressive enough.

- You of all people have to know that.
- No, I don't.

I didn't investigate the crash.

01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:04,011
Neil, when you learned you were
going to command this flight,

1225
01:31:04,012 --> 01:31:06,887
<i>were you surprised? Overjoyed?</i>

<i>you'll go down in history.</i>

What kind of thoughts do you have about
that when the thought hits you, uh,

1232

1
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:25,238
I killed Sirius Black!

2
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:31,670
He's back.

3
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,394
The police are
continuing with the investigation...

4
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,607
...into the cause
of the Millennium Bridge disaster.

5
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:04,478
Traffic has been halted
as police search for survivors.

6
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:06,317
The surrounding area remains closed.

7
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:09,658
The mayor has urged Londoners
to remain calm...

8
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,246
"Harry Potter. "

9
00:03:16,668 --> 00:03:18,412
Who's Harry Potter?

10
00:03:19,963 --> 00:03:21,956
Oh, no one.

11
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:23,883
Bit of a tosser, really.

12
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:28,046
Funny, that paper of yours.

13
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:30,842
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

14
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:33,803
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

15
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:45,109
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

16
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:48,066
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

17
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,201
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

18
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:43,667
I like riding around on trains.

19
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:46,832
Takes my mind off things.

20
00:04:48,344 --> 00:04:50,253
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

21
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:53,762
The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.

22
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:56,470
But now is not the time to tell it.

23
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:58,221
Take my arm.

24
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:03,141
Do as I say.

25
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,736
I just Apparated, didn't I?

26
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,077
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

27
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,868
Most people vomit the first time.

28
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,785
I can't imagine why.

29
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:33,258
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

30
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,724
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're
wondering why I brought you here.

31
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:39,601
Am I right?

32
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:43,138
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

33
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:49,527
Wands out, Harry.

34
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:02,415
Horace?

35
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:15,965
Horace?

36
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:09,518
Merlin's beard!

37
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,982
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

38
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:16,854
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

39
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:22,196
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the
stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

40
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:25,032
Dragon's blood.

41
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:28,577
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, introductions.

42
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:32,751
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

43
00:07:32,924 --> 00:07:34,383
...Horace Slughorn.

44
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,045
Horace...

45
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,006
...well, you know who this is.

46
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:41,881
Harry Potter.

47
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:46,470
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

48
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:49,101
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?

49
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:51,729
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

50
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:55,644
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

51
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:57,149
Do you know what that's like?

52
00:07:57,323 --> 00:08:01,071
You can only say no so many times, so
I never stay anywhere more than a week.

53
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:03,574
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

54
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:08,621
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.

55
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:45,119
That was fun.

56
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:49,123
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.

57
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,129
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

58
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:58,800
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

59
00:09:07,184 --> 00:09:09,260
You're very like your father.

60
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:13,266
- Except for the eyes. You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.

61
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,141
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.

62
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:20,652
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.

63
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:23,396
One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.

64
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:25,614
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

65
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:29,997
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

66
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:31,956
Right at the front.

67
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,421
All mine. Each and every one.

68
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:45,671
Ex-students, I mean.

69
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,310
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of The Daily Prophet.

70
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:55,679
Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...

71
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:57,138
...on the news of the day.

72
00:09:58,026 --> 00:10:00,980
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

73
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:03,610
Free tickets whenever I want them.

74
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:06,782
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

75
00:10:08,495 --> 00:10:10,037
Ah, yes.

76
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:12,363
Regulus Black.

77
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,490
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

78
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:19,207
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

79
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,587
It's a shame. Talented boy.

80
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:27,049
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

81
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,129
Horace?

82
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,392
Do you mind if I take this?

83
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:39,604
- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

84
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:42,896
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.

85
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,360
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

86
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:48,486
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

87
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:51,661
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

88
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:53,997
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

89
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,322
Bye.

90
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:09,848
All right. I'll do it.

91
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:14,594
But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.

92
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,982
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

93
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:22,401
They are indeed.

94
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,696
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

95
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:32,945
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

96
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:36,537
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

97
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,080
You would be his crowning jewel.

98
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:44,792
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

99
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:48,628
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

100
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:53,845
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

101
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:57,468
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

102
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:01,310
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

103
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:04,483
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

104
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:07,321
Both are waiting for you.

105
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:42,355
Hedwig.

106
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:46,187
Mum?

107
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,945
Ginny, what is it?

108
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:51,605
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

109
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:55,032
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.

110
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:58,369
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

111
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:02,039
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

112
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:06,330
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

113
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:08,463
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

114
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:11,669
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?

115
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:14,336
- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?

116
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:16,258
He's wandering about the house.

117
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,176
- Really?
- Really.

118
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:20,012
Harry!

119
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:27,942
Harry!

120
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:33,148
What a lovely surprise.

121
00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:37,568
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

122
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:40,580
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.

123
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:42,990
But then, what would we do
without him?

124
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:46,921
Got a bit of toothpaste.

125
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,548
So when did you get here?

126
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:57,430
A few days ago.

127
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,675
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

128
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,767
Mum sort of lost it last week.

129
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:07,899
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

130
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:09,443
That it's too dangerous.

131
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:12,446
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.

132
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:15,947
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

133
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:19,984
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

134
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:22,695
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

135
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,955
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

136
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:31,832
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

137
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,299
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

138
00:14:34,468 --> 00:14:36,259
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

139
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:38,006
What is he?

140
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,383
Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.

141
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:05,284
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!

142
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:06,915
The Dark Lord trusts him.

143
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,666
- The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.

144
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,192
Run along, Wormtail.

145
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,701
I know I ought not to be here.

146
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,585
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

147
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:54,423
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

148
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:58,836
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

149
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:06,674
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

150
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:08,015
You?

151
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:11,393
The Dark Lord told you?

152
00:16:11,982 --> 00:16:14,520
Your sister doubts me.

153
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:18,404
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.

154
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:22,320
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

155
00:16:23,744 --> 00:16:27,658
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

156
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:29,740
I don't doubt you, Severus.

157
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:33,083
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

158
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:39,381
He's just a boy.

159
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,261
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

160
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:48,555
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

161
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:53,230
- Severus.
- Swear to it.

162
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:59,726
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

163
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:06,653
It's just empty words.

164
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:10,031
He'll give it his best effort.

165
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:12,579
But when it matters most...

166
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:18,422
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

167
00:17:21,884 --> 00:17:23,509
Coward.

168
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:30,138
Take out your wand.

169
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,486
Will you...

170
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,697
...Severus Snape...

171
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:49,785
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

172
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:54,782
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

173
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,828
I will.

174
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:02,878
And will you,
to the best of your ability...

175
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:05,757
...protect him from harm?

176
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:08,502
I will.

177
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,091
And if Draco should fail...

178
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:18,855
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

179
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:24,020
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?

180
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:30,779
I will.

181
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:56,561
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

182
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:57,761
Nosebleed Nougats!

183
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:01,023
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!

184
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,065
- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.

185
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:21,919
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.

186
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:24,210
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

187
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:26,125
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

188
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,585
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.

189
00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:33,095
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

190
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:34,428
Meaning?

191
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,722
Are you not
currently dating Dean Thomas?

192
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:38,930
It's none of your business.

193
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:45,725
How much for this?

194
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:47,279
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.

195
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:49,569
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.

196
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,938
I'm your brother.

197
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,365
- Ten Galleons.
- Ten Galleons.

198
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:56,948
Come on, let's go.

199
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,828
Hi, Ron.

200
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,145
How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

201
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:22,886
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

202
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,314
I reckon he's right.

203
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:28,688
Oh, no.

204
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:31,480
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.

205
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,336
Harry?

206
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:49,248
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...

207
00:20:49,424 --> 00:20:51,132
...who don't want to be followed?

208
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:37,694
Quibbler.

209
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:41,035
Quibbler.

210
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:47,617
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

211
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:50,165
- Quibbler?
- Oh, please.

212
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,918
- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.

213
00:22:54,091 --> 00:22:57,257
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

214
00:22:57,803 --> 00:22:59,345
Quibbler.

215
00:23:09,814 --> 00:23:12,566
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

216
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:14,442
And who were all those people?

217
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:17,730
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

218
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:19,815
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.

219
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:22,482
It's happened. He's one of them.

220
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,154
One of what?

221
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:28,364
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

222
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,498
You're barking.

223
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:32,791
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?

224
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:37,006
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

225
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:39,048
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

226
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:43,085
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

227
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:44,841
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

228
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:48,349
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

229
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,604
I need some air.

230
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:12,114
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

231
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:35,772
- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.

232
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:39,062
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

233
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:42,606
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

234
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:56,076
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

235
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:58,247
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...

236
00:24:58,423 --> 00:25:00,546
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

237
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:02,045
What's that supposed to mean?

238
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:07,134
Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.

239
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:10,760
Amused, Blaise?

240
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:14,635
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

241
00:25:36,794 --> 00:25:40,543
You two go on.
I wanna check something.

242
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:43,997
Where's Harry?

243
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:47,130
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

244
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,319
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

245
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,067
Petrificus Totalus.

246
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:24,456
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

247
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:33,138
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.

248
00:27:16,977 --> 00:27:18,720
Finite.

249
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,140
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!

250
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:31,238
- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

251
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,626
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

252
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:43,959
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.

253
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,169
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

254
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,381
That's nice.

255
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,753
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.

256
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:54,764
Right. Names?

257
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:57,387
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

258
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,682
No exceptions, Potter.

259
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:01,972
Who are those people?

260
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,435
Aurors. For security.

261
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:06,066
What's this cane here, then?

262
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,601
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

263
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:12,777
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?

264
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:17,035
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

265
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:22,447
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

266
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,798
Nice face, Potter.

267
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,675
Would you like me to fix it for you?

268
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:44,636
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

269
00:28:44,814 --> 00:28:46,356
...but it's up to you.

270
00:28:46,774 --> 00:28:49,063
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

271
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:52,936
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?

272
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,904
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

273
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:02,369
- Episkey.
- Ah!

274
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:11,671
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

275
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:14,176
Brilliant.

276
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,599
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

277
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:30,186
Will you stop eating?

278
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,601
Your best friend is missing!

279
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:36,028
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

280
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:40,321
He's covered in blood again.

281
00:29:40,954 --> 00:29:44,738
- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.

282
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,082
Where have you been?

283
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,707
- What happened to your face?
- Later.

284
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:51,504
What've I missed?

285
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:55,832
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

286
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,545
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?

287
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:09,104
Very best of evenings to you all.

288
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:10,304
Thanks.

289
00:30:12,526 --> 00:30:17,188
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

290
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:19,606
...Horace Slughorn.

291
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:25,370
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

292
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,834
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

293
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:32,920
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

294
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:34,880
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

295
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:36,758
Snape?

296
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,431
Now, as you know...

297
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,265
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

298
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:50,430
And you have the right to know why.

299
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:54,814
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...

300
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:57,441
...sat in this very hall...

301
00:30:57,821 --> 00:31:02,448
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

302
00:31:03,036 --> 00:31:07,413
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

303
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,124
His name?

304
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:11,913
Tom Riddle.

305
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:18,751
Today, of course...

306
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:22,635
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

307
00:31:23,806 --> 00:31:29,014
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

308
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,559
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

309
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:35,852
Every day, every hour...

310
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,984
...this very minute, perhaps...

311
00:31:38,154 --> 00:31:42,483
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

312
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:49,658
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

313
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,833
Just something to think about.

314
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:57,666
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

315
00:31:59,341 --> 00:32:01,133
That was cheerful.

316
00:32:06,432 --> 00:32:11,177
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

317
00:32:11,979 --> 00:32:16,973
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

318
00:32:19,778 --> 00:32:21,189
Potter.

319
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,488
Oh, this can't be good.

320
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:29,162
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

321
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,284
- I had a free period this morning.
- So I noticed.

322
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,200
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

323
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:39,047
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

324
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,458
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

325
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:46,506
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

326
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,258
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T. S students...

327
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:53,226
...with "Exceeds Expectations. "

328
00:32:53,728 --> 00:32:55,388
Brilliant. Um...

329
00:32:55,564 --> 00:32:58,019
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.

330
00:32:58,191 --> 00:33:03,102
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

331
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:06,186
I don't wanna take Potions.

332
00:33:06,366 --> 00:33:09,070
This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

333
00:33:10,328 --> 00:33:12,286
Attention to detail
in the preparation...

334
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,745
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

335
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:21,709
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.

336
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:23,539
Ron Weasley, sir.

337
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:26,548
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

338
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,796
- I'm gonna...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

339
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:32,056
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

340
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:34,763
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

341
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:36,644
Get what you want from the cupboard.

342
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:40,146
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

343
00:33:40,316 --> 00:33:44,266
Any ideas what these might be?

344
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:48,354
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

345
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,082
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

346
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,955
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

347
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,250
It's terribly tricky to make.

348
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:06,464
And this is Amortentia...

349
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:09,043
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

350
00:34:09,972 --> 00:34:13,804
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

351
00:34:15,102 --> 00:34:17,095
For example, I smell...

352
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:21,899
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

353
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:25,401
...spearmint toothpaste.

354
00:34:26,822 --> 00:34:30,273
Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

355
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:35,445
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

356
00:34:35,622 --> 00:34:42,289
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

357
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:50,629
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

358
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:52,720
Oh, yes.

359
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,462
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

360
00:34:55,641 --> 00:35:01,062
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

361
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,722
But it is more commonly referred to as...

362
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:09,190
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

363
00:35:09,697 --> 00:35:12,698
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

364
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:18,486
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

365
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:23,033
At least until the effects wear off.

366
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:27,710
So this is what I offer each of you today.

367
00:35:27,882 --> 00:35:32,710
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

368
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:37,465
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

369
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:40,892
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

370
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:44,726
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

371
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:48,232
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

372
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:51,061
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

373
00:35:51,947 --> 00:35:53,738
Let the brewing commence.

374
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:00,548
This book is the property of the half blood prince

375
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:25,044
cut the sopophorus bean

376
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:31,396
How did you do that?

377
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:34,105
You crush it. Don't cut it.

378
00:36:34,282 --> 00:36:36,773
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

379
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:38,778
No, really.

380
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:19,448
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

381
00:37:20,953 --> 00:37:24,156
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

382
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:29,416
So here we are, then, as promised.

383
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:32,790
One vial of Felix Felicis.

384
00:37:32,965 --> 00:37:35,004
Congratulations.

385
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:38,260
Use it well.

386
00:38:05,872 --> 00:38:08,541
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

387
00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:11,585
How are you?

388
00:38:11,753 --> 00:38:13,295
I'm fine, sir.

389
00:38:13,463 --> 00:38:14,708
Enjoying your classes?

390
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:19,002
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

391
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:22,009
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

392
00:38:22,723 --> 00:38:23,838
Do you?

393
00:38:24,392 --> 00:38:25,637
Definitely.

394
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:30,480
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

395
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,683
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...

396
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:36,480
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

397
00:38:36,654 --> 00:38:37,898
I can't help wondering...

398
00:38:38,072 --> 00:38:43,066
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

399
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:46,244
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

400
00:38:47,331 --> 00:38:49,204
But enough chitchat.

401
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:52,999
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

402
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:56,423
The answer lies here.

403
00:38:57,425 --> 00:38:59,583
What you are looking at are memories.

404
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,592
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

405
00:39:03,764 --> 00:39:06,220
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

406
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:13,101
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

407
00:39:13,273 --> 00:39:15,480
...of the day I first met him.

408
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:19,606
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

409
00:39:57,234 --> 00:40:01,481
I admit some confusion upon
receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.

410
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:01,516
Wool's orphan

411
00:40:01,822 --> 00:40:05,273
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

412
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,198
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.

413
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:13,781
Tom, you have a visitor.

414
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:15,994
How do you do, Tom?

415
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:24,754
Don't.

416
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,679
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.

417
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:37,894
I am a professor.

418
00:40:38,607 --> 00:40:40,435
I don't believe you.

419
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,603
She wants me looked at.

420
00:40:43,196 --> 00:40:45,402
They think I'm different.

421
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:47,067
Well, perhaps they're right.

422
00:40:47,242 --> 00:40:48,700
I'm not mad.

423
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:52,202
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

424
00:40:52,372 --> 00:40:54,364
Hogwarts is a school.

425
00:40:55,124 --> 00:40:56,287
A school of magic.

426
00:41:00,796 --> 00:41:03,549
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

427
00:41:04,676 --> 00:41:07,345
Things other children can't.

428
00:41:08,722 --> 00:41:11,676
I can make things move
without touching them.

429
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:16,183
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

430
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,514
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

431
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,108
I can make them hurt...

432
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:25,278
...if I want.

433
00:41:25,822 --> 00:41:27,695
Who are you?

434
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:30,072
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

435
00:41:31,244 --> 00:41:32,702
I'm different.

436
00:41:33,746 --> 00:41:35,157
Prove it.

437
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:46,588
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

438
00:41:56,311 --> 00:42:00,094
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

439
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:05,943
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

440
00:42:06,112 --> 00:42:07,274
You understand me?

441
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:13,780
I can speak to snakes too.

442
00:42:15,037 --> 00:42:16,828
They find me.

443
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:19,741
Whisper things.

444
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,120
Is that normal for someone like me?

445
00:42:44,191 --> 00:42:47,477
Did you know, sir? Then?

446
00:42:47,653 --> 00:42:53,276
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

447
00:42:53,867 --> 00:42:55,990
If I had, I...

448
00:42:57,622 --> 00:43:00,078
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

449
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,583
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

450
00:43:03,753 --> 00:43:05,580
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

451
00:43:08,508 --> 00:43:11,959
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?

452
00:43:12,136 --> 00:43:14,176
No, I did not.

453
00:43:14,347 --> 00:43:18,179
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

454
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:21,058
And he will not give it up easily.

455
00:43:21,228 --> 00:43:24,431
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

456
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:25,852
I did.

457
00:43:26,567 --> 00:43:28,559
Do you want me to let him?

458
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:31,320
Yes.

459
00:44:55,488 --> 00:44:57,196
All right. Um...

460
00:44:57,365 --> 00:45:00,450
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

461
00:45:00,618 --> 00:45:02,741
...just to assess your strengths.

462
00:45:03,455 --> 00:45:05,447
Quiet! Please!

463
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:06,786
Shut it!

464
00:45:10,628 --> 00:45:13,380
Thanks. All right. Um...

465
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:15,672
Just because you
made the team last year...

466
00:45:15,843 --> 00:45:18,796
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?

467
00:45:21,307 --> 00:45:22,588
Good.

468
00:45:31,317 --> 00:45:33,523
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

469
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,268
Hard feelings?

470
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:38,981
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.

471
00:45:39,158 --> 00:45:41,827
Really? Strapping guy like you?

472
00:45:41,994 --> 00:45:44,567
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

473
00:45:44,747 --> 00:45:47,154
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

474
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:50,333
Oh, I like my chances.

475
00:45:50,502 --> 00:45:54,286
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?

476
00:45:54,464 --> 00:45:58,628
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?

477
00:46:10,939 --> 00:46:12,647
Come on, Weasley!

478
00:46:12,816 --> 00:46:14,523
- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!

479
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:18,939
- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!

480
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:20,358
Go on, Cormac!

481
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:38,957
Come on, Ron!

482
00:46:49,644 --> 00:46:51,518
Come on, Ron.

483
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:10,576
Confundus.

484
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,006
Isn't he brilliant?

485
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:35,269
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

486
00:47:35,607 --> 00:47:38,394
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

487
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:41,855
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

488
00:47:42,948 --> 00:47:44,940
He's vile.

489
00:47:49,913 --> 00:47:52,155
Have you ever heard of this spell?
Sectumsempra?

490
00:47:52,332 --> 00:47:54,408
No, I haven't.

491
00:47:54,584 --> 00:47:57,704
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

492
00:47:57,879 --> 00:48:00,334
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

493
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:04,670
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

494
00:48:05,803 --> 00:48:07,084
What?

495
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,636
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.

496
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:12,303
No.

497
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:15,092
Why not?

498
00:48:15,647 --> 00:48:17,272
The binding is fragile.

499
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,062
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.

500
00:48:24,322 --> 00:48:25,900
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

501
00:48:26,074 --> 00:48:29,822
That's what it says right here: "This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince. "

502
00:48:47,178 --> 00:48:50,511
For weeks you carry around
this book, practically sleep with it...

503
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,970
...yet you have no desire to find out
who he is?

504
00:48:53,142 --> 00:48:56,558
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

505
00:48:56,729 --> 00:48:57,760
Well, it's true.

506
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:01,687
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

507
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:03,851
It's just like being with Hermione.

508
00:49:05,153 --> 00:49:07,644
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

509
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:10,361
- The library.
- The library. And?

510
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:12,909
And nothing.

511
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:16,114
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

512
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,365
- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!

513
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:20,867
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

514
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:25,706
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

515
00:49:29,218 --> 00:49:31,626
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

516
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:34,213
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

517
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:38,009
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

518
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:40,642
No, not there. Over here.

519
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:42,815
No, sit beside me.

520
00:49:44,568 --> 00:49:45,848
Okay.

521
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,696
Something to drink?

522
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:51,401
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

523
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,127
Oh, bloody hell.

524
00:50:08,092 --> 00:50:09,918
Slick git.

525
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,930
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

526
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:17,011
And snogging.

527
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:20,639
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

528
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:22,391
You can't be serious.

529
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:24,937
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?

530
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:29,023
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?

531
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:32,778
- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

532
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,943
And you, and you.

533
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,910
So, what brings you here?

534
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:41,788
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

535
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:45,410
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

536
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:48,921
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...

537
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:52,506
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

538
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:54,884
...for the select student or two.

539
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:58,922
- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.

540
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:02,559
You would be welcome too, Granger.

541
00:51:03,355 --> 00:51:08,101
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.

542
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:10,943
Good to see you, Wallenby.

543
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:17,576
What are you playing at?

544
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:21,696
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

545
00:51:21,873 --> 00:51:23,831
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.

546
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:27,749
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

547
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,466
Got a little bit...

548
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:48,229
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

549
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:49,858
- Harry.
- What?

550
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:53,525
Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?

551
00:51:54,322 --> 00:51:56,065
As if.

552
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:05,830
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

553
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:30,066
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

554
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:47,406
Do not touch that, except by
the wrappings. Do you understand?

555
00:53:00,888 --> 00:53:03,462
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

556
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:06,132
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

557
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:08,311
It's like I said.

558
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:13,433
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.

559
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:17,399
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

560
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:21,739
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

561
00:53:22,076 --> 00:53:24,746
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

562
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:34,963
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?

563
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:40,461
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

564
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:42,589
McGONAGALL:
Oh, Severus.

565
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,184
What do you think?

566
00:53:52,106 --> 00:53:56,899
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

567
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,311
She was cursed, wasn't she?

568
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:02,158
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

569
00:54:02,658 --> 00:54:06,241
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

570
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:08,321
Yes, she was cursed.

571
00:54:09,123 --> 00:54:10,783
It was Malfoy.

572
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:16,494
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

573
00:54:16,672 --> 00:54:18,166
Indeed.

574
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:22,424
- Your evidence?
- I just know.

575
00:54:23,178 --> 00:54:25,171
You just...

576
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:27,802
...know.

577
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:32,763
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

578
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:36,889
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

579
00:54:37,068 --> 00:54:43,188
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

580
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:51,369
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

581
00:55:01,884 --> 00:55:04,801
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?

582
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:08,506
Well, what does she see in him?

583
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:10,888
Dean? He's brilliant.

584
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:13,894
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

585
00:55:14,062 --> 00:55:17,846
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?

586
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:22,568
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.

587
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:24,733
I suppose.

588
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:29,158
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.

589
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:32,319
She's smart, funny.

590
00:55:33,082 --> 00:55:35,370
- Attractive.
- Attractive?

591
00:55:36,919 --> 00:55:40,418
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?

592
00:55:41,256 --> 00:55:43,083
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?

593
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:47,754
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

594
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:52,884
Hermione's got nice skin.

595
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:56,353
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

596
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:59,389
I've never really thought about it.

597
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:02,651
But, I suppose, yeah.

598
00:56:03,404 --> 00:56:04,862
Very nice.

599
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:12,653
- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.

600
00:56:22,506 --> 00:56:26,455
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

601
00:56:26,635 --> 00:56:29,126
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

602
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,510
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

603
00:56:31,681 --> 00:56:34,635
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

604
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:36,802
What about your uncle, Belby?

605
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:40,429
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

606
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:43,394
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.

607
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:47,650
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

608
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:51,109
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

609
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:56,410
What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?

610
00:56:57,166 --> 00:56:58,993
My parents are dentists.

611
00:57:03,547 --> 00:57:04,828
They tend to people's teeth.

612
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:09,752
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

613
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:11,209
No.

614
00:57:13,182 --> 00:57:17,678
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

615
00:57:17,853 --> 00:57:19,098
He needed 10 stitches.

616
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,978
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

617
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:36,112
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

618
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:38,992
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

619
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:47,206
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

620
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,218
What?

621
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,015
Nothing.

622
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:07,974
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

623
00:58:12,866 --> 00:58:14,609
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.

624
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:17,357
I was just admiring your hourglass.

625
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:20,205
Oh, yes.

626
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:22,788
A most intriguing object.

627
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:27,706
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

628
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:31,255
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

629
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,668
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.

630
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,178
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

631
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:39,589
As to some of your classmates...

632
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:43,183
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

633
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:44,848
The shelf, sir?

634
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:49,057
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

635
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:53,103
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?

636
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:56,614
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

637
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:02,700
You knew him, didn't you, sir,
Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

638
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:07,291
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

639
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:09,040
What was he like?

640
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:15,131
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

641
00:59:15,804 --> 00:59:17,630
He killed my parents.

642
00:59:20,392 --> 00:59:21,672
Of course.

643
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,061
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

644
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:29,983
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

645
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:33,143
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

646
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:37,569
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

647
00:59:37,743 --> 00:59:39,486
Not unlike others I've known.

648
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:42,154
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

649
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:45,574
If the monster existed...

650
00:59:46,126 --> 00:59:48,368
...it was buried deep within.

651
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,181
Good luck, eh, Ron.

652
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:11,061
- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.

653
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:14,318
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

654
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:16,812
- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!

655
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,527
What's he wearing?

656
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:30,994
So how was it, then?

657
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,537
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?

658
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,339
Pretty boring, actually.

659
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,459
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

660
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,641
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

661
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,351
And we're meant to bring someone.

662
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,219
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

663
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:54,233
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?

664
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,062
Good luck today, Ron.

665
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,232
I know you'll be brilliant.

666
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:09,035
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

667
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,702
Have it your way.

668
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,367
- Juice?
- Sure.

669
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,253
Hello, everyone.

670
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,582
You look dreadful, Ron.

671
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,130
Is that why you put something
in his cup?

672
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:24,972
Is it a tonic?

673
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,060
Liquid luck.

674
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:33,098
Don't drink it, Ron.

675
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,066
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

676
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:48,908
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

677
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,900
Go on, Ron! Do it!

678
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:54,140
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

679
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:59,599
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

680
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:14,952
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!

681
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,920
You really shouldn't have done it.

682
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:26,083
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.

683
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:31,721
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.

684
01:03:34,518 --> 01:03:36,226
You didn't put it in.

685
01:03:37,938 --> 01:03:39,765
Ron only thought you did.

686
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,857
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

687
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,615
Well, they're really good.

688
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,121
How does it feel, Harry?

689
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,170
When you see Dean with Ginny?

690
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,725
I know.

691
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,969
I see the way you look at her.

692
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,313
You're my best friend.

693
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,234
Oops.

694
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,902
I think this room's taken.

695
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,076
What's with the birds?

696
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:25,169
Oppugno.

697
01:05:53,198 --> 01:05:54,906
It feels like this.

698
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:37,651
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

699
01:06:37,826 --> 01:06:42,903
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.

700
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:44,493
It's chemical.

701
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:48,996
Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.

702
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:52,006
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.

703
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,582
I really couldn't care less.

704
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,592
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

705
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,258
Yes.

706
01:07:00,432 --> 01:07:04,845
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

707
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,218
Have you?

708
01:07:06,396 --> 01:07:08,389
Yes. Why?

709
01:07:08,565 --> 01:07:12,183
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

710
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,602
...we should go together, as friends.

711
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,404
Why didn't I think of that?

712
01:07:16,573 --> 01:07:18,115
Who are you going with?

713
01:07:18,283 --> 01:07:20,074
Um, it's a surprise.

714
01:07:20,243 --> 01:07:24,455
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry
about. You can't just take anyone.

715
01:07:25,081 --> 01:07:26,956
See that girl over there?

716
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:33,294
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.

717
01:07:33,465 --> 01:07:34,959
Really?

718
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:39,377
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

719
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,262
But I am the Chosen One.

720
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:44,302
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

721
01:07:46,311 --> 01:07:47,770
I'll ask someone I like.

722
01:07:48,563 --> 01:07:50,105
Someone cool.

723
01:07:59,866 --> 01:08:02,902
I've never been to this part of the castle.

724
01:08:03,077 --> 01:08:06,327
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

725
01:08:06,497 --> 01:08:08,988
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

726
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,200
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
£¨detailed explanation£¬see http:/harrypotter. wikia. com/wiki/Harmonia_Nectare_Passus£©

727
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,465
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

728
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,679
Harmonia Nectere Passus.

729
01:09:17,318 --> 01:09:18,729
Drink?

730
01:09:19,654 --> 01:09:20,982
Neville.

731
01:09:21,155 --> 01:09:22,614
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

732
01:09:22,782 --> 01:09:25,901
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

733
01:09:26,077 --> 01:09:28,864
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

734
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:42,253
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?

735
01:09:42,427 --> 01:09:47,717
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

736
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:50,927
Cormac? That's who you invited?

737
01:09:51,102 --> 01:09:53,593
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

738
01:09:54,438 --> 01:09:56,431
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

739
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:59,608
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

740
01:09:59,777 --> 01:10:01,935
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

741
01:10:02,113 --> 01:10:04,782
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

742
01:10:04,949 --> 01:10:06,775
On second thoughts...

743
01:10:06,951 --> 01:10:08,943
Might keep Cormac at bay.

744
01:10:09,286 --> 01:10:12,204
Oh, God, here he comes.

745
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:17,620
I think she just went to powder her nose.

746
01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:19,871
Slippery little minx, your friend.

747
01:10:20,048 --> 01:10:22,752
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?

748
01:10:25,803 --> 01:10:27,796
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

749
01:10:28,973 --> 01:10:30,597
Dragon balls.

750
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,939
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

751
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:48,982
Not so quick, Potter.

752
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,656
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...

753
01:10:53,831 --> 01:10:57,746
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

754
01:10:57,919 --> 01:11:00,160
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

755
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,039
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

756
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:06,882
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

757
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:08,596
You see...

758
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:14,303
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

759
01:11:14,477 --> 01:11:16,020
Traveling where?

760
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:26,027
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

761
01:11:27,156 --> 01:11:28,864
Professor Slughorn, sir.

762
01:11:29,033 --> 01:11:33,362
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

763
01:11:33,538 --> 01:11:35,577
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

764
01:11:35,748 --> 01:11:39,034
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

765
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:43,042
I'll escort him out.

766
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:49,506
Certainly, professor.

767
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:56,390
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

768
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:03,390
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

769
01:12:03,567 --> 01:12:05,643
I swore to protect you.

770
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:09,152
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

771
01:12:09,322 --> 01:12:11,481
I don't need protection.

772
01:12:11,658 --> 01:12:15,821
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.

773
01:12:16,746 --> 01:12:20,281
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

774
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:24,789
You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

775
01:12:24,963 --> 01:12:26,422
No!

776
01:12:26,757 --> 01:12:30,173
I was chosen. This is my moment.

777
01:12:42,606 --> 01:12:44,183
"Unbreakable Vow. "

778
01:12:44,357 --> 01:12:45,982
You're sure that's what Snape said?

779
01:12:46,151 --> 01:12:48,439
Positive. Why?

780
01:12:48,611 --> 01:12:52,111
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

781
01:12:52,282 --> 01:12:55,616
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

782
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,863
You don't understand.

783
01:12:58,497 --> 01:12:59,528
Oh, bloody hell.

784
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:29,317
I miss you.

785
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:32,572
Lovely.

786
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:36,025
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

787
01:13:36,201 --> 01:13:38,408
I'll take your word for it.

788
01:13:48,505 --> 01:13:53,464
So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

789
01:13:54,011 --> 01:13:55,719
You die.

790
01:14:00,309 --> 01:14:02,183
Wait, the pudding's still here.

791
01:14:03,437 --> 01:14:06,771
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

792
01:14:06,941 --> 01:14:08,020
I know it sounds mad.

793
01:14:08,192 --> 01:14:11,691
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

794
01:14:11,862 --> 01:14:14,353
...so he could find out
what he was up to?

795
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:17,532
- That's not what it sounded like.
- Perhaps Harry's right.

796
01:14:18,076 --> 01:14:19,701
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

797
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:23,369
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

798
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:27,620
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.

799
01:14:27,794 --> 01:14:28,957
You're blinded by hatred.

800
01:14:29,129 --> 01:14:31,168
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

801
01:14:32,924 --> 01:14:35,925
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

802
01:14:36,094 --> 01:14:38,051
We place our trust
in a handful of people.

803
01:14:38,221 --> 01:14:41,175
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

804
01:15:05,664 --> 01:15:07,206
Open up, you.

805
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:10,500
Don't you trust me?

806
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:17,839
It's good.

807
01:15:18,762 --> 01:15:21,597
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

808
01:15:28,355 --> 01:15:31,142
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.

809
01:15:43,077 --> 01:15:44,620
You'll have to forgive Remus.

810
01:15:44,871 --> 01:15:47,706
It takes its toll, his condition.

811
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:50,664
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

812
01:15:50,835 --> 01:15:53,373
We're being followed, all of us.

813
01:15:53,546 --> 01:15:56,037
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

814
01:15:56,883 --> 01:15:58,959
It's not been easy.

815
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:02,382
Did you get my owl?

816
01:16:02,556 --> 01:16:04,632
Yes, I did.

817
01:16:06,143 --> 01:16:09,179
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

818
01:16:09,354 --> 01:16:11,809
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

819
01:16:12,524 --> 01:16:15,015
As for Draco Malfoy...

820
01:16:15,652 --> 01:16:16,814
...I know a bit more.

821
01:16:17,445 --> 01:16:20,481
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

822
01:16:20,657 --> 01:16:22,982
I think, from what you described...

823
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:24,819
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

824
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:28,493
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

825
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:30,159
...is a vanishing cabinet.

826
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:32,322
A vanishing cabinet?

827
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:36,499
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

828
01:16:36,672 --> 01:16:39,626
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

829
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:44,546
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

830
01:16:45,181 --> 01:16:46,925
They can transport you anywhere.

831
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,469
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

832
01:16:50,645 --> 01:16:53,562
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?

833
01:16:53,731 --> 01:16:54,846
Nothing.

834
01:16:55,692 --> 01:16:57,400
It's still there.

835
01:17:08,496 --> 01:17:10,204
It was delicious, Molly, really.

836
01:17:10,373 --> 01:17:11,701
Are you sure you won't stay?

837
01:17:11,874 --> 01:17:16,251
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.

838
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,451
Remus?

839
01:17:26,388 --> 01:17:27,930
Sweetheart.

840
01:17:36,232 --> 01:17:37,975
Has Ron gone to bed?

841
01:17:38,150 --> 01:17:40,986
Um... Not yet. No.

842
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:44,108
Shoelace.

843
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,584
Merry Christmas, Harry.

844
01:18:00,005 --> 01:18:01,547
Merry Christmas.

845
01:18:18,816 --> 01:18:21,105
- Harry, no!
- Remus!

846
01:18:30,953 --> 01:18:32,363
Ginny!

847
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:40,202
I killed Sirius Black!
I killed Sirius Black!

848
01:18:40,379 --> 01:18:42,620
You coming to get me?

849
01:18:43,715 --> 01:18:47,049
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

850
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:18,165
Harry?

851
01:19:35,684 --> 01:19:37,344
Stupefy!

852
01:20:00,209 --> 01:20:01,952
Harry!

853
01:20:15,474 --> 01:20:16,672
Ginny!

854
01:20:46,254 --> 01:20:47,748
Molly.

855
01:21:10,737 --> 01:21:12,445
It's easy for them to get to you.

856
01:21:12,614 --> 01:21:16,742
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

857
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:19,447
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

858
01:21:20,413 --> 01:21:21,611
Sorry.

859
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:26,624
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

860
01:21:26,794 --> 01:21:28,952
That's my Won-Won.

861
01:21:30,965 --> 01:21:33,372
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

862
01:21:51,027 --> 01:21:53,316
I'd like to know
where you get your information.

863
01:21:53,488 --> 01:21:56,524
More knowledgeable
than half the staff, you are.

864
01:22:02,163 --> 01:22:03,705
Sir...

865
01:22:04,165 --> 01:22:07,001
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

866
01:22:07,169 --> 01:22:09,956
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

867
01:22:10,213 --> 01:22:14,377
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

868
01:22:14,968 --> 01:22:17,256
But how did you know?

869
01:22:19,097 --> 01:22:20,674
Intuition.

870
01:22:24,852 --> 01:22:26,561
Gracious. Is it that time already?

871
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:30,395
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

872
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:38,361
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

873
01:22:40,285 --> 01:22:42,361
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

874
01:22:43,705 --> 01:22:46,540
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

875
01:22:47,459 --> 01:22:52,453
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

876
01:22:52,839 --> 01:22:55,875
They might misunderstand.

877
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,628
Go on.

878
01:22:58,428 --> 01:23:00,716
I was in the library the other night...

879
01:23:01,264 --> 01:23:03,470
...in the Restricted Section...

880
01:23:04,225 --> 01:23:07,760
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

881
01:23:08,688 --> 01:23:12,187
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

882
01:23:12,358 --> 01:23:15,145
It's called, as I understand it...

883
01:23:18,072 --> 01:23:19,234
I beg your pardon?

884
01:23:19,406 --> 01:23:22,989
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

885
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:27,952
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

886
01:23:30,917 --> 01:23:32,080
Confused?

887
01:23:32,753 --> 01:23:34,247
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

888
01:23:35,172 --> 01:23:37,923
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

889
01:23:38,091 --> 01:23:41,756
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

890
01:23:42,095 --> 01:23:43,838
It is also a lie.

891
01:23:44,764 --> 01:23:46,556
This memory has been tampered with...

892
01:23:46,724 --> 01:23:51,102
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

893
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,723
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

894
01:23:53,899 --> 01:23:56,770
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

895
01:23:56,944 --> 01:23:58,438
Why, indeed?

896
01:23:59,238 --> 01:24:02,607
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

897
01:24:02,783 --> 01:24:06,401
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

898
01:24:06,578 --> 01:24:08,120
...any way you can.

899
01:24:08,288 --> 01:24:10,245
I don't know him that well, sir.

900
01:24:14,711 --> 01:24:17,628
This memory is everything.

901
01:24:18,131 --> 01:24:20,124
Without it, we are blind.

902
01:24:20,633 --> 01:24:24,252
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

903
01:24:26,307 --> 01:24:28,133
You have no choice.

904
01:24:29,351 --> 01:24:31,344
You must not fail.

905
01:24:39,445 --> 01:24:41,770
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

906
01:24:41,948 --> 01:24:43,406
...with the chapter on antidotes.

907
01:24:43,574 --> 01:24:47,323
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

908
01:24:47,495 --> 01:24:49,986
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

909
01:24:55,461 --> 01:24:59,245
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

910
01:24:59,423 --> 01:25:01,332
To what do I owe this pleasure?

911
01:25:02,509 --> 01:25:04,585
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

912
01:25:04,762 --> 01:25:07,003
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

913
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:10,181
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

914
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:14,015
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

915
01:25:15,355 --> 01:25:18,025
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

916
01:25:18,192 --> 01:25:21,526
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

917
01:25:21,696 --> 01:25:26,025
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

918
01:25:28,035 --> 01:25:29,364
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

919
01:25:29,537 --> 01:25:32,372
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

920
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:34,449
Yes. Um...

921
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:37,116
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

922
01:25:37,294 --> 01:25:39,085
What I mean to say is...

923
01:25:39,922 --> 01:25:41,713
...well, he's not like you.

924
01:25:42,382 --> 01:25:44,209
He might misunderstand.

925
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:49,342
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

926
01:25:49,514 --> 01:25:53,559
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

927
01:25:54,186 --> 01:25:55,845
I suggest you do the same.

928
01:25:56,229 --> 01:25:59,230
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?

929
01:26:06,197 --> 01:26:09,233
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

930
01:26:11,244 --> 01:26:12,868
Didn't he?

931
01:26:20,252 --> 01:26:21,533
Yes?

932
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:24,044
Oh, it's you, Potter.

933
01:26:24,215 --> 01:26:26,587
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

934
01:26:39,396 --> 01:26:43,182
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

935
01:26:44,194 --> 01:26:45,605
Divine.

936
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,568
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

937
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:53,282
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

938
01:26:53,453 --> 01:26:56,953
- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

939
01:26:57,124 --> 01:26:59,116
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

940
01:26:59,292 --> 01:27:01,618
She could never annoy me.

941
01:27:03,421 --> 01:27:04,963
I think I love her.

942
01:27:08,551 --> 01:27:10,840
Well, brilliant.

943
01:27:14,682 --> 01:27:16,307
Do you think she knows I exist?

944
01:27:16,476 --> 01:27:18,967
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

945
01:27:19,145 --> 01:27:22,099
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

946
01:27:23,024 --> 01:27:24,269
Who are you talking about?

947
01:27:25,026 --> 01:27:28,645
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

948
01:27:28,822 --> 01:27:30,316
Okay, very funny.

949
01:27:33,452 --> 01:27:37,117
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

950
01:27:37,289 --> 01:27:40,159
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

951
01:27:41,126 --> 01:27:44,080
No. Can you introduce me?

952
01:28:05,775 --> 01:28:10,521
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

953
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:24,991
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

954
01:28:25,837 --> 01:28:27,247
Where's Romilda?

955
01:28:27,422 --> 01:28:29,379
What's the matter with Wenby?

956
01:28:29,882 --> 01:28:31,709
Very powerful love potion.

957
01:28:31,884 --> 01:28:34,256
Very well. Better bring him in.

958
01:28:34,428 --> 01:28:37,714
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

959
01:28:37,890 --> 01:28:40,807
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

960
01:28:40,976 --> 01:28:44,061
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

961
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,889
Perhaps you're right.

962
01:28:50,402 --> 01:28:55,823
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

963
01:28:55,991 --> 01:29:00,369
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?

964
01:29:00,538 --> 01:29:03,455
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

965
01:29:03,624 --> 01:29:06,198
All the questions about Voldemort.

966
01:29:06,377 --> 01:29:08,204
Don't use that name.

967
01:29:15,928 --> 01:29:18,004
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

968
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:21,300
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

969
01:29:35,823 --> 01:29:38,112
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.

970
01:29:38,284 --> 01:29:40,407
A bloody strong one at that.

971
01:29:40,995 --> 01:29:44,613
- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up.

972
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:48,455
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

973
01:29:48,627 --> 01:29:52,957
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

974
01:29:55,259 --> 01:29:56,967
Here we are, Potter.

975
01:29:57,136 --> 01:29:58,630
To life!

976
01:30:03,433 --> 01:30:04,465
Ron.

977
01:30:06,937 --> 01:30:10,388
Ron. Professor, do something.

978
01:30:11,483 --> 01:30:13,107
I don't understand.

979
01:30:29,501 --> 01:30:31,293
Come on, Ron, breathe.

980
01:30:53,525 --> 01:30:56,360
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

981
01:31:07,372 --> 01:31:10,741
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

982
01:31:10,918 --> 01:31:13,290
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

983
01:31:13,462 --> 01:31:16,877
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

984
01:31:17,048 --> 01:31:19,801
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

985
01:31:19,969 --> 01:31:23,967
The question is,
why were they necessary?

986
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:25,883
Why, indeed?

987
01:31:26,058 --> 01:31:28,051
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

988
01:31:28,394 --> 01:31:31,229
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

989
01:31:31,397 --> 01:31:35,346
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

990
01:31:35,526 --> 01:31:37,981
...when not polluted with poison.

991
01:31:38,153 --> 01:31:41,273
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

992
01:31:41,448 --> 01:31:42,823
To whom, I might ask?

993
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:46,818
To you, Headmaster.

994
01:31:49,164 --> 01:31:50,243
Where is he?

995
01:31:50,415 --> 01:31:54,543
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

996
01:31:57,589 --> 01:31:59,249
What's she doing here?

997
01:31:59,424 --> 01:32:01,666
I might ask you the same question.

998
01:32:01,843 --> 01:32:04,085
I happen to be his girlfriend.

999
01:32:04,262 --> 01:32:07,014
I happen to be his friend.

1000
01:32:07,181 --> 01:32:11,393
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

1001
01:32:12,186 --> 01:32:15,057
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

1002
01:32:15,231 --> 01:32:18,931
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1003
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:21,945
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1004
01:32:23,614 --> 01:32:28,656
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1005
01:32:28,828 --> 01:32:32,114
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1006
01:32:32,791 --> 01:32:34,617
I'm here.

1007
01:32:40,465 --> 01:32:43,668
Uh... Hermione...

1008
01:32:47,722 --> 01:32:49,714
Hermione.

1009
01:32:50,474 --> 01:32:52,716
Hermione.

1010
01:33:00,317 --> 01:33:04,232
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

1011
01:33:04,572 --> 01:33:06,897
Well, come away, everybody.

1012
01:33:07,074 --> 01:33:09,696
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1013
01:33:13,957 --> 01:33:16,494
About time, don't you think?

1014
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,748
Thank you.

1015
01:33:23,674 --> 01:33:25,501
Oh, shut up.

1016
01:35:37,808 --> 01:35:41,591
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1017
01:35:46,066 --> 01:35:48,735
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1018
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:52,404
Um, well...

1019
01:35:52,572 --> 01:35:55,574
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1020
01:35:56,452 --> 01:35:58,859
And you talked.

1021
01:36:00,457 --> 01:36:04,537
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1022
01:36:04,711 --> 01:36:07,996
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

1023
01:36:08,172 --> 01:36:10,498
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1024
01:36:17,014 --> 01:36:20,513
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1025
01:36:22,144 --> 01:36:27,186
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

1026
01:36:27,358 --> 01:36:30,358
Anything at all?

1027
01:36:30,527 --> 01:36:32,354
There is something.

1028
01:36:35,866 --> 01:36:40,326
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1029
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:45,034
Right. Boggled.

1030
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,544
Harry.

1031
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:56,173
That's Katie.

1032
01:36:58,139 --> 01:36:59,763
Katie Bell.

1033
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:09,811
Katie. How are you?

1034
01:37:10,484 --> 01:37:14,980
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

1035
01:37:16,615 --> 01:37:20,149
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1036
01:37:20,577 --> 01:37:23,993
But I just can't.

1037
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:38,588
Katie?

1038
01:38:21,054 --> 01:38:25,134
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?

1039
01:38:55,505 --> 01:38:57,498
Sectumsempra!

1040
01:39:44,471 --> 01:39:47,388
Vulnera Sanentur.

1041
01:39:49,058 --> 01:39:51,893
Vulnera Sanentur.

1042
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:57,059
Vulnera Sanentur.

1043
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:21,705
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1044
01:40:26,595 --> 01:40:28,219
Take my hand.

1045
01:40:44,196 --> 01:40:46,105
The Room of Requirement.

1046
01:40:52,579 --> 01:40:55,201
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1047
01:40:55,374 --> 01:40:59,075
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

1048
01:41:07,428 --> 01:41:08,887
- What was that?
- What was that?

1049
01:41:34,997 --> 01:41:36,325
See?

1050
01:41:36,873 --> 01:41:38,913
You never know what you'll find up here.

1051
01:41:58,062 --> 01:42:01,976
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1052
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:07,527
Close your eyes.

1053
01:42:34,223 --> 01:42:37,093
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

1054
01:42:51,741 --> 01:42:54,113
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1055
01:42:54,285 --> 01:42:55,447
What?

1056
01:42:55,619 --> 01:42:57,695
You know, hide the book?

1057
01:42:57,872 --> 01:42:59,745
Oh, yeah.

1058
01:43:02,668 --> 01:43:05,241
Ah. Dear, yes.

1059
01:43:05,421 --> 01:43:08,208
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

1060
01:43:10,259 --> 01:43:11,587
Luck.

1061
01:43:12,636 --> 01:43:15,969
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1062
01:43:34,115 --> 01:43:37,318
Well, how do you feel?

1063
01:43:37,493 --> 01:43:39,118
Excellent.

1064
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:42,280
Really excellent.

1065
01:43:45,042 --> 01:43:46,620
Remember...

1066
01:43:46,961 --> 01:43:48,704
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1067
01:43:48,879 --> 01:43:51,881
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

1068
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:53,544
Right.

1069
01:43:53,969 --> 01:43:56,127
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

1070
01:43:56,304 --> 01:43:58,974
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

1071
01:44:00,558 --> 01:44:03,132
- We have a plan.
- I know...

1072
01:44:03,311 --> 01:44:05,387
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1073
01:44:05,563 --> 01:44:09,312
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

1074
01:44:10,193 --> 01:44:12,435
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1075
01:44:12,612 --> 01:44:14,770
Or Felix does.

1076
01:44:48,022 --> 01:44:49,730
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1077
01:44:49,899 --> 01:44:54,027
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

1078
01:44:54,195 --> 01:44:56,152
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

1079
01:44:56,322 --> 01:44:59,738
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

1080
01:44:59,909 --> 01:45:01,985
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1081
01:45:02,161 --> 01:45:04,948
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

1082
01:45:05,122 --> 01:45:08,706
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

1083
01:45:08,877 --> 01:45:11,202
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1084
01:45:11,379 --> 01:45:14,878
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1085
01:45:15,049 --> 01:45:18,834
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

1086
01:45:19,013 --> 01:45:22,298
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

1087
01:45:25,561 --> 01:45:27,719
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

1088
01:45:27,896 --> 01:45:29,390
Through the front door, sir.

1089
01:45:29,564 --> 01:45:31,723
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

1090
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:33,608
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1091
01:45:33,777 --> 01:45:36,066
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

1092
01:45:36,863 --> 01:45:38,488
Harry!

1093
01:45:39,324 --> 01:45:41,779
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

1094
01:45:41,951 --> 01:45:45,403
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1095
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:48,153
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1096
01:45:53,504 --> 01:45:56,707
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

1097
01:45:56,883 --> 01:45:58,626
...back to the castle immediately!

1098
01:45:58,801 --> 01:46:02,051
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1099
01:46:03,389 --> 01:46:05,512
And what makes you say that?

1100
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:08,178
No idea.

1101
01:46:14,942 --> 01:46:16,353
Horace.

1102
01:46:16,985 --> 01:46:22,276
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1103
01:46:22,866 --> 01:46:24,942
A dead one, I think, sir.

1104
01:46:25,744 --> 01:46:27,286
Good God.

1105
01:46:27,913 --> 01:46:30,997
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

1106
01:46:31,291 --> 01:46:34,742
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1107
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:39,131
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1108
01:46:39,632 --> 01:46:43,085
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1109
01:46:43,262 --> 01:46:45,468
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

1110
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:47,847
Not to mention the pincers.

1111
01:46:52,146 --> 01:46:54,103
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1112
01:46:54,815 --> 01:46:58,184
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

1113
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:02,440
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

1114
01:47:02,614 --> 01:47:04,820
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

1115
01:47:04,991 --> 01:47:07,613
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1116
01:47:07,786 --> 01:47:10,703
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

1117
01:47:10,872 --> 01:47:12,070
My thoughts exactly.

1118
01:47:12,248 --> 01:47:18,750
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1119
01:47:19,005 --> 01:47:23,999
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1120
01:47:24,679 --> 01:47:27,135
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1121
01:47:27,307 --> 01:47:30,972
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1122
01:47:32,395 --> 01:47:33,973
Oh, dear.

1123
01:47:43,698 --> 01:47:46,901
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

1124
01:47:47,159 --> 01:47:48,701
He had a family, I trust?

1125
01:47:48,869 --> 01:47:50,363
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:47:55,709 --> 01:47:57,203
Farewell...

1127
01:47:57,378 --> 01:47:59,251
Aragog.

1128
01:48:03,759 --> 01:48:06,676
Farewell, Aragog...

1129
01:48:07,054 --> 01:48:09,724
...king of the arachnids.

1130
01:48:10,558 --> 01:48:13,131
Your body will decay...

1131
01:48:14,395 --> 01:48:17,230
...but your spirit lingers on.

1132
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:24,559
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

1133
01:48:39,753 --> 01:48:43,371
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1134
01:48:43,548 --> 01:48:47,249
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1135
01:48:47,427 --> 01:48:52,587
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1136
01:48:52,766 --> 01:48:57,926
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1137
01:48:58,104 --> 01:48:59,682
Poof.

1138
01:48:59,856 --> 01:49:03,059
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

1139
01:49:03,234 --> 01:49:06,935
But that's life, I suppose.

1140
01:49:07,113 --> 01:49:12,451
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1141
01:49:12,618 --> 01:49:16,283
- Poof.
- Poof.

1142
01:49:30,844 --> 01:49:33,965
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1143
01:49:34,974 --> 01:49:39,268
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1144
01:49:40,188 --> 01:49:43,143
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1145
01:49:43,942 --> 01:49:47,477
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1146
01:49:49,031 --> 01:49:51,486
As I watched, it sank.

1147
01:49:52,993 --> 01:49:55,828
Just before it reached the bottom...

1148
01:49:55,996 --> 01:49:57,454
...it transformed...

1149
01:49:58,832 --> 01:50:00,659
...into a wee fish.

1150
01:50:02,335 --> 01:50:04,458
It was beautiful magic.

1151
01:50:05,463 --> 01:50:07,705
Wondrous to behold.

1152
01:50:10,343 --> 01:50:13,095
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1153
01:50:15,473 --> 01:50:16,505
Your mother.

1154
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:21,051
The day I came downstairs...

1155
01:50:22,022 --> 01:50:24,311
...the day the bowl was empty...

1156
01:50:25,859 --> 01:50:28,017
...was the day your mother...

1157
01:50:32,032 --> 01:50:34,024
I know why you're here.

1158
01:50:37,037 --> 01:50:39,029
But I can't help you.

1159
01:50:40,832 --> 01:50:42,540
It would ruin me.

1160
01:50:46,254 --> 01:50:48,709
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1161
01:50:49,257 --> 01:50:51,083
The night I got this?

1162
01:50:52,844 --> 01:50:54,468
Because of her.

1163
01:50:55,388 --> 01:50:57,179
Because she sacrificed herself.

1164
01:50:57,598 --> 01:50:59,971
Because she refused to step aside.

1165
01:51:00,143 --> 01:51:03,346
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1166
01:51:03,522 --> 01:51:07,222
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1167
01:51:08,068 --> 01:51:10,191
I'm going to tell you something.

1168
01:51:11,112 --> 01:51:14,066
Something others have only guessed at.

1169
01:51:16,034 --> 01:51:17,528
It's true.

1170
01:51:18,119 --> 01:51:19,399
I am the Chosen One.

1171
01:51:20,413 --> 01:51:22,619
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1172
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:26,076
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1173
01:51:26,252 --> 01:51:28,624
...and I need to know what you told him.

1174
01:51:29,338 --> 01:51:31,746
Be brave, professor.

1175
01:51:33,384 --> 01:51:35,460
Be brave like my mother.

1176
01:51:36,762 --> 01:51:39,431
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1177
01:51:40,558 --> 01:51:42,846
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1178
01:51:43,852 --> 01:51:49,060
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1179
01:51:59,618 --> 01:52:02,738
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1180
01:52:04,749 --> 01:52:08,034
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1181
01:52:44,789 --> 01:52:47,493
I was in the library the other night...

1182
01:52:47,666 --> 01:52:49,825
...in the Restricted Section...

1183
01:52:50,711 --> 01:52:54,329
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1184
01:52:55,632 --> 01:52:58,384
It's called, as I understand it...

1185
01:52:59,678 --> 01:53:01,006
...a Horcrux.

1186
01:53:02,848 --> 01:53:05,599
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1187
01:53:06,017 --> 01:53:08,688
I came across the term while reading...

1188
01:53:08,855 --> 01:53:11,855
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1189
01:53:12,024 --> 01:53:13,768
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1190
01:53:13,943 --> 01:53:16,516
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1191
01:53:16,695 --> 01:53:18,238
Which is...

1192
01:53:19,365 --> 01:53:21,191
...why I came to you.

1193
01:53:24,036 --> 01:53:29,659
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1194
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:32,455
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1195
01:53:35,047 --> 01:53:39,044
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1196
01:53:39,217 --> 01:53:42,835
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1197
01:53:43,013 --> 01:53:44,127
Protected?

1198
01:53:44,306 --> 01:53:47,509
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1199
01:53:48,977 --> 01:53:51,385
In other words, you cannot die.

1200
01:53:58,570 --> 01:54:01,737
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1201
01:54:01,907 --> 01:54:04,694
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1202
01:54:05,911 --> 01:54:07,405
Murder.

1203
01:54:07,913 --> 01:54:09,241
Yes.

1204
01:54:09,790 --> 01:54:14,701
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1205
01:54:15,587 --> 01:54:20,333
Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

1206
01:54:20,509 --> 01:54:22,004
Seven?

1207
01:54:22,762 --> 01:54:28,052
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1208
01:54:28,225 --> 01:54:31,974
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1209
01:54:33,147 --> 01:54:36,183
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1210
01:54:40,946 --> 01:54:42,274
Of course, sir.

1211
01:54:45,242 --> 01:54:47,234
It'll be our little secret.

1212
01:54:56,044 --> 01:54:57,289
Sir.

1213
01:55:12,685 --> 01:55:14,808
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1214
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:17,649
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1215
01:55:17,816 --> 01:55:20,936
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1216
01:55:21,111 --> 01:55:22,142
What are they exactly?

1217
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:25,654
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1218
01:55:28,827 --> 01:55:30,535
A ring, for example.

1219
01:55:31,162 --> 01:55:32,656
Or a book.

1220
01:55:33,957 --> 01:55:36,329
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1221
01:55:36,834 --> 01:55:38,957
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1222
01:55:39,128 --> 01:55:41,417
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1223
01:55:41,589 --> 01:55:43,498
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1224
01:55:43,674 --> 01:55:48,669
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1225
01:55:48,846 --> 01:55:50,839
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1226
01:55:51,223 --> 01:55:55,969
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1227
01:55:56,145 --> 01:56:00,013
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1228
01:56:00,191 --> 01:56:01,354
One destroys Voldemort.

1229
01:56:01,526 --> 01:56:04,444
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1230
01:56:04,612 --> 01:56:07,862
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1231
01:56:21,837 --> 01:56:23,711
...leaves traces.

1232
01:56:31,514 --> 01:56:33,589
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1233
01:56:33,766 --> 01:56:36,054
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1234
01:56:36,895 --> 01:56:39,979
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1235
01:56:40,148 --> 01:56:44,229
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1236
01:56:45,779 --> 01:56:50,441
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1237
01:56:54,413 --> 01:56:56,701
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1238
01:56:56,873 --> 01:56:59,495
...that you take too much for granted?

1239
01:56:59,668 --> 01:57:04,709
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1240
01:57:04,881 --> 01:57:07,004
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1241
01:57:07,884 --> 01:57:13,673
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1242
01:57:32,074 --> 01:57:33,699
Oh, Harry.

1243
01:57:36,287 --> 01:57:38,612
You need a shave, my friend.

1244
01:57:41,417 --> 01:57:45,628
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1245
01:57:45,796 --> 01:57:49,746
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1246
01:57:51,301 --> 01:57:53,673
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1247
01:57:54,137 --> 01:57:55,632
I'm an old man.

1248
01:57:55,806 --> 01:57:57,466
You still look the same to me, sir.

1249
01:57:58,934 --> 01:58:01,935
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1250
01:58:02,103 --> 01:58:05,307
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1251
01:58:08,069 --> 01:58:12,565
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1252
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:16,239
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1253
01:58:16,410 --> 01:58:18,237
But there is one condition:

1254
01:58:18,412 --> 01:58:21,615
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1255
01:58:22,499 --> 01:58:24,124
Yes, sir.

1256
01:58:24,293 --> 01:58:26,416
You do understand what I'm saying?

1257
01:58:27,004 --> 01:58:29,495
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1258
01:58:29,673 --> 01:58:31,998
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1259
01:58:32,175 --> 01:58:36,173
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1260
01:58:41,351 --> 01:58:42,928
Your word, Harry.

1261
01:58:44,562 --> 01:58:46,056
My word.

1262
01:58:46,856 --> 01:58:48,516
Take my arm.

1263
01:58:49,944 --> 01:58:52,351
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1264
01:58:53,030 --> 01:58:56,482
Well, being me has its privileges.

1265
01:59:43,748 --> 01:59:45,372
This is the place.

1266
01:59:46,167 --> 01:59:47,744
Oh, yes.

1267
01:59:48,669 --> 01:59:51,243
This place has known magic.

1268
01:59:59,263 --> 02:00:00,805
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

1269
02:00:00,973 --> 02:00:02,384
...payment must be made.

1270
02:00:02,558 --> 02:00:06,176
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1271
02:00:07,771 --> 02:00:09,598
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1272
02:00:10,065 --> 02:00:12,770
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1273
02:00:34,672 --> 02:00:39,299
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1274
02:00:39,468 --> 02:00:42,802
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1275
02:00:45,391 --> 02:00:46,802
Careful.

1276
02:01:10,333 --> 02:01:11,447
There it is.

1277
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,666
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1278
02:01:37,860 --> 02:01:39,687
If you would, Harry.

1279
02:02:26,993 --> 02:02:29,401
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1280
02:02:30,038 --> 02:02:31,413
Oh, yes.

1281
02:02:42,509 --> 02:02:44,086
It has to be drunk.

1282
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:47,095
All of it has to be drunk.

1283
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:51,264
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1284
02:02:51,434 --> 02:02:53,841
This potion might paralyze me.

1285
02:02:54,270 --> 02:02:55,930
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1286
02:02:56,731 --> 02:03:00,016
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1287
02:03:00,276 --> 02:03:02,185
You are not to indulge these requests.

1288
02:03:02,361 --> 02:03:05,896
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1289
02:03:06,073 --> 02:03:08,529
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1290
02:03:08,993 --> 02:03:11,115
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1291
02:03:11,286 --> 02:03:16,707
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1292
02:03:20,629 --> 02:03:22,705
Your good health, Harry.

1293
02:03:38,856 --> 02:03:40,136
Professor.

1294
02:03:42,276 --> 02:03:43,474
Professor!

1295
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,654
Harry.

1296
02:03:51,828 --> 02:03:54,319
Professor, can you hear me?

1297
02:03:55,623 --> 02:03:56,786
Professor.

1298
02:04:12,223 --> 02:04:13,337
No. Don't.

1299
02:04:13,516 --> 02:04:15,841
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?

1300
02:04:25,110 --> 02:04:26,984
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

1301
02:04:27,154 --> 02:04:31,566
...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

1302
02:04:31,742 --> 02:04:33,865
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

1303
02:04:34,036 --> 02:04:36,325
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1304
02:04:38,249 --> 02:04:39,328
It's my fault.

1305
02:04:41,002 --> 02:04:42,200
It's all my fault.

1306
02:04:44,046 --> 02:04:45,671
It's my fault.

1307
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:49,208
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...

1308
02:04:49,885 --> 02:04:52,210
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1309
02:04:52,388 --> 02:04:54,214
- I promise.
- No.

1310
02:04:55,265 --> 02:04:56,641
Please.

1311
02:05:20,791 --> 02:05:22,250
Harry.

1312
02:05:29,383 --> 02:05:30,414
Water.

1313
02:05:31,426 --> 02:05:32,541
Water.

1314
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:34,511
Water.

1315
02:05:41,019 --> 02:05:42,810
You did it, sir.

1316
02:05:42,979 --> 02:05:44,438
Look.

1317
02:05:46,441 --> 02:05:47,686
Harry.

1318
02:05:49,069 --> 02:05:50,398
Water.

1319
02:05:52,156 --> 02:05:53,816
Aguamenti.

1320
02:05:54,033 --> 02:05:55,491
Water.

1321
02:06:31,653 --> 02:06:33,028
Lumos.

1322
02:07:01,474 --> 02:07:03,383
Lumos Maxima!

1323
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:14,687
Harry.

1324
02:07:18,741 --> 02:07:19,856
Sectumsempra!

1325
02:07:20,034 --> 02:07:21,196
Harry.

1326
02:07:22,161 --> 02:07:23,786
- Stupefy!
- Harry.

1327
02:08:22,973 --> 02:08:24,253
Harry.

1328
02:08:28,270 --> 02:08:30,595
Partis Temporus!

1329
02:09:13,147 --> 02:09:16,266
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1330
02:09:57,107 --> 02:10:00,807
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1331
02:10:03,238 --> 02:10:04,613
No.

1332
02:10:05,657 --> 02:10:08,326
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1333
02:10:08,493 --> 02:10:12,028
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1334
02:10:12,205 --> 02:10:13,865
Speak to no one else.

1335
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:16,706
Severus, Harry.

1336
02:10:22,007 --> 02:10:24,415
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1337
02:10:25,887 --> 02:10:28,888
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1338
02:10:29,057 --> 02:10:32,841
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1339
02:10:33,644 --> 02:10:35,304
Harry, do as I say.

1340
02:10:38,941 --> 02:10:40,222
Trust me.

1341
02:10:41,986 --> 02:10:43,445
Trust me.

1342
02:11:04,008 --> 02:11:05,835
Good evening, Draco.

1343
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:10,254
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

1344
02:11:10,431 --> 02:11:12,174
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

1345
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:16,430
I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

1346
02:11:18,564 --> 02:11:21,399
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?

1347
02:11:23,903 --> 02:11:25,361
Draco...

1348
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:28,984
...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?

1349
02:11:29,158 --> 02:11:30,949
I've done things that would shock you.

1350
02:11:31,118 --> 02:11:35,246
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

1351
02:11:35,414 --> 02:11:38,035
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?

1352
02:11:38,208 --> 02:11:39,786
Forgive me, Draco.

1353
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:42,451
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

1354
02:11:42,629 --> 02:11:45,001
...your heart can't really
have been in them.

1355
02:11:45,173 --> 02:11:48,376
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1356
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:53,971
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1357
02:11:54,140 --> 02:11:55,800
Expelliarmus!

1358
02:11:59,145 --> 02:12:01,470
Very good. Very good.

1359
02:12:03,232 --> 02:12:04,691
You're not alone.

1360
02:12:05,777 --> 02:12:06,808
There are others.

1361
02:12:08,863 --> 02:12:10,274
How?

1362
02:12:11,574 --> 02:12:14,243
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1363
02:12:14,994 --> 02:12:17,366
- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.

1364
02:12:17,538 --> 02:12:20,492
It has a sister. A twin.

1365
02:12:20,666 --> 02:12:22,873
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

1366
02:12:23,044 --> 02:12:24,836
Ingenious.

1367
02:12:25,505 --> 02:12:26,750
Draco...

1368
02:12:26,923 --> 02:12:33,008
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1369
02:12:33,930 --> 02:12:36,847
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!

1370
02:12:37,642 --> 02:12:41,141
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

1371
02:12:42,355 --> 02:12:44,016
I have to kill you.

1372
02:12:44,650 --> 02:12:46,689
Or he's gonna kill me.

1373
02:12:56,202 --> 02:12:59,821
Well, look what we have here.

1374
02:13:01,708 --> 02:13:03,866
Well done, Draco.

1375
02:13:07,548 --> 02:13:09,375
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1376
02:13:10,426 --> 02:13:12,584
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?

1377
02:13:12,761 --> 02:13:17,886
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1378
02:13:18,517 --> 02:13:19,892
Do it.

1379
02:13:21,186 --> 02:13:25,314
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

1380
02:13:25,732 --> 02:13:27,226
Let me finish him in my own way.

1381
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:31,018
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

1382
02:13:31,196 --> 02:13:33,235
This is your moment. Do it.

1383
02:13:34,783 --> 02:13:36,775
Go on, Draco.

1384
02:13:36,951 --> 02:13:39,110
Now!

1385
02:13:40,371 --> 02:13:41,700
No.

1386
02:13:53,593 --> 02:13:55,136
Severus.

1387
02:14:04,145 --> 02:14:05,604
Please.

1388
02:14:06,606 --> 02:14:07,934
Avada Kedavra.

1389
02:15:12,338 --> 02:15:15,790
Hagrid! Hello?

1390
02:15:15,967 --> 02:15:20,012
Snape! He trusted you!

1391
02:15:24,350 --> 02:15:25,975
Go on.

1392
02:15:26,644 --> 02:15:28,352
Incarcerous.

1393
02:15:28,521 --> 02:15:31,190
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1394
02:15:32,817 --> 02:15:36,020
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1395
02:15:56,173 --> 02:15:57,549
Sectumsempra!

1396
02:16:06,017 --> 02:16:11,259
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

1397
02:16:12,022 --> 02:16:13,185
Yes.

1398
02:16:13,899 --> 02:16:18,063
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1399
02:20:06,131 --> 02:20:07,589
McGONAGALL:
Potter...

1400
02:20:08,299 --> 02:20:10,790
...in light of what has happened...

1401
02:20:12,220 --> 02:20:15,505
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1402
02:20:17,475 --> 02:20:21,473
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

1403
02:20:23,314 --> 02:20:25,770
...you meant a great deal to him.

1404
02:20:44,042 --> 02:20:46,201
Do you think he would've done it?

1405
02:20:46,378 --> 02:20:48,252
Draco?

1406
02:20:49,339 --> 02:20:50,668
No.

1407
02:20:51,842 --> 02:20:53,881
No, he was lowering his wand.

1408
02:20:54,928 --> 02:20:56,886
In the end, it was Snape.

1409
02:20:57,515 --> 02:20:59,970
It was always Snape.

1410
02:21:00,142 --> 02:21:02,349
And I did nothing.

1411
02:21:09,026 --> 02:21:10,437
It's fake.

1412
02:21:12,029 --> 02:21:13,357
Open it.

1413
02:21:24,374 --> 02:21:28,372
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...

1414
02:21:28,545 --> 02:21:32,210
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.

1415
02:21:33,216 --> 02:21:37,083
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.

1416
02:21:37,262 --> 02:21:40,299
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...

1417
02:21:40,474 --> 02:21:42,716
...you will be mortal once more.

1418
02:21:44,019 --> 02:21:45,679
R.A.B."

1419
02:21:46,939 --> 02:21:48,398
R.A.B.

1420
02:21:48,774 --> 02:21:50,054
Don't know.

1421
02:21:52,069 --> 02:21:54,738
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1422
02:21:55,697 --> 02:21:57,240
Which means it was all a waste.

1423
02:21:58,576 --> 02:22:00,070
All of it.

1424
02:22:06,292 --> 02:22:08,368
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1425
02:22:08,878 --> 02:22:10,372
You and Ginny.

1426
02:22:11,005 --> 02:22:14,705
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1427
02:22:16,051 --> 02:22:18,044
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1428
02:22:19,221 --> 02:22:21,926
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1429
02:22:22,099 --> 02:22:24,935
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1430
02:22:25,103 --> 02:22:28,721
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

1431
02:22:30,066 --> 02:22:32,687
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1432
02:22:32,860 --> 02:22:35,530
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1433
02:22:38,574 --> 02:22:40,816
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

1434
02:22:40,993 --> 02:22:43,365
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

1435
02:22:47,625 --> 02:22:49,285
You need us, Harry.

1436
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:08,184
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.

Collins, vanished nine days ago.</i>

[distant chatter]

21
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:25,106
You don't tell me
what to do in this house.

22
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,342
This is my house.
These are my rules!

23
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:30,177
[girl] You're the baby 'cause
you went through my stuff!

24
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:33,147
[sighs] How many times have I
asked you to use the doorbell?

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,882
[girl] I'll be ready
in a minute, Dad.

26
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:37,185
Mom snooped through
my social media.

27
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:38,954
You have no right
to do that.

28
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:40,655
I have every right
to do that, young lady.

29
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:42,623
- You should've asked her first.
- [girl] See?

30
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:44,925
Would you like to see the photos
your daughter's posting of herself?

31
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:49,197
Or the conversations she's having
with complete and total strangers?

32
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:54,602
[girl] It's nothing compared to the
naked selfies Kim and Kylie post.

33
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:58,907
Sorry, Dad.
I'll take it down.

34
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:02,644
- I'm ready for school.
- Sit down.

35
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:10,018
Now, show me these people
you've been talking to.

36
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,920
You mean, boys?

37
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:14,623
You can talk to boys.

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,226
Boys are gonna try
and talk to you.

39
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:22,165
I didn't accept their friend requests.
Some of them messaged me, though.

40
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:25,168
- And you replied?
- They were being so annoying.

41
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:28,304
They were baiting you.
And you fell for it.

42
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:32,442
Assess the situation like I taught
you how to do in the real world.

43
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,446
Malcolm here.
All of his photos are by himself.

44
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:39,115
And look at his camera angles.
He's trying to make it look

45
00:03:39,248 --> 00:03:41,118
like someone else
is taking the picture.

46
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,320
And all of his friends
are girls.

47
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:48,091
Do you get his MO Now?

48
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:51,328
Men are...

49
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,964
Pigs. I know.

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,099
Can we go to school now?

51
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:00,337
Yeah. Get your stuff.

52
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:05,876
[man] Think of it like a...
a roller coaster.

53
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:10,347
You'll be nervous
to start with.

54
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:12,615
Even scared a little.

55
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:18,921
But once you get started,
uh, the rush you feel...

56
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:20,891
Thanks for my phone,
by the way.

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,129
That's a secret phone,
remember?

58
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:50,455
So, why don't we start by each
taking off a piece of our clothes?

59
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:52,290
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

60
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,468
Sexy.

61
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,336
[chuckles] Really?

62
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,271
No, dickhead.

63
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:08,306
[grunts]

64

[police radio chattering]

65
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,132
The driver found her when
he unloaded the cargo.

66
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,068
Female, Caucasian,
thirties.

67
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,372
There's multiple breaks.
Left arm, both legs.

68
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:41,907
- Jumper?
- I'd say so.

69
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,043
She didn't die on impact,
but given her injuries

70
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:46,045
and the temperature,
shortly after.

71
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,418
I'd estimate she landed from
a height of over 15 feet.

72
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,098
Ask the driver
if he stopped for gas.

73
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,335
Then check the bridges
along his route.

74
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,072
They might have CCTV
or security cameras.

75
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,875
She major cartilage damage on her wrists
and calcified bruising on the bone.

76
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,844
- She was tied up.
- Looks like it.

77
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,114
She was also given vitamin
supplements and birth control.

78
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,651
Whoever did this
blew her eardrums out,

79
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,353
but her cranium
was still intact.

80
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,722
The lab thinks it was some
kind of pressurized device.

81
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,423
Have you ID'd her yet?

82
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:34,328
No. Whoever did this took a
lot of patience and dedication.

83
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:38,699
And, uh, if we're lucky,
it's a lone case of infatuation.

84
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:43,271
Yeah. And if we're not, it's a guy who
wants his guests to be permanent residents.

85
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,282
Hey! My gosh.
How are you?

86
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,152
Okay. Um...

87
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:00,187
So I'm guessing
you work cyber now.

88
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,957
- I gave up the lounge chair.
- Hmm.

89
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:06,327
I'm a profiler now. I guide their
interactions with suspects online...

90
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,030
I can't get into this interface.
It's not working.

91
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:10,632
Just grab this code trail,
lock onto it.

92
00:07:10,766 --> 00:07:12,301
It's a really delicate gig,

93
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,403
trying to coerce someone
into revealing an agenda

94
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,338
without pushing them
into one.

95
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:17,506
[man] Um, Rachel?

96
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,742
Pardon, sorry.
Your boy is back.

97
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,110
Okay.

98
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,279
All right.

99
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:28,418
Look, listen, I need some people checked
out on my daughter's social media.

100
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:31,653
Oh, that's good. You're in touch.
That's really good.

101
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,223
- And Angie... how is she?
- Just what I asked for.

102
00:07:36,358 --> 00:07:37,427
Thank you.

103
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,869
- [man] He seems nice.

[door closes]

106
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:01,517
What the fuck is this?

107
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:05,188
Who are you?

108
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:10,159
Listen, I... I haven't
done anything wrong.

109
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:13,731
Ninety-four girls groomed.

110
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:16,400
Looks like you met with thirteen of
them, had sex with four.

111
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:20,838
- Is this one more?
- I never... I never forced any of them.

112
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,807
There's little difference between
forcing yourself on someone

113
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,176
and influencing a girl
into submission.

114
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,479
[gasps] What the fuck?
I can't feel my...

115
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:31,648
$92,000 in savings,
another $8,000 in stocks.

116
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:36,320
I'll get... I'll get help.
I'll... I'll go to therapy.

117
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:39,490
Oh, you don't need that anymore.
It doesn't work anyway.

118
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:42,024
As highlighted
by your previous conviction.

119
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,562
Jesus fucking Christ.
What have you done to me?

120
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:46,764
Sign this.

121
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:50,300
Your savings will be divided
amongst the girls you abused.

122
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:54,872
[pills rattle]

123
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:58,142
Take one twice a day
for the rest of your life.

124
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:00,010
It's a testosterone
suppressant.

125
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:01,979
Your doctor will
prescribe it for you.

126
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:03,381
What's happening to me?

127
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:05,650
I've disarmed you.
It's still there.

128
00:09:05,784 --> 00:09:09,086
But it's now no longer possible
for you to get an erection.

129
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:10,488
I've also had
your balls removed.

130
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:13,358
Not that you had any...
in the first place.

131
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,762
If you inform the police
of your rehabilitation,

132
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:22,534
I will release the images you have
poorly hidden on your computer

133
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,571
to your entire address book.

134
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:28,340
Do I make myself clear?

135
00:09:31,142 --> 00:09:34,412
[police radio chattering]

136
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:54,667
Why this one?

137
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,571
It's isolated. It's a long way on
foot in the cold from either side.

138
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:01,173
If she was being chased...

139
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,345
jumping was the only option.

140
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,019
I won't get much off this.

141
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:27,234
It should still be hot.

142
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,069
Oh, you got
the bread I like.

143
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:32,706
We need to get some proper
furniture for this place.

144
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:36,243
You want somewhere nice to sit?
I'll get you a sofa.

145
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:37,477
No, I meant for you.

146
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:39,379
There's sheets over everything.

147
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,281
It's just weird.
It's a house. You sit down.

148
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:42,782
These are for you.

149
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:47,855
- No, these are nice.
- There's a transmitter in them.

150
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:49,256
Okay, that's so nice.

151
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:52,058
The emit a signal that
feeds off cell phones.

152
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,195
As long as you're near one,
I'll be able to track you.

153
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:01,335
Do you have to use that one?
I look so rough.

154
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:04,205
Hey, you want to help me
a second with this? I got...

155
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,877
- Where's my file?
- Uh, Rachel took it.

156

He was a judge.
And a good one.

He handled a lot of

- Yes.

a tracker and he's using her as bait.

Judas's whore is dead.

477
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:43,190
Come, servants.
Feed on my feet.

478
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:48,163
The fire, the ice.

479
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:52,065
The creeper who raped me.

480
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,337
His blood money
I let silence me.

481
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:59,974
Shame on you all.

482
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:02,010
Shame.

483
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:05,480
I hate you.

484
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,582
I love you.

485
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:14,356
I tried to hide us,
but the devil sees everything.

486
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,560
My evil, evil boy.

487
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,831
My sweet, sweet boy.

488
00:42:21,963 --> 00:42:23,998
Mommy's so sorry.

489
00:42:26,035 --> 00:42:28,203
This winterbug is free."

[slurping]

494
00:43:38,276 --> 00:43:40,011
So, like, will it hurt?

495
00:43:40,143 --> 00:43:44,047
[chuckles]
No. Don't be silly.

496
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,625
- Where's Cooper?
- Hey, man.

497
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:56,527
Oh, fucking ball-sacs.

498
00:43:56,661 --> 00:43:59,998
I... I was... I was
just being a friend.

499
00:44:00,164 --> 00:44:01,667
I need Cooper.

500
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,001
He can hear you.

501
00:44:03,868 --> 00:44:06,270
I'm sorry, okay?
I just want to go.

502
00:44:07,204 --> 00:44:11,577
Put those on
or I will let them castrate you.

503
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,715
[man chuckles nervously]

504
00:44:45,778 --> 00:44:48,881
[sighs] I'm not surprised
by what you're up against.

505
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:51,717
Predators may act in solitary,

506
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,553
but their instincts
are quite the opposite.

507
00:44:54,686 --> 00:44:58,658
They take comfort in knowing that there are
others out there just like them, all alone.

508
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:00,893
Please, continue to enlighten me
on the nature of criminals.

509
00:45:01,027 --> 00:45:02,896
Well, it's the reason
your men are dying, isn't it?

510
00:45:04,864 --> 00:45:06,766
Simon's got friends.

511
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,435
[doorbell rings]

512
00:45:11,771 --> 00:45:13,874
[ringing]

513
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:16,743
Hi.

514
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:18,277
What are you cunts
doing here?

515
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:20,580
That is not nice. We...

516
00:45:22,682 --> 00:45:26,353
For the record, I have
no legal right or claim

517
00:45:26,487 --> 00:45:28,254
over anything
on this property.

518
00:45:28,388 --> 00:45:31,391
You guys are here illegally,
and now anything you find on that computer

519
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:33,861
is inadmissible
in a court of law.

520
00:45:33,994 --> 00:45:36,563
- Shit.
- Yeah. Fucktards.

521
00:45:38,265 --> 00:45:39,500
Hey, what's he doing, anyway?

522
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,202
I'm hacking Simon's
virtual drive

523
00:45:43,336 --> 00:45:45,372
from what it thinks
is a trusted source

524
00:45:45,506 --> 00:45:47,241
through
to the exchange.

525
00:45:47,975 --> 00:45:49,176
Why are you helping him?

526
00:45:49,643 --> 00:45:50,979
Because he never tried
to fuck me,

527
00:45:51,112 --> 00:45:52,412
and wouldn't, if he could.

528
00:45:53,013 --> 00:45:54,948
He's decent. Most men
are fucking gross.

529
00:45:55,082 --> 00:45:56,283
Not all men
are gross.

530
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:57,651
Oh, yours isn't?

531
00:45:58,385 --> 00:45:59,687
No, mine is.

532
00:46:01,156 --> 00:46:03,257
- [beeps]
- [man] I'm in.

533
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:08,763
Who are you?

534
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:11,866
How many cases have you worked
where guilt is obvious

535
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,668
but the jury had to ignore
a piece of evidence?

536
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:16,837
Like a rapist who buys
his way out of a case.

537
00:46:16,971 --> 00:46:20,875
Suddenly someone has the courage
to refuse his offer to pay her off.

538
00:46:21,976 --> 00:46:23,344
Prosecutes.

539
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:26,514
Jury will never hear
what he's done before.

540
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:28,883
Doesn't really give you
the right to run around,

541
00:46:29,017 --> 00:46:30,752
hacking people's nuts off,
though, does it?

542
00:46:30,885 --> 00:46:34,622
If a lion eats someone
and you lock it up

543
00:46:34,756 --> 00:46:36,892
and you say,
"Don't do that again,"

544
00:46:37,026 --> 00:46:39,260
then ten years later,
you let it out, what happens?

545
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:40,929
Not all criminals
are animals.

546
00:46:41,062 --> 00:46:42,098
Some are wired to be.

547
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:45,433
Eighty percent of sex offenders re-offend.
Eighty percent.

548
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:49,038
Yet we knowingly let them
back out onto the street.

549
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:52,841
Seven this last month released
within 15 miles of this school.

550
00:46:52,975 --> 00:46:56,011
That's five out of seven
active predators.

551
00:46:56,645 --> 00:46:57,980
Unless you treat
the underlying cause

552
00:46:58,114 --> 00:47:00,716
of their instinct
to offend: Hormones.

553
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:05,420
When you do that, the re-offend
rate drops to just five percent.

554
00:47:05,554 --> 00:47:07,690
You can't think someone's
gonna commit a crime

555
00:47:07,823 --> 00:47:10,392
regardless of any of
the social factors,

556
00:47:10,526 --> 00:47:13,663
because that is
dangerously narrow-minded.

557
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,631
It's like thinking
all Muslims are terrorists.

558
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:17,633
I'm not talking about
the color of a man's skin.

559
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:21,270
I'm talking about the endless
voice in a predator's head

560
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:23,874
that says,
"Do it, do it, do it."

561
00:47:28,944 --> 00:47:31,280
You're too stubborn
to ask why.

562
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:36,887
I know why.
You think you got punished

563
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,422
for letting all those
sex offenders out of prison.

564
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,729
What happened
to your family...

565
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,166
was a tragedy.

566
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,500
And no matter how many
predators you treat...

567
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,871
that guilty you're feeling...

568
00:47:58,441 --> 00:47:59,877
it never goes away.

569
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:18,696
We hacked his server. He was talking
to someone called Hunter. Hunter71.

570
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,834
Explosive in the car was pentaerythritol
tetranitrate. Commonly used.

571
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:25,304
However, the compounds
in the trigger are unique.

572
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:28,673
High-intensity, stable,
low surrounding impact, and dense.

573
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:30,808
Expensive. Military grade.

574
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:34,246
Simon said that Santa comes and drops
money off at the house every year.

575
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,148
Maybe Santa pays
the bomb maker.

576
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:39,684
Run a search for military
personnel in the state,

577
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:41,652
born 1971.

578
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:46,625
Okay. Which one of those
are trained in explosives?

579
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,661
No longer in service.

580
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:14,687
- [gunshot]
- He's hit! Shots fired!

581
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:16,989
Pop smoke!

582
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,259
[gunfire]

583
00:49:19,391 --> 00:49:21,560
[indistinct shouting]

584
00:49:25,698 --> 00:49:27,733
[shouting continues]

585
00:49:38,811 --> 00:49:41,180
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Turn around!

586
00:49:41,314 --> 00:49:43,016
Stay back! Stay back!

587
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,585
Wait!

588
00:49:49,356 --> 00:49:51,091
We both know
why you're here.

589
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:57,730
You sold a trigger explosive to a man who
abducted and killed more than ten women.

590
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:01,635
- What?
- Don't you have a fucking newspaper?

591
00:50:05,471 --> 00:50:06,606
What else
did you make him?

592
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:10,444
Uh, a signal blocker
for cell phones.

593
00:50:10,577 --> 00:50:11,812
It was nothing.

594
00:50:13,047 --> 00:50:14,249
[sighs]

595
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,952
That was the guy who
locked up all those women?

596
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:20,521
Yeah. Someone out there
has been...

597
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:21,889
[gunshot]

598
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:33,734
[sighs]

599
00:50:49,951 --> 00:50:51,752
[sniffs]

600
00:50:59,228 --> 00:51:00,729
Tell me about your mommy.

601
00:51:03,732 --> 00:51:05,133
Tell me about her.

602
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:09,071
I bet she hated you.

603
00:51:14,577 --> 00:51:16,678
She loved me.
She protected me.

604
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:18,981
Protected you from what?

605
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:23,352
She didn't take care of you.
She didn't love you.

606
00:51:23,919 --> 00:51:25,888
- You...
- No one loves you.

607
00:51:26,655 --> 00:51:28,823
No one. You have nobody.

608
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:30,993
- No.
- You have nobody to keep you company...

609
00:51:31,127 --> 00:51:32,595
- No.
- ...except your reflection.

610
00:51:32,728 --> 00:51:34,196
You're a freak.

611
00:51:34,331 --> 00:51:36,966
Where's the other Simon?
I want to talk to him.

612
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,503
- Rachel, don't.
- Come on. Come on.

613
00:51:40,636 --> 00:51:42,805
- What is it? You like tits?
- No.

614
00:51:42,938 --> 00:51:44,573
- You like to chain women up?
- No.

615
00:51:44,707 --> 00:51:46,109
Yes, you do. Come on.

616
00:51:46,243 --> 00:51:47,710
- Come on, Simon.
- Don't do that.

617
00:51:47,844 --> 00:51:49,312
Come on!
What did she do to you?

618
00:51:49,446 --> 00:51:50,647
- [buzzing]
- Come on!

619
00:51:50,781 --> 00:51:51,847
- Tell me what she did to you!
- No.

620
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:53,283
- Tell me.
- Rachel, no.

621
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:55,851
What? What did she
do to you? Tell me!

622
00:51:55,986 --> 00:51:57,620
- Come on!
- She never let me play!

623
00:51:57,754 --> 00:51:59,823
She always kept me
locked in a cage

624
00:51:59,956 --> 00:52:02,360
like a monkey!
Like a monkey!

625
00:52:02,493 --> 00:52:04,693
What did you do to her?
What did you do to your mom?

626
00:52:04,827 --> 00:52:06,830
- [buzzing continues]
- They made me.

627
00:52:06,963 --> 00:52:09,699
- They told me to do it.
- Who's they?

628
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,335
- They told me...
- Who's they?

629
00:52:11,469 --> 00:52:13,171
- They told me to.
- Who's they?

630
00:52:13,304 --> 00:52:14,539
They told...

631
00:52:15,439 --> 00:52:17,474
- Fuck me! Who's they? Who's they?
- [screaming]

632
00:52:17,607 --> 00:52:19,342
Who's they?
The voices in your head?

633
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:22,547
Tell me who it is!

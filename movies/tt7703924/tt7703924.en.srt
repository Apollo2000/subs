3
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,700
I believe in fate.

4
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,838
I believe the universe
has a plan for me.

5
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,742
For... For you,
for everybody.

6
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,085
Doesn't it, really?

7
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,189
So, my question is...

8
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,394
is this my destiny?

9
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,670
Is this what
I've been fighting for?

10
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,441
Hi.

11
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,909
My name is Arielle.

12
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,246
And for as long
as I can remember...

13
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,684
I knew I was going
to be famous.

14
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,892
Ew.

15
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:21,794
What is he doing here?

16
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:25,463
Hey. Club called me,
and some of the girls didn't show again.

17
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,533
Bobby's gonna stick around
until I get back.

18
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,502
So what, he just got
locked out

19
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:32,037
- out of his fucking trailer again?
- Quit your bitching, Ariel.

20
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,508
- Fuckin' assholes.
- Ma, I don't need a babysitter,

21
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,109
and he's got
his own place.

22
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,578
- This is our house.
- It is my house.

23
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,681
You start paying rent,
you can tell me who gets to stay here.

24
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,719
Leftover KFC in the fridge.

25
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:51,491
She's way too fucking good
for you, you know that?

26
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,561
But you ain't.

27
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,499
- You're a real piece of shit.
- Got any pot?

28
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,433
Yeah, I... I do,

29
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,571
and guess
who's not fucking getting any.

30
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,951
Hey!

31
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,688
What the fuck?

32
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,957
Ooh...

33
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,564
Hit that bitch.

34
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:47,873
Maybe if you weren't
such a slut.

35
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,942
She's a cunt.

36
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:51,343
The video is everywhere.

37
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,978
Yeah. Even and my cousin
and his friends said they saw it.

38
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,652
I can't believe Jeremy
hasn't liked any of my fucking photos.

39
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,565
You gonna say somethin'?

40
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:52,073
I, uh... I've never really
seen you around here before.

41
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,176
You saw me yesterday.

42
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:58,145
Well, I meant before that.

43
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:04,151
What are you doing?

44
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,788
Cylinder's misfiring.

45
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:13,493
Okay.

46
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,932
I'm staying with my dad.

47
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:22,903
So, are you gonna be staying
around for a while, then?

48
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,577
For a time, at least.

49
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:32,947
What's your name?

50
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:37,752
It's Dean.

51
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,554
Dean Taylor.

52
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:43,524
You?

53
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,597
You gotta earn
my name first, grease monkey.

54
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,803
Well, see you around,
Dean Taylor.

55
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,840
Two first names.

56
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,248
I'll have the Cobb salad
and an iced tea.

57
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,251
Okay.

58
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,657
I swear to God,
Jason told you.

59
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,225
Your cousin's the
biggest bullshit artist alive.

60
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:56,161
- He's not.
- He lies about everything, even stupid stuff.

61
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,763
- That's true.
- Whatever.

62
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:58,997
'Cause he was
totally in prison.

63
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,233
- Wait, who went to prison?
- Dean Taylor.

64
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:04,303
Hid dad owns that shitty
mechanic shop over on 2nd.

65
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:05,971
Hmm. Half the fucking town's
in prison.

66
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,540
I mean,
seems pretty all right.

67
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:10,776
Wait. I thought he was, like, living
with his mom in Kentucky or something.

68
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:13,147
- No, his mom is dead.
- She didn't die. She's just insane.

69
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,349
Did you fuck him?

70
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:19,985
No.

71
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,787
But I did put his dick
in my mouth.

72
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,822
- Fuck you, Stacey.
- Not all that surprising.

73
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,023
- God.
- Hmm?

74
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,992
I mean, he's like,
totally fuckable.

75
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,093
Prison fuckable.

76
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,394
I'd still do him.

77
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,731
Ew.

78
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,231
Hey.

79
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,167
Hi.

80
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,203
Get lost.

81
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,440
Slut.

82
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,013
You're a little firecracker, aren't ya?

83
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:21,982
So what are you doing here?

84
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:27,021
I'm gonna say that information
is at least worth a name.

85
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,526
I'm not Ariel, okay?

86
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:37,796
My mom, she fucking
named me after a mermaid,

87
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:41,702
but ain't nobody
ever gonna call me Ariel.

88
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,438
Arielle, then.

89
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,145
What about your old man?
He around?

90
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:56,982
Well...

91
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,117
Daddy called me
an accident and then...

92
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:03,123
Last time I ever saw him.

93
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,260
I got one like that, too.

94
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:09,897
Except you're
staying with yours.

95
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:17,838
I don't got a choice.

96
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:25,312
They say you were in prison.

97
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:29,517
"They"?

98
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:35,187
It's...

99
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:38,423
It's such a small town,
and juicy piece of gossip like that

100
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,794
would not fly under the radar.

101
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,003
So...

102
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,039
is it true?

103
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,476
Yeah, it's true.

104
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,115
So what did they
put you in prison for?

105
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:06,253
Armed robbery...

106
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,356
and assault.

107
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,295
Oh, that's exciting.

108
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,301
It is what it is.

109
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,935
My parole requires
I be with a parent,

110
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,006
and my mom's dead.
So I'm with my dad.

111
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:28,275
Oh.

112
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,846
I'm sorry
about your momma.

113
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,315
So what's your dad's
problem, then?

114
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:39,053
He's a fucking lousy drunk,
and he's...

115
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:40,921
bigger than me.

116
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,024
Ah.

117
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,840
Do you...

118
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,077
believe in, like, um...

119
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:09,617
like, faith and cosmic
coincidences and all that?

120
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,453
Nah, not really.

121
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:14,421
Well...

122
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:18,423
you know, there is a lot

123
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:21,228
to the universe that is way
beyond our understanding.

124
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:25,099
Have you ever heard
of the idea of, like...

125
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,503
if your put out

126
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:33,340
what you want into the universe,
that it'll give it to you?

127
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:36,578
What do you ask
the universe for?

128
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,313
Mmm...

129
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:49,087
Maybe if I'm worth it...

130
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:50,625
you'll have the chance
to find out.

131
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,563
I don't know, I just...

132
00:14:57,565 --> 00:15:01,066
I do know that first

133
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:05,971
I need to get the fuck out of
Florida, because...

134
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,741
Fuck this place. Seriously.

135
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:11,376
And I've just...

136
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,245
I've been saving up
a bunch of money,

137
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,682
and I'm just gonna leave.

138
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,416
All alone?

139
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,050
Maybe.

140
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,121
Maybe somebody will, um...

141
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:23,056
wanna come with me.

142
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,566
<i>I like to think
about getting famous,</i>

143
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:08,501
'cause people
around here, you know,

144
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:12,337
all they see is what's literally
right in front of them.

145
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:14,408
But not me.

146
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,479
<i>'Cause the world
is so much bigger...</i>

147
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:22,314
and vast, and...
And beautiful.

148
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,202
'Cause right now,
nobody gives a fuck about me. Nobody...

149
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,571
cares...

150
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,605
who I am.

151
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:47,239
<i>But that's all gonna change.</i>

152
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,274
People are gonna be
following me,

153
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:52,712
wondering what I'm doing,
where I'm going.

154
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:54,448
- <i>How?</i>
- <i>I don't know yet.</i>

155
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,849
I do know that...

156
00:16:56,851 --> 00:16:59,284
the first stop is Hollywood.

157
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:01,587
Us going to Hollywood.

158
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,125
Yeah, not sure my PO
would approve of that.

159
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:07,729
<i>Now, uh...</i>

160
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,796
life's got a really...

161
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:13,668
funny way of working itself out.
So we just gotta...

162
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:16,804
put it out there.

163
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:24,077
You wanna see something?

164
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:29,283
You gotta keep it a secret.

165
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,185
Ooh.

166
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:40,795
It's a .45.

167
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,362
It's big.

168
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,665
It'll stop anyone
coming your way.

169
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:47,602
You look sexy doing that.

170
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:50,570
All right.

171
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,304
Two hands. Two hands.

172
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,307
Okay.

173
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,144
Just aim and squeeze.

174
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,513
Hold it firm.
Watch the recoil.

175
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:01,616
Okay.

176
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,155
Ah!

177
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,388
Try again.

178
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,458
Whoo.

179
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,495
Ah, close.

180
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,612
Yeah!

181
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:33,815
Dean!

182
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:35,817
Oh, yeah.

183
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:42,489
- Go again.
- Okay.

184
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,059
<i>We're not
attacking you.</i>

185
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:48,259
We've just heard things,
and we're worried about you.

186
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,262
Why? 'Cause of some shit
her stupid dipshit cousin said?

187
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,430
Hey!

188
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,666
You're getting mad.

189
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:55,735
Because... Why are you all
attacking me?

190
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:58,938
- He killed somebody.
- He did not kill anybody.

191
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,240
See, this is why you guys
need to get your panties

192
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,476
out of Dean's problems
and in your own.

193
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,277
Because all you
give a fuck about

194
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,413
is prom or who fucked who.

195
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,649
Yeah, and how does this
end for you?

196
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:10,850
We're just telling you
to watch out.

197
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:14,920
It ends with me getting the
fuck out of this place, okay?

198
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,756
Because I ain't spending
the rest of my life

199
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:19,525
in some stupid speech hometown.

200
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:22,329
And what, you're gonna go off and
get famous or some shit like that?

201
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,463
Yes.

202
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,265
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

203
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,001
And what are you gonna
get famous for?

204
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:33,739
People are talking.

205
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:37,743
Like I give a flying fuck
what anybody else thinks!

206
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:38,880
Fuck you guys!

207
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,370
What?

208
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:14,949
Fuck.

209
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,470
Hey, fuck-face!
Where is it?

210
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:40,573
- Damn it!
- Get the fuck out of here!

211
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,008
- Calm down, Ma. Everyone's already seen your tits.
- Get the fuck out!

212
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,777
- Oh, my God!
- Where the fuck is it?

213
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:48,814
- Ariel, what the fuck are you doing here?
- A-ri-elle!

214
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:51,316
- For the last time, Mom. God!
- Shut your mouth!

215
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:54,419
Where is it, huh?
Where is it, you piece of shit?

216
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,522
- He stole my money, Ma.
- Baby, I'm so sorry.

217
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:58,891
- Ma, he stole my fucking money!
- Oh, my God.

218
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,860
Nobody stole... What the fuck
are you talking about?

219
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:03,562
You piece of shit!
Where is it?

220
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,366
He stole my money, Ma!

221
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,870
I didn't take
your fucking money, Ariel!

222
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:12,605
You should die! God!

223
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:13,939
Oh, my God!

224
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:18,944
- What other sick poor loser mooches off my mom, huh?
- Stop it!

225
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,411
Who else would've done it?

226
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,682
You're such a cunt.

227
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,685
Ariel...

228
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,521
I saved up

229
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:30,790
every dime I could

230
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:34,593
working in that
fucking shithole!

231
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:37,532
Get off him!

232
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,636
You fucking bitch!

233
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,023
I will fucking kill you.

234
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,693
What did you just say?

235
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:09,628
Jesus Christ.

236
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,600
Bobby said he didn't do it,
he didn't fucking do it!

237
00:22:17,972 --> 00:22:20,942
Fuck you both!

238
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:41,428
Fuck!

239
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:53,975
Come on. Come on.

240
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:58,145
<i>Hey, it's Dean.
Leave a message.</i>

241
00:22:59,013 --> 00:23:00,114
Fuck.

242
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:37,718
Dean!

243
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:47,762
Dean?

244
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,635
Dean?

245
00:23:57,939 --> 00:24:00,739
Fuck off! You...

246
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:03,709
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You piece of shit!

247
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:05,544
- You fucking worthless piece of...
- What the fuck are you doing?

248
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,279
- Get off him! Fucking get off him!
- What the...

249
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,816
Fucking bitch!

250
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:12,987
- Hey!
- Huh?

251
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:18,559
Arielle.

252
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:34,842
Oh.

253
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,979
Fuck! Oh, shit!

254
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:44,685
Is he...

255
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,487
Is he...

256
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:50,157
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

257
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,160
Fuck, you, uh...

258
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:55,995
It was an accident. I...
I didn't...

259
00:24:55,997 --> 00:24:58,130
Yeah. It was an accident.

260
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:00,132
It was an accident.

261
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:01,700
You were defending yourself.

262
00:25:01,702 --> 00:25:04,169
Arielle, they're gonna fucking...
They're gonna fucking find him like this,

263
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:06,071
they're gonna put this on me.
They're gonna bring me back.

264
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:09,208
No. No, no, no. You're not
going anywhere, okay?

265
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,176
- You're... You'll...
- No.

266
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,045
- Hey!
- No, no. Look, they're gonna...

267
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:14,747
It's fine. It's fine, okay?

268
00:25:14,749 --> 00:25:16,682
You're not going back.
We'll leave.

269
00:25:16,684 --> 00:25:18,784
That's what we'll do,
and they'll never find us.

270
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:19,820
You know what?

271
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,821
Arielle, I'm fucked.

272
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:24,590
- It doesn't matter.
- I'm fucked.

273
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,825
Hey, it's done now, okay?

274
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:30,129
The only thing that matters
is you and me.

275
00:25:30,131 --> 00:25:31,198
So we'll leave.

276
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,000
Tonight.

277
00:25:34,135 --> 00:25:36,037
- Right now.
- Okay.

278
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,150
Uh...

279
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:52,686
Do you have any money?

280
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,127
Well, not anymore.

281
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,268
I'm sorry about that.

282
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,775
Yeah, well...

283
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:21,082
We're gonna need
some fucking cash.

284
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:35,729
Did you bring the gun?

285
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,972
All right, I'm gonna drive up,
hop out, run inside quick.

286
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:48,843
And you wait outside
with the car.

287
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,680
What?

288
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:55,816
Just keep the car ready.

289
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:59,019
I'm not waiting outside.

290
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:02,890
- Look, baby doll...
- Baby, I will...

291
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:06,458
stay by the door,
I'll keep an eye on the car.

292
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,694
We'll keep it running.

293
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:10,965
But I'm coming in.
I'm not staying outside.

294
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:23,244
Hope you like green.

295
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:26,247
You're in luck.

296
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,032
Get under the fucking...

297
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:49,236
Everything in the bag right
now or I'll fucking kill you!

298
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:52,806
All the fucking cash!
Let's go!

299
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:56,243
Don't fucking look at her.

300
00:27:58,145 --> 00:27:59,346
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

301
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:02,381
Now the fucking safe.
The fucking safe.

302
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:04,816
- It's on a timer.
- Bullshit! It's not on fucking timer!

303
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:06,385
This isn't 7-Eleven.
Open the fucking safe

304
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:08,022
before I crack
your fucking skull!

305
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:10,222
Go!

306
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,960
- Jesus, fuck!
- You look so scared.

307
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:16,862
You are a stupid motherfucker.

308
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:18,332
How we looking
out there, baby doll?

309
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,235
Yeah, we're good, baby.

310
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,368
Hey! Hey!

311
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,872
What the fuck
are you staring at?

312
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,441
You may think
I'm sweet and innocent,

313
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:31,810
but you better finish
putting the goddamn money

314
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:33,111
in the motherfucking bag,

315
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:35,414
or the last thing
you'll ever remember

316
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:38,450
is just how wrong you were.

317
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:41,121
- Move, bitch!
- Fuck, yeah! Let's go!

318
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,089
Cell phone.

319
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:45,893
- Give me your fucking cell phone!
- Okay, okay.

320
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:50,030
Baby doll, get the car ready.

321
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:55,202
Get on
the fucking floor, now!

322
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:09,081
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

323
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,517
- Holy shit!
- Whoo!

324
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,521
Baby, how much money do you
think is in this fucking bag?

325
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:17,557
Oh, my good Lord, babe!

326
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:23,764
Whoo!

327
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:36,277
Dead presidents, motherfucker!

328
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:38,112
Whoa!

329
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:16,050
I love you to pieces,
Dean Taylor.

330
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,044
The way I figure it,
we got about 2,000 miles to cover,

331
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:48,449
and gas is gonna
run us about, uh...

332
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:52,417
Hey!

333
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:54,152
- Listening?
- Yeah.

334
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:56,488
Sorry, my phone's been
blowing up all morning.

335
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,524
Why?

336
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,861
- <i>Now the fucking safe...</i>
- How?

337
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,596
God, what?

338
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:04,797
I posted it.

339
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,201
You posted... Why...
Why the fuck would you post that?

340
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:11,336
Bec... Because I thought
it would be something

341
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:14,373
people wanna see,
and they do.

342
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:17,510
So I took some other photos,
too, of the money and stuff.

343
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:20,145
They're cool. And I created a new account.

344
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:23,350
Last night, zero followers.
This morning...

345
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:27,620
three thousand followers.

346
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:30,623
Three thousand people...

347
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:33,559
- uh, like what we do.
- People are watching that shit?

348
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:37,496
Yes! They... Look...
They're liking, they're sharing it.

349
00:31:37,498 --> 00:31:39,433
There's a few pretty
fine comments.

350
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:45,038
I don't get it.

351
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:48,440
Baby...

352
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:50,077
something like this...

353
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:52,612
- could make us famous.
- No.

354
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:55,414
You can't go posting about
our exploits on the Internet,

355
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,349
'cause the cops are gonna
fucking figure us out, Arielle.

356
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,652
No. I am not gonna
get us caught, okay?

357
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:01,521
I have an IP blocker. Easy.

358
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:03,121
I'll never show our faces.

359
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:06,258
Look, fame equals money,

360
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,293
equals getting out of this
shitty, fucked-up town,

361
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:10,030
which is what we're
trying to do anyway.

362
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:12,399
Dean...

363
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,437
I told you I wanted
to be famous.

364
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:20,673
And nobody cares
about, like...

365
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:23,944
some random girl
from the Redneck Riviera, okay?

366
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:27,212
Now, a couple of teenagers

367
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:29,515
robbing their way
across America,

368
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:32,186
that's worth following.

369
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:39,226
I don't know.

370
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:43,061
Feels like an easy way
to get ourselves arrested.

371
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:44,431
I already said...

372
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,568
I'm not showing our faces.

373
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,341
Well, like I was saying...

374
00:32:56,376 --> 00:32:58,276
we're gonna need
more money, all right?

375
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:00,045
We're almost out of
what we got last night,

376
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:01,982
and liquor stores
are paying shit.

377
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:04,985
- So?
- Well...

378
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,919
I was thinking...

379
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:09,421
when I was in prison,
they brought in this guy named Chester.

380
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:12,725
It turns out he was arrested for
trying to rip off a dispensary.

381
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:16,194
- Like, stealing weed?
- No.

382
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:18,698
That's the thing he was
going for, the money.

383
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,131
So, I looked into it,

384
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:23,368
and apparently dispensaries are
having trouble getting bank accounts.

385
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,303
Credit card companies don't
wanna handle their transactions,

386
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:27,707
- so it's...
- Cash.

387
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:29,742
Yes, and lots of it.

388
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:32,244
Plus, the way I see it,
security is light,

389
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:36,116
and local police and FBI aren't gonna give a
fuck about a weed store getting ripped off.

390
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,316
Okay.

391
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:40,185
Okay, I like it.

392
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:41,656
I like it, but...

393
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,524
I ain't no getaway driver.

394
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:49,229
Baby needs a gun.

395
00:33:57,204 --> 00:34:00,338
It can't be this easy.

396
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,542
How do you think I got mine?

397
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:05,613
Private gun sales in Florida
don't require a background check.

398
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:09,517
We just gotta find
the right one.

399
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:19,426
Boom.

400
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:23,163
Ooh, yeah, Mommy like it.

401
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:25,432
Gotta love America.

402
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,345
Do you feel it?

403
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:42,082
Feel what?

404
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,518
The power.

405
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,689
Like, knowing what
we did last night...

406
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,592
and, uh...

407
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:53,360
we could do anything.

408
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:55,661
Like...

409
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:57,797
Realistically, we could rob

410
00:34:57,799 --> 00:35:02,870
anyone on this beach and turn them
all into whimpering little bitches.

411
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:10,477
I know that it was just last night,
but, like, it really feels...

412
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:13,278
like a long time ago.

413
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,747
In a weird way.

414
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:17,850
I just keep thinking
about how all...

415
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:23,421
my friends, like,
woke up this morning and went to school

416
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:26,692
and did uh, the same shit
that they usually do.

417
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:29,697
And it's just
all the same, but...

418
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:34,602
now it's all gone, and it's so weird.

419
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:38,740
Now it's just
you and me, baby.

420
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:52,787
God, those lips.

421
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:04,832
Ooh. Look, babe,
we're going up followers.

422
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:11,671
Oh. Shit.

423
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:13,574
Baby, the gun guy, he...
He agreed.

424
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:17,677
Fuck, yeah.

425
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,746
Can we do it?

426
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:21,246
Let's go get some money.

427
00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:29,557
All right.

428
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:31,524
Your turn.

429
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:32,825
What?

430
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,194
You wanna do this?

431
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:37,264
Whoa!

432
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:40,233
Let me taste
those lips first.

433
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,308
All yours.

434
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:56,216
Can you do me
the honors?

435
00:36:56,718 --> 00:36:57,852
Fuck, I'll try.

436
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,591
Okay.

437
00:37:15,737 --> 00:37:16,938
Uh...

438
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:20,039
Now I'm feeling kinda nervous.

439
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:22,476
That's okay.
You'll be fine.

440
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:26,645
And I just ask him
where the safe is, right?

441
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:27,949
That's where
all the money is.

442
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:37,690
Hands up, you piece of shit!

443
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:38,591
Hands up!

444
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:40,659
That's right.
Hey, I've got a question.

445
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:42,661
- You got a safe?
- Yeah, it's in the back.

446
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:45,497
- Okay, show it to me. Show it to me.
- Fuck, Yes.

447
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:47,900
Yeah, stop looking at
him, you fucking idiot, all right?

448
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:49,568
Eyes on the prize.

449
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,773
Let's go.
Let's go!

450
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,810
- But I don't know the combo.
- What?

451
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:58,944
What, he...

452
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:01,080
- He doesn't know the combo.
- He's fucking lying.

453
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:04,950
Get down. Get fucking down.

454
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,020
Please, man.

455
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:09,655
Hey, you think I'm an idiot?
Hmm?

456
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:10,956
You think I'm illiterate?

457
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:13,726
You think that I don't know
that you know the fucking combo?

458
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:16,361
Put in the fucking combo, now!

459
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:18,831
Don't wanna
fucking mess with her, man.

460
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,001
That's right.

461
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,369
Come on, faster. Faster.

462
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,908
What's taking you
so damn long?

463
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:33,045
Oh, what, you wanna die
alone a little pussy virgin?

464
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:35,413
Because of a
couple hundred bucks?

465
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:37,382
Wow! I mean, be my guest.

466
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:39,752
Be my fucking guest
and open the goddam safe!

467
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,620
Now!

468
00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:43,622
Good. Let's put it in.

469
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:45,090
Let's go.

470
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:46,861
- Let's go.
- Quick, quick.

471
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:50,461
Looks good, babe.

472
00:38:50,463 --> 00:38:52,600
- Don't forget the phone.
- All right, all right.

473
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:55,102
Cell phone.

474
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:57,705
On the floor.

475
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:01,474
Watch it.

476
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:05,410
Oh! Oh, my God!

477
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:07,847
Okay, that's it.

478
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,516
Fuck, yeah!

479
00:39:10,518 --> 00:39:11,586
Oh, my God.

480
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,791
Baby!

481
00:39:25,465 --> 00:39:26,534
Skittles?

482
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:33,839
I put a few rounds
through her.

483
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:35,708
She's all right.

484
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,876
Trigger pull?

485
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:39,044
Uh, about five pounds.

486
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,682
It's got a nice load
on it, too. Sticks up fine.

487
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,283
Magazines?

488
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:47,955
I got two in addition to the
one that's currently in the gun.

489
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:51,926
What do you think, baby?
You like it?

490
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:53,594
Yep.

491
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:55,428
You like it?

492
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:00,465
Freeze.
Yeah!

493
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:02,402
- You want her?
- Yes, sir.

494
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,536
Hands up, motherfucker!

495
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:05,771
Get on the fucking ground!

496
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,640
Get on the fucking ground
right now!

497
00:40:07,642 --> 00:40:09,442
You got it,
.45 and nine.

498
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:16,414
You know
that shit's good, man.

499
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,051
Ooh, yeah, baby,
let's haul with this gun.

500
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:21,055
Some magazines up here.

501
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:23,856
You know...

502
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:26,560
anyone comes, asks you about this
gun, what are you gonna say?

503
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:32,965
Well...

504
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,636
Tell them that the Bay State florist
is none of your goddamn business.

505
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:41,108
Let's go, babe.

506
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:46,013
Goddamn, I'm gonna miss...

507
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:48,649
Let's go have some fun.

508
00:40:49,984 --> 00:40:52,584
That sounds like
one fine idea, baby.

509
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:57,122
Whoo!

510
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:25,811
Well, the universe answered.

511
00:42:25,813 --> 00:42:29,314
<i>The videos captured during
the robberies and uploaded to social media</i>

512
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:32,251
<i>are the work of Arielle
Summers and Dean Taylor,</i>

513
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:34,319
<i>a Florida couple
wanted in connection</i>

514
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:37,790
<i>with a slate of dispensary
robberies across the South.</i>

515
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:39,658
<i>They're also wanted
for questioning</i>

516
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,293
<i>in the death of
Taylor's father.</i>

517
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:44,930
<i>The couple, followed by millions
of people on social media,</i>

518
00:42:44,932 --> 00:42:48,002
<i>have been called a
modern-day Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

519
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:51,103
Arielle, this is
not fucking good.

520
00:42:51,105 --> 00:42:53,607
They have our names and they
have our pictures. We are fucked.

521
00:42:55,076 --> 00:42:56,277
We're not fucked.

522
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:57,943
We're famous.

523
00:42:57,945 --> 00:42:59,711
Are you fucking kidding me?

524
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:02,181
Do you not see this is
a big, big fucking problem?

525
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:04,383
There's a lot of land
between us and Hollywood,

526
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:06,385
which means a lot of
fucking cops to avoid,

527
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:09,088
so your social media game
is fucking over.

528
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,291
- Dean.
- Look, I told you to be careful, okay?

529
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:13,926
Not get us fucking caught.

530
00:43:13,928 --> 00:43:15,994
Baby, the videos didn't
get us caught,

531
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:17,996
the robberies did.

532
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:20,232
And they were gonna
figure that out eventually.

533
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:23,836
The video is just...
confirming.

534
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:25,671
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just fucking evidence for them.

535
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:27,706
Also, now they have everything
that they fucking need.

536
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:30,744
Which is irrelevant
if we don't get arrested.

537
00:43:31,846 --> 00:43:34,813
How the fuck
do you think this ends?

538
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:36,982
You think being, uh,
famous for this fucking shit

539
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:38,652
is just gonna absolve you
of the crime?

540
00:43:39,987 --> 00:43:42,788
How many celebrities
have you seen get off easy?

541
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,192
It's not gonna fucking
work like that, all right?

542
00:43:46,694 --> 00:43:47,695
Okay.

543
00:43:51,365 --> 00:43:53,332
Plus, I already told you
what I wanted.

544
00:43:53,334 --> 00:43:54,802
Yeah, and I told you.

545
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:02,276
You fucking kidding me?

546
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:06,345
Fuck.

547
00:44:06,347 --> 00:44:07,815
We can outrun him.

548
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:10,349
Speed up.

549
00:44:12,086 --> 00:44:13,154
Baby, speed up.

550
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,421
No.

551
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,097
Just shut up.

552
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:27,833
You better watch
your fucking mouth.

553
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,103
Don't start nothin'.

554
00:44:34,808 --> 00:44:38,045
Is there a problem,
Officer?

555
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:42,917
License and registration.

556
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,287
Um, I'm sorry, Officer,

557
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:50,956
we... We're just
a little bit lost.

558
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:52,357
You see, we're, um...

559
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:53,992
We're road-tripping
up to Austin,

560
00:44:53,994 --> 00:44:57,396
uh, to...
To see my mama, and...

561
00:44:57,398 --> 00:45:01,400
Funny, I... I don't know why we
can't seems to find it.

562
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:02,834
You know how fast
you were going?

563
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:04,836
Oh, that's...
That's my bad.

564
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:08,040
Actually, I, uh...
I do love to go fast.

565
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:12,878
My... My boyfriend here loves to
indulge me from time to time.

566
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,783
Uh, we just didn't think we
would hurt anybody out this late.

567
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:18,219
Just stay in the car.

568
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:23,991
He's gonna fucking
figure it out.

569
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:29,394
Oh...

570
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:30,896
- God!
- Arielle, wait.

571
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:33,865
No. Um, excuse me, Officer.

572
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:36,068
I know we were
driving a little fast...

573
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,035
Miss, get back
in the vehicle.

574
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:38,971
We're just gonna try
and be on our way now.

575
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:40,138
Miss you need to get
back in the vehicle.

576
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,040
Fuck!

577
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:44,076
- Get back in the car now.
- Officer, she just had a bad day.

578
00:45:44,078 --> 00:45:45,545
Let's us just
get out of here.

579
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:47,813
Sir, I need you to get back
in your vehicle right now.

580
00:45:47,815 --> 00:45:50,282
- I have every right...
- Arielle, shut the fuck up!

581
00:45:50,284 --> 00:45:52,284
I told you to fucking
watch your mouth!

582
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:55,087
Both of you, get in
your vehicle right now!

583
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:56,824
Officer, please. We can...

584
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:01,661
- Get down.
- Whoa...

585
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:03,829
Get on the ground, both of you, now.
On the ground.

586
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:05,364
Okay.

587
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:08,300
Hands on your head!
Hands on your head!

588
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:10,304
- Officer, let's just...
- Shut up.

589
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:11,839
Fuck.

590
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,208
Dispatch...

591
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:28,420
- Uh...
- Fuck.

592
00:46:28,422 --> 00:46:29,758
Okay, okay.

593
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:32,359
Okay. Okay.

594
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:35,996
We should leave.

595
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:38,897
We should fucking leave.

596
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:40,034
Dean, get in the car.

597
00:46:41,235 --> 00:46:43,571
Dean, get in the fucking
car, now! God!

598
00:46:46,073 --> 00:46:47,074
Go.

599
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:44,431
Can I help you?

600
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:48,603
Hello. Miss?

601
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:53,040
Do you need some help
with something?

602
00:47:53,941 --> 00:47:56,341
No. Uh, I'm all right.

603
00:47:56,343 --> 00:47:59,179
You sure? You've just been staring
off there for the last few minutes.

604
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:43,410
<i>When are we
gonna leave here?</i>

605
00:50:57,124 --> 00:50:59,259
- Baby?
- I don't know.

606
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:03,565
Well...

607
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,135
I'm gonna have to post
something soon.

608
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:26,251
<i>'Cause fans are
leaving comments, angry ones,</i>

609
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:29,356
<i>and we're losing followers.
That's not good.</i>

610
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:34,161
I don't fucking care. They're not
the ones facing the death penalty.

611
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:35,630
Well...

612
00:51:36,598 --> 00:51:38,265
we can't stay here forever.

613
00:51:39,366 --> 00:51:41,569
<i>You promised me
Hollywood, baby.</i>

614
00:51:44,772 --> 00:51:46,406
Arielle, you killed
a fucking cop.

615
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:51,611
You understand that?

616
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:53,246
Do you know what
that fucking means?

617
00:51:56,818 --> 00:51:58,818
You wanna talk to me
like I'm fucking illiterate?

618
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,120
I know what I did.

619
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:04,456
I mean, you know that killing
people, much less fucking cops,

620
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:05,526
was not part of the plan.

621
00:52:21,643 --> 00:52:23,909
Well, you'd be
in jail right now.

622
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:25,878
No, we'd be in jail.

623
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,279
And you don't know that, 'cause we
could have fuckin' knocked him out

624
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:29,280
or done something else.

625
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:30,750
<i>He had
a fucking gun on you.</i>

626
00:52:30,752 --> 00:52:32,217
<i>What... What was
I supposed to do,</i>

627
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:34,120
<i>just wait around
and see what happens?</i>

628
00:52:34,122 --> 00:52:37,523
<i>I don't fuckin' know, but killing that
cop has landed us in a world of fucking shit.</i>

629
00:52:37,525 --> 00:52:39,527
I did that for us, baby.

630
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:42,662
I love you.

631
00:52:42,664 --> 00:52:45,564
And... And I want us to
always be together.

632
00:52:45,566 --> 00:52:47,800
Of course I'm not gonna
let you go back to jail.

633
00:52:47,802 --> 00:52:49,702
Arielle, shut the fuck up.
You did that for you

634
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:52,439
or whatever bullshit fucking
fame game you're chasing.

635
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,182
We're staying put
till I say so.

636
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:12,225
You better fucking say so 'cause
I ain't meant to be no housewife.

637
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,440
The world needs us.

638
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:29,342
The world needs you.

639
00:53:30,912 --> 00:53:32,945
Hands up,
you stupid little bitch!

640
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:36,314
That's right. You're gonna listen to
me, okay, because if you don't,

641
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:38,517
oh, I don't know,
it could be your last day.

642
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:40,621
Do you even know
how to use that, little lady?

643
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,589
Oh, shit!

644
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:45,725
Now you're gonna
listen to me good.

645
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:49,731
You're gonna put all the money
from the register in there, now.

646
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,800
Go on. Come on,
I don't got all fucking day.

647
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:56,003
You're her, aren't you?

648
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:01,040
- I knew it. I knew that it was you the other day.
- Faster! Come on, bitch!

649
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:04,577
You were just standing over
there, staring off into space.

650
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:06,379
And now you're in
over your head.

651
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:11,418
Dave.

652
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:18,793
Shit! Shit!

653
00:54:31,506 --> 00:54:33,574
No, motherfuck...

654
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:35,440
Fuck!

655
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:37,512
Fuck!

656
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,283
Fuck you!

657
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,723
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

658
00:54:50,024 --> 00:54:51,926
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

659
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,836
Dean. Dean, I fucked up!

660
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:06,005
- What?
- I fucked up. We gotta go.

661
00:55:06,007 --> 00:55:08,007
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck happened to your arm?

662
00:55:08,009 --> 00:55:10,976
- I got shot.
- You got fucking shot?

663
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:12,678
We gotta wrap that right now.

664
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,746
Come here.

665
00:55:13,748 --> 00:55:15,714
- What the fuck did you do?
- He saw me. He saw me.

666
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:18,851
- Who?
- He recognized the car. He knew it was me.

667
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:21,587
- We need to fucking go.
- What the fuck happened?

668
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,558
What the fuck.

669
00:55:25,693 --> 00:55:27,827
I tried to...
To rip off this...

670
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:30,563
The moron on
Highway 2, right, and...

671
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:33,566
The guy... This guy walked in,
so I got distracted, and the clerk...

672
00:55:33,568 --> 00:55:35,000
Fucking Christ!
Why would you do that?

673
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,467
We have enough fuckin' money!

674
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:38,504
This is not about
the fucking money, Dean!

675
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:39,841
Obviously.

676
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:44,109
But you know,
he saw me before, and...

677
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:47,680
And he recognized me.

678
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:51,116
And so, maybe this time he
won't actually call the cops.

679
00:55:51,118 --> 00:55:52,718
Are you fucking nuts?

680
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,119
Don't you call me
fucking nuts!

681
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:56,421
There's a huge fucking
rewards on our heads!

682
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:58,691
You don't think he's gonna
fucking cash in on that?

683
00:55:58,693 --> 00:56:00,995
Let's get the fuck out of here
before they set up road blocks!

684
00:56:14,542 --> 00:56:16,441
All right, get in the back
and stay down.

685
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:19,446
Fuck!

686
00:56:43,671 --> 00:56:46,138
Fuck. This is bleeding a lot.

687
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,009
- Like, a lot.
- Fuck!

688
00:56:50,978 --> 00:56:52,146
Hold on.

689
00:56:57,985 --> 00:57:00,621
- I'm gonna need your help, babe.
- Okay.

690
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,128
Okay.

691
00:57:08,996 --> 00:57:11,964
Ahhh! Okay, I can't hold it
for long.

692
00:57:11,966 --> 00:57:13,599
Not yet.

693
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:16,604
- Dean, tell me when.
- Now!

694
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:26,847
Get 'em, baby!

695
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:30,851
Oh, shit.

696
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,893
Well, the whole fucking state
of Texas knows we're here.

697
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,166
Oh, my God.

698
00:57:47,168 --> 00:57:49,568
It's starting to burn.
What do I do?

699
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,137
Jesus, uh, there's gotta be
something in one of the bags.

700
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:53,772
Gauze or whatever.

701
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:54,875
Okay.

702
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:02,014
Where did you put the bag?

703
00:58:02,016 --> 00:58:03,782
What bag?

704
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,585
The bag with all
the fucking money in it.

705
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:08,153
I thought that
you grabbed it.

706
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:10,089
No! I thought
you grabbed it!

707
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:12,825
I got the bag
with the fucking guns!

708
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:14,729
- Check again!
- Oh, shit.

709
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,763
I think I fucking see it.

710
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:19,665
It's a huge duffel bag
filled with money,

711
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,867
and I think it's hiding in
the goddamn glove compartment.

712
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:23,869
Jesus fucking Christ!

713
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,704
We gotta go back.

714
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:28,874
We can't go back. Are you crazy?
There's cops everywhere.

715
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:31,877
Arielle, that money was
everything that we fuckin' had!

716
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:35,249
Well, you shouldn't have fucking
rushed me out of the house!

717
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:36,884
Fuck!

718
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:49,995
Ow, fuck! Babe, watch it.

719
00:58:49,997 --> 00:58:52,299
Oh, my God.

720
00:58:55,002 --> 00:58:57,903
Mmm, this hurts so much more
than I thought it would.

721
00:58:57,905 --> 00:58:59,905
Yeah.

722
00:58:59,907 --> 00:59:02,943
- That's getting shot.
- Yeah, I know.

723
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:08,716
You ever been shot?

724
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:11,218
No.

725
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:17,089
Well, then, baby,
I guess I got you beat.

726
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:23,197
- There.
- Thanks.

727
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:26,799
Oh. Okay, wait.

728
00:59:26,801 --> 00:59:28,736
Real quick,
take a photo of me.

729
00:59:30,938 --> 00:59:32,940
You're fucking unbelievable.

730
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:35,342
What?

731
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:39,313
Okay, I'll take it myself.

732
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:49,590
What's your problem?

733
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:51,723
My problem?

734
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:55,160
You're taking a picture of
your fucking gunshot wound.

735
00:59:55,162 --> 00:59:57,362
So? You know how many
likes this is gonna get?

736
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:59,700
Who fucking cares
about likes?

737
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:02,903
I do.

738
01:00:04,038 --> 01:00:05,771
This ain't worth it.

739
01:00:05,773 --> 01:00:07,372
You don't fucking get it.

740
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:10,010
- You don't fucking get it.
- Guess not.

741
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:13,178
Hey.

742
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:18,317
Hey, why is this so hard
for you to understand, huh?

743
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,688
What don't you get
about this?

744
01:00:21,222 --> 01:00:22,688
Why can't you see it?

745
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:23,822
I guess I can't see it

746
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:25,824
'cause I'm not on my
fucking phone all the time.

747
01:00:25,826 --> 01:00:28,694
You don't know
what this could do for us.

748
01:00:28,696 --> 01:00:30,295
- For us?
- Yeah.

749
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:32,931
For us? This hasn't brought us
anything but fucking trouble!

750
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:35,801
You and your fuckin' followers or
whatever the fuck you call it...

751
01:00:35,803 --> 01:00:38,203
I don't even know
what the fuck it is anymore.

752
01:00:38,205 --> 01:00:41,406
Look. We are on a road heading
straight for a cliff, and it scares me

753
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:43,775
that you're too fuckin' dumb
to see that!

754
01:00:43,777 --> 01:00:47,813
The universe put us here
for a reason!

755
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:49,982
- I don't know what that reason is, but the univ...
- Yeah. The universe...

756
01:00:49,984 --> 01:00:52,050
Did the... Did the fucking
universe get you shot?

757
01:00:52,052 --> 01:00:54,319
- Yes.
- Did the fucking universe make you kill that cop?

758
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:56,955
Fuck your universe!
Fuck your fate and all that shit!

759
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:59,124
What has it
fucking done for me, huh?

760
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:00,893
Nothing.

761
01:01:00,895 --> 01:01:03,795
I didn't make you
come with me.

762
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:05,199
No? What about my dad?

763
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:09,768
What...
What about your dad?

764
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:12,004
- He was a piece of shit.
- That's besides the point.

765
01:01:12,006 --> 01:01:13,272
I could not
fucking stay there.

766
01:01:13,274 --> 01:01:15,075
You fuckin' put this on me.

767
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:19,011
- I was trying to help you.
- Yeah?

768
01:01:19,013 --> 01:01:21,780
It's not my fault you're a pussy
who can't stand up for himself.

769
01:01:21,782 --> 01:01:22,983
Well, fuck your help!

770
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:24,885
Fuck your fame!

771
01:01:28,923 --> 01:01:30,222
Don't you fuckin'...

772
01:01:30,224 --> 01:01:31,290
- I said...
- Try me!

773
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:32,758
Fucking try me, Dean!

774
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,094
Huh? Huh?

775
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,066
We're not gonna stop.

776
01:02:15,302 --> 01:02:17,404
Yeah. I know.

777
01:02:23,811 --> 01:02:25,112
We need money.

778
01:02:28,015 --> 01:02:30,849
I got a buddy
up in Oklahoma City.

779
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:33,153
Kyle. I met him while
I was in prison in Florida.

780
01:02:34,955 --> 01:02:37,124
Told me to look him up
if I was ever in town.

781
01:02:37,992 --> 01:02:38,993
Mmm.

782
01:02:40,094 --> 01:02:42,327
Maybe he can
find us something.

783
01:02:42,329 --> 01:02:43,964
It's out of our way, though.

784
01:02:45,065 --> 01:02:46,133
Mmm.

785
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:52,873
They've made sure every county
in the state knows we're here.

786
01:02:54,308 --> 01:02:56,977
We gotta ditch this car and
find somewhere to hide.

787
01:02:59,346 --> 01:03:01,179
Get the fuck out of Texas.

788
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:36,214
- Hi.
- Hello.

789
01:03:36,216 --> 01:03:37,449
You need help?

790
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:39,117
Oh, good Lord,
you're a lifesaver.

791
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,319
I am at death's door
over here.

792
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:43,523
Yeah, my... My car is all jacked
up, and my phone died.

793
01:03:43,525 --> 01:03:45,123
Well, I can give you a lift.

794
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,659
Oh, great.

795
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:51,196
Um, random question. You... You don't
got a boyfriend or a roommate or...

796
01:03:51,198 --> 01:03:54,066
Or a girlfriend. I mean,
I don't wanna assume,

797
01:03:54,068 --> 01:03:55,469
at home or anything,
do you?

798
01:03:56,403 --> 01:03:58,470
Uh...

799
01:03:58,472 --> 01:04:00,372
- No. Why?
- Oh!

800
01:04:00,374 --> 01:04:03,578
Great, 'cause I was wondering
if I could stay for a night.

801
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:06,146
With him.

802
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:17,322
Yes, no, maybe so?

803
01:04:17,324 --> 01:04:19,592
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah?

804
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:21,261
Great! Come on, baby.

805
01:04:54,328 --> 01:04:56,330
You don't have to keep
that thing out.

806
01:05:01,402 --> 01:05:05,705
You know, there's only one person
in the whole world that I trust.

807
01:05:05,707 --> 01:05:07,374
He's right there.

808
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:12,079
I know who you are.

809
01:05:14,081 --> 01:05:15,213
What?

810
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:16,216
I mean...

811
01:05:16,718 --> 01:05:18,586
I follow you online.

812
01:05:19,453 --> 01:05:21,589
I knew who you were
when I pulled up.

813
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:27,159
No shit.

814
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,631
But you...
You pulled up anyway.

815
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:34,602
Yeah, I guess.

816
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,118
They said that, um...

817
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:53,721
you killed a cop?

818
01:05:57,157 --> 01:05:58,593
Yeah, well...

819
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:09,369
sometimes you gotta
protect the shit you love.

820
01:06:35,462 --> 01:06:37,630
You don't got any beer?

821
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:40,200
Uh, I don't really drink.

822
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:42,568
Vodka?

823
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:45,507
I mean, every chick's got a
bottle of vodka in her freezer.

824
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:47,140
Sorry.

825
01:06:48,408 --> 01:06:50,043
Well, at least you got food.

826
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:57,315
<i>Authorities are
revealing that the couple was living</i>

827
01:06:57,317 --> 01:06:58,483
<i>in a foreclosed development</i>

828
01:06:58,485 --> 01:06:59,952
<i>for what could have been weeks.</i>

829
01:06:59,954 --> 01:07:04,356
<i>They made regular trips to local
convenience and grocery stores.</i>

830
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:07,459
<i>We are also told a bag
was found inside the house</i>

831
01:07:07,461 --> 01:07:10,195
<i>containing very large
sums of money.</i>

832
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:13,231
<i>Money allegedly obtained
from the many robberies</i>

833
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:16,101
<i>the couple staged
across the Southland.</i>

834
01:07:16,103 --> 01:07:18,169
<i>Authorities believe,
in the rush to leave,</i>

835
01:07:18,171 --> 01:07:21,172
<i>it may have accidentally
been left behind.</i>

836
01:07:21,174 --> 01:07:23,776
<i>Police are now worried
that low on funds,</i>

837
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:26,646
<i>the couple could attempt
additional robberies.</i>

838
01:07:26,648 --> 01:07:29,347
<i>After this morning's fatal
shootout with the police,</i>

839
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:32,284
<i>they're believed to be armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

840
01:07:32,286 --> 01:07:34,352
Oh, wow.

841
01:07:34,354 --> 01:07:37,222
Now we're extremely
dangerous, Dean.

842
01:07:37,224 --> 01:07:39,326
Oh, we're really
getting up there.

843
01:07:43,598 --> 01:07:45,332
Do you think we're dangerous?

844
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,133
Um...

845
01:07:48,135 --> 01:07:49,537
I don't know,
y'all seem nice.

846
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:56,376
You got Wi-Fi?

847
01:07:57,444 --> 01:07:59,344
Yeah. The, um,

848
01:07:59,346 --> 01:08:01,816
networking password
is on the fridge.

849
01:08:05,687 --> 01:08:07,087
Can I smoke?

850
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:22,334
Arielle tells me
that you're, uh, a fan or...

851
01:08:22,336 --> 01:08:24,237
follower, or whatever
the fuck you want to call it.

852
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:26,741
Mmm. Yeah, I guess so.

853
01:08:27,474 --> 01:08:28,475
Mmm.

854
01:08:29,077 --> 01:08:30,645
Never met a fan before.

855
01:08:32,245 --> 01:08:33,681
Let me ask you something.

856
01:08:34,682 --> 01:08:36,383
Why do you follow us?

857
01:08:42,222 --> 01:08:43,591
Um...

858
01:08:46,928 --> 01:08:48,228
Okay, I...

859
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,565
I feel like there is...

860
01:08:52,533 --> 01:08:54,535
very little I can change...

861
01:08:55,803 --> 01:08:58,303
You know, I work for
a telemarketing firm.

862
01:08:58,305 --> 01:09:02,541
You know, you get a call about
a special offer during dinner.

863
01:09:02,543 --> 01:09:03,711
That's me.

864
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:09,784
I studied art in college.

865
01:09:11,886 --> 01:09:14,720
Couldn't get a job doing that.

866
01:09:14,722 --> 01:09:18,958
And now they're talking
about closing the firm

867
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,863
and moving it overseas
because it's cheaper.

868
01:09:23,731 --> 01:09:25,465
And I have student loans.

869
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,304
I don't know...

870
01:09:33,007 --> 01:09:34,374
I just...

871
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:36,811
feel like I'm stuck.

872
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:41,949
And then there's you guys.

873
01:09:43,951 --> 01:09:46,587
You stopped taking it
and started giving it.

874
01:09:47,989 --> 01:09:50,223
I think people
find that exciting...

875
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:52,827
empowering.

876
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:03,270
I think people...

877
01:10:04,038 --> 01:10:05,873
are just looking to waste time.

878
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:08,375
And we're it.

879
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:13,715
You know, it's' just, uh...

880
01:10:14,148 --> 01:10:15,650
It's a fantasy.

881
01:10:16,416 --> 01:10:17,885
Everything about it.

882
01:10:21,556 --> 01:10:23,488
I mean, it ain't
no way to live.

883
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,392
I don't care
who the fuck you are.

884
01:10:28,062 --> 01:10:29,764
You're luckier
than you think.

885
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:36,635
It doesn't really matter.

886
01:10:36,637 --> 01:10:39,272
Um, can I
go to the bathroom?

887
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:20,782
I see something up ahead.

888
01:11:22,884 --> 01:11:24,284
Here we go.

889
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:35,863
Get ready, baby!

890
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:01,022
Relax.

891
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,390
It's cool.

892
01:12:25,112 --> 01:12:27,146
Morning, ma'am.

893
01:12:27,148 --> 01:12:29,050
Can we have you two
step out the car?

894
01:12:39,627 --> 01:12:41,426
Everything all right, troopers?

895
01:12:41,428 --> 01:12:44,565
You boys sure are carrying
a lot of firepower.

896
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:48,035
Where you all headed today?

897
01:12:48,603 --> 01:12:50,836
Um, OSU.

898
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:51,839
Just getting back
from break.

899
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,841
ID?

900
01:13:01,481 --> 01:13:02,817
- And you?
- What?

901
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:06,085
ID.

902
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:07,588
I ain't driving.

903
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:10,124
You don't have an ID?

904
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:15,527
Like I said, I ain't driving.

905
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:17,196
Uh, yeah, funny story, actually.

906
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:21,033
I, uh, left my ID
in... In my dorm,

907
01:13:21,035 --> 01:13:23,771
and that's why I've got my, uh,
sister here driving me back.

908
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:26,874
She's your sister?

909
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:30,142
Um, sorority sister.

910
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:31,145
Hmm.

911
01:13:33,514 --> 01:13:35,014
We'd like for you
to open the trunk.

912
01:13:35,016 --> 01:13:36,751
Don't you need a warrant
or something?

913
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:40,185
You law students?

914
01:13:40,187 --> 01:13:42,187
Year one. I don't know,
maybe I'm just itching

915
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:43,858
for some extra credit.

916
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,926
Well, you're right.

917
01:13:46,928 --> 01:13:49,662
We either need a warrant
or your permission.

918
01:13:49,664 --> 01:13:51,964
Now, we'd like for you
to be on your way.

919
01:13:51,966 --> 01:13:55,000
But if you'd rather wait while we get
a warrant and tear this car apart...

920
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:56,101
- No.
- ...we can do that.

921
01:13:56,103 --> 01:13:57,838
It's fine. It's fine.

922
01:14:11,852 --> 01:14:13,187
See anything you like?

923
01:14:19,694 --> 01:14:22,061
Thank you, ma'am,
for your cooperation.

924
01:14:22,063 --> 01:14:24,029
You ride safe.

925
01:14:24,031 --> 01:14:26,000
Well, you troopers
have a nice day, now.

926
01:15:04,839 --> 01:15:08,607
Jesus Christ,
it's hot as fuck in there.

927
01:15:08,609 --> 01:15:11,579
Welcome to Oklahoma, baby.

928
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:20,955
End of the line, darling.

929
01:15:22,857 --> 01:15:23,891
What are you gonna do to me?

930
01:15:25,159 --> 01:15:26,692
Mmm.

931
01:15:26,694 --> 01:15:29,094
Well, we gave you
our word. Doesn't that...

932
01:15:29,096 --> 01:15:30,564
Doesn't that count
for something?

933
01:15:49,216 --> 01:15:52,618
So, you saw that gas
station couple of miles back, right?

934
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,753
- Yeah.
- Which way are we headed, if anyone asks?

935
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:55,854
East.

936
01:15:55,856 --> 01:15:59,091
- Attagirl.
- I like 'em smart.

937
01:15:59,093 --> 01:16:01,862
- All right. Baby, can you close the trunk for me?
- Wait.

938
01:16:04,165 --> 01:16:05,733
Maybe I can, um...

939
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:08,167
Maybe I can come with you.

940
01:16:08,169 --> 01:16:10,002
Nope. Nope.
That ain't the deal.

941
01:16:10,004 --> 01:16:12,004
- Well, hold on. Hold on.
- No, no, she's not coming.

942
01:16:12,006 --> 01:16:12,971
Come on,
are you fucking crazy?

943
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:15,276
I mean... I can help.

944
01:16:17,678 --> 01:16:18,679
No.

945
01:16:20,915 --> 01:16:21,916
Elle...

946
01:16:23,217 --> 01:16:27,386
this just isn't your path.
That's the problem.

947
01:16:27,388 --> 01:16:31,957
Now, there's definitely something that
you need to take from this experience.

948
01:16:31,959 --> 01:16:34,960
There is some big change

949
01:16:34,962 --> 01:16:37,362
that Jesus wants you to make.

950
01:16:37,364 --> 01:16:40,801
Coming with us,
I'm sorry, it just ain't it.

951
01:16:42,903 --> 01:16:46,338
Elle, just remember to report
your car stolen.

952
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:48,008
Insurance company
will take care of it, okay?

953
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:50,978
Oh, you know what?

954
01:16:54,181 --> 01:16:55,616
What's your user name?

955
01:16:57,418 --> 01:16:59,218
Bunny Robes 26.

956
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:00,254
That's cute.

957
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:06,959
Oh, that's cute. We're hot.

958
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:08,762
I'd date us. Okay.

959
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:11,997
Oh, and Elle...

960
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:13,734
people are really
gonna wanna

961
01:17:14,702 --> 01:17:16,103
talk to you after this.

962
01:17:18,706 --> 01:17:21,473
Tell them something
worth hearing.

963
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:23,775
Fuck it, tell them whatever you want.
I don't care.

964
01:17:23,777 --> 01:17:25,746
All right. Good day, now.

965
01:17:44,498 --> 01:17:46,000
She could have come with.

966
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,000
Yeah, right.

967
01:17:48,002 --> 01:17:49,837
We would have
gotten that girl killed.

968
01:17:51,405 --> 01:17:53,172
She was nice.

969
01:17:53,174 --> 01:17:55,474
She didn't put up a fuss
or anything.

970
01:17:55,476 --> 01:17:58,412
It's 'cause she's living
in a fuckin' fantasy world.

971
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,279
Where the fuck
is this place?

972
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:09,350
What was this guy doing
in a prison in Florida?

973
01:19:10,484 --> 01:19:14,219
Well, he was rolling
through Miami on a big score.

974
01:19:14,221 --> 01:19:17,990
Day before, some rookie cop
pulls him over...

975
01:19:17,992 --> 01:19:21,195
finds a gun on him and sends
him upstate on a weapons charge.

976
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:24,129
Possession.

977
01:19:24,131 --> 01:19:26,834
In the fucking state of Florida.
Can you believe that?

978
01:19:29,036 --> 01:19:30,037
Brother.

979
01:19:31,472 --> 01:19:33,905
- It's been a minute.
- <i>Hola.</i>

980
01:19:33,907 --> 01:19:37,142
<i>Hola.</i>
This must be the missus.

981
01:19:37,144 --> 01:19:39,579
Arielle, Kyle.
Kyle, Arielle.

982
01:19:39,581 --> 01:19:41,146
- Pleasure.
- Charmed.

983
01:19:41,148 --> 01:19:43,616
Well, get the fuck in here.
Come on.

984
01:19:43,618 --> 01:19:45,851
- I'd love a beer.
- Yeah?

985
01:19:45,853 --> 01:19:47,386
Well, have a seat.

986
01:19:49,524 --> 01:19:51,392
Welcome the fuck home,
you two.

987
01:19:52,893 --> 01:19:55,561
Beer, coming up.

988
01:19:55,563 --> 01:19:57,929
You want any weed,
coke, nothing?

989
01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:02,034
- I like the place.
- Thank you.

990
01:20:02,036 --> 01:20:05,304
We're in the middle
of redecorating.

991
01:20:05,306 --> 01:20:07,239
I was expecting y'all later.

992
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:10,375
Kind of all fucked up at the
moment, but...

993
01:20:10,377 --> 01:20:12,411
Well, little fun to keep your foot to the floor, right?

994
01:20:13,581 --> 01:20:15,215
They sure as shit do.

995
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:18,018
They do.

996
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:22,387
You guys have been busy.

997
01:20:22,389 --> 01:20:26,493
I've been seeing you all over the place
with your little fucking adventures.

998
01:20:28,162 --> 01:20:29,430
Interesting approach.

999
01:20:31,332 --> 01:20:33,298
Being so public about it.

1000
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:36,070
We've got five million
followers now.

1001
01:20:37,104 --> 01:20:40,107
Five million followers.

1002
01:20:40,508 --> 01:20:41,543
Mmm-hmm.

1003
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:46,211
You should ask all of 'em
for a dollar.

1004
01:20:46,213 --> 01:20:48,982
You won't have to rip off
weed dealers.

1005
01:20:51,285 --> 01:20:52,886
Where is the fun in that?

1006
01:20:55,923 --> 01:20:57,858
You got a problem
having fans?

1007
01:20:58,459 --> 01:20:59,460
Mmm.

1008
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,262
Brother, I'm a fan.

1009
01:21:03,297 --> 01:21:05,032
And you got a great eye.

1010
01:21:06,534 --> 01:21:08,402
I'm gonna need you
to do me a favor.

1011
01:21:10,371 --> 01:21:11,905
Keep this place...

1012
01:21:13,107 --> 01:21:15,142
everything in it,
off your little...

1013
01:21:16,377 --> 01:21:17,579
Instagram.

1014
01:21:18,946 --> 01:21:19,980
You feel me?

1015
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:22,950
So...

1016
01:21:24,619 --> 01:21:26,387
how do you guys find robbin'?

1017
01:21:28,055 --> 01:21:30,322
We like it just fine.

1018
01:21:30,324 --> 01:21:34,993
Yeah, I just... I can't get a novel
approach, hitting those dispensaries.

1019
01:21:34,995 --> 01:21:36,596
You have much crowd control
in those places?

1020
01:21:36,598 --> 01:21:38,463
Depends on
the time of day.

1021
01:21:38,465 --> 01:21:40,600
We generally avoid 4:20 p.m.

1022
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:46,340
You need help
with crowd control?

1023
01:21:50,277 --> 01:21:51,945
We got something coming up.

1024
01:21:56,518 --> 01:21:58,553
But I can't have
any loose cannons.

1025
01:22:02,189 --> 01:22:03,658
Well, you ain't gotta
worry about me.

1026
01:22:04,391 --> 01:22:06,759
Is that what
you told the cop?

1027
01:22:06,761 --> 01:22:08,630
"You don't gotta
worry about me"?

1028
01:22:14,368 --> 01:22:16,536
He didn't really
leave me a choice.

1029
01:22:16,538 --> 01:22:19,171
Look, she's good, man,
all right?

1030
01:22:19,173 --> 01:22:21,273
Better than me
most of the time.

1031
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:23,241
What's the deal?

1032
01:22:23,243 --> 01:22:26,213
I need a couple triggermen.
Trigger... women.

1033
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,581
- Whatever.
- Cute.

1034
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:30,048
Its's a big job.

1035
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:31,686
A lot of real estate.

1036
01:22:32,554 --> 01:22:34,087
It's a bank downtown.

1037
01:22:34,556 --> 01:22:35,723
A bank?

1038
01:22:37,424 --> 01:22:38,626
A bank.

1039
01:22:40,093 --> 01:22:42,027
Easy six figures.

1040
01:22:42,029 --> 01:22:43,030
Each.

1041
01:22:44,732 --> 01:22:47,399
I won't even make you two
split it.

1042
01:22:47,401 --> 01:22:49,669
Well, truth is...

1043
01:22:49,671 --> 01:22:52,037
you know, we are short
on good help these days.

1044
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:54,540
And frankly,
anyone who made it through Texas

1045
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:58,076
without a scratch in their ass
is okay in my book.

1046
01:22:58,078 --> 01:23:02,382
But, this ain't some
bullshit, pot-head picnic.

1047
01:23:03,217 --> 01:23:05,052
This is the real deal.

1048
01:23:07,354 --> 01:23:09,589
Think you can handle
an assault rifle?

1049
01:23:09,591 --> 01:23:12,057
I got one in the back of the
truck with my name on it.

1050
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:20,535
<i>I don't like it.</i>

1051
01:23:21,769 --> 01:23:23,803
It's a lot of money.

1052
01:23:23,805 --> 01:23:26,371
More than we ever made
this whole time.

1053
01:23:26,373 --> 01:23:27,773
Well, I thought
you didn't care about money.

1054
01:23:27,775 --> 01:23:30,810
Well, I don't.
Not really, anyway.

1055
01:23:30,812 --> 01:23:33,113
What's wrong?
You don't trust Kyle?

1056
01:23:34,281 --> 01:23:35,282
Do you?

1057
01:23:36,651 --> 01:23:39,217
Big score, less risk.

1058
01:23:39,219 --> 01:23:42,087
You said that.
That's exactly what this is.

1059
01:23:42,089 --> 01:23:43,523
- Banks are different.
- Well, how do you know?

1060
01:23:43,525 --> 01:23:46,692
Because it is fucking common sense.
We have never done this before.

1061
01:23:46,694 --> 01:23:48,694
We have never worked
with Kyle before.

1062
01:23:48,696 --> 01:23:50,228
We don't know what the
fuck we're walking into.

1063
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:52,565
Taking a bank would be huge.

1064
01:23:52,567 --> 01:23:54,534
- Think about what people will...
- This isn't bullshit

1065
01:23:54,536 --> 01:23:55,868
fucking Twitter, Arielle!

1066
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,103
It's not fucking bullshit
to me, Dean!

1067
01:23:58,105 --> 01:23:59,204
Okay?

1068
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:01,373
People care about me.
They care about what I say,

1069
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:02,842
they care about what I
think, and I like that!

1070
01:24:02,844 --> 01:24:04,211
Yeah, what about me? Huh?

1071
01:24:06,213 --> 01:24:07,447
Does that matter to you?

1072
01:24:14,556 --> 01:24:15,557
Hey.

1073
01:24:21,161 --> 01:24:23,295
Let's just go.

1074
01:24:23,297 --> 01:24:25,497
Lets' just fucking get out of here.
We'll go to Mexico. Disappear.

1075
01:24:25,499 --> 01:24:27,600
- I can't. I'm not running from this.
- Why?

1076
01:24:27,602 --> 01:24:29,403
Why? Because of...
Of fate?

1077
01:24:30,672 --> 01:24:32,139
You can choose.

1078
01:24:46,654 --> 01:24:49,154
You know, I've...

1079
01:24:49,156 --> 01:24:51,224
If we do this, we do...
We do the bank...

1080
01:24:53,528 --> 01:24:55,262
will you leave with me after?

1081
01:25:38,606 --> 01:25:39,607
Okay.

1082
01:25:43,578 --> 01:25:44,646
Okay.

1083
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:31,791
What the fuck you doing?

1084
01:26:31,793 --> 01:26:34,361
Fuck Kyle. I'm not missing this.

1085
01:26:43,037 --> 01:26:45,738
Everybody get the fuck down!

1086
01:26:47,374 --> 01:26:48,641
Move! Move!

1087
01:26:54,515 --> 01:26:56,816
Kyle, why don't you
just pull the fucking alarm?

1088
01:26:56,818 --> 01:26:58,351
Just having
a little fun, brother.

1089
01:26:59,486 --> 01:27:02,955
Okay, people,
here we go!

1090
01:27:02,957 --> 01:27:05,758
Nothing like a good
old-fashioned bank robbery

1091
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,963
- to light a fire under everybody's ass.
- On the ground. On the ground.

1092
01:27:10,865 --> 01:27:12,898
The keys.

1093
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,867
Wait, we don't have any...

1094
01:27:14,869 --> 01:27:17,004
Let's try that again.

1095
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:19,640
Keys.

1096
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:24,476
Let's avoid
being a hero today, folks.

1097
01:27:24,478 --> 01:27:26,045
Nothin' in it for you.

1098
01:27:26,047 --> 01:27:27,646
- You just need to believe in your families...
- Say hi to the camera.

1099
01:27:27,648 --> 01:27:31,519
...to wonder why you bothered to give
a flying shit when you didn't have to.

1100
01:27:32,787 --> 01:27:33,788
Check that out.

1101
01:27:41,461 --> 01:27:42,597
Oh, shit.

1102
01:27:44,832 --> 01:27:47,365
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1103
01:27:47,367 --> 01:27:48,836
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1104
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,505
Watch him.

1105
01:28:03,084 --> 01:28:05,385
Play it cool.
Play it cool.

1106
01:28:07,755 --> 01:28:09,023
Fucking shit!

1107
01:28:10,558 --> 01:28:12,591
You're really
pissing me off, man.

1108
01:28:12,593 --> 01:28:14,794
- Where's the fucking money?
- What money?

1109
01:28:14,796 --> 01:28:18,429
It alternates on a three-week schedule.

1110
01:28:18,431 --> 01:28:20,733
It came in yesterday morning,
went out yesterday afternoon.

1111
01:28:20,735 --> 01:28:24,402
- Kyle, let's get the fuck out of here.
- No! The money is here.

1112
01:28:24,404 --> 01:28:27,740
- Where the fuck are you hiding it, man?
- We don't hide it.

1113
01:28:27,742 --> 01:28:30,375
Why would we hide it if we
didn't know you were coming?

1114
01:28:30,377 --> 01:28:32,077
- It's not here.
- Kyle, let's go!

1115
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:34,613
- Shut the fuck up!
- I don't know who told you it would be here,

1116
01:28:34,615 --> 01:28:36,751
- but it's not.
- Fuck!

1117
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:40,920
- What the fuck!
- Shut the fuck up!

1118
01:28:40,922 --> 01:28:43,856
Shut it, shut it, shut it. Calm down.
Calm down. DEAN: We got the main door, man.

1119
01:28:43,858 --> 01:28:45,591
- Let's fucking go, all right? There's nothing...
- What?

1120
01:28:45,593 --> 01:28:47,092
- Nothing's here, man.
- What?

1121
01:28:47,094 --> 01:28:49,762
- If we fuckin' wait, we're going to fucking jail.
- Everybody, go.

1122
01:28:49,764 --> 01:28:51,730
Everybody, go!
Move! Move out!

1123
01:28:51,732 --> 01:28:55,536
Face down on the ground,
now. Now.

1124
01:28:56,971 --> 01:28:59,106
Let's go. Go, go! Come on!

1125
01:29:03,511 --> 01:29:05,680
- You are fucking up.
- Shut the fuck up.

1126
01:29:15,523 --> 01:29:17,525
Police.
Show us your fucking hands!

1127
01:29:23,496 --> 01:29:25,531
What the fuck's that?

1128
01:29:25,533 --> 01:29:27,635
What the fuck
is that?

1129
01:29:31,939 --> 01:29:33,841
It's the cops.

1130
01:29:36,143 --> 01:29:37,578
What?

1131
01:29:38,346 --> 01:29:40,748
- What?
- Cops. Fucking everywhere.

1132
01:29:42,617 --> 01:29:43,718
Fuck.

1133
01:29:44,619 --> 01:29:45,720
Shit!

1134
01:29:54,695 --> 01:29:55,930
What the fuck did you do?

1135
01:29:57,732 --> 01:29:59,600
What? Nothing.

1136
01:30:00,968 --> 01:30:02,469
Just give me this shit!

1137
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:08,042
You fucked me.

1138
01:30:10,144 --> 01:30:14,113
- You both fucked me.
- Put the fucking gun down, Kyle!

1139
01:30:14,115 --> 01:30:17,850
We've got ourselves a
bit of a Mexican stand-off, huh?

1140
01:30:19,887 --> 01:30:21,923
Where is all the money
you promised us, Kyle?

1141
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:25,925
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking bitch!

1142
01:30:25,927 --> 01:30:30,463
Huh? Where are the fucking six
figures you promised us, Kyle?

1143
01:30:32,867 --> 01:30:34,800
Okay.

1144
01:30:34,802 --> 01:30:36,170
You guys want to go down
like this?

1145
01:30:39,907 --> 01:30:40,908
Fuck it.

1146
01:30:41,142 --> 01:30:42,143
Hey!

1147
01:31:18,846 --> 01:31:19,847
Dean?

1148
01:31:20,681 --> 01:31:21,880
Baby?

1149
01:31:21,882 --> 01:31:24,552
Oh. Oh.

1150
01:31:25,186 --> 01:31:26,952
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Baby.

1151
01:31:26,954 --> 01:31:28,554
Okay, we can get you
to a hospital

1152
01:31:28,556 --> 01:31:30,222
because the police
are right outside.

1153
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:34,195
- What?
- No.

1154
01:31:37,698 --> 01:31:39,266
Now we both get what we want.

1155
01:31:42,236 --> 01:31:44,970
No, no, no, no, no. This is not what I want.

1156
01:31:44,972 --> 01:31:47,708
This is not what I want.

1157
01:31:48,609 --> 01:31:49,710
Hey.

1158
01:31:50,745 --> 01:31:51,879
Baby doll.

1159
01:31:54,115 --> 01:31:55,750
Let me taste those lips.

1160
01:31:58,352 --> 01:31:59,918
Oh.

1161
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:26,881
Fuck. Fuck.

1162
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:07,354
I believe in fate.

1163
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,158
I believe...

1164
01:33:12,326 --> 01:33:15,362
that the universe
has a plan for me.

1165
01:33:16,297 --> 01:33:18,099
Well, for you, for everybody.

1166
01:33:20,234 --> 01:33:21,635
Doesn't it, really?

1167
01:33:25,673 --> 01:33:26,974
So, um...

1168
01:33:29,176 --> 01:33:31,178
my question is, uh...

1169
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:37,651
is this my destiny?

1170
01:33:42,923 --> 01:33:44,058
Is this...

1171
01:33:46,127 --> 01:33:48,129
what I've been fighting for?

1172
01:36:55,384 --> 01:37:00,384

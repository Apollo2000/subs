2
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,959
- <i>Troy, you ought to stop that lying.</i>
- <i>I ain't lying.</i>

3
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,759
<i>Nigger had a watermelon this big,</i>

4
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,719
<i>talking about,
"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"</i>

5
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,479
<i>I'd like to fell out.
"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"</i>

6
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,359
And it sitting there, big as life.

7
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,557
- What Mr. Rand say?
- He ain't said nothing.

8
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,235
He figure, if the nigger was too dumb to
know he's carrying a watermelon,

9
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,118
he wasn't going to get
much sense out of him.

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,999
Trying to hide that great, big,
old watermelon under his coat.

11
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,595
Afraid to let the white man
see him carry it home.

12
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,475
I'm like you.
I ain't got no time for them kinda people.

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,074
Now, what he look like getting mad

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,157
'cause he seen the man from the union
talking to Mr. Rand?

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,472
He come up to me, talking about
"Troy Maxson gonna get us fired."

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,756
I told him, "Get away from me with that."

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,309
He walked away from me
calling you a troublemaker.

18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,353
What Mr. Rand say?

19
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,113
He ain't said nothing. Told me to go down

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,998
to the Commissioner's office next Friday.

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,680
They called me down there to see them.

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,190
Well, as long as you got your
complaint filed, they can't fire you.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,600
That's what one of them
white fellas tell me.

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,915
I ain't worried about them firing me.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,276
What, they gonna fire me
'cause I asked a question?

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,430
That's all I did.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,597
I went to Mr. Rand and I asked him.

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,670
I asked him, "Why?

29
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,956
"Why you got all the white mens driving,
and the colored lifting?"

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,952
Told him, "What's the matter?
Don't I count?

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,032
"Think only white fellows
got sense enough to drive a truck?"

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,396
"Hell, that ain't no paper job.
Anybody can drive a truck.

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,676
"How come you got all the whites driving
and the colored lifting?"

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,074
He told me, "Take it to the union."
Well, hell, that's what I done.

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,311
Now they want to come up
with this pack of lies.

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,835
I told Brownie if the man
come and ask him any questions,

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,235
just tell the truth.

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,276
Ain't nothing but somebody trumped it up
on you 'cause you filed a complaint on.

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,635
Brownie ain't got that much sense.

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,915
Man wasn't thinking about nothing.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,832
All I want them to do
is change the job description,

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,559
give everybody a chance
to drive the truck.

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,234
Brownie can't see that.
He ain't got that much sense.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,720
How you figure he be making out

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,235
with that gal,
be up in Taylors' all the time?

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,039
- That Alberta gal?
- Who?

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,440
Brownie.

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,910
Same as you and me,
getting about as much as we is.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,469
- Which is to say nothing.
- It is, huh?

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,075
Well, I figure
you doing a little better than me.

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,719
And I ain't saying what I'm doing!

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,679
Nigger, look here. I know you.

53
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,717
If you had gotten anywhere near that gal,

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,031
20 minutes later,
you'd be looking to tell somebody.

55
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,520
And the first one you gonna want to tell,

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,557
that you gonna want to brag to
is going to be me.

57
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,030
I ain't saying that.

58
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,157
I see where you be eyeing her.

59
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,630
I eye all the women. I don't miss nothing.

60
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,916
Don't never let nobody tell you
Troy Maxson don't eye the women.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,320
Hey, you been doing more than eyeing her.

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,595
You done bought her a drink or two.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
Hell, yeah, I bought her a drink.
What that mean?

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,275
I bought you one, too.

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,999
What that mean, 'cause I buy her a drink?

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,476
- I'm just being polite.
- It's all right to buy her one drink.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,279
That's what you call being polite.

68
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,079
But when you want to be
buying two or three,

69
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,560
that's what you call eyeing her.

70
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,313
Look here. As long as you've known me,

71
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,278
you ever known me to chase after women?

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,070
Hell, yeah! Long as I've known you.
You're forgetting, I knew you when.

73
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,914
I'm talking about
since I been married to Rose.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,400
Not since you been married to Rose.

75
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,678
- That's the truth, though. I can say that.
- All right then. Case closed.

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,040
I see you be walking up
around Alberta's house.

77
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,919
You supposed to be at Taylors',
and you be walking up around there.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,070
What you watching where I'm walking for?

79
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,310
I don't be watching after you.

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,312
No, I seen you walking
around there more than once.

81
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,754
Hell, you liable
to see me walking anywhere.

82
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,797
That don't mean nothing 'cause
you seen me walking around there.

83
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,075
Where'd she come from, anyway?

84
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,429
She just kinda showed up one day.

85
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,831
Tallahassee. You can look at that
and tell she one of them Florida gals.

86
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,151
They got some big,
healthy women down there.

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,072
Grow them right up out of the ground.

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,719
She got a little bit of Indian in her.

89
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,678
Most of them niggers in Florida
got some Indian in them.

90
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,797
Yeah, I don't know about that Indian part,

91
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,839
but she damn sure big and healthy.

92
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,957
Woman wears some big stockings.

93
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,193
Got them crazy big legs,
and hips wide as the Mississippi River.

94
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,760
Legs don't mean nothing.

95
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,433
You don't do nothing
but push 'em out of the way.

96
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,119
But them hips,

97
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,159
- they cushion the ride.
- Troy, you ain't got no sense!

98
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,233
It's the truth.
Like you riding on Goodyears!

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,357
What you all out here getting into?

100
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,716
What you worried about
what we getting into for, woman?

101
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,836
This is men talk.

102
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
What I care
what you all are talking about?

103
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,674
Bono, you gonna stay for supper?

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,080
No, thank you, Rose,

105
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,436
but Lucille say she cooking up
a pot of pigfeet.

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,557
Pigfeet? Hell, I'm going home with you.

107
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,996
I might even stay the night,
you got some pigfeet.

108
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,878
You got something in there
to top them pigfeet, Rose?

109
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,191
I'm cooking up some chicken.
I got some chicken and collard greens.

110
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,475
Well, you go on back in the house.

111
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,880
Let me and Bono
finish what we talking about.

112
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,680
This is men talk.
I got some talk for you later.

113
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,752
And you know what kind of talk
I mean, too.

114
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,320
You go on in there and powder it up.

115
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
Troy, stop it!

116
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,673
Woman, come here.

117
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,156
Look here, Bono.

118
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,675
When I first met this woman,

119
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,558
I got out that place.

120
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,599
<i>Hitch up my pony, saddle up my mare</i>

121
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,320
<i>There's a woman out there for me somewhere</i>

122
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,314
I looked at here, looked at there,
saw Rose, and I latched on to her.

123
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,791
I latched on to her and I told her...
Now, I'm gonna tell you the truth.

124
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,359
I latched on to her and told her,
"Baby, I don't want to marry.

125
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,079
"I just want to be your man."

126
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,595
Rose told me...
Tell him what you told me, Ro.

127
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,518
I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,

128
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,831
then move out of the way,
so the marrying kind could find me.

129
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,355
That's what she told me,
"Nigger, you in my way.

130
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,760
"You blocking the view.

131
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,797
"Move out the way,
so I can find me a husband."

132
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,315
- I thought it over 2-3 days.
- Two-three days, nothing.

133
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,874
You was back the same night.

134
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,111
I come back, told her, "Okay, baby,

135
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,998
"but I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster

136
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,719
"and put him out there in the backyard.

137
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,234
"And when he see a stranger come,

138
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,720
"he gonna flap his wings and crow."

139
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,871
Look here, Bono. I done
watched that front door by myself.

140
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,714
It was that back door I was worried about.

141
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,235
Don't talk like that!
Troy, you're not but telling a lie.

142
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,634
Only thing was, we first got married,
forget the rooster. We ain't had no yard.

143
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,870
I hear you tell it.

144
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,350
Me and Lucille was staying
down there on Logan Street.

145
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,909
Had two rooms
with the outhouse in the back.

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,593
I ain't mind the outhouse none.

147
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,189
But when that goddamn wind
blew through there in the winter,

148
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,999
that's what I'm talking about!

149
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,200
To this day, I wonder why the hell I ever
stayed down there for six long years.

150
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,749
But, see,
I didn't know I could do no better.

151
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,560
I thought only white folks
had inside toilets and things.

152
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,835
A lot of folks don't think

153
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,479
they can do no better
than they're doing now.

154
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,678
Just something you gotta learn.
A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.

155
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,353
Ain't nothing wrong with Bella's.
She got fresh food.

156
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,272
I ain't said nothing about
if she got fresh food.

157
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,680
I'm talking about what she charge.

158
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,638
She charges 10 cents more than the A&P.

159
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,279
A&P ain't never done nothing for me.

160
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,192
I spend my money where I'm treated right.

161
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,600
I go down to Bella, say,

162
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,115
"I need a loaf of bread, I'll pay you
Friday," she gives it to me.

163
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,032
What sense that make when I got money

164
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,440
to spend it somewhere else

165
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,113
and ignore the person
who done right by me?

166
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,236
That ain't in the Bible.

167
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,595
We ain't talking about
what's in the Bible.

168
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,871
What sense it make to shop there
when she overcharges?

169
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,440
Well, you do your shopping
where you want to,

170
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,074
I do my shopping
where people been good to me.

171
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,117
I don't think it's right for her
to overcharge, that's all.

172
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,350
Look here, I got to be getting on.

173
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,880
Lucille gonna be raising all kind of hell.

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,559
Where you going, nigger?
We ain't finished this pint.

175
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,756
Come here finish this pint.

176
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,800
Well, hell, I am,
if you ever turn the bottle loose.

177
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,238
Only thing I'll say about the A&P is,
I'm glad Cory got that job down there.

178
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,113
Help him with
his school clothes and things.

179
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,510
Gabe done moved out,
things getting tight around here.

180
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,829
He got that job,

181
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,479
he can start to look out for himself.

182
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,792
Cory done got recruited
by a college football team.

183
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,038
I told that boy about
that college football stuff.

184
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,919
The white man ain't gonna let
him get nowhere with that football.

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,992
I told him
when he first come to me with it.

186
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,675
Now, you come telling me
he done got more tied up in it.

187
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,831
He ought to get recruited
in how to fix cars,

188
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,115
or some way he can make a living.

189
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,630
He ain't talking about
making no living playing football.

190
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,712
It's just something the boys in school do.

191
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,917
They're gonna send a recruiter by
to talk to you. He'll tell you.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,992
He ain't talking about
making no living playing football.

193
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,594
It's an honor to be recruited.

194
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,115
It ain't gonna get him nowhere,
Bono'll tell you that.

195
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,478
If he be like you in sports,
he gonna be all right.

196
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,029
Ain't but two men ever played
baseball good as you.

197
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,197
That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.

198
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,431
Them the only two men ever
hit more home runs than you.

199
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,796
And what it ever get me?
I ain't got a pot to piss in,

200
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,195
or a window to throw it out of.

201
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,033
Times have changed since
you were playing baseball, Troy.

202
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,157
That was before the war.
Times have changed a lot since then.

203
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,310
How the hell they done changed?

204
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,914
They got a lot of colored boys
playing ball now.

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,354
Baseball and football.

206
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,478
You right about that, Ro.
Times have changed, Troy.

207
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,914
You just come along too early.

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,676
There ought not never have been
no time called "too early."

209
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,431
Now you take that fellow...

210
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,194
What's that fellow they had playing
right field back then for the Yankees?

211
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,350
You remember who I'm talking about, Bono,

212
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,396
played right field for The Yankees.

213
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,119
- Selkirk?
- Yeah, Selkirk, that's it!

214
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,551
Man's batting 269, you understand? 269!

215
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,350
What sense that make?
I'm batting 432 with 37 home runs!

216
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,433
He's batting 269,
playing right field for the Yankees!

217
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,637
I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.

218
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,394
She's running around
with raggedy shoes on her feet.

219
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,039
I bet you
Selkirk's daughter ain't running around

220
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,918
with no raggedy shoes on her feet.
I bet you that.

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,832
They got a lot of
colored baseball players now.

222
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,070
Jackie Robinson was the first.

223
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,594
Folks had to wait for Jackie Robinson.

224
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,918
I done seen 100 niggers play baseball
better than Jackie Robinson.

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,913
Hell, I seen some teams
Jackie Robinson couldn't even make!

226
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,275
What you talking about, Jackie Robinson?

227
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,033
Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody!

228
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,520
I'm talking about if you could play ball,

229
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,920
then they ought to let you play.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,195
Don't matter what color you are.

231
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,919
Telling me I come along too early.

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,277
If you can play,
then they ought to let you play.

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,195
You gonna drink yourself to death.
You don't need to be drinking like that.

234
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,759
Death ain't nothing. I done seen him,

235
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,150
I done wrestled with him.
You can't tell me nothing about death.

236
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,517
Death ain't nothing
but a fastball on the outside corner,

237
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,435
and you know what I do with that.
Look here, Bono, am I lying?

238
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,354
You get one of them fastballs
about waist high

239
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,033
on the outside corner of the plate

240
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,839
where you can get
the meat of the bat on it,

241
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,152
and, good God, you could kiss it good-bye.

242
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,197
- Am I lying?
- No, you telling the truth.

243
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,794
I seen you do it.

244
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,000
If I'm lying, that's 450 feet worth of lying.
That's all death is to me.

245
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,515
A fastball on the outside corner.

246
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,910
I don't know why you want to
get on talking about death?

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,320
Ain't nothing wrong
with talking about death.

248
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,119
That's a part of life!
Everybody gonna die.

249
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,515
You gonna die. I'm gonna die.

250
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,398
Bono gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.

251
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,836
But you ain't got to talk about it.
I don't like talking about it.

252
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,115
Well, you the one brought it up.

253
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,759
Me and Bono talking about baseball.

254
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,797
You come telling me
I'm gonna drink myself to death.

255
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,155
Ain't that right, Bono?

256
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,471
Now you know I drink just
but one night out the week,

257
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,710
that's Friday night.

258
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,513
I drink just enough to where
I can handle it.

259
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,114
Then I leaves it alone. I cuts it loose.

260
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,237
So, you ain't got to worry
about me drinking myself to death

261
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,919
'cause I ain't worrying about death.

262
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,674
I done seen him, done wrestled with him.

263
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,035
Look here, Bono.

264
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,272
I look up one day,
and Death is marching straight at me,

265
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,477
like soldiers on parade.

266
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,916
The Army of Death
was marching straight at me.

267
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,357
It was the middle of July, 1941.

268
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,671
And it got real cold, just like it be winter.

269
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,353
And it seemed like Death, himself,

270
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,477
reached out
and touched me on the shoulder.

271
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,837
He touched me like I touch you now.
I got cold as ice.

272
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,195
Death standing there, grinning at me.

273
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,999
Troy, why don't you hush that talk.

274
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,357
I said, "What you want, Mr. Death?
You be wanting me?

275
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,318
"You done sent your army
to be getting me?"

276
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,356
I looked him dead in the eye.

277
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,510
I wasn't fearing nothing.

278
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,274
I was ready to tangle,
just like I'm ready to tangle now!

279
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,518
Bible says be ever vigilant.

280
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,910
So, I don't get but so drunk.
I got to keep watch.

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,593
Troy was right down there
at Mercy Hospital.

282
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,034
You remember he had that pneumonia,

283
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,032
laying there with a fever,
talking plumb out his head.

284
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,395
And Death standing there, staring at me,

285
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,920
carrying that sickle in his hand.

286
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,758
Finally, he say, "You want to be
bound over for another year?"

287
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,991
Just like that. He say,

288
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,869
"You want to be bound over
for another year?"

289
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,954
I said, "Bound over, hell!
We can settle this right now."

290
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,471
He kinda fell back when I said that.
And all the cold went out of me.

291
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,552
I reached down, I grabbed that sickle.

292
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,433
I threw it as far as I could throw it,

293
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,193
and me and him commenced to wrestling.

294
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,796
We wrestled for... Carry the six...
Three days and three nights!

295
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,190
Now, I don't know
where I got the strength from,

296
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,999
'cause every time
he tried to get the best of me,

297
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,199
I reached way deep down inside myself,
found the strength to do him one better.

298
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,873
Every time Troy tells that story,

299
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,189
he find different ways to tell it,

300
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,760
different things to make up.

301
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,240
I ain't making up nothing, woman.

302
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,879
I'm telling you
the facts of what happened.

303
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,236
I wrestled with Death
for three days and three nights,

304
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,795
and I'm standing here
to tell you about it.

305
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,157
All right. At the end of the third night,

306
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,312
we done weakened each other
to where we can't even hardly move.

307
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,390
Death stood up.

308
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,676
He threw on that robe,
had a white robe with a hood on it.

309
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,077
He throwed on that robe
and went off to look for that sickle.

310
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,836
He said, "I'll be back."
Just like that. "I'll be back."

311
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,038
I said, "Yeah?
Well, you gonna have to find me!"

312
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,236
I wasn't no fool.

313
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,120
I wasn't going looking for him.

314
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,760
I know Death ain't nothing to play with.
And I know he's gonna get me.

315
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,878
I know I got to join his army,
his camp followers.

316
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,839
But as long as I keep up my strength
and see him coming,

317
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,800
as long as I keep up my vigilance,
he gonna have to fight to get me.

318
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,155
I ain't going easy.

319
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,236
Well, look here,
since you got to keep up your vigilance,

320
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,754
let me have the bottle.

321
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,752
Hell, I shouldn't have told you that part.

322
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,956
I should have left out that part.

323
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,520
Troy be talking all that stuff.

324
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,956
Half the time, he don't even know
what he be talking about!

325
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,037
- Yeah, Bono know me better than that.
- That's right, I know you.

326
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,318
I know you got some
Uncle Remus in your blood.

327
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,676
You got more stories
than the devil got sinners.

328
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,355
Hell, I done seen him, too.
Done talked to the devil.

329
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,079
Nobody wants to be hearing that stuff!

330
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,155
Hey, Pop.

331
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,754
What you come "Hey, Poppin'" me for?

332
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,911
How you doing, Rose?

333
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,515
Mr. Bono, how you doing?

334
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,273
Hey, Lyons, how you been?

335
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,794
He must've been doing all right.

336
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,030
I ain't seen him around here last week.

337
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,759
Troy, leave your boy alone.
He come by to see you

338
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,354
and you want to start all that nonsense.

339
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,760
I ain't bothering Lyons.
Here, get you a drink.

340
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,320
Me and him got an understanding.

341
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,552
I know why he come by to see me,
and he know I know.

342
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,518
Come on, Pop. I just stopped by to say hi,

343
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,670
see how you was doing.

344
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,752
- You ain't stopped by yesterday.
- You staying for supper, Lyons?

345
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,069
I got some chicken cooking in the oven.

346
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,958
No, Rose, thanks.
I just was in the neighborhood

347
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,440
and thought I'd stop by for a minute.

348
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, you was
in the neighborhood all right.

349
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,355
Nigger, you telling the truth there.

350
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,193
You was in the neighborhood
'cause it's my payday.

351
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,511
Well, hell, since you mentioned it,
let me have $10.

352
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,358
I'll be damned. I'll die and go to hell

353
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,909
and play blackjack with the devil
before I give you $10.

354
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,879
That's what I want to know about,
that devil you done seen.

355
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,111
Pop done seen the devil?
You too much, Pop.

356
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,431
- Yeah, I done seen him.
- He ain't seen no devil.

357
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,637
I told him that man
ain't had nothing to do with the devil.

358
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,791
Anything he can't understand,
he want to call it the devil.

359
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,078
Look here, Bono. I go by Hertzberger's
to get some furniture.

360
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,959
You got three rooms for $298.
That what it say on the radio.

361
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,397
"Three rooms, $298."
He made up a little song about it.

362
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,473
I get down there,
man tell me I can't get no credit.

363
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,791
I'm working every day,
can't get no credit.

364
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,996
What to do?

365
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,793
I got an empty house
with some raggedy furniture.

366
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,036
Cory ain't got no bed.

367
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,237
He's sleeping on a pile of rags
on the floor.

368
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,357
Working every day, can't get no credit.

369
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,840
I come back here, Rose'll tell you,

370
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,798
madder than hell,
trying to figure out what to do.

371
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,236
Come a knock on the door.

372
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,357
I ain't been living but three days,
who know I'm here?

373
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,597
I open the door. Devil standing there.

374
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,716
Bigger than life.

375
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,678
White fella,
got on good clothes and everything.

376
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,910
Standing there
with a clipboard in his hand.

377
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,275
Now, I ain't got to say nothing.

378
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,834
First words come out of his mouth,

379
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,754
"I understand you need some furniture
and can't get no credit."

380
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,311
I liked to fell over. He said,
"I'll give you all the credit you want,

381
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,392
"but you gonna have to pay
the interest on it."

382
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,914
Now, I told him,
he give me them three rooms,

383
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,480
he can charge whatever he want.

384
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,199
Next day, a truck pull up here,

385
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,919
two men unload them three rooms.

386
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,236
Man what drove the truck give me a book.

387
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,757
Said first of the month,
send $10 to the address in the book,

388
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,950
everything'll be fine.

389
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,520
Said if you miss a payment,

390
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,274
the devil was coming back,
and there'll be hell to pay.

391
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,874
That was 15 years ago.

392
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,476
To this day, first day of every month,
I send my $10,

393
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,954
just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.

394
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,874
- Troy lying.
- I ain't never seen that man since.

395
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,838
Now, you tell me,
who else that gonna be but the devil?

396
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,991
And I ain't sold my soul
or nothing like that.

397
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,800
No, I wouldn't have truck with the devil
over nothing like that.

398
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,476
But I got my furniture.
And I send my $10, just like clockwork.

399
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,439
How long you say
you been paying this $10 a month?

400
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,556
15 years.

401
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,316
Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?
How much the man done charge you?

402
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,632
Hell, I done paid for it.
I done paid for it 10 times over.

403
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,995
Fact is, I'm scared to stop paying.

404
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,515
Troy lying.
We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.

405
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,319
He ain't paying no $10 a month to nobody.

406
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,676
Hell, woman,
Bono know I ain't that big a fool.

407
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,315
I was just getting ready to say,
I know where there's a bridge for sale.

408
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,470
I'll tell you this.

409
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,313
It don't matter to me if it was the devil.

410
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,754
It don't matter if the devil give credit.

411
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,752
- Somebody got to give it.
- It ought to matter.

412
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,116
You walking around here saying
you gonna make truck with the devil,

413
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,634
God's the one
you're gonna have to answer to.

414
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,234
He's the one gonna be at the Judgment.

415
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,232
Yeah, well, look here, Pop,
let me have that $10.

416
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,476
I'll give it back to you.

417
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,994
Bonnie got a job working at the hospital.

418
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,150
Bono, what did I tell you?

419
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,839
Only time I see this nigger
is when he want something.

420
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,070
That's the only time I see him.

421
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,710
Come on, Pop,
Mr. Bono don't want to hear all that.

422
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,996
Let me have the $10.
I told you, Bonnie's working!

423
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,435
What that mean to me if Bonnie's working?

424
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,672
I don't care if she working.
Go ask her for $10 if she's working.

425
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,434
Talking about Bonnie working.
Why ain't you working?

426
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,877
Pop, you know I can't find no decent job.

427
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,917
Where am I gonna get a job at?
You know I can't get no job.

428
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,316
I told you, I know some people down there.

429
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,232
I can get you on the rubbish
if you want to work.

430
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,119
I told you that last time you
come back here asking for something.

431
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,475
No, Pop, thanks, that ain't for me.

432
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,080
I don't want to be carrying
nobody's rubbish.

433
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,992
I don't want to be punching
nobody's time clock.

434
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,072
What's the matter?
You too good to carry people's rubbish?

435
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,038
Where you think that $10
you talking about comes from?

436
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,873
I'm just supposed to haul people's rubbish

437
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,838
and give my money to you
'cause you too lazy to work?

438
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,036
You're too lazy to work

439
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,713
and want to know
why you ain't got what I got.

440
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,439
What hospital Bonnie working at, Mercy?

441
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,273
She down at Passavant,
working in the laundry.

442
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,192
I ain't got nothing as it is. I give you $10,

443
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,634
I got to eat beans the rest of the week?

444
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,120
No, you ain't getting no $10 over here.

445
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,720
You ain't got to be eating no beans.

446
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,075
I don't know why you want to say that?

447
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,992
I ain't got no extra money!

448
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,030
Gabe done moved out,

449
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,476
giving his money over there
to Miss Pearl, paying her rent.

450
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,755
Things done got tight around here.

451
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,320
I can't afford to be
giving you every payday.

452
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,040
I ain't asked you to give me nothing.
I asked you to loan me $10.

453
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,190
I know you got $10.

454
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,397
Yeah, I got it. You know why I got it?

455
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,756
'Cause I don't throw my money away
on them streets.

456
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,877
You want to live the fast life,
being a musician,

457
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,599
running around in them clubs and things,

458
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,114
then learn to take care of yourself.

459
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,352
You ain't gone find me asking
nobody for nothing!

460
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,760
I spent too many years without.

461
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,274
Hey, you and me is two different people.

462
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,592
I done learned my mistake
and I learned to do what's right by it.

463
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,353
You still trying to get
something for nothing.

464
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,590
Life don't owe you nothing.

465
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,275
You owe it to yourself.
Ask Bono. He'll tell you I'm right.

466
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,795
You got your way of
dealing with the world, I got mine.

467
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,678
Only thing that matters to me
is the music.

468
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,111
Yeah, I can see that.
Don't matter how you gonna eat,

469
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,554
don't matter where your next dollar
coming from.

470
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,120
Yeah, you telling the truth there.

471
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,271
I know I got to eat. But I got to live, too.

472
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,751
I need something that's gonna help me
get out of bed in the morning,

473
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,354
make me feel like I belong in the world.

474
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,113
I don't bother nobody.

475
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,350
I just stay with my music

476
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,591
'cause that's the only way
I can find to live in the world.

477
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,275
Otherwise, ain't no telling
what I might do.

478
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,239
I don't come by
criticizing you and how you live.

479
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,279
I just come by to ask you for $10.

480
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,471
I don't want to hear all that about
how I live.

481
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,995
Boy, your mama did
a hell of a job raising you.

482
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,754
You can't change me, Pop.
I'm 34 years old.

483
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,755
If you wanted to change me,

484
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,593
you should have been there
when I was growing up.

485
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,470
I come by to see you, ask you for $10,

486
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,314
and you want to talk about
how I was raised?

487
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,916
You don't know nothing
about how I was raised.

488
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,830
Let the boy have $10, Troy.

489
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,113
Hell you looking at?
You know I ain't got no money.

490
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,032
You know what I do with my money.

491
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,952
Go on, give him $10
if you want him to have it.

492
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,358
I will, soon as you turn it loose.

493
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,192
There it is.

494
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,317
Seventy six dollars and twenty-two cents.

495
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,674
You see this, Bono?
I ain't gonna get but six of that back.

496
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,753
He ought to stop telling that lie.
Here, Lyons.

497
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,190
Thanks, Rose.

498
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,874
Look, I got to run. I'll see you all later.

499
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,111
Wait a minute.
You gonna say, "Thanks, Rose,"

500
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,032
but you ain't gonna look to see
where she got that money from.

501
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,237
- You see how they do me, Bono?
- I know she got it from you, Pop.

502
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,676
- Thanks. I'll give it back to you.
- There you go, telling another lie.

503
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,991
Time I see that $10,
you'll be owing me $30 more.

504
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,958
- See you, Mr. Bono.
- Take care, Lyons.

505
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,110
Thanks, Pop. I'll see you again.

506
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,553
I don't know why that boy don't go
and get him a decent job

507
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,915
and take care of that woman he got.

508
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,515
He'll be all right, Troy.
The boy is still young!

509
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,231
- The boy is 34 years old.
- Let's not get off into all that.

510
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,472
Look here, I got to go. I got to be going.
Lucille gonna be waiting.

511
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,634
See this woman, Bono? I love this woman.

512
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,153
I love her so much, it hurts.

513
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,280
I love her so much,
I done run out of ways of loving her,

514
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,591
so, I got to get back to basics.

515
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,433
Don't you come by my house Monday morning,

516
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,670
talking about time to go to work.

517
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,911
- 'Cause I'm gonna still be stroking.
- Troy, stop!

518
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,311
I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.
That ain't nothing but gin talk.

519
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,437
Go on, Troy! I'll see you Monday.

520
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,751
Don't you come by my house, nigger!

521
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,671
I done told you what I'm gonna be doing!

522
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,197
Come back on Tuesday!

523
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,557
<i>Jesus be a fence</i>

524
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,396
<i>All around me</i>

525
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,278
<i>Every day</i>

526
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,758
Good morning.

527
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,797
You ready for breakfast?
I can fix you some

528
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,156
soon as I finish hanging up these clothes.

529
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,792
I got the coffee on. That's all right.
I just have some of that this morning.

530
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,309
That 651 hit yesterday.

531
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,234
That's the second time this month
Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.

532
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,630
Seems like those that need the least
always get lucky.

533
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,910
Poor folks can't get nothing.

534
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,320
Them numbers don't know nobody.

535
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,551
I don't know why you fool with 'em,
you and Lyons both.

536
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,160
It's something to do.

537
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,516
You ain't doing nothing
but throwing your money away.

538
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,159
Troy, you know I don't play foolishly.

539
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,833
I just play a nickel here
and a nickel there.

540
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,434
That's two nickels you done throwed away.

541
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,160
Nah, I hit sometimes.
That makes up for it.

542
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,754
Always comes in handy when I do hit.

543
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,990
I don't hear you complaining then.

544
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,958
I ain't complaining now.
I just say it's foolish,

545
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,192
trying to guess out of 600 ways
which way the number gonna come.

546
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,839
If I had all the money these niggers...

547
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,434
You negroes throw away
on numbers in one week,

548
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,354
just one week, I'd be a rich man.

549
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,920
You wishing and calling it foolish

550
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,593
ain't gonna stop folks
from playing the numbers.

551
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,717
That's one thing for sure.

552
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,952
Besides, some good things
come from playing numbers.

553
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,999
Look where Pope done bought him
that restaurant off of numbers.

554
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,711
I can't stand niggers like that.
Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.

555
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,520
He running around with his shoes
all run-over,

556
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,592
bumming money for cigarettes.

557
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,593
All right.
Got lucky there, hit the numbers...

558
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,034
Troy, I know all about it.

559
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,874
Had good sense. I'll say that for him.
Man ain't throw his money away.

560
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,795
I done see niggers go through
$2,000 in four days.

561
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,395
Man built him that restaurant down there.

562
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,994
Fix it up real nice, too.

563
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,958
Then he won't let nobody come in it.

564
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,350
Negro go in there,
can't get no kind of service.

565
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,717
Seen a white fella go in there,
he orders a bowl of stew.

566
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,071
Pope pick all the meat
out of the pot for him.

567
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,117
Man ain't had nothing but a bowl of meat!

568
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,680
Negro go in there behind him,

569
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,717
he ain't got nothing
but the potatoes and the carrots.

570
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,917
Talking about what numbers do for people.

571
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,229
You picked the wrong example there.

572
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,391
Ain't done nothing
but made a worser fool out of him

573
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,273
than he already was before.

574
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,440
Troy.

575
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,752
You ought to stop worrying about
what happened at work yesterday.

576
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,360
I ain't worried.

577
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,991
Just called me down there,
the Commissioner's office,

578
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,760
everybody's worried about them firing me.

579
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,719
I ain't worrying about them firing me.

580
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,031
You ain't got to worry about that.

581
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,271
Where's Cory? Cory in the house?

582
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,831
- Cory!
- He gone out.

583
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,673
Out? Yeah, he going out

584
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,639
'cause he know
I want him to work on this fence.

585
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,632
I know how he is.
That boy is scared of working.

586
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,995
He ain't done a lick of work in his life.

587
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,560
He had to go to football practice.

588
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,632
Coach wanted them
to get in a little extra practice

589
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,995
before the season start.

590
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,753
Yeah, I got his practice all right.

591
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,116
Running out of here
before he gets his chores done.

592
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,793
Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?

593
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,996
Don't nothing set right with you.

594
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,436
Go on back in there, go to bed,
and get up on the other side.

595
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,795
Why something got to be wrong with me?

596
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,950
I ain't said nothing wrong with me.

597
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,520
Well, you got something to say
about everything.

598
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,353
First, it's the numbers,
then it's the way the man

599
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,272
run his restaurant,
then you done got on Cory.

600
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,874
What's it gonna be next?

601
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,151
Take a look up there,
see if the weather suit you.

602
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,720
Or is it gonna be
how you gonna put up this fence

603
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,115
with the clothes hanging in the yard?

604
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,793
You hit the nail on the head then.

605
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,951
I know you
like I know the back of my hand.

606
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,872
Come on in here
and get you some more coffee,

607
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,519
see if that don't straighten you up.

608
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,279
'Cause you ain't right this morning.

609
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,432
<i>Three for a quarter</i>

610
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,556
<i>Come and buy now 'cause I'm here today</i>

611
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,955
<i>Yes, sir, I got plums</i>

612
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,000
<i>Ask me how I sell 'em</i>

613
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,311
<i>Ten cents apiece, three for a quarter</i>

614
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,880
<i>Come and buy now</i>

615
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,950
Hey!

616
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,157
<i>'Cause I'm here today</i>
<i>Tomorrow, I'll be gone</i>

617
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,709
There's Troy. Hey, Troy.

618
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,950
Hey, Gabe.

619
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,754
- Hey, Rose.
- Hey, Gabe.

620
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,354
What you got there?

621
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,274
You know what I got, Rose?
I got fruits and vegetables.

622
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,158
Where them plums you talking about?

623
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,836
I ain't got no plums today.
I was just singing that.

624
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,590
I'll have some tomorrow.
I put me in a big order for plums.

625
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,880
I'll have enough plums tomorrow
for Saint Peter and everybody!

626
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,314
Troy mad at me.

627
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,790
I ain't mad at you, Gabe.
What I got to be mad at you about?

628
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,950
You ain't done nothing to me.

629
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,478
I just move over to Miss Pearl's
to keep out from in your way.

630
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,789
I ain't mean no harm by it.

631
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,998
Who said anything about that?
I ain't said nothing about that.

632
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,873
You ain't mad at me, is you?

633
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,557
I ain't made at you, Gabe.
If I was mad at you, I'd tell you about it.

634
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,030
Come on, get on out of the street.
Come on.

635
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,710
I got me two rooms in the basement.
I got my own door, too.

636
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,350
You want to see my key?

637
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,516
That's my own key.
Ain't nobody else got a key like that.

638
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,432
That's my key for my two rooms.

639
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,477
That's good, Gabe.
Got your own key, that's good.

640
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,755
You hungry, Gabe?

641
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,479
I was just fixing to cook Troy
some breakfast.

642
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,240
I'll take some biscuits.
You got some biscuits?

643
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,080
Did you know, when I was in Heaven,
every morning, me and Saint Peter

644
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,995
would sit down by the Gate
and eat some big, fat biscuits?

645
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,472
Yeah, we had us a good time.
We'd sit there and eat us them biscuits.

646
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,155
And then Saint Peter
would go off to sleep,

647
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,833
and tell me to wake him up

648
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,196
when it's time to open the Gates
for the Judgment.

649
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,752
Well, come on,
I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.

650
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,794
Hey, Troy. Saint Peter got your name
in his book. I seen it.

651
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,758
It say, "Troy Maxson."

652
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,918
I say, "I know him.

653
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,311
"He got the same name like what I got.

654
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,357
"That's my brother."

655
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,070
How many times
you gonna tell me that, Gabe?

656
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,198
Ain't got my name in the book.
Don't have to have my name.

657
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,511
I done died and went to Heaven.

658
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,593
But he got your name, though.

659
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,991
One morning,
Saint Peter was looking at his book,

660
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,754
and he was marking it up for the Judgment,

661
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,877
and he let me see your name.

662
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,830
He got it in there under "M."
He got Rose's name.

663
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,271
I ain't seen it like I seen yours,
but I know it's in there.

664
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,957
He got a great big book!

665
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,714
He got everybody's name
what was ever been born.

666
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,075
That's what he told me.

667
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,998
But I seen your name.
I seen it with my own eye.

668
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,070
Come in the house.

669
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,560
Rose gonna fix you something to eat now.

670
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,075
I ain't hungry. I done had breakfast

671
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,157
with Aunt Jemima!

672
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,392
She come by,
cook me up a whole mess of flapjacks!

673
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,153
All right. Come on, let's go in the house.
Rose fix us...

674
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,680
Remember how we used to eat
them flapjacks?

675
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,910
Yes, I remember. Come on now.

676
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,116
- I got to go!
- Gabe!

677
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,799
- I got to go!
- Gabe, come on now!

678
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,679
I got to go sell my plums!

679
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,674
I done sold some tomatoes.
Got me two quarters. Want to see?

680
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,472
I'm gonna save 'em and buy me a new horn,

681
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,316
so Saint Peter can hear me
when it's time to open the Gate.

682
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,914
You hear that?

683
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,040
You hear that? That's the hellhound.

684
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,793
I'm gonna chase them out of here.

685
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,715
Go on! Get out of here! Get out! Get out!

686
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,077
<i>All you hypocrite members</i>

687
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,472
<i>Wasting your time away</i>

688
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,395
<i>My God is calling for a workman</i>

689
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,632
<i>You had better obey</i>

690
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,999
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

691
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,473
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment morning</i>

692
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,720
<i>Better get ready for Judgment</i>

693
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,154
<i>My God is coming down</i>

694
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,833
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

695
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,873
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment morning</i>

696
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,994
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

697
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,954
<i>My God is coming down</i>

698
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,793
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

699
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,552
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

700
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,717
Where's Gabe?

701
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,712
He's gone off somewhere.

702
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,476
He ain't eating right.

703
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,517
Miss Pearl say
she can't get him to eat nothing.

704
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,875
What you want me to do about it, Rose?

705
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,397
I did everything I could for the man.
I can't make him get well.

706
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,678
Man got half his head blown off,
what you expect?

707
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,433
Seems like something ought to be done
to help him.

708
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,840
The man don't bother nobody.

709
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,276
He just mixed up
'cause of that metal plate

710
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,034
he got in his head. Ain't no sense in...

711
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,158
Thank you. Ain't no sense
in sending him to the hospital.

712
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,560
At least he'd be eating right.

713
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,040
They could help him take care of himself.

714
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,713
Don't nobody want to be locked up, Rose.

715
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,678
What you want to lock the man up for?

716
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,399
Man going down there,

717
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,679
over there and fight that war,
messing with them Japs,

718
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,433
getting half his head blown off.

719
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,230
They give him a lousy $3,000.
I got to swoop down on that.

720
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,640
Is you fixing to get into that again?

721
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,757
He got a metal plate in his head.

722
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,917
That's the only reason
I got a roof over my head

723
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,514
is 'cause of that metal plate.

724
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,432
Ain't no sense in you
blaming yourself for nothing.

725
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,716
Gabe was in no condition
to manage that money.

726
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,916
You done what was right by him.

727
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,037
Can't nobody say
you ain't done what was right by him.

728
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,474
Look how long you took care of him.

729
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,195
Till he wanted his own place
and moved over there with Miss Pearl.

730
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,795
That ain't what I'm saying, woman.
I'm just...

731
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,834
I'm just stating the facts.

732
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,991
If my brother
didn't have a metal plate in his head,

733
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,514
I wouldn't have a pot to piss in

734
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,000
or a window to throw it out of.

735
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,799
And I'm 53...

736
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,359
Where you going off to?

737
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,113
You been running out of here
every Saturday for weeks.

738
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,034
I thought you were gonna
work on this fence.

739
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,351
I'm gonna go down to Taylors' and...

740
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,870
Mama?

741
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,120
Cory. Your daddy
like to have a fit with you

742
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,079
running out of here this morning
without doing your chores.

743
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,435
You all right?

744
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,797
He say you supposed to be
helping him with the fence.

745
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,280
I told you I had to go to practice.

746
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,352
And he's been saying that
the last four or five Saturdays,

747
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,512
and then don't ever do nothing
but go down to Taylors'.

748
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,031
- You told him about the recruiter?
- Yeah, I told him.

749
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,760
- Well, what'd he say?
- He didn't say nothing too much.

750
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,480
Go on and get started on your chores
before he gets back here.

751
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,200
Go on and scrub down them steps

752
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,159
before he come back here hollering
and carrying on!

753
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,072
Go! Boy, go!

754
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,991
Go on, Troy.
You liked to scare me to death.

755
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,270
What was the score of the game?

756
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,192
Lucille had me on the phone.
I couldn't keep up with it.

757
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,794
What do I care about the game?
Come here, woman.

758
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,030
I thought you went down to Taylors'

759
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,873
to listen to the game. Go on, Troy.

760
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,679
I thought you're supposed to
be putting up the fence.

761
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,116
I'll put it up when I finish with what...

762
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,556
Is at hand.

763
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,711
Go on, Troy. I ain't studying you!

764
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,713
I'm studying you.
I'm finna do my homework.

765
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,473
Troy, you better leave me alone!

766
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,713
Where Cory?
That boy brought his butt home yet?

767
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,200
He's upstairs doing his chores.

768
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,600
Cory, get your butt...

769
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,276
- Where you going?
- I'll be right back.

770
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,955
- When?
- I'm just going right down the street.

771
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,791
Where? Who?

772
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,313
Troy, go in the house!

773
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,398
You just now coming here
from leaving this morning?

774
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,755
- Yeah, I had to go to football practice...
- Yeah, what?

775
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,830
Yes, sir.

776
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,400
I ain't but two seconds off you, no way.

777
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,153
That garbage
sitting in there, overflowing.

778
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,515
You ain't done none of your chores.

779
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,795
Now you come in here,
talking about, "Yeah."

780
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,314
I was just getting ready
to do my chores now, Pop.

781
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,631
Your first chore is to help me
with this fence on Saturday.

782
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,279
Everything else come after that.

783
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,670
Now, get that saw,
we gonna cut these boards.

784
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,791
Hey, Pop. Why don't you buy a TV?

785
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,315
What I want with a TV?
What I want one of them for?

786
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,199
Everybody got one. Earl, Ba Bra, Jesse.

787
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,478
I ain't asked who had one,
I said what I want with one?

788
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,035
So, you can watch it.
They got lots of things on TV.

789
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,349
- Baseball and everything.
- Yeah?

790
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,755
We could watch the World Series.

791
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,797
- Yeah, how much this TV cost?
- I don't know.

792
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,475
They got 'em on sale for about $200.

793
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,199
- $200?
- That ain't that much, Pop.

794
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,870
No, that's just $200.

795
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,071
You see that roof you got
sitting over your head at night?

796
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,272
Let me tell you something about that roof.

797
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,240
It's been 10 years
since that roof was last tarred.

798
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,438
See, now snow come this winter,
sit up on that roof like it is,

799
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,477
it's gonna seep inside,
just gonna be a little bit,

800
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,876
you ain't gonna hardly notice it,
then next thing you know,

801
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,440
it's gonna be leaking all over the house.

802
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,480
Then the wood rot from all that water,
and you gonna need a whole new roof.

803
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,756
Now how much you think it cost
to get that roof fixed?

804
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,080
- I don't know.
- $264 cash money. See?

805
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,879
While you be thinking about a TV,

806
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,113
I got to be thinking about the roof
or whatever else go wrong around here.

807
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,112
Now if you had $200, what would you do?

808
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,590
Fix the roof, or buy a TV?

809
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,070
I'd buy a TV.
And when the roof started to leak,

810
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,475
if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.

811
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,914
Where you gonna get your money from?

812
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,320
You done spent it on a TV.

813
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,791
You gonna sit up in there, let that
water run all over your brand-new TV?

814
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,439
Pop, you got the money. I know you do.

815
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,239
- Where I got it at?
- In the bank.

816
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,595
You want to see my bank book?

817
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,479
You want to see that $73.22
I got sitting up in there?

818
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,233
You don't have to pay for it
all at one time.

819
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,198
You can put a down payment on it,
and carry it on with you.

820
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,954
Not me. I ain't owing nobody nothing
if I can help it.

821
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,600
Miss a payment, they come
and snatch it right out of your house.

822
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,718
Then what you got? See?

823
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,316
Now, when I get $200 clear,
I'll buy me a TV.

824
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,797
Right now, when I get $264,
I'm gonna get that roof fixed.

825
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,870
Pop...

826
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,680
You go get you $200
and buy you a TV if you want to.

827
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,353
I got better things to do with my money.

828
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,671
I can't get $200. I ain't never seen $200.

829
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,309
All right, I'll tell you what.

830
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,598
You get $100,
I'll put the other $100 with it.

831
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,160
All right, I'm gonna show you.

832
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,472
Yeah, show me how you can
cut these boards right now.

833
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,635
There you go. That's $200 worth.

834
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,153
- The Pirates won today.
- Yeah?

835
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,356
That makes five in a row.

836
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,875
I ain't thinking about no Pirates.
They got an all-white team.

837
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,636
Got that boy, though,
that Puerto Rican boy, Clemente?

838
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,030
Don't even half play him.

839
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,112
That boy could be something
if they'd give him a chance.

840
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,238
Play him one day,
sit him on the bench the next.

841
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,549
He gets lots of chances to play.

842
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,552
I'm talking about playing every day,
playing regular,

843
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,199
so you can get your timing,
that's what I'm talking about.

844
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,391
They got some white guys on the team
that don't play every day.

845
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,709
You can't play everybody at the same time.

846
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,598
If they got a white fellow
sitting on the bench,

847
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,320
you can bet your last dollar
he can't play.

848
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,437
Colored guy got to be twice as good
to get on the team.

849
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,319
That's why I don't want you
getting all tied up in them sports.

850
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,437
Man on the team, what it get him?

851
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,477
Got colored on the team,
don't even use him.

852
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,314
Same as not having them.
All them teams the same.

853
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,676
The Braves got Hank Aaron
and Wes Covington.

854
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,792
Hank Aaron hit two home runs today.
That makes 43.

855
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,837
Aaron ain't nobody.
That's what you supposed to do.

856
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,718
That's how the game's supposed
to be played.

857
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,520
Ain't nothing to it. It's a matter of getting
your timing and follow through.

858
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,757
Hell, I can hit 43 home runs right now.

859
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,320
Not off no major-league pitcher,
you couldn't.

860
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,959
We had better pitching
in the Negro leagues.

861
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,793
I hit seven home runs
off of Satchel Paige.

862
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,109
You can't get no better than that.

863
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,873
Sandy Koufax,
he leading the league in strikeouts.

864
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,474
I ain't thinking about no Sandy Koufax.

865
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,313
You got Warren Spahn
and Lew Burdette. I bet you...

866
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,629
I'm through with it now.

867
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,270
Go and cut them boards.

868
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,677
Your mama told me you got
recruited by a college football team.

869
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,080
Is that right?

870
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,512
Yeah, Coach Zellman say the recruiter
gonna be coming by to talk to you.

871
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,637
Get you to sign the permission papers.

872
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,319
I thought you was supposed to
be working down the A&P.

873
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,039
Ain't you supposed to be
working down there after school?

874
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,873
Mr. Stawicki say
he gonna hold my job for me

875
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,360
until after the football season.

876
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,030
He said starting next week,
I can work weekends.

877
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,033
Boy, I thought we had an understanding
about this football stuff.

878
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,839
You supposed to keep up with your chores,

879
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,718
hold your job down there at the A&P.

880
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,996
You ain't been around here all day
on a Saturday,

881
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,355
ain't none of your chores done.

882
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,113
Now you come telling me
you done quit your job?

883
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,277
- I'm gonna be working weekends.
- You damn right you are!

884
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,192
And ain't no need for nobody
to be coming around here,

885
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,430
talking to me about signing nothing.

886
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,556
Pop, you can't do that.

887
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,915
He's coming all the way
from North Carolina.

888
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,872
I don't care where he coming from!

889
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,150
Look, boy,

890
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,680
the white man ain't gonna let you

891
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,558
get nowhere with no football no way.

892
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,156
Now you get your book-learning, so you can

893
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,193
work your way up at the A&P
and learn how to fix cars,

894
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,953
or build houses, get you a trade.

895
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,555
This way, you got something
can't nobody take away from you.

896
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,070
You go in and learn how to
put your hands to good use

897
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,038
besides hauling other people's garbage.

898
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,190
I get good grades, Pop.

899
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,634
That's why the recruiter
want to talk with you.

900
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,279
You got to keep up
your grades to get recruited.

901
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,192
This way, I'll be going to college,
I'll get a chance.

902
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,751
First, you get your butt down there
and get your job back.

903
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,274
Mr. Stawicki done already
hired somebody else

904
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,794
'cause I told him I was playing football.

905
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,272
You a bigger fool than I thought.

906
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,352
You gonna let somebody take away your job,

907
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,760
so you can play some football.

908
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,120
Where you gonna get your money to take
care of your girlfriend and whatnot?

909
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,554
What kind of foolishness is that

910
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,074
to let somebody take away your job?

911
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,389
I'm still gonna be working weekends.

912
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,551
No. You getting out of here
and finding you another job.

913
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,915
Come on, Pop. I gotta practice.

914
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,753
I can't work after school
and play football, too.

915
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,399
The team needs me,
that's what Coach Zellman say.

916
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,631
I don't care what nobody say.
I'm the boss. You understand?

917
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,952
I'm the boss around here.
I do the only saying what counts.

918
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,430
- Come on...
- I asked you, "Do you understand?"

919
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,439
- Yeah.
- What?

920
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,672
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

921
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,790
You get on down there to that A&P
and see if you can get your job back.

922
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,440
If you can't do both,
then you quit the football team.

923
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,637
You got to take the crookeds
with the straights.

924
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,915
Yes, sir.

925
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,592
- Can I ask you a question?
- What the hell you got to ask me?

926
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,479
Mr. Stawicki the one
you got the questions for.

927
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,040
How come you ain't never liked me?

928
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,473
Like you?
Who the hell said I got to like you?

929
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,111
What law is there say I got to like you?

930
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,319
You want to stand up in front of my face
and ask a damn fool-ass question like that.

931
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,675
Talk about liking somebody.

932
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,080
Come here, boy, when I talk to you.

933
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,719
Straighten up, God damn it!
I asked you a question.

934
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,959
- What law is there say I got to like you?
- None.

935
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,032
All right, then. Don't you eat every day?

936
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,834
Answer me when I talk to you.

937
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,956
- Don't you eat every day?
- Yeah.

938
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,753
Nigger, as long as you in my house,

939
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,832
you put a "sir" on the end of it
when you talk to me.

940
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,314
- Yes, sir.
- You eat every day?

941
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,720
- Got a roof over your head?
- Yes, sir.

942
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,995
- Got clothes on your back?
- Yes, sir.

943
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,560
- Why you think that is?
- 'Cause of you.

944
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,240
Hell, I know it's 'cause of me.
But why do you think that is?

945
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,240
'Cause you like me?

946
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,352
"Like" you.

947
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,318
I go out of here every morning,

948
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,711
I bust my butt putting up
with them crackers every day

949
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,519
'cause I "like" you.

950
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,638
You about the biggest fool I ever saw.
It's my job.

951
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,552
It's my responsibility.

952
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,439
A man is supposed to
take care of his family.

953
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,519
You live in my house,
fill your belly with my food,

954
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,196
put your behind on my bed
because you're my son.

955
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,079
Not 'cause I like you.
'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.

956
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,720
I owe a responsibility to you.

957
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,678
Now, let's get this straight
right here and now,

958
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,319
before it go along any further.

959
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,880
I ain't got to like you.

960
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,078
Mr. Rand don't give me my money
come payday 'cause he like me.

961
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,198
He give it to me 'cause he owe me.

962
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,319
Now I done give you everything
I got to give you.

963
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,710
I give you your life!

964
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,280
Me and your mama
worked that out between us,

965
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,478
and liking your black ass
wasn't part of the bargain.

966
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,080
Now don't you go through life

967
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,391
worrying about
whether somebody like you, or not.

968
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,552
You best be making sure
they're doing right by you.

969
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,279
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, sir.

970
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,797
Then get the hell out of my face
and get on down to that A&P!

971
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,595
Why don't you go ahead
and let the boy play football, Troy?

972
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,592
He just want to be like you
with the sports.

973
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,751
I don't want him to be like me.

974
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,433
I want him to get as far away from my life

975
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,590
as he possibly can get.

976
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,831
You the only decent thing
ever happened to me, Rose.

977
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,794
And I wish him that.

978
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,512
But I don't wish him
nothing else from my life.

979
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,434
I decided 17 years ago, that boy
wasn't gonna get involved in no sports.

980
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,159
Not after
what they did to me in the sports.

981
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,471
Why don't you just admit
you were too old for the major leagues?

982
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,153
For once, why don't you just admit that?

983
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,913
Don't you come tellin' me I was too old.

984
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,232
I just wasn't the right color.
Hell, I'm 53 years old,

985
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,432
I can do better than Selkirk's .269
right now.

986
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,876
How were you gonna play ball
when you were over 40?

987
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,633
Sometimes, I can't get
no sense out of you.

988
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,790
I got good sense, woman.

989
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,112
I got sense enough not to let that boy
get hurt playing no sports.

990
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,714
You mothering the boy too much.

991
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,957
Worrying about whether people
"like" him or not.

992
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,317
Everything that boy do, he do for you.

993
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,960
He wants you to say, "Good job, son."
That's all.

994
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,518
I ain't got time for that, Rose.
He's alive, he's healthy.

995
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,957
He's got to make his own way. I made mine.

996
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,595
Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand
when he get out there in the world.

997
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,036
Times have changed, Troy.

998
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,191
People change.

999
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,556
The world changing,
and you can't even see it.

1000
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,834
Woman, I do the best I can do.

1001
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,240
I come in here every Friday,

1002
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,154
I carry a sack of potatoes
and a bucket of lard.

1003
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,836
You all line up at the door
with your hands out.

1004
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,516
I give you the lint from my pockets.
I give you my sweat and my blood.

1005
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,195
I ain't got no tears. I done spent them.

1006
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,915
We go upstairs in that room at night,
I fall down on you

1007
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,516
and try to blast a hole into forever.

1008
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,831
I get up Monday morning,
find my lunch on the table,

1009
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,320
go out and make my way.

1010
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,679
Find my strength
to get me through to next Friday.

1011
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,160
That's all I got, Rose.

1012
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,079
That's all I got to give.

1013
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,794
Can't give nothing else!

1014
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,995
Mr. Maxson?

1015
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,116
Commissioner will see you now.

1016
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,274
Rose!

1017
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,833
Hey, Ro!

1018
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,312
I wish I could've seen Mr. Rand's face
when he told you.

1019
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,194
He couldn't get it out his mouth.
Liked to bit his tongue.

1020
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,192
When they called me down there
to the Commissioner's office,

1021
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,074
he thought they was gonna fire me,
like everybody else.

1022
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,799
I didn't think they was gonna fire you.

1023
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,349
I thought they's gonna put you
on the warning paper.

1024
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,751
Hey, Rose!
Yeah, Mr. Rand liked to bit his tongue.

1025
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,877
I see you run right down there to Taylors'

1026
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,275
and told that Alberta gal.

1027
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,432
Hey, Rose! I told everybody. Hey, Ro!

1028
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,432
I went down there to cash my check.

1029
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,356
Hey!

1030
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,238
Hush all that hollering.
I know you out here.

1031
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,118
What they say down
at the Commissioner's office?

1032
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,998
You supposed to come
when I call you, woman.

1033
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,230
Bono will tell you that.

1034
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,834
Don't Lucille come when you call her?

1035
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,036
Man, hush your mouth. I ain't no dog.

1036
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,440
Talk about come when you call me.

1037
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,074
You hear this, Bono?
I used to have me an old dog

1038
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,230
get uppity like that.

1039
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,880
You say, "Come here, Blue,"
he just lay there, look at you.

1040
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,191
End up getting a stick chasin' him away,
trying to make him come.

1041
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,800
I ain't studying you and your dog.

1042
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,473
I remember you used to sing that old song.

1043
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,871
<i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>

1044
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,753
<i>Had an old dog, his name was Blue</i>

1045
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,354
Nobody wants to hear that old song.

1046
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,073
<i>You know Blue was mighty true</i>

1047
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,231
Used to have Cory runnin' around here
singin' that song.

1048
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,993
Hell, I remember that song myself.

1049
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,436
<i>You know Blue was a good old dog</i>

1050
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,836
<i>Blue treed a possum in a hollow log</i>

1051
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,515
That's my daddy's song.
My daddy made up that song.

1052
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,160
I don't care who made it up.
Don't nobody want to hear you sing it.

1053
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,834
<i>Come here, woman!</i>

1054
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,631
You come in here carrying on,
I reckon they ain't fired you.

1055
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,677
What they say down there
at the Commissioner's office?

1056
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,798
Look here, Rose.
Mr. Rand called me in his office

1057
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,395
after I got back from
talkin' to them people down there.

1058
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,790
He called me in his office and told me...

1059
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,920
They was making me a driver!

1060
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,433
- Troy, you kidding!
- No, I ain't. Ask Bono.

1061
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,154
That's great, Troy. Now you don't
have to hassle them people no more.

1062
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,358
Oh, hell.
I didn't think I was gonna see you today.

1063
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,920
I thought you was in jail.

1064
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,350
Got it all over the <i>Courier</i>
about them raiding Seefus' place

1065
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,955
where you be hanging out
with all them thugs.

1066
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,679
Hey, Pop,
that ain't got nothing to do with me.

1067
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,075
I don't go down there gambling.

1068
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,038
I just go down there
to sit in with the band.

1069
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,191
I ain't got nothing to do
with the gambling part.

1070
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,794
They got some good music down there.

1071
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,633
They got some rogues is what they got.

1072
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,712
How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.

1073
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,440
I see where you playing down
at the Crawford Grill tonight.

1074
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,040
How come you ain't brought
Bonnie like I told you?

1075
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,110
You shoulda brought Bonnie.

1076
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,520
She ain't been by in a month of Sundays.

1077
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,795
I was just in the neighborhood.

1078
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,280
- Thought I'd stop by.
- Here it comes.

1079
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,596
Your daddy got a promotion on the rubbish.

1080
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,990
He gonna be the first colored driver.

1081
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,874
Ain't got to do nothin' but sit up there and
read the paper, like them white fellas.

1082
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,680
Hey, Pop, if you knew
how to read, you'd be all right.

1083
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,275
Nah, nah. You mean
if the nigger knew how to drive,

1084
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,476
he'd be all right.

1085
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,113
Been fighting with them people about
driving and ain't even got a license.

1086
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,919
Mr. Rand know
you ain't got no driver's license?

1087
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,990
Driving ain't nothing.

1088
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,833
All you do is point the truck
where you want it to go.

1089
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,990
Driving ain't nothing.

1090
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,594
Do they know
you ain't got no driver's license?

1091
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,790
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1092
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,234
I ain't asked if driving was easy.

1093
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,676
I asked if Mr. Rand know
you ain't got no driver's license.

1094
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,830
The man ain't got to know my business.

1095
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,071
Time he find out, I have
two or three of them driver's license.

1096
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,038
- Say, look here, Pop.
- I knew it was coming.

1097
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,032
I knew what kinda "Look here, Pop"
that was.

1098
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,440
Nigger finna ask me for some money.

1099
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,399
It's Friday night, it's my payday.

1100
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,996
All them rogues down on the avenue,
the ones that ain't in jail,

1101
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,800
and Lyons is hopping in his shoes
to get down there with them.

1102
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,916
Now, see, Pop,

1103
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,515
if you gave somebody else
a chance to talk sometime,

1104
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,196
you'd see I was fixing to pay you back
your $10 like I told you.

1105
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,432
Here. I told you I'd pay you
when Bonnie got paid.

1106
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,716
No, you keep that $10. Put it in the bank.

1107
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,393
Next time you feel like
you wanna come by here

1108
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,119
and ask me for somethin',
you go down there and get that.

1109
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,669
Here you go your $10, Pop.

1110
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,553
I told you,
I don't want you to give me nothing.

1111
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,869
I just wanted to borrow $10.

1112
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,520
No, you keep that for the next time
you want to ask me.

1113
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,120
Come on, Pop, here go your $10.

1114
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,272
Troy, why don't you let the boy
pay you back?

1115
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,680
Here you go, Rose. If you don't take it,

1116
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,717
I'm gonna hear about it
for the next six months.

1117
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,439
You can hand yours over, too, Troy.

1118
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,034
You see this, Bono?
You see how they do me?

1119
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,873
Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.

1120
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,311
<i>Better get ready for the Judgment</i>

1121
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,359
<i>Better get ready</i>

1122
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,152
Hey. Hey, there's Troy's boy!

1123
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,560
How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

1124
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,120
Lyons!

1125
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,436
The King of the Jungle!

1126
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,719
Rose. Hey, Rose, I got a flower for you.

1127
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,235
I picked it myself.
That's the same rose like you is.

1128
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,993
That's right nice of you, Gabe.

1129
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,594
What you been doing, Uncle Gabe?

1130
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,151
I been chasing hellhounds
and waiting for the time

1131
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,072
to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates.

1132
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,833
You been chasing hellhounds, huh?

1133
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,639
Well, you doing
the right thing, Uncle Gabe.

1134
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,713
- Somebody's got to chase 'em.
- Yeah, I know it.

1135
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,679
The devil's strong.
The devil ain't no pushover.

1136
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,195
Hellhounds snipping at everybody's heels.

1137
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,875
But I got my trumpet waiting
on the Judgment time.

1138
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,679
Waiting on the Battle of Armageddon, huh?

1139
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,831
Ain't gonna be too much of a battle

1140
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,397
when God get to waving
that Judgment sword.

1141
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,551
But the people's
gonna have a hell of a time

1142
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,200
trying to get into Heaven
if them Gates ain't open.

1143
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,794
You hear this, Pop?

1144
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,556
- Uncle Gabe, you all right.
- Lyons.

1145
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,115
- The King of the Jungle!
- You stayin' for supper, Gabe?

1146
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,270
You want me to fix you a plate?

1147
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,273
I'll just take a sandwich, Rose.
I don't want no plate.

1148
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,477
I want to eat with my hands.
I'll take a sandwich.

1149
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,950
What about you, Lyons? You stayin'?
Got some short ribs cooking.

1150
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,511
Nah. I won't eat nothing
till after we finish playing.

1151
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,152
You ought to come down,
listen to me play, Pop.

1152
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,516
I don't like all that Chinese music,
all that noise.

1153
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,071
Go in there and wash up, Gabe.
I'll fix you a sandwich.

1154
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,800
Troy mad at me.

1155
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,234
What you mad at Uncle Gabe for?

1156
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,154
He think Troy mad at him 'cause
he moved over there to Miss Pearl's.

1157
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,311
I ain't mad at the man.
He can live where he want to live at.

1158
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,551
Well, what he move over there for?
Miss Pearl don't like nobody.

1159
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,393
She don't mind him none.
She treat him real nice.

1160
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,960
She just don't allow all that singing.

1161
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,600
She don't mind that rent he be paying.
That's what she don't mind.

1162
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,194
Troy, I ain't goin' through that
with you no more.

1163
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,078
He moved over there
'cause he wanted his own place.

1164
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,230
He can come and go as he please.

1165
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,437
He can come and go as he please here.
I wasn't stoppin' him.

1166
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,749
I wasn't putting no rules on the man.

1167
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,593
That ain't the same thing,
and you know it.

1168
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,909
Now that's the last
I wanna hear about that.

1169
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,151
I don't wanna hear nothin' else
about Gabe and Miss Pearl.

1170
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,920
- And next week...
- I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.

1171
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,151
And next week, when
that recruiter come from that school,

1172
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,914
I want you to sign that paper
and go on and let Cory play football.

1173
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,719
That'll be the last
I have to hear about that.

1174
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,392
Cory got recruited?
What school he goin' to?

1175
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,113
I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.

1176
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,920
Boy walking around here smelling his piss,
thinking he gonna do what he want to do,

1177
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,276
irregardless of what I say.

1178
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,636
Look here, Bono,
I left the Commissioner's office

1179
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,120
and went down to the A&P.

1180
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,396
That boy ain't workin' down there,
he lied to me.

1181
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,837
Tellin' me he got his job back,
tellin' me he workin' weekend,

1182
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,479
tellin' me he workin' after school.

1183
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,791
Mr. Stawicki says
he ain't working down there at all.

1184
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,075
Cory just growing up.

1185
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,197
He just bustin' at the seams,
tryin' to fill out your shoes.

1186
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,470
I don't care what he doing.

1187
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,631
When he get to the place
where he want to disobey me,

1188
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,872
then it's time for him to move on.
Bono will tell you that.

1189
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,636
I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy
without paying the consequences.

1190
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,996
I ain't never had the chance.

1191
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,676
My daddy came on through,
but I ain't never knew him to see him.

1192
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,355
Or what he had on his mind,
or where he went.

1193
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,116
Just moving on through.
Searching out the New Land.

1194
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,310
That's what the old folks used to call it.

1195
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,837
See a fella moving around
from place to place, woman to woman,

1196
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,310
they call it "Searching out the New Land."

1197
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,039
I can't say if he ever found it.

1198
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,269
I come along, didn't want no kids.

1199
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,752
I didn't know if I was gonna
be in one place long enough

1200
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,832
to fix on 'em right as their daddy.

1201
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,037
I figured I was going searching, too.

1202
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,351
As it turn out,
I been hooked up with Lucille

1203
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,830
for near about as long as
your daddy been with Rose.

1204
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,071
Going on 16 years.

1205
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,038
Sometimes, I wish
I'd never known my daddy.

1206
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,875
He ain't cared nothing about no kids.
A kid to him wasn't nothing.

1207
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,432
All he wanted you to do
was learn how to walk,

1208
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,193
so he could start you to working.

1209
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,035
Come to eating, he ate first.
Anything left over, that's what you got.

1210
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,192
Man would sit down, eat two chickens,
and give you the wing.

1211
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,557
You ought to stop that, Pop.
Everybody feed their kids.

1212
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,758
No matter how hard times is,
everybody care about their kids.

1213
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,035
Make sure they have something to eat.

1214
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,873
Only thing my daddy cared about

1215
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,713
was getting them bales
of cotton in to Mr. Lubin.

1216
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,837
That's the only thing
that mattered to him.

1217
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,071
Sometimes, I used to wonder
why he was still living,

1218
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,720
why the devil hadn't come and got him.

1219
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,872
"Get them bales of cotton
in to Mr. Lubin."

1220
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,314
Find out he owe him money.

1221
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,596
He should have just went on and left
when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.

1222
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,716
That's what I would've done.

1223
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,713
How he gonna leave with 11 kids?
And where he gonna go?

1224
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,998
He ain't knew nothing but how to farm.
No, he was trapped.

1225
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,552
I think he knew it, too.
But I'll say this for him...

1226
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,393
He felt a responsibility toward us.

1227
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,472
May not have treated us
like I felt he should have,

1228
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,474
but without that responsibility,
he could have run off and left us,

1229
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,920
made his own way.

1230
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,400
A lot of them did.

1231
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,073
Back in those days,
what you talkin' about?

1232
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,799
They walk out their front door

1233
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,078
and take off down one road or another
and just keep on walkin'.

1234
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,072
There you go.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1235
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,517
Just keep on walking
till they come to something else.

1236
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,911
Ain't you never heard of nobody
having the walking blues?

1237
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,469
Now, that's what you call it
when you just take off like that.

1238
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,431
My daddy ain't had no walking blues.
What you talking about?

1239
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,000
He stayed right there with his family,

1240
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,754
but he was just as evil as he could be!

1241
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,510
My mama couldn't stand him.
Couldn't stand that evilness.

1242
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,593
She run off when I was about eight.

1243
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,838
She sneaked off one night,
told me she was coming back for me.

1244
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,639
I ain't never seen her no more.

1245
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,839
All his women run off and left him.
He wasn't good for nobody.

1246
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,033
My turn come to head out.

1247
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,474
I was 14,

1248
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,439
got to sniffing around
Joe Canewell's daughter.

1249
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,110
We had this old mule called "Greyboy".

1250
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,357
My daddy sent me out to do some plowing.

1251
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,116
I got to fooling around
with Joe Canewell's daughter.

1252
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,398
Found us a nice spot,
got real cozy with each other.

1253
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,678
She was about 13,
so we done figured we grown anyway.

1254
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,150
So, we were down there by
the creek, enjoying ourselves,

1255
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,640
ain't thinking about nothing.

1256
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,030
Didn't know Greyboy had gotten loose,

1257
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,557
wandered back to the house,
and my daddy was lookin' for me.

1258
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,311
So, we down there enjoying ourselves
when he come up on us.

1259
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,471
Surprised us.

1260
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,115
Had them leather straps off that mule,

1261
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,238
commenced to whupping me
like there was no tomorrow.

1262
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,915
I jump up. I'm mad, embarrassed.

1263
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,717
I was scared of my daddy.

1264
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,912
Now, when he commenced to whipping on me,

1265
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,719
quite naturally,
I run to get out of the way.

1266
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,474
Now, I think he's mad
'cause I ain't done my work.

1267
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:58,191
But I see where he's chasing me off,
so he can have the gal for himself.

1268
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,717
When I see what the matter of it was,

1269
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,879
I lost all fear of my daddy,
and right there, I became a man.

1270
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,350
Fourteen years of age.

1271
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,353
Now, it's my turn to run him off.

1272
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,238
I picked up them same reins he used on me.

1273
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,916
I picked up them reins,
I commenced to whupping on him.

1274
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,270
Gal jump up, she run off.

1275
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,429
When he turned to face me,

1276
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,398
I knew why the devil
never come and get him

1277
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,631
'cause he was the devil himself.

1278
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,520
I don't know what happened.

1279
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,798
I woke up, laying there by the creek,

1280
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,556
and Blue, this old dog we had,
he was licking my face.

1281
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,678
Both my eyes were swoll shut.

1282
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,592
I thought I was blind,
I couldn't see nothing.

1283
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,390
I just laid there and cried.

1284
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,873
And I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1285
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,398
But I knew the time had come
for me to leave my daddy's house.

1286
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,990
Suddenly, the world got big, and...

1287
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,994
It was a long time before I could
cut it down to where I could handle it.

1288
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,514
Part of that cutting down
was where I got to the place

1289
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,592
where I could feel him
kicking in my blood,

1290
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,273
and I knew the only thing
that separated us

1291
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,477
was a matter of a few years.

1292
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,874
What you got there, Uncle Gabe?

1293
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,314
I got me a ham sandwich.

1294
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,551
Rose gave me a ham sandwich.

1295
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,191
I lost touch with everybody
except Gabriel.

1296
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,190
But...

1297
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,712
I hope he's dead.

1298
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,634
I hope he found some peace.

1299
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,757
That's a heavy story, Pop.

1300
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,949
I didn't know you left home
when you was 14.

1301
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,117
Fourteen's kinda young to be on your own.

1302
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,078
I don't know what I would've done.

1303
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,639
Well, I got up from that creek,
walked on down to Mobile.

1304
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,396
I was through with farming.
I figured I'd do better in the cities.

1305
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,312
So, I walked the 200 miles to Mobile.

1306
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,996
Wait a minute,
you ain't walked no 200 miles, Pop.

1307
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:23,154
Ain't nobody gonna walk no 200 miles.
You talking about some walking there!

1308
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,994
That's the only way you got anywhere
back in them days.

1309
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,914
Shit! Damn if I wouldn't have
hitched a ride with somebody.

1310
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,673
Who you gonna hitch it with?

1311
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,558
There ain't no cars
and things like they got now.

1312
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,279
We talking about 1918.

1313
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,919
What you all out here gettin' into?

1314
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,196
I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.

1315
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,555
He don't know nothing
about this I'm talking.

1316
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,394
Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.
She says you supposed to pick her up.

1317
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,233
Yeah, okay, Rose.

1318
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,040
I walked on down to Mobile,

1319
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,397
hitched up with some fellows
that was coming up this way.

1320
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,119
Got up here and found out,

1321
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,714
not only could you not get a job,

1322
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,354
you couldn't find no place to live.

1323
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,080
I thought I was in freedom.

1324
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,750
Colored folks living down there
on the riverbanks

1325
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,071
in whatever kind of shelter
they could find for themselves.

1326
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,629
Right down there
under the Brady Street Bridge.

1327
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,351
Living down there in shacks
made out of sticks and tar paper.

1328
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,119
Messed around down there.

1329
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,715
Went from bad to worse. Started stealing.

1330
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,395
First, it was food.
Then I figure I steal me some money,

1331
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,949
I can buy me some food,
buy me some shoes, too.

1332
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,033
One thing led to another. Met your mama.

1333
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,790
I was young, anxious to be a man.

1334
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,716
I met your mama and had you.
Why'd I do that for?

1335
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,235
Now, I got to worry about
feeding you and her.

1336
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,800
Got to steal three times as much.

1337
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,031
I went out one day
looking for somebody to rob.

1338
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,435
That's what I was, I was a robber.

1339
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,753
I'mma tell you the truth.

1340
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,752
I'm ashamed of it today,
but it's the truth.

1341
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,678
I went to rob this fella,
I pull out my knife.

1342
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,911
He pulled out a gun, shot me in the chest.

1343
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,232
It felt like somebody had taken
a hot branding iron and laid it on me.

1344
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,358
Now, when he shot me,
I jumped at him with my knife,

1345
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,072
and they say I killed him.

1346
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,231
Locked me up, put me in
the penitentiary for 15 years.

1347
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,674
That's where I met Bono.

1348
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,516
Where I learned how to play baseball.

1349
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,114
Got out that place,
and your mama had taken you,

1350
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,192
went on to make a life without me.

1351
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,351
Fifteen years was a long time
for her to wait.

1352
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,318
But that 15 years
cured me of that robbing stuff.

1353
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,754
Rose'll tell you.

1354
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,116
I first met her, she ask me if I had

1355
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,351
gotten all that foolishness
out of my system.

1356
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,272
I said, "Baby, it's you and baseball,

1357
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,079
"all what count to me." You hear me, Bono?

1358
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,800
And I meant it, too.
She said, "Which one come first?"

1359
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,952
I said, "Well, ain't no doubt it's baseball.

1360
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,997
"But you stick and get old with me,

1361
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,639
"and we'll both outlive this baseball."

1362
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,837
Am I right, Rose?

1363
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,110
And it's true.

1364
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,953
Man, hush your mouth.
You ain't say no such thing.

1365
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,635
Talkin' about, "Baby, you know
you'll always be number one with me."

1366
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,315
That's what you was talking.

1367
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,869
- That's why I love this woman.
- Rose will keep you straight.

1368
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,077
You get off the track,
she'll straighten you up.

1369
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,514
Lyons, you better get on up
and get Bonnie.

1370
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,080
She waiting on you.

1371
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,435
- Hey, Pop.
- Yeah?

1372
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,557
You ought to come down to the Grill,
hear me play.

1373
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,919
Man, I ain't goin' down there.

1374
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,434
I'm too old to be hanging out
in them clubs.

1375
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,797
You got to be good to
play down at the Grill.

1376
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,360
Come on, Pop.

1377
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,229
- I got to get up in the morning.
- Well, you ain't gotta stay long.

1378
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,916
No, I'm gonna eat my supper and go to bed.

1379
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,834
Well, I got to go. I'll see you later.

1380
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,636
Don't you come by my house on my payday!

1381
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,111
And pick up the phone,
let somebody know you coming,

1382
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,197
and bring Bonnie,
you know I'm always glad to see her.

1383
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,751
I'll do that, Rose. You take care now.

1384
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,354
- See you, Pop.
- All right.

1385
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,511
See you, Mr. Bono.

1386
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,638
- See you, Uncle Gabe!
- Lyons! King of the Jungle!

1387
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,075
Supper ready, woman?

1388
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,674
Me and you got some business
to take care of.

1389
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,076
- I'mma tear it up, too.
- Troy, I done told you now!

1390
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,313
Hell, woman, it's Bono. Bono like family.
I done know this nigger since...

1391
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,869
- How long have I known you?
- It's been a long time.

1392
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,350
I done known this nigger
since Skippy was a pup!

1393
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,272
Me and him done been through some times!

1394
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,033
You sure are right about that.

1395
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,112
Hell, I known him
longer than I known you, Rose,

1396
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,032
and we still standin'
shoulder to shoulder.

1397
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,511
Look here, Bono,
a man can't ask for no more than that.

1398
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,829
I love you, nigger.

1399
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,877
Hell! I love you, too.

1400
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,953
But I got to get home, see my woman.
You got yours in hand.

1401
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,794
I got to go get mine.

1402
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,638
What you do that for, Pop?

1403
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,074
What's the matter?
Cory, what's the matter?

1404
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,913
Pop done went up to the school
and told Coach Zellman

1405
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,150
I can't play football no more.

1406
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,754
Wouldn't even let me play the game.

1407
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,360
Told him to tell the recruiter
not to come.

1408
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,238
- Troy.
- What you Troying me for?

1409
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,913
Yeah, I did it.
And the boy knows why I did it.

1410
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,878
Why you wanna do that to me?
That was the one chance I had!

1411
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,394
Ain't nothing wrong
with Cory playing football, Troy.

1412
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,630
The boy lied to me.

1413
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,235
I told the nigger,
"You want to play football,

1414
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,595
"you keep up with your chores

1415
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,195
"hold that job down at the A&P."
That was the conditions.

1416
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,760
I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...

1417
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,560
I can't work after school
during the football season, Pop.

1418
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,791
I tried to tell you
Mr. Stawicki was holding my job for me.

1419
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,595
You don't never want to listen to nobody,
and then you wanna go and do this to me?

1420
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,239
I ain't done nothin' to you.
You done it to yourself.

1421
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,913
Just 'cause you didn't get a chance!

1422
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,992
You're just scared
I'm gonna be better than you, that's all!

1423
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,029
- Come here.
- Troy.

1424
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,710
Troy.

1425
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,040
Pick it up.

1426
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,679
Put it on.

1427
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,278
Strap it up.

1428
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,234
All right.

1429
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,553
See, you done made a mistake.

1430
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,280
- I didn't even do nothing!
- I'll tell you what your mistake was.

1431
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,630
You swung at the ball
and you didn't hit it.

1432
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:50,390
That's strike one.
You in the batter's box now.

1433
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,600
You swung and you missed, see?

1434
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,069
That's strike one.

1435
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,033
Don't you strike out.

1436
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,994
Cory, why don't you come on in here,
help me clean out these cupboards.

1437
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,437
I ain't quitting the team.
I don't care what Papa says.

1438
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,671
I'll talk to him when he get back.

1439
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,440
He had to go see about your Uncle Gabe.

1440
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,795
Police done arrested him again.

1441
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,593
Said he was disturbing the peace.

1442
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,034
He'll be back directly.

1443
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,680
Come on in here and help me
clean out these cupboards.

1444
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,029
Come on.

1445
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,238
Troy, what they say down there?

1446
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,631
They ain't said nothing.
I give them $50, they let him go.

1447
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,598
I'll talk to you about it.

1448
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,670
Where Cory?

1449
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,070
He in the house,
helping me clean out these cupboards.

1450
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,032
All right, tell him to get his butt out here.

1451
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,517
All they want is the money.

1452
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,796
This makes six, seven times,
I done went down there and got him.

1453
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,111
See me coming, they stick out their hands.

1454
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,954
Yeah, I know what you mean.
That's all they care about, that money.

1455
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,111
They don't care about what's right.

1456
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,952
Nigger, why you got to go
and get some hardwood?

1457
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,316
You ain't doing nothin'
but building a little old fence.

1458
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,312
Get you some soft pinewood.
That's all you need.

1459
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,993
I know what I'm doing. This outside wood.

1460
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,311
You put pinewood inside the house.

1461
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,472
Pinewood inside wood.
This here the outside wood.

1462
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,756
Now tell me, where the fence gonna be?

1463
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,958
You don't need this wood.

1464
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,520
You can put it up with pinewood,

1465
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,876
and it'll stand as long as
you gonna be here looking at it.

1466
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,440
How you know
how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?

1467
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,193
Hell, I might live forever.

1468
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,875
I'll live longer than old man Horsely.

1469
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,679
That's what Magee used to say.

1470
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,116
Magee a damn fool.
Now you tell me who you ever heard of

1471
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,238
gonna pull their own teeth
with a pair of rusty pliers?

1472
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,436
They're old folks.

1473
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,432
My granddaddy used to
pull his teeth with pliers.

1474
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,637
They ain't had no dentists
for colored folk back then.

1475
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,275
Well, get clean pliers.
You understand? Clean pliers.

1476
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,920
Sterilize them.
Besides, we ain't living back then.

1477
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,159
All he had to do
was go down to Doc Goldblum's.

1478
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,800
I see where you and
that Tallahassee gal, that Alberta,

1479
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,397
see where you all done got tight.

1480
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,755
What you mean, "got tight"?

1481
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,877
I see where you be laughing
and joking with her all the time.

1482
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,680
I laugh and joke with 'em all.
Bono, you know me.

1483
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,752
Ain't the kind of laughing and joking
I'm talking about.

1484
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,880
How you doing, Mr. Bono?

1485
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,679
Cory, get that saw from Bono
and cut some wood.

1486
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,195
He talking about wood too hard to cut.

1487
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,873
Stand back there, Jim.

1488
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,229
Let the young boy show you how it's done.

1489
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,471
He's sure welcome to it.

1490
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,113
Look at that.
Big, ol' strong boy, looks like Joe Louis.

1491
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,800
Hell, I must be getting old

1492
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,837
the way I'm watching that boy
whip through that wood.

1493
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,430
I don't see why Mama
wants a fence around no yard no way.

1494
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,596
Damn if I know, either.

1495
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,751
I don't know what the hell
she keeping out with it.

1496
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,832
She ain't got nothing nobody wants.

1497
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,958
Some people build fences
to keep people out,

1498
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,350
and other people build fences
to keep people in.

1499
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,630
Rose wants to hold on to you all.
She loves you.

1500
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,353
Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody
to tell me my wife loves me.

1501
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,911
Cory, go in the house
and see if you can find the other saw.

1502
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,679
Where's it at?

1503
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,559
I said find it. Look for it till you find it.

1504
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,751
What is that supposed to mean?
Want to keep us in?

1505
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,436
Troy,

1506
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,790
I done known you seem like
damn near my whole life.

1507
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,634
You and Rose both.
I known both of you all for a long time.

1508
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,189
I remember when you met Rose.

1509
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,239
When you was hitting them baseball
out of the park.

1510
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,831
A lot of them old gals was after you then.

1511
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,917
You had the pick of the litter.

1512
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,596
When you picked Rose, I was happy for you.

1513
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,871
That's the first time
I knew you had any sense.

1514
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,153
I said, "My man Troy
knows what he's doing.

1515
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,392
"I'm gonna follow this nigger,
he might take me somewhere."

1516
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,837
I been following you, too.

1517
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,470
I done learned a whole heap of things
about life watching you.

1518
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,192
I done learned how to tell
where the shit lies.

1519
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,596
How to tell it from the alfalfa.

1520
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,789
You done learned me a lot of things.

1521
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,475
Showed me how to not
make the same mistakes.

1522
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,758
To take life as it come along,

1523
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,514
keep putting one foot
in front of the other.

1524
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,640
- Rose is a good woman, Troy.
- I know she a good woman.

1525
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,234
I've been married to her for 18 years.

1526
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,674
What you got on your mind, Bono?

1527
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,150
I just say she's a good woman,
like I say anything.

1528
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,560
I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.

1529
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,076
You just say she a good woman and
leave it hanging out there like that?

1530
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,230
Why are you telling me she a good woman?

1531
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,154
She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.

1532
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,435
You saying I don't measure up?

1533
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,789
That's what you tryin' to say.

1534
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,599
I don't measure up
'cause I'm seeing this other gal.

1535
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,830
I know what you tryin' to say.

1536
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,071
I know what Rose means to you, Troy.

1537
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:20,119
I'm just tryin' to say
I don't want to see you mess up.

1538
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,315
Yeah.

1539
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,674
Well, I appreciate that, Bono.

1540
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,396
If you was messing around on Lucille,
I'd be telling you the same thing.

1541
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,994
That's all I got to say.

1542
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,999
I just say that 'cause I love you both.

1543
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,033
Yeah.

1544
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,349
You know me.
I wasn't out there looking for nothing.

1545
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,875
You can't find a better woman
than Rose, I know that.

1546
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,034
But it seems like this woman
just stuck on to me

1547
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,270
where I can't shake her loose.

1548
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:58,475
I done wrestled with it and tried to throw
her off, but now she stuck on tighter.

1549
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,870
And now she stuck on for good.

1550
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,714
You's in control.
That's what you tell me all the time.

1551
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,553
You responsible for what you do.

1552
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,393
I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.

1553
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,870
As long as it set right in my heart,
then I'm okay.

1554
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,873
'Cause that's all I listen to.
It tell me right and wrong every time.

1555
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,792
And I ain't talking about
doing Rose no bad turn.

1556
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,314
I love Rose.

1557
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,959
She done carried me a long ways,

1558
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,394
and I love and respect her for that.

1559
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,630
I know you do.

1560
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,837
That's why I don't want
to see you hurt her.

1561
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,310
But what you gonna do when she finds out?

1562
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,831
What you got then?

1563
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,320
You try to juggle both of them,

1564
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,153
sooner or later,
you gonna drop one of them.

1565
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,436
- That's common sense.
- I know what you're saying, Bono.

1566
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,197
I been trying to figure a way
to work it out.

1567
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,317
Work it out right, Troy.

1568
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,080
I ain't trying to get all up
between you and Rose's business,

1569
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,356
but work it, so it come out right.

1570
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,671
Hell, I get all between
you and Lucille's business.

1571
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,274
And when you gonna buy that woman

1572
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,714
that refrigerator she be wanting?

1573
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,473
And don't tell me you ain't got no money.

1574
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,835
I know who your banker is.

1575
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,435
Mellon don't need that money
as bad as Lucille wants that refrigerator.

1576
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,510
I know that.

1577
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,716
- Tell you what I'll do.
- What?

1578
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,792
When you finish building
this fence for Rose,

1579
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,519
I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.

1580
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,479
You done stuck your foot
in your mouth now.

1581
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,193
Hey, nigger, where you going?

1582
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,509
I'm going home.

1583
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,432
I know you don't expect me
to help you now.

1584
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:11,954
I'm protecting my money.

1585
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,353
I want to see you put
that fence up by yourself.

1586
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,033
That's what I want to see.

1587
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,351
You'll be here
another six months without me.

1588
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,800
Nigger, you ain't right.

1589
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,553
When it come to my money,

1590
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,712
I'm right as fireworks
on the Fourth of July.

1591
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,952
We gonna see.
You better get out your bank book!

1592
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,071
What they say down there?
What's happening with Gabe?

1593
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,119
I went down there
and got him out. Cost me $50.

1594
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,634
Said he was disturbing the peace.

1595
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,155
Judge set up a hearing for him
in three weeks

1596
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,835
to show cause
why he shouldn't be recommitted.

1597
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,593
What'd you say? What'd you tell the judge?

1598
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,639
I told him I'd take care of him.

1599
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,279
It didn't make no sense
to recommit the man.

1600
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,760
He stuck out his big greasy palm,

1601
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,514
told me to give him $50
and take him on home.

1602
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,512
Where's he at now? Where'd he go off to?

1603
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,512
Gone about his business.
He don't need nobody to hold his hand.

1604
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,796
Well, I don't know, seem like that
would be the best place for him.

1605
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:49,870
To put him in a hospital.

1606
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,560
I know what you gonna say,
but that's what I think would be best.

1607
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,279
Man had his life ruined fighting for what?

1608
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,589
Now, they want to take him
and lock him up?

1609
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:57,990
Let him be free.
Man ain't bothering nobody.

1610
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,913
Everybody got their own way
of looking at it, I guess.

1611
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,269
Come on, get your lunch.

1612
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,953
I got some lima beans
and cornbread in the oven.

1613
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,110
Come on, get somethin' to eat.

1614
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,793
Ain't no sense in you fretting over Gabe.

1615
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,115
Rose, I got something to tell you.

1616
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,074
- Wait till I put the food on the table.
- Rose...

1617
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,754
Now, I don't know how to tell you this.

1618
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,717
And I can't explain it none.

1619
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,952
It just sort of grows on you.

1620
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,477
It started off like a little bush,
next thing you know, it's a whole forest.

1621
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,758
- Troy, what is you talking about?
- I'm talking, woman. Let me talk.

1622
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,638
I'm trying to tell you,

1623
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,155
find a way to tell you that

1624
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,550
I'm gonna be a daddy.

1625
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,996
Yeah, I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.

1626
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,314
Troy, you ain't telling me this.
You're gonna be what?

1627
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,720
- You're gonna be somebody's daddy?
- Rose...

1628
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,870
You're telling your wife this?

1629
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,996
Now...

1630
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,311
Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose!

1631
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,995
I got to wait 18 years
to hear something like this?

1632
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,309
Hey, Rose.

1633
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,596
I got a flower for you.

1634
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,830
That's a rose. The same rose like you is.

1635
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,274
Thanks, Gabe.

1636
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,760
Troy, you ain't mad at me?

1637
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,274
Them bad mens come and put me away.

1638
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,750
- You ain't mad at me?
- No. No, I ain't mad at you.

1639
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,752
Eighteen years,
and you want to come with this?

1640
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,520
See what I got? Got a brand-new quarter.

1641
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,510
Rose, it's just that...

1642
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,796
Ain't nothing you can say, Troy.
Ain't no explaining it.

1643
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,520
The fella that give me this quarter
had a whole mess of 'em!

1644
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,109
I'm gonna keep this quarter
till it stops shining.

1645
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,760
Gabe, go on up front now.
I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire.

1646
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,990
Go on. I'll get you a piece.

1647
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,800
Say, Rose, you know,
I was chasing hellhounds,

1648
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,793
and them bad mens come
and get me and take me away.

1649
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,872
Troy helped me.
He come down there and told them

1650
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,873
they better let me go
before he beat them up!

1651
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,235
Yeah, he did!

1652
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,596
Go up front now, Gabe.
I'll get you some watermelon.

1653
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,160
Them bad men is gone now.

1654
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:08,596
Okay. Rose gonna give me some watermelon,

1655
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,149
the kind with the stripes on it.

1656
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,074
Why, Troy?

1657
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,069
Why?

1658
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:26,599
After all these years,
you come dragging this in to me now?

1659
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,831
It don't make no sense at your age.

1660
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,309
I could've expected this 10,
or 15 years ago, but not now.

1661
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,831
Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.

1662
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,197
I done tried to be everything
a wife should be.

1663
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,475
Everything a wife could be.

1664
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,835
I've been married 18 years,

1665
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,435
and now,
I got to live to see the day you tell me

1666
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,036
you been seeing another woman
and done fathered a child by her.

1667
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,194
And you know I never wanted
no half-nothing in my family!

1668
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,475
My whole family is half.

1669
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,392
Everybody got different
fathers and mothers

1670
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,960
and my two sisters and my brothers.

1671
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,633
You could hardly tell who's who.

1672
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,473
Could never sit down
and talk about Papa and Mama.

1673
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,200
It was always your papa,
your mama, my papa, my mama.

1674
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,795
And I ain't never wanted that
for none of my children!

1675
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,396
And now, you want to drag your behind
in here and tell me something like this!

1676
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,437
Stop it now. You ought to know.
It's time for you to know.

1677
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,239
Well, I don't want to know, God damn it!

1678
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,310
Rose?

1679
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,831
I just can't make it go away.
It's done now.

1680
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,834
I can't wish the circumstances
of the thing away.

1681
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,595
And you don't want to, either.

1682
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,478
Maybe you want to wish me and my boy away.

1683
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,914
Maybe that's what you want.

1684
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,509
Well, you can't wish us away.

1685
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,557
I got 18 years of my life invested in you.

1686
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,677
You ought to have stayed upstairs
in my bed where you belong.

1687
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,355
Now, listen to me.
We can get a handle on this thing.

1688
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,272
We can talk this out,
come to an understanding.

1689
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,589
All of a sudden it's "we."

1690
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,949
Where was "we" at
when you were down there,

1691
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,360
rolling around
with some godforsaken woman?

1692
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,274
"We" should've come to an understanding before
you started making a damn fool of yourself!

1693
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,234
You're a day late and a dollar short when
it comes to an understanding with me.

1694
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:39,078
Rose, it's just that
she gives me a different idea.

1695
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,752
A different understanding about myself.

1696
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,311
I can step out of this house
and get away from the pressures

1697
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,754
and the problems, be a different man.

1698
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,638
I ain't got to worry about
how I'll get the roof fixed,

1699
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,359
or pay the bills, or...

1700
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,760
I can just

1701
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,315
be a part of myself
I ain't never been before.

1702
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,671
What I want to know is...

1703
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,669
What I want to know

1704
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,440
is do you plan to continue seeing her?

1705
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,830
That's all you can say to me.

1706
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,194
I could sit up in her house and laugh.
You understand what I'm saying?

1707
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,875
I could laugh out loud, and it feels good.

1708
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,191
It reaches all the way down
to the bottom of my shoes.

1709
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,475
Rose, I...

1710
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,679
I can't give that up.

1711
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,631
Well, maybe you ought to go on
and stay down there with her,

1712
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,393
if she's a better woman than me.

1713
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,233
It ain't about nobody being
a better woman, or nothing.

1714
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,640
Rose, you ain't to blame.

1715
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,996
A man couldn't ask
for a better wife than you've been.

1716
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,560
I'm responsible for it.

1717
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,199
I done locked myself into a pattern,

1718
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,272
trying to take care of you all,
that I forgot about myself.

1719
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,999
Well, what the hell was I there for?

1720
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,639
That was my job, not somebody else's.

1721
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,838
Rose, listen to me.
I done tried all my life to live decent.

1722
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,833
To live a clean, hard, useful life.

1723
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,072
I try to be a good husband to you,
in every way I know how.

1724
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,356
Maybe I come into the world backwards,
I don't know,

1725
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,751
but you're born with two strikes on you
before you come to the plate.

1726
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,956
You got to guard it closely,

1727
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,680
always looking for the curveball
on the inside corner.

1728
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,399
You can't afford a called strike.

1729
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,834
You can't let nothing get past you.

1730
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,037
If you're going down,
you're doing down swinging.

1731
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,840
Everything lined up against you!

1732
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,034
What you gonna do?

1733
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,075
I fooled them, Rose. I bunted.

1734
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:30,355
When I found you and Cory
and a halfway decent job, I was safe.

1735
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,636
Couldn't nothing touch me!

1736
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,154
I wasn't gonna strike out no more.

1737
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,640
I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.

1738
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,076
I wasn't gonna lie in the street
with a bottle of wine.

1739
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,439
I was safe. I had me a family, a job.

1740
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,314
I wasn't gonna get that last strike.

1741
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,959
I was standing on first base,

1742
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,997
waiting for one of them boys
to knock me in, to bring me home.

1743
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,878
You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.

1744
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,394
Then I saw the gal,
she firmed up my backbone.

1745
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,439
I got to thinkin' that if I tried,
maybe I could steal second.

1746
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,000
- You understand?
- You should've held me tight.

1747
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,471
- You should've grabbed me and held on.
- I stood on first base for 18 years,

1748
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,950
and I thought, well,
God damn it, go on for it!

1749
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,430
We ain't talking about baseball!

1750
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,830
We talking about you going off
and laying up with another woman,

1751
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:12,910
then bringing it home to me.

1752
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,276
That's what we're talking about.
We're not talkin' about no baseball!

1753
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,510
Rose, you're not listening to me.

1754
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,519
I'm trying to explain it to you
the best way I know how.

1755
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:25,552
It's not easy for me to admit that I've been
standing in the same place for 18 years!

1756
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,155
Well, I've been standing with you!

1757
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:32,280
I've been right here with you, Troy!
I got a life, too.

1758
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,593
I gave 18 years of my life
to stand in the same spot as you!

1759
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,637
Don't you think
I ever wanted other things?

1760
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,837
Don't you think I had dreams and hopes?

1761
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,515
What about my life? What about me?

1762
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,190
Don't you think it ever crossed my
mind to want to know other men?

1763
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:50,593
That I wanted to lay up somewhere
and forget about my responsibilities?

1764
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,273
That I wanted someone to make me laugh,

1765
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,397
so I could feel good?

1766
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,551
You're not the only one
who's got wants and needs.

1767
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,592
But I held on to you, Troy.

1768
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:02,833
I took all my feelings,
my wants and needs and dreams,

1769
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,718
and I buried them inside you.

1770
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,076
I planted a seed
and watched and prayed over it.

1771
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,153
I planted myself inside you
and waited to bloom!

1772
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:14,075
And it didn't take me no 18 years
to realize the soil was hard and rocky,

1773
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,277
and it wasn't never gonna bloom!

1774
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,273
But I held on to you, Troy.
I held you tighter.

1775
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,352
You was my husband.

1776
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,080
I owed you everything I had.

1777
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,834
Every part of me I could find to give you.

1778
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,749
And upstairs in that bedroom,
with the darkness falling in on me,

1779
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,954
I gave everything I had
to try and erase the doubt

1780
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,714
that you wasn't the finest man
in the world.

1781
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,474
And wherever you was going,
I was gonna be there with you,

1782
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,035
because you was my husband.

1783
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,473
'Cause that's the only way
I was gonna survive as your wife.

1784
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:52,396
You always talking about what you give
and what you don't have to give.

1785
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,799
But you take, too, Troy.

1786
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,520
You take and
don't even know nobody's giving.

1787
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,590
You say I take and don't give.

1788
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,830
Troy, you're hurting me.

1789
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,832
- Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!
- I gave you everything I got.

1790
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,195
Don't you tell that lie on me.

1791
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,680
- Mama!
- Don't you tell that lie!

1792
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,274
Troy, you're hurting me!

1793
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,234
Troy! Troy!

1794
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,316
All right. That's strike two.

1795
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:17,359
You stay away from around me, boy.
Don't you strike out.

1796
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,032
You're living with a full count.

1797
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,398
Don't you strike out!

1798
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,712
Troy, I want to talk to you.

1799
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,431
All of a sudden?

1800
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,949
After all this time,
you want to talk to me, huh?

1801
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,520
You ain't wanted to talk to me in months.

1802
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:01,920
You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.

1803
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,480
You didn't want no parts of me then.

1804
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,112
What you want to talk to me about now?

1805
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,719
- Tomorrow's Friday.
- I know what day tomorrow is.

1806
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,950
You think I don't know tomorrow's Friday?

1807
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,231
My whole life, I ain't done nothing
but look to see Friday coming,

1808
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,640
and you got to tell me it's Friday.

1809
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,234
I want to know if you're coming home.

1810
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,235
I always come home, Rose. You know that.

1811
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,674
Ain't never been a night
I ain't come home.

1812
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,439
That ain't what I mean, and you know it.

1813
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:29,077
I wanna know if you're coming
straight home after work.

1814
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:32,119
I figured I'd cash my check,
hang out at Taylors' with the boys.

1815
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,316
Maybe play a game of checkers.

1816
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,995
Troy, I can't live like this.
I won't live like this.

1817
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,480
You're living on borrowed time with me.

1818
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,552
Been going on six months now,
you ain't been coming home.

1819
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,677
I come home every night.
Every night of the year.

1820
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,229
That's 365 days.

1821
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,355
I want you to come home
tomorrow after work.

1822
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:57,036
Rose, I don't mess up my pay.
You know that.

1823
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,998
I take my pay, I give it to you.

1824
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,437
I don't have no money
but what you give me back.

1825
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,672
I just want a little time to myself.

1826
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,950
A little time to enjoy life.

1827
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,918
What about me?
When's my time to enjoy life?

1828
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,071
I don't know what to tell you, Rose.
I'm doing the best I can.

1829
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,196
You ain't been comin' home from work,

1830
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,634
but time enough
to change your clothes and run out.

1831
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:15,712
You wanna call that the best you can do?

1832
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,352
I'm going over to the hospital
to see Alberta.

1833
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,153
She went into the hospital this afternoon.

1834
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:26,677
Looks like she might have the baby early.

1835
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:29,233
I won't be gone long.

1836
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:38,709
Well, you ought to know. They went over
to Miss Pearl's and got Gabe today.

1837
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,555
She said you told them to
go ahead and lock him up.

1838
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:46,600
I ain't said no such thing.
Whoever told you that is telling a lie.

1839
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,399
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing
but telling a big, fat lie.

1840
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,358
She ain't had to tell me.
I read it on the papers.

1841
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,557
- What'd it say, huh?
- It said you told them to take him.

1842
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,831
Then they screwed that up,
just like they screw up everything.

1843
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,149
I ain't worried about
what they got on that paper.

1844
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,152
It say the government sends
part of the check to the hospital,

1845
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,310
the other part to you.

1846
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,039
I got nothing to do with that,
if that's the way it works.

1847
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,236
I don't make up the rules...

1848
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,595
You did Gabe just like you did Cory.

1849
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,875
You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory,

1850
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,599
but you signed for Gabe!
You signed that paper!

1851
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,512
I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman.

1852
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,159
Hell, the only thing I signed
was the release form.

1853
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,270
Hell, I can't read,

1854
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,680
I don't know what they had on that paper.

1855
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,592
I ain't signed nothing
about sending Gabe away.

1856
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,831
I said send him to the hospital,
you said let him go free.

1857
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:17,910
Then you went down there

1858
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,474
and you signed him to the hospital
for half his money.

1859
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,836
You went back on yourself, Troy.
You're gonna have to answer for that.

1860
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,519
You just been over there
talking to Miss Pearl.

1861
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,160
She just mad 'cause she ain't gettin'
Gabe's rent money, that's all it is.

1862
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:27,674
Troy, I seen where you signed the paper!

1863
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,876
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1864
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,634
And what she doing got papers
on my brother for, anyway?

1865
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,396
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing
but telling a big, fat lie,

1866
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,312
and I'm gonna tell her about it, too!

1867
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,795
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1868
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,880
Say...

1869
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,911
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1870
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,080
Troy.

1871
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,914
Troy.

1872
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,999
That was the hospital.
Alberta had the baby.

1873
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,035
Yeah? What she have? What is it?

1874
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:08,600
It's a girl.

1875
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,999
I...

1876
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,271
I better get on down there to see her.

1877
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,110
Troy.

1878
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,114
I got to go see her now, Rose.
That's only right.

1879
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,717
What's the matter?
Baby all right, ain't it?

1880
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,998
Alberta died having the baby.

1881
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,232
She died? You say she's dead?

1882
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,720
Alberta dead?

1883
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,870
They said they done
all they could. They...

1884
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,754
They couldn't do nothing for her.

1885
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,751
What about the baby? Baby all right?

1886
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,751
They say it's healthy.

1887
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,514
I wonder who's gonna bury her.

1888
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,636
She had a family, Rose.

1889
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,200
She wasn't living in the world by herself.

1890
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,556
I know she wasn't living
in the world by herself.

1891
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,040
Next thing you wanna know
if she had any insurance.

1892
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,440
You ain't got to talk to me like that!

1893
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,591
First thing that jumped out your mouth.
"Who's gonna bury her?"

1894
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,279
Like I'm finna take
that task on for myself.

1895
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:48,352
I'm your wife. Don't push me away.

1896
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,875
I ain't pushing nobody away.
Just give me some space.

1897
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,191
Just give me some room to breathe.

1898
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:25,472
All right, Mr. Death.

1899
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:33,674
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

1900
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,320
I'm gonna take

1901
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:40,434
and build me a fence
around this yard, see?

1902
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,516
I'm gonna build me a fence
around what belongs to me.

1903
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,672
And then I want you to stay
on the other side.

1904
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,433
You stay over there
till you're ready for me,

1905
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,113
then you come on.

1906
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:58,036
Bring your army, bring your sickle,
bring your wrestling clothes.

1907
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,271
I ain't gonna fall down
on my vigilance this time.

1908
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,874
You ain't gonna...

1909
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,191
You ain't gonna sneak up on me no more.

1910
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,109
When you ready for me,

1911
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,556
when the top of your list say Troy Maxson,

1912
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,711
then you come on up
and knock on the front door.

1913
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,757
Ain't nobody else
got nothing to do with this.

1914
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,718
This between you and me.

1915
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,198
Man to man!

1916
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:33,795
You stay on the other side of that fence
till you ready for me!

1917
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,995
Then you come up and
knock on that front door

1918
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:41,710
anytime you want!

1919
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,752
I'll be ready for you.

1920
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:44,160
<i>Bob Clemente with four home runs</i>
<i>and 24 runs batted in.</i>

1921
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,715
Rose?

1922
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,879
I'm standing here
with my daughter in my arms.

1923
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,952
Now,

1924
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:57,078
she ain't but a wee,

1925
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,516
bitty little old thing.

1926
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,069
She don't know nothing
about grownfolk business.

1927
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,640
She innocent,

1928
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:07,876
and she ain't got no mama.

1929
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,992
What you telling me for, Troy?

1930
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,113
Well...

1931
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,230
Guess we'll go sit out here on the porch.

1932
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,797
A man's got to do what's right for him.

1933
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,796
I ain't sorry for nothing I done.

1934
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,114
It felt right in my heart.

1935
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,152
What you smiling at?

1936
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,995
Your daddy's a great, big ol' man.

1937
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:20,479
Got these great big ol' hands,
but sometimes he's scared.

1938
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:24,711
And right now,
your daddy's scared 'cause we

1939
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:28,114
sitting out here on the porch
and ain't got no home.

1940
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:30,390
I've been homeless before.

1941
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:35,316
I ain't never had no baby with me,
but I've been homeless.

1942
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,998
You just be out there on the road
by your lonesome

1943
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,878
and just see one of them trains coming by

1944
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,599
and just kinda go, say...

1945
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:51,151
<i>Please, Mr. Engineer</i>
<i>Let a man ride the line</i>

1946
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:58,951
<i>Please, Mr. Engineer</i>
<i>Let a man ride the line</i>

1947
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:07,752
<i>I ain't got no ticket, please</i>

1948
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,720
<i>Let me ride the blinds</i>

1949
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,391
She's my daughter, Rose, and my...

1950
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:23,995
My own flesh and blood. I can't deny her.

1951
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:27,198
No more than I can deny them boys.

1952
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,596
You and them boys is my family.

1953
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,676
You, them, and this child
is all I got in this world, so...

1954
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,431
I guess what I'm saying is,

1955
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:52,198
that I'd appreciate it
if you was to help me take care of her.

1956
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,360
Okay, Troy,

1957
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,029
you're right.

1958
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,791
I'll take care of your baby for you.

1959
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:16,952
'Cause, like you say,

1960
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,915
she innocent.

1961
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,871
You can't visit the sins
of the father upon the child.

1962
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,111
Motherless child's got a hard time.

1963
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,913
From right now, this child's got a mother.

1964
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,751
But you're a womanless man.

1965
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,832
I'm coming in, everybody going out.

1966
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,515
I'm taking this cake down
to the church for the bake sale.

1967
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,876
Lyons was by to see you.
He stopped by to pay you your $20.

1968
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,394
It's laying right here on the table.

1969
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,630
Well, here go this money.

1970
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,393
Well, put it in there on the table, Troy.
I'll get it.

1971
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:29,190
What time you coming back?

1972
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,636
Ain't no use in you studyin' me.
Don't matter what time I come back.

1973
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:33,677
I just asked you a question, woman.
Can't I ask you a question?

1974
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,830
Troy, I don't want to get into it.

1975
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,314
Now, your food is in there on the stove.

1976
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,675
All you got to do is heat it up.

1977
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,355
And don't be eating the rest
of them cakes in there now.

1978
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:41,476
I'm coming back for them.

1979
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:43,950
We're having a bake sale
at the church tomorrow.

1980
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,830
Hey, Troy.

1981
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,674
What's happening, Bono?

1982
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:47,514
I just thought I'd stop by to see you.

1983
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,432
Wasn't no one at the house,
so I figured...

1984
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,749
What you stop by to see me for?

1985
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,594
You ain't stopped by
in a month of Sundays.

1986
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,512
Hell, I must owe you
some money or somethin'.

1987
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,116
Well, since you got your promotion,
I can't keep up with you.

1988
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:00,714
Used to see you every day.

1989
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,360
Now I don't even know
what route you working.

1990
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,430
Keep switching me around.

1991
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:08,878
Got me out there in Green Tree now,
hauling white folk garbage.

1992
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,713
- Green Tree, huh?
- Yeah.

1993
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:11,836
You lucky.

1994
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,355
At least you ain't got to be
lifting them barrels.

1995
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,636
Damn if they ain't getting heavier.

1996
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:19,280
I'm gonna put in my two years
and call it quits.

1997
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,397
Yeah, I'm thinking about retiring myself.

1998
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,792
You got it easy.

1999
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:27,760
You could drive for another five years.

2000
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:28,956
Ain't the same, Bono.

2001
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:32,392
It ain't like working the back of the truck.

2002
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:36,394
You feel like you working by yourself.
Ain't nobody to talk to.

2003
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:40,474
Naw, I'm thinking about retiring.
How's Lucille?

2004
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,036
She all right.

2005
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,954
Her arthritis get to acting up
on her sometimes.

2006
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:48,397
Saw Rose on the way here.
She going down to the church, huh?

2007
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,513
Yeah, she took up going down there.

2008
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,752
All them preachers looking
to fatten their pockets.

2009
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,320
Got some gin in here.

2010
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:59,598
No, thanks.
I just stopped in to say hello.

2011
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:01,672
Well, you can take a drink, nigger.
I ain't...

2012
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,070
I ain't never known you
to say no to a drink.

2013
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:09,152
- You ain't got to work tomorrow.
- I just stopped by.

2014
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,760
I'm thinkin' of going over to Skinner's.

2015
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:13,150
We got us a domino game
going over his house every Friday.

2016
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:14,879
Nigger, you can't play no dominoes.

2017
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,759
I used to whup you four games out of five.

2018
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:22,353
Well, that learned me. I'm getting better.

2019
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,190
Yeah?

2020
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,429
That's all right.

2021
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:37,269
Look here, I got to be getting on.

2022
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,876
- Stop by sometime, huh?
- Yeah, I'll do that, Bono.

2023
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,636
Lucille told Rose
you got her that new refrigerator.

2024
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:52,158
Yeah. Rose told Lucille
you had finally built your fence,

2025
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:54,078
so, I figured we'd call it even.

2026
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:57,632
- I knew you would.
- Yeah.

2027
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:01,075
Okay.

2028
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:06,149
- I'll be talking to you.
- Yeah, good to see you, Bono.

2029
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:09,790
- I'm gonna stop over.
- Yeah. Okay, Troy.

2030
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:23,231
<i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>

2031
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:33,000
<i>Had an old dog, his name was Blue</i>

2032
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:39,115
<i>You know Blue was mighty true</i>

2033
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:49,114
<i>You know Blue was a good old dog</i>

2034
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:56,434
<i>Blue treed a possum in a hollow log</i>

2035
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:14,313
<i>Old Blue died and I dug his grave</i>

2036
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:19,154
<i>Let him down with a golden chain</i>

2037
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,394
<i>Every time old Blue barked</i>

2038
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,834
<i>Blue treed a possum in Noah's Ark</i>

2039
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,630
- I got to get by.
- Say what? What you say?

2040
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,196
You in my way. I got to get by.

2041
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,952
You got to get by where?

2042
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:53,872
This is my house. Bought and paid for.

2043
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:56,953
Took me 15 years,
and if you want to go in my house

2044
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,918
and I'm sitting on the steps,
you say, "Excuse me,"

2045
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,036
like your mama taught you.

2046
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:01,230
Come on, Pop, I gotta get by.

2047
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,470
You just gonna walk over the top of me?

2048
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,313
I live here, too.

2049
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,869
You just gonna walk over
the top of me in my own house?

2050
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,229
I ain't scared of you.

2051
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:09,960
I ain't asked you if you was scared of me.

2052
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:11,952
I asked you was you finna
walk over the top of me

2053
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:13,520
in my own house? That was the question.

2054
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,000
You ain't gonna say, "Excuse me."

2055
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,230
You just gonna walk over the top of me.

2056
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,310
If you want to put it like that.

2057
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,470
How else am I gonna put it?

2058
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,597
I was walking by you to go into the house,

2059
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,439
'cause you sitting on the steps drunk,
singing to yourself.

2060
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,591
- You can put it like that.
- Without saying, "Excuse me"?

2061
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,514
I asked you a question.
Without saying, "Excuse me"?

2062
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:33,795
I ain't got to say "Excuse me" to you.

2063
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,872
You don't count around here no more.

2064
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,239
I see. I don't count around here no more.

2065
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,834
You ain't got to say
"Excuse me" to your daddy.

2066
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:44,594
All of a sudden, you done got so grown,

2067
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:47,275
where your daddy don't count
around here no more, huh?

2068
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:48,919
Around here in his own house and yard

2069
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,918
that he done paid for
with the sweat of his brow?

2070
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:55,200
All of a sudden, you done got so grown that
your daddy don't even count around here.

2071
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:56,873
What, you gonna take over?

2072
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:01,399
You gonna take over my house?
You gonna wear my pants?

2073
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,437
You gonna go in there
and stretch out on my bed?

2074
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,839
You ain't got to say, "Excuse me,"

2075
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:08,877
because your daddy
don't count around here no more.

2076
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,077
- Is that right?
- That's right.

2077
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:12,674
You always talking this dumb stuff.

2078
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:16,640
- Now why don't you just get out my way?
- I guess you got someplace to sleep.

2079
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:20,794
Something to put in your belly.
You got that?

2080
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:26,236
'Cause that's what you need. You got that?

2081
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,790
You don't know what I got!
You ain't got to worry about what I got!

2082
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,879
You right.

2083
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,593
You 100% right.

2084
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:37,435
I done spent the last 17 years
worrying about what you got.

2085
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,400
Now, it's your turn, see?
I tell you what we do.

2086
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:45,400
You grown. We done established that.

2087
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,594
You a man.
Now, let's see you act like one.

2088
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,433
Turn your behind around
and walk out this yard.

2089
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:53,600
And when you get out there in the alley,
you can forget about this house, see.

2090
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,000
'Cause this is my house.

2091
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,754
You go on and be a man
and get your own house.

2092
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,116
You can forget about this,
'cause this is mine.

2093
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:02,669
You go on and get yours,
'cause I'm through doing for you.

2094
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,878
What you done for me.
What you ever give me?

2095
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:08,397
Them feet. Them bones.
That pumping heart, nigger!

2096
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:11,232
Give you more than anybody else
ever gonna give you.

2097
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,596
You ain't never gave me nothing!

2098
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,273
You ain't never done nothing
but hold me back,

2099
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,716
afraid I was gonna be better than you!

2100
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:21,432
All you ever did was try
and make me scared of you.

2101
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,477
I used to tremble every time
you called my name.

2102
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:26,280
Every time I heard
your footsteps in this house.

2103
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:28,192
Wondering all the time,
"What's Pop gonna say if I do this?

2104
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,430
"What's he gonna say if I do that?

2105
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,392
"What's Pop gonna say
if I turn on the radio?"

2106
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,040
And Mom, too!
She tries, but she's scared of you.

2107
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,474
Leave your mama out of this.
Your mama ain't got...

2108
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,199
I don't know how she stands you
after what you did to her!

2109
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:37,634
I told you, leave your mama outta this.

2110
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,393
What are you gonna do? Give me a whupping?

2111
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,472
You can't whup me no more! You're too old!

2112
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:42,630
You're just an old man.

2113
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:44,110
Nigger!

2114
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,152
That's what you are. You're just...

2115
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:51,154
You're just another nigger
on the street to me.

2116
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:53,630
- You're crazy! You know that?
- Yeah, go on.

2117
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,996
Get on away from around me.
You got the devil in you.

2118
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,276
You are just a crazy old man!
Talkin' about I got the "devil" in me!

2119
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,396
Yeah. I am crazy.

2120
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:03,474
If you don't get the hell out of my yard,
I'm gonna show you how crazy I am.

2121
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,074
Now, go on, get the hell out of my yard!

2122
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,389
This ain't your yard!

2123
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,039
You took Uncle Gabe's money
he got from the Army

2124
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,634
to buy this house, when you put him out!

2125
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:12,110
Get your black ass out of my yard!

2126
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,634
I ain't going nowhere!

2127
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:15,359
Come on, put me out,
I ain't scared of you.

2128
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,033
- That's my bat.
- Come on.

2129
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:20,793
- Put my bat down.
- Come on, put me out!

2130
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,036
What's the matter? You so bad. Put me out!

2131
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:26,272
You're gonna have to use it.

2132
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,840
You want to draw that bat back on me,
you're gonna have to use it.

2133
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:31,990
Come on!

2134
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:34,594
Come on!

2135
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:36,956
You're gonna have to kill me.

2136
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:40,192
You want to draw that bat back on me,

2137
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,159
you're gonna have to kill me.

2138
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:45,830
Come on.

2139
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,952
Come on. Then I'll show you.

2140
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:57,870
Come on!

2141
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:39,151
Go on, get away from around my house.

2142
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:49,910
Go on.

2143
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,712
Tell Mama I'll be back for my things.

2144
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:55,713
They'll be on the other side
of that fence!

2145
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,713
Can't taste nothing.

2146
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,351
I can't taste nothing.

2147
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:29,110
Hallelujah!

2148
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,554
Hallelujah.

2149
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,480
Hallelujah.

2150
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,390
I can't taste nothing no more.

2151
01:53:58,240 --> 01:53:59,594
Come on.

2152
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:02,671
It's between you and me now.

2153
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:07,756
Come on. Anytime you want.

2154
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:12,276
Come on. I be ready for you.

2155
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,754
But I ain't gonna be easy.

2156
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,349
<i>Raynell?</i>

2157
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:32,272
- <i>Ma'am?</i>
- <i>What you doing?</i>

2158
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:33,476
<i>Nothing.</i>

2159
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:36,120
Get in here and get dressed.
What are you doing?

2160
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,873
See if my garden growed.

2161
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:39,554
I told you it ain't gonna grow overnight.

2162
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:40,790
You got to wait.

2163
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,760
Yeah, but it look like it ain't
never gonna grow, Mama. Dag!

2164
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,795
I told you, a watched pot never boils.

2165
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,473
This ain't even no pot, Mama.

2166
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,550
Get in here and get dressed.

2167
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:51,438
This ain't no morning
to be playing around, you hear me?

2168
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,394
Yes, ma'am.

2169
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,037
Bye, garden.

2170
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:22,757
Hi. I bet your name is Raynell.

2171
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:26,674
Is your mama home?

2172
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,357
Mama, there's a man down here!

2173
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,190
Mama!

2174
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,274
Cory?

2175
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:37,829
Cory.

2176
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:40,353
Cory. Cory!

2177
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:44,634
Lord have mercy! Cory.

2178
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,240
Lookee here, y'all.

2179
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:57,074
- Looka here.
- Done got all grown up.

2180
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:58,799
Don't cry, Mama. What you crying about?

2181
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:01,349
I'm just so glad you made it.

2182
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,432
Hey, Lyons. How you doing, Mr. Bono?

2183
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:05,632
Look at you, man, look at you.

2184
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:08,554
Don't he look good, Rose?
Got on them corporal stripes.

2185
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:10,040
What took you so long?

2186
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:11,156
You know how the Marines are, Mama.

2187
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:13,875
They got to get all their paperwork
straight before they let you do anything.

2188
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:17,271
Well, I'm sure glad you made it.
They let Lyons come.

2189
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:18,714
Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.

2190
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,678
They don't know
if they're gonna let him out or not.

2191
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,240
I talked to them a little while ago.

2192
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,630
A corporal in the United States Marines.

2193
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,874
Your daddy knew you had it in you.
He used to tell me all the time.

2194
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,912
Hey, don't he look good, Mr. Bono?

2195
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,630
Yeah, he reminds me of Troy
when I first met him.

2196
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:37,154
Say, Rose,

2197
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,550
Lucille's down at the church
with the choir.

2198
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:41,512
I'm gonna go get the pallbearers lined up.

2199
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:42,835
I'll be back to get you all.

2200
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,309
Thanks, Jim.

2201
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,390
See you, Mr. Bono.

2202
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,592
Cory, look at Raynell.

2203
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:53,716
Ain't she precious?

2204
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,154
She's gonna break a whole lot of hearts.

2205
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:57,000
Say hello to your brother.
This your brother, Cory.

2206
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:59,436
- You remember Cory?
- No, ma'am.

2207
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,590
Naw, she don't remember me, Mama.

2208
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:03,240
Well, we talk about you.
She heard us talk about you.

2209
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:06,355
This is your brother, Cory. Say hello.

2210
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,760
- Hi.
- Hi.

2211
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,069
So, you're Raynell.

2212
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:12,556
Mama's told me a lot about you.

2213
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:14,991
Come on, let me fix you some breakfast.
Keep up your strength.

2214
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:16,150
I ain't hungry, Mama.

2215
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:19,114
You can fix me something, Rose.
I'll be in there in a minute.

2216
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:20,600
You sure you don't want nothing, Cory?

2217
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:22,279
I know they ain't feeding you right.

2218
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:23,760
No, Mama, thanks.
I don't feel like eating.

2219
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:24,910
I'll get something later.

2220
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:28,834
Raynell, get up there and
get that dress on like I told you.

2221
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:43,238
I always knew you was gonna make
something out of yourself.

2222
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,475
Your head was always
in the right direction.

2223
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:51,550
So,

2224
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:54,959
you gonna stay in?

2225
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,316
Make it a career? Put in your 20 years?

2226
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:01,316
I don't know.
I got six already. I think that's enough.

2227
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:04,996
Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.

2228
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:06,912
Ain't nothing out here.

2229
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:11,314
I guess Rose told you
about what happened with me.

2230
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:16,560
They got me down at the workhouse.

2231
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:19,360
I thought I was being slick
cashing other people's checks.

2232
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:22,433
How much time you doing?

2233
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,749
They give me three years.

2234
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,992
I got that beat now.
I ain't got but nine more months.

2235
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:36,750
It ain't so bad.

2236
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:39,839
You learn to deal with it
like anything else.

2237
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:44,077
"You got to take the crookeds
with the straights,"

2238
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:47,358
that's what Papa used to say.

2239
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:51,036
He used to say that when he struck out.

2240
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:53,316
I seen him strike out
three times in a row,

2241
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:57,633
and the next time up,
he hit the ball over the grandstand.

2242
01:58:57,720 --> 01:59:00,679
Right out there in Homestead Field.

2243
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:05,109
He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats.
He wanted to hit it over everything.

2244
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,313
Then after the game,

2245
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:14,397
he had 200 people standing around,
waiting to shake his hand.

2246
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:20,395
You got to take the crookeds
with the straights.

2247
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,833
Papa was something else.

2248
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,151
You still playing?

2249
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:30,913
Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.

2250
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,071
We got some fellas down there.
We got us a band.

2251
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:37,153
We gonna try to stay together
when we get out, but...

2252
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,310
Yeah.

2253
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,911
I'm still playing.

2254
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,034
Still helps me get out of bed
in the morning.

2255
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:45,315
As long as it do that,

2256
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:48,837
I'm gonna stick with it,
try to make some sense out of it.

2257
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:51,435
Lyons, I got these eggs in a pan.

2258
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,832
Let me get in here
and get these eggs, man.

2259
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,957
Get ready to go bury Papa.

2260
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:05,280
How you doing?

2261
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,360
You doing all right?

2262
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:28,954
- Hi.
- Hi.

2263
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:31,474
You used to sleep in my room?

2264
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,752
Yeah, that used to be my room.

2265
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:38,233
That's what Papa call it. "Cory's room."

2266
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:42,472
Got your football in the closet.

2267
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,633
Raynell. Get up there, get dressed,
and put them good shoes on.

2268
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,071
Mama, can I just wear these?
Them others hurt my feet!

2269
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:50,038
Well, they're just gonna have
to hurt your feet for a while.

2270
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:52,555
You ain't said they hurt your feet when
you went down to the store and got 'em.

2271
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:54,831
They didn't hurt then.
My feet done got bigger.

2272
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:56,479
Don't give me no back talk!

2273
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:59,399
Get up there, get dressed,
and put them good shoes on.

2274
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:09,914
Ain't too much changed.

2275
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,640
He still got that rag tied to the tree.

2276
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,912
He was out here swinging that bat.

2277
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:22,314
I was just getting ready
to go back in the house.

2278
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:26,320
He swung that bat and just fell over.

2279
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:32,675
Seem like, when he swung it,
he stood there with this grin on his face.

2280
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:40,273
Then he just fell over.

2281
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:46,877
They carried him down there to the hospital,
but I knew there wasn't no need.

2282
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:52,990
- Why don't you come on in the house?
- Mama, I got something to tell you.

2283
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:57,512
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I got to tell you.

2284
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:59,632
I'm not going to Papa's funeral.

2285
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:05,795
Boy, hush your mouth.

2286
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:07,872
That's your daddy you talking about!

2287
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:10,157
I don't want to hear
that kind of talk this morning.

2288
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:11,640
I done raised you to come to this?

2289
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,040
You standing there all healthy and grown,

2290
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:14,873
talking about
you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?

2291
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:17,156
- Mama, listen...
- I don't want to hear it, Cory!

2292
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:18,560
Just get that thought out of your head.

2293
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:21,280
I've got to say no to him.
One time in my life, I got to say no.

2294
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,874
I don't got to listen to that!

2295
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,553
Now, I know you and your daddy
ain't seen eye to eye,

2296
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:28,077
but I don't have to listen to
that kind of talk this morning.

2297
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:30,720
Disrespecting your daddy
ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.

2298
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:32,559
You gotta find some way
to come to that on your own.

2299
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:35,109
Not going to your daddy's funeral
ain't gonna make you a man.

2300
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:41,073
The whole time I was growing up,
living in his house,

2301
02:03:41,160 --> 02:03:44,073
Papa was like a shadow
that followed you everywhere.

2302
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:48,072
It weighed on you,
and it sunk into your flesh.

2303
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,717
It would wrap around you and lay there

2304
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,235
until you couldn't tell
which one was you anymore.

2305
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:57,513
That shadow just diggin' into your flesh!

2306
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:59,910
Trying to crawl in.
Trying to live through you.

2307
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:05,517
Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson
staring right back at me.

2308
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:08,752
Hiding under the bed, in the closet.

2309
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,878
I'm just saying I got to find a way
to get rid of that shadow, Mama.

2310
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:14,191
You just like him.
You got him in you good.

2311
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:15,430
Don't tell me that, Mama.

2312
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:19,196
- You Troy Maxson all over again.
- I don't want to be Troy Maxson!

2313
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,113
I just want to be me.

2314
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:25,113
You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.

2315
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:28,272
That shadow wasn't nothing
but you growing into yourself.

2316
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:30,437
You either got to grow into it,
or cut it down to fit you,

2317
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:32,796
but that's all you got to make a life with.

2318
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:36,874
That's all you got to measure yourself
against the world out there.

2319
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:40,793
Your daddy wanted you
to be everything he wasn't,

2320
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,394
and at the same time,

2321
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,234
he wanted you to be everything he was.

2322
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:47,279
Now, I don't know
if he was right or wrong,

2323
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:48,476
but I do know

2324
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:51,553
he meant to do more good
than he meant to do harm.

2325
02:04:53,560 --> 02:04:56,394
Sometimes, when he touched, he bruised,

2326
02:04:57,160 --> 02:05:00,437
and sometimes,
when he took me in his arms, he cut.

2327
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:09,391
When I first met your daddy,

2328
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:11,754
I thought,

2329
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,072
"Here is a man I can lay down with
and make a baby."

2330
02:05:18,680 --> 02:05:21,593
That's the first thing
I thought when I seen him.

2331
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:23,990
I thought, "Rose Lee,

2332
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:26,797
"here's a man you can open yourself up to

2333
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:29,076
"and be filled to bursting!

2334
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:35,356
"Here's a man that can
fill up all them empty spaces

2335
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:38,080
"you been tipping around the edges of."

2336
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:46,353
When your daddy walked through the house,

2337
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,113
he was just

2338
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:51,636
so big.

2339
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,033
He filled it up!

2340
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:00,394
That was my first mistake.

2341
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:02,790
Not to make him leave some room for me.

2342
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:09,869
But I wanted a house I could sing in.

2343
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:14,552
And that's what your daddy gave me.

2344
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:18,714
I didn't know to keep up his strength,
I had to give up little pieces of mine.

2345
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:23,917
I took on his life as mine
and mixed up the pieces,

2346
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,993
so you couldn't hardly tell
which was which.

2347
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:32,992
It was my choice. My life.

2348
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:36,073
And I didn't have to live it like that,

2349
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:41,515
but that's what life offered me in the way
of being a woman, and I took it.

2350
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:46,514
I grabbed it with both hands.

2351
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:49,672
And by the time
Raynell came into the house...

2352
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:59,038
I didn't want to make my blessings
off of nobody's misfortune,

2353
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:03,952
but I took on to Raynell like she was

2354
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:07,192
all them babies I wanted and never had.

2355
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:12,433
Like I'd been blessed
to relive a part of my life.

2356
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:18,712
And if the Lord see fit
to keep up my strength,

2357
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:24,794
I'm gonna do her exactly
how your daddy did you.

2358
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:31,154
I'm gonna give her
the best of what's in me.

2359
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:42,150
Mama!

2360
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,391
Reverend Tolliver on the phone.

2361
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:03,150
Hi.

2362
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:06,670
Hi.

2363
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:10,910
- You in the Army or the Marines?
- Marines.

2364
02:08:12,120 --> 02:08:15,352
Papa said it was Army. You know Blue?

2365
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:17,114
Blue? Who's Blue?

2366
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:19,511
Papa's dog,
what he sing about all the time.

2367
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:24,795
<i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>

2368
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:28,955
<i>Had an old dog, his name was Blue</i>

2369
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:31,871
<i>You know Blue was mighty true</i>

2370
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:35,270
<i>You know Blue was a good old dog</i>

2371
02:08:36,440 --> 02:08:38,397
<i>Blue treed a possum in a hollow log</i>

2372
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:41,393
<i>From that you know Blue was a good old dog</i>

2373
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:43,790
<i>Hear it ring! Hear it ring!</i>

2374
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:47,314
<i>Blue treed a possum out on a limb</i>

2375
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:49,232
<i>Blue looked at me and I looked at him</i>

2376
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:52,395
<i>Grabbed that possum, put him in a sack</i>

2377
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,312
<i>Blue stayed there till I came back</i>

2378
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:57,315
<i>Old Blue's feet was big and round</i>

2379
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:59,471
<i>Never let a possum touch the ground</i>

2380
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:02,231
<i>Old Blue died and I dug his grave</i>

2381
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,710
<i>I dug his grave with a silver spade</i>

2382
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:07,470
<i>Let him down with a golden chain</i>

2383
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:09,472
<i>And every night I call his name</i>

2384
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,832
<i>Go on, Blue, you good dog you</i>

2385
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:12,910
Come on.

2386
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,151
<i>Go on, Blue, you good dog you</i>

2387
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:17,995
<i>Blue laid down and died like a man</i>

2388
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,437
<i>Blue laid down and died</i>

2389
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:24,991
<i>Blue laid down and died like a man</i>

2390
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:28,994
<i>Now he's treeing possums</i>
<i>In the Promised Land</i>

2391
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:32,515
<i>I'm gonna tell you this</i>
<i>Just to let you know</i>

2392
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:35,355
<i>Blue's gone where the good dogs go</i>

2393
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:40,511
<i>Blue's gone where the good dogs go</i>

2394
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:46,270
Cory, we're getting ready to leave now!

2395
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:56,194
Go upstairs and put your shoes
on like Mama told you,

2396
02:09:56,360 --> 02:09:59,194
so we can get ready
to go to Papa's funeral.

2397
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:02,351
Okay. I'll be back.

2398
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:13,636
Rose!

2399
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:17,880
Hey, Rose!

2400
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:20,391
- Gabe?
- I'm here! I'm here, Rose!

2401
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,392
Hey, Rose, I'm here!

2402
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:24,073
- Lyons, lookit here!
- See, Rose?

2403
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:25,992
I told you. I told you they'd let him come.

2404
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:28,072
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

2405
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:30,311
Hey! Hey, Rose, it's time!

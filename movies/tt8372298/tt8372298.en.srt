1
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,683
Attention, please.
Your attention, please.

2
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:57,954
Um, I hate to pull you away
from your lamb and cabernet

3
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,023
<i>but I just want to make
a quick announcement</i>

4
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,259
<i>about my son, Richie.</i>

5
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:05,896
<i>Tonight, we are making him
the youngest managing director</i>

6
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,298
<i>in the history
of our little company.</i>

7
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,667
Well done, kiddo.
You earned it.

8
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,670
Well done. Come on.
Stand up, Richie.

9
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,539
Come on.
Get up there.

10
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:18,875
You know, I... I couldn't
have done any of this

11
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:22,712
without my beautiful bride,
Hunter.

12
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,849
<i>She is, and has been,</i>

13
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,240
<i>so giving, selfless..</i>

14
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,655
Well, she is the light
of my life.

15
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,212
<i>Aw!</i>

16
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,360
Oh, uh, my folks bought us
a house

17
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,952
so thank you very much
for the house.

18
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,910
<i>You're radiant, you're blessed,
you're inspiring.</i>

19
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,612
<i>Keep on shining
with new Oradine</i>

20
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,547
<i>Whitening Toothpaste
and teeth strips.</i>

21
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,949
<i>Our enamel protection
technology allows you</i>

22
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,518
<i>to eat whatever you want
and keep smiling.</i>

23
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,009
<i>Oradine.</i>

24
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,860
Wow! Look at you!

25
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,463
Did you miss me?

26
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:41,973
Mm.

27
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,943
This is great.

28
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:54,597
I think there's room
for a flower bed out back..

29
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,000
...near the pool.

30
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,803
I'd like to plant some
if that's okay.

31
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,906
Oh, yeah?
What kind of flowers?

32
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,776
Tiger Lilies, Tulips,
Morning Glories.

33
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,478
Sorry, babe. One second.

34
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:12,237
- I just gotta respond to this.
- Okay. Sure.

35
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,612
<i>It's a great name
for a flower, isn't it?</i>

36
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,915
Morning Glories.

37
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,620
Like the glory
of an awesome morning.

38
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,536
I like mornings more
and more these days.

39
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
This house has great light.

40
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,035
I feel so lucky.

41
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,984
Hm?

42
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,275
I feel so lucky.

43
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,114
Hm.

44
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,361
Ma, we're pregnant.

45
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,298
Yeah.

46
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,467
Yes.

47
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,370
I know.

48
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,974
I will.

49
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,522
Ah.. Wow!

50
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,891
Wow! Wow!

51
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,281
Wow!

52
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,484
Just..

53
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,903
- Whoo!
- There we are.

54
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,005
Darling, what a day!

55
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,975
- Yeah, yeah, this is fun.
- Good news!

56
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,777
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.

57
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,178
Look at this.

58
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,881
The future CEO of our company,
right here.

59
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,216
Right here.

60
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,487
I was in labor
for 30 hours with Richie.

61
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,256
He didn't wanna come out.
He had it made in there.

62
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,626
Thirty hours.
And then, he was born blue.

63
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,127
- Blue?
- Slate blue.

64
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,462
We all thought he was dead

65
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,699
but then he started
breathing and crawling.

66
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,334
And sucking on the cat's tail.

67
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,636
- What?
- Yes. Yes.

68
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,406
Uh, apparently, I prefer
the cat's tail to my pacifier.

69
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,609
The cat's tail was always wet.

70
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,044
<i>You know, Hunter
was a crazy kid, too.</i>

71
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,413
Tell them about the, uh..
What was it?

72
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,749
The... the guy on the side
of the road who, uh..

73
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,084
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell it.</i>
- That's not...

74
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,308
<i>Do it. It's good. It's good.</i>

75
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,688
<i>Come on.</i>

76
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,990
<i>- This is great.</i>
- Ha-ha-ha!

77
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,281
It's not really a story.

78
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:15,064
Um, there was this guy

79
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:18,167
kind of this local nutcase

80
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,537
and he would stand
on the side of the road

81
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,372
into town and he would
blow kisses

82
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,074
at all the cars passing by.

83
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,409
And at first, he scared me

84
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:30,513
because he had this beard

85
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:34,250
and dirty hair and bad teeth.

86
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,487
Uh, it was like this
religious calling or something.

87
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,355
- He had to blow...
- Oh, by the way, Richie..

88
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,459
Uh, before I forget, um, how was
it left with the Carver people?

89
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:47,063
They sent over the contracts
and it's being e-signed

90
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,265
because one of the partners
is in Africa

91
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,000
<i>on a safari or something
like that.</i>

92
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,136
<i>As of when? I didn't know.
I wasn't aware of this.</i>

93
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,271
<i>- Apparently, he took the kid.
- Really?</i>

94
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,240
<i>- There he is..
- I didn't know about that.</i>

95
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,331
Closing the deal.

96
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,069
Alright. Gotta keep up
on these things.

97
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:30,139
Yeah, I... I'll... I'll email
him f... first thing Monday.

98
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,874
- Okay. Good.
- I'll get right on it.

99
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,043
He's on safari. No, really.

100
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,545
Oh, oh, well,
if he's on safari...

101
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,946
- No, I mean it. I mean it.
- I know.

102
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,214
- Okay, fine.
- But he's, I mean, he's out..

103
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,916
It's not like you get internet.

104
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,018
...the Sahara somewhere.

105
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,853
It's fine. I don't care.

106
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,722
I don't think there's anything
to worry about.

107
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,095
Sorry.

108
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:56,733
This ice is totally awesome.
Mm!

109
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,967
- Aah!
- Sorry, darling.

110
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,402
I let myself in.

111
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:35,405
- You gave me such a fright.
- Obviously.

112
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,608
I just wanted
to bring this over.

113
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,643
Self-help book.

114
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,478
I read it when I was pregnant

115
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:46,315
and it really helped
with the postpartum.

116
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,874
Oh, my gosh.
I love it.

117
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,156
I'm making lunch.

118
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,491
Grilled cheese sandwiches
and tomato soup.

119
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,960
- Can you stay?
<i>- Oh!</i>

120
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,029
- I wish I could.
- I can make something else.

121
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,722
<i>No, no, no. Don't bother.
I better be going.</i>

122
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,560
You would look
so pretty with long hair.

123
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,574
You should grow it out.

124
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,966
Richie likes his girls
with long, beautiful hair.

125
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,249
What are you so happy about?

126
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,618
I'm proud of myself.

127
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:38,821
I did something unexpected
today.

128
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,078
<i>What?</i>

129
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,360
You promise you won't laugh
if I tell you?

130
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,651
Promise I won't laugh.

131
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,997
Uh..

132
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,411
...the drapes

133
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,882
I chose sky blue drapes
for the theater.

134
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,150
Oh. Cool.

135
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,653
That's not so unexpected.

136
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,154
You sure that's
the right color, though?

137
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,178
It's a little hipster.

138
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,493
I think it works.

139
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,928
And you said
that I could choose.

140
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,931
I did. And you can.
Of course you can.

141
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:25,189
It's up to you.
I like unexpected.

142
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,070
Come here.

143
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,039
Do I make you happy?

144
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,775
I'm the happiest man
in the whole world.

145
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,446
<i>I love everything about you.
Every little thing.</i>

146
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,714
You're not mad at me?

147
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:42,184
About what? The drapes?

148
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,786
I don't know.

149
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,489
I just wanna make sure
I'm not doing anything wrong.

150
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,890
You're not.

151
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,458
You couldn't do anything wrong

152
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,182
even if you tried.

153
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,163
Mm.

154
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,958
Okay, okay, okay.

155
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,582
Babe?

156
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,219
Babe, did you iron this tie?

157
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,056
Uh..

158
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,005
Yeah.

159
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,340
It was wrinkled.

160
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:40,242
You can't iron a tie like this.

161
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,678
<i>It'll permanently damage
the silk.</i>

162
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,669
<i>It has to be steamed.</i>

163
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,483
You see?

164
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,453
Oh, shoot. I'm sorry.

165
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,821
Do you have another tie
you can wear?

166
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,978
Not one that goes
with this shirt.

167
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,560
Fuck.

168
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,584
Now what the hell am I gonna do?

169
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,223
It's okay.

170
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,139
<i>New Medical evidence
suggests that</i>

171
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:52,241
<i>consuming your placenta
after giving birth</i>

172
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:56,245
<i>can level off your hormones,
increase milk production</i>

173
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,003
<i>and lower chances
of postpartum depression.</i>

174

<i>Your placenta can be dried out
and converted</i>

175
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,420
<i>into daily dietary supplements.</i>

176
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,157
Hi!

177
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,671
Yeah.

178
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,940
I'll be right over!

179
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,298
Bye.

180
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,407
Good. Great.

181
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:44,460
I wanted to be an artist too,
you know.

182
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,629
- Really?
- Mm.

183
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,932
Well, an actress.

184
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,789
Oh!

185
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,539
I could see that.
You're a knockout.

186
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,730
Thank you.
So are you.

187
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,366
Thank you.

188
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:08,406
So what did you do for money
before you met my son?

189
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,125
Retail, mostly.

190
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:20,396
- Selling things in a shop?
- Yeah.

191
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,353
Selling what?

192
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:27,303
- Toiletries.
- Oh!

193
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:31,674
Bubble bath, body wash.

194
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,309
Soap.

195
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,412
Well, lucky break
you meeting my son.

196
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,780
<i>Yeah.</i>

197
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:42,918
I would go to these
illustration job, um..

198
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,188
...advertising interviews

199
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:50,448
and, and it wasn't like
they were gonna hire me anyway.

200
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,964
I'm just real grateful..

201
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,132
...to Richie and you guys

202
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:01,359
for providing me some solid
ground to stand on, you know?

203
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,708
Plus I have so much
free time now

204
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:09,945
for drawing and whatever.

205
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:13,749
The best advice
anyone ever gave me was

206
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,474
"Fake it till you make it."

207
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,445
Are you a faker
or have you made it?

208
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,327
I'm sorry?

209
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:29,487
Are you happy or are you
pretending to be happy?

210
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,293
I'm happy.

211
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,978
- Hey. Hi. Hi, hi.
- What's going on?

212
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,284
<i>No, no, no.
No, no, I was..</i>

213
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:26,388
<i>Are you trying to convince us
how drunk you actually are?</i>

214
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:29,625
- I got this.
- I'm as sober as long as a..

215
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,627
Good thing I was the one
to drive you over..

216
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:44,773
- Yeah, man. So sexy!
- Yeah, get in there, my man.

217
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,975
- Ow!
- Let's go.

218
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,661
Just a minute!

219
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,877
Hey, babe?
What's going on in there?

220
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,681
What?

221
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,831
What's wrong?
You're trembling.

222
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,689
Nothing. I'm okay.

223
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,492
Mm..

224
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,430
- I'll be right down.
- Okay.

225
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:32,280
<i>- Not a chance. Not a chance.
- Get out of here.</i>

226
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:35,383
<i>No way. No way.
You're in cuffs.</i>

227
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,018
<i>You don't even need
a breathalyzer.</i>

228
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:41,156
<i>You're in cuffs.
You're done. You're done.</i>

229
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,625
<i>Who's up next?
Who's up next?</i>

230
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:47,095
<i>Just like, just like you're
back in boot camp there.</i>

231
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:08,672
What happened?

232
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,679
- What?
- You're damp.

233
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,862
Oh.

234
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,731
Yeah. Sorry.

235
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:25,367
Yeah, I'm Aaron.
I work with Richard.

236
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,903
I'm Hunter.
I'm married to Richard.

237
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,271
Congratulations.

238
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:31,306
- For what?
- <i>The baby.</i>

239
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,897
Oh. Yeah.

240
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:40,215
Hey, can I have a hug?

241
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,983
- What?
- <i>A... a hug.</i>

242
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,341
W... will you hug me?

243
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,689
<i>Why?</i>

244
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:50,292
Because I'm not drunk enough
to ask for a kiss.

245
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:58,133
- I'm Richie's wife, remember?
- So, it's..

246
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:01,002
It's just a hug.

247
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,659
One hug, hon.

248
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,696
I'm lonely.

249
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:11,468
Okay, come here.

250
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:45,068

Huh.

276
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,999
It looks like there's
something else inside there.

277
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,249
- What?
- What do you mean?

278
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,518
It's just a glitch.
Let me move the...

279
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,685
Ow!

280
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,554
Richie! Richie!

281
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,956
- Richie, where are you?
- I'm..

282
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,691
- This isn't necessary! I'm fine!
- I'm... I'm right here!

283
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,460
- I'm fine!
- Hunter, I'm right here!

284
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:23,431
<i>What is wrong with you?
Huh?</i>

285
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:27,802
Really. Really. I... I am trying
to understand, alright?

286
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:30,638
Why? Why? Why would you do
something like this?

287
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,697
I mean, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

288
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:38,213
- I don't know.
- You do.

289
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,003
I don't know.

290
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,518
I just..

291
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:46,354
I wanted to do it,
and so I did it.

292
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:47,789
Oh, that's a great excuse.

293
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,859
I've never even heard
of this pica thing.

294
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:52,494
- Just stop raising your voice!
- You know what?

295
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:54,129
This is the kind of thing that
you're supposed to tell

296
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,730
somebody about
before you get married.

297
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,232
You should've told me
about this.

298
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:59,501
I didn't know about it!

299
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,169
Oh, that's such bullshit,
Hunter!

300
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:03,760
Alright? Don't fucking lie to me
like that!

301
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,300
I'm so sorry.

302
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,549
I've never done
anything like this before.

303
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:17,908
I can't, I can't help it.

304
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,658
Shit! Damn it!

305
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,960
Just what the fuck
is wrong with you?

306
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,263
These stupid fucking rocks.

307
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:31,099
<i>Yeah, sure. Just have me
fucking paying for everything.</i>

308
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:33,101
<i>That's fine.
You don't know why.</i>

309
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:34,769
<i>No, you're just sitting here
at home all day</i>

310
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:37,539
<i>making scrapbooks and picking
out fucking curtains.</i>

311
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:40,441
Well, I would think
medication first, right, Alice?

312
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,877
I mean, just to settle her down.

313
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,512
<i>I don't wanna tell you
how to do your job</i>

314
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:50,485
but I am paying for this,
so results. We want results.

315
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:53,555
I think
it might be better if

316
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,790
I met with Hunter alone
for a bit.

317
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:59,894
Ah, no.
No, I... I'm gonna stay.

318
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,963
Yeah, just to make sure
that she's..

319
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:04,854
I'm okay. Really.

320
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,303
- Alright.
- Okay.

321
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,327
We'll be right outside.

322
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:23,106
Do you want to lie down?

323
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:27,922
Can I just... have
the medication?

324
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,825
We can try Celexa
or... or Wellbutrin. Sure.

325
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:33,861
But talking is important, too.

326
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,130
Are you reluctant to talk
about your parents?

327
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,355
It's just a waste of time.

328
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,970
They were good to me.

329
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:44,105
I had a normal childhood.

330
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:48,109
My family loved me very much.
End of story.

331
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:51,446
I just wanna stop eating stuff
so I can make Richie happy

332
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,371
and we can go back
to our life together.

333
00:37:56,241 --> 00:38:00,977
<i>How does it make you feel
when you swallow something?</i>

334
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,260
I don't know.

335
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,894
Good, I guess.

336
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,019
In what way?

337
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:20,864
I just like the textures
in my mouth.

338
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,501
I like the way they feel
in my mouth.

339
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:29,939
Mattress stuffing..

340
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:35,923
...ice, metal
cold metal, especially.

341
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,126
Junk like that.

342
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,396
<i>Does the pain bother you?</i>

343
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,188
<i>Some of the objects you swallowed are,
are quite sharp.</i>

344
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:52,262
Okay. Let's start juicing.

345
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:54,575
We're gonna make you a daily

346
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,579
fruit and vegetable drink
with lots of iron.

347
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:02,283
You see, your brain
and your body are connected.

348
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,352
But right now,
your body's starving

349
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:06,654
so it is sending the wrong
signal to the brain

350
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,057
about what it wants to eat.

351
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:12,794
So we are going to reconnect

352
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:16,631
the mind and the body.

353
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:19,634
Yeah. Totally.

354
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,369
Totally.

355
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,477
Hey, babe.

356
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,212
I'm gonna steal you
for a second.

357
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,247
- We're juicing.
- Oh, yeah.

358
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,216
There's somebody
I want you to meet.

359
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,306
Oh.

360
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,686
- Come on.
- I'll be right back.

361
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,510
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Come on.

362
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:43,324
- Who is it?
- Oh, you'll see.

363
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,448
- He's just downstairs.
- Oh.

364
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,975
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm Luay.

365
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,845
- Hi, Louie.
- Luay.

366
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,680
Who is he?

367
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,216
Luay's gonna be helping you out
around the house.

368
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,984
He's a nurse.
A live-in nurse.

369
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:13,243
He's great with memaw.
Very sensitive.

370
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,990
Doing what, exactly?

371
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:18,181
I'm not a senior citizen.

372
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,921
Look, I gotta work.
I can't be here 24/7.

373
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,803
So he's here
to keep an eye on me?

374
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,205
No, he's here as a resource.

375
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,408
If you're tired,
he can cook for you.

376
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,376
He can go to the store
and get you things.

377
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,512
What, is he gonna be
pulling stuff out of my hands?

378
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:41,082
Okay, okay.
Just relax, babe, okay?

379
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,785
Mom? Mom, can you come
and explain this, please?

380
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:48,389
This was your idea and I just...
can't deal with this right now.

381
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:52,527
You know, I had help around
the house when I was pregnant.

382
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,896
It really takes
the pressure off.

383
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,264
Plus, you're still recovering

384
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,800
from your little stay
in the hospital.

385
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:02,358
Honey, Luay is the best
there is.

386
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,695
Help us help you.

387
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,329
Oh, I can do it.

388
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:42,076
I can do it!

389
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,845
Mr. Richie wants me to help you.

390
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,246
I can cook just fine.

391
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,850
I wanna cook my
husband's dinner by myself.

392
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,819
Go watch TV or something.

393
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,710
Please.

394
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,434
So where are you from?

395
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:07,835
Damascus.

396
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,438
Syria, not Pittsburgh.

397
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:12,273
Why'd you leave?

398
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:13,630
War.

399
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:17,845
Oh.

400
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,947
Where are you from?

401
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:23,439
East Meredith.
Upstate New York.

402
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:26,587
No war there.

403
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:29,724
Just trees and cows
and farms and stuff.

404
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:33,683
If you were in war, you would
not have this problem of the mind.

405
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:39,722
No time for mind problems
when you're being shot at.

406
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:53,236
I have to go
to the bathroom now.

407
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:56,105
Please, miss.

408
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,386
You know what they want, okay?

409
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,777
You know
what I'm supposed to do.

410
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,800
Okay, go.

411
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:25,473
The hospital sent over a report
detailing the contents of your stomach.

412
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,730
It said you swallowed a battery.

413
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,308
It's just so not a big deal.

414
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:42,612
Everyone is making
a big deal about it.

415
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:50,353
Yes, I did some things
that I shouldn't have.

416
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,491
Well, a battery seems like
a big deal.

417
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:57,905
If it leaked inside your stomach

418
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,340
the acid could've killed you.

419
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,564
<i>That concerns me.</i>

420
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:09,450
A needle, a rock, a battery.

421
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:11,819
Why those objects?

422
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,954
I don't know.

423
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:15,945
It made me feel..

424
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,493
...in control.

425
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:21,884
Do you feel out of control?

426
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,868
Oh, um, there was something

427
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:32,273
that I wanted
to tell you about, um..

428
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:35,965
...my mom and our relationship
and stuff.

429
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:42,116
You know what?
Never mind.

430
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,418
Hunter.

431
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:47,788
It's Richie's birthday.
I really have to go.

432
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:49,457
Bye.

433
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:52,393
- Hi, birthday boy.
- Hi, babe.

434
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,829
- Hi, Hunter. Great party.
- Hi, Sara. How are you?

435
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:56,530
Great party.

436
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,488
- Hi, Lauren.
- Hi.

437
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:01,635
- I love your dress.
- Hunter..

438
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:04,338
I love what you've done
with the place.

439
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:07,641
Look at these sandwiches.
They're hilarious.

440
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:10,578
- Have one.
- Oh, no, no, no. Get those away from me.

441
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:14,003
If I eat anymore I'm gonna
have to get my stomach pumped.

442
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:17,785
Oh, my God. Hunter.

443
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:19,854
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
I didn't..

444
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:21,322
- I'm such an idiot. I didn't..
- What?

445
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:22,957
I wasn't even thinking,
and I just...

446
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:24,258
No, no, no. Bev, Bev.

447
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,593
Don't even, don't even
worry about it.

448
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,862
It's fine. It's fine.
Really, it's okay.

449
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:30,765
And we're doing great.

450
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:35,035
Yeah, H... Hunter's made
a lot of progress, and..

451
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,271
- Right.
- Uh..

452
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,306
My mom's got her on a new diet.

453
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,543
- Right?
- Mm. What diet?

454
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh.

455
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:49,950
Lots of... iron and fiber.

456
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,053
- Mm. That's so healthy.
- And fish and...

457
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:54,388
- Right.
- Right, right. Yeah.

458
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,390
- You look great.
- <i>Doesn't she?</i>

459
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:57,491
- I know. I love diets.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

460
00:46:57,515 --> 00:46:59,315
She made all my favorites.

461
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:02,263
Yeah.

462
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:04,520
I'd rather no one know.

463
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,737
Well..
Are you mad at me?

464
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:13,841
Hon, e... everybody here cares.
They care big time.

465
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:17,244
Y... your food's a big hit.
It's a huge hit.

466
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:19,046
You should be happy about that.

467
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,781
Yeah.

468
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,716
I can't believe
you fucking told them.

469
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,186
Okay, can you please
not ruin my birthday?

470
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,443
We'll talk about this later.

471
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:39,934
- Hey.
- Hey.

472
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,902
Can I, uh..

473
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:43,492
Can I have a hug?

474
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:46,062
<i>I'm lonely.</i>

475
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,094
Are you okay, miss?

476
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:08,929
Yes, thank you.

477
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,397
<i>Okay.</i>

478
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:12,855
<i>Let me know
if you need anything.</i>

479
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:20,608
I... I'll be right outside.

480
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:04,840
Ow.

481
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:04,633
I didn't finish.

482
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:12,208
Say you're sorry..

483
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:17,024
...for the party..

484
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:18,981
...telling everyone
at the office.

485
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:24,153
I'm sorry. I am, honey.

486
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:29,803
This hasn't been easy on me,
either.

487
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:32,061
I needed the support.

488
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:36,198
Do you still love me
unconditionally?

489
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:39,869
Of course.

490
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:43,317
Yes.

491
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:45,452
Yes, I do.

492
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:48,255
And I'm gonna try harder
to understand

493
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:50,746
to be more understanding.

494
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:55,951
Okay.

495
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:00,723
I love you too.

496
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,161
I'm sorry I'm such a freak.

497
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,509
But you're my freak.

498
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:10,833
You're my little freak.

499
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:40,307
Let's get back to your family
for a minute.

500
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:41,931
Why?

501
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:45,779
I told you they were normal.

502
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:49,283
In last session,
you hinted at some type of

503
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:51,707
issue with your mom.

504
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:01,083
Oh, gosh.

505
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:05,799
I guess you want me to tell you
about the whole rape thing.

506
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:08,302
What whole rape thing?

507
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:10,370
Okay.

508
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:14,208
If I tell you... if..

509
00:52:14,232 --> 00:52:18,278
...you have to promise that you're
not gonna make a big deal about it.

510
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,069
I promise.

511
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,187
So my father
isn't really my father.

512
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:32,059
My mom was raped in the '90s
by some random guy

513
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,750
and I was the result,
you know?

514
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:40,734
Did they ever catch the guy?

515
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:43,792
Yeah. He did time.

516
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:48,375
William Erwin was his name

517
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:50,299
is his name.

518
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:53,847
Do you wanna see
a picture of him?

519
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:56,238
<i>Oh, no. Not really.</i>

520
00:52:57,408 --> 00:52:59,041
<i>No, look.</i>

521
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:01,310
Look.

522
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:04,458
That's him.

523
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:07,127
<i>Y... you carry that around
with you?</i>

524
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:08,717
Yeah.

525
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:12,988
I've dealt with it.

526
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:16,392
<i>How have you dealt with it?</i>

527
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:20,674
I've thought about it a lot.

528
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:25,078
Did your mother ever consider
terminating the pregnancy?

529
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:30,439
My mom is... this right-wing
religious nut.

530
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:34,009
She's really sweet.

531
00:53:35,146 --> 00:53:39,459
My family doesn't believe in..

532
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:41,895
...abortion even in the cases

533
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:45,199
of incest or rape

534
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:49,325
so here I am.

535
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:59,179
But my stepdad
was really nice to me.

536
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:02,905
And my mom was never
resentful or anything.

537
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:06,508
My sisters love me.

538
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,922
How did it happen?

539
00:54:24,028 --> 00:54:28,998
She went to a bar
and he bought her a drink.

540
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,914
My mom left

541
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:38,518
and he followed her home

542
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:40,442
and he broke in.

543
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:44,046
That's all I know.

544
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:50,297
Can we change the subject?

545
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:53,600
I think this is important,
actually.

546
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,992
I think this might have a lot
to do with your compulsion.

547
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,062
Okay.

548
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,535
We're at the end of our session.

549
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,814
See you in a couple days.

550
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:23,330
That color looks
really nice on you.

551
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:25,421
Oh, thank you.

552
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,368
See you soon.

553
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:53,949
I love you.

554
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:57,920
I love you too.

555
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,090
Mm.

556
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,964
Come here.

557
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,941
Beautiful!

558
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:32,888
Hello? This is Richard.

559
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,960
<i>...connected to her past.</i>

560
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:15,597
What do you mean
about her past?

561
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:25,285
<i>I... I think
her life is in danger.</i>

562
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:27,354
<i>She can't overcome
a guilt complex</i>

563
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:29,823
<i>without your love
and acceptance.</i>

564
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:32,359
No, no, no, no.
What about her past?

565
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:33,960
Please, you have to tell me.

566
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:36,296
<i>I can't say.
Just ask her.</i>

567
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,331
<i>Listen, we had a deal, okay?</i>

568
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:40,667
<i>You're supposed to tell me
everything.</i>

569
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:42,257
<i>Everything.</i>

570
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:47,729
<i>If you won't tell me,
I don't want her seeing you anymore.</i>

571
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:53,502
It has to do with a rape.

572
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:57,673
<i>Hello?</i>

573
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:01,343
<i>Are you there?</i>

574
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,558
<i>Hello?</i>

575
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:06,215
No, I'm here.

576
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:10,530
<i>So as I understand</i>

577
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:13,400
<i>Hunter's father
raped her mother</i>

578
00:58:13,424 --> 00:58:16,870
<i>and she is the product
of that crime.</i>

579
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:19,272
Mm-hmm.

580
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:21,408
<i>Did she say anything to you
about this?</i>

581
00:58:21,432 --> 00:58:23,276
<i>Did she mention anything?</i>

582
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,235
<i>No.
No, I... I didn't know.</i>

583
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,675
<i>No, I... I understand.</i>

584
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:46,032
Ah, there you are.

585
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:48,190
I'm off to the gym.

586
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,738
I'm... I'm gonna get you
something today.

587
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:56,343
Whatever you want. You
want a... a dress or necklace?

588
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:59,546
You name it, it's yours.
Anything.

589
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,580
A bracelet?

590
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:03,550
Bracelet. Bracelet.
Oh, okay.

591
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:05,140
Done.

592
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:37,083
Oh, shit.

593
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,744
Oh, fucking shit.

594
00:59:57,728 --> 00:59:59,328
Holy shit.

595
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:01,430
Shit.

596
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:35,497
Hunter?
You alright?

597
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,145
I'm under the bed.
Go away.

598
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:40,747
<i>You seem upset.</i>

599
01:00:40,771 --> 01:00:42,682
No shit, Sherlock.

600
01:00:42,706 --> 01:00:45,085
Please come out.
Mr. Richie wouldn't like this.

601
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:46,842
<i>No.</i>

602
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:08,430
It's very dusty here.

603
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:15,215
Maybe I'll clean later.

604
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:17,939
Maybe I'll clean the whole room.

605
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:40,573
You're safe here.

606
01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:42,564
You're safe.

607
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,304
Miss! Miss!

608
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:55,630
No. Miss.

I really think it's a good idea.

621
01:04:57,895 --> 01:05:02,764
Just for a little while
until the baby is born.

622
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:06,401
Sweetie, look.

623
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,816
Look how nice this is, huh?

624
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,520
We can't keep our eyes on you
24/7, and they can.

625
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:18,747
Can I stay here with Richie
and you guys?

626
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:25,053
I'm better now.
Really, I am.

627
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,729
I know I went too far.

628
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:38,578
I know I did.

629
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:41,736
It was just a game.

630
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:47,175
A stupid game.

631
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:51,557
- I know it went too far.
- No.

632
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:54,961
You have to go there
so you can get better.

633
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:58,553
And if she won't go,
Richie wants a divorce.

634
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:06,673
<i>It's just seven months.</i>

635
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:09,631
So sign the paper, sweetie.

636
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:14,747
Good.

637
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:16,671
That's a good girl.

638
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,365
Are we going now?

639
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:36,624
Yeah. Hey, you want to
get some things together?

640
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:39,072
- Yeah, come with me.
- Yeah.

641
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:42,831
- Come with me. Come.
- There you go. Go ahead.

642
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:59,392
Oh, honey. Give me your
engagement ring and your watch.

643
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:02,261
We'll take good care of them.

644
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:05,653
We really should go.
They're, they're waiting for us.

645
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:14,674
I forgot my charger.
It's in my room somewhere.

646
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:16,009
Oh, you're not gonna
need your phone there.

647
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:18,745
I want my phone.
It's got my games on it.

648
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:20,346
- Okay, I can go get it.
- I'll get it.

649
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,537
I'm not a baby.

650
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:59,634
- Where is she?
- <i>Bathroom.</i>

651
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:03,371
It's okay.
I checked it.

652
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,960
Oh, please.
Please, come on.

653
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:17,051
Come on, come on,
come on. Come on.

654
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:20,566
- Hunter!
- Hunter!

655
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,767
- God.
- Hunter.

656
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,337
Open the door.

657
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:25,705
Hunter!

658
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:27,306
- Oh, God. Okay.
- Hunter!

659
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,541
Come on.
Move, move!

660
01:09:28,565 --> 01:09:29,742
Hunter!

661
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:31,677
- Oh, goddamn it.
- You got it?

662
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:33,045
Hunter?

663
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:35,348
- Oh, God. Here we go.
- Shit!

664
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:38,551
Hey, please! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

665
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,213
Hunter!

666
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,183
Here, take my car.

667
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:54,500
Stop. Please, stop.

668
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,270
Come on, please don't be a jerk.

669
01:09:57,294 --> 01:10:00,962
Come on! Hey, stop!
Stop! Stop!

670
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:04,710
Hi. Oh!

671
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,012
- Thank you!
- <i>Sure.</i>

672
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:08,970
- Thank you!
- <i>Where are you going?</i>

673
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:05,071
Ah! Where are you?

674
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,495
I just wanted to explain.

675
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:13,101
I still have feelings
for you, and..

676
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:16,838
And..

677
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:22,810
I think I rushed into some stuff
to make you happy..

678
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:26,347
...like where we live and..

679
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:29,484
...the baby.

680
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:33,332
- I wanted to make you happy..
- No. No, look.

681
01:11:33,356 --> 01:11:36,924
- And I just..
- Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

682
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:41,095
Just listen, okay?

683
01:11:45,568 --> 01:11:48,681
I really, really miss you.

684
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:51,450
I miss us.

685
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,518
You know, I've been..

686
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:53,986
I... I want things to go back

687
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,289
the way it used to be.

688
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:57,456
Just come back.

689
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,892
I swear, things
are... are gonna be different.

690
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:05,231
We can go anywhere
that you want to. Just..

691
01:12:05,255 --> 01:12:06,921
I love you.

692
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:10,858
I miss you, too.

693
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:18,533
So come back.

694
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,510
No.

695
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:33,147
I can't.

696
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:41,356
So what are you gonna do?
You gonna..

697
01:12:42,325 --> 01:12:44,559
You gonna live on the street?

698
01:12:45,929 --> 01:12:48,908
<i>You're not good at anything.</i>

699
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:51,444
<i>You can't do anything.</i>

700
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:52,645
<i>This is it.</i>

701
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:56,971
<i>This is the best it is
ever going to get.</i>

702
01:12:58,007 --> 01:12:59,941
Come back.

703
01:13:02,245 --> 01:13:05,246
You come back
or I will hunt you down.

704
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:09,884
I'll fucking hunt you down,
you ungrateful cunt.

705
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:16,969
Okay. I have to go.

706
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:19,394
<i>You get back here with my kid!</i>

707
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:46,025
<i>Treasure the little things.</i>

708
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:53,799
<i>I'll meet you on the train.</i>

709
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:58,003
<i>No. I'm not going.</i>

710
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:05,644
<i>What the hell
are you talking about?</i>

711
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,881
<i>Wait? Wait for what?</i>

712
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:11,116
<i>For a sign.</i>

713
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,820
<i>There are signs all around us</i>

714
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,323
<i>hidden in the woodwork.</i>

715
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:20,459
<i>You just have to know
where to look.</i>

716
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:23,329
<i>It'll tell you what you do</i>

717
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:25,798
<i>it'll tell you who you are.</i>

718
01:15:25,822 --> 01:15:30,135
<i>I've never heard of anything
so ludicrous in all my life.</i>

719
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:34,273
<i>Well, go on.
Stay here if you want.</i>

720
01:15:34,297 --> 01:15:37,076
<i>Sit here the rest of your life
if you want to.</i>

721
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,166
<i>I'm getting on that train.</i>

722
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:06,561
No, thank you.
I'm checking out.

723
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:46,445
Hi, mom. What's up?

724
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:49,870
<i>Hi, honey.
Nice to hear your voice.</i>

725
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:59,058
Uh... listen.

726
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:01,148
I need to come see you.

727
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:04,552
It's kind of an emergency.

728
01:17:05,755 --> 01:17:07,132
<i>Of course.</i>

729
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:10,891
<i>It'll be good for us
to spend some time together.</i>

730
01:17:12,829 --> 01:17:14,974
Really?

731
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:16,342
You want me to?

732
01:17:16,366 --> 01:17:17,843
<i>Sure, doll.</i>

733
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:19,800
<i>You're always welcome.</i>

734
01:17:21,571 --> 01:17:24,583
<i>It's just your sister's here
with the new baby</i>

735
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,620
<i>and it's a little bit crowded.</i>

736
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,154
Please?

737
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:31,023
I won't get in the way.

738
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:33,192
<i>There's just no room, doll.</i>

- Yo!
- Here we go.

748
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:11,539
Yay. It's great.

749
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:15,254
- Okay.
- That's beautiful.

750
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:17,422
That's truly spectacular.

751
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,483
Nice job.

752
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,520
Thank you.

753
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,670
You have your daughter's eyes.

754
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:35,507
No, she has my wife's eyes.

755
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:37,176
My eyes are hazel.

756
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,812
So are mine.

757
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:41,035
Huh.

758
01:20:45,474 --> 01:20:47,608
We've met before, haven't we?

759
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:51,190
I know your face,
but I can't place it.

760
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:52,891
Mm.

761
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:55,594
- Oh, we need a bit more punch.
- <i>Oh.</i>

762
01:20:55,618 --> 01:20:58,230
Oh, hi. I'm sorry.

763
01:20:58,254 --> 01:21:00,065
I'm Lucy. What's your name?

764
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:01,800
Hunter.

765
01:21:01,824 --> 01:21:03,035
Hi, I'm William.

766
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:05,059
Uh, everybody calls me Erwin.

767
01:21:08,497 --> 01:21:11,098
So which one of these kids
is yours?

768
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:16,782
None of them, but I...
I'm gonna have a baby soon.

769
01:21:16,806 --> 01:21:20,007
- I'm pregnant.
- Oh. Congratulations!

770
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,754
That's wonderful!

771
01:21:22,778 --> 01:21:24,289
Can I.. Can I help you
with some of this?

772
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:25,924
- No, no, no.
- Oh, no, no, no.

773
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:27,860
It's just, you know..

774
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:29,261
No, that's okay.
You don't have to.

775
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:31,151
It's my pleasure.

776
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:37,569
Oh, you really
don't have to do that.

777
01:21:37,593 --> 01:21:39,538
It's no trouble at all.

778
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:42,563
- Ah.. Yep.
- Okay.

779
01:21:44,867 --> 01:21:46,912
Thank you.

780
01:21:46,936 --> 01:21:49,948
So Hunter,
who invited you to the party?

781
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:52,150
I, uh..

782
01:21:52,174 --> 01:21:54,486
I..

783
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:57,556
You remember Jill McCoy, right?

784
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,713
She's my mom.

785
01:22:02,184 --> 01:22:04,596
Lucy, do you have
a recycling bin or something?

786
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:09,167
Oh, yeah. I'll take those.
It's under the sink.

787
01:22:09,191 --> 01:22:11,536
I'm sorry. Jill who?

788
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,805
- McCoy.
- She's an old friend of mine.

789
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:16,108
I.. Well, I haven't seen her
in years.

790
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:21,380
Hey, Brat. Why don't you go
and play with your pals.

791
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:23,882
Oh, you never mentioned
any Jill.

792
01:22:23,906 --> 01:22:25,517
Oh, uh..

793
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:28,720
- Jill.
- Oh! Yeah. She, uh, she..

794
01:22:28,744 --> 01:22:32,991
I, her mom,
I went to high school with her.

795
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:35,861
Yeah. Coming back to me now.
I ran into Jill last week.

796
01:22:35,885 --> 01:22:40,165
She said that her daughter,
uh, might

797
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:42,301
you know, stop by the party.

798
01:22:42,325 --> 01:22:45,604
Or rather,
she and her daughter.

799
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:47,272
So I guess your mom
couldn't make it, huh?

800
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:48,507
No.

801
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:50,564
No, she got held up.

802
01:22:51,534 --> 01:22:54,179
So, so, what do you want?

803
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:57,137
Um, soda? You want p... punch?

804
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,586
I don't know.

805
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:04,456
I haven't decided yet.

806
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,525
Can I show Hunter my room?

807
01:23:06,549 --> 01:23:08,226
No. No, honey.

808
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,962
You gotta go to bed.
It's past your bedtime.

809
01:23:09,986 --> 01:23:11,530
Mm-hm.

810
01:23:11,554 --> 01:23:13,365
Oh, come on. Here.

811
01:23:13,389 --> 01:23:15,634
<i>And you're in charge
of the grill, okay?</i>

812
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:18,403
- Okay. Yeah. Alright.
- We need burgers and hot dogs.

813
01:23:18,427 --> 01:23:20,794
Okay. Sure, babe.

814
01:23:36,212 --> 01:23:37,578
So..

815
01:23:40,483 --> 01:23:43,829
...are you gonna ruin my life
or what?

816
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:46,665
<i>I haven't decided yet.</i>

817
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:49,189
<i>I guess I should, right?</i>

818
01:23:55,965 --> 01:23:59,378
- Don't touch me!
- <i>Keep your voice down.</i>

819
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:02,647
I will do whatever the fuck
I want!

820
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:05,250
I make the rules here.

821
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:08,320
I'm in charge, okay?

822
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:09,810
Say it.

823
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:13,225
Say it.

824
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:19,631
Okay. You're in charge.

825
01:24:19,655 --> 01:24:22,300
Hey, where are those burgers?
We're famished.

826
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:24,970
Roger that!

827
01:24:24,994 --> 01:24:26,438
- Join us outside, kids.
- Yeah.

828
01:24:26,462 --> 01:24:28,106
No, we'll be there in a minute.
We're just.. Just..

829
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:30,409
- Can you give us a minute?
- Okay.

830
01:24:30,433 --> 01:24:32,299
Okay. We're good.

831
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,722
Why'd you do it?

832
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:46,947
I can't explain that.
That's..

833
01:24:49,985 --> 01:24:52,364
I was delusional. I mean,
there's no way to explain that.

834
01:24:52,388 --> 01:24:54,188
I... I was..

835
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:00,105
It made me feel special.

836
01:25:02,731 --> 01:25:06,411
A secret makes you strong,
you know?

837
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:09,514
Everybody thought I was
this regular guy, you know

838
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:11,716
but I was important inside.

839
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,252
I was fucking powerful.

840
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,276
I was God.

841
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:25,786
And, um..

842
01:25:27,389 --> 01:25:29,000
...and then I went to jail

843
01:25:29,024 --> 01:25:34,506
and I got shit-bagged in jail.

844
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:38,910
Yeah, they beat me so bad
I had to wear a colostomy bag

845
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:42,114
and then I realized who I was.

846
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:44,138
I was not God.

847
01:25:46,075 --> 01:25:48,342
I was shit.

848
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:02,756
Are you ashamed of me?

849
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:07,261
No.

850
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:10,831
But what I did..

851
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,870
...I'm ashamed of that.

852
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:28,315
Am I like you?

853
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:36,290
I don't know.

854
01:26:37,993 --> 01:26:39,226
Are you?

855
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:43,096
No.

856
01:26:44,767 --> 01:26:48,101
But I just need to
hear you say it.

857
01:26:53,842 --> 01:26:56,043
You're not me.

858
01:26:59,081 --> 01:27:00,280
You..

859
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:03,850
You didn't do anything.

860
01:27:05,154 --> 01:27:07,354
You didn't do anything wrong.

861
01:27:08,524 --> 01:27:11,024
It's not your fault.

862
01:27:19,535 --> 01:27:21,546
<i>Take one pill here</i>

863
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,381
